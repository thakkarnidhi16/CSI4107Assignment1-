   The company that distributes the Salk
polio vaccine is asking for federal permission to test it against
AIDS, after California physicians reported the vaccine lessened
some symptoms of the disease.
   Connaught Laboratories Inc., of Swiftwater, filed an
Investigational New Drug exemption petition with the Food and Drug
Administration on March 22.
   Just two weeks ago, Connaught stopped shipping the vaccine to
California doctors who said they had used it to lessen symptoms in
patients suffering from acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The
company said it did not have FDA approval to use the vaccine for
anything other than the prevention of polio.
   West Coast doctors complained their patients would be left
without a treatment that had shown results against the deadly
disease.
   In commenting on the FDA petition Tuesday, Connaught Vice
President David J. Williams expressed doubts about the experiments.
   ``While we know of no demonstrable clinical evidence for IPV
other than the prevention of polio, the theoretical possibility has
been raised by certain researchers and as such warrants that the
company sponsor a study to determine if the vaccine has any
potential in the treatment of AIDS,'' he said.
   A California doctor said the old polio vaccine has relieved some
cancer lesions, herpes infections, swollen lymph nodes and fatigue
among AIDS sufferers.
   Dr. Allen Allen said statistics on more than 50 patients have
shown the vaccine ``produces clinical benefits after six weeks.''
The halt in shipments forced him to delay a study he had planned,
he said.
   The drug exemption petition requests authorization of a random,
placebo-controlled study at LAC-Olive View Medical Center in
Sylmar, Calif., directed by Dr. Glenn Mathisen, chief of the
center's infectious disease section and clinical research attending
physician at the UCLA AIDS Clinical Research Center.

   Food poisoning, possibly from fresh turkey
fixed for lunch Wednesday, sent at least 75 Ellijay Elementary
School pupils to an overflowing hospital Wednesday night.
   North Georgia Medical Center Administrator John Downs said 24
pupils, mostly kindergartners through second graders, and one
teacher were admitted for treatment of stomach cramps and
dehydration brought on by vomiting. Other pupils were being treated
and sent home.
   ``It's not a serious thing. It just requires monitoring,'' he
said. ``Most are on intravenous feeding to replace the fluids they
lost. We're listing it as gastritis due to food poisoning.''
   Downs said the 50-bed hospital already had about 40 patients
when the schoolchildren started coming in Wednesday afternoon.
   ``We've got them in the chapel and various treatment rooms,'' he
said. ``We haven't had to use the halls yet, but we have beds
available for that if we need it.''
   If more pupils come in and are admitted, he added, ``we'll
probably have to send some to other hospitals.''
   Gilmer County School Superintendent J. Homer Hefner said the
food poisoning apparently hit two classes the hardest and also
struck some children from a few other classes at the 619-pupil
school.
   Lunch Wednesday was fresh turkey and dressing, green beans and
potatoes.
   Downs said doctors suspected the turkey caused the illness. The
turkey that remained after the meal was finished would be tested at
a medical laboratory Thursday, he said.
   ``I talked to the luncheon person and reviewed how they thawed
and prepared the turkey and I saw nothing wrong with how they did
it,'' Hefner said, adding that he has asked the state Department of
Education's food services division to help with his investigation
into the problem.

   The origins of the Oscar, a golden symbol of
artistic triumph, are more down to earth than many of the glitzy
stars who take home the greatly cherished statuette.
   Far from the studios, sun and sea of the California West Coast,
is a cluster of brick buildings in a residential-industrial
neighborhood of Chicago. Under a cloak of security, this is where
the trophy manufacturer R.S. Owens & Co. creates the Academy Award
prize.
   Winning the Oscar contract may not compare with winning the
Oscar itself. However, it was a coup for Owens seven years ago and
remains a source of company pride. The statuettes used to be made
by Dodge, Inc., at a small manufacturing plant in Crystal Lake,
Ill., some 25 miles northwest of Chicago.
   With 300 employees, Owens makes about 95 percent of the most
prestigious awards in the country, including the television
industry's Emmys, advertising's Clios, the Super Bowl trophy and
the Miss America awards. But Oscar tops them all.
   Most people don't know the names of awards in other fields, much
less what they look like, said Bernice Estka, who handles the Oscar
account for Owens.
   ``Oscar, you know,'' she said.
   Each model of the muscular knight, who holds a sword and stands
impassively on a reel of film, is hand cast from a single steel
mold.
   Oscar was designed by Cedric Gibbons, then head of the MGM
studio's art department. He sketched the prototype on a table cloth
in 1927. Sculptor George Stanley transformed the sketch into the
coveted statuette.
   The trophy was named Oscar by longtime Academy employee Margaret
Herrick, who took one look at the statuette and declared that it
reminded her of her Uncle Oscar, Estka said.
   The design has remained unchanged since 1927, and the mold,
which was turned over to Owens with the contract, is kept in a
vault.
   Neither Owens nor the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts &
Sciences, whose members' votes decide the winners, would reveal the
price tag on Oscar.
   ``I like to say that they are worth a million dollars to the
people who receive them,'' said Owen R. Siegel, founder and chief
executive officer of the trophy company. ``Once you have got an
Oscar _ you've made it.''
   ``If we say it only costs a certain amount to make, what does
that do to the image?'' said Patrick Stockstill, the Academy
historian who will hand the Oscars to presenters at the 60th annual
awards presentation on April 11.
   ``It is the most famous award and the most prestigious. It
thrusts a person into the limelight and brings additional cash into
their pockets.''
   The Oscar's value as a symbol far exceeds the cost of the pewter
form and electroplating of copper, nickel, silver and gold, Estka
said. However, from 1943-47, because of war rationing, the
statuettes were made of plaster. They were later replaced.
   Early each year, nine or 10 Owens employees set aside the work
of the moment such as Little League trophies or bowling prizes to
make the Oscars. Each 13{-inch, 8{-pound statuette takes about five
man hours to craft, Estka said.
   The awards are handcrafted in the 100,000 square-foot facility
with cinderblock walls whose concrete floors often are shrewn with
metal shavings.
   The academy usually needs about 100 Oscars, but this year's
order was for 150 because of the Academy is celebrating its 60th
anniversary, Estka said.
   The Oscars are locked in a separate room each night. As each
statuette is finished, it is packed in plastic foam. When all are
ready, they're put in a sealed truck for the trip to Los Angeles.
   ``We don't have an elaborate secret route, but only a few people
actually know when they leave or how they go to Los Angeles,'' said
Scott Siegel, president of the company.
   Once in a secret Los Angeles warehouse, the Oscars wait in
muffled silence for the night they make dreams come true.

<HEAD>The Fevered Cultural Temperature of Thatcher's Britain</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in report for Wednesday AMs report.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   David Hare, a leading British playwright, has
remarked that when Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher came to office
nearly nine years ago, the usually vibrant, challenging British
theater fell silent.
   ``A lot of writers stopped writing because they didn't know how
to deal with her arrival,'' said the author of ``Plenty'' and other
works. ``Now people are really beginning to get to grips.''
   Today, secure in her third term of office, Mrs. Thatcher's
imprint on Britain is indelible _ nowhere more so than in the arts,
where disaffection is being turned into the stuff of provocative
films and plays.
   The topicality itself is nothing new, as ``angry young
playwrights'' such as John Osborne and Arnold Wesker and such
filmmakers as Karel Reisz and John Schlesinger were demonstrating
30 years ago.
   But no post-war government, Conservative or Labor, has come
under such concerted artistic attack as Mrs.Thatcher's, and few
serious works today fail to address themselves somehow to the
phenomenon of Thatcherism, most often from an angry, left-wing
viewpoint.
   Emasculated politically by the march of Thatcherite capitalism,
the left has dug in on stage and screen to attack her bourgeois,
pro-business values.
   So sustained is the onslaught that a backlash is being felt from
artists who ordinarily would stay out of the political crossfire.
   ``I'd much rather have a frank disinterest in culture than a
phony and deliberate one,'' novelist Peter Ackroyd recently said.
``And I find the patronizing snobbery of those who despise Mrs.
Thatcher and her supporters very unpleasant indeed.''
   In a recent Sunday Times article, right-wing historian Norman
Stone of Oxford University said the growing tendency was ``to run
down Mrs. Thatcher, to assume that capitalism is parasitism, that
the established order in this country is imperialist, racist,
profiteering.''
   Earlier, critic Francis King had asked in the conservative
Sunday Telegraph: ``Why is there so much stage Left?'' and yearned
for a play to counter the ``vicious denigration of poor old Mrs.
Thatcher'' which he saw proliferating in theater.
   Many of the works have a common message: Under Mrs. Thatcher,
Britain is becoming a greedy society, heartless to the poor,
hostile to free speech, in thrall equally to nuclear weapons and
America under President Reagan.
   Works both new and old are being mobilized against Thatcherism.
In Alan Ayckbourn's ``A Small Family Business,'' the upstanding
hero falls into a spiral of corruption in which vanishing paper
clips become a metaphor for vanishing morals. Olwen Wymark has
adapted Emile Zola's 1880 novel ``Nana'' for the London stage
because, she says, it matches her sense of Britain today.
   Both dramatists acknowledge the anti-Thatcherite message. ``I
couldn't have written that play 10 years ago,'' Ayckbourn, 48, said
in an interview. ``The disease (of greed) much more deeply
permeates the society now than it once did.''
   The American-born Wymark says she chose ``Nana'' because ``the
book is about the kind of tendencies Thatcher has been able to nail
to the mast. ... I feel very strongly that the urge towards greed
is being fostered, the sense of communal responsibility is drying
up.''
   Hanif Kureishi, the Anglo-Pakistani screenwriter of two
low-budget hit movies, ``Sammy and Rosie Get Laid'' and ``My
Beautiful Laundrette,'' says he and director Stephen Frears want
their movies ``to shoot bullets at Thatcherism and everything it
stands for.''
   ``Because things are so terrible in this country, we have to be
able to look at what's going on and discuss it publicly,'' Kureishi
said in an interview.
   ``Sammy and Rosie'' opens with images of a riot-torn,
rubbish-strewn London and the voice of Mrs. Thatcher promising to
tackle the problems of the inner cities.
   Other works share Kureishi's view: David Hare's ``Wetherby'' and
Derek Jarman's ``The Last of England'' on screen; Karim Alrawi's
``A Colder Climate'' and Kay Adshead's ``Thatcher's Women'' on
stage.
   On television, various drama series consistently portray the
government as authoritarian, secrecy-obsessed, even murderous.
``Spitting Image,'' a satirical program, uses rubber dolls to
portray Mrs. Thatcher and her ministers as Hitler's Nazis.
   More benignly, John Mortimer in ``Paradise Postponed'' has
pointed up the irony of post-war Britain: the traditional
working-class vote has swung to Mrs. Thatcher, the self-made
grocer's daughter, because she, rather than the ideological left,
embodies blue-collar aspirations.
   Mortimer, a committed Laborite, gently mourns the loss of an
older, dreamier, more compassionate Britain. Other playwrights,
such as Caryl Churchill in ``Serious Money'' Tony Marchant in
``Speculators,'' vilify the London's financial district as a nest
of greed, fraud and raw ambition.
   Director Christine Edzard's six-hour film version of Charles
Dickens' novel ``Little Dorrit'' draws parallels between the
Victorian virtues and vices and Mrs. Thatcher's Britain. Its
juxtaposition of obscene wealth and tragic destitution, she says,
makes it ``the Dickens novel very much closest to today.''
   However, some critics feel the point is being stretched.
Reviewing Nick Darke's 1983 play ``The Crimes of Vautrin,'' which
used an Honore de Balzac work to indict a society glutted by
materialism, critic Victoria Radin complained in The Observer
newspaper: ``It is a gray day when Balzac can be bleakly molded to
symbolize the dread face of Thatcherite Britain.''
   But Mrs. Thatcher does have defenders, powerful figures in the
arts such as painter Francis Bacon and novelists Kingsley Amis and
Anthony Powell who argue that the resentment is largely
intellectual snobbery toward her bourgeois background.
   Historian Stone wonders why there are not more films such as ``A
Room With a View'' and ``Chariots of Fire'' which extol traditional
British virtues.
   But Hanif Kureishi feels the truths of England today take
precedence over golden-hued images of its past: ``There are
actually so few films that show life in Great Britain at all (that)
we have to make films about life as it is. There are so many
stories to be told, and we've got to get on with it.''

   ABC won its first Friday night of the season,
thanks to basketball on CBS, but NBC still dominated the Nielsens
last week.
   On Sunday, in a battle of TV movies, viewers decided they had
seen enough of ``Gore Vidal's Lincoln'' on NBC and steadily tuned
out, according to Nielsen data, while audience shares for CBS'
``Too Young the Hero,'' starring Ricky Schroder, increased.
   It was not a typical week, since CBS pre-empted two nights of
regular programming, Thursday and Friday, for the NCAA basketball
playoffs. NBC put ``Night Court'' and ``Beverly Hills Buntz'' up
against ABC's regular comedy lineup, but NBC's male-appeal shows
were apparently hurt by the basketball on CBS. ABC won the night,
the first Friday night win it has won this season, including during
the Olympics.
   The basketball didn't help CBS. The highest-rated of the games
was only 52nd in the rankings.
   Meanwhile, CBS' new lineup of four Tuesday night comedies were
the worst-rated network shows of the week, with ``Trial and Error''
at the bottom with a miserable 5.1 and 8 share. The move to Tuesday
has hurt the critically acclaimed ``Frank's Place,'' and the
formerly sturdy ``My Sister Sam,'' both which were among the fatal
four.
   NBC won the week ending March 27 with an average, prime-time
rating of 15.3. ABC was second with a 12.9, and CBS had a 12.6.
With three weeks left in the television season, NBC has a season
average rating of 16.2, ABC has 13.9 and CBS 13.5
   The ``CBS Evening News'' continued its winning streak. For the
week ending March 25, it had a 10.5 and 21 share, while ABC's
``World News Tonight'' had a 10.4 rating and a 20 share. ``NBC
Nightly News'' had a 9.4 and 19.
   The rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million
households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in
use.
   The top-rated prime-time shows for the week were: ``The Cosby
Show'' NBC, ``A Different World'' NBC, ``Cheers'' NBC, ``Murder,
She Wrote'' CBS, ``Who's the Boss?'' ABC, ``60 Minutes'' CBS, ``Too
Young the Hero'' CBS, ``The Wonder Years'' ABC, ``Golden Girls''
NBC and ``ALF'' NBC.
   One of NBC's usually top-10 Thursday comedies was missing as
``The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd'' returned for a spring run,
replacing ``Night Court,'' normally a top-10 show on Thursday.
``Molly'' ranked 17th and was followed by an episode of ``The Bronx
Zoo'' rather than the usual ``L.A. Law.'' ``Bronx'' ranked 34th.
   The lowest-rated shows of the week were: ``Supercarrier,''
``Dolly,'' ``Our House,'' ``High Mountain Rangers,'' ``Ohara,''
``The Disney Sunday Movie,'' ``Coming of Age,'' ``Frank's Place,''
``My Sister Sam'' and ``Trial and Error.''

   A two-year international study of more than
17,000 heart patients showed that aspirin and the clot-dissolving
drug streptokinase, taken together after the onset of chest pains,
reduce deaths among heart attack victims.
   The Second International Study on Infarct Survival, involving
patients in 400 hospitals in 16 countries, is billed as the largest
heart attack treatment study ever. It was presented Tuesday at the
annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology.
   The study showed that a chewed aspirin tablet or administration
of the drug streptokinase, or SK, improved the survival rate. The
rate improved more, however, when the two were taken together.
   Mortality among heart attack victims given the combination was
7.8 percent after five weeks, compared with 12.8 percent for
patients given a placebo.
   Drs. Rory Collins and Peter Sleight and researcher Richard Peto,
all of the University of Oxford, England, said the improvements
were evident across the range of patients, including high-risk
cases involving stroke or patients older than 70.
   The importance of the study, they said, lies more in the size of
the sample than in what was done. They said other studies were too
small to give a true picture of the effects of the drugs.
   The median age of the patients was just over 60 years, and 23
percent were women. The study was funded by the British Heart
Foundation and one maker of SK. A drug company donated the aspirin.
   Peto said the study was done in hospitals in medically
sophisticated countries, ``but an aspirin tablet will work in rural
China.''
   Sleight said the combination of drugs significantly reduced the
likelihood of a second heart attack while the patient was
hospitalized and reduced the likelihood of a stroke by about
one-third.
   Of 17,189 patients in the survey, 534 given placebos for both
aspirin and SK died within five weeks. Of those given aspirin but a
placebo in place of SK, 447 died. Of patients given SK and an
aspirin placebo, 420 died. Of patients given both medications, 327
died. The choice of treatment was made at random.
   Collins said some doctors were uncomfortable giving a placebo.
But he said doctors were asked to expose a patient to a possible
placebo only if they were uncertain of treatment for an individual
case. They were not asked to reject other treatments if they were
obviously called for, he said.
   The sooner the drugs were administered, the better the results,
the researchers said. But they reported significant improvement
even when the drugs were administered 24 hours after the onset of
pains.
   It has been established that aspirin is of value in preventing
heart attacks and for patients who have recovered from one, Sleight
said.
   ``This plugs the gap in the middle,'' he said, saying the tests
show it can help for patients who have just suffered an attack.
   For patients with a history of heart problems, chewing an
aspirin ``would be a very reasonable thing to do'' while waiting
for help, he said.
   Peto likened SK to a household drain cleaner that is
administered once to dissolve obstructions in the blood flow to the
heart.
   It was developed in the 1950s and ``inadequately tested'' on
small samples for years, Peto said. Its wider use as a heart attack
treatment began stirring renewed interest several years ago.
   It has just recently lost its patent protection and thus can be
made by anybody, he said. The lack of a patent lowers the cost to
about $200 per dose, a tenth of the cost of similar competitive
drugs.

<HEAD>Negotiations Enter Fifth Week; New U.S. Plan Reported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest round of U.N.-sponsored negotiations on
an Afghan peace settlement entered a fifth week Wednesday with the
parties still split on the question of when outside military aid to
the warring sides would be halted.
   A report in The New York Times, meanwhile, said Reagan
administration officials had received indications that the Soviet
Union would consider allowing aid to the rebels to continue after
Soviet troops begin withdrawing from Afghanistan.
   This issue of continued aid to the two sides is the last
obstacle to a comprehensive settlement designed to end more than
eight years of fighting in Afghanistan, U.S. and Pakistani
officials have said.
   Washington has said it will not guarantee a settlement unless
the Soviet Union agrees to stop funding the Kabul government at the
same time the United States stops aid to the guerrillas fighting
the government. Moscow has refused to agree to such a cutoff.
   The Times, citing unidentified senior U.S. officials, said the
administration now is considering an arrangement under which
Pakistan would sign the accord but the United States and the Soviet
Union would have a separate understanding on aid to the insurgents.
   The new position was discussed by telephone Wednesday by
President Reagan and the president of Pakistan, Mohammed Zia
ul-Haq, the newspaper said.
   The Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan in 1979, and about
115,000 Soviet troops are believed to be helping the pro-Moscow
government there.
   No formal meetings were scheduled between the U.N. mediator,
Diego Cordovez, and the Afghan or Pakistani delegations Wednesday.
But Cordovez met separately with the special Soviet envoy, Nikolay
Kozyrev, and with U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Robert
Peck, both of whom have been following the indirect talks between
Pakistan and Afghanistan since the latest round started March 2.
   Peck told reporters as he entered his meeting that he was
``convinced that the Soviets want to withdraw and want an
agreement, and we will stay here until we get an agreement.''
   He said Reagan ``is not going to be easily satisfied,'' and that
an eventual accord ``will have to ensure the withdrawal of Soviet
troops, self-determination of the Afghan people, return of refugees
and non-alignment of Afghanistan.''
   Kozyrev reiterated the Soviets' opposition to a symmetrical
cutoff. ``We would like to see (the U.S.) as guarantors, but they
refuse, insisting on the cutoff,'' he told reporters. ``It's
impossible.''
   Peck, in his first on-the-record remarks to reporters since he
arrived, said a Soviet statement Tuesday that the United States
could eventually be dropped as a guarantor ``might be an attempt to
split the United States and Pakistan.''
   But he said the United States and Pakistan ``see eye-to-eye on
the cutoff, the objective concept of symmetry and the reality of a
balanced agreement, (all of which) are essential for both Pakistan
and the United States.''
   The Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, Gennady Gerasimov, said
Tuesday that ``ultimately, we can do without the American
guarantee'' of an accord if Pakistan would sign an agreement
pledging not to interfere in Afghanistan's affairs. That would mean
an end to U.S. military aid being channeled to guerrillas through
Pakistan, he said.
   The parties in the Afghan talks were expected to continue
informal consultations on Thursday.

<HEAD>Suit: Student Paralyzed By Apple Injury During Food Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mother of a teen-ager has filed a $5 million
lawsuit charging that her son was paralyzed by injuries suffered
when he was hit by an apple during a cafeteria food fight, an
attorney said.
   Francisco Beltran, 14, of the Bronx was ``minding his own
business'' as he ate lunch Oct. 23 at Junior High School 143 while
a food fight went on around him for 15 or 20 minutes, attorney
Kevin Concagh said Tuesday.
   ``One fellow threw an apple at somebody and missed who he was
throwing it at and hit Francisco in the back of the head,'' Concagh
said. ``It hit him very hard and then the apple shattered into
pieces.''
   Shortly after he was struck, Beltran collapsed when a blood
vessel broke in his head, said Concagh, who was hired by the boy's
mother, Aida Garcia.
   In a lawsuit filed March 18 in U.S. District Court against the
Board of Education, Concagh said Beltran has required two brain
operations, is paralyzed on his left side and suffered severe brain
damage.
   Concagh said the lawsuit asks for $5 million in damages,
contending that school employees failed to stop the food fight even
though it had gone on for some time and had occurred on other days.
   Concagh said there were more than 250 students in the cafeteria
at the time with no security guards or monitors.
   Board of Education spokesman Frank Sobrino said school officials
could not comment because the suit had not been studied.

   A cold front pushing across the south-central states produced
strong thunderstorms in Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas on Tuesday,
while wintry weather gripped the Northwest and spring dazzled the
East.
   A 2-year-old boy died after high winds whipped up by a
thunderstorm knocked a tree into his trailer home in Bastrop, La.,
police said. His 3-year-old sister was injured.
   City crews with chainsaws and hydraulic equipment worked with
police and firemen to free the children, who were pinned by the
tree to the chair they had been sitting in, authorities said.
Another small child and their baby sitter were unhurt.
   Near Bunkie in central Louisiana, about 100 miles south of
Bastrop, a tornado destroyed two brick homes and one woman received
minor injuries, authorities said.
   The tornado knocked down poles holding power lines, cutting off
service to an undetermined number of Central Louisiana Electric Co.
customers. Traffic was rerouted around U.S. 71 until the live wires
could be secured, deputies said.
   Earlier in the day, thunderstorms in eastern Texas pelted
Buchanan Lake Village with three-quarter-inch hail Tuesday morning
and produced high winds that overturned an airplane at Mineola
Airport north of Tyler.
   Thunderstorms in western Arkansas downed trees northeast of
Magazine on Tuesday and spawned a tornado that uprooted trees and
damaged a barn and service station at Harriet.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended from western Arkansas and
northern and central Louisiana into south-central Texas on Tuesday
afternoon. Other showers and thunderstorms extended from southern
Illinois across eastern Arkansas.
   Rain showers were reported in Oklahoma, eastern Kansas and much
of the middle-Mississippi Valley, with snow and sleet reported
along the northern and western fringes of that area. Clouds and
light rain and drizzle were reported in the upper Great Lakes
region.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the six-hour period ending at 1 p.m.
EST included 2{ inches at Harrison, Ark., an inch and a third at
West Plains, Mo., and Fayetteville, Ark., and an inch at
Springfield, Mo., and Waco, Texas.
   Skies were cloudy in the Northwest, and scattered rain and snow
showers fell.
   Snow advisories were posted Tuesday for Washington's Cascade
Range and Olympic Mountains, Oregon's northeast mountain areas and
for southwest Montana.
   Gale warnings were in effect along the coast of Washington and
Northern California.
   Skies were sunny over much of New England, the middle Missouri
Valley and the Southwest. Afternoon temperatures were in the 70s
from the Gulf Coast and the southern Atlantic Coast as far north as
Lake Erie.
   While strong northerly winds ushered much colder air into the
Great Plains and the Mississippi Valley, strong southerly winds
brought warm weather ahead of the cold front, from the western Gulf
Coast to the Great Lakes.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 20
degrees at Yellowstone Park, Wyo., to 87 degrees at McAllen, Texas,
and Fort Myers, Fla. The nation's low Tuesday morning was 1 degree
below zero at Yellowstone Park.
   Wednesday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
the central and western Gulf Coast across the Ohio Valley to the
lower Great Lakes and western New England. Scattered rain showers
and snow showers in higher elevations were expected from the
northern Pacific Coast through the upper Rockies to the Dakotas and
across the upper Great Lakes. Snow was predicted in western and
central Montana and northern Wyoming.
   Temperatures in the 30s and 40s were forecast from the northern
and central Plateau region through the Dakotas to the upper Great
Lakes, and across northern Maine; in the 70s and 80s from Southern
California through southern New Mexico and the Rio Grande valley of
Texas to the south Atlantic Coast; and in 50s and 60s across most
of the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Asian Demand for US Tobacco Growing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cigarette exports are expected to rise sharply
this year, largely because of rising demand in some Asian
countries, according to an Agriculture Department analysis.
   In all, cigarette exports are forecast to be up 10 percent to
110 billion ``pieces'' in 1988, the department's Foreign
Agricultural Service reported.
   ``Recent efforts to lower trade barriers in Japan, Taiwan and
now, South Korea, are having a major impact on U.S. cigarette
trade,'' the report said. ``Sales have yet to reach their full
potential in Far East markets, with sizable gains expected in
1988.''
   Much of the increase will be in Japan, which last year was the
largest single foreign market for U.S. cigarettes, surpassing the
longstanding leader, Belgium-Luxembourg.
   South Korea, on the other hand, has ``the greatest untapped
potential for rapid growth'' as a U.S. cigarette customer,
depending on the outcome of a U.S. trade complaint, the report said.
   Overall, U.S. cigarette sales to Europe are expected to increase
slightly this year.
   The growing popularity of U.S. blends of tobacco is ``a strong
stimulus to further sales'' of cigarettes in Spain, and the
Netherlands is expected to ``absorb more cigarettes due to
re-export demand'' from neighboring countries, the report said.
Re-exports are also contributing to the expected rise in sales to
Belgium-Luxembourg.
   ``Gains also are expected in Turkey, Jordan, Cyprus and South
Africa due to the increasing popularity of U.S. cigarettes, whereas
slight decreases will occur in Morocco and Tunisia,'' the report
said. ``In the Western Hemisphere, increased shipments to Central
and South American countries will more than offset decline in sales
to Canada.''
   Exports of unprocessed tobacco are expected to increase 4
percent to 203,000 metric tons this year, with larger shipments to
Indonesia, Hong Kong and Taiwan ``due to the accelerating trend
towards consumption of American-blend cigarettes in the Far East,''
the report said.
   But in Western Europe, imports of U.S. leaf may drop due to
declining cigarette use.
   ``The exceptions will be Spain and Italy where the falling
dollar, lower U.S. prices and a continued preference for U.S.
blends will stimulate U.S. leaf sales,'' the report said. ``In
Spain, higher prices for dark-type cigarettes will encourage
consumers to substitute American blends, thus increasing U.S. leaf
sales.''

   The Agriculture Department has reversed a
2-month-old policy decision and will allow farmers to extend price
support loans for some old-crop corn and sorghum for a year longer
than their normal maturity dates.
   The one-year extensions were approved for 1984-crop corn and
sorghum held in the farmer-owned reserve program, and for 1985 and
1986 corn and sorghum under price support loan. No extensions will
be allowed for 1983 and older corn and sorghum loans.
   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said Tuesday the
announcement on 1985 and 1986 corn and sorghum loans reversed a
previous decision announced on Jan. 29.
   The change was made ``to alleviate grain movement problems due
to a rail car shortage, grain congestion at some country
elevators'' and other logistical problems, he said.
   But the Agriculture Department will reserve the right to ``call
at any time'' the 1985 and 1986 crop loans, Lyng said. Grain in the
farmer-owned reserve program can remain until prices rise enough to
trigger its release.
   The loans are extended to farmers by the department's Commodity
Credit Corp., which uses the grain as collateral. If prices rise
significantly, farmers usually repay the loans and sell or use the
grain as they choose.
   But farmers have the option of not repaying the loans, in which
case CCC takes over the grain when the loans mature, or come due.
By extending the loans, farmers continue to own the grain and
retain their CCC options.
   Parts of the Jan. 29 order still stand, including the decision
not to extend loans on 1987-crop wheat, feed grains and soybeans.
Also, loans that already had been extended on 1985 and 1986 wheat,
feed grains and soybeans will not be extended further when those
mature.
   The reversal was announced here by USDA and by Lyng himself at
the Governor's Agriculture Conference in Kearney, Neb.

   The government has agreed to investigate a
complaint that South Korea's ban of high-quality U.S. beef and veal
is in violation of international trade practices.
   The American Meat Institute filed the complaint on Feb. 16 under
section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, alleging that South Korea's
May 1985 ban on imports of U.S. beef was ``unjustifiable'' and
``unreasonable.''
   Manly Molpus, president of the trade association, said the
Office of the U.S. Trade Representative accepted the complaint on
Tuesday.
   Acceptance by the office ``has sent a clear signal to Korea that
this counrtry is not going to continue to tolerate unfair trade
practices against our beef,'' Molpus said.
   ``We hope the Korean government will be reasonable and move
quickly to lift the ban, which has no justifiable basis.''
   Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said in a statement that he
accepted the industry's petition ``following extensive
consultations with Korea for nearly three years aimed at achieving
market access for U.S. high-quality beef.''
   Prior to the 1985 ban, South Korea was the fourth largest
overseas market for U.S. meat, averaging about $5 million worth of
imports annually.
   Yeutter said the door is still open to South Korea for resolving
the issue through negotiations. But if those efforts fail the
United States could retailiate against South Korea for violating
its obligations under GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, he said.

<HEAD>Reagan Says North and Poindexter Deserve Presumption of Innocence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan says former national security
aides Oliver North and John Poindexter are not being presumed
innocent on conspiracy, theft and fraud charges in the Iran-Contra
scandal.
   ``Someplace along the line, many of us have forgotten that you
are innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,''
Reagan told a group of regional reporters on Tuesday.
   ``What has happened, I think, in the case is it's just everyone
is accepting guilt on the basis of accusation.''
   North, Poindexter and arms dealers Richard V. Secord and Albert
A. Hakim pleaded innocent last week to charges that they defrauded
the government of more than $17 million by diverting profits from
the Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   Although he once again spoke out on behalf of his indicted
former aides, Reagan backed away somewhat on Tuesday from his
assertion last week that North is still an American hero. Reagan
said he was referring to the Marine's wartime record.
   ``I think I was too short in my remark when I answered the
question,'' Reagan said.
   ``I should have augmented that and said why, and that is: Look
at the record and at the honors and the medals that have been
awarded him for bravery in combat,'' Reagan said. ``And I have to
say those were heroic actions and he is a valid hero.''
   North, who has announced he will retire from the Marine Corps in
May, received a Silver Star and two Purple Hearts in the Vietnam
War. He said after his indictment that he might attempt to subpoena
the ``highest-ranking'' government officials to testify in his
defense.
   Reagan declined to say on Tuesday whether he would testify on
North's behalf.

<HEAD>Committee Wants to Add $1.59 Billion in Additional Water Projects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate committee wants to add $1.59 billion
worth of water projects to an already huge, backlogged construction
agenda that is being squeezed by budget deficits.
   The Environment and Public Works Committee voted unanimously
Tuesday to authorize the building of 16 new Army Corps of Engineers
projects from Florida to California, with Illinois receiving the
two costliest.
   The panel's bill is the first water projects authorization
measure to begin moving on Capitol Hill since 1986, when Congress
and the Reagan administration agreed on a massive package of
proposed construction.
   The 1986 legislation authorized more than 200 projects around
the country at a cost of between $10 billion and $15 billion,
depending upon the final scope of the flood control, navigation and
environmental restoration work.
   The 1986 law also forced localities to begin paying a portion of
a project's cost, a proposal that had deadlocked the water-projects
pipeline and had resulted in no new authorizations in the previous
16 years.
   Committee Chairman Quentin Burdick, D-N.D., said the new
proposal contains no rollbacks in the cost-sharing requirements,
and he insisted that the plan is ``non-controversial.''
   He and Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., said they hoped the
committee's action would be the start of a regular two-year cycle
of new authorizations for the corps.
   Once a project is authorized, its backers have to go to the
administration and the House and Senate Appropriations committees
in an effort to obtain construction money. If the money is not
forthcoming within five years, a project automatically loses its
authorization.
   Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, said obtaining construction money
for a project is becoming difficult because of the huge number of
already authorized projects competing for limited money in times of
big budget deficits.
   The 1988 bill's costliest project, at an estimated $775 million,
would be a new lock and dam on the lower Ohio River near Olmsted.
Half the cost would be paid by all taxpayers and half would come
from fees and taxes paid by inland waterway users.
   The second most costly project would be a new phase of the
Chicagoland Underflow Plan, the flood control program for the
Chicago metropolitan area. Estimated total cost would be $419
million.
   Other projects that would be authorized by the Senate bill and
their estimated total costs are:
   _Fort Pierce Harbor, Florida, navigation improvement, $6,742,000.
   _Nassau County (Amelia Island), Florida, beach erosion control,
$5,753,000.
   _Port Sutton Channel, Florida, navigation improvement,
$2,670,000.
   _Hazard, Ky., flood control along a 14-mile stretch of the North
Fork Kentucky River, $7,450,000.
   _Mississippi River, southeast Louisiana and southern
Mississippi, enhancement of fish and wildlife resources,
$59,300,000, with the federal government paying the entire cost
because it is an environmental restoration proect.
   _Wolf and Jordan rivers and Bayou Portage, Mississippi,
navigation improvement, $2,229,000.
   _Truckee Meadows, Nevada, flood control, $78,400,000.
   _Scioto River, West Columbus, Ohio, flood control, $31,562,000.
   _Delaware River, Pennsylvania and Delaware, navigation
improvement, $17,200,000.
   _Lower Mission Creek, Santa Barbara, Calif., flood control,
$10,420,000.
   _Cypress Creek, Texas, flood control, $114,200,000.
   _Guadalupe River, Texas, navigation improvement, $23,900,000.
   _Falfurrias, Texas, flood control, $31,800,000.
   _McGrath Creek, Wichita Falls, Texas, flood control, $9,100,000.
   The exact federal and local shares of most of the projects will
not be known until the corps and local interests negotiate under
the terms of the 1986 law.

<HEAD>US Hi-Tech Weapons to Japan; Star Wars, MX Programs Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Armed Services Committee has voted
to make some of the Navy's most sophisticated technology available
to Japan to help defend western Pacific seas against the Soviet
Union.
   The decision came Tuesday as the Democratic-controlled panel
voted 48-4 approval of a bill authorizing the Pentagon to spend
$299 billion in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.
   The committee also cut President Reagan's request for Star Wars
anti-missile spending and his plan to put multiple-warhead MX
missiles on western railroads.
   By a 46-6 vote, the committee approved the tentative
administration plans to go ahead and sell Japan up to four of the
Navy's $1.2 billion Aegis-class destroyers.
   An elaborate array of sensors and radars connected with guns and
missiles makes the Aegis the Navy's most sophisticated system of
defenses for surface ships.
   Japan wants to buy the ships as part of the Japanese role in
helping defend vital sea lanes near the Soviet Union.
   Some legislators have opposed the move, arguing that the Aegis
weapons should remain in the U.S. Navy. Critics have pointed to the
case of Toshiba, a Japanese company which has admitted helping in
the illegal sale of sophisticated machinery to the Soviet Union to
build quieter Soviet submarines.
   But Pentagon officials say the Toshiba case involved a private
company and they argue that the Japanese government has protected
other U.S. technology.
   The committee voted Tuesday to approve only $3.7 billion for the
Strategic Defense Initiative, as Star Wars is formally known.
Reagan had sought $4.5 billion.
   In addition, the panel voted to approve $500 million for
research into putting the MX aboard trains, $300 million less than
Reagan had sought. At the same time, the panel increased Reagan's
request for spending on the single-warhead Midgetman missile from
$200 million to $500 million.
   The $299 billion figure for total Pentagon spending was set last
December during negotiations between the White House and Congress
over the effort to cut federal budget deficits. The agreement
eliminated the normal congressional fight over how much total money
should be allocated for the Defense Department.
   The bill is expected to go to the House floor late in April. The
version that eventually passes the House will have to be reconciled
with the separate Senate version of the same measure.
   The Star Wars decision would result in a deep reduction from
original plans. The $3.7 billion figure would put Star Wars
spending next year at about the current level.
   Pentagon budget plans last year called for seeking $6.2 billion
in Star Wars money for fiscal 1989, but that was trimmed to $4.5
billion by Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci as part of a package
of cuts he ordered in response to the December agreement.
   The dispute over the Midgetman and the MX involves two nuclear
weapons at the heart of a 7-year-old fight over Reagan's plans for
building up America's nuclear arsenal.
   Congress has approved 50 MX weapons for deployment in land-based
silos, but the Pentagon wants 50 more for deployment aboard trains.
Meanwhile, the Pentagon has been lukewarm toward the Midgetman, a
weapon that has been a favorite of congressional critics of the MX.
   Carlucci told Congress last month that he thought the Midgetman
should be eliminated, but said he had included $200 million at the
request of Congress so the program could be kept alive until
Reagan's successor makes a decision next year.
   Meantime, Carlucci said $800 million should be spent for
research into the rail-based version of the 10-warhead MX.
   The committee's research and development subcommittee said last
week that each weapon should be given $500 million and that
subcommittee decision was ratified Tuesday after several
unsuccessful attempts to change it.
   The panel also voted 43-8 to spend $1.4 billion for a new
Trident submarine instead of using the money for two more
Aegis-class destroyers. That vote reversed a decision last week by
the seapower subommittee.
   The Reagan administration has sought three Aegis warships for
next year, but the subcommittee increased that to five by killing
the Trident. The two extra ships would be deployed in Japan under
U.S. control, protecting Japanese security while keeping the Aegis
secrets in U.S. hands.
   Congress has already approved 15 of the giant Trident
missile-firing subs, which are the heart of America's nuclear
deterrent force.

<HEAD>Worker Notice Bill First Big Labor Loss in Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor unions have suffered their first major
loss in the Senate since Democrats gained a majority in the 1986
election, as senators refused to guarantee warnings to workers
facing on-the-job exposure to toxic chemicals.
   The Senate's rejection on Tuesday of a bill to require notice
for workers exposed to carcinogens and other job hazards ended a
string of union victories this congressional session. In earlier
industry-labor showdowns, the Senate had approved measures to ban
most uses of lie detector tests and require advance notice of plant
closings.
   Sens. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
chief sponsors of the worker notice bill, could get only 42 of the
60 votes needed to cut off an eight-day filibuster led by Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
   ``In this one I've lost,'' Metzenbaum said afterward. ``But as
long as workers are kept in the dark about occupational hazards, we
will continue to try to bring them light.''
   Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., had indicated earlier
he would turn the Senate's attention to other legislation if its
supporters could not muster at least 55 votes Tuesday. He did so
immediately.
   Opponents of legislation often use a filibuster to continue
debate indefinitely and effectively defeat a bill that otherwise
might win Senate passage.
   Unlike an up-or-down vote on a bill itself that requires a
simple majority _ 51 votes if all 100 senators are present _
breaking a filibuster to cut off debate requires 60 votes.
   The hazard notice bill, which was passed by the House last
October, would have set up a seven-member panel of scientists in
the Department of Health and Human Services to identify the most
dangerous carcinogens and other toxins on the job and the groups of
workers at most risk.
   The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Heath would
have been ordered to notify individually up to 300,000 of those
workers a year at an annual cost of $25 million.
   Employers would have had to pay for medical monitoring of those
workers at a cost of up to $250 a year for each. Armed with the
results from such medical tests, workers could file liability suits
against their employers.
   The American Cancer Society had estimated that Metzenbaum's bill
would have reduced cancer deaths by 250,000 over the next 10 years.
   But business opponents led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and
the National Association of Manufacturers claimed that liability
suits could cost employers $6 billion a year or more.
   NIOSH officials have estimated that one in every four Americans
has been exposed to carcinogens or other potentially disabling
toxins on the job at some time during their work life, most of them
unaware of it.
   ``For workers exposed to toxic substances, the Senate's action
is a tragedy,'' said Margaret Seminario, a health and safety
specialist for the 14-million-member AFL-CIO. ``Workers need to
know; it's their health at stake.''
   Hatch and other opponents of the legislation argued during more
than a week of debate that a dozen other government programs
requiring labels on hazardous substances now provide enough
warnings.
   ``It is already being done,'' he said. ``Union leaders want this
bill and they do not care what it costs. ... They just want it so
they can go back to their people and say: `We have done another
great thing for the little people of America,' when they have not.''
   Mary Bernhard, manager of environmental policy for the Chamber
of Commerce, said the bill would have misled ``millions of workers
into believing that they might some day contract a disease.''
   She called the vote Tuesday ``a major victory for a wide
coalition of business groups and a major defeat for organized
labor.''
   Fifteen Democrats, most of them from the South, sided Tuesday
with Hatch on the 52-42 vote against ending the filibuster,
effectively killing any chance that the measure will become law
this year.
   ``They're a little irritated with Kennedy and Metzenbaum for
bringing up all these labor and civil rights bills that force them
to pick between their constituencies back home,'' said one lobbyist
who supported the legislation.
   Others agreed, saying the size of the vote virtually precludes
passage of other union-sought legislation this year, with the
exception of a bill to raise the minimum wage which has been stuck
at $3.35 an hour since 1981.
   ``It dealt a very severe blow to the so-called labor agenda,''
said Barbara Beatty, a government affairs specialist for Associated
Building Contractors, a trade organization of non-union
construction companies.
   Both the House and Senate are expected to pass some form of a
minimum wage bill within the next month, even though President
Reagan has threatened to veto it.
   Reagan also has threatened to veto the plant closing measure,
which is included in a trade bill that he opposes.

<TEXT>
   Argentines may have fallen out with
the English over the Falkland Islands, but the upper-crust still
likes the way they talk.
   That is evident on the quaintly British campus of St. George's
College in Quilmes where Argentine children are still being sent to
learn English with the proper accent and prepare to go on to
Cambridge or Oxford.
   For as much as $7,800 a year in tuition, the 330 boys and girls
who attend the only British-style boarding school in Argentina are
assured as fine an education as if they lived in England, said
headmaster Graham Sims.
   Ninety instructors from Britain teach children aged 3 through 18
the fundamentals as well as computer programming, chemistry,
advanced mathematics and English literature.
   English at St. George's is the most common classroom language,
although Argentina's Education Ministry requires that bilingual
schools teach some courses in Spanish.
   The school operates on British discipline.
   ``We are very strict and that means the boys and girls are not
allowed any physical contact in school. Holding hands is out,''
Sims said in an interview. ``We've all got to lead disciplined
lives. If not we become pretty hopeless human beings.''
   St. George's is in Quilmes, a city of 100,000 people 12 miles
south of Buenos Aires. Once a popular residential area for the
British who earlier this century built most of Argentina's
railways, it is most noted now for a brewery and the school.
   Dotting the 62-acre campus are a chapel, rugby fields, gardens,
two swimming pools, a horse-riding academy and dormitories where
students are required to place their folded clothes and towels on
racks in the bathrooms.
   The only inkling this is not Britain is when schoolchildren
break into Spanish after class or when Argentina's flag is raised
each morning outside the administration building.
   ``It really is a little piece of Britain in Argentina,'' said
Ray McKay, counselor at the Lincoln School in northern Buenos
Aires, the only American school in Argentina. ``The student body is
almost all Argentines from wealthy families who want their kids to
speak English.''
   Lincoln has 550 students, most of them children of U.S. Embassy
personnel, diplomats and businessmen in Argentina. Its schedule
follows the U.S. system, with summer vacation from June through
August. The English-style and Argentine schools have their vacation
from January to March, the Southern Hemisphere summer.
   St. George's, founded in 1898, is considered one of the four top
schools in Argentina for learning English.
   ``We offer a 24-hour-a-day education experience,'' said Peter
Stoyle, director of studies at St. George's. Wakeup calls are at
6:30 a.m. and lights are out across campus by 10 p.m., which is the
normal dining hour in Argentina.
   Student Magdalena Winter, 15, hopes someday to become a diplomat.
   ``Most people here believe we're getting a very good education
so we learn to put up with things that maybe we don't always
like,'' she said.
   Three other top British-style schools, St. Andrew's, St.
Catherine's and Northlands, are in the northern suburbs of Buenos
Aires, but they do not offer boarding.
   St. Andrew's is observing the 150th anniversary of its founding
by Scottish settlers. With 1,900 students, St. Andrew's is the
largest of the British-tradition schools and oldest of the
bilingual schools in Argentina.
   One of its headmasters, Watson Hutton, was credited with
introducing soccer to Argentina at the turn of the century.
   ``Without him there'd be no (Diego) Maradona,'' said headmaster
Kevan Prior, referring to the star of Argentina's 1986 World Cup
champions.
   St. Andrew's has been coed since 1980.
   ``We have a particular ethos, particular spirit, something the
parents of Argentine upper middle-class children choose,'' Prior
said.
   Tuition is $1,600 to $2,400 a year.
   Northlands School near St. Andrew's is considered the top girls
school in Argentina. Headmistress Jehane Taylor takes pains to
separate her school from anything British.
   ``This is an Argentine school with no funds from England that
happens to teach English,'' she said.
   Sensitivities over anything British comes from problems
regarding the Britain's Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic, off
Argentina. The Argentines have claimed them since 1833 and here
they are called the Malvinas. Argentina invaded the Falklands in
April 1982 and were driven off by British forces three months later.
   ``During the Falklands these British-style schools got lots of
phone treats, some of them obscene,'' said McKay of the American
school. ``Some kids were pulled out by their parents and there were
some classroom tiffs over the so-called imperialist British.
   ``So it's really kind of remarkable now that so many Argentines
send their kids to these schools. I suppose it's kind of the snob
thing to do.''
   St. Catherine's School for girls, like St. George's, offers the
international baccalaurete program for its 1,100 students. The
program allows students to enter colleges in the United States at a
second-year level or qualify for advanced study in England.
   A St. Catherine's coordinator, Marie Philpotts, described the
school as ``British to a certain extent.'' Tuition ranges from
$1,050 to $1,600 a year compared to $1,000 to $2,000 a year at
Northlands.
   Mrs. Taylor, head of Northlands, said the tradition of
Argentines sending their children to English-style schools goes
back several generations.
   The school, founded by a British governess in 1920, gives 985
students ``an Anglo-Saxon point of view and a Latin point of
view,'' giving students ``different ways of looking at knowledge,''
Mrs. Taylor said.

<HEAD>High Court Weighs Arguments in Ohio Gasohol Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES HANNAH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court is weighing arguments on the
constitutionality of Ohio's ``gasohol'' tax credits, defended by
state officials as legitimate incentives but attacked by opponents
as discriminatory.
   Herman Schwartz, an attorney for the New Energy Co. of Indiana,
said Tuesday that New Energy was ``inevitably excluded'' from
selling ethanol in Ohio after Ohio limited the tax benefits to
companies in states that provide reciprocal incentives.
   ``It's a discriminatory tax on its face,'' Schwartz told the
justices during oral arguments in the case.
   Gasohol is a blend of 90 percent gasoline and 10 percent
ethanol, which is derived from corn and cereal grain.
   Most states and the federal government have offered tax credits
for the production and sale of gasohol, which reduces toxic
emissions from leaded motor vehicle fuels.
   Initially, Ohio had offered tax credits for ethanol regardless
of where it was produced. But in 1985 the state legislature
restricted the credit to those states that give a similar tax
incentive to Ohio-produced ethanol.
   That reciprocity feature was challenged by New Energy, which
produces ethanol at its South Bend, Ind., plant. The company was
shipping about 25 percent of its output to Ohio distributors in
1985 and expected to be able to ship 35 percent eventually.
   ``Taxes can have the same effect as an absolute ban,'' said
Schwartz. ``This statute is clearly unconstitutional under the
commerce clause.''
   The Ohio Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law
last year by a vote of 4-3, saying it did not bar interstate
commerce.
   Attorneys for the Ohio tax commissioner have argued that the
provision is intended to encourage the use of ethanol in Ohio and
neighboring states as a substitute for leaded gasoline, a major
source of air pollution.
   Richard Farrin, assistant attorney general of Ohio, told the
court the provision does not bar the sale of out-of-state ethanol
in Ohio. And he said it does not interfere with private-market
forces, but simply provides an incentive for the production of
ethanol.
   ``We're looking to have a national market that we think is
essential for the future of the ethanol industry,'' said Farrin.
``It's to encourage Indiana and other states to grant ethanol
credits.''
   Farrin also said the provision was enacted to protect the
environment, create an alternate market for corn and help lessen
dependence upon foreign oil.
   ``These purposes are legitimate purposes for a state to
pursue,'' said Farrin.
   But he was bombarded by questions from the justices.
   Justice Anthony Kennedy asked whether the Ohio provision did not
penalize some companies while helping others. And Justice John Paul
Stevens asked why Ohio was concerned about clean air in Indiana.
   ``The air in Indiana comes into Ohio,'' Farrin replied. ``I
don't think environmental concerns stop at state lines.''
   Justice Antonin Scalia asked Farrin what is to keep Ohio from
``fiddling with'' markets other than gasohol. And Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor said the high court has so far invalidated all such
reciprocal laws.
   ``Find some cases where we have upheld this type of a scheme,''
she told Farrin.
   The court is expected to issue a decision in the case by July.

   More ultraviolet light suppresses marine
productivity in the Antarctic, according to findings of new
research on the Antarctic ozone hole.
   Sayed El-Sayed of Texas A&M University said Tuesday his findings
could mean the existence of a threat to the krill, a tiny
shrimp-like creature on which all Antarctic life depends directly
or indirectly.
   If the krill goes, ``the whole ecosystem probably would
collapse,'' and the whales, seals, penguins, birds and fish would
disappear, he told reporters at a briefing arranged by the World
Resources Institute, a Washington environmental policy research
institute that has called attention to ozone problems.
   The ozone layer high above the earth thins by about half over
Antarctica each spring, letting more ultraviolet light reach the
ground. If this happened over the globe as a whole, the
Environmental Protection Agency says, each 1 percent decline in
ozone would mean a 2 percent increase in ultraviolet radiation and
a 4.8 percent to 7.5 percent increase in the most common skin
cancer.
   The krill, which are an inch or two long, feed on phytoplankton,
which are invisible to the naked eye. Fish and marine mammals in
turn feed on the krill.
   A 10 percent harvest of the 550 million to 770 million tons of
protein represented by the krill could equal the entire fish catch
of the world, and several nations are studying use of such a
protein resource.
   El-Sayed and his students at an island near Palmer Station
labeled test tanks of southern ocean water containing
phytoplankton, the ``grass of the sea,'' with radioactive calcium
carbonate.
   The radioactivity of the plankton after taking up the carbon
isotope is a measure of photosynthesis, the process by which plants
live, deriving energy from sunlight.
   Samples to which extra ultraviolet had been added showed far
less radioactivity: 1,000 counts per minute on a scintillation
counter as opposed to 15,000 counts per minute for the sample from
which all ultraviolet had been excluded.
   The extra ultraviolet was about 6.5 percent of what was already
in the light. On the day the measurements were made, ozone overhead
was only about 80 percent of normal, so the light was already
presumably enriched in ultraviolet.
   Ultraviolet reaching the ground in Antarctica is not as much as
it would be elsewhere under the same ozone layer. The sun is low in
the sky and its light travels a long slant distance through the
ozone.
   Scientists attribute the Antarctic ozone hole, and a newly
discerned average 2.3 percent year-round ozone decline in northern
mid-latitudes since 1969, to man-made chemicals called
chlorofluorocarbons. Major producing nations agreed in Montreal
last year to a 50 percent cut in production by 1998, and last week
du Pont Co. said it planned to stop manufacture.
   Lee M. Thomas, administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency, told reporters Tuesday that in light of the mid-latitude
decline, he would seek to accelerate the scientific review called
for by the treaty so that participating nations could consider
further production cuts when 1990 opens.
   But Thomas said he would not support bills in the Senate,
subject of a hearing today, calling for an early 95 percent cut in
U.S. production.
   Sayed, a biological oceanographer with 25 years of experience in
the Antarctic, was supported in his work last fall on Anvers Island
near Palmer Station by the National Science Foundation.

   How to shop in a city with horrendous traffic,
boutiques that close for two hours at lunch and sales clerks who
are imperious, or just plain rude? Maribeth Clemente knows, and
helps fellow Americans for a fee.
   With an investment of less than $9,000, she started a business
called Chic Promenade last June to counsel visitors and shepherd
them through the array of stores and shops in the ``city of light.''
   Ms. Clemente, a 26-year-old native of Troy, N.Y., takes up to
four people on a tour of six to 12 boutiques in an average day,
with a midafternoon break in a cozy tea room.
   Clients are met at their hotels in a minibus for the tour, which
costs about $70 each.
   Some customers might find the service worth every centime just
for the way Ms. Clemente shields them from salespeople. She usually
chooses shops known for hospitality, but when needed steps in to
act as a buffer.
   ``If the sales people want to be snippy, I can take it,'' she
said. ``I know their racket and understand their mentality.
Americans are very sensitive to how they're treated and a rude
sales clerk can ruin a fun afternoon.''
   Between stores, she is a first-rate tour guide, giving
interesting background on historic neighborhoods, French
celebrities and the boutiques themselves.
   On a recent afternoon, shoppers learned a bit about French
chocolate-eating habits before visiting the capital's oldest
chocolatier. Ms. Clemente says she does not take commissions from
the stores she visits.
   Ms. Clemente is a graduate in international management of
Simmons College in Boston. She spent her junior year in Paris, fell
in love with it and returned after graduation.
   After much time spent as guide and consultant to friends and
relatives, she said, it was a logical decision to make a business
of it.
   Most of her clients are Americans who don't speak French. She
translates explanations given by clerks and does quick conversions
between francs and dollars. She also briefs clients on applying for
reimbursement of sales taxes paid on items taken out of the country.
   Most clients seek items that are authentically French, such as
perfumes, wines and cookware, spending an average of about $300
each in an afternoon.
   Each tour is tailored to the interests of the clients, and Ms.
Clemente chooses the shops to be visited from a long list in her
memory. An afternoon could be devoted to antique silver,
tapestries, glass, clothing or a combination of things.
   ``I don't even think about bargains,'' she said, adding that the
falling dollar means ``there aren't any left.''
   Instead, she offers the uniqueness of stores that are not listed
in tourist shopping guides and carry items ``you won't find on
Madison Avenue.''
   Costume jewelry, for example, is a great buy in Paris.
   ``Price-wise and in terms of selection and uniqueness of design,
some Paris boutiques have an edge over the United States,'' Ms.
Clemente said.
   The most challenging part of her job is revising her repertoire
of boutiques stay current. ``I'm on the streets so much, I spot new
places before the French fashion magazines do,'' she said.

<HEAD>Judge Voids Training Of Non-Union Pilots By Other Airline For
Eastern</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Using an air cargo company to train non-union
pilots to fly Eastern Airlines jets in a possible strike against
that passenger airline violates Eastern's labor agreement, a
federal judge ruled in blocking the activity.
   U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker issued the preliminary
injunction pending trial on a lawsuit by the Air Line Pilots
Association. The order says Eastern must stop training non-union
pilots on its planes by Orion Lift Services, Inc.
   In the order handed down late Tuesday, Parker said the training
program ``constitutes a unilateral repudiation of the collective
bargaining agreement'' Eastern has with the pilots union.
   ``The plain language of the agreement requires that Eastern
utilize pilots from the system seniority list to perform any type
of flying'' _ including flight training, the judge said.
   Moreover, ``Eastern has failed to offer a reasonable
interpretation of the contract which would justify its conduct nor
has it proven that this type of leasing arrangement is justified by
past practices,'' Parker said.
   The judge dismissed as ``completely spurious'' the company's
argument it was entitled to engage in strike preparations
``irrespective of the terms of its agreement with ALPA.''
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said the Miami-based airline
would not comment on the decision until company officials had an
opportunity to review it.
   Orion, based in Raleigh, N.C., signed a contract earlier this
year to hire and train 350 to 400 non-union pilots to fly Eastern
planes in the event ALPA honored a possible strike by 13,000
airline employees represented by the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers.
   The agreement called for Orion to fly as many as 25 Eastern
planes out of Atlanta during a strike. The pilots union has not
indicated whether it would honor a machinists strike.
   One aircraft was leased to the company to train non-union pilots
in Louisville and Eastern officials testified that as many as five
more would be transferred to Orion for that purpose.
   Orion needed to conduct the training on Eastern planes to obtain
Federal Aviation Administration certification to carry passengers
in the event of a walkout.
   The machinists' union and Eastern are now conducting
negotiations under the auspices of the National Mediation Board. If
the board declares an impasse, the union could strike following a
30-day cooling off period that is prescribed by the Railway Labor
Act.
   The pilots union has not said whether it would honor a
machinists strike. ALPA itself is preparing to begin negotiations
with Eastern to update its contract, which will be open for changes
in June.
   Parker barred the airline from unilaterally changing its labor
agreement with the pilots union.
   He also enjoined Eastern from using any pilots not on the
union's seniority list ``as a means of undermining ALPA's status as
the exclusive collective bargaining representative for the airline
pilots employed by Eastern.''
   The decision is the second legal setback for the financially
troubled airline this month.
   On March 10, another federal judge here held the airline in
contempt of court for taking steps to sell its Eastern Air Shuttle
to another subsidiary created by the company's parent, Texas Air.
   U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt also ordered Eastern to pay a
fine of $10,000 for each day it was in contempt of his order after
April 5. A federal appeals court last week refused to stay the
contempt order.

   A group of American experts on the supernatural
found that the only thing special about Chinese reputed to have
magic powers was their ability to disappear when asked to prove
their claims.
   ``They failed all the tests,'' said Dr. Paul Kurtz, chairman of
the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the
Paranormal and professor of philosophy at State University of New
York at Buffalo.
   Kurtz said in particular his six-member delegation had seen no
scientific evidence to back up claims from masters of the Chinese
martial art of ``qigong'' that they can cure tumors and help
cripples walk through energy emanating from their fingers.
   The Americans arrived in China March 21 at the invitation of the
Chinese newspaper Science and Technology Daily to give lectures to
Chinese scientists and academics on how to evaluate paranormal
activity, or psychic phenomena outside the range of the normal.
   They have also tried, with limited success, to test qigong
masters and Chinese clairvoyants. One group of masters failed to
appear for a demonstration of their skills, as did two children
said to be able to read Chinese characters in sealed envelopes.
   The group did witness one qigong master who said he could make a
woman shake convulsively, even if she was in the next room as
demanded by the American skeptics. The woman did shake, Kurtz said,
and continued to shake when the master, unbeknownst to her, was
ordered by the Americans to stop zapping her.
   They also tested a clairvoyant who claimed she could diagnose
body conditions of people in the United States just by reading
their name on a piece of paper. Kurtz said his daughter, who has
diabetes, was diagnosed as being pregnant.
   James Randi, a well-known conjurer and expert on the paranormal,
said the clairvoyant failed to realize that his mother had been
dead for several years.
   Lin Zixin, director general and chief editor of the Science and
Technology Daily, said the paper invited the Americans to China
because of ``growing confusion between science and superstition in
China.''
   He said there has been some opposition to the American mission.
   ``Some ask why we should bring foreign people to contradict our
traditional treasures'' like qigong.
   The government gives official support to the study of qigong,
which in its less fantastic forms is an ancient system of
deep-breathing exercises practiced daily in parks and along roads
by millions of Chinese.
   Controversy comes in with masters who say that through
controlled breathing they can channel vital energy to turn on light
bulbs and radios, cure diseases and fry fish. They aim for the same
body points used by acupuncturists with their needles, but without
ever touching the patient.
   China's official media frequently warns that superstition and
sorcery, supposedly squelched when the Communists came to power in
1949, are staging a strong comeback, particularly in rural areas.
   The media at the same time often prints articles about children
able to read a newspaper by sitting on it, UFO sightings, giant
hairy wild men and Loch Ness-style monsters.
   Masters have held healing rallies attended by 10,000 people, and
have made claims, carried in the official press, that they can cure
AIDS from thousands of miles away.
   ``This is serious for our country and modernization,'' Lin said.
Qigong may have some beneficial effects, he said, ``but now
paranormal activity like ESP and psychokinesis are being put under
the qigong umbrella.''
   Lin said China's reforms over the last decade, which have given
people more economic freedom, are partly responsible for rising
interest in the supernatural.
   ``Ten years ago the state had much stronger controls,'' he said.
   He said a survey of 300 educated Chinese attending one of
Kurtz's lectures found that half believed in the paranormal.
   Qian Xingsha, vice director of the Human Body Information Study
Society, told the American skeptics that ``you're not being
broad-minded enough.''
   ``They simply don't believe,'' she said in an aside to a
colleague.
   Randi, who uses his skills as a magician to debunk psychic
trickery, said there were ``high school explanations'' to most of
the feats of qigong masters.
   ``They believe in themselves because they've never been
tested,'' he said.
   The Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the
Paranormal has offices in 18 countries and puts out a journal
called ``Skeptical Inquirer.'' Among committee members are
astronomer Carl Sagan, psychologist B.F. Skinner and author Isaac
Asimov.

<HEAD>Reagan Neutrality In GOP Race Could End In Wake Of Dole Withdrawal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House says Sen. Bob Dole's
withdrawal from presidential contention could change President
Reagan's proclaimed stance of neutrality in the race for the
Republican nomination.
   ``The president's position all along has been that he wouldn't
work for the candidate until there was a clear choice and we had
presumed all along that would be at the convention,'' presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday after Dole's announcement.
   ``This does change things somewhat and the situation could
change, but I haven't heard any discussion of it,'' he said.
   Dole's withdrawal leaves only Vice President George Bush and
former religious broadcaster Pat Robertson in the GOP field.
   Even while maintaining his neutrality, Reagan has consistently
spoken in glowing terms of Bush, telling television personality
David Frost in a Nov. 28 interview, for instance, that Bush ``has
been the finest vice president in my memory in this country.''
   On the other hand he has spoken slightingly of Robertson. At his
Feb. 24 news conference, after Robertson claimed that his Christian
Broadcasting Network had known and announced the location of
American hostages in Lebanon, Reagan said, ``Isn't it strange that
no one in our administration was ever apprised of that? If he
thought he knew, he kept it to himself.''
   At the time of Nancy Reagan's hospitalization for breast cancer
surgery last year, Robertson made a remark that the president
interpreted as criticism of the first lady. Talking to reporters
before a scheduled White House meeting of GOP presidential
hopefuls, Reagan said of the comment, ``I'll see if he brings it
up.''
   The president eventually canceled the meeting altogether,
reportedly in anger over the Robertson remark, and it was never
rescheduled.
   Despite the apparent contrast in Reagan's views of the two
surviving contenders, both White House political director Frank
Donatelli and his predecessor, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., said in
recent interviews that they expected the president to maintain his
stance of neutrality after Dole's anticipated withdrawal.
   For one reason, they said, there would be little pressure for
Reagan to enter the fray now, since Bush is so far ahead that
Robertson is no threat to him. Robertson has acknowledged Bush's
victory and is a candidate in name only.
   Stephen Hess, an expert on presidential politics with the
Brookings Institute, called the president's neutrality ``a modest
fiction'' that ``probably can't do any harm.''
   ``Everybody knows, including George Bush and all who are
interested in being involved in the campaign, exactly where
Reagan's heart is,'' Hess said.

   Congress can save its sweeping trade bill from
a presidential veto if lawmakers drop a provision requiring advance
notice of plant closings, says the nation's top trade negotiator.
   ``My judgment is that it would precipitate a veto if it
remains,'' U.S. Trade Representative Clayton K. Yeutter said
Tuesday.
   His comment came hours before a House-Senate panel voted to
approve the provision, which would require employers to serve
60-day notice of impending plant closings involving 100 or more
employees.
   Companies would be required to give notice of any layoff of 50
or more workers if those being furloughed made up at least one
third of the work force at the plant.
   In layoffs involving 500 or more workers, notice would be
required regardless of whether they represented one-third of the
work force.
   An exemption would be provided for faltering businesses.
Violation would carry a penalty of up to $500 a day, payable to
local governments.
   The plant closings issue was fiercely debated when the Senate
approved the 1,000-page trade bill last year and decided to include
such a provision. Business groups say it would spawn lawsuits by
communities trying to save factory jobs. The House omitted such a
plan from its version of the bill.
   President Reagan said Monday in a speech in Richmond, Va., that
the plant-closings provision was one of three that would prompt him
to veto the trade bill.
   The others were mandatory import curbs and disclosure of foreign
ownership of property in the United States _ issues lawmakers hope
to resolve before their spring break next week. They have been
tentatively planning to bring a final product to the floor soon
after they return.
   The plant-closings provision was approved on a voice vote by a
subcommittee of the House-Senate conference committee on the trade
bill.
   Its inclusion and resulting concern over a possible veto raised
the question of whether the subcommittee could be reversed or
induced to backtrack. Or, as a last resort, if it would be possible
to override a veto.
   Yeutter held out hope that the plant-closings provision could
still be erased somehow and said no final conclusions should be
drawn until ``the end of the legislative day.''
   ``It's not over until it's over,'' he said.
   Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin also urged that the provision be
dropped. ``If not, I have no recourse but to recommend a veto (of
the trade bill),'' she said.
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said
it was ``a possibility'' that the provision could be removed. ``But
I know of nothing that would indicate that it's a certainty.''
   ``We have said repeatedly that we want as strong a bill as can
be enacted into law,'' said Bentsen, who is vice chairman of the
overall conference committee but not a member of the plant-closings
panel.
   Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., leaving a meeting of a different trade
bill subcommittee, said it appeared that sending the measure to the
president with the plant-closing provision in it would guarantee a
veto.
   ``Based on previous comments from people in the administration,
I would anticipate that it would,'' Jenkins said. Asked if it would
be possible to override a veto, he said, ``I would think that it
would be unlikely.''
   The chairman of the plant-closings panel, Rep. Augustus F.
Hawkins, D-Calif., indicated that he expected the provision to be
contained in the final product. He allowed critics full chance to
offer amendments but afterward rejected requests for ``continued
dialogue.''
   ``The dialogue cannot be continued indefinitely,'' Hawkins said.
   ``The president said several times, including this week, that if
the bill has mandatory notice of plant closings in it, he's going
to veto it,'' said Rep. Steve Bartlett, R-Texas, a persistent
critic of the plant-closings provision. ``Now that's not hard for
anybody to understand.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Dukakis Must Decide Whether To Confront Jackson</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis regained some of the
credibility he needed with his Connecticut presidential primary
victory, and now must decide whether to follow the example of
Albert Gore Jr. and directly challenge Jesse Jackson's
qualifications for the White House.
   With Wisconsin looming as a tense, tough battle next week and
New York only two weeks later, Dukakis' Democratic dilemma is as
simple as it is difficult.
   He could permit Jackson to run virtually unmolested and thus
risk having his painstakingly constructed effort fall apart at the
hands of a dynamic campaigner who has never held public office.
   Or, he could confront Jackson as he would any other contender
who obstructed the way to the nomination, but simultaneously risk
alienating the millions of black voters who support the civil
rights leader and are essential to a Democratic victory in the fall.
   A loss for the Massachusetts governor in next-door Connecticut
would have effectively ended his hopes of winning the nomination.
Even a close win over Jackson might have been seen by party leaders
as a sign of mortal weakness and sparked a movement to draft Mario
Cuomo _ just in time for the governor's home state New York primary
on April 19.
   Instead, Dukakis triumphed in Connecticut with 59 percent of the
vote to 28 percent for Jackson, a solid win by anybody's reckoning
_ even if it was in friendly New England _ and bought himself the
time he needs to regroup for Wisconsin.
   His aides say he will campaign energetically there, a response
to the critics who complained that he seemed to give short shrift
to Michigan. Dukakis lost by about the same margin there as he won
by in Connecticut.
   These aides also say he will set out the differences with
Jackson in Wisconsin in a way he hasn't done before.
   Dukakis no doubt wishes that someone else will do the work for
him. The media, the party leaders who fear a debacle if Jackson
heads the Democratic ticket in the fall and other politicians are
all candidates for the heavy lifting.
   Gore, in fact, stepped in even before the dimensions of Dukakis'
big win _ and his own poor, 7 percent finish _ were known from
Connecticut.
   ``We're not choosing a preacher. We're choosing a president,''
he said in New York during the day.
   Gore credited Jackson with having ``energized millions of
voters'' and having offered ideas on drugs and the economy.
   ``But I part company with him over his opposition to such
mainstays of our national defense as the F-15 and the cruise
missile,'' he said. ``I categorically reject his notion that
there's a moral equivalence between Israel and the PLO. And I am
dismayed by his embrace of (PLO leader Yasser) Arafat and (Cuban
leader Fidel) Castro.''
   Jackson, campaigning in East Harlem when told of Gore's remarks,
said, ``The senator should not discriminate against someone because
they are a preacher, a priest or a rabbi.''
   ``I assume that he is stimulated by his own status in the
campaign to attack me. I am stimulated to keep hope alive,'' he
added.
   That was Jackson's way of saying that Gore was attacking him out
of desperation. The Tennessee senator, three weeks after his strong
Super Tuesday showing, is still searching for a place to
demonstrate srtrength in the North. He has the added embarrassment
of having lost eligibility for federal campaign funds, at least
temporarily.
   Gore's attack was unprecedented in the Democratic campaign, and
in the curious language of politics, an indication of the new
stature that Jackson gained along with his Michigan caucus victory
last weekend.
   For months the white candidates have basically let Jackson alone
_ assuming he posed no threat of winning the nomination _ even as
they jabbed and poked at each other.
   Candidates generally refrain from attacking someone who isn't
getting in their way in a campaign, particularly if he has millions
of followers whose votes may be needed later.
   But when Jackson won several Super Tuesday states, followed up
with a strong second place showing in the Illinois primary on March
15 and scored his stunning victory in Michigan last weekend, he
stopped being a sideshow and became part of the main event.
   And at Dukakis' expense.
   The governor's endorsements, the organization, the fundraisers,
the solemn whispering by aides of Dukakis' inevitability all seemed
on the verge of being washed away in a Michigan landslide.
   Jackson knew exactly how to ridicule the trappings of a campaign.
   ``We don't have no Rolls Royces and no big stretch limousines on
the road to the White House,'' he said in Connecticut. ``We're
walking but we know the road better.''
   Jackson can outdo Dukakis in rhetoric at every turn.
   The governor talks of his Greek immigrant parents' journey to
success in the New World with genuine feeling. Here's what Jackson
says to his supporters, many of them struggling daily with poverty:
   ``I'm almost to the top. But I came from the bottom. I really
understand.''

   Country musicians Buck Owens and Roy Clark
will be reunited tonight as ``Ol' Pickin' and Grinnin''' for a 20th
anniversary celebration of ``Hee Haw.''
   Owens left the syndicated television show three years ago to
pursue other business interests. Clark remained as host of the
program, joined by other country music stars as co-hosts.
   ``It's great to have him (Owens) back,'' Clark said Tuesday
after appearing before the Oklahoma Senate to accept a resolution
naming March 30 as ``Hee Haw Country Music and Entertainment Day.''
   Sam Lovullo, the producer of the program, said 104 entertainers

   The two young sons of Prince Charles encountered
the likenesses of some their most violent royal ancestors during a
visit to an exhibition of horrors.
   William, 5, and Henry, 3, went on an hour-long tour of the
converted warehouse known as the London Dungeon on Tuesday
accompanied by two detectives and a governess.
   The princes saw life-size models of Charles I, who tried to rule
Parliament and was beheaded; King Henry VIII, who had two of his
six wives beheaded; and Henry's Catholic daughter Mary Tudor, who
burned her Protestant subjects at the stake.
   The boys, whose father is heir to the British throne ``seemed to
enjoy their hour or so with us,'' said the museum's promotion
manager Peter Jay.

   Anthony Andrews, the costar of a forthcoming
CBS movie about King Edward VIII's romance with a commoner, started
life poor but married well and now rubs shoulders with royalty.
   Andrews plays the English king who abdicated for love and
created a pre-World War II constitutional crisis in ``The Woman He
Loved.'' Jane Seymour portrays Wallis Simpson, the American
divorcee he married.
   Known to American viewers for his starring role in the
Masterpiece Theater series, ``Brideshead Revisited,'' Andrews grew
up in a part of London he describes as ``lower middle class and
stable working class,'' TV Guide says in its April 2 issue.
   His life took another turn when he married actress Georgina
Simpson, heiress to a department store fortune. They have a country
house in Hampshire, horses and three children.
   Despite his affection for the royal family _ Princess Anne is
godmother to his youngest child, Amy-Samantha _ Andrews is
disdainful of Edward, who later became the Duke of Windsor.
   ``It was an extraordinary thing to do _ to have decided to throw
all our heritage to the wind and upset the constitution of the
country,'' he said.

   Cable TV operator Ted Turner says his new
24-hour television network will be free of ``sleazy sex'' when it
begins operation next fall.
   ``It's a new project. That makes it kind of exciting,'' Turner
said Tuesday. ``You don't know exactly what's going to happen. It's
kind of like `Gone With the Wind,' half way through you're not sure
the South is going to lose.''
   Turner Network Television is scheduled to be offered to cable
operators on Oct. 3.
   ``We aren't going to have the tyranny of being totally dependent
on advertising revenues,'' Turner said. ``When that's the case, you
have to go for the largest audience and unfortunately the programs
have a lot of gratuitous violence or a lot of sleazy sex.''

<HEAD>Three Killed In Cuban Consulate Blaze</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three people died in a fire that heavily damaged
the Cuban Consulate on Tuesday night. Consular officials kept
firefighters away for 15 minutes while they telephoned for
permission to let them in, police said.
   The three victims _ two men and a woman _ were found in
different rooms of the top floor of the four-story, 19th century
mansion on the slopes of Mount Royal, said Raymond Therrien, a fire
director.
   He said he presumed the three, whose identities were not
available, were all consular employees and that they died of smoke
inhalation.
   Therrien said the fire was believed to have started on the top
floor, where firefighters found unrolled fire hoses. The cause of
the blaze was not known.
   Consulate officials would not let firefighters battle the fire
until about 15 minutes after they arrived, police said.
   ``They've got their own security and their own fire people
working inside,'' police Sgt. Ulrich Pilon told reporters at the
scene. ``When they saw it was out of control they let the
(firefighters) in.''
   Pilon said a security guard in a condominium across the street
had phoned to say he saw smoke coming from the consulate's attic.
   ``There were one or two fire trucks there when we arrived,''
Pilon said. ``After we talked with the consul and she checked with
her officials in Ottawa, they let the firemen in.'' The consul,
whose name was not immediately available, took up her post a week
ago.
   Therrien said about 10 people were removed from the older part
of the consulate where the fire raged, and that the fire-fighting
effort was hampered by the consulate's barred windows.
   The blaze did not reach a recently completed wing of the
building.
   The consulate is across the street from the house of former
Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and dozens of onlookers stood on his
lawn to watch the blaze.
   The delay by the Cubans is similar to an incident in January
1987 when Soviet officials kept firemen waiting for a quarter of an
hour before letting them fight a blaze that destroyed the Soviet
consulate in Montreal.
   While firemen waited perched on ladders, Soviet officials
hustled boxes of documents out the back door into parked cars.
Others inside the building tried to douse the flames with chemical
extinguishers and buckets of snow.

   Jesse Jackson drew about 20 percent of the white
vote in Connecticut but a sizable percentage of Democrats said they
would vote Republican in November if Jackson were the nominee, exit
polls showed.
   In addition, Jackson lost the support of blue-collar white
workers in Connecticut to Michael Dukakis, the polls by ABC News
and WNBC-TV said.
   ``Jackson has improved his showing with whites, but not the
working class whites he's supposedly been getting,'' said ABC poll
analyst John Brennan. ``Those have been won decisively by Mike
Dukakis.''
   Signs of Jackson's weakness in a fall campaign were also evident
in the survey findings. Thirty-three percent of Democrats told ABC
they would abandon the party and vote for George Bush if Jackson
were nominated, compared with 13 percent if Dukakis were the
nominee and 24 percent if Gore received the nomination.
   That third of the Democrats who'd vote for Bush if Jackson were
nominated include a plurality _ 45 percent _ of the Democrats who
voted for Dukakis.
   Sixty percent of the Democrats, including a third of those who
voted for Jackson, said they believe Dukakis will be the nominee,
WNBC found. Only 20 percent said they think the country is ready to
elect a black president.
   Dukakis won all demographic groups except blacks, and ABC found
that 79 percent of Democrats said they would support him against
Bush in November. Just 56 percent said they would support Sen.
Albert Gore Jr. against Bush and only 52 percent of Democrats said
they would back Jackson against Bush.
   Still, the WNBC poll found some softness in Dukakis' support: 45
percent of his voters said they wished there were other candidates
running.
   ``He's swept all groups except blacks,'' said poll chief Laurily
Epstein. ``But there's disquieting news in that it's not
enthusiastic support.''
   ABC found that Jackson did not draw a much greater share of
black voters to the process; their 8 percent of the total was up
just 1 point from 1984. And Jackson's white supporters were
primarily well-educated liberals; Dukakis, governor of neighboring
Massachusetts, won blue-collar workers by a 2-to-1 margin.
   ``He (Jackson) is increasing his white vote,'' Brennan said.
``But given the profile of his white vote it's doubtful at this
point that he is competitive.''
   Brennan noted that Jackson's share of the white vote was about
the same in Massachusetts and Rhode Island and greater in Vermont
early this month, before his victory Saturday in the Michigan
caucuses. The WNBC poll found no evidence of movement to Jackson
after his Michigan victory.
   ``There's been a misconception that Jackson has made some kind
of substantial breakthrough with the white vote,'' Brennan said.
``I don't think that's happened.'' There was no exit polling in the
Michigan caucuses, which, as is customary for caucuses, drew
relatively few voters.
   There also was a hint of potential trouble for Bush in the
general election: The 40 percent of Republicans who said he not has
told the full story of the Iran-Contra affair tended to support him
less strongly. ``Among those for whom it's an issue, it's hurting
him,'' Epstein said.
   Bush still was viewed favorably by 75 percent of the Republican
voters, and unfavorably by 18 percent, in WBNC's poll. Dukakis was
viewed favorably by 70 percent of Democrats and unfavorably by 10
percent.
   Jackson was viewed favorably by about half Democrats and
unfavorably by a third, while Gore's rating was 40 percent
favorable, a quarter unfavorable. Only one in seven Gore supporters
think he will be the party's nominee.
   The WNBC poll included 1,700 voters and had a margin of sampling
error of 3 points. ABC's poll had 1,277 voters and a 5-point error
margin.

   Arnold I. Burns, the high-ranking Justice
Department official who announced his resignation Tuesday, spent
most of his career as an attorney in New York.
   Burns, 57, had served as deputy attorney general _ the No. 2
slot at Justice _ since July 24, 1986. He had been associate
attorney general for a short while before his promotion.
   Burns was not viewed as an ideological conservative at the
department in contrast to some of the other people who worked with
Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   Perhaps the most attention Burns attracted came after the
exposure in November 1986 of the sale of weapons to Iran and the
diversion of profits to the Contras, the so-called Iran-Contra
affair.
   Burns was involved in meetings with Justice Department officials
on Nov. 25, 1986, the day Meese announced the Iran-Contra affair
publicly for the first time.
   According to a report by congressional committees that
investigated the Iran-Contra matter, Meese asked Burns to ensure
that White House officials had sealed the offices of Oliver L.
North and John M. Poindexter, two national security aides involved
in the matter.
   Burns forget to make the call and failed to reach White House
counsel Peter Wallison until Nov. 26, the report said. Wallison, it
turned out, said the documents had been secured by a security
officer.
   A native of New York, Burns graduated from Union College and
received his law degree in 1953 from Cornell University.
   Before coming to Washington, Burns was a senior partner at the
New York law firm of Burns, Summit, Roving and Feldesman, a firm
which he founded in 1960. Burns is married and has two children.

<TEXT>
   Here is a transcript of Sen. Bob Dole's
comments Tuesday as he ended his bid for the Republican
presidential nomination.
   Well, I am very honored to be here today, and I appreciate all
my _ many of my _ most all of my colleagues being here, many from
the House, and my good friend, Pat Moynihan. Pat, appreciate your
being here, too.
   And we're not going to say anything mean about anybody, so you _
it's about _ it's going to be a non-partisan statement, not going
to attack any Republicans. So in any event _
   But nearly five months ago, I went home to Russell, Kan., to
declare my candidacy for the highest office the American people can
bestow.
   It was only natural that I should begin my campaign for the
presidency on Main Street, among those from whom I have always
drawn my strength and identity.
   Today, here I am, ``bloodied but unbowed,'' as the poet says,
reminding you that there was a special reason this year for those
of us on the Republican side to walk, or in my case, to run the
extra mile.
   And that reason is the national interest.
   The nation is entering a period in which there are great dangers
and great challenges, and I entered this race convinced that to
solve our problems and realize our potential, America requires
strong leadership.
   The kind forged in the crucible of governance.
   The kind that is sensitive to how ordinary people live, and
attuned to their extraordinary possibilities.
   I ran for my party's nomination because I was determined to lead
a dialogue on issues that matter, issues that I care passionately
about, involving the national defense and fiscal integrity of this
country, profoundly interrelated issues I feared would get lost in
the shuffle.
   I wanted these issues to be a part of a crucial dialogue about
this country's future.
   It matters if we have this hostile Soviet client state the
Sandinistas are building in our own backyard.
   It matters if we have this monster deficit looming up like a
tidal wave in our future.
   And it matters how we deal with these issues, whether we
mortgage our future to them or whether we make certain that the
buck stops here, and future generations don't have to pay up
because of our cowardice.
   My campaign has been an appeal for all Republicans to recognize
and celebrate the diversity of America.
   No party can govern that is not truly representative of this
nation of nations.
   And no president can succeed who promises confidence, but
withholds compassion.
   I seek a party as strong in its commitment to equal rights as to
its military and economic pre-eminence, for the defense of American
freedom, whether at home or abroad, is ultimately indivisible. Its
success depends on a house united and leadership with the will to
win.
   Now, I know and my friends know that I am a fighter, and I don't
like to lose.
   And I make no apology for that. It's simply the way I am.
   They also know that I am an optimist.
   If I weren't, I wouldn't be standing here today.
   And I have been beaten before, and no doubt, will again.
   But I have never been defeated, and never will be, so ...
   My wife Elizabeth and my daughter Robin are beside me today, as
they have been throughout this campaign.
   We have become even closer because of this journey. And I'll
always be grateful for their love and support.
   Bill Brock, and Bob Ellsworth, and Nancy Kassebaum ... and
countless and hundreds of others _ my colleagues in the House and
the Senate; staff members; and members of the Dole For President
Committee all across America; volunteers, both here today and
across the country, have made this campaign a labor of love, and my
thanks seem hardly enough.
   More than one and a half million Americans have honored me with
their support in primaries and caucuses, and for that, I will
always be humble.
   The one thing you learn how to do pretty well in our business is
to count.
   You come to trust your instincts to tell you when it's over.
   And in my heart, I know that time is now.
   And so I congratulate George Bush, and wish him well in
November, because as I've said many, many times, the bottom line is
keeping the White House Republican; that's the bottom line.
   So today I've come to the end of one road, but the journey is
far from over.
   When people ask me why I ran for president, I will say because I
wanted to make a difference.
   And that desire will remain with me for as long as I live.
   Ronald Reagan has made an historic difference for America.
   He has set us on a renewed course to renewed prosperity, greater
security, and more hope and more opportunity for each and every
American.
   But there is much more work to do.
   So I return to the Senate as the Republican leader, eager to
engage there the issues that confront America, and ready to do all
I can to elect Republicans in November, and doing all I can for our
nominee, George Bush.
   Thank you very much.

<TEXT>
   William S. Weld, head of the Justice
Department's criminal division until his resignation Tuesday, is a
well-known figure in Massachusetts where he served as a successful
federal prosecutor.
   Weld, 42, a member of a distinguished Republican family in his
home state, spent five years as the U.S. attorney in Massachusetts
before he came to the nation's capital in 1986.
   During his tenure in Massachusetts, he led investigations that
resulted in the indictments of associates of Lyndon H. LaRouche
Jr., the political extremist. He also prosecuted money-laundering
cases against several New England banks.
   Before he moved into the criminal arena, Weld was a civil
litigator for a decade at Hill and Barlow, a Boston firm. He once
said he had a hard time getting started as a prosecutor.
   ``It took me six months to learn where the bathroom was,'' he
said.
   Weld has stellar academic and political connections. A summa cum
laude graduate of Harvard College, Weld also studied at Oxford
University in England. He received his law degree from Harvard in
1970.
   During 1974, he worked as a minority counsel for the House's
impeachment hearings during the Watergate episode.
   In 1978, he ran unsuccessfully as the GOP nominee for the
attorney general in Massachusetts.
   Weld is married to the former Susan Roosevelt, and they have
five children.

   Fresh flowers, catered refreshments, a
smiling flight attendant, a fill-up and a clean windshield _ it's
all part of the service offered by a network of ``pit stops'' for
the nation's corporate jets.
   The network, operated by Pueblo, Colo.-based Flower Aviation,
also features a mini-skirted service attendant named Tana Zipsie,
who directs the jets as they line up at Mount Vernon-Outland
Airport here.
   ``It's always fun when we get a jet in,'' said Ms. Zipsie, 20.
``It makes a person probably have a better day if they're greeted
with a smile.''
   To these corporate passengers, time is money. In 10 minutes,
Flower's ground crews can refuel a jet, restock on-board supplies,
dump the trash, vacuum the carpet and wipe the windshield, said
Stan Jones, the company's local general manager.
   Flower specializes in obscure airports, like Mount Vernon, where
amenities are scarce. The company also has flight pit stops in
Salina, Kan., and Fort Smith, Ark., and has plans for three more
Midwest bases.
   Most of the Flower flight stops are open 24 hours daily,
year-round. Mount Vernon is open from 6 a.m. to midnight.
   ``I haven't seen anybody unhappy when they left here at all,''
Jones said recently. ``That's the idea, anything they want. Treat
them like royalty.''
   When they arrive at Mount Vernon in the summer, passengers are
presented with flowers, usually fresh daisies. They're led indoors
to a plush lounge for refreshments and homemade chocolate chip
cookies.
   And if they're hungry, Flower also offers catered foods _ from
rolled slices of turkey, ham and roast beef to chilled shrimp and
crab legs.
   If pilots radio in ahead of time and mention the password,
``spin,'' they take home a bottle of champagne and a frozen steak,
said Jones, who declined to discuss his company's rates.
   ``This is a vacation for me. All the pressure is down,'' said
Gary Garrison, a corporate pilot from nearby Olney. ``It's just a
time for me to relax when the airplane is down like this.
   ``And they're very accommodating to you,'' Garrison added. ``You
can take their car and go uptown and eat if you like.''
   Some passengers, said Jones, take time to golf, fish or shop.
``We have guys that get out of the airplane and jog around the ramp
out there, in all kinds of weather.''
   Though most of their business comes from business people, Jones
said they also get celebrities, like singer Mickey Gilley and race
car driver Mario Andretti, military officers, politicians and
wealthy private parties.
   Jones said he could provide no figures on the number of daily
flights that used Flower's services at Mount Vernon, but he noted
that business picks up in the summer, with up to a dozen jets lined
up on the tarmac.

<HEAD>Diaper Wholesaler Offers To Meet Town's Needs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cloth diaper importer has offered this
town a year's worth of free diapers to show his appreciation for
the town fathers' refusing to let welfare recipients buy the
disposable kind.
   Philip D. Anderson, president of Empire Trading Co. Ltd. of
Syracuse, N.Y., said he will supply as many cotton diapers as the
town needs at no charge.
   He said his offer was prompted by a news story about the town's
Feb. 16 decision to remove disposable diapers from the list of
allowable local welfare expenses.
   Anderson said his company supplies diaper services and
mail-order houses with Chinese-made diapers designed to retain
their shape after laundering.
   The town's policy change has drawn support from
environmentalists and fiscal conservatives who agree with the
choice of traditional cloth diapers as an appropriate technology
that saves taxpayers' money.
   Critics have accused Lisbon officials of making a rash decision
to balance the budget on innocent babies' bottoms.
   In a letter to the Times Record in nearby Brunswick, Peggy
Cotton of West Bath said the restriction was ``for a baby who's
helpless'' and she suggested that town officials ``get their
savings someplace else.''
   Connie A. France, Lisbon's welfare director, recommended the
policy because throwaway diapers cost $10 a box, while cloth
diapers, even with laundering costs considered, are less of a drain
on the town's welfare budget.
   France said it would be up to the selectmen whether to accept
Anderson's offer. But, she added, ``I'm sure they will.''
   France said she had no idea how big a diaper demand there was
over a year's time but, pending the selectmen's decision, she would
order a gross of diapers from Anderson.
   The welfare director said that while the diaper rules may have
caused a stir outside Lisbon, there have been no complaints from
her clients.
   Town Manager John Bubier said Lisbon officials have received
letters and phone calls from across the country in response to the
diaper policy, with ``about 98 percent of them'' backing up the
selectmen.
   He said 200 to 300 individuals in this town of 12,000 usually
receive public assistance benefits during the course of a year. The
local welfare budget totals about $35,000.

<TEXT>
   Federal authorities charged a California
man Tuesday with intent to distribute after seizing 189 pounds of
cocaine worth more than $40 million when the car he was in was
stopped for speeding.
   Orlando Rene Monie, 33, of Los Angeles appeared in handcuffs
before a U.S. magistrate, and a bond hearing was set for Friday.
   Officials called the seizure by far the largest cocaine haul on
record in Iowa. Agents said the largest prior seizure they could
recall was a 12-pound haul in Davenport last year.
   Public Safety Commissioner Gene Shepard said two suitcases of
cocaine were found in the trunk of a car stopped for speeding
Monday afternoon near the Atlantic exit on Interstate 80.
   The trooper who pulled the car over had become suspicious and
asked to look inside the trunk, Shepard said.
   ``He saw several suitcases, one of which appeared to be leaking
a white powdered substance,'' Shepard said. The trooper called for
help, and a dog trained to detect narcotics was brought to the
scene.
   ``The dog indicated there were controlled substances in the
containers,'' Shepard said.
   Field tests concluded that the suitcases held cocaine, and Monie
was arrested along with a woman who had been driving the car and a
second woman. A 2-year-old child in the car was turned over
temporarily to county human services workers.
   The two women said they knew nothing about the suitcases in the
trunk and were later released.
   State agents said the largest prior cocaine seizure in Iowa they
could recall was a 12-pound haul in Davenport last year.

<TEXT>
   ``Oba Oba,'' with its Brazilian entertainment,
and the Black Swan Dance Company, with Brazilian dance and guest
dancer Fernando Bujones, opened in New York the same night.
   ``Oba, Oba,'' at Broadway's Ambassador Theater, looks exactly
like a show an American would expect to find at a Rio de Janeiro
nightclub catering to tourists. One would expect to be exhilarated,
and the performance here Tuesday night was surprisingly delightful.
   Costumes, dancing and musicians look like Mardi Gras on stage.
   Before Act 1 ended with a tribute to Carmen Miranda, one already
had thought of her flamboyance.
   ``Oba, Oba'' is more than cheerful. Its 50 or so performers
exude an infectious spirit of joyfulness.
   References to slaves fighting and African religions in Act 2
lead up to athletic and exotic dances, strictly entertaining, not
seriously ethnic.
   In some dances, women wore tops and dance belts _ backless
bikinis. Because their manner wasn't naughty, it seemed simply
another costume.
   Singing star Eliana Estevao has a beautiful voice.
   A limited engagement for ``Oba, Oba'' has been announced.
   At the City Center, the 10-year-old Black Swan Dance Company,
from Sao Paulo, Brazil, opened for a week.
   Guest star Fernando Bujones is still the exciting dancer with
dazzling technique he was when seen regularly here in American
Ballet Theater.
   His partner Tuesday in two pas de deux was beguiling, petite
Yoko Morishita of Hiroshima, Japan.
   The program, over-long, included two folk dance numbers, an
undistinguished pas de deux for Ana Botafogo and Laudiney Delgado,
and two unusual character ballets.
   In the first ballet, ``Who Are You?'', Vitorio Casarim, has a
dalliance in dance with a fiery woman, then with a demure one, and
winds up in a clinch with a man in a black cloak we had thought
until then was a priest.
   A more successful dance is based on Sartre's ``No Exit.'' Julio
Lopes choreographs erotic solo dancing and some nudity. Each one of
a trio condemned to share a room in hell tries to entice the one he
or she fancies, but that one always yearns for the third party.
Even a twitch from the third person can undo the seductive effect
the first person begins to have on the second.

<TEXT>
   The commander of the communist
insurgency's army was among seven rebels captured this week, the
military disclosed Wednesday.
   Romulo Kintanar, the elusive leader of the New People's Army,
was presented at a news conference held Wednesday by Maj. Gen.
Ramon Montano, chief of the Philippine Constabulary, at a heavily
guarded suburban Manila military camp.
   The seven rebels, who were arrested in a series of raids
Tuesday, also include Communist Party Secretary-General Rafael
Baylosis; Central Committee member Benjamin de Vera; and the chief
of staff and logistics officer of the New People's Army, Napoleon
Manuel.
   Of the seven rebels captured, only Baylosis did not appear at
the news conference Wednesday. Montano said Baylosis had refused to
be photographed.
   The arrest of the rebels was seen as a significant breakthrough
in the government's 19-year battle against the communist insurgency.
   President Corazon Aquino immediately hailed the arrests and
commended the armed forces chief of staff, Gen. Renato de Villa,
and other officers.
   ``The arrest of top communist leaders Rafael Baylosis, Benjamin
de Vera and several others is happy news for our country,'' Mrs.
Aquino said in a statement read by Press Secretary Teodoro Benigno.
   ``It clearly demonstrates that we have turned the tide and are
winning the war against the communist insurgency. The fact that
they were arrested on the NPA's 19th anniversary (Tuesday) attests
to the admirable performance of our armed forces of the
Philippines. I am elated and so is our citizenry.''
   The statement apparently was prepared before officials realized
that Kintanar was among those arrested in raids Tuesday in the
Manila suburb of San Juan. Officials said Kintanar initially gave
authorities a false name.
   Kintanar had long been wanted by the military.
   Besides being the alleged head of the 24,000-strong New People's
Army, he is widely believed to be the organizer of communist urban
assassination squads called Sparrow Units because of the swiftness
of their attacks.
   Kintanar organized the Sparrows, which began operations in the
southern Davao City in the early 1980s before moving out to the
Manila area and other urban centers.
   Military authorities did not mention Kintanar when they
announced the arrests Tuesday. He apparently used the alias of
Mario Asuncion because no person with such a name was among the
rebels presented to the press Wednesday.
   The others arrested were Kintanar's wife Gloria; Manuel's wife
Inez; and Marco Palo, a member of the Communist Party's liaison
committee jailed under deposed President Ferdinand Marcos. Palo was
among 500 political prisoners Mrs. Aquino released soon after
assuming power on Feb. 25, 1986.

<HEAD>US Contractors Urged to Bid on Japanese Projects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American builders are being urged to bid on
Japanese construction projects and test a settlement of the bitter
dispute over their exclusion from that country's public works boom.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and Japanese Deputy
Chief Cabinet Secretary Ichiro Ozawa on Tuesday jointly announced
the agreement resolving one of the major trade conflicts between
the two countries.
   Ozawa and the U.S. chief negotiator, deputy trade representative
Michael Smith, both urged U.S. firms to try out the new accord
admitting them to bidding on Japanese public works and
semi-official construction.
   Deputy U.S. Commerce Secretary W. Allen Moore said, ``Our side
feels fairly good about the outcome of these talks, but the real
proof of access will be in the future.''
   He said Commerce Secretary C. William Verity next week plans to
call heads of major U.S. construction companies to Washington and
``urge them to take advantage of what we sincerely believe is a
real opportunity.''
   Ozawa negotiated as a personal representative of Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita, who, he recalled, agreed with President Reagan in
January that the construction dispute could be solved amicably.
   ``It is my great pleasure to see a settlement that is amicable,
mutually satisfactory and fruitful,'' Ozawa said.
   Yeutter said he wanted to pay tribute to Takeshita and Ozawa for
their efforts. The settlement proves that through negotiation the
two countries ``can manage difficult bilateral trade disputes,'' he
said.
   Officials said the accord provides for U.S. participation in
construction of the offshore Osaka International Airport and some
other projects on which the two governments had basically agreed
last year.
   Added to it were procedures for non-discriminatory bidding on
other public works projects financed by the Japanese central
government, and a third category of local public works as well as
private projects franchised or approved by the central government.
   These include airport terminals which U.S. builders said they
have been prevented from bidding on despite an edge in experience
and competitiveness. The agreement provides for bidding credit, to
be granted for experience outside Japan.
   Officials said that besides the multibillion-dollar Osaka
airport project the agreement covers entry of U.S. builders in the
bidding on $16.9 billion worth of other specific projects.
   Officials said provisions were made for expanding the list, and
the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo or the Japanese Foreign Ministry can
request a meeting on the agreement at any time, with an overall
review set for 1990.
   Moore said the vote in Congress last year to bar Japanese
builders from U.S. projects in retaliation for the exclusion of
U.S. contractors from the Japanese market had contributed to
Wednesday's settlement. U.S. officials hope the agreement will work
and that it will not be necessary to extend the U.S. ban, he said.
   A co-author of the legislation, Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska,
said the pact ``appears to be workable'' and he hopes it turns out
to be more than ``just a box wrapped with lovely paper and ribbon.''
   ``The ultimate success of failure of this agreement will depend
on the ... follow-through by our industry and by the government and
industry in Japan,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dollar, Stocks Rally in Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar edged down after opening more than one
yen higher in Tokyo on Wednesday, while stocks extended their rally
to three days.
   The dollar began trading at 125.75 yen, up 1.38 yen from
Tuesday's close of 124.37 yen. After holding steady during the
morning, it began declining and ended trading at 125.43, up 1.06
yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues rose 366.89 points, or 1.41 percent, closing the
day at 26,319.98.
   It was the first time the index had ended trading above the
26,000-level since last October's market crash. On Tuesday, the
Nikkei gained 330.38 points.
   Traders said stock prices were boosted by the stronger dollar
and by gains on the New York and London markets on Tuesday.
   Dealers said trading on the foreign exchange market was quiet,
with many corporate customers staying on the sidelines because of
the end the Japanese fiscal year on Thursday.
   Many participants, traders said, were continuing to cover
dollar-short positions as they did on Tuesday, when the dollar
capped a 2.78-yen decline over four trading days and temporarily
touched 123.87 yen, its lowest level since the first week of
January.
   A Bank of Japan source said the dollar's recent fall ``was
triggered by speculative movements bolstered by almost groundless
factors.''
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, described
recent market intervention in support of the dollar by Japanese and
U.S. central banks as having been ``firm.''
   But many market analysts have said bullish sentiments toward the
yen remain because of healthly Japanese economic fundamentals.

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis Easy Winners In Connecticut Primary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDD EVERHART</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential contender Michael
Dukakis scored a 2-1 primary victory over Jesse Jackson in the
state next door to his own, while Republicans handed Vice President
George Bush an easy victory over Bob Dole, who quit the race before
the polls closed.
   Dukakis backers had been worried about Jackson, who gained
momentum in his decisive weekend victory over the Massachusetts
governor in the Michigan caucuses.
   Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat who endorsed
Dukakis only last week, said there had been ``a lot of anxious
moments'' in the days before the presidential primary. But, he
said: ``We've stemmed the tide.''
   The Massachusetts governor got the lift from his neighbors he
had counted on Tuesday, besting Jackson 58 percent to 28 percent,
according to final unofficial returns. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of
Tennessee lagged with 8 percent.
   ``This sends us back to Wisconsin and Colorado with a very good
boost,'' Dukakis said, looking ahead to next week's contests.
   Speaking by a telephone link to Connecticut supporters in
Hartford, Dukakis said it had been ``a wonderful night and a
wonderful victory.''
   ``You're good neighbors and good friends,'' he said.
   Dukakis walked away with 36 of the 52 Connecticut delegates up
for grabs, and Jackson took 16.
   In the GOP race, Bush had 70 percent of the vote in the state
where he grew up, to Dole's 20 percent, according to unofficial
final returns. Bush took 25 of the 35 delegates at stake, while
Dole got the other 10.
   A poll released last week, before the Michigan caucuses,
indicated Dukakis was favored by 50 percent of Democrats to 16
percent for Jackson, while 27 percent were undecided.
   Jackson had strong showings in Connecticut's cities and exit
polling by WNBC-TV in New York showed Jackson winning the votes of
one of every five white Connecticut Democrats.
   Four years ago, by comparison, Jackson got 5 percent of the
white vote. Former Hartford Mayor Thirman L. Milner, Jackson's
Connecticut chairman, said in 1984, Jackson was seen only as ``a
black voter's candidate.''
   ``That is no longer the case,'' Milner said. ``He is getting a
cross-section of Connecticut voters. I think his campaign is right
on target.''
   After the GOP returns were in, Bush called for ``a good unified
effort for the fall.''
   Bush turned his attention to the general election before the
primary results were in, since Dole dropped out while Connecticut
polls were still open.
   ``The job you all did in Connecticut got through to my
opponents,'' Bush said by telephone from Wisconsin to about 200
supporters at a Wallingford victory celebration.
   Former television evangelist Pat Robertson, who ignored
Connecticut, said Tuesday he couldn't dispute Bush's lock on the
nomination.
   Unofficial final returns showed Dukakis with 139,968 votes,
Jackson with 68,193 and Gore with 18,542 votes.
   In addition, former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart had 5,767 votes, or
2 percent; Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois had 3,136 votes, or 1
percent; former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt had 2,512 votes, or 1
percent; Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri had 1,018 votes, or 1
percent.
   Hart, Babbitt, and Gephardt have all left the Democratic
presidential race. Gephardt was the most recent dropout, abandoning
his bid on Monday.
   One percent, or 1,924 voters, chose the uncommitted line.
   The unofficial reurns showed Bush with 73,020 votes; Dole with
21,032; Robertson with 3,415, or 3 percent; and Rep. Jack Kemp of
New York with 3,375 votes, or 3 percent; and another 1 percent, or
3,200, uncommitted.
   Kemp dropped out of the GOP race earlier this month.

<HEAD>Senate Committee OKs April Fuel-Tax Exemption For Farmers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Finance Committee has agreed to
grant a fuel-tax exemption for farmers and other off-the-road
diesel users on April 1 and to make corporations foot the bill.
   However, the future of the proposed relief remained in doubt
Tuesday because the House Ways and Means Committee, which must
originate tax bills, has scheduled no action on the diesel
proposal. Backers of the legislation are holding out hope that the
House panel will approve a bill this week before adjourning for
Easter week.
   Farmers, fishermen and others who use diesel for off-the-road
business purposes traditionally have been exempt from the tax,
which finances highway construction. But under a 1987 law aimed at
preventing cheating, they must begin paying the tax on April 1 and
then apply for a refund when they file their income-tax returns
next year.
   The Finance Committee voted last week to grant these users
relief from paying the tax at all but, because of budget
restrictions, it acted to provide the exemption on Oct. 1. At the
direction of the committee, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, the
chairman, introduced an amendment Tuesday that steps up the relief
to April 1.

<HEAD>Georgetown University Settles Case With Homosexual Students</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgetown University has agreed to provide
homosexual groups with the same privileges given other campus
groups, ending an eight-year legal battle over gay rights at the
Jesuit school.
   The consent order signed Tuesday by Judge Sylvia Bacon of the
District of Columbia Superior Court, university officials and
members of gay student groups, means that Georgetown must now
provide equal treatment to gay groups.
   However the consent order includes a ruling by the District of
Columbia Court of Appeals that said Georgetown does not have to
officially recognize the organizations. For that reason, the school
said it will not appeal the order to the Supreme Court.
   Officials at the nation's oldest Catholic university had argued
that recognizing the groups would violate basic tenets of the
Catholic church, and imply endorsement of homosexual practices.
   ``This result has been a long time in coming, and it is
gratifying to have Georgetown admit that it was wrong all these
years,'' said Lorri Jean, who first brought the case as a member of
a lesbian group at Georgetown Law School in 1980. ``There's great
satisfaction that a battle begun as a first-year law student has
finally been won.''
   Bacon also put into effect an appeals court ruling that
Georgetown must also pay attorney's fees for the students, which
are ``substantially in excess of half a million dollars,''
according to attorney Richard Gross, who represented one student
group.

<HEAD>House Rejects Bill Giving States Title to Historic Shipwrecks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   States hoping to get title to abandoned
shipwrecks of historic significance lying within their waters won't
get those submerged treasures following a rejection of a House
proposal strongly opposed by sport divers and some commercial
salvage operators.
   The House defeated the measure on Tuesday, 263-139, which was
five votes short of the two-thirds majority required for passage.
The bill passed the Senate by voice vote on Dec. 19.
   Rep. Norman D. Shumway, R-Calif., complained that under the
bill, ``there is no legal, binding or enforceable way ... to ensure
that the sport divers' right to dive on these wrecks, even for
purely recreational purposes, will be protected by states.''
   Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., countered that ``its passage will
go a long way toward preserving these archaeological treasures,''
although he agreed with Shumway that the bill may discourage
private exploration for undiscovered shipwrecks.
   Without the bill, said Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., dynamiting and
other abuses by some reckless treasure hunters ``would absolutely
guarantee for future generations that these shipwrecks, these
valuable pieces of history, (would) be lost for all time.''
   Opponents complained that the bill had been brought to the floor
under parliamentary ground rules usually adopted for abbreviated
debate on non-controversial bills, with no amendments allowed.
   The bill's supporters, led by Rep. Charles E. Bennett, D-Fla.,
were expected to try to return the measure to the House floor under
different rules which would allow opponents to introduce amendments
and would require only a simple majority for passage.

   Two tour buses loaded with junior high
school students collided Tuesday night with a vehicle on the San
Mateo Bridge and at least 12 people were injured, two of them
seriously, the highway patrol said.
   Many of the youths were trapped inside the buses for nearly an
hour after the 9 p.m. accident until emergency crews cut openings
through the twisted wreckage. Other students crawled to safety
through smashed windows, Oakland television station KTVU reported.
   ``When we crashed into the other bus everybody started screaming
and crying. The driver swerved but he still hit the bus,'' said
Kristi New, 13, Modesto.
   ``I was sitting up and talking to my friend when I did a total
flip,'' said Callie Stewart, 13, of Modesto. ``Everybody was
screaming. After the bus stopped, people started hugging each other
and asking if they were OK.''
   The injured, some of them adults, were taken to St. Rose and
Eden hospitals in Alameda County, said a California Highway Patrol
dispatcher in San Francisco.
   Two people taken to St. Rose Hospital were listed in stable
condition, and two people, including the bus driver, were listed in
serious condition at Eden Hospital in Castro Valley, according to
hospital spokeswomen.
   About 70 teens were from Loma Linda and Roosevelt junior high
schools in Modesto were aboard the buses, returning from San
Francisco International Airport following a field trip to
Washington, D.C., the highway patrol said.
   The accident occurred in the eastbound lanes about two miles
west of the toll plaza, which is on the Almeda side of the 9.5-mile
bridge linking Almeda and San Mateo counties, said Lt. John Thomas
of the San Mateo bridge district.
   The bridge was closed in both directions following the accident.
   CHP officers at the scene said the buses collided and then
crashed into a center-divider after a passenger car stalled on the
bridge, which is about 20 miles south of San Francisco.

   Amateur detective work by a dealer of rare
Hebrew books who paid $60,000 for a counterfeit, 15th century
Haggadah _ the prayer book of Passover _ has led to the arrests of
two men accused of selling the document.
   ``Nobody in the world had this Haggadah except the library in
Israel so that's why I bought it,'' says Dov Berlin, a Brooklyn
dealer of rare books.
   Raphael Podde, 45, of Woodmere and Gabriel Reguer, 49, of
Anaheim, Calif., were arrested Tuesday at their homes and indicted
for allegedly selling or trying to sell counterfeit Haggadoth to
dealers, federal prosecutors said.
   The Haggadah, which recounts the story of the deliverance of the
ancient Hebrews from slavery in Egypt, is read by Jews during the
Passover holiday celebration, which begins Friday evening.
   The documents were handwritten until the invention of the
printing press in the late 1400s. Scholars believe the Haggadah was
first printed in Guadalajara, Spain, in 1482.
   The only known edition from that printing is kept at the Jewish
National and University Library in Jerusalem, authorities said.
   Berlin, with a business partner in Israel, bought what he
thought was a previously unknown copy of the Guadalajara Haggadah
for $60,000.
   In a telephone interview, Berlin said Podde offered to sell him
the rare Haggadah in the spring of 1986, saying he had inherited it
from the estate of his father.
   Berlin said he began to doubt its authenticity a few months
later after a friend told him that he had just been offered a
chance to buy a supposedly genuine Guadalajara Haggadah. So, he
went to Israel to compare it with the original.
   There, he discovered differences in markings between the two
documents and he later contacted the FBI after Podde refused to buy
back the phony Haggadah, Berlin said.
   Prosecutors said the defendants made the phony Haggadoth by
printing photocopies of the original onto paper made in the late
15th century.
   ``The only way to tell it was a counterfeit was to go to Israel
to compare it to the original,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonny
Frank.
   The indictment also accuses the defendants of selling three
pages of the six-leaf counterfeit document to another dealer for
$12,000 and unsuccessfully trying to sell two other phony Haggadoth
to two dealers for $90,000 and $100,000.
   Podde, an Italian citizen, was identified as an expert printer
and restorer of ancient Hebrew books. He and Reguer are partners in
the Pardes Rimonim Press, a company that prints and sells limited
editions of Hebrew books.
   Podde was arrested Tuesday morning at his Woodmere home, which
also is where the printing company is located. Reguer was arrested
Tuesday at his home in California.
   They were each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit
wire fraud and three counts of wire fraud. Each count carries a
maximum sentence of five years in jail and a $250,000 fine.

   A broken romance, not political
assassination, was the motive behind the shotgun killing of an
Indian judicial candidate by a Lumbee Indian who later committed
suicide, a sheriff says.
   Another Indian, Sandy Gordon Chavis, 24, was charged with
first-degree murder Tuesday as an accomplice in the slaying of
Julian Pierce, a popular, 42-year-old legal services lawyer who was
running for Superior Court judge in racially troubled Robeson
County.
   County Sheriff Hubert Stone, who had initially called Pierce's
killing an assassination, said a friend of Chavis, John Anderson
Goins, 24, had been having problems with his girlfriend, whose
mother was Pierce's fiancee.
   ``Two warrants were issued last week by the girlfriend's mother,
charging Goins with trespassing. Goins felt Pierce had something to
do with it. He got mad and he killed him,'' Stone said.
   Goins' body, with a bullet wound to the head, was found in a
closet at his father's home Tuesday by police who had a murder
warrant for his arrest. Stone called the death a suicide.
   ``I can assure the world that there was no political involvement
in the case,'' Stone said at a news conference. ``I think the
people of Robeson County will understand that it's just another
murder.''
   On the eve of Pierce's funeral today, however, some county
activists said they doubted Stone's conclusion.
   ``In light of our history here, any hasty conclusions to a
murder in Robeson County will always be highly suspect in the
community,'' said the Rev. Mac Legerton, director of the Center for
Community Action in Lumberton.
   ``You got a few who believe it's the real thing, but I don't,''
said the Rev. S.D. Lewis, assistant pastor at Hilly Branch Baptist
Church, a predominantly black church in Lumberton. ``They're trying
to pull a cover-up on us.''
   Before Tuesday's arrest, commissioners in the county of 100,000
people in southeastern North Carolina had urged the appointment of
a special prosecutor to investigate Pierce's killing because of
fears it was racially linked.
   Anger at what the Indians called corrupt local government and
entrenched racism in Robeson County boiled over Feb. 1, when two
Lumbees took hostages at The Robesonian newspaper in Lumberton, the
county seat.
   The siege ended when the governor agreed to appoint a task force
to investigate allegations that law enforcement was biased against
racial minorities.
   Indian leaders have also called for a special session of the
Legislature to change a law that would automatically hand the
judgeship over to Pierce's election opponent, District Attorney Joe
Freeman Britt, who is white.
   Gov. Jim Martin said Tuesday he would continue to investigate
the possibility of a special session. He also said he had talked
with Britt about a special prosecutor, but the district attorney
``was not prepared to do that.''
   Under state law, a special prosecutor could be appointed only if
Britt requested one from Attorney General Lacy Thornburg.
   Pierce was shot in the chest and side early Saturday morning.
Gunmen blasted through a broken window in his kitchen door and
entered the room to shoot him again in the head with a 12-gauge
shotgun, Stone said.
   Stone said Chavis said in a confession that Goins had pulled the
trigger on the pump shotgun that killed Pierce. The gun belonged to
Chavis's brother, Stone said.
   Chavis accompanied Goins, who was described as a longtime friend
of his, during the crime, Stone said.
   Neither Chavis nor Goins, a security guard in Raleigh who had
recently dropped out of North Carolina State University, had
criminal records, Stone said.

<HEAD>Agreement Reached On Cease-Fire Zones; Ortega Seeks U.S. Relations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Contra and Sandinista negotiators
agreed on the cease-fire areas where rebels will begin gathering
Friday, and President Daniel Ortega urged the United States to
discuss normalizing relations with Nicaragua.
   The negotiators identified the cease-fire zones Tuesday at the
end of two days of talks in the southern outpost of Sapoa, but
failed to resolve other crucial issues, including when the Contra
rebels will lay down their arms.
   Citing the cease-fire accord signed last week by Sandinista and
Contra rebel leaders, Ortega said in a speech Tuesday the United
States should begin negotiating a return to normal relations with
his leftist government.
   ``We hope President Reagan keeps his word. He has repeatedly
said that the day the Sandinistas sit down for direct negotiations
with the Contras, then the United States government would sit down
and negotiate with the Sandinistas.
   ``We hope he is a man of his word and immediately fulfills his
word to accept bilateral conversations to deal with security issues
that concern the United States with respect to Nicaragua and with
Nicaragua in respect to the United States,'' Ortega said. The
discussions should focus on normalizing relations, not the internal
policies of Nicaragua, he said.
   Ortega also urged the U.S. Congress not to approve more Contra
aid in violation of last week's cease-fire agreement, in which the
rebels agreed to accept only humanitarian assistance from neutral
organizations.
   House negotiators later reached agreement in principle on $50
million in non-military aid to the Contras and for children injured
in the six-year war.
   U.S. aid to the rebels expired Feb. 29 and Contra leaders say
Reagan's inability to secure them continued military aid was a
factor in their decision to sign the accord.
   After three days of talks in Sapoa last week, the Contras and
Sandinistas agreed to try to work out a lasting peace during a
60-day cease-fire that is to begin Friday. The Sandinistas also
promised to restore democracy in Nicaragua.
   A communique released Tuesday night at the end of two days of
talks in Sapoa aimed at hammering out details of the cease-fire
said the two sides had agreed on the size and location of zones
where the rebels are to gather.
   The truce and zones _ two in the north, two on the Caribbean
coast and one in the south _ were agreed to only in general terms.
The exact locations of the areas were not immediately disclosed.
   Army Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. Joaquin Cuadra, the chief
Sandinista negotiator, said that issues including what supplies the
rebels may receive and whether they must lay down their weapons
remain to be decided when the talks resume in Sapoa next week.
Under last week's Sapoa accords, the main peace talks are to begin
in Managua on April 6.
   ``We are trying to guarantee the physical and moral security of
our combatants,'' said Aristides Sanchez, head of the rebel
delegation.
   Ortega spoke on Tuesday at a ceremony honoring anti-war activist
S. Brian Willson of San Francisco as a ``hero of peace.'' Willson
lost both legs last fall when a train ran over him during a protest
at a U.S. Navy weapons depot in Concord, Calif.
   In November, Reagan said Secretary of State George P. Shultz was
prepared to meet with the Sandinistas ``once serious negotiations''
on a Nicaraguan cease-fire were under way.The United States and
Nicaragua have not held direct talks since 1984.
   For years, Ortega's government refused to meet with the Contras,
insisting instead on negotiations with the United States, while the
Reagan administration said the Sandinistas must first talk with the
Contras.
   The Sandinistas came to power in a revolution that ousted the
rightist regime of the late President Anastasio Somoza in July
1979. The United States supported the Sandinistas initially, but in
1981 began financing the Contra insurgency. The civil war has
ravaged the Nicaraguan economy, created food shortages, and
produced an unpopular military draft.

<TEXT>
   It hardly merits a mention in most
history books, but Sweden is celebrating the 350th anniversary of
its short-lived colonization of the New World and Swedes'
contribution to the American way of life.
   Marking that long-ago foothold, Sweden is putting on a traveling
show of their emigrants' contributions that range from the zipper
and Coca Cola bottle to ball bearings and monkey wrenches.
   The year-long celebration will begin with a 14-city U.S. tour in
April by King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia.
   Swedish settlers disembarked on the shores of the Delaware River
on March 29, 1638, 18 years after the Pilgrims landed farther north
at Plymouth Rock, Mass. At its peak, ``New Sweden'' had 500 people,
but within 17 years the Swedes lost their colony to the Dutch who
then lost it to the British.
   ``It's not much to celebrate. We are a peaceful people and even
then we had no knack for colonial work,'' said historian Per Sorbom
of Uppsala University.
   ``But it's a good excuse to make Sweden a little more known in
the United States and to give Sweden an identity,'' said Sorbom,
who has organized an exhibition of inventions and innovations by
Swedish emigrants.
   Sorbom's ``It's Swedish'' exhibition will open April 19 in
Chicago and move in the autumn to Los Angeles.
   About 1,000 exhibitions, music festivals, seminars and other
events are planned in the United States for the celebrations called
``New Sweden 88.''
   They include a display of the Swedish crown jewels in Washington
and tributes to Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat credited
with saving 100,000 Hungarian Jews from Nazi death camps in World
War II. Wallenberg disappeared toward the end of the war and there
are occasional reports that he is still alive in a Soviet labor
camp after being seized by advancing Soviet troops. The Soviets
insist he is dead.
   Though the Swedes' Delaware colony had little impact on American
history, it was the first page of Nordic emigration.
   In the 19th century, before Sweden became industrialized,
emigrants fled poor farmlands that could not sustain the growing
population.
   By 1900, 1 million people or one-quarter of the world's Swedish
population lived in the United States. The number of Americans of
Swedish descent has grown to 4.3 million, compared to Sweden's
population of 8.4 million.
   Among the Swedish immigrants are many whose names have been
virtually forgotten but not their contributions. They include:
   Alexander Samuelsson. A glassblower from Goteborg who emigrated
in 1883, he won a design contest for a company selling its fizzy
drink at soda fountains.
   Coca Cola wanted a bottle ``that would be recognizable even if
it was broken in the gutter,'' said Sorbom, and Samuelsson's design
is still in use.
   Justus Sjoberg. He moved to Chicago from Goteborg and changed
his name to Seeburg. He is credited with inventing the parking
meter and the jukebox.
   Gideon Sundbach. In the early 1900s he patented the modern
zipper.
   C.E. ``Measurement'' Johansson. His gauges for steelmaking
became an essential element of Henry Ford's assembly line.
   Sorbon said other displays in his exhibition range from safety
matches to heart pacemakers to the Hasselblad cameras used by
American astronauts who landed on the moon.

<TEXT>
   Former President Chun Doo-hwan's
younger brother confessed to stealing a fortune in cash, land and
stocks and will be charged with embezzling at least $9.3 million,
prosecutors announced today.
   Senior Prosecutor Kang Won-il said Chun Kyung-hwan broke down
early today after 20 hours of interrogation and admitted he
embezzled funds during his seven years as head of the semi-official
Saemaul (New Community) Movement.
   Kang said Chun, who at first denied the charges, confessed after
being shown evidence and said he used the money for land and stock
speculation.
   ``Mr. Chun has largely admitted to most of the charges after
prosecutors showed him evidence and through cross-examination,''
Kang said.
   Kang said formal corruption and embezzlement charges were being
prepared and Chun would be charged today or Thursday. If convicted,
Chun could receive punishments ranging from 10 years imprisonment
to the death sentence.
   Prosecutors said Chun still denied charges that he peddled
government influence and diverted funds overseas, according to Kang.
   Officials said he also blamed his surbordinates for taking most
of the funds missing from Saemaul, a huge nationwide organization
founded in 1971 to promote urban and rural development.
   But Kang, who has headed the investigation into Saemaul, said
there was extensive evidence implicating Chun as the key figure in
massive corruption involving embezzlement, influence peddling and
extorting stocks, land and money from businesses.
   ``My investigators have already secured enough evidence to
incriminate and prosecute Chun,'' he said.
   Prosecutors said Chun was implicated in the misappropriation of
$9.3 million. They said investigators were checking evidence Chun
embezzled another $6 million.
   The government investigation into corruption within Saemaul has
become a major political scandal. About 200 Saemaul and government
officials have been questioned about corruption or covering it up
to protect former President Chun and his family.
   Five suspects were charged with embezzlement and fraudulent land
sales Tuesday night, prosecutors said, two of them top Saemaul
officials and brothers-in-law of the younger Chun.
   One brother-in-law, Hwang Hung-sik, tried to commit suicide
twice Tuesday while in custody, once trying to jump from a
five-story window.
   Former President Chun, who has not been implicated in the
Saemaul scandal, is on a private tour of the United States and met
with President Reagan at the White House last week.
   Opposition parties are demanding the former president return to
South Korea immediately to explain his role in the Saemaul scandal.
Opposition leaders charge the former president must have been
involved in the affair.
   Prosecutors say the younger Chun, who was appointed by his
brother, used his position as Saemaul leader to divert government
and private donations, sell influence and pressured businesses to
make gifts of money, land and stocks.
   Widespread government corruption was long suspected under the
authoritarian Chun regime. But criticism of the president and his
family were not tolerated and the allegations were ignored.
   The younger Chun resigned as Saemaul chief in 1987 after being
linked to underworld gangsters. He fled to Japan April 18 when news
of the government probe surfaced, but returned two days later to
face questioning.
   President Roh Tae-woo, who took power Feb. 25, is thought to
have approved the Saemaul probe to discredit the former president
and end his predecessor's attempts to retain power and influence
within the government.
   Some Chun loyalists were purged from the governing Democratic
Justice Party earlier this month and Roh blocked the former
president's attempts to retain substantial power as a government
adviser.
   Roh, a former general who helped put Chun in power with military
backing in 1980, promised during the presidential election campaign
to root out and end official corruption.

<HEAD>Robertson Staying in the Race So His Supporters Will Stick With
The Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHESAPEAKE, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican presidential hopeful Pat
Robertson said he will remain in the race as encouragement to his
supporters to stick with the party.
   In a news conference Tuesday after Kansas Sen. Bob Dole withdrew
from the race leaving Robertson as the lone challenger to Vice
President George Bush, the former television evangelist said he
would push on for his supporters.
   ``Even though it seems obvious now that George Bush will be the
winner,'' Robertson said, ``I can't ask people who support me ...
to stay in unless I'm willing to stay in to support them.''
   The Robertson campaign has used many first-time participants in
its well-organized campaigns in caucus states.

<HEAD>Governor Denies Urging GOP to Vote Democratic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis.(AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Tommy G. Thompson says he had no
intention of urging crossover voting in Wisconsin's April 5
presidential primary when he commented about Democratic candidate
Jesse Jackson.
   But the head of the state Democratic Party says she feels the
GOP governor's remarks amounted to a ``deliberate attempt'' to
involve Republicans in the Democratic vote.
   Thompson said Tuesday that some news reports ``greatly
exaggerated'' the comments he made to reporters in his office
Monday.
   At the news conference, Thompson was asked for whom he would
vote if he were a Democrat. ``If I were a Democrat, I would vote
for Jesse Jackson,'' he replied.
   ``As I told reporters, I do not believe in the opposition
party's political philosophy, and that certainly includes that of
Jesse Jackson.
   ``I support the Republican Party ... Furthermore, I urge all
Republicans to vote Republican in the primary election.''
   Suellen Albrecht, chairman of the state Democratic Party, said
she felt Thompson, with his comments, had made ``a deliberate
attempt to involve people in the Democratic primary who shouldn't
be there.''
   Wisconsin's open primary law allows voters to choose a party
column without stating party affiliation.

<TEXT>
   Oklahoma Sen. David Boren has announced that
he is supporting Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
   The announcement came Tuesday in a statement released by Boren's
office.
   ``For our party to remain a majority party and to recapture the
White House, we must appeal to voters in the South and Southwest
and to the more moderate voters around the country who make up the
bulk of the electorate.
   ``I believe Sen. Gore is the candidate who can best appeal to
these voters,'' said Boren.
   The senior Democratic senator said he has a good working
relationship with Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., and Sen. Paul Simon,
D-Ill. But he said Gephardt's decision to drop out of the race and
Simon's struggling campaign have narrowed the Democratic race to
three men _ Gore, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Jesse
Jackson.
   ``Out of the three remaining candidates, Sen. Gore is the
candidate most attuned to our concerns in the South and Southwest.
   ``He is the candidate most committed to national security and he
is the candidate best equipped to handle international concerns,''
Boren said.

<HEAD>Republicans Told Not To Drop Emphasis On Education Improvement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>

   Indiana Republicans should fight to preserve
the school reforms of recent years and reaffirm the party's
commitment for more education improvements in the future, says a
top aide to Gov. Robert D. Orr.
   ``I think we're a party of high expectations, and I would hope
the platform statement on education has those high expectations,''
said John R. Hammond.
   Hammond, Superintendent of Public Instruction H. Dean Evans and
Indiana State Teachers Association President Damon Moore endorsed a
continuing program of education improvements during the GOP's state
platform committee's public hearing on issues Tuesday.
   Platform committee co-chairman Daniel R. Heiser, the clerk of
the state appellate courts, said he believes education improvement
will be a top priority of drafters of the 1988 campaign document,
which will be adopted at the party's state convention on June 9.
   Hammond said the Republican Party of the 1980s will be
remembered for education reform just as the GOP of the 1970s was
known for efforts to control property taxes.

<HEAD>LAPD Chief Daryl Gates Praises Jesse Jackson's Anti-Drug Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police Chief Daryl Gates says Jesse Jackson
has spoken out more aggressively against drug abuse than any other
presidential candidate.
   ``When Jackson speaks about it, it really seems to have
meaning,'' Gates said.
   The chief quipped that Jackson's anti-drug speeches sound so
similar to his that ``sometimes I think he's been copying my
speeches.''
   However, Gates, a staunch conservative, refused to say who would
get his vote, declaring that he was ``thankful for the privacy of
the voting booth.''
   Gates' comments were made Tuesday after the county Board of
Supervisors approved a motion by Supervisor Kenneth Hahn to support
the chief's proposal to create a multi-agency task force to combat
drug trafficking. Hahn has endorsed Jackson's candidacy.
   The agency would be comprised of members of the U.S. Customs
Service, the federal Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Coast
Guard, U.S. attorney's office, FBI, Federal Aviation
Administration, Immigration and Naturalization Service and the
Department of Defense.

   A woman 8{ months pregnant who
complained of being jailed in handcuffs for an outstanding minor
traffic ticket is wanted under another name on felony check fraud
charges, authorities said.
   Kimberly Taylor, 21, who complained to Edgewater police that an
officer unnecessarily took her from her home at 5:20 a.m. Saturday
for a traffic charge, is wanted under the name Kimberly Addington.
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' Mrs. Taylor said Monday, after a
visit to her doctor, who said the baby could arrive any time. ``It
was so stupid. You'd think they'd have better things to do than
bother me on a Saturday morning.''
   Edgewater Police Chief Henry Smith said the department will
continue to investigate her complaint, but noted the other warrants
raise questions about her credibility.
   A check of records showed that Taylor, under the name Kimberly
Addington, is wanted on an Arapahoe County warrant issued in
January for felony fraud by check.
   The Northglenn Police Department has a warrant for a misdemeanor
bad-check charge, and the Thornton Police Department wants
Addington for failure to appear in court on a traffic offense.
   Taylor said Tuesday she was unaware of the other warrants,
saying the charges stemmed from a case of mistaken identity.
   She conceded, however, that she once used the name Addington,
and Edgewater officials said she used it Saturday during her arrest.
   Two Northglenn officers went to Taylor's house Tuesday morning
to arrest her on a bench warrant issued March 2 for fraud by check,
but left after neighbors said she went to the hospital.
   She was back home Tuesday afternoon and still had not delivered
her baby.
   She was issued a ticket by Thornton police Feb. 26, 1987, for
driving a defective vehicle and not having a valid driver's license
or proof of insurance, an Adams County Court official said. A
warrant was issued April 3, 1987, after she failed to appear in
court March 25.

   NASA's first post-Challenger shuttle crew ``launched'' Tuesday
on the mission that ends today at 5 p.m., and almost immediately
began to confront potential problems it might face during an actual
flight.
   The most severe problem occurred nearly six minutes after the
9:09 a.m. liftoff, when one of three main engines shut down
prematurely, forcing the crew to simulate an emergency
abort-to-orbit procedure, which it did successfully.
   Later, the crew, commanded by Frederick Hauck, missed its first
opportunity about 3 p.m. to deploy their primary payload.
   Eventually, the rehearsed deployment was delayed a day when
difficulties developed with the satellite's stabilizing gyroscopes
and a booster.
   Efforts to troubleshoot on-board problems were hampered even
more when an orbiting TDRS satellite malfunctioned, forcing the
crew to communicate with mission controllers through a network of
ground stations rather than the satellite network.
   The crew is made up of Hauck, pilot Richard Covey and mission
specialists David Hilmers, George ``Pinky'' Nelson and Mike Lounge.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge threatened attorneys
in the cocaine-smuggling trial of Carlos Lehder Rivas with contempt
if they again mention the name of Panamanian Gen. Manuel Noriega.
   Noriega's name came up during the testimony of British pilot
Andrew Barnes, 32. Barnes told of having his twin-engine plane
sabotaged last year after G-2, the Panamanian secret police,
questioned him about the death of Noriega's personal pilot.
   ``We are trying one case here. Mr. Noriega will have his chance
if and when he comes to trial,'' U.S. District Judge Howell W.
Melton admonished Attorney Robert W. Merkle and defense attorney
Jose Quinon.
   Lehder, 38, is on trial on charges that he conspired with a
group of Jacksonville smugglers to import some 3.3 tons of cocaine
into the United States from Colombia via Norman's Cay in the
Bahamas from 1978 to 1980.
   Noriega's name came up after Barnes mentioned the Panamanian
strongman in a letter he wrote last month to Lehder. ``This whole
thing has to do with Noriega's indictment in the middle district of
Florida,'' he said.
   Noriega is under indictment on drug smuggling charges in both
Miami and Tampa.
   After the slaying last year in Colombia, Barnes said he was
detained and questioned for two days in Panama by G-2 about the
killing allegedly carried out by the Medellin cartel. The
government alleges Lehder is one of the cartel's leaders.
   ``The suggestion was that the people I worked for had murdered
the pilot. ... It was not true,'' Barnes said.
   Merkle said he did not contend Lehder was involved in the
killing. Merkle said Noriega's pilot was killed because he had
stolen cocaine while flying drugs for both the Panamanian leader
and the Medellin cartel.
   Following his detention, Barnes was ordered out of the country
and left aboard his private twin-engine plane. About an hour over
the ocean, one of his engines went out, and then the other started
failing.
   With the jury out of the room, Merkle said, ``G-2 removed the
backs of the magnetos in his engines and tried to kill him, plain
and simple.''
   Barnes has pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy to import
cocaine and faces a maximum seven-year sentence.
   Although Barnes testified that he flew some 3,000 kilograms for
Lehder in 1978 and 1980, he admitted under cross-examination that
he was not aware of any of the drug flights listed in the
indictment under which Lehder is being prosecuted.
   Lehder is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with
intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a
continuing criminal enterprise.
   Co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed, 57, of San Pedro, Calif., is
charged only with taking part in a smuggling conspiracy.

   Scattered showers and thunderstorms dampened a broad area from
the Great Lakes to the lower Mississippi Valley today after 50-mph
winds toppled a tree into a Louisiana mobile home, killing a
2-year-old boy.
   Snow fell on northern Illinois, parts of Wisconsin, southeast
Idaho and northwest Wyoming. One to 3 inches of snow was reported
in southeast Wisconsin, and up to 2 inches at Rockford, Ill., late
Tuesday.
   The heaviest rainstorms were moving from western Alabama into
southeast Louisiana on the heels of showers and thunderstorms that
struck Louisiana on Tuesday afternoon and evening with high winds
and a tornado.
   The winds knocked a large tree into a mobile home near Bastrop
in northeast Louisiana, pinning 2-year-old Orlando White and his
3-year-old sister, Shahonda, in a recliner chair, said Police Chief
Stan Neathery.
   Orlando died at a hospital, Neathery said. Shahonda was treated
for leg injuries and released.
   The tornado touched down in central Louisiana, near Bunkie,
destroying two brick homes and injuring a 76-year-old woman.
   ``Things were hitting me from every side,'' said Ethel
Middlebrooks, treated for cuts and bruises at a hospital. ``I said,
`Thank you, Lord.' He could have taken me, but he must have
something planned for me.''
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
southern and eastern Texas to the lower Mississippi Valley,
Alabama, Tennessee, the upper Ohio Valley, and the Appalachian
Mountains; snow showers over the northern and central Rockies and
the northern High Plains; scattered rain showers in the Northwest,
with snow showers in higher elevations and strong, gusty winds
across much of the nation's southwest quarter.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 50s or 60s in much
of the nation; the 30s or 40s in the Northwest to the northern and
central Rockies, the northern Plains and the upper Great Lakes; the
70s in east Tennessee and West Virginia and the 70s and low 80s
from Southern California to southwest Texas and in much of the
central Gulf Coast states and southern half of the Atlantic Coast.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 6
degrees at West Yellowstone, Wyo., to 75 degrees at Key West, Fla.

   A man who helped organize a citizens'
revolt against drug dealing in his neighborhood says he and his
family are being chased out of town by drug traffickers because he
dared to speak out.
   Rick Hargraves said Tuesday he decided to speed up his previous
plans to move after he was threatened with a pistol outside his
home this week.
   ``They really don't scare me. ... I'm worried about my wife and
kids,'' said Hargraves, an unemployed mechanic who has owned a
house on Yakima's once-quiet South Naches Avenue for six years.
   The family's plight illustrates the rising frustrations of
residents on the city's East Side, who are faced with discarded
hypodermic syringes on lawns, open drug dealing on sidewalks, and
violence in the alleys.
   Central Washington is a drug hotbed, with cocaine and heroin
carried north from Mexico by people posing as migrant farmworkers,
officials say. The influence of drugs has sent the Yakima County
crime rate, particularly murder and burglary, skyrocketing.
   ``Drugs are a very serious problem over here. It far exceeds
what I thought I would get into when I got here'' a year ago, said
Robert Dreisbach, head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
office in Yakima.
   The local DEA task force, in place just over a year, has made 99
arrests, many of them upper echelon dealers and suppliers, he said.
   ``This used to be a beautiful neighborhood,'' said Teresa
Ocampo, Hargraves' neighbor and like him a member of the
two-week-old South Naches Cleanup Committee. ``Now kids go outside
to play and find syringes and put them in their mouth.''
   While many committee members have preferred anonymity,
Hargraves, an unemployed mechanic, was outspoken.
   He talked with reporters about the committee's effort to record
license plates of suspicious vehicles, and the anger of homeowners
at seeing their values decreasing.
   On Monday, while Hargraves and his wife, Jill, were standing
outside their house talking with a television reporter, a vehicle
pulled up to the curb and the passenger rolled down the window,
Hargraves said.
   The driver leaned over, pointed a gun at them, made three sounds
like shots being fired, and then drove away, he said. Police
arrested two men a short time later, but Hargraves said things have
gone too far.
   The family purchased a house outside of town about two months
ago, intending to leave the neighborhood as soon as they sold their
present home. Mrs. Hargraves said they hadn't wanted to leave
before then for fear drug dealers would take over the empty house.
   After Monday's incident, however, they decided to move out right
away and found a friend who was willing to live there.
   ``If she minds her own business they're not going to bother
her,'' Mrs. Hargraves said. ``We were fine until we started
fighting back.''
   Police Chief Pleas Green said Hargraves made the mistake of
becoming a focal point in the anti-drug efforts, especially through
media interviews and photographs.
   The average citizen is not equipped to fight drug dealers,
Dreisbach said.
   ``In this area most of the drug traffickers are armed with
loaded automatic and semi-automatic weapons,'' he said. ``The
number of drug-related homicides and assaults shows they do use
them periodically.''

<TEXT>
   A custody fight over an Indian child found eating
garbage after she was abandoned by her mother pits Illinois courts
against the tribal legal system, which her attorney fears will take
her from her foster parents.
   The girl, 6-year-old Eleanor Armell, has nightmares over the
possibility of being taken from the custody of her foster family,
``the only parents she has ever known,'' said her attorney, Cook
County Public Guardian Patrick Murphy.
   But Diane La Plante, an attorney for the tribe, the Potawatmis,
said Tuesday that the tribal system is where the case belongs.
   ``It is entirely possible'' the tribal court would rule the girl
should remain with her foster family, she said.
   The Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 gives tribal courts
jurisdiction in custody cases involving Indian children. Its aim is
``to stop the erosion of the American Indian family and to protect
American Indian children,'' Ms. La Plante said after Juvenile Court
Judge Claude Whitaker delayed ruling on a motion by Murphy.
   Murphy asked the judge Tuesday to postpone enforcement of his
March 18 ruling to transfer the case to the tribal court of the
Potawatami Indian Reservation in Mayetta, Kan.
   Murphy sought the delay while he is appealing the ruling, but
Whitaker said he would not consider the request until today because
Murphy failed to give Ms. LaPlante adequate notice of his motion.
   ``This involves a very real little girl ... having nightmares
and getting sick'' out of fear that she will be taken from her
foster parents, Murphy told the judge.
   Lorraine Swett, the girl's foster mother, had planned to testify
Tuesday and wept after Whitaker delayed action in the case.
   ``If possible, I want her to stay with me. I've had her for
three years, she's just like my own,'' Mrs. Swett said outside the
courtroom.
   Mrs. Swett, 46, is a Menominee Indian. She and her husband,
Paul, a U.S. Navy officer, have four children of their own. They
moved to Novato, Calif., from the Chicago area a year ago and
Eleanor was allowed to go with them.
   ``I want what's best for Eleanor. She's been saying she wants to
stay with me,'' Mrs. Swett said.
   Eleanor, who was not in court, was found eating garbage in a
Chicago alley in April 1985. She was suffering from tuberculosis
and lice and had been abandoned by her natural mother, Michelle
Pawless, Murphy contends.
   Ms. LaPlante said the tribe was slow to become involved because
Murphy's office did not notify the tribe of the case, as required
by law. But Murphy contends Ms. Pawless did not tell his office
that she was a Potawatami until late last year.
   The girl's father, a Winnebago Indian, died in a 1985 car
accident, Murphy said.
   The Winnebagos were the first to seek jurisdiction over the
case, but her mother objected. Ms. Pawless relented in October when
her own tribe moved to take over the case.

<TEXT>
   An ex-Conrail engineer sentenced to five
years in prison for causing 16 deaths in Amtrak's worst accident
might not have been high on marijuana at the time, but deserves the
maximum punishment, his judge said.
   Rick L. Gates, 33, of Essex, Md., deserved the sentence for
causing the ``indescribable tragedy'' that killed 16 people Jan. 4,
1987 near Chase, Md., Baltimore County Circuit Judge Joseph P.
Murphy said Tuesday.
   ``He is fortunate that I am powerless to increase the
sentence,'' Murphy said in sentencing Gates to five years and a
$1,000 fine on one misdemeanor manslaughter count to which Gates
pleaded guilty Feb. 16. under a plea bargain. Gates admitted in a
statement of facts to smoking marijuana on the train and failing to
make several safety checks that might have prevented him driving
the three linked engines into the path of the Amtrak passenger
train.
   ``I don't think any fair analysis can really result in the
conclusion that he was stoned on marijuana at the time,'' Murphy
said. ``But what he did in terms of failure to follow procedures
was to show us that he didn't give a damn. He just didn't care.''
   In the plea bargain, the 16 original misdemeanor charges of
manslaughter by locomotive were consolidated into a single charge.
The move reduced Gates' possible prison time from 80 years to five
years.
   ``I would like you to know I accept full responsibility. I will
never be able to forget,'' said Gates, who wept along with
relatives of the dead as excerpts of five victim impact statements
were read into the record.
   ``The violent death of our daughter Ceres is the most terrible
event experienced by our family,'' Dr. Roger Horn wrote. ``Our
hearts were crushed along with hers.''
   Gates was taken into custody immediately after sentencing. He
could be eligible for parole after serving about 18 months, said
Sandra O'Connor, the chief prosecutor and Baltimore County State's
Attorney.
   Donna Shearer, Gates' public defender, said he has not had a
drink since undergoing treatment and has tried to help other
alcoholics. ``He's leaning toward becoming an alcoholism
counselor,'' Ms. Shearer said, who asked the judge for a two-year
prison term, plus mandatory rehabilitation.
   Ms. Shearer said she was disappointed in the sentence but
doubted that an appeal would be filed.
   More than 175 people were injured in the crash when Gates missed
a track signal and drove three linked Conrail locomotives in front
of the 660-passenger Amtrak train traveling about 120 mph.
   Mrs. O'Connor said prosecutors decided to accept the plea after
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against post-crash drug
testing in January. The plea bargain was announced as jury
selection was scheduled to begin.
   Blood samples from Gates and brakeman Edward Cromwell tested
positive for drug use. Gates was unhurt in the crash and Cromwell,
who was granted immunity from prosecution, suffered a broken leg.
   A National Transportation Safety Board report blamed the
accident on Gates' drug use and the absence of automatic emergency
brakes on Conrail engines.
   Murphy, asked by prosecutors' that the sentence be used to send
a message to other transporation workers, said, ``No matter what I
do, we are at the mercy of people who will simply not behave
properly behind the wheel of an automobile or at the stick of an
airplane.
   ``There's nothing I can do that will deter those people. ...
Evil will always be with us.''

<TEXT>
   Two buses loaded with teen-agers
returning from a visit to the nation's capital collided on a bridge
that crosses San Francisco Bay, injuring at least 20 people and
closing the span for more than two hours.
   The accident Tuesday night began when a car with a flat tire
stopped in the fast lane of the 9{-mile-long San Mateo Bridge, said
California Highway Patrol investigator Nick Chouprov.
   The buses carried 72 youngsters from Modesto junior high
schools. The first stopped and was struck from behind by the
second, according to Chouprov.
   The youngsters suffered only minor injuries, according to Thomas
McGarry, a spokesman for Eden Hospital in Castro Valley.
   The most seriously injured was bus driver Charles Ford, 60, of
Oakland who was in serious condition with stomach injuries, he
said. ``It took 20 minutes to get him out of the bus,'' McGarry
said.
   The driver of the car that stopped for the flat, Xiaoyun Zhou,
38, of Hayward, was in serious condition with head injuries.
   The teen-agers from La Loma and Roosevelt junior high schools
were en route home from San Francisco International Airport, where
they had returned from a field trip to Washington D.C.
   ``When we crashed into the other bus everybody started screaming
and crying. The driver swerved but he still hit the bus,'' said
Kristi New, 13, of Roosevelt.
   Callie Stewart, 13, also of Roosevelt, said she flipped over a
seat during the accident.
   ``I was sitting up and talking to my friend when I did a total
flip,'' she said. ``Everybody was screaming. After the bus stopped,
people started hugging each other and asking if they were OK.''
   Some of the youngsters said police officers and paramedics got
them out through the windows of the vehicles.
   Three students who suffered minor injuries were treated and
released at Eden, said McGarry. The most seriously injured was Todd
Johnson, 12, who had a fractured arm.
   St. Rose Hospital treated seven youngsters, including two
students with minor nose injuries, said spokeswoman Debbie
Bartling. Ten other students were treated at hospitals for minor
injuries, McGarry said.
   The bridge that links San Mateo and Hayward is about 20 miles
south of San Francisco.

<HEAD>Roberts Launches New Money Drive with No Warning He'll Be Called
`Home'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TULSA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   TV evangelist Oral Roberts said he will ask
followers to donate another $8 million for his troubled medical
school, but he did not repeat last year's warning that God would
call him ``home'' if the drive failed.
   Roberts, in a taped appearence Tuesday on his son's program,
``Richard Roberts Live,'' said he would reinstate the medical
missionary program that the university canceled two months ago for
lack of funds.
   ``Now, by faith ... we will undertake a second year of
scholarship. You heard me say it the way I said it, by faith, we
will go for a second year,'' Roberts said on the program, which was
to be broadcast today.
   The evangelist agreed with his wife when she said their ``faith
wavered a little'' when they announced cancellation of the
scholarship program.
   The scholarships are provided to the students, who in return
work in Third World countries after graduation for several years as
part of the Roberts ministry.
   In 1986, Roberts announced the drive to raise by March 1987 the
$8 million needed to fund the scholarships and the medical school,
saying he wanted his students to concentrate on their education
without worrying about tuition.
   In announcing that fund-raiser, Roberts said God told him, ``I
want you to get this going in one year or I will call you home.''
   On Tuesday, Roberts and his wife Evelyn spoke via satellite from
Anaheim, Calif., to a gathering of students, faculty members and
university trustees in Tulsa. The exchange was recorded for use on
his son's program.
   The taped segment included statements from the chief financial
officer of the university, and from auditor firms who said the $8
million raised last year was used to underwrite the total costs of
the medical school for one year.
   Medical students appeared confused when Roberts made the
announcement to reinstate the program. Mark Claussen, president of
the junior class at the Oral Roberts University medical school,
spoke out.
   ``I just want this to be clear, President Roberts. Two months
ago, all of the students here were directly told that all money
would be discontinued in May,'' Claussen said.
   ``You fine young men and women ... have come face to face with
the heart of Christianity, living by faith,'' Roberts responded.
``I've got no guarantees of what will happen in the future, as we
try to serve our Heavenly Father.''
   Mrs. Roberts interrupted her husband and said, ``Two or three
months ago, our faith wavered a little and that's what the
confusion is.''

   A girl in Tawana Brawley's school claimed 18
months ago that she had been abducted and sexually abused in a
manner markedly similar to the details of Miss Brawley's story,
according to a report published today.
   The teen-ager, who knew Miss Brawley, reported that she was
grabbed by men in a green car and driven to a wooded area where she
was sexually assaulted, according to a report in today's Daily
News, citing unidentified law enforcement sources.
   Police in Poughkeepsie investigating that case found that the
charges were unfounded and that the girl had made up the story
apparently to cover sexual abuse committed by a male relative.
   Details of the 1986 incident have been turned over to the task
force working on the Brawley case under the direction of Attorney
General Robert Abrams.
   Poughkeepsie police turned over the files after the earlier case
was brought up by an anonymous caller on a local talk radio
program, the report said.
   Investigators are trying to determine whether the other student
discussed the case with Miss Brawley as late as Nov. 23, the day
before Miss Brawley, who was then 15, claims she was abducted.
   Miss Brawley has said she was abducted Nov. 24 in a green or
blue car, taken to a wooded area and then sexually assaulted by at
least six white men, including one who flashed a police-type badge.
   She was found after four days near her Dutchess County home,
covered with animal feces and with racial epithets scrawled on her
body.
   Abrams spokesman Timothy Gilles refused to comment on the News
report.

<HEAD>Walkout Cripples Factories In Protest In Southern Republic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials appealed to workers to end a walkout
that has shut or crippled factories in a disputed southern region,
but many pledged to stay home until the government bends to their
demands, reports said today.
   ``People are sitting home, home, home, without noise and without
demonstrations,'' a resident of Stepanakert, the main city of the
disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, said in a telephone interview
today.
   A bread factory, stores, medical institutions and other
essential services were operating, but many factories still were
shut down, said the man who answered the telephone at the official
newspaper Sovietsky Karabakh.
   ``People say they are going to stay away until they get a
decision from the government in their favor,'' said the man, who
said he was not a journalist but refused to give further
information about himself.
   He said he could not estimate the number of people who were
staying away from work. Reports in the official press provided
information about the situation earlier in the week.
   Constant appeals by authorities to get people to return to work
received mixed results, said reports in the newspapers, which in
recent days have been providing wide coverage to the walkout.
   Newspaper reports said 120 of about 1,500 people showed up for
work at a shoe factory Monday morning, an insufficient number to
run the plant.
   ``We're only two or three steps from catastrophe,'' plant
director Vasily Atadzhanyan told the labor newspaper Trud. ``We
will pay huge fines for not fulfilling our obligations to our
customers. We say directly: not coming to work is sabotage.''
   Officials have warned that workers who stay away from their jobs
are hurting themselves and will not convince government and
Communist Party authorities to take the predominantly Armenian
region away from the Azerbaijan republic and annex it to
neighboring Armenia.
   Instead, authorities have unveiled a plan to spend up to $640
million to improve social and economic conditions in
Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Trud said people in Stepanakert are grateful for the
government's efforts, but that some still believed it was necessary
to stay away from work to press their demand to transfer control of
Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia.
   Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, said many residents of
Stepanakert also were upset about coverage of the unrest by the
official press.
   The newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya said about 100 specialists and
workers appeared for work at an electrical-technical factory
Tuesday morning.
   ``Yesterday we held yet another meeting, and again Communists
voted to go to work,'' plant director B. Arushanyan said. ``The
first results, however, are not great. But all the same we've
started to work and this number will provide an example for
others.''
   Ninety percent of the workers at a plant manufacturing
construction materials appeared at work Monday morning, only to
walk out en masse, the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda said.
   Sovietsky Karabakh published an appeal in today's edition from
the city Communist Party urging workers to go back to their jobs,
said the man who answered the telephone at the newspaper. He
declined to read it over the telephone.
   A woman who answered the telephone at city Communist Party
headquarters refused to answer questions, saying she only answered
to higher party authorities.
   About three-quarters of Nagorno-Karabakh's people are ethnic
Armenians. Azerbaijanis, who are predominantly Moslems, and
Armenians, who are mostly Christians, have long been rivals.
   Armenians began mass protests in February demanding that
Nagorno-Karabakh be turned over to Armenia. On Feb. 28, ethnic
rioting broke out in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait, and officials
said 26 Armenians and six Azerbaijanis were killed.
   Official reports said Tuesday that a curfew in Sumgait had been
lifted, and that the city was returning to normal.

<HEAD>Alcoholics Support Group Rejects Commission's Prohibitions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOLLAND, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A support group for recovering alcoholics
will look elsewhere for a new home after township officials tacked
nearly two dozen restrictions on the use of an abandoned
schoolhouse the group planned to buy.
   The Parkship Township Planning Commission's special-use permit
would have barred more than 35 cars on the site, forbade its
occupants from gathering outside and banned alcoholic beverages and
``mood altering substances.''
   The support group, the Holland Alano Association, ``finds it
impossible to purchase the Ventura School because of the onerous
and unfair restrictions placed on the use of the premises,'' Donald
Hann, Alano communications secretary, read from a statement after
the association's meeting Tuesday.
   The rules were imposed Monday night by the Ottawa County
township's planning commission on a special-use permit sought by
the association, which had planned to buy the $59,500 building in a
rural area north of here.
   The restrictions were approved after several homeowners voiced
opposition, contending that the presence of the organization would
destroy the peaceful character of the neighborhood.
   Hann said the two stipulations that most bothered the
association were the ones that prohibited members from using the
four acres on which the schoolhouse sits, as well as the one
limiting cars in the parking lot.
   ``We cannot and we will not turn away people seeking help
because they happen to arrive in the 36th car,'' said Hann, whose
association provides a meeting place for 31 weekly meetings
totaling from 250 to 300 people.
   Regarding a restriction against gathering outside, Hann said,
``It is highly unusual that owners of property can't walk about
their own property,'' and added that under the restrictions,
neighbors would have full use of the grounds, which includes soccer
and softball fields and a playground.
   John Horsting, chairman of the ad hoc committee formed by the
commission to propose the restrictions, said the committee's
decision was a tough one.
   ``The restrictions were very seriously addressed,'' said
Horsting. ``Our first responsibility is to the township and to the
people of the township.''
   He declined further comment.
   Hann said the Alano Association, which provides a meeting site
for six alcohol groups, including Alcoholics Anonymous and Al-Anon,
will bgin searching for a new building immediately. Its lease on a
decaying warehouse expires May 1.
   ``If we don't find a place by that time, we lock our doors,''
Hann said. ``We thought an abandoned schoolhouse in the country
would be ideal for us, but I guess we were wrong.''

   If you've ever dreamed of making it on to the
cover of a Wheaties box, dream no more.
   General Mills Inc., the maker of the ``Breakfast of Champions,''
is inviting everyone to appear on a Wheaties box. But unlike recent
box subjects like Walter Payton and the Minnesota Twins, the public
will have to pay.
   The promotion, beginning next week, offers individualized
Wheaties boxes for $18.95 and proof of purchase. Eight weeks after
sending in the money and a black-and-white picture, people will
receive a single, acrylic-sealed box with their picture on the
cover, the company says.
   ``Customers have been writing letters to us for many, many years
wondering how they could get their picture on the Wheaties box,''
General Mills spokeswoman Kathryn Newton said.
   The boxes also are offered for $13.95 and five proof-of-purchase
coupons.

   A proposal to make the cranberry muffin the
official state muffin wasn't a half-baked idea and didn't deserve
to get jokingly panned by the Legislature last weekend, Elaine
Tabor says.
   It was Ms. Tabor's class at Washington Elementary School in
Merrill that initiated the drive last year to give the cranberry
muffin official status.
   The proposal was still pending when Assembly Speaker Thomas
Loftus decided to adjourn the Democratic-controlled Assembly late
Friday night before the Senate could finish work o the 1988-89
state budget.
   Loftus said his action was in part because the Senate was
spending its time discussing whether the cranberry muffin should be
the state's official muffin.
   ``They (the Senate) sent us the cranberry muffin bill at 11:30
p.m. and I think we snapped,'' Loftus said.
   The senators had added a mocking amendment that would have
established the Egg McMuffin as the official state breakfast and
the ragamuffin as the state's official child muffin.
   Senators passed that version on a voice vote and shipped it back
to the Assembly. The bill died.
   But Ms. Tabor said the situation wasn't funny for the children
in her second-grade class last year.
   ``We were studying Wisconsin and had visited a cranberry marsh
about eight miles from here,'' Ms. Tabor said Monday. ``We read
about some students in Massachussetts who had done the same thing
for the corn muffin. I know it's a frivolous thing, but it's not
frivolous to the children.''

   A Latin American organization
condemned U.S. economic pressure on Panama as outside interference,
but also called on Panama to adopt democratic reforms and hold
elections.
   The 26-nation Latin American Economic System, based in Caracas
and created 12 years ago as a forum for Latin American countries,
ended an extraordinary two-day meeting on Tuesday which had been
requested by Panama.
   It said the U.S. economic measures violated international law
and the charters of the United Nations and the Organization of
American States.
   The Reagan administration has imposed economic sanctions on
Panama and made it clear that it wants Panama's strongman, Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, ousted as leader of that nation's military,
known as the Defense Forces.
   Noriega has been indicted in the United States on charges of
drug smuggling and money-laundering, charges that he denies.
   Washington still recognizes Eric Arturo Delvalle as president of
Panama, though Delvalle was stripped of his office by the
Noriega-dominated legislature after trying to fire Noriega.
   Foreign Minister Allan Wagner of Peru told the assemblage
Tuesday, ``We have not come to defend a regime, or even less a
person who has been insubordinate to civil and constitutional
authority.
   ``Our solidarity is with the people of Panama.''
   Wagner called for an end to Panama's political crisis ``through
free elections and the removal of any obstacles that prevent this
clear expression of the will of the people of Panama.''
   The Latin American Economic System noted that Foreign Minister
Jorge Abadia Arias of Panama promised the conference Panama would
``deepen its democratic system.'' The Economic System said a
request for economic aid by Panama will be considered ``with a
spirit of solidarity'' by the organization's members.
   The nations said they opposed foreign intervention in Panama and
asked the United States to honor a treaty which turns full control
of the Panama Canal over to Panama in 1999.
   ``We urge the U.S. government to revoke immediately the coercive
measures it has adopted against Panama,'' they said in their final
communique Tuesday.
   ``We reaffirm the sovereign right of all nations to decide their
own economic, social and political destiny in peace and liberty,
free from foreign pressure, aggression and threats.''

<HEAD>Two Black Communities Claim Victories Over Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two black communities are
claiming victories after lengthy battles against the government,
which had sought to relocate one group and change the political
status of the other.
   In one case, an appeals court ruled Tuesday that the government
did not have the authority to incorporate the 120,000-member black
community of Moutse into a homeland dominated by a different tribe.
   Also, the government said late Monday it will not attempt to
relocate the remaining 8,000 residents of Oukasie, a township 30
miles west of Pretoria.
   In the Moutse case, the four-judge panel ruled that President
P.W. Botha exceeded his powers by incorporating the community into
the KwaNdebele homeland on Jan. 1, 1986. The court said the action
was taken for ``administrative convenience'' rather than in the
interest of Moutse residents.
   Most Moutse residents belong to the North Sotho tribe, and they
argued that their language and culture differed sharply from the
Ndebeles, who make up most of KwaNdebele's 400,000 residents.
   Moutse, located northwest of Pretoria, previously was part of
the Lebowa homeland. But the white-led government excised Moutse
from Lebowa when it incorporated the community into KwaNdebele.
   Dozens of people were killed in the unrest that followed. Moutse
residents staged frequent protests, and battled both local police
and vigilantes from the KwaNdebele government.
   Moutse, at least for the time being, does not belong to any
homeland. It is a 171-square-mile region that adjoins KwaNdebele,
an impoverished, undeveloped homeland where many of the workers
ride buses for up to eight hours a day, commuting to and from jobs
in Pretoria.
   Meanwhile, Minister of Constitutional Developlment Chris Heunis
told Parliament on Monday that the government would no longer try
to relocate Oukasie residents to Lethlabile, 12 miles away.
   Heunis abolished Oukasie by decree in October 1986, but only
about 5,000 of the 13,000 residents moved to Lethlabile, a newly
established township with some upgraded facilities. Most Oukasie
residents preferred their old home, where they could walk to their
jobs in the white town of Brits.
   About 8,000 residents have stayed even though the government at
various times cut off the water supply, stopped garbage collection,
tore down the school and halted bus service in an effort to make
residents leave.
   The government also sent in bulldozers to destroy houses of
people that moved from Oukasie. The town has been run largely by
community organizations for the past 18 months.
   The government's apartheid policy establishes a racially
segregated society in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have
no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the
economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health
services.

   A 20-year-old journalism major who is a

president at the University of Massachusetts.
   Certification of the March 15 election comes before the student
senate tonight.
   Jason Rabinowitz of the Bronx, N.Y., was elected president along
with a non-communist co-candidate, Shari Silkof, 20.
   Conservative opponents said the election should not be certified
because of a constitutional prohibition against co-candidacies for
president. But Rabinowitz and Silkoff said they have enough support
to turn back the challenge.
   The winners said they built a coalition of minorities, gays,
lesbians, radicals and women to defeat conservative and moderate
opponents. They said communism was not part of the platform, but
acknowledged that students were aware of Rabinowitz's affiliation.
   Opponents said Rabinowitz was elected because of student apathy
_ about 3,000 of 19,000 students voted.

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
expressed concern over ``the deteriorating situation'' in Israel's
occupied territories and the Security Council scheduled an urgent
meeting on the crisis.
   The 15-member council agreed to hold the meeting today at the
request of Arab nations who said it was necessitated by increasing
repression of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Today is Palestinian Land Day, a traditional day of nationalist
protest, and Israel on Tuesday sealed off its occupied lands
territories for at least three days to gird against unrest.
   Arab foreign ministers and the Palestine Liberation Organization
also asked Perez de Cuellar on Tuesday to send a new fact-finding
mission to the occupied lands and disseminate U.N. information
gathered there while journalists are barred.
   The U.N. chief later issued a statement expressing ``acute
concern about the deteriorating situation in the occupied
territories and especially the continued killing and wounding of
unarmed civilians.''
   He said he was ``particularly disturbed by recent press reports
of statements in Israel to the effect that the problem in the
occupied territories will be resolved by force.''
   He said such a policy ``can only lead to further violence.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was quoted as saying Monday, ``If
the Arabs of Israel won't come to their senses, reality will be
harder and laden with impending disaster.''
   Perez de Cuellar said a political solution could be found only
through an international peace conference with the participation of
the parties directly concerned and the five permanent members of
the Security Council _ the United States, the Soviet Union, China,
Britain and France.
   The Security Council has repeatedly condemned Israel's harsh
measures to put down the protests that began Dec. 8 in the
territories taken from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.

Healthy</HEAD>

   Naples, a 600-pound manatee, made veterinary
history and got a clean bill of health when a portable
electrocardiogram machine and a cellular telephone showed her heart
to be sound.
   Tuesday was the first time transtelephonic electrocardiography
had been attempted on a manatee. The use of a cellular phone
greatly simplified the procedure, according to Seaquarium spokesman
Walt Robshaw.
   ``Otherwise, we would have to hire a crane, put her in a sling
and take her out of the tank,'' he said.
   Dr. Gregory Bossart, a Seaquarium veterinarian, lowered the
water level in the pool, rolled Naples over on her back and put the
machine on her chest.
   The EKG signal was transmitted to a laboratory in Roslyn, N.Y.,
by putting the telephone mouthpiece over the machine. It took less
than two minutes, with results back in about two hours, Robshaw
said.
   ``It took a while to get the results because the lab didn't have
anything to compare it to,'' Robshaw said.
   The EKG was conducted because an earlier examination showed
fluid around Naples' heart.
   What's good news for Naples may be even better news for pygmy
sperm whales.
   Bossart thinks the process could help discover why the whales
beach themselves. In a study of 18 dead adult whales, Bossart found
that all had died from congestive heart failure.
   He thinks the new process will enable scientists to examine
whales while they are still alive.
   The portable EKG machine is about the size of a television
remote control device, Robshaw said. The cellular phone allows the
unit to be used almost anywhere _ even a manatee pool at Seaquarium.

   A European private collector paid more than $4
million for two paintings by Pablo Picasso and Edgar Degas in
London, Sotheby's said.
   The unidentified buyer on Tuesday night paid $2.36 million for
Picasso's 1953 oil painting ``Woman with Dog'' and $1.85 million
for ``Dancer in Mauve,'' a pastel Degas completed in about 1878.
   The Picasso painting of two distorted figures in strong colors
was a favorite of the artist which he kept to his death.
   A record price for a work by the German-American artist Lyonel
Feininger was paid by Japan's Fuji Gallery: $1.46 million for ``The
Cyclists.''
   It was painted in 1910 and was one of 54 early works which the
artist had to leave behind when, fearing Nazi persecution, he left
Germany for good in 1937. He sent for them but they never arrived
and were only recovered in 1984, 28 years after Feininger's death,
after negotiations the East Germany.

   A bomb exploded early today near the South African
Embassy in Paris after demonstrations protesting the killing of an
African National Congress spokeswoman. No injuries were reported.
   In the southern port city of Marseille, at least six gunshots
were fired Tuesday night at the windows of a building in front of
the South African Consulate. The gunmen fled in a car and no
arrests were made.
   The bomb, which caused only minor damage, exploded about 3 a.m.
in Paris at an office building a few blocks from the South African
Embassy. No one immediately claimed responsiblity for the bombing.
   The explosion occurred a few hours after police arrested more
than 80 demonstrators who broke into the South African Tourism
Office and protested outside the residence of the South African
ambassador in Paris.
   They were protesting the slaying of Dulcie September, 53, the
ANC representative to France, Switzerland and Luxembourg who was
found dead Tuesday outside the door of her Paris office from a
gunshot to the face.
   Police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said at the
time that the killing looked like ``the work of a professional.''
   The ANC, the main guerrilla group fighting white domination in
South Africa, blamed Pretoria for the killing. The South African
government denied responsiblity and said the attack was related to
strife within the ANC, which was banned by South Africa in 1960 for
its anti-apartheid activities.
   A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Tuesday that no
claim of responsiblity had been received.
   In Marseille, the gunshots were fired at 11:15 p.m. Tuesday at
the windows of a building in front of the South African Consulate.
The building was painted with the slogan, ``Botha, assassin, SS.''
The slogan was apparently referring to South African President P.W.
Botha.
   In Paris, 41 protestors were arrested by police Tuesday night
after breaking into the South African Tourism Office after it had
closed and smashing the interior. Two officers and a French
journalist were slightly injured in the scuffle to eject the
protesters from the office.
   Forty-six demonstrators were arrested Tuesday night outside the
residence of the South African ambassador in Paris for painting
anti-apartheid slogans on the wall of the building. Police
identified the protesters only as young leftists who supported the
ANC and all but four were released overnight.
   Earlier, at least 1,000 people marched peacefully in separate
protests of the killing in Paris.
   President Francois Mitterrand said he would ask South Africa
about the attack and reaffirmed his ``categoric condemnation of the
regime of racial segregation.''
   A colleague of Ms. September's claimed that the victim had
requested protection from the Interior Ministry after receiving
threats. She also said she had been followed for several days.
   The Interior Ministry denied she had requested protection.
   ``We were never called on for the least demand for protection,''
a spokeswoman said. ``If she had asked, we would have given it to
her.''
   At ANC headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, spokesman Tom Sebina
called the killing ``part of a deliberate South African campaign to
assassinate ANC members and ANC leaders.'' He said Ms. September
went to Paris in 1983 and was among the ANC's ``most vigorous
activists.''
   The ANC maintains a worldwide network of about 20 ``information
offices,'' including several in Europe, to lobby for support and
receive aid.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   The military today said it captured
the country's top rebel fighter and the No. 2 man in the Communist
Party. President Corazon Aquino said the arrests marked the turning
point in the battle against communism.
   Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano told reporters that Romulo Kintanar,
commander of the communist New People's Army, was among seven rebel
leaders captured in Tuesday's raids. He said authorities did not
immediately realize who Kintanar was because he gave a false name.
   The government-run Philippine News Agency quoted another
military official as saying the chairman of the Communist Party of
the Philippines, Benito Tiamzon, had escaped by the time raiders
arrived at his hideout in suburban Quezon City.
   But his No. 2 man, party Secretary General Rafael Baylosis, was
among those arrested.
   The agency said Tiamzon must have been tipped off by radio
broadcasts on the arrest of his comrades in two raids at the Manila
suburb of San Juan earlier Tuesday.
   Military officials said they believe the rebel leaders had just
held or were about to convene a central committee plenum. They said
search operations were continuing and they expected more arrests in
the coming days.
   Kintanar had long been wanted by the military. Besides being the
alleged head of the 24,000-strong New People's Army, he is widely
believed to be the organizer of communist urban assassination
squads, called Sparrow Units because of the swiftness of their
attacks.
   The Sparrows first began operations in southern Davao City in
the early 1980s before moving out to the Manila area and other
urban centers.
   Among those arrested with Kintanar were Baylosis and Benjamin de
Vera, the Central Committee member in charge of operations on
Mindanao island. The others were New People's Army logistics
officer Napoleon Manuel; his wife Inez; Kintanar's wife Gloria; and
Marco Palo, a member of the party's liaison committee.
   Mrs. Aquino immediately hailed the arrests as ``happy news for
our country'' and commended the armed forces chief of staff, Gen.
Renato de Villa, and other officers and enlisted men.
   ``It clearly demonstrates that we have turned the tide and are
winning the war against the communist insurgency,'' she said in a
statement read by Press Secretary Teodoro Benigno. ``The fact that
they were arrested on the NPA's 19th anniversary (on Tuesday)
attests to the admirable performance of our Armed Forces of the
Philippines. I am elated and so is our citizenry.''
   Montano announced the capture of Kintanar when he presented the
guerrilla leader and other captives to journalists at a suburban
military camp where they were being held under heavy guard. The
only captive not present was Baylosis, who Montano said refused to
be photographed.
   Montano would not let reporters ask the captives any questions.
   Military officials did not mention the name of Kintanar when
they announced the arrests Tuesday, identifying one of those
arrested as Mario Asuncion _ apparently the alias Kintanar used.
   Montano told reporters that Kintanar admitted his real identity
when the officer confronted the rebel later. Officials said the
captured rebels refused to talk to interrogators and would only
give their names.
   Kintanar, Baylosis and de Vera were the fourth, fifth and sixth
Central Committee members to be captured since Mrs. Aquino came to
power in February 1986 in a civilian-military uprising that ousted
President Ferdinand Marcos.
   Former New People's Army chief Rodolfo Salas, whom Kintanar
replaced, was arrested in 1986 while leaving a Manila hospital
following a checkup. Last year, Juanito Rivera was captured in a
raid on his mother's house in Pampanga province north of the
capital. And in February, Tomas Dominado was among 20 suspected
rebels nabbed in a series of raids in the capital.
   Tuesday's arrests came as the military was on a heightened state
of alert in Manila and several other regions in anticipation of
attacks marking Tuesday's 19th anniversary of the New People's Army.
   No major rebel attacks were reported Tuesday, but a Japanese
businessman was shot and killed in a Manila suburb by an
unidentified lone gunman who escaped, police said. The victim was
identified as Akihiro Sato, 49, of Tsuchiura City in Japan's
Ibaraki Prefecture.
   In Luzon's Bulacan province, two suspected communist assassins
shot dead a policeman Tuesday, while government troops captured a
guerrilla in Bataan province, military reports said.
   Reports of attacks in the countryside often take days to reach
Manila.

   Tipper Gore said she still supports
efforts to establish a voluntary rating system for rock music
lyrics as about 150 protesters, some sporting spiked haircuts and
punk-rock clothing, demonstrated against the idea.
   Mrs. Gore, wife of Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore, a Democratic
presidential contender, spoke Tuesday night to nearly 400 people at
the 14th annual National Issues Forum, sponsored by Pitzer College.
   The protesters, including musician Jello Biafra, were
demonstrating against her efforts to initiate a rating system for
rock music similar to that used by the movie industry.
   Mrs. Gore said she does not support censorship, but also said
she is now more interested in helping the homeless and getting her
husband elected president.
   At times chanting ``All we are saying is give rock a chance''
and ``No more censorship,'' the protesters lined two side entrances
to the Beverly Wilshire Hotel, where Mrs. Gore spoke.
   Some waved signs proclaiming ``Ozzy not Albert,'' references to
heavy-metal rock musician Ozzy Osbourne and to Mrs. Gore's husband.
   ``I just don't think any music should be censored by someone
else,'' said Kris Wood, 20, of Burbank.
   Inside the Beverly Wilshire's grand ballroom, Mrs. Gore briefly
acknowledged the demonstration.
   ``I understand that some people are outside protesting my
efforts to call attention to violent and explicit song lyrics that
are being peddled to children. That's certainly their privilege,
but I think they've been misinformed about what my position is _ or
possibly they don't care,'' she said.
   The author of ``Raising PG kids in an X-Rated Society'' said she
favors voluntary ``truth in packaging'' by the music industry and
not censorship.
   Most of her speech focused on the plight of America's homeless,
however, a problem she said her husband would dedicate himself to
solving if elected president.
   She showed a 12-minute video titled ``Homeless in America: A
Photographic Project,'' featuring poems and statements by homeless
people. The tape was produced by several photographers working with
the National Mental Health Association and Families For The
Homeless.
   ``We need a president who understands that homelessness isn't
just a problem of those who are forced to live on the streets. It's
our problem, yours and mine,'' she said.
   The annual National Issues Forum dinner sponsored by Pitzer, one
of the Claremont colleges, has in past years featured such keynote
speakers as former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and
communications tycoon Ted Turner.

<HEAD>What To Do About Those Noisy Tennis Ball Machines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The thunk of tennis ball machines is
disturbing the serenity of some residents at this posh resort, and
town officials ended up with the ball in their court.
   Members of the Ordinances, Rules and Standards Committee
pondered the issue Tuesday: Should use of the machines, popular
with partnerless players on the peninsula's private estates and
members-only clubs, be limited?
   ``I think the people who now have them should be grandfathered
in,'' Mayor Yvelyne ``Deedy'' Marix said. ``But I'm not sure that
any more should be allowed.''
   Town Council Chairman Nancy Douthit lobbed back: ``It seems to
me that when you begin regulating your neighbor's tennis game, it
gets a bit heavy. Supposing I had a noisy hair dryer _ should we
then outlaw hair dryers in Palm Beach?''
   Three years ago, Douthit was adamantly opposed to the
high-pitched, whining noise made by leaf-blowers and had the town's
noise ordinance amended to limit their use.
   The ordinance already prohibits the use during the winter
season, when most part-time residents are in town, of pile drivers,
jackhammers, sandblasters, dredges ``or any engines operated in
such a manner as to emit odors or noises offensive or disagreeable
to the inhabitants of the town.''
   The committee agreed to recommend that the Town Council vote
amend the noise ordinance to limit the use of tennis ball machines
to between 9 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. during the winter and 8 a.m. to 6
p.m. the rest of the year.
   On Sundays, they would be prohibited year-round.

   Spot freezing can save the sight of many
premature infants against a disease that causes 2,600 babies to
lose their vision each year, say officials at the National Eye
Institute.
   The technique of using a super-cooled probe to treat infants
threatened with retinopathy of prematurity has been found to be
effective in about half of the 172 babies treated in clinical
trials at 23 medical centers, Dr. Carl Kupfer, director of the
National Eye Institute, announced Tuesday.
   Kupfer said a clinical alert has been mailed to 2,300 centers to
notify doctors that the freezing treatment, called cryotherapy, is
effective and safe in the treatment of the eye disease.
   Retinopathy of prematurity occurs among very low birth-weight
infants born prematurely. The disease causes an excessive growth of
blood vessels in the retina, the light-sensitive organ at the back
of the eye. This overgrowth of vessels can cause bleeding,
scarring, retinal detachment and blindness.
   Japanese studies in the 1970s suggested that this overgrowth of
blood vessels could be halted and the eye allowed to develop
normally if the sclera, the white of the eye, is frozen briefly.
   Clinical studies in the United States began in 1986. Officials
at the eye institute said Tuesday that the results will be
published in the April issue of Archives of Ophthalmology and in
the May issue of Pediatrics.
   Of 172 infants with the disease included in the study, the
officials reported a 49.3 percent reduction in the loss of sight
for those diseased eyes that were treated. In one group of infants,
where both eyes were affected but only one eye was treated, the
study found that 45.6 percent of the untreated eyes showed an
``unfavorable outcome,'' in comparison to only 24.1 percent of the
treated eyes.
   The freezing treatment is accomplished by touching the eye
briefly with a cold probe, an instrument with a ballpoint-like tip
that is cooled by a refrigerant to about minus 80 degrees. A
surgeon uses the instrument to freeze pinhead-size patches on the
eye.
   Dr. Earl A. Palmer, associate professor of ophthalmology and
pediatrics at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland,
was the chairman of the study.
   He said the results should ``greatly improve'' the ability of
doctors to treat ROP, but he admitted that medical science still
does not know precisely what causes the disease nor why the freeze
treatment seems to halt the disease.

<HEAD>Law Limiting Bearded Firefighters Causes Problems For Amish</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARREN, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new law that forbids bearded firefighters
to enter burning buildings is worrying fire officials whose
departments have Amish volunteers.
   Ohio requires firefighters to wear a self-contained breathing
apparatus to enter a burning building or an area with harmful fumes.
   The apparatus has a face piece that provides clean air from a
tank the firefighter wears on his back, said John Wood, basic
training coordinator for the Ohio Fire Marshal's office.
   On March 1, a new law went into effect that prohibits bearded
men from wearing the devices because facial hair can prevent a seal
from forming between the face and the face piece.
   Most Amish men are bearded and won't shave because of their
religious beliefs. There are several Amish communities in
northeastern Ohio.
   ``It makes it hard for a lot of volunteer fire departments,''
Wood said. ``I really don't know what we can tell them to do.''
   In Trumbull County's Mesopotamia Township, half the population
is Amish, said Fire Chief Keith Williams, and three of the
community's four daytime firefighters have beards.
   The town can't afford to give up its Amish firefighters,
Williams said Tuesday.
   ``I put out a standing order. Yet if they have a structural fire
during the day, I know they're going to put the SCBAs on and go in.
They're going to disregard my standing order,'' he said.
   ``Under normal circumstances, that's grounds for disciplinary
action. But on the other hand, I can't condemn them for doing what
they're supposed to do _ saving life and property.''
   Wood said communities and firefighters won't be fined for
violating the law. But if a bearded firefighter gets injured
fighting a fire in which he needed a self-contained breathing
apparatus, the state will be able to collect half his worker's
compensation pay from the community.

<HEAD>Official Says Cooperative Bank to Be Established</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is establishing a cooperative
bank that will partially end the government's banking monopoly by
providing services to a growing group of small, privately held
businesses, an official said today.
   The bank, which is expected to open next year, would be operated
as a cooperative to serve other cooperatives, according to an
interview with Viktor Arkhipov carried by the official Tass news
agency.
   Arkhipov, first vice-chairman of the Soviet Agri-Industrial
Bank, said the cooperative bank should be allowed to offer higher
interests rates to savers than the 2 percent to 3 percent offered
by state-run banks and to seize the property of borrowers who fail
to meet payments.
   ``Thus the bank will have a vested interest in the high quality
of the products put out by the cooperative, in it finding a ready
demand,'' he said.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who is encouraging the
formation of cooperatives, said last week that nearly 14,000 of
them have sprung up since legal restrictions were eased last year.
   Cooperatives are approved by local authorities and taxed by the
government, but are privately owned. Each person who works in a
cooperative venture owns a part of it.
   Cooperatives have established restaurants, make clothing, pump
gas and provide other goods and services to supplement the
inefficient state-run economy.
   Tass said the cooperatives had financial returns of almost 350
million rubles, about $560 million , by March.
   Tass said that some Soviet economists think a cooperative bank
is a violation of the state monopoly of financial and credit
operations introduced in 1918, just after the Bolshevik revolution.
   But Arkhipov told the news agency that under Gorbachev's effort
to restructure the Soviet economy, the state financial monopoly has
been restricted to foreign economic activity.
   The state monopoly ``is supposed only to coordinate the
activities of the financial-crediting institutions and determine
general financial policy,'' Arkhipov said.
   The cooperative bank also could finance international contracts
of cooperatives, Tass said. Under a draft of a new law,
cooperatives would have the right to trade independently in foreign
markets.

   North Korea today claimed a South Korean warship
violated territorial waters off its coast, the North's official
Radio Pyongyang said.
   Radio Pyongyang, monitored in Tokyo, said coast guard boats were
mobilized in response to an unidentified South Korean warship which
was spotted Tuesday in the North's ``western territorial waters off
Changsan-kot.''
   The report said the battleship fled toward the south.
   ``The act of a military provocation like this by the South is
another planned scheme to intensify the situation on the Korean
Peninsula,'' the radio said. North Korea designates all areas
within 50 miles of its coasts as being within its territorial
waters.
   On Tuesday, North Korea charged that U.S. SR-71 high-speed,
high-altitude reconnaissance planes had intruded its air space 12
times since joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises began last
month.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis today thanked Connecticut
voters for the primary victory that gives him momentum heading into
Wisconsin and the next round of presidential contests.
   ``It was a good win for us. We won with a big, big margin,''
Dukakis said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show. ``But it's not the first
of my victories. I've won in the South. I've won in the Midwest.
I've won up here in the Northeast ... I'm just very pleased that
people who know me best were so supportive.''
   The Massachusetts governor defeated Jesse Jackson by a 2-to-1
margin in neighboring Connecticut, and regained the lead in
delegates to the Democratic Convention.
   The latest Associated Press count put Dukakis at 647.55; Jackson
at 634.55 and uncommitted at 500.6. Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr.
had 364.8 and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon 169.5.
   ``The message ... is getting stronger and stronger every week
this campaign goes on,'' Dukakis told his backers Tuesday night.
   He cited his commitment to job growth, education, housing,
health care, the environment and ``a strong America that reflects
our values and our principles.''
   Hands on his hips, Dukakis also responded to those who have
minimized his New England victories because of his regional
advantage.
   ``It's as absurd to say this should be discounted as it is to
say Jesse's should be because (Michigan) is next to Illinois,'' he
said upon returning to Boston late Tuesday after an evening in New
York.
   He stuck closely to his chosen themes, avoiding any open
criticism of Jackson and refusing to speculate about the vice
presidency.
   ``This sends us back to Wisconsin and Colorado with a very good
boost,'' Dukakis said, adding that each contest is different and
that no candidate will win all of the remaining states.
   Colorado's Democratic caucus is Monday and Wisconsin's primary
follows one day later.
   ``I look forward to going back out to Wisconsin and Colorado,''
both of which pick delegates next week, ``with that same strong
message of economic opportunity and good jobs as someone who not
only talks about those things but who's done them,'' Dukakis said,
underscoring the government experience that he has and Jackson
lacks.
   In a written victory statement, the Dukakis campaign sought to
draw attention to Dukakis' vote among blue-collar white voters, who
had helped Jackson win in Michigan.
   ``Tonight, Connecticut voters across all ideological lines _ and
an overwhelming margin of blue-collar voters _ gave a resounding
endorsement of the Dukakis bid for the presidency,'' the campaign
statement said.
   Fielding questions from reporters, Dukakis predicted that
neither he nor Jackson could hope to collect an outright majority
of nominating delegates by the time the primary season ends in
California on June 7.
   ``This is 15 rounds, and it's going to be a decision _ not a
knockout,'' he said. ``I felt from the beginning that the field
would narrow to two or three'' and that one candidate would have a
``substantial lead.''
   Asked how he felt after rebounding in Connecticut from his
surprising loss to Jackson in the Michigan voting four days
earlier, Dukakis said each race is different and ``it is the
cumulative result that counts.''

   Israeli-backed militiamen stormed a
pro-Iranian guerrilla stronghold in south Lebanon today after
repulsing two attacks on their outposts, police reported.
   Militiamen from the South Lebanon Army backed by Israeli
artillery fire inflicted heavy casualties on the guerrillas, police
and United Nations observers said.
   Moslem radio stations in Beirut said Israeli soldiers also
fought in the battle but police could not confirm that. The Israeli
army denied the reports.
   Police said the attack occurred after the guerrillas, Shiite
Moslems linked to the Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement, launched
pre-dawn raids on militia posts near Kfar Roumman and the town of
Hasbaya.
   No accurate casualty figures were immediately available.
   Police said a South Lebanon Army force, spearheaded by 12
Soviet-designed T-54 tanks, drove the Moslem guerrillas out Kfar
Roumman after heavy fighting.
   The town, a base for the guerrillas of the Islamic Resistance
Movement, is about half a mile west of a South Lebanon Army base
and two miles north of the Shiite market town of Nabatiyeh.
   Most of Kfar Roumman's estimated 12,000 residents fled earlier
as the battle raged. The town had come under repeated machine gun
fire from hilltop army positions.
   ``Islamic Resistance fighters were seen withdrawing from Kfar
Roumman. The town has been devastated by shelling,'' a police
spokesman said.
   Tanks from the South Lebanon Army advanced behind a fierce
barrage of Israeli artillery fire from U.S.-made 155-mm howitzers
in the Israelis' self-designated ``security zone'' north of the
Lebanese border, police said.
   The attacks, the latest in a chain of assaults by the Islamic
fighters, came as Lebanon's Moslems marked the 12th anniversary of
Land Day, when the Israelis killed six Palestinians in 1976 in
protests against land confiscation in the Israeli-occupied West
Bank.
   A strike was also called in Moslem sectors of the country to
express support for the Palestinians in the occupied lands. Banks,
schools, shops, restaurants, cinemas, government offices and other
businesses shut down.
   Palestinians in the occupied territories have been mounting
violent protests against Israeli rule since Dec. 8. More than 110
Palestinians and one Israeli soldier have been killed.
   According to figures released Tuesday by Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled,
chief of the army's northern command, 236 Lebanese guerrillas,
mostly of the Hezbollah movement, died over the past year in
attacks on Israelis and Israeli-supported forces in Lebanon.

   The last of the nation's first test-tube

breathing problem, a hospital spokeswoman says.
   Veronica L'Esperance left the hospital late Monday after being
observed for apnea, a condition in which she stopped breathing
while eating, hospital spokeswoman Carol Jonson said Tuesday.
   Veronica, her brother and three sisters were born Jan. 11 after
their mother, Michele L'Esperance, was impregnated through in-vitro
fertilization. The boy and two of the girls left the hospital March
7, Jonson said.
   Veronica and one of her sisters left the hospital 11 days later,
but Veronica went back into the hospital on March 21. She and the
rest of the quints are doing fine, Jonson said.

<TEXT>
   Officials say they can't be sure it
was a prankster who planted green dye in a pool where highly
radioactive nuclear fuel is stored, even though it happened on the
eve of St. Patrick's Day.
   The 1,270-megawatt Unit 2 reactor at Palo Verde Nuclear
Generating Station was not operating on March 16 when the 241,000
gallons of water turned green. The plant had been shut down Feb. 20
for a three-month refueling outage.
   Chemical analysis revealed the cause of the color change _ green
dye _ but officials said it was still speculative to label the
incident as the work of a prankster.
   ``We don't see any connection between the color change and the
holiday,'' said Don Andrews, a spokesman for the Arizona Nuclear
Power Project. ``We're investigating several possibilities. It may
have been intentionally done. Then again, it may not be.''
   Andrews said Monday that plant security officials were
investigating. He said the incident occurred in a 44-foot-deep
stainless steel-lined pool that holds water in which highly
radioactive fuel rods taken from the Unit 2 nuclear reactor are
stored after use.
   The rods are submerged in water that absorbs radioactive
neutrons and gamma rays. Andrews said the rods are being stored
on-site until federal officials build an underground repository for
permanent disposal.
   U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission officials said they have
determined that ``nothing harmful was added to the pool.
   Greg Cook, a spokesman for the NRC's Region 5 office in Walnut
Creek, Calif., said the commission would deal harshly with anyone
responsible for the prank at the $9.3 billion, triple-reactor plant.
   ``If it turns out that someone was playing a prank, that
individual may need to have his sense of humor recalibrated,'' Cook
said. ``A nuclear power plant is the wrong place to horse around.''
   Since 1984, there have been at least 16 unusual incidents at
Palo Verde, many involving unresolved mischief or suspected
sabotage. But NRC and Palo Verde officials said they saw no
connection between those incidents and the green water.

   A 1{-year-old boy was fatally crushed
when his mother accidentally ran him over as she was parking a van,
authorities said.
   ``It was an accident,'' Joelie Borja, 17, said tearfully. ``I
just ran over him. He was running after a toy, and I didn't see him
come outside.''
   Pablo Sanchez died an hour after he stepped in front the van.
   ``This happens because people leave the doors open, and kids
just run in and out at will,'' said Mike Marker, a traffic homicide

   The car was traveling about 5 mph when the toddler ran
underneath the passenger side of the van, police said.
   No charges have been filed in the case.

   Iraqi warplanes attacked and set fire to
a Cypriot tanker off Iran's coast today. Iranian rebels said their
forces killed 2,000 of Ayatollah Khomeini's Revolutionary Guards in
a two-day battle in southwestern Iran.
   The Kuwaiti Defense Ministry said Kuwaiti forces clashed today
with three Iranian gunboats that had opened fire on Kuwait's
Bubiyan Island in the northern end of the Persian Gulf. Two Kuwaiti
soldiers were wounded.
   And Iran said its warplanes dropped 10 tons of bombs on an
northern Iraqi provincial capital. And Iraq said it fired three
long-range missiles into the central Iranian city of Isfahan,
ancient capital of the Persian empire.
   The Iraqi-backed National Liberation Army of Iran said in a
communique telexed from its headquarters in Baghdad that an assault
force of 15 brigades has returned to Iraq after a two-day offensive
into Iran's oil-rich southwestern Khuzestan province.
   The rebel force, fighting to topple Khomeini's Islamic regime,
claimed its forces also wounded 1,500 Iranian troops and captured
508. Rebel losses were listed as 30 killed and 92 wounded. The
rebel force included two battalions of women fighters and tanks.
   The rebels claimed they captured or destroyed Iranian equipment
including 17 Korean War-era U.S.-built M-47 tanks, armored vehicles
and rocket launchers worth an estimated $100 million.
   The Baghdad communique said the rebels decimated nine battalions
of Iran's 77th Khorassan Division in the fighting south of the
garrison city of Dezful.
   Iraqi jets fired a missile into the Cypriot supertanker Anax,
setting its engine room on fire but causing no casualties, shipping
executives reported.
   The London-based Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit said the
259,447-ton vessel was hit in an Iraqi air raid, although Baghdad
had not reported any ship attack today.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said Iraqi
planes hit two tankers off Iran Tuesday night. There was no
confirmation of those attacks.
   The Anax, which was also hit by Iraqi warplanes Dec. 2, was
attacked south of Iran's big Kharg island oil terminal in the
northern Gulf with a full load of oil. It was on charter to the
National Iranian Tanker Co.
   Both sides have resumed the ``tanker war'' in the last two
weeks, hitting about a dozen vessels. Two Iranian tankers were set
ablaze in an Iraqi air raid on Kharg March 19, killing at least 50
seamen.
   Nearly 500 ships have been attacked by both sides since 1981 and
nearly 300 seamen killed.
   In other action today, Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia,
reported that a squadron of Iranian fighter-bombers attacked three
``important military garrisons'' in Sulaimaniyeh city, an Iraqi
provincial capital in the northeastern mountains.
   The communique said dozens of people were killed in the attacks,
in which the regional state-run radio and television headquarters
was also hit. It was one of the heaviest bombing raids by Iran's
badly depleted air force reported in a year.
   Iran said it was launched in retaliation for Iraqi chemical bomb
attacks on three Kurdish towns in the northeast March 16-17 in
which Tehran claims 5,000 civilians were killed and 5,000 injured.
   The towns had been captured by Iranian Revolutionary Guards, who
have pushed 15 miles into Kurdistan, where ethnic Kurds have been
in rebellion against Baghdad.
   The Iranians claim to have seized 540 square miles of Iraqi
territory in the two-week old offensive. Iraq has admitted losing
ground, but given no details.
   The Kuwait News Agency reported two Kuwait soldiers were wounded
today in a skirmish initiated by Iranian gunboats at Bubiyan
Island, 15 miles south of Iraq's coast. It did not say if the
Iranian vessels were struck.
   Shipping executives, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the Iranians boats escaped Kuwaiti shellfire.
   Iran, which last year fired several missiles into Kuwait waters,
accuses the gulf Arab state of aiding Iraq in the 7{-year-old
Persian Gulf war.
   A Kuwaiti communique declared that Kuwait, which is the closest
state to the Iran-Iraq war zone, ``reserves the right to respond to
any assault on its territory or infringement on its sovereignty.''
   The attack came only a few days after the Kuwaitis had
approached Tehran, seeking to improve relations that deteriorated
sharply seven months ago.

<HEAD>Union Members Arrested During Lunchtime Demonstrations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>

   Police arrested 160 men and
women protesting a pending labor bill that would restrict union
rights, a top union official said today.
   Frank Meintjies, spokesman for the Congress of South African
Trade Unions, the nation's largest labor federation, said members
of three unions were arrested Tuesday as they responded to a call
for lunchtime rallies.
   Police had said in their daily unrest report they had arrested
124 men and women in industrial areas for gathering illegally and
refusing to disperse. Police gave no further details, except to say
that they had used batons and dogs to disperse one group.
   Meintjies said those arrested were members of the Food and
Allied Workers Union, the Paper and Allied Workers Union and the
National Metal Workers Union. They were protesting the government's
Labor Relations Amendment Bill, pending before Parliament, which
would make unauthorized strikes more difficult and require unions
to pay employers' damages for illegal strikes.
   Most of the Congress of South African Trade Union's 750,000
members are blacks, who have no representation in Parliament.
   The congress issued a statement Tuesday listing incidents of
what it termed ``state repression'' against union affiliates during
the past mongth, including detentions, police raids on offices and
removal of union property and records. It has been making similar
complaints for the past year, accusing the government of harassment.
   Police replied in a statement today, saying they do not comment
on ``routine police duties, such as the visiting of premises,
confiscation of property.''
   It also said, ``The police do not act against people because
they belong to certain organizations.''
   However, in the few cases of emergency detainees which have
reached the courts in the past 21 months, the government has often
listed membership or participation in an organization as its reason
for keeping people in detention without charge.
   One such case is that of Zwelakhe Sisulu, editor of the New
Nation newspaper, closed last week. Answering his appeal to be
freed or charged with a crime, the government said he was being
held because of his participation in the National Education Crisis
Committee, a lawful organization, and because of his journalistic
activities. Sisulu denied he was a member of the committee.

<HEAD>ACLU Opposes Restraining Order On Abortion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Civil Liberties Union is
challenging an order that blocked a woman from having an abortion
because her estranged husband objected to her ending the pregnancy.
   The woman has a constitutional right to an abortion that the
judge should not have interfered with, the group said, citing the
Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion.
   The ACLU said it would go to court today to ask state judge
David S. Young to vacate the restraining order he granted last week
to Michael Jon Reynolds, whose wife Jennifer Franks Reynolds is
about two months pregnant.
   Utah is one of four states with laws requiring wives to notify
husbands of abortion decisions, said Planned Parenthood spokeswoman
Mary Carlson. However, Utah is the only state in which the
notification law hasn't been challenged in court or appealed.
   The ACLU said if Young doesn't change his ruling, it will take
the case to the Utah Court of Appeals.
   ``We feel (the order) is shocking and a restriction of personal
liberties,'' said Robyn E. Blumner, ACLU executive director. If the
order is allowed to stand, ``Utah will find itself once again a
target of national mockery,'' she said.
   Blumner said the case demonstrates that the state law should be
repealed.
   ACLU spokeswoman Michele Parish-Pixler said the U.S. Supreme
Court has ruled that no one can stop a woman from ending a
pregnancy in its first trimester. ``It's over-reaching on the part
of the judge to issue any type of restraint on the first
trimester,'' she said.
   Reynolds, who is seeking a divorce and custody of the couple's
10-month-old infant as well as the unborn child, obtained the
restraining order because he is morally opposed to abortion, said
his attorney, Evan Hurst.
   Mrs. Reynolds was served with the restraining order on the day
she was leaving home to have the abortion performed.
   Mrs. Reynolds' attorney, Julie Bryan, said the U.S. Supreme
Court ruled in the landmark Roe vs. Wade decision that husbands
have no veto power over their wives' abortion decisions.
   The high court said that when a husband and wife disagree over
an abortion, ``the view of only one of the two marriage partners
can prevail. Inasmuch as it is the woman who physically bears the
child and who is the more directly and immediately affected by the
pregnancy ... the balance weighs in her favor,'' Bryan said,
quoting from the decision.
   Reynolds' attorneys plan to argue that the Roe vs. Wade case
applies only to the state, not to private individuals.

   Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured
goods fell 0.8 percent in February, the second consecutive monthly
decline, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said that orders for durable and
non-durable goods dropped to a seasonally adjusted $210.86 billion
last month following a 0.6 percent January decline.
   The February drop was the largest since a 1.4 percent setback in
August. The back-to-back declines were the first such since the
summer of 1986.
   But analysts said they were not overly concerned about the
setbacks, contending that manufacturing will still be one of the
top performing sectors this year.
   They said the declines did show that economic growth slowed in
the first three months of the year as businesses cut back on orders
in an effort to work down a high level of unsold goods.
   But the production cutbacks have been less severe than once
feared and economists are now much more confident that the country
will be able to get through this year without a recession.
   The February setback included a drop of 1.1 percent in orders
for durable goods, which fell to a seasonally adjusted $118.5
billion. In an advance report last week, the government had put the
decline at a slightly larger 1.8 percent.
   Orders for non-durable goods, items not expected to last three
years, fell 0.4 percent in February to $97.9 billion.
   In the major categories, defense orders dropped 8.2 percent to
$8.4 billion. Without that decline, orders would have fallen 0.5
percent last month.
   Orders in the key category of non-military capital goods fell
3.9 percent last month to $33.4 billion. This category is expected
to provide major strength this year as manufacturers boost spending
on expansion projects to meet growing export demand for American
goods.
   Orders for transportation equipment were one of the few
categories showing strength last month, climbing 3.5 percent to $30
billion, with the aircraft component showing an even larger 6.8
percent increase.
   Shipments of manufactured goods edged up a slight 0.1 percent in
February to $207.4 billion.

   The Basque separatist organization ETA
claimed responsibility today for the shooting death of a retired
air force general.
   Two men shot and killed Brig. Gen. Luis Azcarraga
Perez-Caballero, 81, Sunday as he left Santa Maria church in
Salvatierra in Alava province with his family and other worshipers.
   Azcarraga Perez-Caballero was the second victim in political
violence in Spain this year. ETA also claimed the shooting death
last week of a Civil Guard officer in the Basque town of Durango.
   ETA seeks independence from Spain for the three-province
northern Basque region. Since taking up arms in 1968, ETA has
claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people, mainly
police, military and Civil Guard officers.
   ETA stands for homeland and liberty in the Basque language.
   In a note sent to Basque newspapers, ETA claimed responsibility
for the slaying and said it would stop its campaign of violence if
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez agreed to talks that would include
the issue of self-determination.
   The Gonzalez government has said it will not talk with the ETA
as long as the ETA continues launching terrorist attacks.
   The government also has said talks with ETA would exclude any
political concessions and focus solely on a plan to get the group
to give up its arms and reintegrate its members into society.

<HEAD>Justice Department Refiles Desegregation Suit Against Alabama
Universities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department has refiled a
massive desegregation suit against Alabama's public universities,
alleging that state officials deliberately continued a system of
separate colleges for blacks and whites.
   The refiling of the 21-page lawsuit on Tuesday was prompted by a
ruling last year by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta, which found that significant errors had been made before
and during trial in federal court in Birmingham in 1985. The case
was initally filed in 1983.
   U.S. District Judge U.W. Clemon had ruled that Alabama maintains
vestiges of a dual school system. But before he could begin the
remedy phase of the case, his ruling was appealed by the state.
   The 11th Circuit ruled that Clemon, Alabama's first black
federal judge, should have stepped down because he took part in
landmark civil rights cases when he was a private attorney.
   ``I would not agree that the case is starting from ground zero
again,'' Nathaniel Douglas of the Justice Department's Civil Rights
Division said Tuesday from Washington.
   ``There have been efforts to resolve the case by negotiation,
and we are ready to continue to do that.''
   The suit filed by Douglas and his staff again charges that state
education officials have ``perpetuated a racial dual system in
public higher education.''
   The Justice Department said two of Alabama's predominantly black
schools _ Alabama A&M in Huntsville and Alabama State in Montgomery
_ operate near predominantly white schools and were intended for
black students only, while whites attended the other institutions.
   Justice Department lawyers said evidence exists of intentions by
state authorities to maintain the vestiges of the dual school
system.
   Federal attorneys cited a 1975 planning document of the Alabama
Commission on Higher Education that said ``with Alabama State and
Alabama A&M to meet the needs of the state's Negro citizens and
with the University of Alabama and Auburn University as major state
institutions, the state seemed relatively well served.''
   The Justice Department said state officials continue to allocate
``far greater resources'' to the major white schools than to the
predominantly black institutions.
   State authorities said the predominantly white and black schools
in Huntsville and Montgomery are the result of decades-old patterns
of preference by students.

   The reputed leader of the Mafia in Southern
California and six associates have pleaded guilty to extortion or
racketeering charges, but they denied being members of an organized
crime syndicate.
   The plea bargains were accepted Tuesday by U.S. District Judge
Ferdinand Fernandez on what was to have been the first day of the
men's trial.
   Prosecutors said the guilty pleas meant the government avoided a
$1 million trial that could have lasted four months.
   The plea bargains were approved by Justice Department officials
in Washington after U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner refused to accept
the length of the negotiated prison terms.
   When the federal indictment was announced last May, Bonner said,
``The main body of La Cosa Nostra in Los Angeles has been severely
gutted.''
   Chief defendant Peter John Milano, 62, of Westlake Village, whom
officials allege controls organized crime on the West Coast, never
admitted he was a Mafia member. Neither did any of the other
defendants.
   Milano, who owns Rome Vending Co., pleaded guilty to involvement
in a criminal enterprise and committing two racketeering acts. But
his attorney, Donald Marks, said that could mean any criminal
group, not just the Mafia.
   Milano faces up to a six-year prison sentence when he and the
others are sentenced May 16.
   Milano's brother, Carmen, 58, of Tarzana; brothers Charles Caci,
51, and Vincent Caci, 62, both of Palm Springs; Rocco Zangari, 54,
of Palm Springs; Stephen Cino, 51, of Las Vegas; and Albert Nunez,
57, of Camarillo, all pleaded guilty to extortion conspiracy.
   Nunez also pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute cocaine,
and Cino also pleaded guilty to making false statements.
   In return, prosecutors agreed to drop additional charges against
the defendants and not institute any civil proceedings that could
result in lawsuits or property forfeitures.
   Nunez faces a 10-year term, Cino an 18-month sentence, Vincent
Caci and Charles Caci face one year, and Carmen Milano faces six
months. Under the agreement, Zangari could receive probation.
   The trial of three more defendants was postponed until April 5
to give their attorneys time to reorganize. The trial of an 11th
defendant was postponed indefinitely because he is ill.
   The indictment involved violations of the federal Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute. The Los Angeles case
was one of several RICO indictments nationwide that stemmed from a
1982 crackdown on organized crime.
   The prosecution was based on hours of secretly recorded tapes
made in San Fernando Valley restaurants and parking lots in which
the defendants allegedly discussed cocaine deals and plans to shake
down gamblers or bookies.
   The indictment followed an undercover FBI investigation during
which Milano allegedly ordered the killing of two suspected
informants, according to the indictment. The murders never occurred
because of tips from informants, officials said.

<HEAD>Los Angeles Jewish Groups Pledge Support For Hammer's Arab Center
in Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an effort to prove that Jews and Arabs can
live in harmony, oil tycoon Armand Hammer and local Jewish groups
have pledged to build a $30 million community center in an
impoverished Arab suburb of Tel Aviv.
   ``We will set an example for the rest of Israel and the Arab
world that Jews and Arabs can live together,'' Hammer said Tuesday.
   Hammer and fellow industrialist Guilford Glazer said they will
raise $1.6 million to help build the schools and recreation
facilities in Ajami-Lev Yaffo, a blighted suburb of Tel Aviv where
more than 12,000 Israeli Arabs live.
   The Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles hopes to
raise $10 million for the project.
   Hammer, chairman of Occidental Petroleum, said recent violence
in the predominantly Arab West Bank and Gaza Strip had nothing to
do with the center's conception. The territories were captured by
Israel in the 1967 Mideast War.
   Planning for the community center began more than two years ago,
he said.
   ``This center will bring people together,'' Hammer said. ``It
will restore pride and provide education and essential social
services so they can have peace of mind and body. Then, and only
then, can they hope to plan for the future.''
   The complex will feature upgraded elementary and high schools,
recreation and sports facilities, a library, and an auditorium.

<HEAD>Two Companies Receive Record Fine For Asbestos Removal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two companies have been fined $130,000
each for the improper removal of asbestos during the demolition of
an old factory, a federal prosecutor said today.
   The fines were imposed for violations of the Clean Air Act, and
the combined $260,000 penalty was the largest ever imposed in the
nation for violation of the act's asbestos regulations, said U.S.
Attorney Stanley A. Twardy Jr.
   Consent decrees between the government and Big Apple Wrecking
Corp. of Middle Village, N.Y., and General DataComm Industries Inc.
of Naugatuck were filed Tuesday in federal court in New Haven.
   General DataComm owned the former Uniroyal Corp. shoe plant in
Naugatuck when it was razed about two years ago. Big Apple was the
demolition contractor.
   The federal government charged in a June 27, 1986, complaint
that the two companies failed to provide adequate notification to
the Environmental Protection Agency before removing asbestos from
the demolition site. The complaint also alleged that the contractor
failed to wet the asbestos during the removal and disposal process.
   After the complaint was filed, an injunction was imposed
requiring the remaining demolition to be completed in compliance
with federal regulations.
   ``In a state such as Connecticut, with its constant renovation
and demolition of aging industrial facilities,'' Twardy said, ``it
is crucial that proper precautions be taken by contractors in order
to prevent asbestos from being emitted into the air.''

<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd called
today for the resignation of Attorney General Edwin Meese III,
calling Meese ``the crown jewel of the sleaze factor in Reagan
administration history.''
   ``He ought to get out,'' Byrd, D-W.Va., told reporters. ``The
country cannot have confidence in the Justice Department when the
top law enforcement officer obviously has to spend an inordinate
amount of his time defending himself.''
   ``He should be spending his time fighting the war on drugs,
crime,'' Byrd said.
   Byrd opened his regular morning meeting with reporters by
saying: ``Mr. Meese has become the crown jewel of the sleaze factor
in Reagan administration history.''
   Byrd said he usually would not call on any official to resign
who hadn't been indicted for a crime, ``but we're talking about the
top law enforcement officer in this country.''
   ``It's just cloud after cloud after cloud, building in layers
over his head to the point where all confidence in this agency is
being seriously eroded,'' Byrd said.
   ``The president ought to ask somebody, if he doesn't want to ask
him himself, to ask Mr. Meese to step aside, step down,'' Byrd said.
   A Republican senator also called today for Meese to step aside.
   ``You finally reach a place where there is a cloud of suspicion,
a sufficient cloud of suspicion, that I think you owe it to the
president to remove yourself,'' Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon told
reporters at an informal news conference.
   Packwood said he did not expect Reagan would ask Meese for his
resignation.
   ``The president will clearly not fire a friend,'' Packwood said.
``The president does not do that to a friend.''
   Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns, Assistant Attorney General
William Weld and four of their aides abruptly resigned on Tuesday.
Burns and Weld offered little public explanation, but told
associates they were concerned that the nearly year-long criminal
probe of Meese is hurting the entire Justice Department, according
to several department sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``I don't really see how he (Meese) can expect to continue to
lead the department after resignations and circumstances like
this,'' former Attorney General Elliot Richardson said on the CBS
show ``This Morning.''
   ``This man is the head of the chief legal agency, the law
enforcement agency of the United States government. And there comes
a point at which the mere fact that he is not indicted is
insufficient,'' said Richardson, who was attorney general during
the Nixon administration.
   ``I think it's just an extraordinary disaster,'' Rep. Barney
Frank, D-Mass., said of the resignations. ``...The attorney general
should quit. ...It's now clear that he can't run that department,
that we're paying a very high price for his stubborness.''

   An earthquake shook southwest Iran early
today and initial reports indicated there were casualties and
damage.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said relief teams
were dispatched to Dehdasht, 340 miles from Tehran in the Boyer
Ahmed province, to ``help the victims and estimate the damage.'' It
did not give a casualty figure.
   Dehdasht has a population of 105,000.
   It said the geophysics center in Tehran registered the epicenter
near Dehdasht.
   The quake measured 5.2 on the Richter scale.
   An earthquake of 5 can cause considerable damage. A 7 reading is
a ``major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a
``great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage.

<HEAD>Governors Group Says Mail-Order Sellers Tax Advantage Threatens
Main Street</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Governors' Association told
Congress today that a sales-tax advantage held by mail-order
sellers ``threatens the future of Main Street America.''
   ``Thousands of small retail businesses that support our
communities and local citizen programs and generate jobs will not
be able to compete in a market in which mail-order firms have a
price advantage that is greater than the actual profit margins of
these community businesses,'' said Gov. George Sinner of North
Dakota.
   Sinner, speaking for his fellow governors, urged a House
Judiciary subcommittee to give the states authority to tax
mail-order sales to out-of-state customers.
   That authority was wiped out by a 1967 Supreme Court ruling. The
court held that a state could not require a mail-order seller to
collect sales tax if the company's only contacts with the state
were in mailing catalogs and delivering merchandise by mail or
public package service.
   As a result, such giant mail-order companies as Maine-based L.L.
Bean can sell by mail to the other 49 states for prices on which no
taxes are collected. The decision does not affect companies such as
Sears, which have outlets in every state.
   Representatives of state and local governments say they are
losing more than $2 billion in sales taxes each year because of the
inability to collect on sales by out-of-state catalog companies,
television shopping clubs and the like.
   A House Ways and Means subcommittee already has approved a bill
by Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., that would allow states to require
large out-of-state retailers to collect the tax. Similar bills are
pending before the Judiciary subcommittee on commercial law.
   Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, a Judiciary member, said his bill
would allow a state to require a retailer to collect sales tax only
if the company regularly solicits sales in that state. It would
apply only to companies whose annual gross receipts exceed $12.5
million or whose sales in a state exceed $500,000.
   William J. Park, president of George W. Park Seed Co., Inc.,
Greenwood, S.C., opposed the bills. He said his company's average
mail order is $32 which, assuming a sales tax averaging 5 percent
nationwide, would generate a $1.60 tax.
   ``It would be prohibitive to collect the estimated tax of $1.60
if the customers did not voluntarily send it. We certainly could
not afford to pay it ourselves,'' Park said, adding that his
company averaged an after-tax net return of 3.5 percent last year.
   Mayor Bob Isaac of Colorado Springs, Colo., speaking for the
National League of Cities, said representatives of state and local
governments are close to agreeing on how to divide revenues from
mail-order tax collections among affected states, cities and
counties. Such an agreement is essential, he said.
   Isaac said he does not take lightly a concern expressed by some
state officials about being ordered by Congress to channel some tax
revenues down to cities and counties. But a reading of the Supreme
Court sales-tax decision ``provides the rationale for concluding
that such a requirement does not amount to an interference with a
state's prerogative,'' Isaac said.

<TEXT>
   The head of the Environmental Protection
Agency has banned use of the insecticide diazinon on golf courses
and sod farms because it kills too many birds, the agency said
today.
   The decision by Administrator Lee M. Thomas overrules an
administrative law judge, who on Jan. 25 found that the benefits of
using diazinon outweighed the risks and recommended continued use
under certain restrictions.
   The decision, effective on publication in the Federal Register
in a few days, represents the first time that the use of a
pesticide has been canceled solely because it killed birds, said
spokesman Al Heier. However, the harm to birds was a large part of
the reasons behind the 1972 ban on DDT.
   About 8 million pounds of diazinon are used each year to control
insects on farms, in nurseries and around homes and gardens as well
as on golf courses and sod farms. The two banned uses account for
about 572,000 pounds.
   In September 1986, the agency announced intent to cancel golf
course and sod farm use. At the time, it said it knew of 60
instances in 18 states where diazinon was a known or suspected
cause of large-scale bird killings. Many involved golf courses,
which some species favor as feeding sites.
   Four hundred ninety-four companies hold federal licenses to sell
diazinon products. The major manufacturer is Ciba-Geigy Corp.

   Suzy says ... Revson's a rat.
   But _ why should WE care?
   Well, that's entertainment in the world of New York gossip.
   New York Post columnist Suzy, it seems, is just a little, eentsy
bit miffed over a column by her upstart rival in New York Newsday,
James Revson.
   Revson wrote last week that he was ``a bit heartbroken'' to find
that _ HORRORS _ Suzy had written about a posh party at the
Metropolitan Museum without attending it.
   Specifically, Revson wrote, ``Suzy ticked off the names of 32
well-known people who, she wrote, had attended the party. ... Well,
there's a sad truth here. Not one of those boldfaced folks showed
up at the museum. NONE. ZERO. ZILCH.''
   Suzy (who actually has two real names, Aileen Mehle) wasn't
pleased.
   Yes, Suzy admitted in today's column, she used a press release
to write about the party in advance so she could slip away for ``a
little vacation on the beautiful, windswept isle of Mustique in the
Caribbean. It was heaven.''
   And yes, she said, it's true that some of the people she said
were at the party never showed up, even though they were listed in
the press release.
   And yes, she said, ``I should have yanked the whole thing or at
least the names the release said would attend.''
   But is Suzy contrite? Not on your life.
   ``I bow in accuracy and meticulousness and decency to no one,''
she wrote. ``That is the reason I have survived as a star all these
long years _ that and because in my field I am the best and the
brightest there is.
   ``And dear readers, fans and publicity-seekers, I would like to
go on record as telling the world that any place ... Revson is, I
will not be. Do not invite me anywhere if you invite him. Just call
it a boycott _ or even a Suzycott.''
   Revson's column made such a splash that even the august Times
took notice, printing a story AND A PICTURE of Revson.
   Not only did Revson show himself to be a rat, Suzy said today,
he gave himself away as ``malicious, sneaky, ugly-mean.''
   Got it?
   More in this space tomorrow. We hope.

<HEAD>Factory Orders Dropped in February For Second Month in a Row</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 5 grafs to UPDATE with factory orders for
February, picking up 2nd graf pvs, `The government ....' A version

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods fell 0.8 percent
in February, the second consecutive monthly decline, the government
reported today.
   The Commerce Department said orders for durable and non-durable
goods dropped to a seasonally adjusted $210.86 billion last month
following a 0.6 percent January decline.
   The February drop was the largest since a 1.4 percent setback in
August. The back-to-back declines were the first consecutive drops
since the summer of 1986.
   But analysts said they were not overly concerned about the
setbacks, contending that manufacturing will still be one of the
top performing sectors this year.
   The factory data followed a pair of upbeat economic reports
released Tuesday, which combined with a more stable dollar and
lower interest rates to lift the stock market out of its slump.
   The government reported Tuesday that its chief economic
forecasting gauge, the Index of Leading Indicators, posted a 0.9
percent increase in February in a performance which analysts said
should lay to rest fears of a 1988 recession.
   There also was good news on sales of new homes. They shot up
20.3 percent in February _ the biggest monthly gain in almost two
years _ after falling for three straight months.
   The positive economic reports helped spark a broad-based rally
in stocks. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 18.57
points to 1,998.34, following steep declines last Thursday and
Friday and a slight gain Monday.
   About 13 stocks rose in value for every six that fell on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 1,015 up, 467 down and 482 unchanged.
   The dollar surged upward from its lowest point since early
January, jumping to 125.26 Japanese yen in late New York trading
from 123.84 yen late Monday.
   Interest rates declined, meanwhile, as bond prices rose. The
Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond jumped about ~ point, or
$8.75 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves
inversely to its price, tumbled to 8.75 percent from 8.83 percent
late Monday.
   Weakness in home sales and in the leading indicators in the
months following the Oct. 19 stock market crash had raised fears
that the 5-year-old economic recovery was in imminent danger of
collapsing.
   Housing is often the first sector to weaken in a new downturn
and the index of leading indicators is designed to forecast turning
points in the economy. For that reason, the February rebounds in
both were greeted as good news by economists.

   Jesse Jackson huddled today with the top ranks
of Washington's political establishment, a summit meeting one
participant called ``a bonding of the Democratic Party'' with the
preacher-turned-politician.
   With such party luminaries as Clark Clifford and John White at
his side, the Democratic presidential candidate said the meeting
was totally positive. Clifford and White denied there were
discussions of fears that Jackson could drag the party's ticket
down in the fall.
   ``No, not at all,'' said White, a former chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, told reporters after the meeting.
   ``We only see that in the press,'' said California Assembly
Speaker Willie Brown, Jackson's national campaign chairman. ``Maybe
people don't want to say that in front of us.''
   Jackson said the breakfast session was ``bringing together
Democrats who have traditional investment in the interests of the
country and the party and those who are new to the process.
   ``In this instance, we bring together old wineskins and new
wine, but the old wineskins are expanding and making room for new
wine,'' he added, using one of his favorite phrases from the 1984
campaign.
   Jackson picked up the backing of White.
   ``This meeting is a new maturing of the political process in
America,'' White said. ``It represents a growing-up of America. It
represents a bonding of the Democratic Party and a bond that
recognizes no class.''
   The one negative that came up at the meeting, according to
participants, was a question to Jackson about his relationship with
Black Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan.
   White said Jackson ``quoted Jesus about casting the first stone
and forgiveness and so anybody who hasn't made mistakes...let's not
be casting stones at each other about the past.''
   Farrakhan campaigned with Jackson early in the 1984 campaign,
but the tie was cut after the Black Muslim leader called Judaism as
``gutter religion'' and called Adolf Hitler ``a great man.''
   Many of those attending were already Jackson supporters,
including former federal budget director Bert Lance, Texas
Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower and Brown.
   Jackson's campaign manager, Gerald Austin, said attendance did
not indicate they were endorsing Jackson, but it would give them a
chance to get to know him.
   ``A lot more people want to talk to Jesse Jackson now than they
did a week ago,'' he said in reference to Jackson's big win in
Michigan on Saturday.
   The victory was followed Tuesday by an equally big loss in
Connecticut to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   Jackson, however, hailed Connecticut as a victory anyway,
because he got 70,000 votes. He said that showed his campaign is
expanding.
   He also said he would not react to the sharp criticism leveled
at him Tuesday by rival Albert Gore Jr., but instead would ``let
the people speak.''
   In the first harsh attack by a Jackson rival, Gore, the senator
from Tennessee, said Jackson has a ``complete and total lack of
experience in the national government. He hasn't served a single
day in the national government, or had a single day's experience in
foreign policy.''
   Answering questions in New York, Gore added, ``I also cannot
disagree more with Jesse Jackson's views on many foreign policy
issues. I categorically reject his notion that there's a moral
equivalence between Israel and the PLO. ... And I am dismayed by
his embrace of Arafat and Castro.''
   Jackson said he was unaware of ``any organized `stop Jackson'
movement'' but that in the face of his success, some Democrats
``are reacting with a sense of history, others are reacting with a
sense of hysteria.''
   The most prominent non-candidate, New York Gov. Mario Cuomo,
said it was wrong to talk of a ``stop Jackson'' movement.
   ``I reject the suggestion that it somehow presents us with a
dilemma if Jesse Jackson wins,'' said Cuomo. ``The person who gets
the most votes should be the candidate and all talk of introducing
somebody to stop Gore, to stop Dukakis or to stop Jackson, that's
all equally wrong.''
   Today's meeting, according to White, was set up even before the
Michigan contest.
   He said Jackson had indicated an interest in ``meeting with the
party regulars and talking about the parts of the political world
he might not be familiar with.''
   Ann Lewis, an adviser to Jackson said, ``The original idea was
to get Jesse together with the Washington establishment ... to
listen to them talk about issues and policies and then to answer
any questions they might have about him.''

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's three largest
supermarket chains reopened their stores today, signaling a major
rupture in a 10-day general strike aimed at toppling strongman Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The government announced that the nation's banks, closed since
March 3 because of a cash shortage brought on by U.S. economic
sanctions, would reopen Thursday with limited service.
   It announced tight restrictions on withdrawals from savings and
checking accounts.
   The Gago, Rey and Super 99 markets in the capital were doing
brisk business after Panamanians rushed to buy food and essentials
that have been virtually unattainable.
   The weakening of the strike came two days after a harsh
crackdown on leaders of the National Civic Crusade, which is
leading the anti-Noriega fight. More than 20 crusade directors were
arrested Monday in a raid by soldiers and state security agents.
Most were detained overnight, then released.
   Owners of the reopened stores could not be reached for comment.
Crusade leaders, who vowed to continue the strike until Noriega
left Panama, have been reluctant to talk since their arrests. Some
of those not detained were said to be in hiding.
   The Roman Catholic church Tuesday joined opposition leaders in
calling for Noriega's resignation. But Noriega, leader of the
15,000-member Defense Forces and the power behind the civilian
government, said Tuesday night he had no intention of stepping down.
   ``Here, it is not one man who is the problem,'' said Noriega,
who blames his problems on what he considers a U.S. slander
campaign against him. ``This is a matter of dignity and conviction
involving the entire hemisphere.''
   In a speech to delegates of a Solidarity With Panama conference
in the capital, Noriega condemned the presence of the U.S.
helicopter carrier Okinawa on the Pacific end of the Panama Canal.
It passed through the canal Tuesday on its way to its home port,
San Diego.
   The U.S. Defense Department said in Washington that the passage
was ``routine.'' But Noriega called it ``a threat and an
aggression.'' There was no immediate indication how long the vessel
would stay in the area.
   Noriega claimed the United States had spent more than $100
million in the effort to topple him. ``But with all the gold in the
world they have not been able to bring this people or this
commander or these Defense Forces to their knees,'' he said,
shaking his fist to wild applause.
   Delegates from about 25 Latin American and Caribbean countries
attended the conference, but few represented governments. About 400
spectators were on hand in the convention center.
   Noriega's forces used a harsh irritant sprayed from water
cannons, tear gas and birdshot to break up a march Monday by 10,000
anti-government protesters. Many people were beaten with rubber
hoses and dozens were arrested.
   Almost all those detained were released by Tuesday. But Carlos
Gonzalez de la Lastra, a top leader of the opposition National
Civil Crusade, was still held at a military intelligence center
early today.
   He had not been allowed access to a lawyer or visits by family
members.
   ``We're worried. We have been told by sources in the Defense
Forces that he has been beaten,'' his wife Vilma, told The

   Gonzalez de la Lastra apparently was not released with the
others because he had been out on bond on a previous sedition
charge.
   A church spokesman told a news conference on Tuesday that Panama
City Archbishop Monsignor Marcos McGrath contacted Noriega and the
opposition and the archbishop had ``a positive impression'' about
prospects for mediation.
   But the spokesman, auxiliary Archbishop Mons. Oscar Brown, said
there's still a lot to be done, ``and because of that we cannot
have an excessive optimism.''
   In a statement, the church said a committee of bishops met with
Noriega last week and asked him ``to separate himself from his
position as soon as possible.'' The statement said Noriega failed
to respond to the request.
   This critical phase of Panama's 10-month-old political and
economic crisis began Feb. 26, when Noriega orchestrated the ouster
of President Eric Delvalle. Hours earlier, Delvalle had tried to
fire Noriega, who has been indicted in the United States on
drug-trafficking charges.
   The Reagan administration continues to recognize Delvalle, who
is in hiding, as president. It has frozen Panamanian government
funds in U.S. banks, denying this country a supply of its official
currency, the U.S. dollar.

   Indian peacekeeping troops killed 11
Tamil rebels, captured three others and recovered 17 AK-47
automatic rifles from a hideout in the jungles of north central Sri
Lanka, officials said today.
   Sri Lankan military officials, who cannot be identified under
briefing rules, said the attack late Tuesday was in Mankulam, near
the district capital of Anuradhpura, about 105 miles northeast of
Colombo. It came after rebels killed 10 Sinhalese farmers in the
region.
   The Sri Lankan government, meanwhile, announced a ban on all
meetings opposing elections in four of the island's nine provinces.
   ``The Cabinet discussed a report that certain political parties
were planning to hold meetings exhorting the people not to vote in
the elections,'' an announcement by the Information Ministry said.
   ``As this is an undemocratic step and may lead to public unrest
in those areas, it was decided that no permission for such meetings
should be granted by the police,'' it said.
   The elections are scheduled for April 28 and 436 candidates from
three parties are running for 155 seats. Sri Lanka Freedom Party,
the largest opposition party, is boycotting the polls and demanding
the government hold general elections.
   The attack in north central Sri Lanka came after suspected Tamil
militants Tuesday planted a bomb on a passenger bus in the same
area, killing 10 Sinhalese farmers and injuring 15 others.
   ``The haul of AK-47 rifles is regarded as the largest single
haul of the this type of weaponry by the Indian troops,'' a
military official said.
   More than 50,000 Indian troops are in Sri Lanka to disarm Tamil
militants under a peace accord signed last July. The accord grants
some autonomy to minority Tamils living in the north and east but
it has been opposed both by Tamil and Sinhalese extremists.
   Tamils say it does not give enough autonomy while Sinhalese
nationalists claim it grants too many concessions to the Tamils.
   In another incident, Sri Lankan police today opened fire ``at a
mob of more than 2,000 people who tried to storm the Trincomalee
police station and a nearby army camp,'' a military official
reported.
   Three policemen were seriously injured and many in the mob were
wounded, the official said. Trincomalee is an important port town
in the Eastern Province.
   The crowd was demanding the release of all Tamil political
prisoners and withdrawal from the area of Sri Lankan security
forces. The security forces are protecting Sinhalese settlements in
the east.
   More than 135 Sinhalese civilians have been killed this month in
attacks blamed on Tamil militants of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam. The group is the largest and most powerful rebel
organization.
   The government says the rebels are launching these attacks to
drive out Sinhalese and Moslems from the Eastern Province and
establish complete dominance. Tamils say the government has
deliberately settled Sinhalese people in the area to upset the
Tamils traditional majority in the area.
   Tamils, who are mainly Hindu, make up about 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people while the Sinhalese, who are Buddhists,
comprise 75 percent.
   Tamils say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who
control the government and the military.

<HEAD>Judge `Outraged' Over Posner Job Contact With Court Official</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court reporter for the federal judge who
sentenced millionaire industrialist Victor Posner in a tax evasion
case has been in contact with Posner's organization for a job, the
judge said in court today.
   U.S. District Judge Eugene P. Spellman, visibly perturbed, said
he first learned of conversations between court reporter Mario
Contillo and Posner on Monday afternoon.
   ``I'm not saying his conduct was illegal, but I feel it was
reprehensible, especially involving a friend of 30 years,'' said
Spellman, referring to Contillo, who the judge said was offered ``a
substantial amount'' to work for Posner. Details of the job were
not disclosed in court.
   Posner pleaded no contest Sept. 29 to evading more than $1.2
million in federal taxes by inflating the value of land he donated
to a Bible college as a tax exemption.
   Posner, who had faced up to 40 years in prison in an income tax
evasion case, was ordered to pay more than $4 million in back taxes
and fines and to give $3 million to help Florida's homeless in an
income tax evasion case.
   The Miami Beach businessman, whose holdings include controlling
interests in Royal Crown Cola and Arby's, also was sentenced to
5,000 hours in community service over five years.
   Spellman called U.S. Attorney Leon Kellner, Assistant U.S.
Attorney Neal Cartusciello, who prosecuted the case, and Mary
Clark, an attorney for Posner, to a special hearing in his
courtroom to discuss his findings.
   Contillo announced last Friday that he was giving up his court
position, Spellman said. Spellman said he wanted Kellner to ``to
evaluate and comment if he wishes,'' on the disclosure.
   ``I don't know all the facts but I felt that as a member of the
federal judiciary it was incumbent upon me to draw attention to
this matter so it could be made public as quickly as possible,''
the judge said.
   ``When I found out, I went through a series of emotions ...
distress and outrage ... that a member of my staff is guilty at the
very least of impropriety,'' he said.
   Efforts by The Associated Press to reach Contillo at his office
or at home by telephone today were unsuccessful. Renee Mottram, a
spokeswoman for Posner, said that Contillo is not employed by
Posner at this time.
   Spellman said the job conversations took place sometime after
the Feb. 12 sentencing of Posner.
   Posner's 1986 conviction was set aside because of jury
irregularities, and he entered the no contest plea a month before
he was to be retried.
   Spellman said today it was his understanding that the court
reporter gave the impression the judge condoned his job
discussions, but the judge said, ``I had no knowledge of the
conversations and I do not condone them.''
   The judge noted that the 69-year-old Posner is on probation and
said: ``I have not taken this up with probation service. If they
feel that Mr. Posner violated his probation, they have the means to
bring it to the court's attention.
   ``I have no reason to believe it was other than an unthinking
and stupid act.''
   After the judge left the bench, Kellner was asked if he intended
to bring the actions to the attention of a grand jury.
   ``I am hearing this for the first time as you are. All I can say
is we will take a look at it.''

<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Jackson, Gore comments in top 12 grafs, picking
up in 12th graf pvs, With 100</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LAURA KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis celebrated his 2-to-1 Connecticut primary
victory over Jesse Jackson today as Jackson met with Democratic
Party elders and dismissed his Tuesday loss as merely due to the
Massachusetts governor's ``home field advantage'' in New England.
   George Bush, with the GOP nomination all but in hand, called on
Republicans to ``keep together and get to work.'' Bush won
overwhelmingly in Connecticut _ as he had been expected to do even
before principal rival Bob Dole dropped out of the race on primary
day.
   Jackson met privately in Washington with leaders of the party
establishment, then said afterward, ``In this instance, we bring
together old wineskins and new wine, but the old wineskins are
expanding and making room for new wine.''
   Participants said the meeting was positive all around, with no
discussion of reports that some Democrats fear nominating Jackson
would lead to crushing defeat in the general election.
   ``We only see that in the press,'' said California Assembly
Speaker Willie Brown, a Jackson supporter. ``Maybe people don't
want to say that in front of us.''
   Democrat Albert Gore Jr., who finished a distant third in
Connecticut, said today while campaigning in Wisconsin that he
expected no backlash from the comments he made Tuesday about what
he said was Jackson's ``complete and total lack'' of the experience
needed to be president.
   Other candidates have been slow to criticize Jackson, but Gore
said his own comments ``were really not that different from what
I've been saying for several months.''
   Dukakis, on NBC-TV, said of the Connecticut primary, ``We won
with a big, big margin, but it's not the first of my victories.''
   ``But this is a marathon and it's going to be all the way to the
finish line. I'm just very pleased that people who know me best
were so supportive,'' he said.
   Jackson, who has beaten Dukakis in two states in the last two
weeks _ Michigan and Illinois _ congratulated the Massachusetts
governor but suggested geography and campaign finances played a key
role.
   ``You did well with your home field advantage,'' said Jackson,
who also appeared on the NBC program.
   Sen. Paul Simon, who barely contested Connecticut, made the same
point Tuesday night. ``We assumed this was Dukakis territory,'' he
said.
   With 100 percent of the Connecticut precincts reporting, Dukakis
had 58 percent to Jackson's 28 percent. Gore trailed with 8
percent, and Simon had 1 percent.
   That restored Dukakis' lead in the national delegate race. The
latest AP count put Dukakis at 647.55; Jackson at 634.55 and
uncommitted at 500.6. Gore had 364.8 and Simon 169.5.
   Jackson swept the black vote and won about 20 percent of the
white vote, according to television network exit polls. His share
of the white vote was put at 5 percent in 1984.
   However, primary-day surveys of voters by WNBC-TV in New York
suggested only one-fifth of the Democrats believed the nation was
ready to elect a black president. ABC found that one-third of the
Democrats would switch to the Republican side if Jackson were
nominated.
   Only last week Dukakis was suggesting he was the inevitable
Democratic nominee. Now he is saying he expects a long duel with
Jackson.
   ``This is 15 rounds and it's going to be a decision, not a
knockout,'' he said Tuesday night. ``It's going all the way to the
final round.''
   Some party heavyweights may have come to the same conclusion.
Jackson was meeting in Washington today with the front rank of the
Democratic establishment to discuss issues and policy.
   Former party chairman John White, who set up the ``summit,''
said it would allow Jackson to talk with Democratic leaders about
``the parts of the political world he might not be familiar with.''
   Jackson came under fire Tuesday from Gore, in the first serious
attack on him by a Democratic opponent. Gore said Jackson has a
``complete and total lack'' of experience needed to be president.
   ``We're not choosing a preacher, we're choosing a president,''
the Tennessee senator said. Jackson retorted: ``I assume that he is
stimulated by his own status in the campaign to attack me.''
   The exchange came as the two were in New York, jockeying for
position in New York's delegate-heavy contest on April 19. Gore was
in Wisconsin today, making an early-morning visit to a dairy farm
where he was to milk cows and do farm chores.
   On the Republican side, Dole's departure left Bush with only a
nominal opponent _ former television evangelist Pat Robertson, who
acknowledged, ``It seems obvious now that George Bush will be the
winner.''
   As the Kansas senator bowed out Tuesday, he put aside his
differences with the vice president.
   ``I return to the Senate as the Republican leader ... ready to
do all I can to elect Republicans in November and doing all I can
for our nominee, George Bush,'' he said. Bush beat Dole by a
lopsided 71-20 margin in Connecticut.
   If Dole's delegates _ now in the uncommitted column _ go to
Bush, the vice president is likely to clinch the delegates needed
to nominate in the next few weeks.
   With the Republican nomination a nearly done deal, Republicans
were holding the first of three platform hearings today, this one
on foreign policy and defense. GOP chairman Frank Fahrenkopf and
the president's daughter, Maureen Reagan, were among those
attending.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, who dropped out of the Democratic race on
Monday, filed Tuesday for re-election to his House seat from
Missouri, saying he was somewhat relieved to have life return to a
more usual pace.
   ``Now we can go to the drug store and the movies and be fairly
normal,'' he said.

   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, by a
vote of 17-2, today gave its approval to the historic treaty
eliminating U.S. and Soviet medium-range nuclear missiles.
   The vote sends the treaty to the full Senate, which is expected
to vote next month after returning from its Easter recess. Leaders
of both parties say the treaty will win far more than the
two-thirds margin it needs to be ratified.
   But some Republicans said today the pact may be in jeopardy
because of a Democratic-backed amendment outlining how the treaty
can be interpreted by the White House. The only dissenting votes
today were cast by Sens. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Larry Pressler,
R-S.D.
   The treaty, signed Dec. 8 by President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, requires both sides to desroy, within three
years, all nuclear-tipped missiles with a range of 300 to 3,400
miles. It will be the first nuclear arms control pact requiring the
destruction of weapons.
   Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., said the Democratic amendment was
``perhaps unconstitutional and very frankly, it may change my
position with respect to the treaty'' on the floor. But Boschwitz
supported the pact in today's vote.
   Pressler predicted the amendment ``will lead to the defeat of
this treaty because the votes aren't there.''
   But Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., the panel's chairman, said
``the amendment's importance has been exaggerated'' and predicted
its eventual approval by the full Senate.
   Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., called the pact ``a very important
step forward'' for the United States.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., agreed. ``In effect, this is a
small step away from the nuclear brink,'' he told his colleagues.
   Today's vote came a day after the amendment was added, a move
that left some committee Republicans angry and threatening to
oppose the treaty when it comes to the floor.
   ``This has been made partisan, unnecessarily in my view,'' Sen.
Daniel Evans, R-Wash, said Tuesday. ``No one has worked harder for
this treaty than me, but I'm now going to seriously take a look at
whether I can vote for it.''
   Evans and other Republicans were unhappy about the
Democratic-written provision, which was added to the measure with
the help of Helms.
   The provision says no future president can change the U.S.
interpretation of the treaty without the approval of Congress,
either through a new pact or through a separate law.
   The measure arises from a longstanding fight between Reagan and
Congress over Reagan's assertion that the executive branch can
unilaterally change how the U.S. government interprets a treaty.
Congressional Democrats disagree with that statement, which Reagan
has used to justify some tests of his Star Wars missile defense
system.
   The tests would violate the original interpretation of the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
   Democrats want assurances that Reagan or another president won't
assert the same right to re-interpret treaties on the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces pact.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said Reagan already has agreed not
to change the U.S. view of the INF treaty and said the proposal
``is a deliberate attempt to embarrass the president.''
   But Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., told Lugar, ``those of us on
this side did not begin this process,'' a reference to Reagan's
assertion involving executive branch rights on treaty
interpretation.
   Helms said he offered his amendment, which he said made minor
changes in the Democratic-written proposal, to make sure the
Democratic measure was constitutional.
   But Lugar was suspicious. ``I frankly don't know at all what
this is about. I'm sure something important is going on,'' he said,
but ``I don't have any idea.''
   Earlier in the day, the Senate met in a rare secret session to
talk about intelligence estimates about the size of the Soviets'
force of SS-20 missiles, which will be destroyed under the treaty.
   The Soviets have admitted to having 650 of the weapons, but
Helms and other conservative critics argue that U.S. intelligence
estimates show that the Soviets may possess up to 1,000.
Administration officials dispute that contention.
   The secret session was the Senate's first since October 1986. It
was held in the Old Senate Chamber, down the Capitol hall from the
current Senate meeting place. The current chamber was unusable
because it is laced with electronic cables that could be tapped.
   Helms said later that his colleagues, ``heard some things they
hadn't heard before.''

   Federal funding aimed at discouraging sexual
activity by teen-agers is valid despite the ``constitutionally
troublesome'' ways some religious groups spent the money, the
Reagan administration told the Supreme Court today.
   Saying that Congress passed the 1981 law ``in response to grave
social, economic and health costs'' linked to teen-age pregnancies,
Solicitor General Charles Fried said, ``In our view, the statute is
plainly constitutional on its face.''
   But Fried, the Justice Department's highest-ranking courtroom
lawyer, conceded that some of the millions of dollars spent under
the law each year may have gone to promote religion.
   ``I do not dispute that there may have been some departures''
from past high court rulings on church-state relations, Fried said,
adding that some of those departures are ``constitutionally
troublesome.''
   Janet Benshoof, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer
representing those who successfully challenged the law in a lower
court, was asked by Justice Antonin Scalia whether Congress was
empowered to authorize self-restraint among adolescents.
   Benshoof replied, ``Yes, but you can't do it by telling young
girls to pretend that Jesus is their date.''
   At issue is whether the 1981 law impermissibly promotes religion
because religious organizations obtain money under it.
   The court's decision is expected by July.
   Urged on by conservative Republicans, Congress allowed religious
groups to obtain money for programs designed to prevent adolescent
pregnancy by promoting self-discipline and to mitigate problems
caused by premarital sex and teen-age pregnancy.
   ACLU lawyers, representing those who challenged the law, said it
``authorizes the use of federal funds to subsidize religious
indoctrination as a means of opposing premarital sex, abortion and
birth control for teen-agers.''
   A federal judge here agreed, and struck down the law last year.
   The law, officially called the Adolescent Family Life Act but
dubbed the ``chastity act'' by its opponents, has three general
program categories _ care, prevention and research.
   ``Care services'' include pregnancy testing, maternity
counseling, adoption and referral help.
   ``Prevention services'' are those aimed at discouraging
adolescent sexual relations, and include programs offering
counseling and family planning.
   The law requires programs applying for federal funding to
describe how, in providing services, they will ``involve religious
and charitable organizations, voluntary associations and other
groups in the private sector.''
   Although finding that the law has a secular or non-religious
purpose, U.S. District Judge Charles Richey said it has ``the
primary effect of advancing religion and fosters an excessive
entanglement between government and religion.''
   He noted that the law ``explicitly permits religious
organizations to be grantees, and envisions a direct role for those
organizations in the education and counseling components of AFLA
grants.''
   The case is Bowen vs. Kendrick, 87-253, 87-431, 87-462, and
87-775.

   After the deaths of Milton and Matilda, two
musk oxen given to China by the United States in 1972, a Georgia
widow began a one-person campaign to replace them.
   Next month, Helen Miller travels to Beijing for a ceremony
marking the success of her efforts and the arrival of two new
animals.
   Mrs. Miller said she learned that just as pandas Ling-Ling and
Hsing-Hsing _ gifts from China _ had become popular at the National
Zoo in Washington, millions of Chinese children visited the Beijing
Zoo to see the oxen.
   So in 1980, after learning that the oxen had died, she began a
letter-writing campaign to the White House, the National Zoo and
officials of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
   She felt it was a matter of ``national honor'' to replace the
animals that had been presented when then-President Richard Nixon
made his historic trip to China as the two nations normalized
relations.
   ``I don't just think about things,'' she said in a recent
interview. ``If they are worth thinking about, they are worth
acting on.''
   Musk oxen, found only in Greenland and Arctic regions of North
America, have heavy fur coats and horns that dip down along their
heads and then up. Hunted for years, they now are protected.
   Mrs. Miller eventually learned that the University of Alaska had
a herd of the oxen and went there. University officials agreed to
donate Koyuk and Tanana, a pair flown to China on March 21.
   ``The Chinese are very excited about it,'' said Mrs. Miller, who
departs in late April. ``There's going to be a big presentation
ceremony. It took a long time, but it was interesting every step of
the way.''
   The ceremony, in early May, will be attended by U.S. officials,
the governor of Alaska and the head of the University of Alaska's
School of Arctic Biology, she said.
   Mrs. Miller's husband, Gibbs, died in 1960, leaving her with
four children. After attending vocational school, she got a job as
a construction estimator.
   ``I like to do things that no one else will do,'' said Mrs.
Miller.
   She has been a contestant on four TV game shows, winning a
Brazilian vacation, two cars, a 65-foot mobile home and two furs.
Three of her children also have appeared on game shows.
   Now that the oxen are in China, Mrs. Miller has a new project,
but for now it's a secret.
   ``You put your heart in it and go to work,'' she said.``If you
believe in something strongly enough, then put feet on your
prayers.''

   Hundreds of Arab protesters
fought Israeli troops today in defiance of a massive clampdown in
the occupied territories. Hospital officials said two Palestinians
were killed and 24 wounded.
   The army confirmed one death and said three people were wounded
on Land Day, an annual demonstration against Israeli confiscation
of Arab land.
   The West Bank and Gaza Strip were closed, and thousands of extra
police and soldiers were deployed. Six Arabs were killed in the
first Land Day protests 12 years ago.
   Police swept through the offices of a key Arab news service and
ordered it closed for six months.
   A Supreme Court panel denied a foreign press request to allow
media access to the occupied territories, but it ordered the army
to explain within 30 days why journalists should not be allowed
free access.
   Only the territories' 65,000 Jewish settlers were permitted to
travel freely.
   In Beit Sahour near Bethlehem in the West Bank, troops clashed
with about 200 protesters who pelted them with rocks, waved
outlawed Palestinian flags and set tires ablaze.
   An Associated Press reporter in the village saw roadblocks of
boulders, rusted barrels, twisted metal and garbage blocking dozens
of winding streets. Four tires smouldered nearby and hundreds of
baseball sized rocks littered the streets.
   In the West Bank village of Deir Abu Mashal, 20 miles northwest
of Jerusalem, soldiers killed a woman and wounded her husband and
two sons.
   The army and hospital officials gave conflicting accounts.
   Doctors at Ramallah Hospital told The Associated Press troops
entered the home of Wajalah Rabir, 50, while she and her family
were eating breakfast and fatally shot her in the head.
   A visitor to the hospital quoted Mrs. Rabir's 17-year-old
daughter, Zeinab, as saying the soldiers came in and asked if there
were any men in the house.
   The girl told the troops no men were home, but they entered
anyway, the visitor said. The visitor, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, quoted the girl as saying a soldier then shot one
brother who started to run. Other family members then lunged toward
the troops, who opened fire.
   Hospital officials said Mrs. Rabir's husband and two sons were
in serious condition from gunshot wounds. The officials, who have
been barred from speaking to journalists, insisted on anonymity.
   The army said the woman was shot after she attacked a soldier
with a rake. ``All those hurt were hurt during a very aggressive
attack on our soldiers,'' the commander said on Israel radio.
``They attacked with pitchforks, axes, clubs and metal bars in a
very aggressive way.''
   Officials at Nablus' Al Ittihad hospital said another
Palestinian, Khalid Salah, 22, died of a gunshot wound to the back
during a clash with troops in the nearby village of Burqa. They
said another Arab was wounded in the shoulder in that clash.
   The army said it was investigating the death which, according to
U.N. figures, brought to 121 the number of Palestinians killed by
soldiers since unrest broke out in the territories on Dec. 8. One
Israeli soldier has been killed.
   Hospital officials said 24 Palestinians were wounded by gunfire,
including a 12-year-old girl near Hebron.
   In east Jerusalem, police officers swept into the Arab-owned
Palestine Press Service and ordered it closed for six months.
   Ibrahim Kareen, publisher of the service, said police told him
the agency was being closed because it was funded by the Palestine
Liberation Organization. He denied PLO funding and vowed to
continue providing information.
   ``All we need is a telephone,'' Kareen said.
   An extra 4,000 police were stationed in Israel's Arab sectors.
   Telephone lines to Gaza remained severed, troops warned on
loudspeakers that curfew violators would be shot, and Gaza and the
West Bank were closed to most outside traffic.
   Reporters were barred from entering the territories without a
previously arranged army escort, and army spokeswoman Ofra Preuss
said violators would be prosecuted.
   The maximum penalty for entering a closed military area is five
years in prison.
   A general strike was observed in Israel's Arab towns, east
Jerusalem and the West Bank. Dozens of mounted police and foot
patrols moved through east Jerusalem's main Salah Edin Street.

   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole told
President Reagan today ``I'm reporting back for duty,'' one day
after giving up his bid for the GOP presidential nomination.
   Dole met privately with Reagan at the White House and didn't
comment as he left. But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told
reporters of the comment made to Reagan by Dole, who had campaigned
as the man who helped steer Reagan programs through the Senate.
   One day earlier, Dole, who for one winter week looked like a
good bet for the nomination, ended his quest for the White House,
as much the victim of his own campaign's shortcomings as of George
Bush's success.
   ``My friends know that I am a fighter; I don't like to lose,''
the Senate Republican leader said in bowing to the inevitable
Tuesday. ``I have been beaten before, and no doubt will be again.
But I have never been defeated and never will be.''
   In an ad-libbed addition to his prepared speech, Dole promised
to do ``all I can for our nominee, George Bush.''
   Bush, with an insurmountable delegate lead, called Dole while
campaigning in Wisconsin to thank him for a ``very generous
statement.'' He added, ``It's been a hard-fought campaign and I
respect the tenacity of Bob Dole.''
   Only Pat Robertson remains in the GOP race as a stubborn
challenger to Bush. Robertson conceded ``it seems obvious'' that
Bush would be the nominee but said he won't withdraw as a candidate.
   Dole formally withdrew surrounded by family and friends in the
Senate Caucus Room, scene of Watergate and Iran-Contra hearings. A
supportive audience of Senate and House colleagues jammed the room.
   Also present were two former senior aides to the campaign, David
Keene and Don Devine, who because of the public manner of their
firings were reminders of the Dole campaign's internal divisions
and ineptitude.
   Dole's withdrawal must have been painful for a candidate who, in
the glow of his lead-off victory in Iowa, could see the nomination
almost within his grasp.
   He benefited in that farm state from his rural, humble roots in
neighboring Kansas, and the contrast with the patrician Bush. His
victory in the nation's first delegate contest left Bush a stunned
third-place finisher behind Dole and Robertson.
   For the next week, critics called Bush a failed campaigner and
Dole appeared on a winner's roll. Even his own pollster told Dole
that he would likely win New Hampshire, riding a surge in
popularity built on his Iowa success.
   But the Dole campaign, thinking it could coast across the finish
line, did not answer tough, last-minute Bush television ads that
suggested Dole would raise taxes.
   Fiercely and historically opposed to taxes, New Hampshire voters
dealt Dole a loss from which he could not recover. Dole later
described his failure to answer the Bush ad as his big mistake.
   Dole's campaign was beset by internal divisions and vacillation.
Critics said it was a reflection of Dole himself, calling him a
consummate legislator but lacking in an executive's ability to
delegate authority or organize.
   After New Hampshire, Dole's campaign went into a tailspin. It
seemed to unravel in embarrassingly full view.
   Campaign manager Bill Brock, in a struggle for control, fired
Keene and Devine as reporters watched. He ordered the two off the
campaign plane in Florida.
   Dole's strategy for winning the White House had been based
primarily on winning the first two contests, and when he fell short
in New Hampshire his candidacy collapsed.
   He found himself far behind Bush in the Southern primaries on
Super Tuesday three weeks later. Unable to focus his energies on
his best opportunities, he lost everywhere. In one night, Bush
moved halfway to a delegate majority.
   Dole couldn't turn the race around in Illinois and was
effectively out of the running.
   In a metaphor of his sputtering campaign, a live 30-minute
television broadcast in Illinois _ planned in 11th-hour desperation
_ was ruined by an electronic glitch.
   Dole was always dogged by a reputation for meanness born of his
hatchet-man role as the 1976 vice presidential nominee. He was
unable to shake it this time around.
   Bitter on the night of his New Hampshire loss, Dole snapped at
Bush during a joint, live network television interview for
``lying'' about his record.
   He was frustrated by a feeling he still had to run against
Ronald Reagan, the man who defeated both Dole and Bush in the 1980
GOP race. Bush, Reagan's loyal vice president, inherited much of
the president's support.
   ``I'm sort of running against the ghost of Ronald Reagan,'' Dole
once said.
   Dole campaigned gamely last week in Wisconsin, his campaign jet
and entourage gone. But Bush had a massive lead in the polls.
   By week's end, Dole appeared to be weary of waging a campaign
that was only going through the motions.
   ``One thing you learn how to do pretty well in our business is
to count,'' he said in withdrawing. ``You come to trust your
instincts to tell you when it's over, and in my heart I know the
time is now.''

<TEXT>
   The City Council unanimously approved
a law requiring pit bulls to wear muzzles in public, the first of
its kind in the nation.
   The measure, approved Monday, still must be OK'd by provincial
authorities.
   There has been a recent increase in publicity over attacks by
pit bulls, which are becoming very popular in the Netherlands.
Nationwide, there are about 6,000 of the dogs.
   A pit bull terrier killed a horse in the southern city of
Eindhoven this month, and several people have been injured in
recent pit bull attacks.
   Although written with the pit bull terrier in mind, the Gouda
law would order muzzling for ``a breed designated as dangerous (by
the city fathers) or any of its descendants obtained by
cross-breeding.''
   Pit bull owners convicted under the new bylaw would face a
$2,600 fine.

<HEAD>FAO Says World Rice Stocks Falling Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World rice stocks are expected to fall by more than
30 percent this year to about 35 million tons, the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization reported Wednesday.
   A report by the FAO's intergovernmental group on rice said the
change in the world rice market from one of surplus to limited
supplies and rising prices was due largely to adverse climactic
conditions.
   It also said some countries had adopted measures to reduce
output.
   The FAO group warned that another year of falling output could
cause serious food security problems.
   The reduction in rice stocks was described as ``particularly
acute'' in major producing countries in the developing world, such
as China, India, Bangladesh, Burma, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan,
Thailand and Sri Lanka.
   In the United States, stocks were forecast to fall by more than
50 percent to 800,000 tons by the end of 1988.

<TEXT>
   The third installment of a four-part Easter
series, ``Strangers No Longer,'' concerns with the
Protestant-Catholic convergence toward unity, dealing with official
dialogues.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   From across Christianity's denominational spectrum, reactions to
a proposal for unity have poured into the headquarters of the World
Council of Churches in Geneva, Switzerland.
   ``The response has been tremendous,'' said the Rev. Gunther
Gassman, a Lutheran and director of the council's Faith and Order
Commission, an inclusive Protestant-Roman Catholic-Eastern Orthodox
unit that is compiling the appraisals.
   ``It's a unique thing in the history of the ecumenical
movement,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``Never has there
been so much interest and discussion of a church document
throughout the world.''
   Roman Catholic, Protestant and Eastern Orthodox denominations,
170 of them from around the globe, have sent official responses to
an agreement jointly produced by their thinkers on a reintegrated
faith.
   ``BEM,'' it's called, standing for the central aspects of
baptism, eucharist (celebrating the Lord's Supper) and ministry.
   Sometimes called the ``Lima Text,'' it was produced by a
commission of 120 theologians, Bible scholars, historians, clergy
and lay leaders at a meeting in Lima, Peru, in 1982.
   ``We have become increasingly aware of our unity in the body of
Christ,'' they said. ``Sadly divided churches have been enabled to
arrive at substantial theological agreements. We believe many
significant advances are now possible.''
   To that end, BEM circulated among the churches for five years,
translated into 35 languages. After pondering, the denominations
have now voiced their assessment, the broadest ever attained in an
ecumenical accord.
   ``It's a towering achievement,'' said the Rev. John Hotchkin,
ecumenical officer for U.S. Catholic bishops. ``It could serve to
put a new floor under the ecumenical movement. It's a very
important landmark.''
   The Vatican also appraised the document, generally commending
the results, but asked for further elaborations, especially on the
ministry.
   The responses are being distributed to the churches in six
volumes, with the last two still to be compiled. A summary will be
considered by the joint commission at a meeting in August 1989, and
any clarifications and adaptations will be taken care of before the
final document is presented to churches by 1991.
   ``Then it's up to them,'' Gassman said. ``Our strong hope is
that they act on it in the next 10 years, initiating some form of
eucharistic sharing. Many of them are ready to do so now.''
   BEM offers concordant beliefs about key functions of the church,
drawing on common biblical roots and Christianity's centuries prior
to the 1054 schism that separated Rome and Eastern Orthodoxy and
the 16th-century Protestant break from Rome.
   The document challenges present-day churches to affirm this
common, early core of faith. Baptism of infants as well as adults
is recognized, with precedents for each in practices of the early
church.
   Regarding the eucharist, the approach goes behind the medieval
Catholic doctrine of ``transubstantiation,'' upholding instead a
broader concept of Christ's ``real presence'' in celebration of the
Lord's Supper.
   On the ministry, BEM recommends a threefold tier of bishops,
presbyters and deacons. Most major churches have all three, but
usually refer to presbyters as pastors, priests or ministers. Some
Protestant bodies avoid the term bishop but have parallel
overseeing offices under other titles.
   The responses have been as varied as the denominations. The
Vatican's 40-page response wasn't as long as the Salvation Army's
70 pages, the longest. The shortest, a half page from the
Presbyterian Church of New Zealand, simply said fine, let's go with
it.
   ``We've made an enormous lot of progress in the churches'
acceptance of each other,'' said the Rev. John Deschner, a United
Methodist from Southern Methodist University's Perkins School of
Theology in Dallas, who chairs the World Council commission. ``A
trust has developed among Protestant, Catholic and Orthodox
churches that is beyond what we'd ever dared hope.
   ``BEM culminates the rising pleas for increased acts of mutual
recognition of members and ministry, a kind of unity of mutual
hospitality, welcoming each other in each other's denominational
context, acknowledging each other before God.''
   Paving the way for BEM has been a swelling profusion of
dialogues and surprising accords among the denominations.
   On national and international levels, the bilateral talks have
gone on 20 years between teams of Catholics with Lutherans, with
Methodists, with Anglicans, with Baptists, with Disciples, with
Eastern Orthodoxy, with Presbyterians, with Pentecostals, with
Evangelicals.
   At the same time, Protestant bodies have met with one another,
scrutinizing their respective views, seeking closer understanding
and concurrence.
   It has become a vast, interconfessional conversation, a constant
to-and-fro hum of inquiry, explanation, discovery and, often
surprisingly, consensus.
   The talks probe the tangle of mutual misconceptions, mistaken
impressions and caricatured images accumulated through centuries of
alienation from one another.
   They seek to clear up where each really stands. On many points,
it turns out to be together.
   For instance, Lutherans and Anglicans in separate dialogues with
Catholics determined they basically agreed on a key issue of the
16th-century Protestant Reformation that had divided them.
   Protestants emphasized ``justification by faith'' alone, that
salvation comes only through faith in Christ's forgiving grace, and
asserted that Rome claimed the church dispensed grace for earned
merit.
   But it turns out that arguments in the heat of old battle were
misconstrued on both sides. They now agree _ as the U.S.
Lutheran-Catholic team put it _ that ``our entire hope of
justification and salvation rests on Christ Jesus'' and his
forgiving grace.
   Similarly convergent views have been found about the papacy
itself, with Anglicans and Lutherans agreeing on the benefit of a
unifying center, a presiding bishop of a pastoral rather than
juridical kind, responsible to regular ecumenical councils.
   The deluge of dialogue reports have dealt with virtually all
basic issues of churchmanship _ spirituality, Scripture, apostolic
succession, conversion, worship, grace, authority, the Holy Spirit,
family, mixed marriages, salvation and papal primacy, usually with
degrees of agreement.
   ``So much is happening, there is so much development that it's
hard to keep up,'' said Catholic Brother Jeffrey Gros, who heads
the Faith and Order office of the U.S. National Council of Churches.
   In a book summarizing a score of such understandings, ``Growth
in Agreements,'' Lutheran scholar Harding Meyer and Reformed
scholar Lukas Vischer say the dialogues ``constantly point beyond
themselves,'' so the main aim no longer is ``just reaching of
consensus but translation ... into practice in the living
fellowship of the churches.''
   Many issues remain unsettled between Rome and Protestantism on
such issues as ordination of women, which Catholicism and Orthodoxy
forbid. But Anglicans and Catholics, in new talks, are discussing
it.
   Different shades of understanding, terminology and doctrinal
nuances also linger, as do conflicts on social issues such as
abortion and divorce, along with bureaucratic inertia.
   ``The ecumenical movement is a glacier,'' said Lutheran Bishop
Herbert W. Chilstrom, head of the newly unified Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America. ``It moves slowly, but it does move.''

<TEXT>
   The court presiding over the Nazi war crimes
trial of retired U.S. autoworker John Demjanjuk will announce its
verdict on April 18, the government said Wednesday.
   Demjanjuk, 67, is accused of being ``Ivan the Terrible,'' the
guard who operated gas chambers that killed 850,000 Jews at the
Treblinka death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland.
   If convicted, Demjanjuk could be sentenced to death. The
Ukrainian-born defendant claims he is a victim of mistaken identity.
   Demjanjuk was extradited to Israel in February 1986 from the
Cleveland suburb of Seven Hills.
   His trial ended Feb. 10 after a year of testimony. The
three-judge panel reopened hearings for two days in March to
introduce new evidence at the request of defense attorney Yoram
Sheftel.
   Sheftel presented the court with statements from 12 camp
survivors who did not identify Demjanjuk as ``Ivan.''
   At the beginning of the hearings, five prosecution witnesses
identified Demjanjuk as the Treblinka camp guard from photographs.
   The prosecution's key piece of evidence is an alleged SS card
stating that Demjanjuk was trained as a concentration camp guard.
Demjanjuk says the card is a forgery.

<HEAD>French Statesman Edgar Faure Dead At 79</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Edgar Faure, the brilliant statesman who died
Wednesday at the age of 79, was hailed by friends and foes alike
for his political savvy, intelligence and wit.
   Faure occupied every important post in the French government
except the presidency during a career that spanned four decades.
   President Francois Mitterrand, a fellow socialist, called Faure
``a remarkable man who marked the history of our Republic.''
   Jean-Marie Le Pen, presidential candidate from the extreme-right
National Front, praised Faure's ``intelligence and tolerance,''
despite ``our differing conceptions of political action.''
   The bespectacled, balding father figure, known to the French
simply as ``Edgar,'' was best remembered as one of the nation's
most progressive education ministers.
   Under Gen. Charles De Gaulle, during the 1968 student uprising,
he masterminded vast reforms that allowed French universities more
autonomy.
   Faure was a member of the French Academy and wrote books on
subjects ranging from French oil policy to modern China.
   A Renaissance man, Faure even wrote musical scores. Under the
pseudonym Edgar Sanday, he published detective novels.
   Faure was born on Aug. 18, 1908, in the southwestern city of
Beziers, where his father, an army doctor, was stationed. He
graduated from high school at the age of 15, earned his doctorate
in law at 19 and was a practicing lawyer at 21.
   He was fluent in Russian, and years later, would stun a Soviet
trade delegation negotiating without a translator for four hours
straight, stumbling only once _ over the word ``corkscrew.''
   Yet he had an old-fashioned sense of honor and once challenged a
prominent magazine reporter to a duel for having questioned in
print his motives for reducing taxes on race horses. Notoriously
near-sighted, he was already waving the pistol when a colleague
managed to talk him out of it.
   Faure's successful law career was interrupted by World War II.
In 1942, Faure and his wife Lucie Meyer, the elegant publisher of a
political review, fled France for Algiers.
   After the war, he was financial adviser to Socialist governments
led by his close friend Pierre Mendes-France.
   In 1947, he was elected to public office for the first time,
serving as a deputy for the Jura department in eastern France.
   From that time on, he served in the cabinets of numerous prime
ministers, holding more ministerial appointments than any other
public official.
   Faure's first wife, Lucie Meyer, died in 1977. He is survived by
his second wife, Marie-Jeanne Vuez, and two daughters. Burial will
be Saturday in Paris following services at his church and at the
National Assembly.

<HEAD>Hospital Sold To Raise Money To Keep Cocke County Schools Open</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SHARP</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWPORT, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocke County officials knew they had to
come up with $345,000 quickly to keep public schools open after
spring break. So they decided to sell the county-owned hospital.
   The deal negotiated between the county and Baptist Health
System, which was renting the hospital, benefits everyone, but
primarily prevents the nightmare of closing schools, County
Executive Charles Lewis Moore said Tuesday.
   ``We can't have that,'' he said. ``That's absolutely not
satisfactory to anyone. One concern was that some seniors who have
scholarships and financial assistance would lose it, plus it would
affect employees and parents.''
   The $1 million sale was approved 20-0 by the Cocke County
Legislative Body on Monday night.
   The county lawmakers then provided the school system with
$200,000, the minimum on which the schools could operate the rest
of the term, and agreed to invest the remainder in an industrial
park.
   The sale includes a 74-bed hospital, a 56-bed nursing home and a
building housing three doctors' offices. Baptist Health System,
based in Knoxville, had leased the hospital since 1982, and last
year extended that lease through 1999.
   At any point during those 17 years, Baptist had the option of
buying the hospital for $1.58 million, or $580,000 more than the
actual sale price.
   But county officials say they can get roughly $3.6 million out
of the deal in interest on the remaining $800,000, plus money saved
because the deal exempts the county from funding care of indigents
at the hospital for the next 12 years. That had been costing about
$35,000 a year.
   County officials praised Baptist Health for coming to the
county's rescue.
   ``We frankly had not intended to buy right now,'' said Robert
Chandler, president of Baptist Health System. ``But they were
having some financial problems, especially with funding the school
system. So we felt we could help by buying now. Helping the schools
was our main motivation.''

   Red Wing (Minn.) Republican Eagle on George Bush's presidential
campaign:
   If there's any political fallout over the Civil Rights
Restoration Act, it's likely to land on George Bush.
   Although his support of a presidential veto will enhance his
standing with conservatives, it will hinder his efforts to attract
blacks and other minorities into the Republican Party.
   Democrats are sure to exploit the issue. ... Once again, he's
perceived to be (President Reagan's) puppet.
   Democrats will take any fallout they can get. If the election is
close, the failure of the Republican Party to attract more blacks
and minorities because of Bush's stance on the veto might be the
difference.

   The Honolulu Advertiser on the cease-fire in Nicaragua:
   Some sort of humanitarian aid for the Contras is necessary for
the period of phasing down and out. Withdrawing our troops from
Honduras _ with no arms left behind _ is necessary.
   At some point, there must be talks between Washington and
Managua on a more normalized relationship.
   Many will continue to question whether the whole Contra
operation was necessary and worth the cost in terms of bloodshed in
Central America and damage in the U.S. government process.
   There may have been better ways to deal with whatever dangers
the Sandinistas pose in the region.
   Yet it could end up a no-lose situation for President Reagan. If
the cease-fire and peace process work, there is little doubt he
will say that his tough policy worked. And if they fail, he can
blame the Congress and others for killing off the Contras.

   The Evansville (Ind.) Courier on preventing teen suicides:
   We are shocked and saddened by the three suicides involving
present and former Reitz High School students. Yet our grief now
must give way to concern.
   There seems no direct connection among the three, other than
what experts call a copycat syndrome. One person commits suicide;
another troubled individual learns of it, even sees it as an escape
from despair, and the chain reaction begins.
   It's critical now that those closest to students _ parents,
school personnel, classmates _ see that the chain is broken. ...
   Talk to your children, talk to your classmates, and if you're
troubled yourself, seek someone who will listen _ no problem is so
insurmountable.
   So often when we learn of suicide, we hear the word
helplessness. No, we can't help those who have already taken their
lives, but for others who may be troubled, we are not helpless,
especially now that our consciousness has been raised so tragically.
   We must be alert; we must care; we must talk.

   If the two sides trying to force changes in
the 1990 census both get their way, the results would nearly
balance one another, a population expert said Wednesday.
   The Census Bureau is under pressure to exclude illegal aliens
from its national head count. Traditionally, it counts everyone
living in the country.
   Groups which have filed suit to ignore the aliens contend large
concentrations of them could result in in some states gaining seats
in the House of Representatives at the expense of other states.
   Meanwhile, other groups want the final census totals to be
increased to account for people who may be overlooked in the census
_ most often blacks and Hispanics living in urban areas.
   At stake are the 435 seats in the House, which are distributed
among the states on the basis of population.
   ``If both sides get their way, the only change would be a
flip-flop of one seat from California to Georgia,'' said William
O'Hare, director of policy studies for the independent Population
Reference Bureau.
   O'Hare told a breakfast briefing for Northeast and Midwest
members of Congress that he estimates their region will lose 14
House seats following the 1990 census. That would continue a trend
evident over the last several decades, he noted.
   Using estimates of the number of illegal aliens and undercounted
minorities, he said that deleting the one group and adding in the
other would make little difference in the long run.
   The only change, he said, would be that California would gain
five new seats instead of six, while Georgia would add two rather
than just one.
   ``That's easy to understand, since there are so many
undocumented aliens in California,'' he commented.
   O'Hare's study of potential changes in House seats _ based on
1990 projections with no adjustments _ calls for California to be
the big gainer, adding six House seats, followed by Florida with a
gain of four and Texas adding three.
   Expected to pick up one seat each are Virginia, North Carolina,
Georgia, and Arizona.
   On the other hand New York would lose three seats. States losing
two apiece would be Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois and Michigan.
Expected to lose one house seat are Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Iowa,
Kansas, West Virginia and Montana.

   Two mixed-breed dogs attacked a Seeing
Eye dog, causing trauma that may make the $10,000 animal useless as
a guide, its owner said.
   Ollie, an Australian shepherd owned by Linda Watson, 34, will be
off his feet for about two weeks with bite wounds to the left front
leg and neck. His life was saved Tuesday by two passersby who
kicked and beat the attacking dogs with a wrench and broom until
they gave up.
   Ms. Watson and a co-worker were walking during their lunch break
when Ollie was attacked.
   When they were beaten off, the attacking dogs retreated into the
home of their owner, Joseph Frances Beasley, so animal-control
officers couldn't impound them, said Jimmy Dykes, supervisor of
Escambia's animal shelter.
   But Dykes said officers cited Beasley for failure to have the
dogs vaccinated and licensed.
   Ms. Watson said that while Ollie will recover physically, the
attack may make him aggressive. ``If that's the case, I've lost a
dog worth $10,000,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Two laboratory workers died of a rare brain
infection called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and both might have
resulted from on-the-job exposure to contaminated tissue, doctors
report.
   The cases were reported in separate letters to the editor in
Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
   In one letter, Douglas C. Miller of New York University Medical
Center described the case of a 62-year-old woman who had worked in
a medical lab for 22 years. Her duties included preparing slices of
human brains.
   After she died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, doctors discovered
she had worked with tissue from two people who had also died of the
disease 11 and 16 years earlier.
   Miller said the woman's illness ``most likely'' resulted from
occupational exposure.
   In the other letter, Lucian Sitwell and colleagues from Ottawa
Civic Hospital in Canada outlined a similar case in a 75-year-old
physician who dissected tissue, mostly from animals, in a medical
school.
   Sitwell said the man may have been exposed to tissue from sheep
that had scrapie. Some experts theorize that scrapie and
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease are caused by the same, so far
unidentified infectious agent.
   Creutzfeldt-Jacob diseases causes slow, progressive loss of
mental faculties. It has been spread through transplants of brain
tissue and corneas as well as growth hormone derived from human
pituitary glands.

   Vice President George Bush would have ``no
reluctance'' to criticize Jesse Jackson if he is the Democratic
nominee, a spokesman said today.
   Bush, rejoicing in his clear path to the Republican presidential
nomination, is starting to focus on the general election campaign,
including strategy against his eventual Democratic opponent.
   ``If Jackson is the nominee, we will feel very willing to attack
him on the issues. There will be no reticence, there will be no
reluctance,'' Bush spokesman Pete Teeley said aboard Air Force II.
   Jackson's Democratic rivals have left Jackson alone until
recently, working under the conventional assumption that Jackson
could not win the nomination. But as Jackson racks up win after
win, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. has expressed a willingness to criticize
Jackson on the issues and his lack of experience in government.
   Bush, assured of the GOP nomination, will continue to campaign
hard to guard against complacency, Teeley said.
   ``It feels great,'' Bush declared Tuesday, giving a thumbs-up
sign to reporters after learning of the withdrawal of Sen. Bob
Dole, the same day Bush sailed to an overwhelming win in the
Connecticut primary.
   Meanwhile, Bush organizers are scurrying to find new ways to
keep attention focused on the candidate now that he is without a
major GOP rival.
   For one thing, Bush plans to continue to make high-profile
campaign appearances in states with key primaries _ including New
York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and California.
   ``The immediate task ahead is unity,'' Bush told a GOP dinner
Tuesday night after his Connecticut victory was announced. ``We
Republicans have no reason for complacency.''
   He said that Republicans now must present their party as ``a big
party with big open doors.''
   ``The challenges we face will never be met unless we meet them
together, hand-in-hand, as brothers and sisters, as blacks and
whites, as northerners, southerners, East and West, the wealthy and
the wanting,'' he said.
   He complimented Dole for a ``very gracious statement'' in
dropping out of the race. ``I know exactly how he must feel. I was
there, eight years ago,'' Bush said, referring to his unsuccessful
1980 presidential bid.
   Not all Bush supporters were as jubilant about recent
developments as were the vice president and his top strategists.
   Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, said that Dole's exit could hurt
Bush's chances in the fall campaign now that ``it's obvious he's
going to win the nomination.''
   ``I can't see the fact that the vice president doesn't have any
more opposition is that good for him. It's good to have a
primary,'' said Thompson, a strong Bush backer.
   Thompson, who has been accompanying Bush in his three-day
campaign swing in advance of the April 5 Wisconsin primary, said
many Wisconsin independents and some Republicans are now likely to
vote in the Democratic primary.
   ``Those individuals who come out of a hotly contested primary
can use it as a springboard to solidify the party,'' Thompson said.
   The Republican governor, who earlier in the week had suggested
he would vote for Democrat Jesse Jackson were he a Democrat,
indicated Jackson would be hard for Bush to beat in November.
   ``He (Jackson) is a viable candidate. He's very exciting. I like
the guy,'' Thompson said.
   GOP officials in Wisconsin urged party members who had supported
Dole against crossing over and voting in the Democratic primary
next week.
   And top Bush aides conceded that lack of a contest could steal
the spotlight away from their candidate.
   ``We're going to have to display some creativity'' in keeping
Bush's candidacy before the public, said Bush aide Peter Teeley.
   Although Bush is running virtually alone for the GOP nomination,
it will be at least a couple of weeks before he can gain enough
delegates for a majority at the GOP convention.
   Assuming he wins every delegate that can be won from now on, he
would cross that threshold on May 3, when Ohio, Indiana and the
District of Columbia hold their primaries. But if he picks up
Dole's delegates _ now counted as uncommitted _ he could go over
the top as early as April 15, when Minnesota holds its GOP state
convention.
   Bush's sole remaining challenger is former television evangelist
Pat Robertson, who has but 17 delegates.
   Bush had said he would keep on campaigning hard, right up until
the time Dole announced he was retiring from the race. Dole's exit
makes the April 5 GOP primary moot.
   ``It changes some of the dynamics. It removes some of the
tension,'' Bush said of Dole's withdrawal.
   ``I don't like running against other Republicans,'' he added.
   Bush said he had called Dole to ``congratulate him on a
hard-fought race...He has been a worthy warrier and a tough
competitor.''
   Bush said that, while he intends to continue to ``campaign'' in
key states, ``the schedule will be somewhat lighter. And I'll have
more time to flesh out the issue positions.''

   The landlord of a building where
150 narcotics officers conducted a raid will reimburse police for
the cost of the bust and to move innocent tenants to safer
apartments, authorities said.
   The agreement was part of a judgment in San Mateo County
Superior Court announced Tuesday.
   District Attorney Jim Fox said it is the first in the region in
which law enforcement officials successfully sued apartment
building owners under a state nuisance abatement law intended to
combat drug dealers.
   The action ``sends a message to property owners that they have
an affirmative duty'' to stop drug dealing in their buildings, Fox
said.
   There were more than 75 drug-related arrests at the building
from June 1985 to the December bust, when 22 people were taken into
custody.
   The landlord, 2001 Manhattan Apartments Inc., of Sausalito,
agreed to pay $25,000 in civil penalties, $7,500 to the drug task
force and $2,500 to the East Palo Alto police for the cost of
enforcing drug laws at the building.
   The owners also have paid $13,000 in relocation expenses for
eight families.

   Brady, 36, will succeed Jay Stephens in the position. Brady has
been deputy assistant to Vice President George Bush since 1985.
Before that he was in the Justice Department.
   He was deputy attorney general of California in 1978 and 1979.
   The president also announced the appointment of William J.
Landers, 36, now with the Justice Department, as associate counsel
to the president. Landers was deputy city attorney of Los Angeles
in 1978 and 1979.
   The White House also announced two judicial nominations the

   A man has been ordered to work 200 hours
at an animal shelter after he admitted trying to kill a stray dog
with arrows.
   Joseph T. Irvine of Las Vegas says he will appeal his conviction
Tuesday of injuring, torturing or abandoning an animal.
   Justice of the Peace Bill Jansen ruled Irving was not legally
justified when he armed himself with a hunting bow and shot the dog
twice.
   The judge could have imposed a six-month jail term and a $1,000
fine, but said community service at the animal shelter might teach
Irvine respect for animals.
   The dog, which has since been adopted and named Lucky, sat in a
chair in the courtroom Tuesday.
   Irvine claimed the animal followed him into his home after he
tried to befriend it. He said he shot the dog once in the head with
an arrow, then decided it was not enough and loaded the bow, then
``let him have it again.''

   NASA on Wednesday asked the nation's
schoolchildren to select a name for the space shuttle that will
replace Challenger, destroyed in an explosion in 1986.
   The agency, in cooperation with the Council of Chief State
School Officers, invited teachers to enter their students in a
national competition to name the orbiter, now being built and
scheduled for its maiden flight in 1992.
   ``The orbiter-naming program responds to a basic human impulse
to name things,'' the announcement said. ``NASA's first orbiters
were named after sea vessels used in research and exploration. The
tradition of naming an orbiter after an exploratory or research sea
vessel will be continued.''
   The three remaining shuttles in the fleet are Discovery,
Atlantis and Columbia.
   NASA said the name Challenger had been retired, in honor of the
seven astronauts killed in the explosion.
   The announcement said the name chosen should not only identify
an American spacecraft but also should capture the spirit of
America's mission in space.
   Announcements of opportunity will be distributed soon to
elementary and secondary teachers and principals. Entry packets
will be available in May.
   ``To enter, elementary and secondary school students will form
teams and research a name,'' NASA said. ``Each team will prepare a
related classroom project to support and justify the name
selected.''
   There will be two entry divisions, covering kindergarten through
the sixth grade and seventh through 12th grades.
   Students in public and private schools in the United States and
U.S. territories, Department of Defense overseas dependents'
schools and Bureau of Indian Affairs schools are eligible.
   Each state, territory and agency will announce one winner in
each division in March 1989. NASA will announce the final winner
for each division and the name selected for the new shuttle in May
1989.

   House leaders reached final agreement today on
a package of $48 million in ``humanitarian'' aid to Nicaragua's
Contra rebels and to children injured in that country's long civil
war.
   The proposal had been worked out in negotiations over the last
two days between House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, Minority Leader
Robert Michel, R-Ill., and other leaders, who gave it their final
approval today.
   Agreement sent the measure to a House floor vote later today,
and it was expected to receive a strong bipartisan majority. That
would send the bill to the Senate on Thursday, where easy passage
also was expected, and authorize the first U.S. aid to the rebels
in a month.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the package was
being examined by the administration but said it was
``encouraging'' and ``moves in the right direction.''
   ``It sends a message to the Contras that they are not abandoned,
that we do care about them and want to keep them healthy and a
viable force,'' said Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., who participated
in negotiations to draft the compromise.
   ``And it lets the Sandinistas know that it's important to the
United States Congress that the talks that take place down there
take place with good faith, and that they move toward
democratization,'' Edwards added.
   As part of the deal, Wright was to send a letter to President
Reagan pledging ``fair and orderly'' consideration for any future
request the administration might make for new military aid if the
Central American peace process breaks down, said Rep. David Bonior,
D-Mich., leader of a Democratic task force on the Contra issue.
   But Wright would retain control over the precise timing of a
vote on such an aid package and the rules under which it would come
before the House, Bonior said.
   A cease-fire verification commission, made up of Nicaraguan
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo and Organization of American States
Secretary General Joao Baena Soares, would have ``substantial'' say
in whether new military aid is warranted, Bonior said.
   The package would provide aid to keep the Contras together while
they spend the next 60 days in cease-fire zones during negotiations
for a longer-term truce.
   It would send about $2.7 million monthly in food, clothing,
medicine and shelter to the rebels over the next six months. An
additional $1.5 million in communications gear, subject to approval
by the cease-fire commission, would push the total six-month rebel
aid package to $17.7 million.
   That rate of aid is the same as the rebels were getting prior to
Feb. 29, when the last U.S. assistance ran out.
   An identical amount would go into a new program to care for
children injured in the seven-year civil war, Bonior said.
   The package also would provide $10 million to finance the
verification commission, set up as part of last week's cease-fire
agreement to ensure adherence to terms of the cease-fire worked out
in Sapoa, Nicaragua, between the Contras and the leftist Managua
government.
   The bill would provide additional money for transportation of
the aid, but that amount was not included in the $50 million figure.
   The money would be administered by the State Department's Agency
for International Development, Bonior said. AID would get $2.5
million in the bill to cover administrative costs.
   One of the most contentious issues in the negotiations was
whether Reagan should be guaranteed the right to a quick,
guaranteed vote in Congress if the Sandinistas renege on promises
of amnesty and restoration of civil liberties, and hostilities
break out anew.
   Republicans, wary of promises made by the leftist government,
had insisted such a guarantee was needed as insurance that the
Sandinistas would live up to their end of the bargain.
   In a compromise, Wright drafted a letter to Reagan assuring the
president of a chance to submit a proposal for new military aid if
the peace process becomes derailed, and to have the proposal
treated fairly.
   That means that the measure would be considered by the
appropriate House committee and could come to the floor for a vote,
but under conditions determined by Wright, said Bonior.
   Reagan would be urged to get the advice of the verification
commission before making any such request, but would not be forced
to do so.
   Any new aid for the Contras would have to conform to the
requirements of the cease-fire reached last week. That agreement
said the Contras would receive only humanitarian aid and that the
aid would be routed through ``neutral organizations.'' The CIA has
delivered past U.S. aid supplies to the rebels.
   In remarks Tuesday in Managua, Nicaraguan President Daniel
Ortega urged Congress not to approve any aid that would conflict
with the agreement, which he defined as allowing provision of
civilian clothes, medicine and food, but not uniforms or boots.

   President Reagan put in a plug for the
superconducting super collider Wednesday, saying it is more than an
``arcane interest'' to a few research specialists.
   Reagan has asked Congress for $365 million to begin construction
of the super collider, which would be the world's largest particle
accelerator.
   The scientific community is divided on the project, some
regarding it as a key to the technological future, and others
saying it would drain needed money from more worthwile research.
   ``I know that some people may question the practical
applications of the superconducting super collider,'' the president
told a group of high school science students and others in the
White House Rose Garden.
   ``The strange world of subatomic particles, they may think, will
never be more than an arcane interest to a few highly specialized
scientists,'' he said.
   ``But the truth is the practical applications of this new
technology are already changing the way we live. Every time someone
turns on his desk computer, makes a phone call or plays a video
game, he is plugging into that mysterious world of quantum physics.
The superconducting super collider is the doorway to that new world
of quantum change.''
   The students in the audience were part of a program established
in 1985 to give top science students from each state a chance to
work for two weeks in the summer at national laboratories in the
Washington area.
   Reagan approved construction of the super collider in January,
1987. A site is to be selected next January in either Arizona,
Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee
or Texas.
   The projected cost to build the 53-miles-around tunnel that
comprises the super collider is more than $4 billion.
   Six Nobel laureates, four of whom were present for Wednesday's
ceremony, wrote Reagan that the project ``represents America's
commitment to the pursuit of excellence in basic scientific
research.''
   The letter was signed by were James Watson Cronin, Val Logsdon
Fitch, Sheldon Lee Glashow, Burton Richter, Samuel C.C. Ting and
Steven Weinberg. All but Fitch and Glashow attended.

   Ex-President Richard Nixon will appear April 10
on the NBC-TV show ``Meet The Press'' for an hour-long interview _
his first extended television appearance in eight years, the
network said Wednesday.
   ``There are no set conditions for the interview,'' said NBC News
Vice President Tim Russert, who had tried to get Nixon on the
weekly program for three years.
   Following the appearance on ``Meet The Press,'' Nixon will
appear in a three-part interview with Bryant Gumbel on NBC's
``Today'' show. Nixon's last long television interview was in 1980
on the ABC-TV program ``20-20.''
   The ``Meet The Press'' taping will be April 9 in Washington,
said NBC spokesman Bill McAndrew. The program will be broadcast
unedited, he said.
   ``Meet The Press'' moderator Chris Wallace will be joined by
anchorman Tom Brokaw and commentator John Chancellor in quizzing
Nixon, who resigned under threat of impeachment in August 1974.
   Nixon will appear live on the April 11 ``Today'' show, with the
following two days featuring taped highlights of his interview with
Gumbel.

time period.
   CBS is facing a third-place finish in the prime-time ratings
this season for the first time ever and was trying to add more
half-hour comedies to its drama-heavy schedule.
   The critically acclaimed ``Frank's Place'' was spared the ax
Tuesday night and will be returned to the schedule shortly, CBS
said. It had been moved from Monday to Tuesday in the schedule
shakeup earlier this month. ``Cagney & Lacey'' will replace
``Wiseguy'' on Monday, but ``Wiseguy'' also will return soon, CBS
said.
   ``Trial and Error,'' ``Coming of Age'' and ``My Sister Sam''
have had their last Tuesday broadcasts, and CBS announced no plans
to bring them back. Those comedies, plus ``Frank's Place'' were the
four lowest-rated network shows in last week's Nielsens.
   CBS will replace the Tuesday lineup with theatrical movies in
the meantime, and the detective series ``Houston Knights'' will
return April 26.

   Democratic presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson
and key members of his party's establishment held a summit meeting
Wednesday, showing, he said, that ``old wineskins are expanding and
making room for new wine.''
   Jackson huddled for a breakfast meeting with more than two dozen
well-known figures in the party. Afterward, they said no one had
brought up reported party concerns that his nomination could damage
Democratic chances of winning the White House next November.
   ``We only see that in the press,'' said California Assembly
Speaker Willie Brown, Jackson's national campaign chairman. ``Maybe
people don't want to say that in front of us.''
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Jackson are locked in a
tight race for the lead in national convention delegates, after a
big Jackson win in the Michigan caucuses last weekend and a Dukakis
victory in the Connecticut primary Tuesday.
   In addition to private concerns about Jackson, another
Democratic contender, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, has begun
strong criticism of Jackson's experience and his stands on issues.
   ``I categorically reject his notion that there's a moral
equivalence between Israel and the PLO,'' Gore said Tuesday in New
York. ``And I am dismayed by his embrace of (PLO leader Yasser)
Arafat and (Cuban President Fidel) Castro.''
   Jackson brushed aside those criticisms, and Gore sought a
meeting with Jackson late Wednesday in Washington before Jackson
was to fly to Wisconsin to campaign for the primary there next
Tuesday.
   After the breakfast meeting, former Defense Secretary Clark
Clifford, one of the solid figures of the party establishment, had
nothing but praise for Jackson.
   ``What he is also doing is bringing a new maturity to the
American political scene,'' said Clifford. ``His candidacy could
not have occurred 50 years ago, 25 years ago, or perhaps even 10
years ago. It is ... an important breakthrough in our constant
seeking to bring more fairness to our political process.''
   Jackson said the breakfast brought ``together Democrats who have
traditional investment in the interests of the country and the
party and those who are new to the process.''
   ``In this instance, we bring together old wineskins and new
wine, but the old wineskins are expanding and making room for new
wine,'' he added, using an image he used frequently in his 1984
campaign.
   Former Democratic Party Chairman John White, who put together
the breakfast, is joining the campaign as an informal adviser.
   ``This meeting is a new maturing of the political process in
America,'' White said. ``It represents a growing-up of America. It
represents a bonding of the Democratic Party and a bond that
recognizes no class.''
   Participants in the breakfast said one concern about Jackson was
posed to him in a question about his relationship with Black Muslim
leader Louis Farrakhan.
   White said Jackson ``quoted Jesus about casting the first stone
and forgiveness and so anybody who hasn't made mistakes ... let's
not be casting stones at each other about the past.''
   Farrakhan campaigned with Jackson early in the 1984 campaign,
but the tie was cut after the Black Muslim leader called Judaism a
``gutter religion'' and called Adolf Hitler ``a great man.''

   McDonnell Douglas Corp. became the Pentagon's
top research contractor in fiscal 1987, winning awards totaling
$1.7 billion, the Defense Department said Wednesday.
   Among educational and non-profit entities, the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology continued to hold down the top ranking,
winning research contracts during the year worth $407.6 million.
   The Johns Hopkins University was close behind with awards
totaling $354.9 million.
   Overall, the Pentagon increased its spending on research by more
than 10 percent during fiscal 1987, with awards reaching a grand
total of $21.8 billion. That compared with $19.8 billion in fiscal
1986.
   Much of last year's increase appeared related to work on
President Reagan's Star Wars anti-missile system. The amount of
money invested in research on ``missile and space systems'' climbed
from $6.9 billion in fiscal 1986 to $7.9 billion in fiscal 1987.
   Moreover, the Martin Marietta Corp. _ a key Star Wars contractor
_ vaulted from fifth place in the fiscal 1986 rankings to second
place last year with contract awards rising from $695.3 million to
$1.6 billion.
   The latest figures are contained in a report prepared annually
by the Pentagon to rank the top 500 companies or non-profit groups
performing ``research, development, test and evaluation'' work. The
rankings are based on a review of all contracts totaling $25,000 or
more awarded during the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30.
   McDonnell Douglas, whose overall ranking as the nation's largest
defense contractor was announced just a month ago, displaced the
Lockheed Missiles & Space Co. in assuming the top spot for
research. McDonnell Douglas' research contracts climbed from $928
million in fiscal 1986 to $1.7 billion in fiscal 1987.
   Because of Martin Marietta's abrupt rise, Lockheed fell to 3rd
place in the research rankings, winning contracts in fiscal 1987
worth $1.54 billion compared with $1.48 billion the year before.
   The remainder of the Top 10 included the Boeing Co. in 4th place
with awards totaling $1.2 billion, followed by the Grumman
Aerospace Corp., $901.5 million; General Electric Co., $784.4
million; Raytheon Co., $593.8 million; TRW Inc., $556.6 million;
Rockwell International Corp., $494 million; and IBM, $470.9 million.
   The $407.6 million in research contracts won by MIT was enough
to give it the 11th place ranking overall. In fiscal 1986, MIT had
won contracts worth $363.9 million and was ranked 14th overall.
   Among other educational and non-profit entities, Johns Hopkins
was 2nd in fiscal 1987 with $354.9 million and a 15th ranking
overall, followed by The Mitre Corp., $347.5 million, 16th overall;
The Aerospace Corp., $338.9 million, 18th overall; and Charles
Stark Draper Lab Inc., $164.7 million, 26th overall.
   All told, the top 500 concerns accounted for 97 percent of the
total research contracts awarded, or $21.2 billion. The top 500
included 380 businesses, 100 educational and non-profit
organizations, three U.S. government agencies and 17 foreign
contractors.
   The research awards to foreign concerns totaled $114.3 million,
up only slightly from the $106.9 million reported in fiscal 1986.
The leading foreign contractor remained the same, the Canadian
Commercial Corp., with awards totaling $25.9 million.

<HEAD>Census-OMB Settle on 1990 Questions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dispute between government agencies over the
questions to be asked on the 1990 Census has been settled, the
Census Bureau reported Wednesday.
   Friday is the deadline for the bureau to tell Congress the
questions it intends to ask Americans in the national head count.
   The issue has been clouded by a disagreement with the White
House Office of Management and Budget. That agency wanted to reduce
paperwork by deleting some questions and reducing the number of
people who get the more complex long form.
   The two agencies have agreed that all 106 million households in
the nation will be sent the short form, while the more detailed
long form will go to 17.7 million. Census had wanted to sent it to
nearly 20 million households, OMB to limit it to 10 million.
   Short form questions on plumbing facilities and condominiums
will be switched to the long form, as OMB suggested. But other
questions will be retained, including the cost of uilities.
   Some things that were asked in the 1980 census will be dropped
in 1990. These include employment five years earlier, marital
history, weeks spent looking for work, number of bathrooms, air
conditioning and heating equipment, presence of an elevator and
type of fuel used for cooking and heating water.

   Once Keith Haring was an outlaw, an artist who
repeatedly was ticketed by police for drawing white chalk stick
figures on black poster advertising boards in subway stations.
   But on Tuesday he was back in the subway, this time with the
blessing of the Transit Authority, which is placing on subway cars
and in stations 5,000 Haring-designed posters that urge young
people to read.
   ``FILL YOUR HEAD WITH FUN! START READING!'' say the posters,
which feature a drawing of a kid's head filled with amusing,

   ``This is great,'' Haring said as he autographed copies of the
poster in a station. ``It's come full circle.''

   The Reagan administration said today it is
considering new sanctions against Panama to force the ouster of
strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega, but it appeared no action was
imminent.
   ``Other sanctions are being actively considered,'' said White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. However, an administration
official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said ``nothing's
imminent.''
   On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, two Republican lawmakers introduced
legislation that calls on President Reagan to renegotiate the
Panama Canal treaties to allow U.S. troops to remain in Panama past
the year 2000.
   The canal treaties negotiated with Panama in 1979 provide for
the transfer of the canal to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.
   The legislation introduced by Rep. Robert Walker of Pennsylvania
and New York Rep. Jerry Solomon would allow independent U.S. action
to defend the canal as well as permit U.S. troops to remain in
Panama past the year 2000.
   Separately, Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, R-N.Y., said today that
Noriega's troops have harassed and beaten canal employees. ``There
is a continuing pattern of escalation'' in Panamanian actions
against the canal, he said in an interview on ABC-TV's ``Good
Morning America.'' He did not elaborate.
   Beyond applying new sanctions, the administration is raising the
prospect that the U.S. military may be used to protect the
estimated 50,000 American citizens in Panama against possible
harassment by that country's security forces.
   Fitzwater appeared to open the door to that possibility Tuesday
after an incident the previous evening in which Panamanian troops
confiscated the tapes of four U.S. television networks and briefly
detained several American journalists.
   Discussing the harassment against Americans, Fitzwater said,
``It has always been a principle that we will protect American
citizens as best we can and, while we have said that we don't plan
to go in militarily, it's also important to note that there are
limits.''
   But when President Reagan met with senior advisers Tuesday
afternoon to discuss the Panama situation, use of military force
was not discussed, according to an administration official who
asked not to be identified.
   The official said other options were discussed for bringing
pressure to bear on Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega,
the de facto head of what the United States considers to be an
illegal government.
   It was not clear whether Fitzwater's comments represented a
genuine re-evaluation of U.S. policy or were part of the continuing
war of nerves between the administration and Panama's
military-dominated government.
   One major deterrent to military intervention is that any such
move would generate a hostile reaction throughout Latin America.
Most delegates attending a conference of Latin American
representatives in Venezuela on Monday and Tuesday called for the
U.S. to exercise restraint.
   In recent days, the administration has been weighing the
possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Panama.
   U.S. officials, who asked not to be identified, said Reagan
could invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which
would give him broad discretionary authority to limit private U.S.
transactions with Panama. One example would be the suspension of
all air service between the two countries.
   Over the past month, administration actions have effectively cut
off the flow of dollars into Panama, leaving the country near
insolvency. Reagan has called on Noriega to step down.
   There was a new sense of urgency here Tuesday over signs of an
accelerating deterioration of the situation in Panama. On Monday,
thousands of anti-government demonstrators were routed by
government forces with the help of shotguns, tear gas and water
cannon. Witnesses said several people were injured and dozens
arrested.
   Later, security agents forced their way at gunpoint into the
offices of four American networks at a local hotel and confiscated
tapes of the demonstration. Eight foreign journalists, including
Americans, were detained for several hours before being released.
   Shortly before Fitzwater spoke, ousted Panamanian President Eric
Arturo Delvalle, whose authority the United States continues to
recognize, appealed for the creation of a U.S.-led international
force to oust Noriega.
   Delvalle, who has spent the past month in hiding, made his
appeal through Panama's ambassador, Juan B. Sosa, who has been
acting as Delvalle's representative in Washington and has refused
to relinquish the embassy to a replacement appointed by Panama's
new government.
   While criticizing the violence used against Panamanian
demonstrators, the focus of the remarks by both Fitzwater and State
Department spokesman Charles Redman was on the harassment of the
American journalists.
   Their comments evoked memories of Grenada when the United States
and several friendly Caribbean nations sent forces into that
country five years ago and ousted the leftist government there.
   The U.S. rationale was that hundreds of American medical
students on the island faced potential danger.
   Fitzwater said, ``We are certainly concerned by this threat to
Americans and find it a very difficult turn of events and one that
is contrary to assurances that we have received in the past.''

<HEAD>Two Disneyland Hotel Workers Fired for Refusing to Shave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Disneyland Hotel employees who opted
for whiskers over work were fired when they reported to their jobs
still sporting facial hair, a violation of new rules.
   Mike Searles, a hotel engineer who has a walrus-style mustache,
and Mike Ferrington, a bartender who wears a beard, gave the hotel
no choice, Disneyland spokesman Bob Roth said Tuesday.
   Searles had worked at the hotel for more than 10 years, Roth
said. He was unaware how long Ferrington had worked there.
   The Walt Disney Co. bought the hotel, across the street from
Disneyland, from the Wrather Corp. in January. With the purchase
came a dress and appearance code for the hotel's 1,600 employees.
   The code, established for Disneyland employees in 1957, requires
men to be clean shaven and keep their hair short. Men cannot wear
gold chains or earrings or have visible tattoos. It also prohibits
women from having long fingernails or wearing eyeshadow.
   Searles and Ferrington were among six hotel employees suspended
last week for three days without pay and told they would be fired
if they didn't shave. Two have complied and two others also face
dismissal, Roth said,
   At least 12 male hotel employees have filed union grievances.
The five unions have vowed to fight the rule.

   William Ball was sworn in Wednesday as the
nation's 67th secretary of the Navy, pledging to keep his forces
``strong and prepared'' to meet any challenge.
   Standing in an ornate Old Executive Office Building room first
used by Navy Secretary Richard Thompson in 1879, Ball said that by
maintaining military strength, the United States ``preserve the
peace and ultimately extend the special gift that is freedom the
world over.''
   President Reagan, making remarks at the swearing-in ceremony for
his former legislative liaison, said Ball had ``won the respect of
the leaders of both parties.'' He said ``I've repeatedly turned''
to Ball for help and advice in recent years.
   White House chief of staff Howard Baker swore in Ball as several
Cabinet officers, members of Congress and military officers looked
on. After Thompson, who served under President Rutherford B. Hayes,
14 Navy secretaries used the room, heavily decorated in naval motif.
   ``Will takes over the Navy at a critical time,'' Reagan told the
audience. ``The defense budget (requested by the administration)
has now been cut for four consecutive years. And yet we must
maintain the gains this administration has made in rebuilding our
naval and military capabilities. The 600-ship Navy remains our
goal.''
   Ball, 39, succeeds James Webb, who resigned in a dispute with
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci over Pentagon budgetary
priorities, including a delay in reaching the 600-ship level for
the Navy.
   Reagan said ``Will's job will be to skipper our naval forces
through some troubled waters while keeping our Navy and Marine
Corps team second to none.''
   ``Keeping re-enlistments high and the quality of our recruits
the best it's ever been, will be Will's other big assignment,'' he
said.
   In brief remarks, Ball noted that he had recently visited the
USS Coral Sea, which had just returned after six months of duty in
the Mediterranean Sea with the U.S. 6th Fleet.
   ``On that great ship, I was immediately able to see one of the
many legacies that you will leave to history,'' Ball told the
president.
   ``It is indeed written on the faces of those Coral Sea sailors,
in their spirit and their dedication. ... It signifies what you
have done ... for our seagoing people, who are proud once again.''

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III, the subject
of a still widening criminal investigation, ought to step down, two
senators said today but President Reagan said of Meese: ``I have
every confidence in him.''
   Meese is ``the crown jewel of the sleaze factor in Reagan
administration history,'' Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd told
reporters and if Reagan doesn't want to ask him to quit he should
find someone else to ask him.
   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., echoed Byrd: ``You finally reach a
place where there is a cloud of suspicion, a sufficient cloud of
suspicion, that I think you owe it to the president to remove
yourself.''
   But Reagan, almost in reply, told reporters during a ceremony
honoring young scientists in the White House Rose Garden, ``He's
been a friend for over 20 years. I have every confidence in him.
... I'm not going to comment any further.''
   Meese has said he won't step down and he repeated that assertion
as he left his office Tuesday night.
   Meese's future became a subject of speculation and debate in the
aftermath of the resignations of two top Justice Department aides
who acted, according to informed sources, out of fear of being
tainted by the attorney general's mounting legal problems. The
sources declined to be identified.
   Then came a new development, with the disclosure that
independent counsel James McKay has widened his probe by
subpoenaing payroll records and other documents of the Washington
chapter of the Multiple Sclerosis Society in connection with a
$40,000-a-year job Meese's wife, Ursula, got with the group in 1985.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today Reagan saw no
need for Meese to step aside in light of the resignations of
Associate Attorney General Arnold Burns and William Weld, head of
the Justice Department's criminal division, and four of their top
aides.
   Another top Justice Department official, Solicitor General
Charles Fried, said the resignations were leading him to reconsider
his own future at the Justice Department.
   Fitzwater said that Reagan has not has any discussion with Meese
about the leadership vacuum at Justice, ``that I am aware of.''
   ``Operations will continue at the Justice Department,''
Fitzwater said. ``No change that I am aware of (is in progress).
The Justice Department is operating fine. People are out there
doing their job. He (Reagan) thinks the Justice Department is
operating just fine.''
   Fitzwater also declined to comment on Byrd's call for Meese's
resignation.
   ``He ought to get out,'' Byrd, D-W.Va., said. ``The country
cannot have confidence in the Justice Department when the top law
enforcement officer obviously has to spend an inordinate amount of
his time defending himself.''
   ``He should be spending his time fighting the war on drugs,
crime,'' Byrd said.
   Byrd opened his regular morning meeting with reporters by
saying: ``Mr. Meese has become the crown jewel of the sleaze factor
in Reagan administration history.''
   ``It's just cloud after cloud after cloud, building in layers
over his head to the point where all confidence in this agency is
being seriously eroded,'' Byrd said.
   Washington attorney James Bierbower, legal counsel for the
Multiple Sclerosis Society and a board member, said the records
concerning Mrs. Meese's job were delivered to McKay's office on
Monday.
   The independent counsel is trying to determine whether longtime
Meese friend E. Robert Wallach used his influence to help get Mrs.
Meese the job, said several sources familiar with the probe,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Carl Levin, D-Mich., demanded
that Meese explain why Burns, Weld and four of their aides abruptly
quit on Tuesday. Specter, a member of the Judiciary Committee, said
it may be necessary to convene hearings if an explanation is not
forthcoming.
   Burns and Weld offered little in the way of public explanation,
but they told associates they were concerned that the nearly
year-long criminal probe of Meese is hurting the entire Justice
Department, according to several department sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Weld, who as an assistant attorney general oversees all federal
criminal investigations, told assistants at a final staff meeting
that the continuing investigation of Meese and Wallach was casting
a ``cloud'' on the Justice Department, according to several
department sources.
   Weld quit as of the close of business Tuesday, telling his staff
he didn't want to get in ``50 fights'' and have ``blood on the
floor,'' said the sources. Burns will stay on until April 22.
   Meese did not learn the two were quitting until Burns and Weld
walked into his office Tuesday morning and informed him of the
decision. Several department sources characterized Meese as
``shocked.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater confirmed that Burns and
Weld had met with White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker a week
earlier. ``The gentlemen indicated they wanted to resign, or they
were disenchanted, and they were advised to talk to the attorney
general about that. That's the proper way to do it, the proper
course of action,'' Fitzwater said.
   Asked if Reagan had been told about the conversation, Fitzwater
said, ``I don't believe so.'' He said he was not aware of any
subsequent talks between Baker and the two officials.
   Meese has been under investigation for nearly 11 months by
McKay, the independent counsel who last May 11 began looking into
Meese's involvement with the scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp.
   The investigation later expanded to include his involvement in a
$1 billion Iraqi pipeline project, with the independent counsel
trying to determine whether Meese may have been paid off by Wallach
or others in exchange for helping Wedtech or the pipeline project.
   Regarding the new area in the Meese probe, Wallach's lawyer, San
Francisco attorney George Walker, was quoted in today's Post as
saying Wallach played a ``peripheral'' role in getting Mrs. Meese
the job at the MS society.
   However, Bierbower said the idea for hiring Mrs. Meese came from
the chapter's executive director, Jeanne Bradley, who was pleased
with Mrs. Meese's volunteer work.
   Walker said Wallach had ``suggested the possibility'' of the
radio job, and Bierbower said a foundation run by the family that
owns the station ended up paying Mrs. Meese's $40,000 salary for
the MS society job she took instead.
   One Justice Department source said Weld has frequently expressed
an interest in returning to Massachusetts to seek political office,
and didn't want to be associated with the department because of
Meese's continuing legal problems.
   Weld, a former U.S. attorney in Boston who has prosecuted a
number of important public corruption and white-collar crime cases,
is widely mentioned as a potential Republican gubernatorial
candidate. He also has said he wants to run for the U.S. Senate,
the source said.

   The four stars of NBC's ``Golden Girls'' were
nominated Wednesday for the second annual American Comedy Awards to
be presented on ABC in May.
   Actresses Bea Arthur, Estelle Getty, Rue McClanahan and Betty

   Tracey Ullman, who stars in her own show on Fox Broadcasting,
was the fifth nominee in the funniest female performer category.
   In addition, Miss White was nominated for a lifetime achievement

<TEXT>
   After searching three years for his son,
Gerald Murphy finally met him only hours before the 21-year-old was
sentenced to life in prison for murder.
   Murphy said he was a college student in 1967 when his girlfriend
became pregnant and gave the child up for adoption.
   ``Today was the first time I made any physical contact with him
_ to reach out and shake  Murphy on Monday, after
the Anne Arundel County Circuit Court sentenced Michael Gregory
Woods to life in prison without parole. Woods was convicted of
first-degree murder Jan. 19.
   ``What a tragic thing this is. I fehis hand,'' saidel deprived in a
sense, but
I'm glad I answered the question of what happened to him,'' Murphy
said.
   On July 2, Woods shot and killed Michael Boyd, a 25-year-old
National Security Agency employee.
   Boyd's wife Jody claimed her husband beat her and their three
children. She asked Woods, a friend of hers, to kill her husband.
   In return, she promised to give him and his two teen-age
conspirators her husband's $25,000 life insurance, according to
court testimony.
   Michael Woods was the first man in Maryland to receive the
life-in-prison- without-parole sentence. It went into effect July
1, the day before the murder.
   Murphy, 46, who has a wife and three children in California,
flew from his home in Loworkbooks and
sandwiches in an increasing number of school backpacks each day. It
is a pill, no bigger than button candy, prescribed to help
hyperactive youngsters get through their multiplication tables,
spelling tests and geography lessons. Some parents describe Ritalin
as a godsend, but its success may be leading to its excess. As many
as 1 million children may take the drug, and happy results
encourage more doctors to prescribe it, sometimes with less
triumphant results.

<HEAD>Nuclear Plant Restarted After 27-Month Shutdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER McNULTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rancho Seco nuclear power plant, shut
down for 27 months, was restarted today after plant officials
received final approval from the federal Nuclear Regulatory
Commission.
   An electronically transmitted letter from the NRC approving the
restart arrived at 6:53 a.m., said Kerry Shearer, a spokesman for
the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, which owns the plant 25
miles southeast of Sacramento.
   The letter was in response to an official approval request sent
by the authority to Washington on Tuesday.
   Authority nuclear chief Carl Andognini ordered restart of the
plant at 7:04 a.m., Shearer said. Starting up the plant will take
eight to 10 hours.
   ``We're obviously very, very happy to have come to this point
after 27 months of effort,'' said Shearer.
   The plant, whose reactor is a twin of the Three Mile Island
reactor in Pennsylvania, has been closed since a severe overcooling
accident in December 1985.
   The startup process will be completed later Wednesday when
operators finish diluting the amount of boron in the reactor's
cooling water and withdraw control rods, Shearer said.
   ``The combination brings the reactor to the point where the
nuclear chain reaction is self-sustaining,'' he said. Officials
call that milestone ``criticality'' and plan to operate the reactor
for 10 to 14 days before beginning to produce electricity.
   On Tuesday morning, operators finished testing repairs made to
the plant's electrical system over the weekend. A valve problem and
excessive vibration in two back-up diesel generators were also
fixed over the weekend.
   But opposition to the plant has grown during the long series of
restart delays. A majority of the Sacramento City Council,
including Mayor Anne Rudin, and at least one county supervisor have
announced support for a June ballot measure calling for the plant's
closure.
   A citizen-sponsored initiative calls for immediate shutdown of
the plant. A competing SMUD-sponsored measure asks voters to
approve operation of the plant for at least 18 months.
   The utility has spent more than $400 million during the past 27
months to overhaul equipment and management at the plant, which has
generated an average of only 40 percent of the electricity it was
designed to produce since it was opened in 1975.
   Michael Remy, director of the group sponsoring the plant closure
initiative, said the utility was under pressure to restart the
plant because a major delay could diminish public support for the
facility.

   Gov. Evan Mecham's son lied in his
testimony on an impeachment allegation that the governor misused
$80,000 from his protocol fund by loaning it to his auto
dealership, the company's former bookkeeper told the Senate today.
   Dennis Mecham, general manager of Mecham Pontiac, said last week
that the dealership was in ``very strong'' financial shape, but
former bookkeeper Lee Christman testified today that the company
actually needed hundreds of thousands of dollars when it borrowed
the $80,000 in July 1987.
   On Tuesday, Dennis Mecham announced that the dealership was
being sold because of lagging sales blamed on bad publicity that
has dogged his father since he took office in January 1987.
   Asked today by defense lawyer Jerris Leonard whether she
contacted prosecutors on her own initiative, Ms. Christman
answered, ``Yes, when I heard Dennis lie.''
   Leonard immediately objected, and the presiding officer said Ms.
Christman's answer went beyond what the question sought.
   Later, Ms. Christman told prosecutor William French she was
upset with Dennis Mecham because she felt he had blamed her for
things that were not her fault.
   Democratic Sen. Jesus ``Chuy'' Higuera, then asked if there were
other instances in which she believed the governor and his son had
not told the truth.
   ``They were misstating various facts which would lead one to
believe that the inefficiencies were in the accounting office,
rather than the fact that there was a lack of money,'' Ms.
Christman said.
   French asked Ms. Christman, ``Was there an immediate need for
cash in July 1987?''
   ``Yes, there was,'' she answered. She said Dennis Mecham had
told her the company needed $497,000 in cash flow, and that he
called her to his office and handed her an $80,000 check.
   ``Did he use the word `protocol fund?''' French said. ``Yes,''
she answered.
   Ms. Christman worked for Mecham Pontiac from November 1986 to
February 1988, when she said she was asked to resign because
someone else was hired to handle the computer.
   The financial condition of Mecham Pontiac has been a central
issue in the charge that Mecham miused the protocol fund by loaning
to $80,000 to the dealership. The charge is the second of three
impeachment charges against him.
   After the prosecution finished its case with rebuttal testimony
from Ms. Christman and another witness, the Senate was expected to
consider whether to vote on the first two impeachment articles,
even though no testimony has been heard during the month-long trial
on the third charge _ that Mecham concealed a $350,000 campaign
loan.
   A vote to convict the first-term Republican governor would
automatically remove him from office.
   Dennis Mecham said Tuesday, ``The confusion and questions this
avalanche of negative publicity has caused ... has forced my family
to come to this decision to sell Mecham Pontiac while the condition
of the company remains solvent and saleable.''
   Mecham also faces a May 17 recall election spurred in part by
actions and comments that critics have considered slurs against
blacks, Jews, homosexuals and the Japanese.
   Oldsmobile dealer Kemp Biddulph, whose dealership is next door
to Mecham's in suburban Glendale, said he hoped to close the
purchase by May 1.
   In the impeachment trial, the prosecution claims the dealership
desperately needed the $80,000 loan to meet its payroll in July
1987, but that the governor's protocol fund, which was derived from
inaugural proceeds, was public money.
   The defense claims, however, that the dealership was in good
financial shape at the time of the loan, which was intended to
provide higher interest to the protocol fund. Defense witnesses
have insisted the fund was private money.
   Last week, a motion to allow an immediate vote on the first
impeachment charge that the governor tried to thwart an
investigation of an alleged death threat by a state official was
withdrawn when many senators voiced opposition.
   The third impeachment charge is also the subject of the
governor's April 21 criminal trial, and Mecham has insisted that
allowing the Senate to hear testimony on that charge might
jeopardize his chances of a fair trial.
   Some senators have said they do not want to run the risk of
forcing the criminal charges to be thrown out. Others, however,
including Majority Leader Bob Usdane, a Republican, have insisted
lawmakers should hear evidence on all three charges before voting
on any of them.
   Also on Tuesday, a Maricopa County Superior Court judge refused
to dismiss the criminal charges against Mecham. The defense had
claimed the governor was a victim of selective prosecution and was
charged under the wrong law.
   Judge Michael Ryan also refused to separate the governor's case
from that of co-defendant Willard Mecham, his brother and 1986
campaign treasurer.
   Elsewhere, opening arguments were expected this afternoon in the
political extortion trial of Mecham's former aide, Sam Steiger.

   President Reagan said he sent 3,200
crack U.S. troops because Honduras was in trouble, but reports of
border fighting with Nicaragua were vague and the Americans had
orders to stay out of it.
   Reagan said he was supporting an ally and warning the
Sandinistas. Skeptics in Washington and Tegucigalpa said the
purpose was to drum up aid for Nicaraguan rebels, which Congress
had rejected.
   Arrival of the first American troops March 17 coincided with
reports from Washington that Nicaragua had built up a force of
4,500 troops in the Bocay border region.
   They said up to 2,000 Sandinista soldiers with Soviet-made
artillery and aircraft had crossed into the jungles of eastern
Honduras, pursuing Contra rebels, and President Jose Azcona Hoyo
was asking for help.
   High-ranking Honduran military sources said about 4,000
Hondurans had surrounded the 2,000 Nicaraguans but no fighting was
reported. They said Honduras was sending more troops to the region.
   No casualty figures were reported during the crisis, which began
March 15 and lasted 10 days. Nicaragua said its soldiers did not
cross the border.
   Now that the men of the 82nd Airborne Division and the 7th Light
Infantry Division have gone home, questions remain about the
display of American might.
   The Reagan administration said the soldiers would conduct
exercises in a show of force designed as a measured response to the
crisis. Some of them trained 40 miles from the border and 70 miles
from where fighting was said to have occurred.
   Azcona said in a March 18 news conference that he counted on
support from the United States in case of more Sandinista
aggression. His press secretary, Lisandro Quesada, then told The
Associated Press in an interview: ``This is nothing more than an
exercise in case Honduras enters into war.''
   Gen. Policarpo Paz Garcia, a former Honduran chief of state,
said this week: ``I think the Sandinistas did not intend to invade
Honduran territory. What happened is that Nicaraguan troops were in
pursuit of the Contras and committed the error.''
   Paz, who governed in 1979-1981 before civilian rule was
restored, said the Honduran army ``is prepared to repel any
aggression. ... I wouldn't have asked the United States for
soldiers.'' He spoke in a radio interview broadcast Tuesday.
   According to a survey published Wednesday in El Heraldo, 42 per
cent of Tegucigalpa residents polled agreed with the U.S. decision
to sent troops and 47 percent opposed it.
   As the white parachutes of hundreds of American paratroopers
filled the sky over Palmerola air base March 17, the Reagan
decision was being challenged here and in Washington.
   It came when the Sandinistas and U.S.-supported Contra rebels
had announced plans for direct cease-fire negotiations in Nicaragua.
   Although there were charges that the U.S. troops were sent as a
ploy to get more Contra aid, Azcona told The AP he asked for help
because his country was in danger.
   On Monday, he said in a telephone conversation: ``At no time
were there pressures from the United States that my government ask
for help (with) the incursion of Sandinista troops in our
territory.''
   Honduran congressmen said at the time that they were not
informed of a Sandinista incursion and learned through the news
media that Azcona had requested help.
   Newspapers published editorial cartoons questioning the
operation.
   La Prensa depicted Uncle Sam telling Azcona and other leaders:
``There's an invasion in Honduras'' while they looked around
saying, ``Where, where, where?''
   Ruben Palma, president of the small opposition Christian
Democratic Party, declared: ``The United States is provoking a
direct confrontation betwen Nicaragua and Honduras with the
strategic aim of obtaining aid for the anti-Sandinista
counterrevolutionaries.''
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua said the same.
   Despite denials from Managua of an incursion, U.S. congressmen
on a fact-finding mission in Honduras said they had proof.
   A well-informed source in Tegucigalpa said the Sandinistas
pursued about 600 rebels into Honduras and nearly captured a Contra
supply depot before two bombing raids by the Honduran air force
drove them back.
   ``The presence of the United States troops was beneficial for
Honduras _ for our people and for the national security,'' Azcona
said as the first Americans left for home Monday.
   The last of the Sandinistas had retreated into Honduras by
Thursday of last week, the day after Ortega's government and Contra
leadership signed a preliminary cease-fire agreement.
   Azcona expressed support for peace efforts in Nicaragua.
   ``We're friends of dialogue and peace,'' he said. ``If the
Nicaraguan want to reach an agreement and there are no more shots
or conflicts in our neighboring country, then the Hondurans will be
the first to benefit.''

<TEXT>
   Theodore Picou, a jazz saxophonist and composer
who toured internationally with his musical groups, has died of
lung cancer. He was 53.
   Picou, who died Sunday at his home, is credited with teaching
and influencing many saxophonists, including Harold Land, Herman
Riley and Charles Owens, relatives said.
   Picou was born in Calexico, Calif., on April 19, 1934. His
parents were Creole, from the New Orleans area, and French and
Creole music influenced the family, said his sister, Cecile.
   Picou's family moved to San Diego when he was a child, and he
began taking music lessons at 4. His mother bought him his first
saxophone, and he was playing publicly by age 13.
   Teddy Picou and His Jazz Quartet were playing locally until
recent weeks. His last recording was ``Experience,'' which featured
his own compositions.
   With his quartet and another group, Ted Picou and His Band, he
toured Africa and Europe as well as the United States.
   Survivors include his former wife, Bernestine Picou of San
Diego, two sons, a daughter and his mother. Services were scheduled
Thursday.

   The army on Wednesday padlocked the Arab-owned
Palestine Press Service, cutting off a key source of information in
a campaign to curtail media coverage of Arab unrest in the occupied
territories.
   The news service, which reports on activities in the West Bank
and Gaza Stip, was ordered closed for six months.
   ``We were just too efficient. That's what we got closed down
for,'' reporter John Mellor told The Associated Press.
   In another slap against the media, the Supreme Court rejected a
foreign press appeal for access to the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
which have been closed since Monday. But the judges ordered the
government to explain within 30 days why reporters should not be
allowed free access to the areas.
   The moves indicated the importance Israel attaches to curbing
news coverage. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and other government
officials have accused the media of fueling nearly four months of
violence in the occupied territories.
   The army said journalists would be prosecuted if found violating
the access ban, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in
jail.
   Lawrence Grossman, president of NBC News, rejected the
government view that a media presence had aggravated the problems.
   ``There hasn't been a single killing of an Arab when the cameras
are there,'' Grossman said in an interview with the Jerusalem Post.
   He added that Israel was ``putting itself in the least favorable
imaginable position in view of South Africa's reputation.'' In
South Africa, police have the right to close an area to journalists
at a moment's notice.
   Israeli officials have been particularly sensitive about
comparisons of Israel's treatment of Palestinians with the
treatment of blacks in South Africa. In that country, the black
majority has no voice in national affairs.
   The order against the Palestine Press Service, signed by West
Bank commander Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna and taped on the agency's
door, said the closure was ``necessary for maintaining public
safety and public order.''
   Army troops ordered agency staffers out of the office and placed
two large padlocks on the doors. In defiance, the agency clamped on
two padlocks of its own.
   ``It's a horrible day. The army has now made the blackout in the
occupied territories complete,'' the agency's publisher, Ibrahim
Kareen, told The AP. He said four of his staffers have been
arrested since unrest began Dec. 8.
   The army has arrested more than a dozen Arab journalists who
have acted as interpreters for foreign reporters.
   The order, the first ever against the 11-year-old agency, was
authorized under 1945 emergency regulations imposed by the British
in pre-Israel Palestine.
   Kareen said officials told him they were closing the agency in
part because Israel believed it received funding from the Palestine
Liberation Organization. Kareen denied PLO funding and said the
real reason for the closure was that his agency provided tips to
journalists about Palestinian deaths or injuries far more quickly
than the army.
   The Supreme Court heard 2{ hours of arguments Wednesday on an
appeal from the Foreign Press Association, which sought a reversal
of Monday's order closing the occupied territories until early
Friday.
   Yisrael Leshem, an attorney for the association, argued the
closure order was a blow to freedom of the press and set a
dangerous precedent.
   ``If the army makes this condition now, what's to stop them from
banning coverage of any event?'' Leshem said. He criticized as
insufficient pool coverage arrangements offered to journalists who
went in with an army escort.
   A military officer argued the army arrangements actually helped
reporters by protecting them from demonstrators.
   Although the closure order remained in effect, Robert Slater,
president of the Foreign Press Association, said he considered the
decision ``a great victory'' because the government was required to
explain its decision.
   ``We weren't fighting for five minutes or 10 minutes in the
territories,'' Slater said. ``We were fighting for the principle.
This order sends a clear signal to the army that in the near future
we should be permitted to enter the territories freely.''

   President Corazon Aquino and military
officials claimed a major victory over communist rebels Wednesday
after the capture of the rebel army's leader and the Communist
Party's No. 2 man.
   Romulo Kintanar, commander of the New People's Army, and Rafael
Baylosis, secretary-general of the Communist Party of the
Philippines, were captured in raids Tuesday, along with the rebel
army's logistics officer and another high-ranking party member,
officials said.
   Mrs. Aquino hailed the arrests as ``happy news for our country''
and commended Armed Forces Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa and
other officers.
   ``It clearly demonstrates that we have turned the tide and are
winning the war against the communist insurgency,'' she said. ``The
fact that they were arrested on the NPA's 19th anniversary attests
to the admirable performance of our Armed Forces of the
Philippines. I am elated and so is our citizenry.''
   The 24,000-strong NPA is in its 20th year of a violent struggle
for power. The military was on a heightened state of alert in
Manila in anticipation of rebel attacks marking the anniversary.
   Kintanar had long been wanted by the military. Besides heading
the NPA, he is widely believed to be the chief organizer of
communist assassination squads known as ``Sparrow Units'' because
of the swiftness of their attacks.
   The squads have been blamed for killing more than 150 police
officers and soldiers on Manila streets since last year.
   ``The rebels are now demoralized,'' Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano,
Philippine Constabulary chief, declared at a reception for retiring
military officers.
   Montano said Kintanar initially gave authorities a false name
and it was not until much later that they realized who he really
was.
   The others arrested with him and Baylosis were Benjamin de Vera,
the Central Committee member in charge of operations on Mindanao
island; NPA logistics officer Napoleon Manuel; Manuel's wife, Inez;
Kintanar's wife, Gloria; and Marco Palo, a party liaison officer.
   Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos described the arrests as a
``big blow'' to the communists and attributed their capture to a
unified and more efficient military.
   But Brig. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, Manila's military commander,
warned that the rebels were far from paralyzed.
   ``It will disturb some of their programs,'' Biazon said. ``But
to say that this is defeat for the Communist movement may not
entirely be correct because we are fighting an idea, and the idea
is still there.''
   Biazon said he expected more arrests soon.
   Brig. Gen. Honesto Isleta, a military spokesman, said troops
``almost captured'' party chairman Benito Tiamzon. Isleta declined
to elaborate.
   The official Philippine News Agency said Tiamzon had been tipped
off about the arrests of his comrades in the Manila suburb of San
Juan and was gone when troops arrived at his hideout in suburban
Quezon City.

   Police clashed with about 250
stone-throwing Moslem fundamentalists who attacked a theater
troupe, a security source said Wednesday. One student was killed
and four were injured as officers dispersed the crowd.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
incident took place Tuesday night at the village of Kodeya, 25
miles from the southern provincial capital of Assiut.
   He said it wasn't known what killed 23-year-old Mohammed Kotb.
One of the four wounded students was in critical condition, he
added.
   In a statement read to The Associated Press by telephone, a
fundamentalist spokesman claimed the student was killed by police
gunfire.
   ``The Moslem group went out through the village in a peaceful
march of protest ... when police attacked them with tear gas and
opened fire on the demonstrators, killing the student Mohammed
Kotb,'' the statement said.
   The spokesman, who refused to give his name, said forces then
surrounded the village, raided homes and detained fundamentalists.
   The spokesman said the students were protesting a ``dancing
party'' organized by security forces.
   The security source, however, said the fundamentalists attacked
a theater troupe performing a play about Islam and peasants. The
troup had been invited to perform by the government's culture club
at the village.
   ``Around 250 Moslem fundamentalists from the village and nearby
villages gathered in a mosque after evening prayers and then moved
to the hall where the play was being performed, carrying stones and
rocks,'' the source said.
   He said the students, from a teacher training college,
``attacked the hall and tried to destroy the building,'' but
security forces surrounded them and used tear gas and sticks to
disperse them. He did not say whether police made any arrests.
   Police forces guarded the building until the play was finished,
the source said.
   The southern Assiut province has been a hotbed of fundamentalist
agitation for almost a decade.
   Fundamentalist students armed with knives, bicycle chains and
stones, attacked an Assiut University campus parade on March 7,
denouncing it as an anti-Islamic ``dancing and singing party.'' In
the ensuing clash with security forces, two students and two
policemen were wounded.

   A fire apparently started by candles in an

authorities said.
   Firefighters backed a fire truck through an eight-foot fence and
smashed aside a car to get to a shaft where they raised a ladder
and rescued people through fourth- and fifth-floor windows, said
fire Capt. Ed Brown.
   The fire in the South Bronx, reported at 1:39 a.m., broke out on
the third floor and extended through the fourth and fifth and into
the roof, Brown said.
   The baby who died was identified as Chantel Nelson, 4 months.
Firefighters found her father unconscious and rescued him, Brown
said.
   Two firefighters who tried to get to the baby's apartment were
seriously injured and hospitalized, said Deputy Fire Chief Joseph
DiBernado.
   Department spokesman John Mulligan said marshals did not
immediately declare a cause of the fire but said it probably was
due to carelessness with candles. Electricity and gas had been off
for more than a month in the apartment, he said.
   Ten of 15 injured firefighters and five residents went to
hospitals, said Mark Rothstein of the Emergency Medical Services.
Most suffered smoke inhalation, said Mulligan.
   He said 10 families were driven out by the fire.

<HEAD>Brother Of Former President Arrested On Corruption And
Embezzlement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The younger brother of former
President Chun Doo-hwan was arrested early Thursday on corruption
and embezzlement charges in connection with a multimillion-dollar
financial scandal, prosecutors said.
   Court sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said warrants
for the arrest of Chun Kyung-hwan and three of his aides and
associates were issued shortly after midnight.
   The warrants were executed later Thursday.
   Thursday's arrests brought to nine the number of suspects in
custody in the scandal involving the semi-official Saemaul
development movement.
   Earlier, five suspects, including two of Chun Kyung-hwan's
brothers-in-law, were jailed Tuesday on charges of embezzlement and
fraudulent land sales.
   All nine are either Saemaul officials or former leading members
of the nationwide organization.
   Prosecutors said the younger Chun, who led Saemaul between 1981
and 1987, embezzled at least $9.3 million and built up a fortune in
land, stocks and business interest.
   Senior Prosecutor Kang Won-il, who has headed the investigation,
said Wednesday the younger Chun would initially face six charges,
including corruption, embezzlement, tax evasion and violation of
laws governing special economic and financial crimes.
   If convicted, Chun faces punishments ranging from 10 years in
prison to the death sentence.
   ``We have enough evidence to incriminate them,'' Kang said after
questioning the four men for more than 36 hours.
   Chun Doo-hwan, who has not been implicated in the scandal, is on
a private tour of the United States. He met with President Reagan
at the White House last week.
   Opposition parties are demanding that he return to Seoul
immediately to explain his role in the scandal. Opposition leaders
have charged that the former president was involved in the affair.
   Saemaul, founded in 1971 to promote urban and rural development,
evolved into a powerful organization involved in activities ranging
from building model communities to promoting urban clean-up
campaigns.
   Prosecutors say the younger Chun, who was appointed to head the
group by President Chun in 1981, used his position to divert
government and private donations, sell influence and pressure
businesses to make gifts of money, land and stocks.
   He resigned as Saemaul chief in 1987 after being linked to
organized crime. He fled to Japan April 18 when news of the
government probe surfaced, but returned two days later to face
questioning.
   During the inquiry, about 200 government officials and business
leaders have been questioned about corruption and a possible
coverup to protect former President Chun and his family. None of
them has been formally implicated.
   However, prosecution sources said Wednesday night that more
people might be charged.
   The Chun administration has long been suspected of widespread
corruption. But during its authoritarian administration, criticism
of the president and his family were not tolerated and allegations
of corruption were routinely ignored.
   President Roh Tae-woo, who took power Feb. 25, is thought to
have supported the Saemaul investigation to discredit the former
president and end his attempts to retain power and influence within
the government.
   Some Chun royalists were purged from the governing Democratic
Justice Party earlier this month, and Roh blocked the former
president's attempts to retain substantial power as a government
adviser.
   Roh, a former general who helped put Chun in power with military
backing in 1980, promised during the presidential election campaign
last year to root out and end official corruption.

<HEAD>Factory Orders Down for Second Month, But Analysts Not Alarmed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured
goods fell for the second month in a row in February, but analysts
said the 0.8 percent decline was not a cause for alarm.
   The Commerce Department said Wednesday that orders for durable
and non-durable goods dropped to a seasonally adjusted $210.86
billion last month following a 0.6 percent decline in January.
   The February setback was the biggest since a 1.4 percent drop
last August and marked the first time that factory orders have
fallen for two consecutive months since the summer of 1986.
   Economists said the declines showed that businesses did cut back
on orders in the early part of the year in an effort to trim high
levels of unsold goods that had built up in the final three months
of 1987.
   While this process will dampen growth, economists said it
appeared that the cutbacks had been moderate and would set the
stage for faster growth in the months ahead.
   ``The economy is expanding at a moderate pace. We are not
looking for either a boom or a bust,'' said Bruce Steinberg, an
economist with Merrill Lynch in New York. ``Although we had
declines in orders in the past two months, those declines came off
a very high level of demand in the fourth quarter.''
   Even with the two months of declines, total factory orders were
8.3 percent higher than a year earlier, reflecting the strong
growth in manufacturing demand in 1987. Analysts also noted that
the backlog of unfilled orders continued to grow in February,
rising by 0.8 percent to $412.3 billion, indicating production will
have to remain high to fill those orders.
   Economists expect manufacturing to be one of the major sources
of strength for the economy this year as American companies
continue to benefit from a weaker dollar, which has made their
products competitive again on world markets.
   This export boom is expected to spur U.S. companies to boost
their investment spending plans for new plant and equipment,
further adding to overall economic growth.
   However, the February report said the key category of
non-defense capital goods fell 3.9 percent, although the sector was
still 23 percent higher than a year ago. This category is
considered a good gauge of business spending plans on capital
equipment.
   Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist for the National Association
of Manufacturers, said the weakness in stock prices and fears about
higher inflation rates may be causing some companies to lower their
investment spending somewhat.
   The February decline in factory orders included a drop of 1.1
percent in orders for durable goods. These items, expected to last
three or more years, fell to a seasonally adjusted $118.5 billion
last month. An advance report last week had put the decline in
those orders at a sharper 1.8 percent.
   Orders for non-durable goods fell 0.4 percent in February to
$97.9 billion.
   Orders for military equipment fell 8.2 percent to $8.4 billion
last month, but military demand was still 14 percent higher than a
year ago. Without the drop in defense orders, total orders would
have fallen by a slightly smaller 0.5 percent in February.
   Orders for transportation equipment were one of the few areas of
strength last month, climbing 3.5 percent to $30 billion. The
aircraft component showed a 6.8 percent increase.
   Orders for primary metals, such as steel, edged up 1.4 percent
and were 26 percent higher than a year earlier.
   Orders for electrical machinery fell 7.4 percent, while orders
for non-electrical machinery were off 5.4 percent.
   Shipments of manufactured goods edged up 0.1 percent in February
to $207.4 billion.

<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III told
Congress on Wednesday that he strongly disagrees with proposals to
forgive some of the Third World's debt, now over $1 trillion.
   ``I believe this path leads both debtors and creditors off the
cliff,'' he said. ``This approach would irreparably politicize the
debt problem.''
   Forgiveness would distract both debtors and creditors from the
need to make reforms, encourage repudiation of debt and shift the
risk on bank loans to taxpayers, including U.S. taxpayers, he added.
   ``I simply cannot endorse such schemes,'' he told the Senate
Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations.
   He argued for a U.S. contribution to increase the capital of the
World Bank, the largest single source of aid loans to Third World
countries. He said pulling out of the World Bank or the
Inter-American Development Bank, as some critics have suggested,
would reduce U.S. influence and make it more likely that they would
act contrary to U.S. interests.
   But he said the Reagan administration would not ask Congress for
money to bring the United States up to date in the year beginning
Sept. 30 on its arrears in payments to the World Bank. He said West
Germany, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia had reduced their contributions
because of the U.S. shortfalls and he was sorry about that.
   He promised that the Reagan administration, before it leaves
office, will ask that the money be furnished in the 12 months
following Oct. 1, 1989.
   Rep. David R. Obey, D-Wis., told Secretary of State George P.
Shultz earlier this month that the arrears should be paid before a
new contribution is sought. Obey, chairman of the House
Appropriations foreign operations subcommittee, predicted there
will be trouble in Congress for the administration's request.
   Baker said the administration will not ask for new contributions
to the Inter-American Development Bank until the borrowing
countries, which now control lending, give the U.S. government
greater power over new loans.
   During Baker's testimony, Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., complained
of the bank's internal spending. He said it:
   _Recently moved into one of the most expensive new buildings in
Washington at a cost of $225 million.
   _Spent an average of more than $100,000 each on separation pay
for departing employees.
   _Had an average of 35 claims a year on its health insurance for
each employee.
   ``We agree that's the kind of thing that has to be cleaned up,''
Baker said, but did not confirm Nickles' figures.
   Baker clashed with Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairman of
the subcommittee, over plans to help other countries refinance as
much as $16 billion owed to the United States for weapons and other
military aid. Inouye said regulations proposed by the Treassury
could add as much as two percentage points to borrower's costs.
   About $5 billion worth of Israel's debts would be affected, and
the high cost of refinancing might discourage other countries from
using the plan, Inouye said.

   U.S. servicemen joined West
German firefighters Wednesday in piling sandbags to protect the
city of Wiesbaden from the floodwaters of the swollen Rhine River.
   Thousands of volunteers have pitched in the past three days to
protect people's lives and property from flooding.
   Six people are believed to have died in flood-related accidents.
   Floodwaters slowly receded in most of West Germany on Wednesday,
but the situation along the Danube River in central Bavaria state
was still critical after the worst flooding in 70 years. About
3,500 Bavarians had fled their homes.
   In Wiesbaden, U.S. Air Force security police and West German
firefighters worked to shore up dikes on the Rhine River with
sandbags.
   ``We had 70 security police working out there all night with
West German firemen,'' U.S. Air Force spokesman Hans Ostertag said.
   No major flooding problems were reported Wednesday in Wiesbaden,
near Frankfurt, as the Rhine receded from dangerous levels.
   Residents of Ahofling, a Bavarian hamlet 12 miles east of
Regensburg, stayed up Tuesday night trying to keep the Danube from
inundating their homes.
   ``Most of the 415 residents of Ahofling were up all night
filling sandbags to bolster a dike,'' said Herbert Zeitler, a state
spokesman.
   ``The waters are receding slowly but there is still danger of
breaks in the dike,'' said Zeitler.
   Zeitler said property damage ``will run in the millions'' of
dollars.
   The Bavarian Interior Ministry warned the situation could again
worsen if warmer weather accompanied by heavy rains speeds up the
spring thaw of snow in mountainous areas.
   ``The ground is saturated and it will take several months before
it will again be able to absorb any large amounts of water,'' the
ministry said in a statement.
   In Bonn, Chancellor Helmut Kohl issued a statement expressing
condolences to the familes of those who died in the floods and
gratitude to people who pitched in to help avert further
catastrophes.

<HEAD>Armenians Vow to Continue Strike Until Government Gives In</HEAD>

   Armenians threatened to continue a general strike
paralyzing the main city of a disputed southern region until the
government agreed to make the region part of Aremenia, newspapers
reported Wednesday.
   For the first time, an official Soviet newspaper, Komsomolskaya
Pravda, used the word ``strike'' to describe what was previously
was referred to as truancy or absenteeism in Stepanakert, the
central city of Azerbaijan's Nagorno-Karabakh region.
   The Soviet press generally uses the word ``strike'' only to
describe labor unrest in the West. But Komsomolskaya Pravda, the
organ of the youth organization Komsomol, took advantage of Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's drive for openness to break from
tradition.
   The daily also provided the first official confirmation that the
strike was part of a series of labor protests in Stepanakert and
that the walkout started March 24, not Saturday as other newspapers
have indicated.
   All but essential services such as bakeries and dairies, some
public transportation and medical clinics were reported to be shut
down in Stepanakert, a city of more than 33,000 people. The
government has lost millions of rubles in revenue because of the
strike, newspapers said.
   ``We're only two or three steps from catastrophe,'' Vasily
Atadzhanyan, the director of a shoe factory, told Komsomolskaya
Pravda. ``We will pay huge fines for not fulfilling our obligations
to our customers. We say directly: `Not coming to work is
sabotage.'''
   Only about 120 of 1,500 workers showed up for work Monday at the
shoe factory, the newspaper said.
   ``People are sitting home ... without noise and without
demonstrations,'' said a man answering the telephone at the
official newspaper in Stepanakert, Sovietsky Karabakh. ``People say
they are going to stay away until they get a decision from the
government in their favor.''
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda said many Stepanakert
residents were upset that Soviet newspapers were not accurately
reporting the dispute.
   ``We want everyone to know the truth. The absences from work
will continue until our matter is settled,'' Pravda quoted one
resident as saying.
   Early press coverage claimed that Armenians, who are mostly
Christian, and Azerbaijanis, who are mostly Shiite Moslem, live
together in harmony. It blamed the unrest, in which at least 32
people have died, on a few ``extremists.''
   Authorities have been meeting with residents to urge them to
return to their jobs and vowed not to bow to pressure to annex
predominantly Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia.
   Instead, authorities have unveiled a plan to spend up to 400
million rubles, or $640 million, to improve social and economic
conditions in the Aremenian-dominated region.
   The labor newspaper Trud said people in Stepanakert were
grateful for the government's efforts but that some still believed
it was necessary to stay away from work to press their demand.
   The newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya said about 100 specialists and
workers appeared for work at an electrical-technical factory
Tuesday morning.
   Ninety percent of the workers at a plant manufacturing
construction materials appeared at work Monday morning, only to
walk out en masse, Komsomolskaya Pravda said.
   Armenians began mass street rallies and strikes in Stepanakert
on Feb. 13. The turmoil spread to the capital of the Armenian
republic, Yerevan. On Feb. 28, ethnic rioting broke out in Sumgait,
a industrial city in Azerbaijan, and officials said 26 Armenians
and six Azerbaijanis were killed.

<TEXT>
   A Hindu ascetic has been standing for
three months in the western state of Gujarat to collect funds for a
shelter for holy cows.
   Ramanuj Vaishnavdas, 24, has been on his feet under a tree in
front of a temple in Palanpur town day and night to collect 5,551
rupees (about $427). He wants to build a shelter for the cows,
which are considered holy and an image of the mother by the Hindus.
   The sadhu, or ascetic, takes a break only for 15 minutes every
morning for his ritual bath, the United News of India news agency
reported Wednesday.
   He sleeps and eats _ only one meal a day _ while standing.
   Cow shelters and orphanages are common in India, where cows roam
freely on the streets and often are a traffic hazard. Cow slaughter
is illegal in many of India's 25 states.

<HEAD>Federal Aid to Church Groups for Chastity Programs Challenged</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal law aimed at encouraging chastity
among teen-agers provides money to religious groups that, in one
instance, advised ``young girls to pretend that Jesus is their
date,'' the Supreme Court was told Wednesday.
   ``We're not saying that chastity cannot be a secular value, but
it has been misused'' by religious groups funded under the 1981
law, argued Janet Benshoof, an American Civil Liberties Union
lawyer.
   As a result, she contended, the law unconstitutionally promotes
religion.
   But the Reagan administration's top-ranked courtroom lawyer
defended the law.
   Solicitor General Charles Fried conceded that ``there may have
been some departures'' from past Supreme Court rulings on
church-state relations by some private organizations carrying out
the law's purpose. But he said such ``constitutionally
troublesome'' spending of federal money has been corrected, and
that the law can be carried out in a constitutionally acceptable
way.
   The law, known as the Adolescent Family Life Act, was passed by
Congress ``in response to grave social, economic and health costs''
of early-adolescent pregnancy, Fried said.
   He noted that religiously affiliated groups for years have
participated in government programs dealing with juvenile
delinquency, foster care, adoption and drug prevention.
   The disputed law, sponsored by former Sen. Jeremiah Denton,
R-Ala., and ushered through Congress by fellow conservatives,
provided millions of dollars for three general program categories _
care, prevention and research.
   ``Care services'' include pregnancy testing, maternity
counseling, adoption and referral help.
   ``Prevention services'' are those aimed at discouraging
adolescent sexual relations, and include programs offering
counseling and family planning.
   The law requires applicants for funding to describe how, in
providing services, they will ``involve religious and charitable
organizations, voluntary associations and other groups in the
private sector.''
   The law also allows religiously affiliated organizations to
receive money for such programs.
   A federal judge here struck down the law last year, ruling that
its primary effect is to promote religion and that it fosters an
excessive entanglement between government and religion.
   The administration then asked the Supreme Court to salvage the
law. The justices are expected to announce their decision by July.
   Benshoof acknowledged that federal money may be used to cope
with the problem of teen-age pregnancies. More than 1 million
unmarried girls become pregnant each year, and about half obtain
abortions.
   But the ACLU lawyer added that the 1981 envisions a
constitutionally suspect ``union between government and religion.''
   ``Not once in seven years has (the Department of Health and
Human Services) questioned the religiousity of any institution
receiving aid'' under the law, Benshoof contended.
   When Justice Antonin Scalia asked whether Congress could spend
money to encourage self-restraint by teen-agers, Benshoof said
groups receiving the money ``can't do it by telling young girls to
pretend that Jesus is their date.''
   The ACLU says a Virginia organization that received $150,000
under the law offered such advice.

   Plans by Salvadoran guerrillas to escalate
their war against the U.S.-backed government reinforce their
``well-deserved reputation for ruthless and indiscriminate
violence,'' the State Department said Wednesday.
   The rebel plan was disclosed by the insurgents' high command at
a news conference with foreign journalists in guerrilla-held
territory. Among other steps, the rebels said they intend to target
U.S. military advisers for assassination.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the United States
obviously ``will not be intimidated by threats against its
personnel. The U.S. commitment to assist the democratic government
of El Salvador, backed by a strong bipartisan consensus, remains
firm.''
   The rebel leaders said they plan to increase attacks in San
Salvador, the capital, targeting the country's upper class, to use
surface-to-air missiles against military helicopers and to step up
attacks against military installations.
   Redman said the proposed rebel offensive ``once again confirms
their disregard for the well-being of the Salvadoran people and
their commitment to achieve power and install a totalitarian
dictatorship at any price.''

   Two Greenpeace volunteers scaled Nelson's Column
on Wednesday to protest acid rain pollution.
   The two men, who made their ascent in five hours using
equipment, were arrested and charged with breaching the peace when
they descended the 170-foot landmark in Trafalgar Square later in
the day, Greenpeace officials said.
   Joe Thompson, 26, and John Stevenson, 30, started their ascent
on the column at 4 a.m. and reached the statue of Admiral Horatio
Nelson, a 19th-century British naval hero, about five hours later.
   During their descent, they unfurled a banner reading ``Stop Acid
Rain'' on the column.
   Thompson and Stevenson, both from Sheffield in northern England,
used climbing ropes and harnesses. The environmental group wanted
to highlight what it considers government complacency over acid
rain damage.
   It urged Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government to
allocate part of the estimated $8.2 billion in electricity price
increases in the next four years to fighting acid raid, caused
mainly by sulfur and nitrogen emissions from coal-fueled power
plants and factories.

<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. has agreed to halt
sales of lawn darts, following a federal complaint about the
potentially dangerous sports items, the Consumer Product Safety
Commission said Wednesday.
   Sears agreed in a consent decree to stop selling lawn darts
within a week, the commission said.
   The decree settles charges that the nationwide retailer offered
lawn darts for sale without required warning labels and in areas
near toy sales.
   Lawn darts are an outdoor game in which large, pointed darts are
tossed at targets on the ground. They can pose a serious hazard,
with three deaths reported in the last 18 years and an estimated
670 annual injuries, the safety agency said.
   Federal regulations require warning labels on the darts and
prohibit their sales in or near toy sales areas. They are permitted
to be sold as sporting goods.
   ``Sears' prompt response to the commission's concerns should
serve as an example for manufacturers and other retailers of lawn
darts,'' said commission Chairman Terrence M. Scanlon.
   The agency asked that consumers report injuries or improper
sales of lawn darts by calling it at 1-800-638-2772.

<HEAD>Farmer Group Urges Incentive To Sell Grain On Open Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat farmers should be provided with some
kind of incentive to sell grain on the open market rather than have
to forfeit it to the government when price support loans come due,
the National Association of Wheat Growers said Wednesday.
   Frank Johannsen, association president, said wheat farmers
deserve the same kind of consideration given corn producers who are
being allowed to keep their grain under federal price support for
an additional year.
   That was a reference to Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng's
announcement Tuesday that price support loans for some old-crop
corn and sorghum will be extended a year longer than their normal
maturity dates.
   Johannsen, a Bayard, Neb., wheat farmers said in a statement
released here that the association is ``seeking a way to encourage
growers to settle their maturing loans'' by paying them off with
generic certificates. The certificates are issued by USDA as
payment-in-kind under crop programs and can be exchanged for
surplus commodities owned by the department's Commondity Credit
Corp.
   If the price support loans are not repaid, a farmer must forfeit
the grain to the CCC, which cancels the debt.
   Once the CCC takes over the grain, it must be moved into
government storage. Much of the CCC wheat is currently being sold
back into the market in weekly auctions.
   ``Since current estimates are that it costs the government at
least 20 cents a bushel to move, store, catalog and exchange
forfeited wheat through weekly auctions, our proposal won't cost
anything extra and it will reduce some of the government's
logistical problems,'' Johannsen said. ``It has the added benefit
of keeping wheat moving in the pipeline of our much-improved
market.''
   Besides, he said, grain farmers ``have a right to expect
even-handed treatment'' from the department. ``Forcing farmers to
forfeit their loans only broadens the government's role in
markets.''

<HEAD>Clampdown Fails To Stop Violence: Four Killed, 39 Shot</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIT SAHUR, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Arabs defied a
massive security crackdown and battled Israeli troops in the West
Bank on Wednesday to mark a Palestinian anniversary. Soldiers
killed four Arabs and wounded 39 others, officials said.
   The army's toughest restrictions in more than 20 years of
occupation failed to contain the violence. The measures included
mass arrests, the deployment of thousands of extra police,
restrictions on media coverage and a ban on Palestinians traveling
in occupied areas.
   ``We can't say that Land Day was quiet. It was not,'' said West
Bank commander Maj. Gen. Avraham Mitzna.
   The day commemorates a confrontation on March 30, 1976, when
Israeli Arabs protested the forced sale of 1,600 acres of their
land for Jewish settlement. Six Arabs were killed.
   Wednesday's fatalities brought the Arab death toll to 123 since
the unrest began Dec. 8, according to U.N. figures. One Israeli
soldier has also been killed.
   The army closed the Arab-owned Palestine Press Service for six
months, further illustrating the seriousness Israel attaches to
reducing media coverage.
   The agency, the only Arab information service, has been a vital
source of breaking news for foreign journalists since Israel
ordered the territories closed Monday.
   The army barred reporters from entering the West Bank and Gaza
Strip except in news pools with an army escort. Army spokeswoman
Ofra Preuss said reporters violating the ban would be prosecuted
with the maximum penalty being five years in prison.
   U.S. television networks and some journalists entered the
territories with military escorts. Others slipped through alone _
taking back roads, accompanying Jewish settlers or posing as
tourists.
   In Arab towns throughout Israel, about 30,000 Israeli Arabs
waved Palestinian flags and chanted anti-occupation slogans as
helicopters circled overhead. About 4,000 extra police were
deployed.
   In street battles in a half-dozen areas around the biblical city
of Bethlehem, troops clashed with Arab protesters who hurled rocks,
bottles, metal bars and raised the outlawed Palestinian flag.
   Officials at Beit Jalla Hospital said 12 Arabs were wounded.
   In the village of Beit Sahur, where tradition says shepherds
spotted the star signaling Jesus' birth, about 200 Arab protesters
clashed with troops who responded with tear gas and live
ammunition, Arab witnesses said.
   Witnesses said one Palestinian was shot and wounded in the
demonstration.
   Mitzna said the high casualty toll was the result of army orders
to crush PLO-ordered protests on Land Day.
   ``The high number of casualities was caused by the active,
immediate and forceful measures of our units everywhere there was
an attempt to violate order,'' Mitzna said.
   Mitzna said four Arabs were killed by army gunfire and 45 to 47
injured, most from shooting and some from tear gas and beatings.
Hospital officials said 39 of the injured were shot.
   In Deir Abu Mashal, a West Bank village 20 miles northwest of
Jerusalem, troops killed a 50-year-old woman and wounded three
other family members. The army and hospital officials gave
conflicting versions of the clash.
   Doctors at Ramallah Hospital said the troops entered the home of
Wajalah Rabir while she and her family were having breakfast and
fatally shot her in the head.
   ``The soldiers came in and asked if there were any men in the
house,'' Mrs. Rabir's 17-year-old daughter, Zeinab, said in quotes
relayed by a visitor at hospital.
   The daughter said she told the troops no men were home, but they
entered anyway. A soldier shot one brother who started to run and
other family members then lunged toward the troops. The soldiers
opened fire, she said.
   Mitzna said the clash began when soldiers entered the village to
search for Arabs who allegedly fired four shots at an army
roadblock.
   ``Inside the village there was violent resistance to arrests and
as a result ... a woman was killed who participated in a brutal
attack on soldiers,'' Mitzna said.
   The commander of the unit said Mrs. Rabir was shot when she used
a rake to strike an unconscious soldier.
   In the village of Burqa, troops opened fire on Arab protesters,
killing Khalid Salah, 22, officials at Al Ittihad Hospital in
nearby Nablus said.
   The other two fatalities were identified as Abdel Kareem
Mohammed Halakha, 25, of the village of Shuyukh near Hebron and
Hosni Omar Shaheen, 24, of Yamoun north of Nablus, Arab reports
said.
   The three-day crackdown in the occupied lands began late Monday
and early Tuesday. The 850,000 Palestinians on the West Bank were
ordered confined to their villages while the 650,000 Arabs on the
Gaza Strip were prohibited from leaving their homes.
   In Washington, the State Department defended Israel's authority
to maintain order in the territories but said it should be
exercised in a humane way.
   Spokesman Charles E. Redman supported assertions by Assistant
Secretary of State Richard Schifter that Israel ``not only has the
right but the obligation'' to restore order in the violence-beset
territories it has held since the 1967 Six-Day War.

   Land Day, an annual day of anti-Israel protest,
marks a bloody clash between Israeli troops and Arab citizens over
land confiscation.
   It also has become a day for Palestinians in the occupied lands
to show their opposition to Israeli rule.
   The day commemorates a confrontation on March 30, 1976, when
Israeli Arabs called a general strike to protest the forced sale of
1,600 acres of their land for Jewish settlement.
   The protest, at first peaceful, turned violent when Arab crowds
attacked army vehicles with rocks, knives, crowbars and firebombs.
Troops fired shots to disperse protesters.
   Six Arabs were killed and 31 wounded. Hundreds more were
arrested.
   Officials blamed the Israeli Communist Party, Rakah, for
inciting the protest. But many saw the occasion as a sign that the
Israeli Arab community, which now numbers 700,000, would never be
an integral part of the country.
   Since 1976, Land Day has been a source of tension and violence.
Angry protests have broken out in Israel and the occupied
territories, although no fatalities occurred until this year.
   Authorities, fearing major disturbances this year, closed the
West Bank and Gaza to journalists. West Bank residents were
confined to their towns and villages for three days while residents
of the Gaza Strip were ordered to stay in their homes.

<TEXT>
   The Republican Party, with front-running
George Bush as its likely presidential nominee now that his chief
rival Bob Dole is out of the race, turned to platform matters and
focused on foreign policy as it opened hearings Wednesday.
   ``At the end of the Carter years, the United States was weaker
and Soviet relations were strained,'' Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, a
former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told a GOP panel at
the start of the first of three 1988 national platform hearings.
   ``At the end of Ronald Reagan's presidency, the United States is
stronger and relations with the Soviets are stronger,'' said Mrs.
Kirkpatrick.
   Wednesday's session on foreign policy matters will be followed
by hearings in Kansas City, Mo., on May 31, and Los Angeles on June
30, in advance of the GOP National Convention in New Orleans Aug.
15-18, where a platform will be produced.
   The May session will focus on education, child care and
neighborhood development matters, while the June hearing will
concentrate on economic growth.
   Vice President Bush is leading the GOP presidential delegate
race. Dole, a senator from Kansas who had been his main challenger
in the early primaries and caucuses, withdrew from the contest on
Tuesday, leaving Pat Robertson still running but far behind Bush.
   Mrs. Kirkpatrick, who provided a foreign policy overview at the
platform hearing, said the most important accomplishment of the
Reagan administration has been to ``demonstrate through domestic
and foreign policy the power of freedom.''
   She said progress has been made during Reagan's tenure in
rebuilding American military forces and bringing terrorists to
justice. She added that progress also has been achieved in
U.S.-Soviet relations.
   Former Reagan administration officials, think-tank
representatives and members of Congress testified before the
Republican Platform Committee Panel on what they saw as the
successes of the Reagan years and on their views of the Carter era
and of the Democratic presidential candidates.
   More than 60 legislators and former officials arranged to
testify on issues including those involving Central America,
international terrorism, U.S.-Soviet relations, defense resources,
veterans, and Reagan's proposed Strategic Defense Initiative, also
known as Star Wars.
   L. Francis Bouchey, a member of the Council for Inter-American
Security, accused leading Democratic candidates Michael Dukakis and
Jesse Jackson of attempting to return to what he called the
``failed years of the Carter administration.''
   Bouchey accused the Democrats of ``neo-isolationism and
on-again, off-again support of the Nicaraguan resistance fighters.''
   Rep. Bill Green, R-N.Y., urged the party to ``be in step with
the majority of Americans, including American women.''
   ``Women may well determine who is the next president. They
probably will decide some Senate and congressional races this
November,'' Green said in a statement released before his testimony.
   ``It would not be smart for a political party to ignore or anger
such voters. Yet there is a danger of the Republican Party's doing
just that,'' he said.
   The panel included GOP National Committee Chairman Frank J.
Fahrenkopf Jr.; Maureen Reagan, co-chairman of the Republican
National Committee; Sen. Robert W. Kasten Jr., R-Wis.; Rep. Jerry
Lewis, R-Calif.; Chuck Hardwick, speaker of the New Jersey State
Assembly; and Delaware Gov. Michael N. Castle.

   An adviser to Jesse Jackson said Wednesday he
detected the beginnings of an anonymous ``Stop Jackson'' movement
in the Democratic Party, and a Southern party chairman acknowledged
there is ``an awful lot of apprehension out there'' about the
possibility of Jackson's nomination.
   Democratic establishment leaders gathered here with Jackson, and
after that meeting, Jackson supporter Rep. Mickey Leland of Texas
said he understood an effort to stop Jackson was afoot.
   Leland said he did not know who was behind the attempt, and said
he knew of no party leaders joining such a movement. But he said it
did not appear to be confined to Southern white Democrats.
   ``There is some movement afoot,'' Leland said. ``We can't put
our hands on it. We don't know who the leader is. But we do
understand ... different players of the Democratic Party have been
approached.''
   He named Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk and House
Speaker Jim Wright as among those approached. Contacted later, Kirk
and a spokesman for Wright said no one had talked to them about
keeping the nomination away from Jackson.
   ``I haven't talked to anyone, and no one's approached me,'' said
Kirk, who earlier this week rejected talk of a movement to block
Jackson.
   Although Jackson fell substantially behind Michael Dukakis in
Connecticut's primary Tuesday, his 2-to-1 victory in Michigan on
Saturday has forced Democratic leaders to confront the possibility
that Jackson could end the primary season as top vote getter and
perhaps delegate leader.
   In recognition of that, a group representing the top ranks of
Washington's old-line Democratic establishment _ including
presidential adviser Clark Clifford, former party chairman John
White and one-time Mondale aide Richard Moe _ met with Jackson over
breakfast at a downtown hotel.
   They came away praising Jackson and insisting they wouldn't be
party to any effort to block him.
   ``I don't think there will be at this particular time,
especially from the South, a stop Jesse Jackson movement,'' said
Charles Whitehead, state Democratic Party chairman from Florida,
after the session.
   Whitehead acknowledged widespread concern among Democrats about
the prospect of Jackson winning the nomination, however. In the
wake of Michigan, some Democrats have privately voiced the fear
that the liberal black Jackson could prove an unelectable nominee
in the fall and damage other Democratic candidates.
   ``I would be less than honest with you if I didn't tell you
there is absolutely an awful lot of apprehension out there among an
awful lot of Democrats about the nomination of Jesse Jackson,''
Whitehead said. ``Sure there is.
   ``They're afraid of nominating someone that they consider
unelectable,'' he said.
   But Whitehead, whose state primary was won by Dukakis, the
Massachusetts governor, said there was ``that same apprehension
about nominating an Eastern liberal.''
   ``You've got a fear there if you nominate an Eastern liberal,
you've nominated another (Walter) Mondale,'' who lost 49 states as
the 1984 nominee, he said.
   Most Democratic Party insiders have said this week that any
public effort to block Jackson would be damaging and alienate
blacks and other voters the party will need in the fall, no matter
who the nominee is. ``You can't win with him and can't win without
him,'' one political source said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Another source close to Democratic Party politics said concerns
among party leaders had eased with the Connecticut vote following
``two days of gnashing of teeth.''
   He said a feeling was growing that Jackson was strengthening the
party with new voters, and that they should not be discouraged by
suggestions Jackson would be denied the nomination. But, he
contended, the remaining calender of big-state primaries decreases
the likelihood Jackson would end up with the most delegates.
   Fueling talk of a stop-Jackson effort was a campaign begun this
week by Alabama Democratic Chairman John Baker. He suggested in a
letter to party leaders around the South that they form a group of
unpledged convention delegates who will commit themselves to ``the
most electable'' presidential candidate.
   Baker denied his effort was aimed at Jackson, but he came under
fire in his own state. A black state senator, Michael Figures of
Mobile, a Jackson supporter, accused Baker of racist remarks.
   ``It's not my intention to sound racist,'' Baker said. ``But I
need to be candid, and I need to talk practical politics. We've got
to think who can beat George Bush and the rest of the Republicans.''

   Israel's surrogate militia raided a south
Lebanon town in tanks Wednesday with support from helicopter
gunships, killing seven people, wounding 15 and knocking down
scores of houses, police reported.
   The assault on the Shiite Moslem town of Kfar Roumman at 9:45
a.m. coincided with a general strike and joint Lebanese-Palestinian
demonstration in Lebanon's Moslem sectors in solidarity with the
4-month-old Arab rebellion in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   Police and U.N. observers said militiamen of the South Lebanon
Army in 12 Soviet-designed T-54 tanks advanced to Kfar Roumman,
half a mile west of the ``security zone'' Israel maintains in south
Lebanon, and fought guerrillas of the Hezbollah, or Party of God.
The tanks were supplied by Israel, which captured them from Arab
armies.
   Police said SLA militiamen killed five civilians and two
Hezbollah fighters in a house-to-house search of Kfar Roumman, a
town of 2,000 people, and pulled back to the security zone four
hours later.
   Israeli helicopter gunships strafed Kfar Roumman with machine
guns, police reported.
   They said the militiamen advanced behind a barrage of 155mm
howitzer fire from Israeli positions in the zone.
   According to the police report, Kfar Roumman was hit with more
than 140 rounds from tank cannon and mortars before the assault and
13 people were wounded. They said two other people were wounded by
shells that fell on Nabatiyeh, a market town nearby.
   A police spokesman said the militia apparently was pursuing
Hezbollah fighters who attacked two of its outposts before dawn.
   ``Islamic resistance (Hezbollah) fighters were seen withdrawing
from Kfar Roumman. The village has been devastated by shelling,''
said the spokesman, whose name was withheld in keeping with
regulations.
   U.N. peacekeeping observers in the south said Israeli troops and
SLA militiamen had expected attacks on Land Day, which marks a
clash on March 30, 1976, between Israeli troops and Arab citizens
over land confiscation in the occupied territories.
   Banks, schools, shops, restaurants and other businesses were
closed in Beirut, the northern port of Tripoli, the Bekaa Valley of
east Lebanon and the southern ports of Sidon and Tyre. The strike
was called by the National Committee in Support of the Palestinian
Uprising.
   Several demonstrations were held in Jordan, most of whose
citizens are Palestinian. More than 500 students chanting
``Revolution Until Victory!'' rallied at the Jordan University
campus in Amman.
   About 10,000 Palestinian and Lebanese leftists marched in Moslem
west Beirut, escorted by police and carrying banners. Similar
demonstrations were reported in Sidon and Tyre.
   Banners reading ``The Youngsters of Lebanon Praise the Uprising
in Palestine'' and ``Down with Shultz's (peace) Plan'' were among
those raised in Beirut.
   Leaders of Palestinian groups, some of them at odds, and
representatives of several leftist militia factions united in the
throng that marched across Beirut's main Corniche Mazraa
thoroughfare.
   It was the strongest Lebanese expression of solidarity with the
Palestinians since the invading Israeli army drove the Palestine
Liberation Organization out of the country in 1982.

<HEAD>Bush Moves Away From Meese Controversy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush, moving quickly
to put distance between himself and the controversy surrounding
Attorney General Edwin Meese III, said Wednesday the Justice
Department ``has to be above reproach.''
   Bush said he was troubled by the resignation of top Justice
Department officials, but ``I'm not going to pass judgment'' on
whether Meese should resign.
   The Republican presidential candidate, in a statement devoid of
any support for the embattled attorney general, said Meese must
make up his own mind on quitting.
   Bush said Meese would not hold the top law enforcement post in a
Bush administration.
   Campaigning for the first day without a major GOP rival, Bush
was peppered by reporters with questions on the Meese controversy.
   Two top Justice Department officials quit on Tuesday amid
reports of Meese's mounting legal difficulties.
   Clearly eager to keep the matter from becoming a campaign issue,
Bush told reporters, ``Morale in (the) Justice (Department) is very
important.''
   ``It seems to me that the Justice Department has to be above
reproach.propriety,'' he said.
   Speaking for himself, Bush said, ``I want to hold an ethical
standard so high that there's no perception of wrongdoing.''
   Asked whether Meese would be attorney general in a Bush
administration, the vice president said, ``No, nor would any other
member of the (Reagan) Cabinet, because I want to have a new
Cabinet.''
   When a reporter suggested that Bush's position on whether Meese
should resign remained unclear, Bush responded: ``That's what I
intend.''
   He also said he didn't think the affair would rub off on his
campaign, but suggested, ``I'm sure my opponents will try to use
it.''
   ``I'm not going to prejudge Mr. Meese. I'd like to find out a
little more about what is happening here,'' Bush said.
   Meanwhile, Bush told a lunchtime rally that it didn't matter to
him which candidate the Democrats finally nominate.
   ``I will take on whoever the Democrats put up,'' he said.
   As to whether Republicans would prefer running against Democrat
Jesse Jackson rather than Michael Dukakis, Bush said, ``I don't
plan to get in there and fine-tune what's happening on the
Democratic side.''
   Bush wrapped up three days of campaigning in Wisconsin. During
his visit, he picked up the endorsement of former rivals Rep. Jack
Kemp and Sen. Bob Dole quit the race, giving him a virtual lock on
the GOP nomination.
   Bush aides said the vice president would skip a visit back to
Wisconsin that had been tentatively planned for Monday so he can
focus his attention on consolidating his support and planning
future campaign appearances.
   Spokesman Pete Teeley said Dole, who withdrew from the GOP race
on Tuesday, was expected to make campaign appearances on Bush's
behalf _ but specifics had not been worked out.

<HEAD>Fighter Jet Crashes, Narrowly Misses Nuclear Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANDSHUT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A French jet fighter crashed and
exploded Wednesday near a nuclear power plant, but officials said
the facility could have withstood the force of the impact if the
plane had hit it.
   The pilot of the Mirage jet fighter was killed when his plane
went down at 9:20 a.m. about a mile from the Isar plant at the
Bavarian village of Ohu.
   Federal and state officials said the concrete domes covering
West German nuclear plants are strong enough to withstand a direct
hit from a plummeting airliner, so there was no risk of a nuclear
accident.
   ``There was no danger at the power plant,'' said Edith Volz, a
spokeswoman for the state-run Bavarian Utilities in Munich. ``The
complex is protected by heavy concrete walls and the reactors are
safe from plane crashes.''
   The Mirage burst into flames and exploded on impact, spreading
debris over a wide area, police said.
   The fighter took off from the Strasbourg-Entzheim Air Base
outside of Strasbourg, France, and was on a ``totally routine,
low-altitude mission,'' according to a French air force spokesman,
who spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with Defense
Ministry regulations.
   The French Defense Ministry identified the pilot as Lt. Thierry
Millet, 26, and said he was not flying unusually low or close to a
nuclear facility.
   France has military forces based in West Germany, and its
military aircraft frequently fly training missions over West German
territory.
   Anti-nuclear activists used the incident to renew criticism of
atomic power plants and of low-level military flights that are
common over Bavaria.
   Opposition Social Democrats in Bavaria said they would bring the
matter up for debate in the state's parliament.
   ``This is proof that the authorities have underestimated the
dangers posed'' by military training flights, said Dietmar Franzke,
a Social Democratic state delegate.
   The plant at Ohu is an 870-megawatt Isar I reactor, which began
producing electricity in 1977. Isar II, a 1,300-megawatt reactor
that is also located in the area, is not yet on line, officials
said.
   Military aircraft are barred from flying over nuclear power
plants, according to Alfons Metzger, a spokesman for the Bavarian
Interior Ministry.
   In Bonn, defense ministry officials said there were no signs
indicating the French pilot had failed to adhere to those
regulations.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exiled stage director Yuri Lyubimov expressed his
desire to return to the Soviet Union in an unusual newspaper
interview that could signal official willingness to allow him to
come back.
   Lyubimov was interviewed by the government newspaper Izvestia in
Madrid, where he viewed four perfomances by Moscow's Taganka
Theater of Maxim Gorky's ``Mother.''
   Lyubimov, 70, founded the Taganka Theater and over 20 years
turned it into Moscow's most popular modern theater with his
avant-garde productions.
   The director struggled constantly with censors. In July 1983 he
was allowed to travel to London to stage Fyodor Dostoyevsky's
``Crime and Punishment'' amid speculation authorities did not want
him to return.
   In March 1984 he was thrown out of the Communist Party, and four
months later his Soviet citizenship was revoked.
   Lyubimov has staged productions around the world since then. He
took Israeli citizenship this year and has moved to Jerusalem with
his wife, Katalin, and son, Peter. He is almost never mentioned in
the official press.
   In its article on Tuesday, Izvestia stressed that Soviet writers
and artists have more freedom under Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms,
in a possible effort to show the differences between Lyubimov and
authorities have narrowed enough to allow him to return.
   Lyubimov reiterated his previous statement that he would like to
return to work in the Soviet Union if he were guaranteed artistic
freedom, but that he was making no political demands.
   ``We are talking only about the creative side of my life,'' he
was quoted as saying.
   After more than four years abroad, ``in order to once again gain
strength, survive, one needs to stand on his native land, on which
he was raised, where his fathers and grandfathers lived,'' Lyubimov
said.
   Even while he has been exiled, he told the newspaper, he has
concentrated on staging productions that acquaint the world with
Russian culture.
   He praised the more open literature that is being published
under Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, and said, ``it is necessary
to come, to see, and to work in the theater.''
   On year ago, Lyubimov and a group of other exiled scientists and
artists wrote an open letter expressing their doubts about
Gorbachev's reforms, calling the Soviet Union a ``gravely sick
country.''
   The letter was printed by the weekly Moscow News, and the
writers were criticized bitterly in the official media, which
accused them of wishing evil on their native land.
   Izvestia reported that Taganka's current director, Nikolai
Gubenko, who also was present at the interview, said the theater
wants Lyubimov to return and see what it is doing. ``After that, he
himself can decide his fate,' Gubenko was quoted as saying.
   Lyubimov was quoted as saying his meetings in Madrid with
Taganka actors he once directed were ``good and difficult at the
same time.''

   Sen. Bob Dole said Wednesday that his failed
presidential campaign had made serious tactical mistakes but added
that they weren't the main reason for his downfall.
   In an interview a day after he quit the presidential race, the
Kansas Republican expressed some of his frustrations over his
unsuccessful battle with Vice President George Bush for the GOP
nomination.
   ``The bottom line is that you can't beat Ronald Reagan,'' Dole
said. ``I was running against Ronald Reagan Jr. in the South.''
   That was a reference to Bush's success in campaigning as
Reagan's vice president and logical heir. ``It's just this
promotion idea that you just ought to go up the ladder,'' Dole said.
   He also said Republican Party ``winner-take-all'' rules in the
primaries and caucuses contributed to his exit from the campaign.
   If delegates were divided proportionally, he said, ``I'd still
be in the race.''
   Asked the one thing he would do differently in his campaign,
Dole replied: ``Keep the press off the plane.''
   He complained that reporters on the campaign plane ``sit back
there and they scheme up these little things and the next thing
they're in Time or Newsweek.''
   Dole said he thought he had received some unfair news coverage
during the campaign. For example, he singled out the numerous
stories written about one of his Kansas associates, Dave Owen, who
resigned as national finance chairman of the Dole campaign in
January after reports raised questions involving his financial
dealings.
   But apart from all that, Dole said that his campaign
organization had blundered, particularly in New Hampshire and South
Carolina, and that those mistakes weakened his candidacy early in
the nominating process.
   For example, he did not respond to last-minute New Hampshire
television ads by Bush raising questions whether Dole cowld
increase taxes. In addition, his campaign spent heavily early in
the nominating process, which caused problems in later contests.
   ``South Carolina we probably should have bypassed instead of
getting in there,'' said Dole.
   Bush's win in South Carolina, he maintained, delivered a boost
to the vice president and helped him sweep the Super Tuesday
primaries that followed in the South, including North Carolina,
Missouri and Oklahoma _ states the Dole campaign had hoped to win.
   ``Now had we won New Hampshire, we still would have had a tough
race,'' Dole said.
   Illinois was the next battleground after Super Tuesday, and Dole
said, ``I knew that we weren't going to win Illinois and I knew
then it was probably over.''
   He said many of his friends and advisers urged him to remain in
the presidential race even when it appeared he had almost no chance
to win the nomination.
   ``You can't do it unless you've got the money,'' said Dole.
   The campaign, he said, would end with a ``little debt'' but he
said he didn't know the exact amount.
   Overall, Dole said, he was pleased with the fund-raising ability
of his campaign and said he had ``good organizations in a number of
states.''
   But he expressed reservations about the management of the
campaign, saying, ``I think as far as organization, I'm not certain
whether we had enough direction.''
   Dole did not criticize William Brock, his campaign chairman who
directed the operation, but said the national political director,
Norman Watts, ``I don't believe was strong enough.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   James and Suzy are having a tiff. And to the
delight of gossip-loving New Yorkers, they're having it out in
public _ in the columns they write for New York Newsday and the New
York Post.
   It began last week, when James _ that's James Revson, Newsday's
new society columnist _ wrote that he felt ``cheated and used'' by
Suzy, who wrote in the Post about a party she did not attend.
   What specifically bothered Revson (one of THE Revsons, of Revlon
cosmetics fame) was that Suzy mentioned 32 people who supposedly
were at the party, but only 12 of whom actually showed up.
   Suzy was on vacation (``on the sunswept isle of Mustique'') when
both her column and Revson's appeared. But by Wednesday she was
back. And Suzy _ that's just plain Suzy to you, Aileen Mehle to her
friends _ was furious.
   In a column that combined the tact of Joan Rivers with the
politesse of Sean Penn, Suzy called Revson ``a liar,'' ``a rat,'' a
``know-nothing,'' ``a nut,'' ``a jerk'' and ``a snake.'' Among
other things.
   To be sure, Suzy admitted she had written about the party,
thrown by Metropolitan Museum Chairman (and New York Times
Publisher) Arthur ``Punch'' Sulzberger, in advance. She said it was
the only way she could get out of town for her vacation (which was
``heaven.'').
   And yes, she said, it's true that some of the people she said
were at the party never did show up.
   And yes, ``I should have yanked the whole thing or at least the
names the (press) release said would attend.''
   But is she apologizing? Not a chance.
   ``I bow in accuracy and meticulousness and decency to no one,''
she wrote. ``That is the reason I have survived as a star all these
long years _ that and because in my field I am the best and the
brightest there is.''
   ``And dear readers, fans and publicity-seekers, I would like to
go on record as telling the world that any place Rat Revson is, I
will not be. Do not invite me anywhere if you invite him. Just call
it a boycott _ or even a Suzycott.''
   The target of the Suzycott says he is unimpressed. ``I'm not
joining it,'' he said. ``I refuse to join it even if she asks me.''
   Revson said he thought Suzy's column ``showed a certain lack of
restraint on her part. ... I didn't know that a lady knew those
words, or how to spell them.''
   ``On a serious note,'' he added, ``columnists are journalists,
columnists are reporters, and there are ethics. And nobody is
allowed to break those.''
   Is he worried about the effect of the Suzy controversy on his
fledgling column?
   ``I'm delighted,'' said Revson, obviously holding to the theory
that any publicity is good publicity. ``The next time I see her, I
may buy her a drink.''

<HEAD>Three Cubans Die In Consulate Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A city fire investigator Wednesday said that
three Cubans who died battling a blaze at their consulate might
have been saved if firefighters hadn't been kept outside the
building for 15 minutes.
   Investigator Jacques Plouffe criticized the Cuban Consulate for
not informing the fire department of Tuesday's fire.
   ``We might have saved three lives,'' he said.
   Havana radio, monitored in Miami, identified the dead as Pablo
Gonzalez Martinez, 35, an official at the Trade Office; Norma
Goderich, 33, wife of a vice-consul; and Jose Perez Salbaluco, 35,
a consulate guard.
   They died fighting the blaze which apparently started on top
floor of the four-story mansion.
   The blaze took 100 firefighters more than three hours to bring
under control. Its cause was under investigation.
   Authorities first learned of the blaze when security guards at a
nearby luxury apartment building reported smoke coming from the
consulate roof.
   Firefighters then rushed to the consulate but were held back for
about 15 minutes before they were allowed to enter the building,
located on the slopes of Mount Royal.
   By the time they got in, the fire was out of control.
   ``We had a little trouble getting in because there was nobody to
answer the door,'' said the district fire chief, Guy Lafortune, who
arrived about 7:30 p.m. ``They weren't expecting us because nobody
(at the consulate) had called an alarm and everybody in the
building was upstairs fighting the fire.''
   Under the 1963 Vienna convention, authorities of the host
country, such as police and firefighters, cannot enter consular
premises without permission.
   Consul-General Lourdes Urrutia only let the firefighters in
after she received permission from Cuban officials in Ottawa.
   Lafortune said the firefighters were allowed to fight the blaze
on condition that they did not enter certain areas of the building.
   ``Men were stationed at certain doors to keep us away. There was
no fire in those areas,'' said Lafortune.
   Lafortune said his men had a hard time fighting the flames
because every window on the fourth floor was either barred or
heavily shuttered and nailed closed.
   He said he saw about a dozen guns of various kinds on the walls
inside.
   Firefighters said it was easier to get into the Cuban consulate
than into the nearby Soviet consulate when it caught fire in
January 1987. Soviet officials tried to put out that fire with
buckets of snow and a garden hose before firefighters were let in.
   In 1972, when the Cuban trade commission in the north end was
firebombed and one Cuban was killed, Cubans held firefighters and
police off with submachine guns.
   And in 1954, the Soviet Embassy in Ottawa burned to the ground
after officials refused to allow firefighters to fight the fire.
   Investigator Plouffe said it took him and his partner Armand
Villette about 25 minutes to gain entry to the building Wednesday
to retrieve some tools.

<HEAD>Chester County Health Officials Say Rabies Outbreak Worsening</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rabies outbreak in nearby Chester County
has prompted health officials to warn residents to avoid wild
animals and take extra measures to protect pets and farm animals.
   ``The problem is big, and it is growing,'' Harold Russell, chief
veterinarian for the county Health Department said Tuesday. ``What
we are seeing is the tip of a very massive iceberg.'' Eastern parts
of Chester County are some 20 miles west of Philadelphia.
   He warned the rabies virus, which last week forced officials to
kill a horse, is likely to spread into Philadelphia, especially
among raccoons in the city's sprawling Fairmount Park.
   A total of 23 rabies cases have been confirmed in Chester County
this year, compared to 36 in all of 1987, said Ruthie Ketterer,
secretary for the state Health Department's Acute Infectious
Disease division.
   Lancaster County, the next county west of Chester, has reported
37 cases. The total for the state for 1988 is 101, Ketterer said.
   Dr. Robert Sharrar, director of Philadelphia's Office of Health
Promotion and Disease Control, said Wednesday the city was
monitoring the rabies situation in Chester County and surrounding
counties and states.
   The last known case of human rabies in Philadelphia was in 1938,
and the last case in a dog was 1948, he said. Health officials
declared the city rabies free in 1975, but would revoke that
designation at the first rabies case and recommend rabies treatment
for anyone bitten by dogs or cats thereafter, he said.
   Rabies is a viral disease that attacks the brain and is almost
always fatal. A vaccine for humans and dogs was developed by Louis
Pasteur in the 1880s and scientists are working to develop an oral
vaccine which would work when eaten by wild animals.

   Government agents confiscated nearly
685 pounds of cocaine aboard an Ecuadorean boat traveling through
the Panama Canal, a pro-government newspaper reported Wednesday.
   The report in Critica said agents of the National Department of
Investigations detained the ship Isla Baltra after receiving
information from Ecuadorean police about the cargo.
   The boat was headed for Barcelona, Spain.
   Critica said the ship was stopped as it completed its transit of
the canal, boarded by navy squads and special anti-narcotics
agents, then taken to the port of Balboa where it was searched.
   The illegal drug was found in 278 packages in a container of
prefabricrated building material aboard the ship, the report said.
It did not say if any arrests were made or give the estimated value
of the drug.
   The United States has called for the ouster of Panama's
strongman, Gen. Manuel Noriega, since he was indicted on
drug-trafficking charges in February in Florida. He says he is
innocent.

   Prices farmers got for raw products this month
averaged the same as they did in February but still were 7.4
percent above March 1987, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   The department's Agricultural Statistics Board reported higher
prices for lettuce, cattle, eggs and broiler chickens, while
farmers received lower prices for hogs, milk, wheat and sweet corn.
   ``The price of lettuce increased sharply from February to March
but was well below record levels during the November through
January 1988 period,'' the report said. ``Calf prices dropped
slightly from February to March but were at the second highest
level since June of 1979.''
   Prices of cattle sold for beef were the highest since May 1979,
the report said. Hog and wheat prices decline from February, while
corn prices rose slightly.
   Department economists say net cash income of farmers may be in
the range of $50 billion to $55 billion this year, down from the
record level of $57 billion in 1987. That is the difference between
cash receipts and cash expenses during the calendar year.
   Consumer food prices are expected to rise 2 percent to 4 percent
this year, compared with a 4.2 percent average increase in 1987.
   According to the preliminary March figures, based mostly on
mid-month averages, the index for crop prices was up 0.9 percent
from February and averaged 10 percent more than a year ago.
   Commercial vegetable prices rose 11 percent from last month but
were down 7.1 percent from March 1987.
   ``Higher prices for lettuce and tomatoes were major contributors
to the increase in the (vegetable) index,'' the report said. ``The
increase was moderated by lower prices for sweet corn, asparagus,
celery and onions.''
   Lettuce prices were reported at $21.30 per 100 pounds, compared
with $11.10 in February and $35.60 in January.
   The index for livestock and livestock products was down 0.7
percent from February but was 4.2 percent above March 1987. Prices
were higher for cattle, eggs and broilers but were lower for hogs
and milk.
   March farm commodity prices averaged 130 percent of a 1977 base
used for comparison, according to the preliminary figures, the same
as in February. A year ago the March index was 121 percent.
   No new figures for farm production costs were included in the
report. Those have been confined to quarterly averages because of
budget cutbacks.
   In January, however, farm expenses were unchanged from last fall
but averaged 4.4 percent above a year earlier. The next quarterly
figures will be reported in April.
   The report said:
   _Cattle averaged $68.40 per 100 pounds of live weight
nationally, up from $67.40 in February and the $59.30 reported for
March 1987. Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef.
   _Hogs averaged $41.90 per 100 pounds, compared with $45.80 in
March and $47.40 a year earlier.
   _Corn, at $1.84 a bushel, was up from $1.83 in February and the
average of $1.47 per bushel a year earlier.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $2.64 per bushel, compared with $2.79 in February and
$2.57 a year earlier.
   _Rice averaged $8.46 per 100 pounds, compared with $8.97 in
February and $3.62 a year earlier.
   _Soybeans were $5.93 per bushel, compared with $5.97 in February
and $4.73 a year earlier.
   _Upland cotton was reported at 56.9 cents per pound, compared
with 56.8 in February and 47.5 cents in March 1987.
   _Eggs were 50.8 cents per dozen, compared with 46.9 cents in
February and 54.4 cents a year earlier.
   _Milk was $12 per 100 pounds, compared with $12.30 in February
and $12.50 a year earlier.
   _Broilers were 27.5 cents per pound, live weight, compared with
25.7 cents in February and 29.1 cents a year ago.

   Seven hundred of the U.S. troops
sent to Honduras on March 17-18 left Palmerola air base for the
United States and a U.S. spokesman said the rest will be home by
Thursday.
   ``The guys that turn out the lights will be leaving tomorrow
(Thursday),'' said Maj. Gary Hovatter, U.S. military public affairs
officer at Palmerola.
   Hovatter said planes left at a rate of about one an hour
Wednesday carrying the 700 soldiers and equipment back to Fort Ord,
Calif.
   President Reagan sent 3,200 American soldiers to Honduras after
President Jose Azcona Hoyo asked for help. Azcona said that
Sandinista troops from neighboring Nicaragua had invaded Honduras
in pursuit of Contra rebels.
   The Sandinistas reportedly retreated after the Honduran air
force twice bombed the border region, but the U.S. troops stayed on
to finish emergency training exercises with Honduran troops at five
bases throughout Honduras.
   The soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg,
N.C., and the 7th Light Infantry Division at Fort Ord began to
return home Monday.
   Hovatter said the last of the soldiers, about 80 from the 82nd
Airborne, would leave Thursday after ``policing up the place.''
   The United States maintains a permanent operation of about 1,100
to 1,500 soldiers in its Joint Task Force Bravo operation at
Palmerola, the largest and most important U.S. military
headquarters in Central America north of Panama.
   The base is about 40 miles northwest of Tegucigalpa, the
Honduran capital.
   Hovatter said by telephone Wednesday that ``some of the planes
are carrying more equipment than people.''
   The Americans brought about 2.3 million pounds of equipment with
them, including two tanks, 12 105mm howitzers, machine guns,
ammunition and helicopters.
   ``It's gone very smoothly,'' Hovatter said of the redeployment.
``We've had minimal delays and no incidents or accidents.''

<HEAD>Simon, Stressing His Experience, Enters Jackson Territory</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sen. Paul Simon, entering territory staked
out by fellow Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson,
stood in front of a Chrysler Corp. plant Wednesday and declared he
is more qualified to take workers' concerns to the White House.
   When asked whether he has hesitated criticizing Jackson for fear
of offending black voters, Simon said: ``You have to be careful.
You don't want to be perceived as anti-black.'' But he added, ``I
don't have problems running against anyone.''
   ``I'm not here knocking others,'' Simon said, ``but I think
experience is one of the things you should look at.''
   Jackson had led an emotional rally earlier this year at the auto
plant, where 5,500 workers are scheduled to be laid off by the end
of September. Jackson's support for the workers and his call to end
``economic violence'' won him the endorsement of the United Auto
Workers union Local 72.
   Simon, at a news conference next to the plant, said he has a
similar message plus the congressional experience to translate it
into action.
   ``I have been fighting for (workers') policies on the Washington
scene, not just with speeches,'' Simon said. ``I offer not only
passion, but programs.''
   Simon, who won the March 15 Illinois primary, is campaigning for
support in Wisconsin's primary April 5. ``I'm going to do well in
Wisconsin,'' he said, ``and we're going on to Atlanta,'' site of
the Democratic National Convention July 18-21.
   About 20 Simon supporters were on hand for the news conference,
along with some auto workers.
   ``I think he is speaking for the workers as well as Jackson,''
said Bill Seep, an employee of the plant.
   Another employee, Phil Haney, said he expected the workers to
stay unified behind Jackson, though he added some might choose
Simon when they cast their ballots. ``You can't fault anyone who
votes for Simon,'' he said.
   Simon said he would try to rebuild the country's manufacturing
base by removing tax breaks for companies that move jobs overseas
and by giving corporations incentives to boost production in the
United States.
   He added that he came to Kenosha ``because of this plant and
what it represents. What we have had is an administration that has
elevated and sanctified greed.''
   He accused Chrysler of deciding to halt production without
giving enough consideration to the impact on the workers and the
community.

   Some Unification Church members are upset
because their church founder, the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, believes one
of his followers from Zimbabwe is the reincarnation of his son,
according to a report published Wednesday.
   The affair began last fall at the Unification Theological
Seminary in upstate New York, where a senior named Charles was
believed to be hearing and relaying messages from Moon's deceased
son, ``Lord'' Heung Jin Nim, The Washington Post said, quoting
former and present church members.
   Heung Jin Nim was killed in an automobile accident in 1984 at
age 17.
   According to the Post account:
   Dick Richard, a former seminary student who recently left the
church, said that in ``mid-November, I was told there was a black
brother from Africa who had been prepared by Jesus ... and that
Heung Jin Nim had assumed his body.''
   ``It obviously scared a lot of people there .. but they went
along with the whole thing because it came from Reverend Moon, the
Messiah.''
   The reincarnation incident has caused what some followers of
Moon are calling the biggest theological upheaval in the 34-year
history of the Unification Church, in part because the Zimbabwean
reportedly has been slapping church members and elders.
   Officials at The Washington Times, which is owned by church
members, have tried to distance themselves from the affair.
   ``From the bottom of my navel, I don't want to know about
this,'' said Ron Godwin, the Times' senior vice president for
business. ``I know that such a person exists and that he's been
preaching in the church, but I will walk a mile not to get
involved.''
   Arnaud de Borchgrave, chief editor of the Times, at first
dismissed the young Zimbabwean as a plant from communist North
Korea.
   ``The North Koreans have had a very strong presence in Zimbabwe
since day one,'' De Borchgrave said in an interview from Paris.
   ``It just sounds so ridiculous,'' de Borchgrave said. ``The
nameless Zimbabwean _ that strikes me as suspicious right there.
... I've asked people, `Who the hell is this Zimbabwean?' And
nobody can tell you.''
   John Rees, co-owner with de Borchgrave of a private intelligence
newsletter, ``Early Warning,'' said de Borchgrave's ``attitude was
primarily one of concern that it would make the paper look
ludicrous.''
   The Zimbabwean, who has taken the name of Heung Jin Nim, has
been traveling to church parishes around the world, preaching.
   ``This guy talks non-stop,'' said John Raineri, a photographer
for The World and I, sister publication to the Times. ``I've seen
him speak for three days straight he doesn't rest the whole time.''
   One of the most disturbing aspects of the affair, church members
say, is violence attributed to the Zimbabwean.
   The president of the Times, Bo Hi Pak, was admitted to
Georgetown Univeristy Hospital for tests last Dec. 9-17, saying he
had recently fallen down a flight of stairs. No injuries were
found, but later Pak underwent surgery in South Korea to repair a
damaged blood vessel in his skull, according to Times executives.
   Pak is Moon's closest deputy, and stories that he had been
injured spread quickly through the church. Kate Tsubata, a church
member, was skeptical until she heard a church elder describe a
meeting in which Moon was asked about the reincarnated son's
reported violence.
   The elder said that ``even Colonel Pak had been beaten,''
Tsubata said. ``He just let it drop. ... It was quite significant.''
   Tsubata spoke of a friend who was slapped repeatedly by the
Zimbabwean. ``He described them as stinging slaps to the face,
causing him to see stars,'' she said. ``But afterwards, he felt
good.''
   Gordon Anderson, secretary-general of the Moon-financed
Professors World Peace Academy, reported similar behavior during a
church ceremony in the World Missions Center in Manhattan. The
Zimbabwean walked among the 100 church members present, listening
to their confessions and instructing them to repent, usually
through prayers or fasting.
   ``He did slap, but he didn't strike hard enough to hurt anyone.
He cuffed me on the ear a little bit,'' Anderson said.

   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee
recommended overwhelmingly Wednesday that the Senate ratify a
historic treaty to eliminate all U.S. and Soviet medium-range
nuclear weapons.
   ``This is a small step away from the nuclear brink,'' said Sen.
Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said following the committee's 17-2 vote.
   ``It means the elevator of nuclear escalation will finally stop
and hopefully descend,'' said committee chairman Claiborne Pell,
D-R.I.
   Cranston said his head count shows no more than five senators
will vote against the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty when
the full Senate takes up the treaty, probably late next month.
Ratification requires a two-thirds Senate majority, 67 votes if all
100 senators are present and voting.
   The only dissenting votes inside the committee were cast by
Sens. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Larry Pressler, R-S.D. Helms has
worked vigorously to derail the treaty.
   The resounding committee vote papered over a bitter partisan
dispute over an amendment added to the treaty on Tuesday with the
aim of assuring that the meaning of the pact cannot be
reinterpreted by a future president without the consent of Congress.
   Many moderate Republicans said the amendment represented a
partisan jab at President Reagan and his administration's
reinterpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to
permit the deployment of a Star Wars missile defense system.
   Several GOP lawmakers said the controversy may cause them to
reassess their support of the treaty and Cranston said he may be
willing to search for a compromise when the Senate debates the
issue.
   The treaty, signed Dec. 8 by President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, requires both sides to destroy, within three
years, all nuclear-armed missiles with a range of 300 miles to
3,400 miles.
   These include all Soviet SS-20 and other medium- and
shorter-range missiles aimed at targets in Western Europe and all
of the smaller force of U.S. Pershing 2 and ground-launched cruise
missiles stationed in Europe and aimed at the Soviet Union.
   The treaty is the first accord in the history of arms control to
require the actual destruction of the missiles that carry nuclear
warheads. And it is the first to require on-site inspection to
verify compliance with its terms.
   The Foreign Relations Committee voted after 21 days of hearings
in which scores of expert witnesses testified. The Senate
Intelligence and Armed Services committees also conducted an
intense examination of the agreement and recommended it be adopted,
the latter voting its approval, 18-2.
   The Armed Services Committee did express some lingering
concerns, and in final testimony on Wednesday, Ambassador Maynard
Glitman, the chief U.S. INF negotiator, responded to them.
   Glitman said ``futuristic'' weapons such as lasers and particle
beam generators are in fact banned by the treaty if they are
carried on ``weapons delivery vehicles'' within the prohibited
range.
   The Soviets, the ambassador said, ``understand that all future
(weapons) systems falling within the criteria will be banned.''
   And if an unarmed medium-range missile were to strike and
destroy a target through impact alone, it would be considered a
weapon if it had been designed for that purpose, he said.
   Later, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the Armed Services chairman, said
Glitman's statement had not resolved the issue and that he would
seek a more definitive clarification during Senate debate.
   Nunn said he might seek passage of an amendment to the treaty
requiring the administration to obtain a specific statement from
the Soviets acknowledging that they had agreed not to produce,
deploy or flight test futuristic medium-range weapons.
   Pell told a news conference this issue is one of several hurdles
facing the treaty on the Senate floor. He said he is hopeful all
obstacles can be overcome and the treaty ratified before Reagan's
summit meeting with Gorbachev in late May.
   If it is not, he said, Reagan will be embarrassed and in a
weakened position to pursue the far more significant Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty aimed at cutting U.S. and Soviet intercontinental
missile forces by up to 50 percent.
   Republican senators complained at length about the committee's
12-7 decision on Tuesday to add the provision aimed at ensuring
that administration testimony and official description of the
treaty is ``authoritative'' and binding.
   The provision says no future president can change the U.S.
interpretation of the treaty without congressional approval, either
by Senate ratification of a new treaty or by the House and Senate
passing a separate law.
   ``It very frankly may change my position in response to the
treaty,'' said Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., contending the measure
was aimed at the Strategic Defense Initiative and the
administration's reinterpretation of the ABM treaty.
   Cranston said the measure was worded to apply only to the INF
treaty, not to any other pact or to future accords.
   But Boschwitz insisted it was politically motivated. ``I think
we are making a great mistake. It weakens the value of the treaty
very substantially. I would hope that on the floor of the Senate we
would be able to remove this provision.''
   Pressler called the amendment, ``mischievous and partisan.''
   ``It will lead to the defeat of this treaty entirely because
(with it), the votes aren't there,'' he said.

<HEAD>New UPI Executives Announce `Turnaround' Effort</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new executives of United Press
International said Wednesday that they intend to turn the
deficit-plagued news service into a profit-making organization
within two years by eliminating about 150 jobs, focusing on
business news and embarking on joint electronic ventures.
   ``There'll be no liquidation of UPI,'' declared chairman Earl W.
Brian.
   President Paul Steinle said UPI ``will remain a full-service,
24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week, worldwide supplier of news and
information.''
   The two executives, who gained operating control of UPI from
Mexican publisher Mario Vazquez Rana on Feb. 19, said they were
determined to reverse UPI's persistently heavy losses, which
average $2 million a month and totaled $20 million last year.
   Brian told a news conference in this Washington suburb that his
``turnaround business plan'' calls for stabilizing the company
within three to six months and making a $100,000 profit in the
July-September quarter of 1989.
   To achieve the turnaround, Brian said he expects to raise $15
million in permanent equity financing, mostly from outside
investors. In the meantime, he said, $5 million in bridge loans
will be made available by WNW Group Inc., aided by Infotechnology
Inc.
   Brian is chairman of WNW Group, the media investment company
that operates UPI, and of Infotech, a New York-based information
technology and venture capital firm.
   The UPI executives said they are committed to ensuring that the
81-year-old wire service survives and flourishes into the 21st
century.
   Vazquez Rana rescued UPI from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings
in June 1986 by purchasing the company for $41 million. He
reportedly put an additional $50 million into UPI before he
relinquished control of his stock for 10 years to Brian's WNW Group
in February for an undisclosed cash payment.
   The new executives said UPI will save $10 million in the first
year in administrative cost controls, $5 million in staff
reductions and $5 million in deficit financing.
   ``There have been published reports that 400 or more editorial
personnel alone would be laid off at UPI,'' Steinle said in a
statement. ``In fact, there will be fewer than 150 net staff
reductions, and less than 100 of those will be editorial. ... At
this time, we do not anticipate further cutbacks.''
   The executives said this means that the current 1,280 UPI
employees worldwide will be reduced 14 percent to about 1,130
employees through layoffs, early retirements and attrition. The
biggest percentage of layoffs will occur in administrative
positions, Brian said.
   Steinle said Wire Service Guild officers were briefed on the
plan Wednesday morning. ``Their response was polite,'' he said.
``They were interested, I think they were pleased.''
   Sean McCormally, chairman of the Guild's negotiating committee,
said the union agrees that UPI needs stability. ``We believe the
logical next step toward stability is for management to reach a
fair and equitable contract with its employees,'' he said. ``That
added stability should prove attractive to potential investors.''
   UPI officials said contract negotiations already had begun.
Guild members at UPI have been working without a contract since
April 30, when the old one expired. UPI management declared an
impasse in contract talks and instituted a new set of ``work
rules'' in November.
   McCormally said the union is happy that Steinle had promised no
further layoffs beyond the 150 announced Wednesday. ``But we are
insisting our members have the protections guaranteed by a contract
and by effective union representation,'' he said.
   The company executives stressed that the 180 UPI bureaus
worldwide will continue virtually unchanged.
   Asked how UPI would improve news coverage with fewer employees,
Steinle said the staff will be ``not as large but more focused,''
concentrating on stories most in demand by subscribers while
providing full coverage of the major stories of the day.
   Brian said no existing UPI services, such as photos or sports,
will be dropped, although he said money will be saved by
transferring a Spanish-language translation desk from UPI
headquarters in Washington to Latin America, possibly Mexico City.
   The executives said UPI will concentrate on areas with major
client support, such as state and regional reporting, and will
emphasize technical reporting that local news media are unable to
provide.
   ``This includes an increased emphasis on business and financial
news and analysis and its effect on the consumer, plus more and
better reporting in areas such as health, science, law and
medicine,'' Steinle said.
   Brian said UPI's ``patchwork quilt'' communications system will
be streamlined and its ``shoebox accounting system'' will be
modernized. He predicted additional savings by pooling UPI's
resources with those of other companies offering the potential for
joint ventures in the information industry.
   For example, he said that within the next few months, UPI will
be ready to take part in a new, low-cost electronic news and
information service called DBC SuperNews and to provide new
regional business and stocks reports around the country.
   Brian said SuperNews will allow anyone with a personal computer
at more than 28 million cable television sites to receive news on
any subject via satellite from Financial News Network, a 24-hour
cable TV network that is a subsidiary of Infotech.
   The news would be gathered by Comtex Scientific Corp. from UPI
and other major news sources in a venture also involving Data
Broadcasting Corp., an FNN subsidiary.
   Brian said UPI is looking at dozens of other possible ventures,
including data base and electronic feeds to corporate and
government users and serving as distributor for other information
products.
   UPI's national managing editor, Bill Ferguson, said one example
of how productivity will be increased is the use of a computer
system that can edit a story automatically in three separate styles
for newspapers, radio and television.
   ``We will still be the second major news service in the United
States, not quite as large as we were before, but certainly more
focused, with more business systems behind it, with more chances of
surviving over a longer period of time and hopefully with more
success,'' Steinle said.
   Said Brian: ``We have an established and successful track record
in turnaround management. We know how to operate companies within
their means and we have links to other companies with significant
future joint-venture potential for UPI in the information
industry.''
   Steinle said UPI will constantly assess market reaction to its
services. ``As a market-driven company, we will supply what the
market wants and is willing to pay for,'' he said.

<HEAD>Treasury Selling $2.5 Billion in Bonds to Mexico</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department announced Wednesday it
was selling $2.56 billion in 20-year bonds to the government of
Mexico as part of an innovative effort to help solve that country's
debt problems.
   Mexico will pay $492 million in cash for the zero-coupon bonds,
so-called because they are sold at a deep discount from the face
amount and pay no interest until they mature.
   The sale of the U.S. securities was the final step in an
innovative procedure unveiled last December. Mexico sought to
induce foreign banks to forgive a portion of their loans by
offering, in exchange, smaller quantities of Mexican government
bonds that would be backed by collateral consisting of U.S.
Treasury securities.
   Banks were asked to bid for the bonds, offering to cancel their
loans at a discount.
   Backers of the plan had hoped to reduce Mexico's debt burden by
up to $10 billion, but when the bids were opened on March 2, the
amount of debt reduction amounted to a disappointing $1.1 billion.
   The Mexican Finance Ministry rejected nearly half of the bids it
received as insufficient. The bids accepted would retire $3.66
billion in debt at an average discount of 67.66 cents on the
dollar, offering $2.56 billion worth of Mexican bonds in exchange.
   The $2.56 billion in zero-coupon bonds sold by U.S. Treasury on
Wednesday will be used as collateral to back up the Mexican bonds.

<HEAD>Lithotripsy Machine Effective On Small Kidney Stones, Panel Finds</HEAD>

   A machine that sends a shockwave into the body
to break up kidney stones is effective and less risky than invasive
surgery, a panel of experts concluded Wednesday following a
conference at the National Institutes of Health.
   The panel, organized to reach a consensus on how best to treat
and prevent kidney stones, recommended use of the extracorporeal
shockwave lithotriptor to treat kidney stones smaller than 2
centimeters in diameter. It said that a combination of therapies,
which may include surgery, may be needed for larger stones.
   The lithotriptor, introduced in the United States in 1984, uses
a fluid shockwave, generated by an electrical pulse, to break up
stones in the kidney or in the duct that drains the kidney. Once
the stones are broken up, they can be more easily passed out of the
body. The procedure routinely does not require surgery.
   More than a half million people have been treated with the
lithotriptor worldwide, the panel said, and it has been proven to
be effective.
   But the experts cautioned that because lithotriptsy is new,
``the long-term effects of the therapy are unknown.''
   Dr. Fredric L. Coe, a professor of medicine at the University of
Chicago and chairman of the panel, said there have been reports of
elevated blood pressure among some lithotriptsy patients, and there
have been cases where the therapy causes kidney injury. He said
these problems need to be further studied.
   For kidney stones larger than 2 centimeters, the panel
recommended the use of a combined therapy that would include a
surgical procedure called nephrolithotomy. Using this technique,
surgeons make a small incision near the kidney and then insert a
flexible tube that can be manuevered to the site of the kidney
stone. By manipulating instruments through the tube, the surgeon
can break up the kidney stone and remove it.
   Coe said the panel recommended a therapy system in which stones
larger than 2 centimeters would be removed by nephrolithotomy.
Small stones or fragments could then be treated with lithotripsy.
Later, if needed, a second removal surgery could be performed. He
said this combination was preferrable to repeated sessions of
lithotripsy.
   Open surgery, where a wide incision is made and the kidney
exposed, is required now only in rare cases involving special types
of stones or other physical factors, Coe said.
   Kidney stones account for seven to 10 of every 1,000 hospital
admissions in the United States. There are seven to 21 cases of
kidney stone annually for every 10,000 persons. Though the stones
may cause great pain, they are rarely life-threatening.
   Coe said about 70 percent of all kidney stone cases can be
treated using lithotripsy.
   For prevention of stones, the panel recommended the use of
medication for certain types of stones, a modification of diet
where indicated, and increased fluid intake. Increased urination,
caused by a higher fluid intake, the panel said, can lower the
concentration in the urine of chemicals that tend to form stones.
   Kidney stones are formed when chemicals in the urine crystalize.
About 80 percent of the stones are formed of calcium oxalate
crystals. Others are of calcium phosphate salts, uric acid, cystine
or a combination of magnesium, ammonium and phosphate.

<HEAD>FSU Students Design Clothing For Children With Medical Devices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fashion students at Florida State
University are putting their design talents to work for children
stuck with cumbersome or awkward medical devices.
   ``Parents of handicapped children buy ready-made clothes, then
slash them and cut them to make them fit,'' Emma Kittles, a
professor of clothing, textiles and merchandising said Wednesday.
``It's almost impossible to buy clothing to fit the devices their
children have to wear.''
   Kittles has challenged a class to design clothing that is
functional, comfortable and has style. Their results will be
compiled in a step-by-step teaching manual on designing clothing
for disabled children.
   Thinking of children 2 to 13, the students must design clothes
that would be easy to put on and would camouflage any medical
devices.
   For children in wheelchairs, the students must design outfits
that eliminate excess folds and bulk and that are made of fabrics
that don't chafe.
   Another challenge for the students is designing clothes that
make it easier for children to dress themselves with the help of
front or side fasteners, such as Velcro, large snaps and zippers
with large tabs.
   ``Children are at the stage that they are learning things to
make them independent; one of those things is dressing
themselves,'' said Kittles. ``But even if the child cannot dress
himself, the therapist and parents want clothing that is easy to
manipulate on these children.''
   Because each child's needs are different, the students will
interview the parents before measuring, buying fabrics and
designing outfits. The child also shares personal preferences, such
as favorite colors.

   The Roman Catholic patriarch of Jerusalem,
in a Vatican Radio interview Wednesday, appealed to Christians and
``responsible politicians'' to work for peace in the Holy Land.
   Monsignor Michel Sabbah, a Palestinian, said unrest in the
Israeli-occupied territories seemed worse as ``we celebrate Holy
Week by reflecting on the suffering of Christ and of the people of
Jerusalem and of all those in prison, dead, injured and suffering
from hunger.''
   He said the church could only pray and ``appeal to the whole
world, to all the responsible politicians ... to put an end to this
human tragedy that we have been living for so many years.''
   Sabbah, the first Arab patriarch for Latin rite Catholics in the
Holy Land, did not criticize either Israelis or Palestinians for
the violence, and said both groups were suffering.
   He told the station in the telephone interview that he did not
think the violence would disrupt Easter ceremonies in the region.
But he said is appealing to all Christians to pray that political
leaders can bring peace to the Holy Land.

<HEAD>EPA Head Bans Insecticide Used On Golf Courses</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Environmental Protection
Agency has overruled a hearing examiner and banned use of the
insecticide diazinon on golf course and sod farms in an effort to
protect birds, EPA said Wednesday.
   Agency administrator Lee M. Thomas said the major manufacturer,
Ciba-Geigy Corp. of Greensboro, N.C., had ``failed to show by a
preponderance of the evidence that even a single acre of turf will
be destroyed if diazinon is canceled, much less that golf course or
sod farm operations will be significantly affected by turf
replacement costs.''
   EPA spokesman Al Heier said it was the first time EPA had acted
against a pesticide solely to protect birds, though the harm to
birds was one reason DDT was banned in 1972.
   Chief Administrative Law Judge Gerald Harwood in January upheld
Ciba-Geigy's contention that the benefits of use under additional
restrictions outweighed the risk to birds.
   But Thomas's decision, signed Tuesday and released Wednesday,
said the company's benefits case was ``singularly weak.''
   ``Ciba-Geigy's contention that the risk (to birds under new
restrictions) would be low is undermined by the critical flaws in
its field studies,'' Thomas wrote.
   Even disregarding those flaws, some risk to birds would remain,
Thomas said, and ``these risks are not justified by the benefit of
avoiding a negligible cost increase to golf courses and sod farms.''
   Other insect control measures should add less than 0.5 percent
to operating costs of golf courses and sod farms, Thomas said.
   He said that ``unblemished golf courses and lawns are not as
significant as the benefits to public health programs and food
crops'' normally at issue in pesticide decisions.
   Evidence of the benefits of maintaining price competition among
products, avoiding turf damage and the comparative safety of
diazinon ``is either nonexistent, speculative or in conflict with
more persuasive evidence,'' Thomas wrote.
   Many bird species find golf courses and sod farms good feeding
grounds, especially in urban areas where these large expanses of
green are easy to spot from the air. They ingest the chemical both
from the insects they eat and from directly eating small pellets of
the chemical.
   The agency has said it knows of 60 instances in 18 states of
bird kills where diazinon was the known or suspected cause.
Anywhere from one to 800 birds were killed in these cases, and EPA
believes the deaths are significantly underestimated.
   Diazinon has other uses on farms, in nurseries and in gardens
that are not affected by Thomas' ruling. About 8 million pounds a
year are sold, of which 512,000 pounds is used on golf courses and
60,000 pounds on sod farms, the agency said. Diazinon is contained
in 494 licensed pesticide products.
   Ciba-Geigy spokesman Skip Ragland said the company still
believed its product could be used safely, but had not had time to
study Thomas' decision. The company could begin a court appeal, but
``we don't know yet how far we're going to take this,'' Ragland
said.
   Maureen Hinkle, a lobbyist for the National Audubon Society,
praised Thomas' decision and noted that other pesticides frequently
kill birds.
   ``We hope it will be a precedent for other pesticide decisions
affecting birds,'' she said.

   Sikh radicals killed 15 more people in
Punjab, bringing the death toll to 50 in three days of attacks
linked to their violent separatist campaign, police reported
Wednesday.
   Attacks blamed on Sikh militants have taken at least 580 lives
already this year in Punjab, India's main agricultural region and
the only state where Sikhs are the majority. The death toll for all
of 1987 was about 1,000.
   This week's violence has included the first successful use of
rocket-propelled grenades against police. Izhar Alam, the Punjab
police chief, said he believes arms are being smuggled in from
Pakistan.
   Seven people killed Tuesday night were members of two Sikh
families in the Amritsar district adjacent to Pakistan, Alam said.
   Many attacks involve random fire. On Monday night, gunmen killed
10 people at a Sikh wedding party, including the bride and groom. A
survivor said the raiders shouted that family members were police
informers.
   Although members of the sect have a majority in Punjab, Sikhs
make up only 2 percent of India's 800 million people, more than 80
percent of whom are Hindus.
   Targets of the Sikh gunmen include moderate Sikhs who oppose a
separate state, as well as Hindus. At least 328 of this year's
victims have been Sikhs.
   An increasing worry for Punjabi authorities is the more powerful
weaponry being introduced, including grenade launchers and AK-47
assault rifles.
   No casualties were reported in the first attack with
rocket-propelled grenades, made on a police barracks last week. On
Tuesday night, however, 10 men were wounded by grenades fired at a
truck carrying paramilitary personnel of the Border Security Force
in the Gurdaspur district north of Amritsar.
   Police found an underground arms cache in the Amritsar district
Sunday that included 14 Soviet-made RPG-7 launchers along with
HE-80 anti-tank grenades, said S.S. Virk, a senior officer of the
paramilitary Central Reserve Police.
   Alam's claim that arms have come from Pakistan conforms with
Indian allegations that Pakistan arms the militants, a charge the
government in Islamabad denies.

   The rightist Arena party has
withdrawn from vote counting in the March 20 election, claiming
others are trying to deprive it of victory, officials said
Wednesday.
   Election officials announced soon after the election that Arena,
an abbreviation of Republican Nationalist Alliance, had defeated
the Christian Democratic Party of President Jose Napoleon Duarte.
   It appeared at the time that Arena would get at least 31 of the
60 National Assembly seats under the system of proportional
representation, with about 22 being assigned to Christian Democrats.
   Arena left the count Tuesday night by taking its representative
off the three-member Central Elections Council, which does the
tallying. It was protesting a council decision to consider
challenges to the elections of three Arena candidates.
   Francisco Merino, the party's council representative, said the
other members wanted to make a ``game of the vote tallies in order
to change the results of the elections.''
   The other members are the council president, Mario Samayoa of
the Christian Democrats, and Arturo Mendez Azahar of the
conservative National Conciliation Party. Two votes are enough to
approve any decision.
   Roberto d'Aubuisson, the former army major who founded Arena,
told reporters recently that if his party did not receive 31 seats
it would be a case of ``fraud and we will withdraw from this
democratic process.''
   Alfredo Cristiani, president of Arena, said in a television
interview Wednesday: ``The people are being defrauded. This could
explode at any moment, something difficult to stop (could) occur.''
   In a recent interview, Samayoa denied the accusation of fraud in
the vote-counting, which he said ``only exists in the mind of those
who have manipulated the information about the results in their
favor.''
   He said officials completed the official tallies and assignment
of seats last Saturday for 11 of the 14 provinces, but some
recounts would be needed in the other three because of challenges.
   The Arena upset presented Duarte, a staunch U.S. ally, with dim
prospects for his last year in office. Presidential elections are
set for March 1989.
   Arena benefited from popular discontent about Duarte's failure
to meet his 1984 campaign pledges of improving the economy and
ending the 8-year-old civil war with leftist guerrillas.
   Both unemployement and the annual inflation rate are estimated
at 40 percent.

<HEAD>Rep. Howard's Death Could Cause Public Works Committee Shifts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death of Chairman James Howard of the
House Public Works and Transportation Committee paves the way for a
relatively obscure Californian to take over the panel, and for
possible shifts among subcommittee leaders.
   Rep. Glenn Anderson of Los Angeles is acting chairman of the
public works panel and its ranking Democrat. Anderson's top aide,
Jeremiah Bresnahan, asked Wednesday if the lawmaker would want to
become the panel's permanent chairman, said, ``I can't imagine he
wouldn't want to be.''
   Other legislators and committee aides, asking to not be
identified, said it appeared certain that Anderson would become
committee chairman, probably next month, and that he was not likely
to be challenged for the job.
   Anderson, 75, is a former California lieutenant governor who was
elected to the House in 1968. He is a strong union supporter who
has been an advocate for many projects the committee oversees, but
he has been one of the least visible members of the panel's
leadership.
   The real question is whether Anderson will choose to retain his
chairmanship of the surface transportation subcommittee when he
takes control of the entire committee. That subcommittee, which
oversees enormous highway, water and mass transit programs, is
generally considered the most desirable on the committee.
   Under House rules, Anderson could retain both posts.
   Robert Maitlin, an aide to Rep. Robert Roe, D-N.J., who ranks
behind Anderson in seniority, said it is ``very doubtful'' Roe
would give up his chairmanship of the Science, Space and Technology
Committee to take over the surface transportation subcommittee.
   Rep. Norman Mineta, D-Calif., said he might be interested in
heading the surface transportation subcommittee if Anderson vacated
the job. Mineta now chairs the committee's aviation subcommittee.
   House Democratic rules call for a nominee to head a committee to
be selected by the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, a
panel of 31 Democratic representatives dominated by the party's
leadership. That selection must then be approved by a vote of the
257 Democrats in the House, and then by the entire House.
   The 60-year-old Howard, D-N.J., died last Friday, a day after
being stricken with a heart attack while playing golf in suburban
Maryland.

Pesticide</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Environmental Protection Agency scientists can
foresee no risk to humans or other organisms from a proposed field
test in Maryland of a new genetically engineered pesticide, the
agency said Wednesday.
   The pesticide, if eventually approved, would be used against the
European corn borer.
   Crop Genetics Inc. of Hanover, Md., applied to both EPA and the
Agriculture Department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
to test the new substance on its farm near Ingleside, Md., and at
the Agriculture Department's research station at Beltsville, Md.
   The report by microbiologists and plant pathologists from the
hazard evaluation divison of EPA's pesticides office said the
properties of the engineered organism and results of lab tests on
mice ``indicate that there are no human health risks.''
   The report said it is difficult to transfer the organism from
one plant to another except on the blades of cutting tools, and the
engineered organism eventually should die out in competition with
the natural strain.
   ``For this small-scale field test, providing all the
containment, monitoring and contingency procedures are adhered to,
we can foresee no risk to non-target insects and no effect on
endangered species,'' and the organism may be used, the group said.
   The report will be considered at a public meeting April 18 of a
subcommittee of EPA's pesticide scientific advisory panel. The
panel's report is expected in time for a decision on the permits in
May.

<HEAD>US Official Says Philippine Rebels Demoralized; Alleges Soviet
Support</HEAD>

   A senior Pentagon official said Wednesday the
Soviet Union has been sending money to Philippine insurgents, but
he said the rebels' growth is slowing and they are not now
targeting Americans in the country.
   Richard L. Armitage, assistant secretary for international
security affairs, also praised the capture Tuesday of several top
communist rebel leaders in the Philippines, saying, ``This has to
have a devastating effect on the morale'' of the New People's Army.
   Armitage told a congressional subcommittee hearing that he found
``dramatic differences'' during a recent visit to Manila, compared
to one 18 months earlier.
   He said President Corazon Aquino's government now has people who
genuinely care about the health of the nation. The debate in
Manila, he said, is no longer over whether the president will
survive coup attempts but how successful she will be during the
rest of her term, which ends in 1992.
   Asked by Rep. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., whether there has been any
Soviet support for the rebels, Armitage said, ``In terms of
equipment, none. In terms of money, sure.''
   In the first public claim by an administration official that
there is Soviet support for Philippine rebels, Armitage said Soviet
money goes to the Communist Party of the Philippines and is then
funneled to the New People's Army. He gave no other details.
   Armitage said that the up to 16,000 armed and another 10,000
unarmed rebels also receive money from groups in Europe, Australia,
New Zealand and the United States, and they are known to have held
discussions with North Korean and Vietnamese representatives.
   No outside group is known to have sent arms to the rebels since
a shipment of about 150 weapons by the Palestine Liberation
Organization in the early 1980s, he said.
   The defense official said growth of the insurgency has been
about 2 percent annually, compared to 20 percent during the last
year of President Ferdinand E. Marcos' regime, which was replaced
by Mrs. Aquino's government in a February 1986 revolt.
   He noted that no American servicemen have been killed in the
Philippines since two American airmen and a retired U.S. soldier
were gunned down last October.
   Communist rebels claimed responsibility for the killings and
said more U.S. soldiers would be killed. But Armitage said he
believes it was the work of a local rebel group that backfired and
not the result of a communist central committee policy.
   Assistant Secretary of State Gaston J. Sigur appeared before the
Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations to defend
administration proposals for $257 million in aid for fiscal 1989.
This is $90 million less than Congress appropriated for the
Philippines last year.
   Sigur noted there are also congressional proposals for the
United States to lead an international effort to raise $5 billion
for the Philippines over the next five years.
   He also pointed to the possibility of additional aid in
connection with the agreement allowing U.S. use of Clark Air Base,
Subic Navy Base and other military facilities in the Philippines. A
review of the bases agreement begins in Manila next week, with
money a key issue.

<TEXT>
   The Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal has
sharply curtailed hearings because of Iranian claims that Iraqi
missile attacks are keeping its lawyers and witnesses from
appearing in The Hague, sources said.
   The 6-year-old tribunal is charged with arbitrating billions of
dollars of U.S. and Iranian financial claims arising from the 1979
Islamic revolution which overthrew the late Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi.
   Three of four scheduled hearings have been canceled since March
7 at Iranian request.
   One Western source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Wednesday that the cancellations mean only one claim is expected to
be heard by the nine-judge tribunal between March 7 through May 25.
   No hearings are set during the Moslem holy month of Ramadan from
April 18-May 20.
   Current cases have taken at least six years to reach the hearing
docket, which is set months in advance.
   Both Iraq and Iran have been engaging in missile attacks on
population centers in their 7{-year-old war.
   In a major case involving the Delaware firm Combustion
Engineering Co., the Iranian agent to the tribunal, Mohammed K.
Eshragh, wrote the tribunal that ``representatives and attorneys in
the above-mentioned case cannot travel to The Hague due to the
present circumstances prevailing in Iran.''
   He requested cancellation of the hearing, a tribunal source said
Wednesday. The request was granted March 22.
   That case, scheduled for an April 11-13 hearing, involved a
claim against the Iranian government and two of its agencies for
engineering and inspection services provided to steel mills in Iran.
   Eshragh has refused official comment on the situation in Tehran,
but tribunal sources _ speaking on condition of anonymity _ said he
recently claimed Iraqi missile attacks had forced evacuation of 1
million residents from the capital, a city of approximately 6
million.
   The sources said Eshragh claimed Iranian attorneys were
unreachable and airline service from Tehran was disrupted.
   Eshragh was not available for comment at the Bureau of Iranian
Legal Services in The Hague.
   Officials at the tribunal have tried to verify independently
Eshragh's claim that Iranian parties to the cases were unavailable.
   ``The independent sources that we have seen ... would support
the statement made by the Iranian agent,'' said a tribunal source.
   Other hearings canceled included one scheduled April 15 on a
claim by the Silver Springs, Md., firm of Tadjer-Cohen Associates
Inc. against an Iranian government bank. The claim involved an
undetermined amount of unpaid invoices for supervision of an
Iranian construction project. The hearing was called off March 24.
   A March 9-10 hearing in a case brought by Fairfield, Conn.-based
General Electric Corp. was called off March 8. That claim, brought
against the Iranian government and several of its agencies, sought
millions of dollars in compensation for aircraft engine parts
shipped to Iran.
   Still on schedule is a hearing April 14 involving a claim by the
California firm Near East Technological Services USA, Inc. against
the Iranian air force for unpaid spare parts shipments.
   The tribunal source said that hearing has apparently not been
canceled because it will be handled by Iranian lawyers already in
The Hague.
   The tribunal has so far awarded about $1 billion to American
claimants and about $60 million to Iranians, plus an undetermined
amount of interest to claimants on both sides.
   The arbitration panel was established by the 1981 Algiers
Accords, which brought freedom to American hostages held at the
U.S. Embassy in Tehran for 444 days in 1979-81.
   It is the only known forum for official contacts between U.S.
and Iranian officials.

   A bomb exploded near the South African Embassy here
Wednesday, a few hours after police arrested more than 80 people
protesting the assassination of an African National Congress
official.
   In the southern port city of Marseille, at least six gunshots
were fired Tuesday night at a building in front of the South
African Consulate. The gunmen fled in a car and no arrests were
made.
   No injuries were reported from the bomb which exploded about 3
a.m. Wednesday at a Paris office building a few blocks from the
embassy. Police said no claim of responsiblity had been received.
   Late Tuesday night, police arrested 41 demonstrators who broke
into and smashed the South African Tourism office, and 46 others
who painted anti-apartheid slogans on the home of the South African
ambassador in Paris.
   Police identified the protesters only as young leftists who
supported the ANC. All but four were released overnight.
   They were protesting the slaying of Dulcie September, 53, the
ANC representative to France, Switzerland and Luxembourg, who was
found dead Tuesday outside the door of the ANC's Paris office. She
had been shot in the face.
   Police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said at the
time that the killing looked like ``the work of a professional.''
   The ANC, the main guerrilla group fighting the apartheid
government of South Africa, blamed Pretoria for September's death.
The South African government denied responsibility and said the
attack was related to strife within the ANC, which was banned by
South Africa in 1960.
   A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said Tuesday that no claim
of responsiblity had been received.
   In Marseille, the gunshots were fired at 11:15 p.m. Tuesday at
the windows of a building in front of the consulate. The building
was painted with the slogan, ``Botha, assassin, SS,'' a reference
to South African President P.W. Botha and to Adolf Hitler's elite
guard, the most powerful instrument of Nazi power.
   About 1,000 people marched peacefully in a separate protest in
Paris Tuesday evening.
   President Francois Mitterrand said Tuesday he would ask South
Africa about the attack and reaffirmed his ``condemnation of the
regime of racial segregation.''
   A colleague of Ms. September's claimed that she had requested
protection from the Interior Ministry after receiving death threats
and being followed. The Interior Ministry denied that Ms. September
had requested protection.
   ``If she had asked, we would have given it to her,'' a ministry
spokeswoman said.
   Ms. September came to Paris after spending five years in a South
African prison for her outspoken criticism of apartheid.
   Ms. September's sister, Stephanie Arendse, said that after she
was released from prison ``she became quiet and didn't talk about
her politics so much.''
   In an interview published Wednesday in the South African daily,
the Cape Times, Mrs. Arendse said the family was uncertain whether
Ms. September's body would be returned to South Africa for burial.
   Ms. September, the oldest of three daughters and a teacher by
training, was tried in 1963 along with 10 others for treason and
sabotage and sentenced in 1964 to five years in prison, at the age
of 29.
   On her release in 1969 she was placed under house arrest and
confined to Wynburg, in northern Cape province.
   Mrs. Arendse said her sister left South Africa on an exit visa
in 1973 and settled in London, where she attended a nursing school.
   She was an administrative secretary at the ANC's Lusaka, Zambia,
headquarters and served in other capacities before 1984, when she
became representative for France, Luxembourg and Switzerland.
   An ANC spokesman on Tuesday called Ms. September one of the
organization's ``most vigorous activists.''

<TEXT>
   Jean and Leonard Peck, having
breakfast Wednesday with Democratic presidential candidate Albert
Gore, said they didn't mind having that media crowd in their
kitchen _ they'd seen it all before.
   Exactly 12 years earlier, a Georgia peanut farmer, Jimmy Carter,
had visited the Wisconsin dairy farm family on his way to the White
House.
   ``I guess we have a popular farm,'' Leonard Peck, 67, said after
Gore, his press entourage and Secret Service agents left. ``It's a
lot of work, but it's a thrill,'' said his wife. ``I think it
worked better this time because we had been through it before.''
   Gore, a senator from Tennessee, spent Tuesday night at the Peck
farm. He put on work clothes and helped prepare cows for milking
and put straw in animal stalls before joining the family for a
breakfast of pancakes, sausage and a family specialty made with
cornflakes, ice cream, strawberries and cream.
   Gore's farm background came through. ``You could tell that he
knew his way around the farm and he could handle a fork and acted
at home with the cows,'' Leonard Peck said.

<HEAD>Gore Aide Questions Jackson's Plan To Deliver Easter Sermon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An aide to presidential hopeful Albert Gore says
Jesse Jackson may be using Easter as a ``political pulpit'' if he
solicits campaign funds during a sermon Sunday.
   ``If we were to use Easter Sunday as a political pulpit, you
guys in the newspapers would beat us to death,'' Mike Veit, Gore's
Colorado campaign coordinator, told The Denver Post Tuesday.
   ``If we went in and raised money in a Sunday church service,
you'd beat us up even worse,'' added Veit, stressing his comments
reflected his views and not those of Gore.
   Colorado's presidential caucuses will be held the day after
Easter, and campaign staffers for Gore, a senator from Tennessee,
and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis have been reluctant to
schedule big political events for the religious weekend.
   Jackson is to deliver a sermon Sunday at the First Baptist
Church in Denver's Capitol Hill, where the pastor says Jackson's
appearance will be part of a worship service, not a political
rally. But the pastor says three collections will be taken _ one
for the churches, one for missionary work, and one for Jackson's
campaign.

<HEAD>Democrats Offering Political Plums For Corporate Donations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats are soliciting corporate donations to
help pay for their national convention in Atlanta this summer, and
they're offering some political plums in return.
   A four-color brochure sent out this week to 600 corporations in
Georgia and the Southeast offers tickets to the convention, choice
hotel rooms, transportation and exclusive parties to those willing
to chip in.
   ``This convention provides a unique opportunity for corporations
to get their message across to governors, members of Congress,
foreign ambassadors,'' says Nancy Parrish, a fund-raising
consultant who helped design the convention sales package.
   A $15,000 contributor would get two convention tickets, access
to a hospitality suite, rooms at area hotels and seats on VIP buses
running between hotels and the convention site.
   For $200,000, a contributor will receive floor seats or a
skybox, a private reception room, more hotel rooms, exclusive
parties and limousine service.

<HEAD>Dukakis Leads Jackson, Bush In Poll Of New Yorkers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A poll says Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
leads Jesse Jackson among Democrats likely to vote in New York's
April 19 primary but Jackson has an edge among those strongly
committed to a candidate.
   According to a Chicago Sun-Times-Gallup Poll released Tuesday,
Dukakis was the only Democrat to lead Vice President George Bush
among New York voters. In general election matchups, Dukakis led
Bush 49 percent to 41 percent, while Bush led Jackson 55 percent to
31 percent.
   Of the New York Democrats interviewed, 44 percent preferred
Dukakis, 28 percent favored Jackson, 3 percent chose Tennessee Sen.
Albert Gore and 2 percent backed Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois.
   But only 14 percent of Democrats who said they were strongly
committed to a candidate planned to vote for Dukakis, while 21
percent favored Jackson.
   The results were based on telephone interviews with 1,205
registered New York voters conducted between Friday and Sunday. The
sample included 421 likely to vote in the Democratic primary and
329 in the Republican primary. The margin of error was 5 percent
among Democrats and 3 percent for general election matchups.

   A fast-moving storm brewing in the southwestern United States
dumped up to a half a foot of snow on parts of Utah on Wednesday
and threatened Wyoming and Colorado with heavy snow.
   Utah's higher elevations got 6 inches of snow before skies
cleared Wednesday afternoon. Salt Lake City received 3 inches of
snow in six hours; in Utah's western desert, Tooele got 5 inches.
   Snow advisories were issued through Thursday morning for
southwest Utah and the northern and central mountains of Colorado,
where up to 8 inches was expected. A winter storm watch also was
posted for south-central and southeastern Wyoming, where up to 10
inches of snow was forecast.
   Farther south, showers and thunderstorms developed along a
stationary front extending from Texas' lower Rio Grande Valley
across Louisiana into Mississippi.
   The eastern United States continued to enjoy unseasonably warm
weather, with highs in the 70s from the central and eastern Gulf
Coast to the Middle Atlantic States.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the six-hour period ending at 1 p.m.
EST included 1.56 inches at Alexandria, La., and 1.29 inches at
Baton Rouge, La.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 24
degrees at Yellowstone Park, Wyo., to 87 at the Southwest Regional
Airport in Fort Myers, Fla. The early morning low for the nation
was 3 degrees above zero at International Falls, Minn.
   Thursday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms
extending from the southern and central Appalachians through the
mid-Mississippi Valley and across much of the southern and central
Plains. Rain was expected from Kentucky and Tennessee into Kansas,
Oklahoma and northern Texas. Snow was forecast for the central
Rockies and the central high Plains, eastern Colorado and western
Nebraska. Fair skies should prevail over the rest of the nation.
   High temperatures should be below 50 degrees from much of the
Rockies to the upper Great Lakes, including highs only in the 30s
and upper 20s from northern Arizona across much of Colorado and
Wyoming to western South Dakota. Highs should reach in the 60s and
70s from the southern and central Pacific Coast through southern
Arizona and the southern high Plains to the southern and
mid-Atlantic Coast, and in the 50s in most of the rest of the
nation.

<HEAD>Marcos To Philippines: I'll Be Back</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ferdinand Marcos, the exiled former president of
the Philippines, says negotiations for a return to his homeland are
under way and he will likely go back ``very soon,'' a published
report said.
   ``If I have a political role to play, we will negotiate that
later,'' Marcos was quoted as saying in the latest edition of Paris
Match, which goes on sale Thursday.
   The Philippine government has said it sent emissaries to talk to
Marcos in January and February. Mrs. Aquino has said that before
Marcos returns, he must give back billions of dollars he allegedly
stole during his 20-year rule. Marcos has denied stealing any money.
   ``Negotiations have started between the government of Mrs.
(Corazon) Aquino and myself,'' Marcos was quoted as saying in an
interview in his exile home in Honolulu. ``These negotiations are
continuing at this moment and going very well. I hope that we can
very quickly set the date of my return, as well as the conditions.''
   Asked when he would return, he responded, ``Man proposes and God
disposes ... I will be going home very soon,'' the magazine said.
   Marcos fled the Philippines during a civilian-military revolt in
the wake of fraud-tainted Feb. 7, 1986 presidential elections in
which both he and Mrs. Aquino claimed victory. Mrs. Aquino revoked
his passport.
   In the Paris Match interview, Marcos was quoted as expressing
his admiration ``for the way Mrs. Aquino is confronting all sorts
of problems.'' But he also expressed fears that her government
could soon disintegrate.
   ``The communists will then have a free field to immediately take
power,'' he is quoted as telling the weekly photo magazine, in a
reference to leftist rebels.
   ``For me the only way to make a contribution to national unity
is to return to my country, with respect for all conditions we can
agree to.''
   Marcos also is quoted as saying that he needs to return for
health reasons, especially old war wounds acting up, and to settle
lawsuits filed against him since he was deposed.

<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

   Michael Dukakis cautiously began speaking of differences between
himself and Jesse Jackson on the Middle East and domestic policy
Wednesday, signaling a delicate new phase in their struggle for
supremacy in the Democratic presidential race. Jackson and
Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. tangled more openly.
   Jackson canceled a planned meeting with Gore on Wednesday,
citing comments Gore made about him the day before, which he called
``more personal than principled.'' Gore, sounding irritated,
responded: ``There is no reason why anyone should think Jesse
Jackson ought to be treated differently from any other candidate in
this race.''
   Gore had said Jackson did not have the experience necessary for
the presidency.
   Fellow presidential hopeful Paul Simon said he, too, has better
credentials for the White House than Jackson, and spoke frankly
about the dilemma that has plagued Democrats since Jackson moved to
the front ranks of the presidential contenders. ''You have to be
careful. You don't want to be perceived as anti-black,'' he said.
   Jackson, an outsider if there ever was one, broke bread with the
inner circle of the Democratic party establishment in Washington.
He said it showed that ``old wineskins are expanding and making
room for new wine.'' But a congressional supporter said he detected
the beginnings of a ``stop-Jackson'' movement taking hold elsewhere.
   The Democrats who met with Jackson said they wanted no part of
that. But Florida party chairman Charles Whitehead said, ``I would
be less than honest with you if I didn't tell you there is
absolutely an awful lot of apprehension out there among an awful
lot of Democrats about the nomination of Jesse Jackson.''
   Jackson scored a landslide victory over Dukakis in the Michigan
caucuses last weekend that stunned some party leaders.
   Some of them say privately they fear that if nominated, the
black, liberal former civil rights leader would lead Democrats to
an election-day loss that might jeopardize Democratic control of
the Congress. On the other hand, party leaders are afraid of
offending the millions of black voters Jackson brings to the polls,
knowing that their support will be needed to produce a general
election victory.
   Dukakis regained his footing with a victory in Connecticut's
primary Tuesday night by a margin of 2-1 over Jackson, and holds a
narrow lead in convention delegates, 647 to 634. Gore trails with
364. It takes 2,082 delegates to win the nomination.
   The Democratic maneuverings in advance of Monday's Colorado
caucuses and Tuesday's Wisconsin primary contrasted sharply with
the serenity on the Republican side.
   Bob Dole reassumed the mantle of Republican Senate leader
following his withdrawal from the presidential race. He went to the
White House and told President Reagan he was ``reporting back for
duty.''
   In an interview, he said he made serious tactical mistakes in
his campaign, but he added that the real problem was ``you can't
beat Ronald Reagan.''
   ``I was running against Ronald Reagan Jr. in the South,'' he
said in a reference to Vice President George Bush who campaigned as
Reagan's right-hand man.
   Bush campaigned in Wisconsin, but he hardly needed to. Former
television evangelist Pat Robertson is his only remaining rival,
and the only question left is when the vice president will garner
the final delegates needed to clinch the nomination.
   But there was enough twisting and turning on the Democratic side
for both parties.
   Dukakis, under pressure from party officials to develop a more
compelling campaign message, spoke for the first time of
differences between himself and Jackson.
   ``From time to time differences will arise. ... We have
differences over the Middle East, we have differences about certain
aspects of domestic policy, and how to build a strong economy, how
to create good jobs and those will come out over time,'' he said on
CBS' ``This Morning.'' He didn't elaborate.
   Dukakis wasn't the only one jabbing at Jackson.
   Sen. Simon, who needs a strong finish in Wisconsin, clearly had
Jackson in mind when he said, ``I offer not only passion, but
programs. ... I am here. I have been fighting for (workers')
policies on the Washington scene, not just in speeches.''
   Gore, who took issue with Jackson on Middle East and other
issues on Tuesday, said Wednesday that his remarks were ``really
not that different from what I've been saying for several months.''
   Gore had said in New York the day before that Jackson has a
``complete and total lack'' of experience needed to be president.
   The Tennessee senator, who has done poorly since he won several
states on Super Tuesday, campaigned in Wisconsin, and said, ``I
think we're going to surprise some people in this state.''
   Jackson himself expressed pleasure at his breakfast meeting with
party leaders from around the country, including former chairman
John White, one-time Defense Secretary Clark Clifford and other
Democratic insiders.
   White called it a ``bonding of the Democratic party'' and said
the subject of Jackson dragging the party down to defeat was
discussed ``not at all.''
   But someone at the table asked Jackson about the 1984
controversy that surrounded his relationship with black extremist
Louis Farrakhan. White said Jackson ``quoted Jesus about casting
the first stone and forgiveness and so anybody who hasn't made
mistakes ... let's not be casting stones at each other about the
past.''
   Jackson himself said he saw no evidence of a concerted movement
to stop his nomination.
   But Rep. Mickey Leland of Texas, a supporter, said he did.
   ``There is some movement afoot,'' Leland said. ``We can't put
our hands on it. We don't know who the leader is. But we do
understand ... different players of the Democratic Party have been
approached.''
   He named Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk, and House
Speaker James Wright as among those approached. Contacted later,
Kirk and a spokesman for Wright said they had not been approached
about stopping Jackson.

   Several of the largest insurance companies are
offering sharp discounts in premiums for drivers of cars with air
bags, the safety devices that inflate and protect a driver in a
serious accident.
   USAA, the country's sixth largest insurance company, announced
Wednesday a premium discount of up to 60 percent for personal
injury and medical coverage for air bag-equipped cars.
   The company also said it would contribute $300 to the purchase
or lease of a 1988 car equipped with an air bag.
   State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. on Tuesday announced
a premium discount of from $3 to $24 for cars equipped with air
bags or passive belts, which automatically wrap around a car
occupant.
   Robert F. McDermott, chairman of USAA, told a news conference he
expected air bags to be available as an option or standard
equipment in several million cars within the next 18 months.
   ``With safety belt use levels of 50 percent, we estimate we will
annually save 4,400 lives and prevent 73,000 moderate to critical
injuries,'' he said. ``With air bags and a 50 percent belt use
rate, the number of lives saved doubles to 8,800 and injury
reduction more than doubles to 151,000.''
   The auto industry in the past has complained that while
insurance companies have campaigned to get air bags into cars they
have not offered car owners financial incentives to order the
safety devices.

<HEAD>Judicial Panel Sets Aside Injunction Barring Army Random Drug
Testing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A preliminary injunction barring random drug
testing of 9,400 civilian Army employees was set aside by a federal
appellate court Tuesday while it considers the Justice Department's
appeal of a lower court order.
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here
granted a stay that was sought by the Justice Department of the
preliminary injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Thomas F.
Hogan on March 1.
   Hogan had ordered the Army to stop random urine testing of
civilian Army employees, finding that the practice was an
``excessively intrusive'' search prohibited by the Constitution.
   The preliminary injunction was issued in a case brought by
public employee unions representing civilian Army employees at Ft.
Stewart, Fla.; Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md.; and the Sharp Army
Depot in Lathrop, Calif.
   The injunction banned random testing of all 9,400 civilians in
sensitive jobs who were subject to the anti-drug program, including
pilots, guards and police officers on military bases.
   In issuing the injunction, Hogan had expressed regret that it
``removes what might be a powerful weapon from the nation's arsenal
in the campaign against illegal drug use, but the values
represented by the Constitution and Fourth Amendment are
transcendent.''
   Citing a legal precedent that allows stays of judicial decisions
when a party is likely to prevail on the merits of a dispute,
Circuit Judges Stephen Williams, James Buckley and D.H. Ginsburg
said ``a stay is warranted in this case.''
   Kenneth T. Blaylock, president of the American Federation of
Government Employees, expressed disappointment that the appellate
judges had set aside the injunction against random testing. He said
the union was ``determined to continue its fight to protect
employee rights under the Constitution.''
   Justice Department spokesman Amy Brown said the department was
pleased with the court's decision to stay Hogan's order. The Army
had no immediate comment.
   No date has been set for a hearing on the department's appeal in
the case.

<TEXT>
   For the second time in her career,
flight attendant Nancy Holt has given cardiopulmonary resuscitation
to save a stricken passenger.
   This time, John D. Farmer Jr., 62, of Jacksonville had run to
catch his flight Monday from Atlanta to Jacksonville and arrived at
the plane just before it began taxiing from the gate at Atlanta's
Hartsfield International Airport.
   He asked if he could sit in the first-class section until he
caught his breath, Ms. Holt said. Noting his heavy breathing and
gray color, Ms. Holt asked if he wanted oxygen.
   ``He said yes, took a few breaths and toppled over,'' she said.
The plane was taxiing toward the runway at the time.
   ``That man weighed over 200 pounds,'' said John Fors, an Atlanta
businessman who was aboard the plane. ``That 110-pound lady pulled
him off the seat and began CPR.''
   Ms. Holt, who has worked for Delta Air Lines for 10 years,
remembers wondering as she pulled Farmer to the cabin floor how she
would move him.
   ``I got the strength from somewhere,'' she said. ``I put him on
the floor and he was dead; there was no pulse and no breath.''
   In the meantime, Ms. Holt's supervisor called rescue personnel
at the airport.
   An unidentified doctor aboard the plane assisted her in
continuing CPR, Ms. Holt said. Paramedics revived the man, however,
Ms. Holt said.
   ``He was clinically dead,'' said Mark Johnson, an Atlanta Fire
Bureau paramedic. ``We helped save his life,'' but he stressed that
Ms. Holt's quick action was primarily responsible.
   ``That person deserves equal praise or more.''
   Farmer told Johnson he had been discharged from a hospital just
five weeks ago with a heart problem and had exerted too much effort
trying to catch the plane.
   About eight or nine years ago, Ms. Holt revived a passenger who
had suffered a heart attack aboard a Delta flight, she said.
   CPR proficiency is part of flight attendant's training, she
said, and ``you never forget it.''

<TEXT>
   The Senate passed 62-28 on Wednesday a bill
designed to revitalize the devastated U.S. uranium industry and
restructure the government's own failing program to sell enriched
fuel to nuclear power plants.
   The bill, which faces an uncertain future in the House, also
would establish a $1 billion fund to clean up or stablize large,
mildly radioactive piles of uranium tailings at 26 sites in seven
Western states. The cost would be shared equally by uranium mill
owners, nuclear utilities and the government.
   Among its more controversial provisions, the legislation _ which
took six years to clear the Senate _ would:
   _Impose a schedule of escalating fees on nuclear utilities that
load their reactors with more than 37.5 percent foreign uranium.
Beginning in 1995, however, utilities could buy up to half their
uranium from foreign suppliers without penalty. Opponents,
including Sens. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., and Daniel Evans, R-Wash.,
argued that this would violate the spirit of the recent free trade
pact signed with Canada, a leading exporter of relatively
inexpensive, high-grade ore. Bradley and Evans lost an attempt,
47-45, to delete the import restrictions from the bill.
   _Settle the nuclear industry's debt to the U.S. treasury for
past purchases of enriched uranium at $364 million. Opponents
argued that the figure should be as high as $8.8 billion.
   _Convert the Department of Energy's uranium enrichment program,
supposedly self-financing but a multibillion-dollar loser since the
mid-1970s, into a corporation owned by the government. If and when
the enterprise begins turning profits, the treasury could sell the
stock in a bid to recover previous investments.
   Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., who guided the measure through
his Energy Committee, said it is ``the culmination of six years of
legislative effort to fashion a sound, sensible and well-balanced
program to address the challenges we face today in the uranium
industry and the nuclear fuel cycle.
   ``We're not here to debate the Canadian trade deal,'' Johnston
said. ``Let's keep American jobs at home.''
   He estimated the bill would restore 20,000 jobs in the uranium
mining industry, which has dwindled in this decade to 2,000 workers
at just three mines. And he estimated the uranium enrichment
workforce, cut by half since 1980, could be restored to at least
12,000 jobs.
   The National Taxpayers Union, the Environmental Policy
Institute, the Union of Concerned Scientists, the U.S. Public
Interest Research Group and Environmental Action all opposed key
provisions of the bill, particularly the feature which limits the
government's recovery of uranium enrichment costs to $364 million.
   The groups argued that charging just $364 million is an
unprecedented bailout for the nuclear industry since the White
House has estimated that the industry should be billed $3 billion
and the General Accounting Office said the government should charge
$8.8 billion.
   The 1954 Atomic Energy Act required the government to be fully
compensated for its enrichment of nuclear fuel used by commercial
utilities.
   Enrichment is a critical process in nuclear power. It involves
increasing the percentage of fissionable material in natural
uranium from 0.7 percent to about 3 percent, the amount necessary
for use in light-water reactors.
   When the government began enriching commercial fuel in 1969, the
United States was the only free-world supplier of the service for
nuclear utilities and business was booming. Predictions of
burgeoning demand led to the expansion of the three DOE plants,
and, even then, all capacity was committeed.
   But then came a drastic decline in the demand for nuclear power,
with utilities canceling plans for more than 100 additional
reactors since the late 1970s. Meanwhile, two European consortiums
and the Soviet Union began to supply foreign utilities with
enriched uranium, and by the 1980s, the U.S. monopoly had dropped
to 50 percent of the market. Even some U.S. utilities found it
cheaper to buy foreign uranium.
   Adding to the government enrichment program's woes was the fact
that the Energy Department contracted with the Tennessee Valley
Authority for billions of dollars worth of electricity to operate
its production plants. But when demand fell off, that electricty
wasn't used _ even though TVA charged for it anyway. The Senate
legislation settles that long-term debt at $1.2 billion.

   Benjamin Netanyahu, who gained prominence as an
articulate defender of Israel's policies in his post as ambassador
to the United Nations, announced his resignation Wednesday.
   Netanyahu became Israel's permanent representative to the United
Nations in September 1984 after serving two years as the deputy
chief of mission at the Israeli Embassy in Washington.
   He is known for his forceful views on terrorism and is the
editor of a 1986 book called ``Terrorism: How the West Can Win.''
   Netanyahu, 39, plans to compete for a seat in the Parliament,
running as a candidate of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
right-wing Likud Bloc, Israel Radio said.
   ``I have accelerated my resignation because, as I think, we are
facing fateful decisions,'' Netanyahu said on Israel Television.
``I think we must ... create a policy based on the correct reading
of the international map.''
   ``As an ambassador, I could not voice my thoughts. I certainly
plan to do so and to influence the policy,'' he said.
   He said that ``Israel has to maintain a full military control
over all the territory west of the Jordan River'' and reject the
U.S. peace proposal, which he called a ``dangerous plan.''
   Israel has faced nearly four months of unrest in the occupied
West Bank of the Jordan River and the Gaza Strip, which it seized
in 1967.
   Netanyahu, the son of a Cornell University professor, has lived
in the United States most of his life. He attended high school in
Philadelphia and studied business administration at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   His education was interrupted when he returned to Israel in 1967
for a five-year stint in the army, during which he reached the rank
of captain.
   Netanyahu's brother Jonathan was killed during Israel's 1976
rescue of hostages in Entebbe, Uganda.

<HEAD>Dukakis Stresses His Experience Compared to Jackson</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential contender Michael Dukakis,
seeking a way to open a lead over Jesse Jackson, began Wednesday to
show how he might deal with his charismatic rival _ by stressing
his government experience.
   Dukakis sought to sidestep any direct criticism of Jackson,
whose campaign has boosted the Democratic Party with many new
voters who will be needed in the November election. But he
indirectly raised the issue of qualifications.
   ``I think (voters) want to know which one of us has the strength
and the experience and the values to lead this country, to build a
strong future. ... That's what this race is all about, that's what
the presidency is all about,'' Dukakis said at a Statehouse news
conference.
   Jackson's victories on Super Tuesday and in Michigan have made
him Dukakis' principal challenger, and Dukakis has been struggling
to find an effective way to fight off Jackson without alienating
Jackson's backers.
   Dukakis was drawing fire from another Democratic contender, Sen.
Albert Gore Jr., who accused him Wednesday of being overly
reluctant to specifically spell out his differences with Jackson.
   ``He was asked: Why would you make a better president?'' Gore
said of Dukakis. ``He said, `I'm not going to answer that question.
I think that's ludicrous.''
   However, Dukakis has been using the experience theme to separate
himself from Jackson, who has never held elective office.
   ``I'm a doer. I just don't talk about these things. I've created
jobs. I'm building housing for families of low and moderate
income,'' Dukakis told an interviewer on the CBS ``This Morning''
show.
   But at his Boston news conference, Dukakis was at pains to say
he considers himself on friendly terms with Jackson.
   ``We get along. We enjoy each other's company. He knows about
the things we're doing here. We know about the things he's doing,''
the governor said.
   Pressed, however, Dukakis mentioned two broad areas in which he
and Jackson differ.
   ``We don't agree on Middle East policy. We don't agree on some
aspects of economic policy here in the United States,'' Dukakis
said.
   He refused to go into detail, promising to do so in a speech in
Wisconsin later this week.
   Dukakis said he spoke to Jackson by telephone Wednesday morning,
just hours after taking a 2-to-1 victory over Jackson in the
Connecticut primary. However, the Massachusetts governor refused to
say what the two men discussed.

<HEAD>House Panel Urges FAA To Block Eastern Airlines Strike Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House committee urged the Federal Aviation
Administration on Wednesday to block a plan by Eastern Airlines for
a cargo carrier to fly Eastern passenger flights in the event of a
strike.
   In a report, the House Government Operations Committee said
Orion Air Inc. of Raleigh, N.C., should not be allowed to fly
Eastern aircraft until Orion corrects ``major deficiencies'' noted
in an April 1987 FAA report.
   ``The committee is of the view that prudence and common sense
dictate that Orion not be graduated to the ranks of a passenger
carrier pending a full and complete resolution of the major
problems cited in that report,'' the panel said.
   Orion officials have said they have corrected most of the
problems cited by the FAA.
   The committee also recommended that the government require
Eastern to notify passengers if their flights are to be operated by
Orion personnel.
   Earlier this year, Eastern signed an agreement under which Orion
would hire and train up to 400 pilots to fly Eastern aircraft if
the airline's pilots honor a possible walkout by the carrier's
mechanics.
   The pilots' union has challenged that arrangement in court. On
Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker issued a
preliminary injunction blocking Eastern from proceeding with its
Orion plan.

<DATELINE>MUSKEGON, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction crews scrambled Wednesday to
repair a cracked sewer main as million of gallons of raw sewage
flooded nearby bodies of water, endangering fish and forcing
industries to close.
   Health advisories warning residents against fishing in local
waterways remained in effect, as did three plant shutdowns ordered
Monday in hopes of curbing further environmental damage from toxic
chemical discharges.
   A 20-foot section of the 11-mile sewer main _ the only link
between Muskegon and the county wastewater management system _ had
to be replaced after construction crews discovered two small cracks
in the section Monday.
   But before the section could be replaced, the entire main had to
be drained, releasing about 10 million gallons of untreated sewage
into Sanford's Bayou.
   From 30 million to 40 million gallons of raw sewage was expected
to be released into local waterways before completion of the
repairs, expected Thursday, said Michael VandenHeuvel, chief
sanitarian for the Muskegon County Health Department.
   Ron Woods, environmental engineer for the state Department of
Natural Resources, said preliminary tests showed there definitely
would be a fish kill in Sanford's Bayou, but that none was expected
in Muskegon Lake or Muskegon River.
   ``We're optimistic that the lake will be able to assimilate the
waste,'' said Woods, who added that the sewage leak ``is among the
worst I've ever seen.''
   VandenHeuvel said the released sewage posed only a slight health
risk to humans.
   ``Just as a precaution, we don't want people drinking that water
or fishing in it,'' he said. He predicted the health warning would
be lifted in about a week.
   VandenHeuvel said a small leak had been detected in the pipe in
January and that repairs had been scheduled next month. Though the
cracks required quick action, he said, drainage of the main would
have been necessary in either case.
   ``There's just no way to shut that big pipeline down without
draining it,'' he said.
   To drain the pipeline, construction crews Tuesday cracked open
the broken section of the main with a power shovel, resulting in a
30-foot geyser of raw sewage and industrial waste, which flowed
into the bayou and eventually into Muskegon Lake.
   The wastewater vaporized, and the resulting steam cloud was
carried over the Jackson Hill neighborhood by a moderate wind. The
county health department reported several complaints of the stench,
but said it posed no health risk to residents.
   Officials urged residents to reduce the number of times they
wash clothes, take showers or flush toilets while repairs were
being done.
   Five hundred employees were laid off temporarily at one of the
three large Muskegon plants ordered closed Monday night to prevent
the discharge of toxic chemical wastes.
   At the S.D. Warren Co. paper mill in Muskegon, the treatment
system's largest single source of wastewater, nearly half the
company's 1,060 employees were told to report to work only after
the main was repaired, company officials said.
   At Sealed Power Corp.'s piston ring division, about 50 employees
were laid off Monday night, but were recalled Wednesday. Company
officials said the plant would begin limited operations again
Wednesday night, hauling wastes by trucks directly to the
wastewater management system.
   Lomac Inc., a chemical manufacturer in Egelston Township, has
maintained full employment levels.

<HEAD>AFL-CIO Gives Teamsters Sole Organizing Rights At Coors Brewery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The AFL-CIO on Wednesday awarded its
once-bitter rival, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, sole
oranizing rights to attempt unionizing the Adolph Coors Co.'s lead
brewery at Golden, Colo.
   The labor federation ordered one of its veteran affiliates, the
Machinists Union, to halt efforts to organize the same 3,200 Coors
workers, saying the Teamsters had a much better chance of
succeeding.
   The decision was an outgrowth of the Teamsters' decision last
October to reaffiliate their 1.6 million members with the AFL-CIO.
The union had been expelled 30 years earlier on charges of
corruption.
   Last September, before the Teamsters reaffiliation, the labor
federation had awarded sole organizing rights to the Machinists
Union at Coors. But the Teamsters challenged that ruling as soon as
they were readmitted.
   Facing ongoing organizing efforts by the Teamsters over the past
two years, Coors and the AFL-CIO last August ended one of the most
prolonged and heated labor-management disputes in the country.
   In that agreement, the labor federation brought to an end its
10-year-old nationwide boycott of Coors beer. In exchange the
company agreed to forgo erecting legal roadblocks often used by
management against an attempt by an AFL-CIO-affiliated union to
organize its workforce.
   But that was before the Teamsters were again an AFL-CIO
affiliate. And Teamsters officials admitted they had concerns now
about how the Coors-AFL-CIO pact will hold up in the face of the
federation's decision Wednesday.
   ``We're elated,'' said Charles Klare, director of the Teamsters'
100,000-member brewery and soft drinks division. ``But there's a
lot to be found out yet. We've got to meet with Coors and determine
if they accept the fact that the AFL-CIO picked us.''
   The Machinists Union had argued before Murray Finley, a former
president of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union who
was picked by AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland to arbitrate the
dispute, that the Teamsters should give up the Coors effort based
on last September's decision.
   The Teamsters countered they had an ongoing organizing campaign
at Coors a year before the Machinists entered the picture and had
gotten more than 30 percent of the workers at Golden to sign
Teamster union cards.
   Kirkland agreed with the Teamsters, according to witnesses at
the arbitration proceedings.
   ``It was a black-and-white case, based on the facts,'' said
Vicki Saporta, the Teamsters' director of organizing. ``We were
there first and they didn't even have a single card signed. We're
also the predominant union in the industry. We have contracts at
all 12 Anheuser-Busch breweries covering some 9,000 workers.''

   A special prosecutor was appointed
Wednesday to investigate the death of Julian Pierce, an Indian
activist running for a judgeship who was eulogized as Robeson
County's ``best hope for change.''
   The appointment by the state attorney general's office was made
at the request of county District Attorney Joe Freeman Britt, who
had been Pierce's opposition in the race for the Superior Court
judgeship.
   Pierce, who was found dead Saturday, has been mourned by
supporters who at first said they suspected he was killed because
someone did not want a Lumbee Indian to be elected judge. More than
2,300 people attended a funeral and a memorial service for the
activist Wednesday.
   Sheriff Hubert Stone said Pierce's slaying was apparently the
result of a broken romance, not a political vendetta, but that he
was still investigating comments made by Sandy Gordon Chavis.
Chavis had has been charged with murder in the incident; another
man involved in the shooting committed suicide Tuesday, officials
said.
   Senior Deputy Attorney General Jim Coman, a member of the
attorney general's special prosecution unit, was appointed special
prosecutor in the case, said John Simmons, a spokesman for Attorney
General Lacy Thornburg.
   Coman said he hoped to begin meeting with investigators next
week.
   Earlier, Rep. Harles Rose, D-N.C., whose district include
Robeson County, said he has asked for a congressional criminal
justice subcommittee, headed by Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., to hold
a hearing in the county.
   ``The only role a subcommittee would have would be to look at
how the federal government is interfacing down here,'' Rose said.
``I want to know, is this county getting the kind of federal help
it needs?''
   About 1,500 people attended a memorial service at Pembroke State
University and 800 mourners later jammed a small church in Maxton
for Pierce's funeral.
   ``He was loved. He was respected,'' said the Rev. Johnnie Chavis
during services at the Sycamore Hill Independent Holiness Church.
``That says a lot more than we can say about a lot of people.'' The
minister said he was a distant relative of the man who was arrested.
   Pierce's family filled up half of the seats in the 400-seat
church. Several hundred others sat on wooden chairs outside.
   At the Pembroke memorial service, Christine Griffin, acting
co-director of Lumbee River Legal Services, said Pierce's
compassion was ``overwhelming and all-consuming.''
   ``He was the best hope we had,'' Mrs. Griffin told the packed
auditorium. ``If he were here, he would say to us not to use the
same weapons that were used against him to bring about change.''
   ``We will keep up the peaceful fight for change through the
courts and through the ballot box,'' said the Rev. Joy Johnson.
   ``He was our first real hero for meaningful change in Robeson
County,'' said Johnson. Pierce had been the legal services
executive director until he resigned to run for judge.
   Despite the arrest of Sandy Gordon Chavis, Indian leaders said
racial tension would not go away.
   ``There's a tremendous amount of suspicion ... that perhaps all
the answers have not been put forward,'' Vernon Bellecourt, a
representative of the American Indian Movement, said Wednesday.
   Chavis said that John Anderson Goins, also 24 and a Lumbee
Indian from Pembroke, shot and killed Pierce, Stone said. Goins
committed suicide Tuesday.
   Stone said the killing appeared to stem from Goins' personal
problems with 16-year-old Shannon Bullard, the daughter of Pierce's
girlfriend, Ruth Locklear. The sheriff said Goins may have felt
Pierce helped Ms. Locklear get trespass warrants against him.
   Although he hasn't entered a formal plea, Chavis has told a
family friend he was not involved in the slaying, the News and
Observer of Raleigh said. The newspaper said Chavis told Ruth
Godwin that Goins asked him Saturday to go for a ride.
   The two stopped near Pierce's home, but Chavis said he thought
Goins was getting out of the car to go to the bathroom, the
newspaper reported.
   ``I heard three shots,'' Chavis said, according to Mrs. Godwin.
``I was stunned.''
   Stone declined comment on whether Chavis knew Goins' intentions.
   Goins left flowers, a teddy bear and some cards on the doorstep
of his former girlfriend's home before he killed himself, officials
said.
   Chavis' father, Ronald, helped bring the suit that prompted the
General Assembly to create a separate Superior Court district for
Robeson County.
   The law was intended to help a non-white candidate get elected
in a county where blacks and Indians make up 58 percent of the
registered voters.
   Under state law, Britt, who is white, will become judge because
he is now unopposed. Gov. Jim Martin said he would meet Thursday
with Indian leaders calling for a special Legislative session to
allow an opponent in the May 3 vote.
   The sheriff expressed regret at his comment Tuesday that the
slaying was ``just another murder.'' ``One person's life is just as
important as another's,'' Stone said.
   In Lumberton, a bomb threat emptied the Robeson County
courthouse on Wednesday, but employees were allowed to return in
less than two hours. No bomb was found and officials said they did
not know if the threat was connected to the Pierce case.

<HEAD>Court Considers Challenge to School Busing Fees</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Fixes spelling of Kdrmas thruout.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a case of particular
importance to rural areas, was urged Wednesday to compel states to
provide free bus transportation for poor school children.
   Duane Houdek, representing a family challenging busing fees in
North Dakota, said the state unlawfully discriminates against some
people who have trouble affording the busing charges.
   The Bismarck, N.D., lawyer was asked by Justice Byron R. White
whether North Dakota is constitutionally required to provide
transportation for poor people.
   ``That's a fair characterization'' of his argument, Houdek
replied.
   But some justices indicated their decision, expected to be
announced by July, could be based on narrower grounds. They said
the question may be whether North Dakota discriminates improperly
because it treats some school districts differently than others.
   North Dakota law provides free bus transportation to those
living in districts that have reorganized to broaden their tax base
and improve education. Only those districts that have not
reorganized are allowed to charge parents for busing costs.
   The law was intended to spur reorganization while assuring
people in those districts they would not have to pay for
transportation.
   Attorney General Nicholas Spaeth of North Dakota defended the
system as ``permissible geographic discrimination'' that does not
unfairly harm the poor.
   ``It's one way economic benefits are dispensed,'' he said. He
argued that the law does not deprive anyone of a public school
education.
   The law was challenged by Paula Kdrmas from rural Dickinson,
N.D. She said the statute denied equal educational rights to her
daughter, Sarita, because the family could not afford a $97 annual
bus fee.
   Ms. Kdrmas has driven Sarita the 16 miles to school rather than
pay the fee.
   George T. Dynes, a lawyer representing the local school
district, said it would have been cheaper for the Kdrmas family to
pay the bus fee _ which he said would be about 1.7 cents per mile.
   Bus service in Dickinson is offered for a fee to elementary
school students who live more than three miles from school and to
high school students who live more than four miles away.
   The North Dakota Supreme Court upheld the law, saying local
school officials rationally may decide their limited resources are
needed for services other than transportation.
   ``A statutory scheme under which a school district offers to
provide student transportation at considerably less expense to the
parent than self-transportation would entail does not constitute a
deprivation which offends either federal or state equal protection
rights,'' the state court said.
   The case is Kdrmas vs. Dickinson Public Schools, 86-7113.

   The State Department on Wednesday defended
Israel's authority to maintain order on the West Bank and Gaza, but
said it should be exercised in a humane way.
   Spokesman Charles E. Redman supported assertions by Assistant
Secretary of State Richard Schifter that Israel ``not only has the
right but the obligation'' to restore order in the violence-beset
territories it has held since the 1967 Six-Day War.
   Schifter said at a congressional hearing Tuesday that Israel
also was obliged ``to use appropriate levels of force to accomplish
that end.''
   In nearly four months of protests and disorder, 121 Palestinian
Arabs and an Israeli soldier have died in clashes. Schifter, who is
in charge of the State Department's human rights office, also
testified the United States had protested Israeli ``brutalization''
of Palestinian prisoners and ``random beating of civilians.''
   Schifter sought to distinguish those actions from dealing with
violence and violent protests.
   Abdeen Jabara, president of the American-Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee, called Wednesday for Schifter's
dismissal because of his comments.
   ``Schifter is apparently more concerned about Israel's image
than he is about human rights,'' Jabara said.
   ``The State Department has consistently opposed the use of live
ammunition, bone-breaking beatings and tear gas in confined places
against stone-throwing demonstrators,'' he said. ``Schifter's
testimony ... yesterday contradicted this established policy.''
   But Redman supported the official, saying: ``What Ambassador
Schifter said is exactly the same thing that the Secretary (of
State George P. Shultz) and myself and every American authority has
always said.
   ``First, Israeli authorities have a duty to preserve order. That
kind of duty has to be carried out with a certain authority.
There's no doubt about it. But it also has to be carried out in as
humane a way as possible.''
   Redman said ``we have never hesitated, in the latter sense, to
express our concerns or criticism of particularly activity or
excessive use of force.''
   About 75 pro-Palestinian demonstrators protested peacefully
outside the Israeli embassy's gates for an hour Wednesday afternoon.
   Lofting flags of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the
demonstrators chanted: ``Palestine, yes! Israel, no! Victory,
victory, PLO,'' and ``No more beatings, no more crime! Israel out
of Palestine.''
   This was the first protest at the embassy since the Supreme
Court last week knocked down rules that had kept all demonstrations
_ peaceful and otherwise _ at least 500 feet away from foreign
embassies. Authorities still are allowed to keep potentially
violent protests away from embassies, but no violence or arrests
occurred.
   The Israeli embassy's press office refused to comment on the
demonstration or the new rules concerning such protests.
   Moshe Arad, Israel's ambassador, blamed the deaths in West Bank
protests Wednesday on the Palestine Liberation Organization, which
he said is inciting ``warfare.''
   ``We are faced with a situation in the West Bank, in Gaza, in
which elements are interested, especially the PLO, in inciting to
violence, promoting violence and making sure no dialogue is
possible,'' Arad said on PBS's MacNeil@Lehrer ``NewsHour.''
   Shultz, meanwhile, met with a group of Israeli and Arab
reporters and defended his proposal to hold Mideast negotiations
beginning May 1.
   Shultz will fly to Rome on Thursday and then to Israel on Sunday
night to begin five days of shuttling to Israeli and Arab capitals.
   He denied in the session with reporters he would invite leaders
of the countries to a United Nations peace conference.
   Arad, on PBS, said that although Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir had ``reservations'' about a Middle East peace initiative
proposed by Shultz, Israeli government is united in welcoming the
secretary's return to the region next week.
   ``You will find the Israeli government interested and keen to
pursue this dialogue,'' Arad said.
   Ibrahim Abu-Lughod, a member of the Palestine National Council,
urged Shultz to open talks with the PLO.
   During Shultz's trip to the region in late February and early
March the Palestinians declined to meet with Shultz but Lughod,
also interviewed on PBS, said that on Shultz's return visit
Palestinians may meet the secretary. The Palestine National Council
is the so-called legislative arm of the PLO.
   Redman, on another subject, expressed regret that Israel had
ordered the closing of the Arab-owned Palestine Press Service in
Jerusalem. He said the result would be to restrict reporters'
freedoms.
   Khalil Jahshan, president of the Council of Presidents of
National Arab-American Organizations, said, ``We find the
administration's mild criticism of Israel morally bankrupt.''
   In letters to Shultz and to President Reagan, Jahshan wrote,
``It is our conviction that the United States government is
contributing to the worsening situation in the Israeli-occupied
territories by failing to make it absolutely clear that it will not
tolerate the escalating oppression of Palestinians.''
   Jahshan, who requested a meeting with Reagan, called on the
United States ``to ensure that impartial observers be permitted
access to the territories to help ensure that innocent people are
not massacred.''

   The first stage of the $600,000 World
Cup Grand Prix chess competition opens in Brussels on Friday,
beginning a new and lucrative battle among the world's top chess
players.
   The top-ranked 25 players internationally will each compete in
four of the six World Cup tournaments during 1988-89. The overall
champion will get $100,000, in addition to winnings from the
individual tournaments.
   The card for the opening $104,000 tournament in Brussels is
headed by Soviet Anatoly Karpov, the former world champion;
Dutchman Jan Timman and Swiss veteran Viktor Korchnoi.
   World Champion Garri Kasparov, a favorite to win the overall
competition, will sit out the first tournament.
   The World Cup is organized by the Grandmasters Association,
established recently by some of the world's best players to counter
the influence of the World Chess Federation.
   After the World Championship, the World Cup Grand Prix provides
the biggest prizes for the international grandmasters.
   The World Cup is aimed at increasing the popularity of chess and
making it more accessible to the media, while providing more money
for top players. Organizers it will provide continuous competition,
unlike the World Championship, held every few years.
   The World Chess Federation said in a statement that the World
Cup competition was ``a great step in the promotion of chess.''
   Each of the six tournaments will involve either 16 or 18 of the
selected players. The three best tournament finishes of each player
will count for the final standings.
   Other stages of the competition will be held in Belfort, France;
Reykjavik, Iceland; Barcelona, Spain; Rotterdam, the Netherlands;
and Skelleftea, Sweden.
   The three-week Brussels tournament is dominated by six Soviets
while players from Hungary, the United States, Switzerland,
Yugoslavia, Cuba, Britain, Sweden, and the Netherlands are also
scheduled to take part.
   The World Cup players were selected on the basis of their
international ranking.
   The next World Championship tournament is scheduled in 1990,
while the next two-year World Cup is set for 1990-1991.

<HEAD>Save Essence of My Trade Plan, Gephardt Urges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Richard A. Gephardt, out of the
presidential race but still campaigning on the trade front, called
on lawmakers Wednesday to save the heart of his plan to fight
foreign barriers with import curbs.
   ``I think that we can come up with something that will be
positive,'' the Missouri congressman told a House-Senate conference
committee that is drafting a compromise version of rival 1,000-page
trade bills approved by both houses last year.
   Gephardt told reporters earlier that he would push for the
conference committee to adopt his plan as it was approved by the
House. The Senate takes a differing approach to unfair foreign
trade barriers.
   But Gephardt seemed to acknowledge that his plan was bound to be
modified by the conference committee in the long run, something
that lawmakers have been conceding for weeks.
   He said any final version should focus on key countries
employing unfair trade practices as part of a systematic trade
strategy. Wholesale negotiations should be shunned in favor of
working on major trade trouble spots, Gephardt said.
   Mandatory retaliation is needed when negotiations fail, he
noted, saying ``You have to have a stick in the closet.'' But he
added that flexibility is necessary in dealing with trading
partners and thus the president should have the power to waive
retaliation when necessary.
   The conference committee stopped short Wednesday of action on
any of the major issues remaining before it puts the finishing
touches on a compromise.
   ``I'm not going to kill myself to have that guy downtown say
he's going to veto everything,'' said Rep. Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill., chairman of a House-Senate conference committee on trade
legislation.
   It was the latest Democratic comment on a drumroll of warnings
from the Reagan administration that the bill could be inviting a
veto. The vice chairman, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said Tuesday
that he was tired of hearing veto threats.
   Rostenkowski said he still hoped to wrap up work by the close of
business on Thursday, when lawmakers leave on their spring break.
But it remained unclear that he could meet that deadline.
   ``We're what you call clearing away brush,'' said Rep. William
Frenzel, R-Minn. ``We're to the small sapplings now and we haven't
gotten to the part of the forest where the big redwoods are.''
   Besides the Gephardt amendment, lawmakers have not resolved what
the bill should do to overhaul existing law under which U.S.
industries endangered by surges in foreign competition can obtain
import restrictions from the government.
   Whether to ban Toshiba products because of that company's sale
of submarine silencing equipment to the Soviets remains undecided,
as do provisions involving Third World debt and requiring foreign
owners of U.S. property to disclose their identities and the extent
of their holdings.
   Bentsen is campaigning to hang onto a Senate provision to repeal
the windfall profits tax on oil companies, a move that is opposed
by Rostenkowski.
   New protests that the bill already has been diluted came from
lawmakers representing industrial areas where Japanese imports have
cut into jobs.
   ``I doubt that I can vote for it,'' Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., told
the conference committee. ``Because I don't want to be a part of
some great trade bill that has no teeth and doesn't do anything at
all for the industry of this country.''
   ``The House has given up an awful lot and the administration has
gotten a lot of what it wants and the Senate has also,'' Rep. Don
Pease, D-Ohio, said. ``The final product ought to be a legislative
product and not just a product of the administration and ratified
by us.''
   Rostenkowski and Bentsen repeated their goal of producing
legislation that President Reagan would be willing to sign.
   ``Or one that would embarrass him if he vetoes it,''
Rostenkowski said.
   In a speech in Richmond, Va. on Monday, Reagan threatened to
veto the legislation if it contained mandatory import curbs, forced
disclosure of foreign ownership or a measure requiring employers to
give notice of plant closings or large-scale layoffs.
   The plant-closings provision was adopted by a House-Senate panel
Tuesday night. Rostenkowski was asked Wednesday if he regarded it
as a permanent feature of the legislation.
   ``I see it as a big problem for getting the president's
signature,'' he replied.

   The House overwhelmingly approved on Wednesday
a $48 million package of humanitarian aid for the Contra rebels in
Nicaragua and for children injured in nearly seven years of civil
war.
   The aid bill, passed on a 345-70 vote, was portrayed as a
gesture of U.S. support for a temporary truce reached last week
between the rebels and the Sandinista government, and for
continuing talks aimed at achieving a long-term end to hostilities.
   ``The hope is that this will lead to political instead of
military processes now taking over'' in Nicaragua, said House
Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash.
   ``This war is over, whether some like it or not,'' said Rep.
Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said after the House
vote, ``We are pleased and look forward to the vote tomorrow in the
Senate.''
   Despite producing the first strong bipartisan vote on U.S.
policy toward Nicaragua in more than five years, lawmakers showed
more weariness than joy as they plodded through two hours of debate.
   ``It is not the magic key to facilitate a cease-fire in place or
fruitful negotiations and all the rest,'' said Minority Leader
Robert Michel, R-Ill., who said it has become clear Congress is no
longer inclined to grant the military aid he would prefer. ``But
for the moment it's the only thing we have to give.''
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, noting the years of previous
acrimony on the issue, called the broad support for the bill ``very
impressive'' and said it should ``provide encouragement to both
sides in Central America.''
   Some Democrats called the vote another victory for Wright on the
Central American issue, which he has dominated on the U.S. side
since a five-nation peace accord was signed in Guatemala last Aug.
7.
   ``The speaker has invested tremendous risk, and has been almost
totally successful in saying, `I'm going to stick my neck out for
peace down there,''' said Rep. Mike Lowry, D-Wash.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., promised speedy
consideration on the other side of the Capitol, and it appeared
likely that the matter could come to a vote on Thursday.
   Officials of the Nicaraguan Resistance, a Miami-based umbrella
group of the Contra rebels, said they were elated with the package.
   ``This is what we have been waiting for, for a long time _ a
broad bipartisan aid package for the resistance,'' said Alfredo
Cesar, a director of the resistance. He said it sends ``a strong
political message to Central America in general and to the world
that the United States is not abandoning the resistance fighters in
the mountains.''
   The legislation would renew aid to the rebels, whose last U.S.
support ran out Feb. 29, and keep them together as a fighting force
while they wait in cease-fire zones inside Nicaragua for a
long-term truce to be worked out with the Sandinista government.
   ``It sends a message to the Contras that they are not abandoned,
that we do care about them and want to keep them healthy and a
viable force,'' said Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., who participated
in negotiations to draft the compromise.
   ``And it lets the Sandinistas know that it's important to the
United States Congress that the talks that take place down there
take place with good faith, and that they move toward
democratization,'' Edwards added.
   The agreement, made possible by a 60-day cease-fire reached by
the two warring sides last week, broke a weeks-long deadlock in
Congress over whether to keep up the flow of U.S. aid. The House
had killed efforts to provide new supplies to the rebels on two
earlier occasions this year.
   In agreeing to the deal, Republicans accepted Wright's
assurances that he would give any future request from President
Reagan for military aid for the rebels ``fair and orderly''
consideration.
   The White House apparently dropped its past insistence on an
ironclad legal guarantee of an expedited vote, settling instead for
the pledge contained in a letter from Wright to the president and
to Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill.
   Wright's pledge says Reagan can ask Congress for additional
rebel aid if Nicaragua's leftist government violates the March 23
cease-fire or any later peace accord and if the Contras continue to
observe its terms. Wright would send Reagan's request to the
appropriate House committee, which would have 10 days to act and
return the measure to the full House for action.
   Wright said other than the 10-day limit on committee
consideration, the letter simply laid out the normal procedures of
the House and in that sense represented a relatively small
concession.
   The letter suggests, but does not require, that Reagan first get
advice on whether new military aid is warranted from a verification
commission established by the March 23 agreement to oversee the
cease-fire.
   The commission includes Nicaraguan Cardinal Miguel Obando y
Bravo, a government critic who is seen as partial to the rebels,
and Joao Baena Soares, secretary general of the Organization of
American States, who is aligned more with the leftist government.
   Under the bill, $16.2 million in ``humanitarian'' aid _ defined
as food, clothing, medical supplies and family support payments _
would be sent to the Contras at a rate of $2.7 million a month for
the next six months. It would be delivered by a neutral
organization instead of the CIA, which has delivered past aid when
hostilities were under way.
   Of that amount, $2.2 million is earmarked for a Miskito Indian
Contra group which already had reached its own peace accord with
the Sandinistas.
   The rebels would get another $1.5 million to buy communications
gear, deemed essential to keeping Contra troops in touch with their
commanders during the cease-fire period. That pushes the total
rebel aid to $17.7 million.
   An identical amount would go to create a new program of medical
and humanitarian help for children who have been injured or
suffered as a result of the civil war, which has claimed some
40,000 lives since 1981.
   In addition, the legislation provides $10 million to pay
expenses of the verification commission and $2.5 million to pay
administrative overhead for the State Department's Agency for
International Development, which would handle distribution of the
money.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supermarkets, pharmacies and small
shops opened for the first time in 10 days Wednesday as a
nationwide strike aimed at toppling Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
began to fall apart.
   Despite the defections, Alberto Boyd, president of the National
Council of Private Enterprise, said he and other strike leaders
were not ending their effort to get rid of Noriega.
   In Washington, the Reagan administration said it was considering
new sanctions to force out Noriega, but it appeared no action was
imminent.
   The reopening of the capital's Gago, Rey and Super 99
supermarkets signaled the first crack in a work stoppage that
closed an estimated 90 percent of the nation's business and
industry.
   Later, the city's leading pharmacies reopened, as did some small
clothing and other dry goods stores in the central business
district.
   Traffic, extremely light for days, began to build again on
Panama City's streets, with the usual jams of buses, taxis and
private autos developing at major intersections.
   Grocery stores were doing a brisk but not extraordinarily heavy
business. Customers were required to pay in cash and appeared to be
buying mostly essentials.
   The government said some of the nation's banks, closed since
March 3, would reopen Thursday, but only to process old checks.
   Even with a limited reopening of banks and some stores, there
appeared to be no hope of a quick infusion of cash that would
permit a return to normal commerce in the money-short nation.
   The cash crisis is due in part to U.S. economic sanctions
against Noriega, who is charged in the United States with drug
trafficking. As chief of the 15,000-member Defense Forces, Noriega
is the real power behind Panama's civilian government.
   Some U.S. companies, including Miami-based Eastern Airlines and
Harrison, N.Y.-based Texaco, Inc., this week paid the government $5
million owed for taxes, a diplomatic source who spoke on condition
of anonymity said Wednesday.
   Owners of the reopened grocery stores could not be reached for
comment, but Angelica Guinard, a leader of the opposition National
Civic Crusade leader, said they had been under strong government
pressure to reopen.
   She said the pressure included threats of confiscation of their
goods and personal threats against themselves and their families.
   However, an executive of the Gago supermarket chain, the city's
largest, said his company's stores opened ``because we have to pay
our employees, and if we didn't open, we wouldn't have anything to
do it with.''
   He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A woman leaving a Rey supermarket in one of Panama City's
middle-class neighborhoods said she had bought only essentials:
rice, milk, beans and soap.
   ``The kids don't understand,'' she said. ``They want to know why
we don't have the kinds of things we had before.'' But she said the
eldest, who turned 8 on Saturday, is catching on.
   ``He said, `Mommy, you can't throw a party for me because
Noriega won't leave,''' she said. She wouldn't give her name.
   Felix Navarro, a wholesale fruit and vegetable dealer who closed
down his own business in the strike, carefully studied prices on
five-pound bags of rice before choosing one.
   Pointing to the rice and a container of cooking oil, he said,
``I had $100 in cash at the beginning of the month, and after I buy
these, I'm broke.''
   Panama's chronic cash shortage worsened last month when Noriega
fired President Eric Arturo Delvalle, touching off a panic run on
the banks that eventually forced their closure.
   The United States aggravated the crisis by imposing a number of
economic sanctions, including the freezing of millions of dollars
in Panamanian government funds held by U.S. banks.
   The Reagan administration continues to recognize Delvalle, who
is in hiding, as Panama's president.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters in
Washington on Wednesday that ``other sanctions are being actively
considered'' to force Noriega's ouster.
   Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, R-N.Y., said Noriega's troops have
harassed and beaten Panama Canal employees. ``There is a continuing
pattern of escalation'' in Panamanian actions against the canal, he
said in an interview on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.'' He did
not elaborate.
   On Tuesday, Noriega condemned the presence of the U.S.
helicopter carrier Okinawa on the Pacific end of the Panama Canal.
It passed through the canal Tuesday on its way to its home port,
San Diego.
   The U.S. Defense Department said in Washington that the passage
was ``routine,'' but Noriega called it ``a threat and an
aggression.'' There was no immediate indication how long the vessel
would stay in the area.

<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public universities in Alabama are not
racially biased, despite the accusations of a U.S. Justice
Department lawsuit, a lawyer for the major state university said
Wednesday.
   ``We feel the same as we always have _ that we're not guilty of
segregating our schools,'' said Robert L. Potts, an attorney for
the University of Alabama System. ``When we get to the merits of
the case in court, I think we'll prove that.''
   The federal government suit was filed Tuesday in U.S. District
Court. It was first filed in 1983, but had to be refiled after an
appeals court ruled that the judge who heard the first case should
have disqualified himself because he had participated in landmark
civil rights cases as a private attorney.
   ``I would not agree that the case is starting from ground zero
again,'' said Nathaniel Douglas of the Justice Department's Civil
Rights Division in Washington, D.C.
   ``There have been efforts to resolve the case by negotiation,
and we are ready to continue to do that.''
   The refiled suit charges again that state education officials
have ``perpetuated a racial dual system in public higher
education.''
   The Justice Department said two predominantly black schools,
Alabama A&M in Huntsville and Alabama State in Montgomery, are
close to mainly white schools and were intended for black students
only, while whites attended the other institutions.
   Justice Department lawyers said evidence exists of intentions by
state authorities to maintain vestiges of a dual school system.
   Federal attorneys cited a 1975 planning document of the Alabama
Commission on Higher Education, one of the defendants, that said
``with Alabama State and Alabama A&M to meet the needs of the
state's Negro citizens and with the University of Alabama and
Auburn University as major state institutions, the state seemed
relatively well served.''
   The suit also names as defendants the state, Gov. Guy Hunt, and
several universities in the system. Spokesmen for both the governor
and for Auburn University said they had no comment for the present.
   The suit said the state continues to allocate far more money to
the major white schools than to the mainly black ones.
   State authorities contend the predominantly white and black
schools in Huntsville and Montgomery are the result of decades-old
patterns of preference by students.
   In 1985, U.S. District Judge U.W. Clemon ruled after a five-week
trial that Alabama maintains vestiges of a dual school system.
Before he could begin the remedy phase of the case, his ruling was
appealed.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta ruled last
year that Clemon, Alabama's first black federal judge, should have
stepped down because of the rights cases he handled when he was a
private attorney.

   A planned meeting between two Democratic
presidential rivals collapsed Wednesday, with Jesse Jackson saying
Albert Gore had launched an attack on him that was ``more personal
than principled.'' Gore called Jackson's charge ``ridiculous'' and
said he was merely holding his rival to the same standard as any
other candidate.
   The two traded charges a day after Gore unleashed a broad
assault on Jackson's record as without experience and said he was
dismayed by Jackson's associations and Middle East policies.
   In his latest remarks, Gore defended his earlier criticism and
said he had mentioned nothing that could be regarded as personal.
   ``There is no reason why anyone should think Jesse Jackson ought
to be treated differently from any other candidate in this race,''
Gore told reporters. ``That's not a personal attack, and I'm
surprised he would see it as a personal attack.''
   ``I think it's ridiculous,'' Gore said. ``He's a major contender
for the White House. Is he to be immune from any questioning of his
position on the issues or his approach to the campaign? It's
ridiculous.''
   Gore commented at a news conference upon arriving in Washington
from a campaign trip through New York and Wisconsin. Only moments
earlier, Jackson had passed through the same private air charter
terminal.
   The two had met on Monday and, according to both campaigns,
agreed to set aside time Wednesday afternoon at National Airport
for a meeting since their schedules coincided. But late Wednesday
the meeting was canceled, the Gore campaign saying it was Jackson's
move.
   Before departing on his own trip to Wisconsin, Jackson told
reporters the two were planning to meet.
   But Jackson said that as a result of ``his attacks, which were
more personal than principled, it's not necessary to meet at this
time.''
   Jackson said they would meet ``at some future time.''
   Gore was informed of Jackson's comments and responded,
questioning whether anyone believed he should ``bend over backwards
to not say anything that might possibly be interpreted as
critical'' of Jackson
   ``Is there supposed to be a separate standard?'' he asked. ``Is
there supposed to be some unwritten rule why Jesse Jackson cannot
be criticized, why his positions have to be just sancrosanct and
nobody can say anything about them for fear somebody will just
misinterpret what your saying? I have from the start of this
campaign treated him exactly the same as every other candidate in
this race.''
   ``I don't think he really wants to be treated differently, and
if he thinks about it he won't really see a criticism of his
positions as a personal attack.''
   Gore also took aim at Dukakis, the delegate leader who was
considered the frontrunner for the nomination, at least until his
massive loss to Jackson in Michigan last weekend.
   Gore faulted Dukakis for what he said was a refusal to even
contrast himself with Jackson when asked.
   ``He was asked: `Why would you make a better president?''' Gore
said of Dukakis. ``He said, `I'm not going to answer that
question.' I think that's ludicrous.''
   On Wednesday, however, Dukakis moved cautiously to contrast some
of his positions with those of Jackson. He mentioned the Middle
East and domestic policy as points of difference, but declined to
provide specifics.

   The chief Contra military field commander, who has
expressed reservations about the rebel truce with the Nicaraguan
Sandinistas, said Wednesday he supports the truce agreement and
will comply with it.
   Col. Enrique Bermudez, who has said he doesn't trust the
Sandinistas, told reporters his concerns about the truce do not
mean he opposes Contra leadership on the touchy issue.
   ``We understand there can be differences, but during
negotiations we have to have a single position,'' he said at a news
conference.
   As an indicator of that continuing mistrust, the Contras said
Wednesday they have filed a formal complaint with the Nicaraguan
government about the way the Sandinistas handled the weekend
release of 100 political prisoners, a release called for in the
truce agreement.
   Contra spokeswoman Marta Sacasa said the rebels gave the
Sandinistas a list Saturday of the 100 Contras they wanted
released, but only nine or 10 of those prisoners released were on
the rebel list.
   She said the Sandinistas had made a ``verbal agreement'' to use
the Contra suggestions but their response ``does not show enough
good faith or trust.''
   Bermudez's comments Wednesday came at the same time that Contra
directors are taking to the Miami airwaves to calm opposition and
fear in the Nicaraguan community that the Contra leadership gave up
too much.
   Fourteen Nicaraguan exile leaders held a news conference in
Miami on Monday to call for the Contra leadership's resignation.
   ``Sometimes it's very easy, sitting here in Miami, to say, `My
God, look what's been agreed to in Sapoa,' without remembering that
the fighting men, who are dying in the mountains of Nicaragua, have
been abandoned'' by Congress, said director Alfredo Cesar, one of
the leaders who helped negotiate the cease-fire. Sapoa is the
Nicaraguan border town where the truce talks were held last week.
   Congress has voted against continued military aid for the
Contras, though the House on Wednesday approved a package of
humanitarian aid.
   Speaking on radio station WAQI-AM, Cesar denied the truce was
tantamount to surrender.
   But he said an armed guerrilla movement has been allowed to stay
in place, while its leaders travel to the capital to discuss the
nation's future.
   ``There is no precedent for this _ not even in Guatemala, a
democratic country, which requires that the communist guerrillas
put down their arms before discussing the country's future,'' Cesar
said Tuesday.

<HEAD>Chinese Students Publish Open Letter Criticizing Policy Change</HEAD>

   A group of Chinese students studying in America
published an open letter this week, urging their government in
Beijing to abandon a new policy that will slash the number of
China's students abroad.
   The letter, which began appearing in Chinese-language newspapers
on Tuesday and Wednesday, said the policy would be detrimental to
China's drive to develop its economy.
   It also said the policy would force many Chinese students in
America to return home before obtaining their degrees.
   An American China expert linked the policy change to concerns in
Beijing that Chinese students studying in the United States are
becoming too Westernized.
   The letter echoed an earlier petition, signed by 1,000 Chinese
students and sent to Beijing in January 1987. That letter opposed
conservative political policies in China.
   ``We are only asking that the right to study and complete our
degrees be restored to us,'' said Pei Minxin, a 30-year-old
doctoral candidate at Harvard University. Pei was one of 21 Chinese
``coordinators'' who included their telephone numbers in the
letter, inviting students who supported their position to call in
and add their name to the list.
   So far, he said, more than 800 Chinese students nationwide had
contacted the coordinators and pledged to sign the new letter,
which will be sent to Beijing soon.
   ``We are not planning to use this movement as an excuse to stay
here permanently,'' said Pei, whose request last week to extend his
passport was denied by Chinese authorities. ``We just want to
finish our degrees and go back to China.''
   Currently, about 40,000 Chinese students are studying outside of
China, 27,000 of them in the United States.
   Under the new education policy, China will send only 3,000
students abroad this year, the overseas edition of the People's
Daily reported Feb. 15.
   Student sources in New York said Chinese officials told them
only 20 percent, or 600, would be sent to the United States. Last
year, 8,000 Chinese students came to America.
   The policy also calls for strict limits on how long Chinese
students can stay abroad, according to a copy of an official
document obtained from Chinese sources in New York.
   The document says students seeking a master's degree must
complete it within one or two years, and students working for a
doctorate have only five years to finish it.
   That rule could be particularly onerous for many Chinese, who
come to the United States needing time to improve their English.
   Zheng Wanzhen, press councilor for the Chinese Embassy in
Washington, acknowledged that fewer students would be sent abroad
but denied there was a policy change.
   ``It's just that they have been sending too many students to
America,'' he said. China will send students to other countries
like the Soviet Union, East Germany, Japan and Western Europe, he
said.
   Merle Goldman, a professor of history at Boston University, said
the policy change marked a shift away from the liberal slant of
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who opened the country to the West in
the 1970s.
   ``Not many students are returning to China and the Chinese want
them back,'' she said.The Feb. 15 People's Daily said of the 36,000
Chinese who have come to America, only 8,817 have returned.
   In addition, Ms. Goldman said, when they do come home ``they are
already infected by the political values of the United States. They
absorb Western political ideas and that could be troublesome for
the Chinese state.''
   Ms. Goldman said Premier Li Peng was responsible for the shift,
which began last year when he took over as acting premier.

   Arab leaders and the PLO bitterly
condemned Israel's crackdown in the occupied territories and called
Wednesday for an international peace conference to create an
independent Palestinian state.
   In an emergency Security Council meeting, Israel rejected a
conference and asked instead for direct negotiations with its
neighbors.
   U.S. Ambassador Herbert S. Okun accused the Arabs of ``extreme
rhetoric'' and said Secretary of State George P. Shultz will seek a
forum in his forthcoming Middle East mission that would permit
direct negotiations leading to a comprehensive settlement.
   The 15-member council heard 10 speakers denounce Israel's
occupation of lands captured from the Arabs and call for a
U.N-sponsored peace conference involving all parties to the
conflict, including Israel, the PLO and the five permanent members
of the council.
   They denounced Israel's sealing off the West Bank and Gaza, its
imposition of a curfew and banning of journalists. Saudi Arabian
and Libyan envoys compared Israel's treatment of Palestinians to
Nazi persecution of Jews.
   The council adjourned without a resolution or a vote but agreed
to meet again to consider the situation in the occupied
territories. Since the Palestinian protests began in December, the
council has condemned Israeli practices as violating Palestinian
human rights.
   Farouk Khaddoumi, the top envoy of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, told the council, ``Peace can only be established
through an end to Israeli occupation and security can only reign if
an independent Palestinian state is established.''
   Khaddoumi is director of the PLO Political Department, its
equivalent to foreign minister. He accused the United States of
supporting repression in the occupied territories and said
Washington encouraged Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel, whom
he called ``a terrorist.''
   The United States, he said, is using its veto power to prevent
the Security Council from adopting measures that would prevent
Israeli ``crimes'' against Palestinians.
   He said the Palestinian people would never accept Israel's
proposal of autonomy as a substitute for sovereignty.
   The United Nations recognizes the PLO as the only legitimate
representative of the Palestinian people.
   Israel considers the PLO a terrorist organization.
   Israeli Ambassador Johanan Bein, the deputy permanent
representative, condemned recent PLO broadcasts which he said
exhorted Palestinians to throw rocks and attack Israeli security
forces with knives.
   ``The PLO solution is dissolution of Israel,'' Bein said. ``This
will not be the case. The PLO has shown it will continue to fight
to the last Palestinian child, but this will never constitute a
basis for peace, but only for violence.''
   He said Israel regrets the loss of life of Arab or Jew, ``But
when confronted by unbridled mob violence, with stones, iron bars,
fire bombs and even live ammunition, it has no alternative but to
attempt to quell the violence and restore order.''
   Foreign Minister Ahmed Taleb Ibrahimi of Algeria told the
council ``it is high time for resolute action'' by the world
community and asked for a U.N.-sponsored Middle East peace
conference to set up a Palestinian state.
   ``There will only be peace,'' Ibrahimi said, ``if there is total
and unconditional evacuation of Israel from all Arab territories.''
   Ibrahimi is the leader of a high-level Arab delegation visiting
New York.
   More than 120 Palestinians and one Israeli soldiers have been
killed since riots began Dec. 8 in the West Bank and Gaza, which
Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East War.
   Speakers on the Wednesday agenda included Ibrahim Massoud,
minister of state for foreign affairs of Saudi Arabia; Foreign
Minister Farouk Al-Shara of Syria, and Chedli Klibi, the Arab
League secretary-general.
   Diplomats said earlier that a resolution and vote were unlikely,
because resolutions critical of Israel often are vetoed by the
United States.

<HEAD>Two White Police Convicted of Murdering Two Blacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two white police officers were
convicted of murder Wednesday in the killings of two black men said
to be drug dealers.
   The Rand Supreme Court convicted both Sgt. Robert van der Merwe,
30, and Capt. Jack La Grange, 40, on two counts of murder and one
count of intent to murder after a three-week trial.
   Van der Merwe testified he shot the men because La Grange duped
him into believing they were linked to the African National
Congress guerrilla movement.
   ``I believed that what I was doing was in the national interest
and it would never have occurred to me to question an order from an
officer,'' he said.
   The blacks, who were alleged drug dealers, were killed in
separate attacks last September and October.
   Van der Merwe testified he knew of ``clandestine operations'' in
which security police carried out missions to kill suspected ANC
operatives.
   ``I realize that such actions are illegal in terms of the law,
but I deem them lawful in terms of head office orders,'' he said.
   Both van der Merwe and La Grange had pleaded innocent. They
could face the death penalty, although there was no immediate word
on sentencing.
   The ANC is the main guerrilla group fighting apartheid, the
system of racial segregation in which the 26 million blacks have no
vote in national affairs and the 5 million whites control the
economy and maintain separate districts and services.
   In other developments Wednesday:
   _Police arrested 106 men and women demonstrating Tuesday against
a labor bill which would restrict union rights, according to Frank
Meintjies, spokesman for the Congress of South African Trade
Unions, the nation's largest labor federation.
   Police said in their daily unrest report for the preceding 24
hours that they arrested 124 people in industrial areas for
gathering illegally and refusing to disperse. They gave no details,
except to say they used batons and dogs to disperse one group.
   _Authorities also reported that an unknown gunman wounded a
28-year-old municipal policeman in the chest in Soweto, the black
township outside Johannesburg.
   _Police said they used batons to disperse people gathered
outside a court building in the mixed-race township of Wynberg in
Cape Town, but reported no injuries or arrests. No reason for the
gathering was given.
   The Star newspaper reported that the police charged a crowd of
friends and relatives of 11 people on trial on treason charges in
Wynberg courthouse. Magistrate A.S. McCarthy ordered the courtroom
cleared after defendants and court spectators joined in singing a
Zulu anthem, ``God Bless Africa.''
   _In Pretoria, police cordoned off streets around the Union
Buildings, where the government has its offices, and declared it an
emergency area when 70 students from eight universities gathered to
present petitions to President P.W. Botha's office.
   The petitions protested last month's banning of 17
anti-apartheid organizations and recent government restrictions on
protest activity on campuses.
   _In Grahamstown, in eastern Cape province, four black residents
of Uitenahage township were sentenced to death Wednesday for the
murder of a youth activist they allegedly believed had become a
police informer. The sentences brought to 50 the number of people
on death row for offenses connected with the three years of
nationwide unrest from 1984-1987.

   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd on
Wednesday called Attorney General Edwin Meese III ``the crown jewel
of ... sleaze'' and urged him to quit, but Meese said ``there's no
reason to resign'' and President Reagan reiterated his support for
his old friend.
   Meese, the focus of an 11-month criminal investigation that has
sapped Justice Department morale, also predicted that Solicitor
General Charles Fried would not follow the path of two other
officials who shook the department on Tuesday by turning in their
resignations.
   ``Business is operating as usual at the Justice Department,''
Meese told reporters. He said replacements were being sought for
the two aides who resigned, that ``the management team is very
strong and everything is going along well.''
   Asked by reporters whether he would quit, Meese responded: ``No,
not at all. There's no reason to.''
   A Republican, Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon, joined other members
of the Senate in calling for Meese to step down.
   Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns and Assistant Attorney
General William Weld, who oversaw all federal criminal
investigations, resigned because they were concerned that Meese's
continuing legal difficulties were damaging the effectiveness and
credibility of the Justice Department, said department sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   At a meeting Wednesday in Meese's Justice Department office,
Fried, who ranks fourth in the Justice Department hierarchy,
refused to give an immediate answer when Meese personally urged him
not to join Burns and Weld, the sources said.
   Fried told the attorney general he would consider what to do in
the next few days, the sources said.
   Asked about the meeting with Fried, Meese said, ``I don't talk
about my conversations with my top management people, but I have no
doubt that Mr. Fried will remain a strong member of the management
team.''
   Meese called at the White House late Wednesday and met for 15
minutes with chief of staff Howard Baker, but spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said their discussion was about judicial appointments.
   Fitzwater said Meese did not meet with Reagan and the two had
not discussed the matter of the resignations, but he added, ``I'm
sure the president will discuss it with him at some point.''
   He did not say when. Meese is expected to be at the White House
again on Thursday for a Cabinet meeting.
   There have been reports indicating Mrs. Reagan is among those
who want Meese to go. Fitzwater was asked why Meese remained on the
job when Baker, Vice President George Bush and Mrs. Reagan were
known to want him out.
   ``I don't think any of that is true,'' Fitzwater replied. Asked
if he was denying it, he said, ``I don't know. I've never heard it
said. I've never heard anybody say that.''
   Bush said Wednesday he was troubled by the resignation of top
Justice Department officials, but ``I'm not going to pass
judgment'' on whether Meese should resign. Mrs. Reagan has not
publicly expressed an opinion on the attorney general's status.
   On Tuesday, Fried, who argues the government's position in
Supreme Court cases, told The Associated Press the resignations had
prompted him to reassess his own future. He said he needed time to
think the matter through.
   Congressional reaction against Meese was strong the day after
the resignations of Burns, who is the No. 2 Justice Department
official, and Weld.
   ``Mr. Meese has become the crown jewel of the sleaze factor in
Reagan administration history,'' Byrd, D-W.Va., told reporters. He
said that if Reagan doesn't want to ask Meese to quit he should
find someone else to ask him.
   ``He ought to get out,'' said Byrd. ``The country cannot have
confidence in the Justice Department when the top law enforcement
officer obviously has to spend an inordinate amount of his time
defending himself. He should be spending his time fighting the war
on drugs, crime,'' Byrd said.
   But Reagan, almost in reply, told reporters during a ceremony
honoring young scientists in the White House Rose Garden, ``He's
been a friend for over 20 years. I have every confidence in him.
... I'm not going to comment any further.''
   Of Meese, Packwood said ``you finally reach a place where there
is a cloud of suspicion, a sufficient cloud of suspicion, that I
think you owe it to the president to remove yourself.''
   Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, a Republican member of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, declined to call for Meese's
resignation but said the attorney general owed the American people
``a full public explanation as to why his deputies have left.''
   ``There's no doubt in my mind that it is very harmful to the
Republican Party and could hurt our nominee in the fall,'' Specter
told reporters. ``But it is even more harmful to the country. I'm
concerned as an American.''
   Specter accused Byrd of trying to make the controversy over
Meese a partisan issue.
   ``When Senator Byrd starts to mix his metaphors and talk about
crown jewels and sleaze it's totally inappropriate,'' Specter said.
   The criminal investigation of Meese launched last May 11 by
independent counsel James McKay is continuing and so far has delved
into his involvement through longtime friend E. Robert Wallach with
scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. and a $1 billion Iraqi pipeline.
   McKay widened the probe this week by subpoenaing payroll records
and other documents of the Washington chapter of the Multiple
Sclerosis Society in connection with a $40,000-a-year job Meese's
wife, Ursula, got with the charity in 1985. Investigators are
examining Wallach's role in helping Mrs. Meese get the job.
   Fitzwater confirmed that Burns and Weld had met with Baker last
week.
   ``The gentlemen indicated they wanted to resign, or they were
disenchanted, and they were advised to talk to the attorney general
about that. That's the proper way to do it, the proper course of
action,'' Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman said Reagan ``has been briefed on the concerns and
complaints of Burns and Weld. He just wanted to be kept informed.''
   He said the two officials met with Baker on March 16 and then
again Tuesday morning before they resigned. ``Certainly the
president was briefed on that meeting,'' Fitzwater said.
   On Capitol Hill, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said Meese ``has
shown no willingness to resign, but he ought to at least step aside
because he can't run the Department of Justice. He's lost all
effectiveness.''
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz,. said he also is drafting a
letter to Meese calling on him to resign because of his ``lack of
credibility and confidence.''
   But Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, said Meese should remain in
office ``until the special prosecutor comes up with his
conclusions.''
   ``If he concludes there was impropriety that's another
question,'' Hatch said.
   Byrd, Leahy, DeConcini and Hatch all are members of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, which oversees operations of the Justice
Department.

<TEXT>
   Jessica McClure, whose rescue from a
Midland well attracted international attention, arrived Wednesday
to help raise funds for a boy with serious lung problems.
   Jessica, who turned 2 last Saturday, will participate in a
balloon release Thursday to benefit 5-year-old Brennan Bolin, said
benefit coordinator Bonnie Arnold.
   The families of the children are acquainted and that is how
Jessica got involved, according to Mrs. Arnold.
   Jessica and her mother, Cissy McClure, were flown to Lancaster
Municipal Airport on a private plane for a noon reception, said
Mrs. Arnold.
   Brennan has idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis, a rare condition
in which bleeding occurs within the lungs' lining.
   Mrs. Arnold, wife of Lancaster Mayor Walter D. Arnold III, said
the boy needs a heart-lung transplant at the University of
Minnesota.
   ``They're hoping that unless anything goes wrong, he will be
weaned from steroids for six weeks, as of June 1, and he will be
relocating to Minnesota to await a donor,'' she said.
   The surgery will cost $650,000 and all but $125,000 is covered
by insurance, she said.
   Lancaster residents had already donated $15,000 even before
Thursday's official start of the fund-raising campaign.
   Jessica will release the first balloon, followed by children
from Lancaster elementary schools, said Mrs. Arnold.
   ``These children will have each donated one dollar to Brennan's
cause. Their name and a special message will be in each balloon,''
said Mrs. Arnold. ``There will be a drawing among those children
for two toys signed by Jessica.''
   Mrs. Arnold says the boy's grandmother, Sue Ellen Nall, lives in
Midland, where Jessica fell into an abandoned water well last
October. It took 58 hours for rescuers to get the toddler out in a
dramatic, nationally televised climax to her ordeal.
   A task force to help the Lancaster boy was organized by First
United Methodist Church.

<TEXT>
   A bomb damaged a textile plant in
Cordoba early Wednesday and more than 20 telephoned bomb threats
were received in Buenos Aires, police reported.
   Bombs exploded in three Buenos Aires movie theaters Tuesday,
wounding four people, including a national policeman who lost a
hand and an eye.
   President Raul Alfonsin blamed ``terrorists'' trying to ``put an
end to democracy'' for the explosions.
   In addition to the blast at the Pompas Brothers plant in
Cordoba, an industrial city in central Argentina, and the three
theater explosions in the capital, 16 bombings have been carried
out or attempted since January. Most were in Buenos Aires.
   Telephoned threats were reported throughout the day Wednesday
but no bombs were found, officials said. Banks, hospitals,
municipal buildings and shopping arcades were evacuated because of
the calls.
   A group has left leaflets at most bombing sites carrying the
initials ``O.A.S.-M.R.P.'' The meaning of the initials is not known.
   Officials say the group is thought to be linked to former Lt.
Col. Aldo Rico, 44, who led two unsuccessful rebellions in army
units during the past year.
   Rico, however, issued a communique Wednesday night denying any
connection with the bombings.
   The uprisings he led were the most serious threats to Alfonsin
since his civilian government took office in December 1983, ending
nearly eight years of military rule.
   Rico's communique said the bombings were ``contrary to the
essence of `Operation Dignity,''' his effort to win pardons for
officers accused of human rights violations during the government's
1976-83 campaign against suspected leftist subversives.
   At least 9,000 people were abducted and vanished without a trace
during what became known as the ``dirty war'' under military rule
in Argentina, officials say.
   The former colonel is being held at the Magdalena military
prison 60 miles south of Buenos Aires.

<TEXT>
   Eighteen months before Tawana Brawley's alleged
abduction, a schoolmate told police a markedly similar story of
being kidnapped and sexually assaulted, according to broadcast and
published reports.
   In a story published Wednesday, sources told the Daily News that
the unidentified teen-ager reported to police in 1986 that she had
been abducted by men in a green car and taken to a wooded area and
attacked.
   The charges were investigated by the Poughkeepsie police, who
determined that they were unfounded and apparently fabricated to
cover up sexual abuse by a male relative, the News said.
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, an adviser to the Brawley family, angrily
denounced the News story, and he and one of the Brawleys'
attorneys, Alton Maddox, asserted that it had been leaked by state
Attorney General Robert Abrams, the special prosecutor in the case.
   ``It's ridiculous to take a story that no one has established
that Tawana had any knowledge of and imply that she was trying to
use it,'' Sharpton said.
   A spokesman for Abrams, Timothy Gilles, declined to comment on
the reports, but denied that Abrams' office had been the source of
the story.
   The case has received wide attention, in part because the family
has refused to cooperate with officials, accusing them of racial
bias in their handling of the investigation.
   Poughkeepsie radio station WKIP said a woman saying she was the
mother of a girl with a similar story called the station's nightly
talk show last week. The station rebroadcast parts of that
interview Wednesday.
   The caller, who declined to give her name, said during the
broadcast that Miss Brawley and her daughter had talked at a
shopping mall the night before Miss Brawley's disappearance last
November.
   The girl eventually recanted her story, the woman said.
   Miss Brawley, who was reported missing for several days in
November, has told her family she was abducted in a green or blue
car, taken to a wooded area and sexually abused by six white men.
One of the men flashed a police-like badge, she said.
   Four days later she was found near her family's former apartment
in Wappingers Falls, dazed, covered with animal excrement and with
racial epithets written on her body. Miss Brawley is black.

<HEAD>Report Libyan Attempt to Improve Relations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state-owned magazine says a ranking Libyan
visited Egypt in an attempt to mend relations between the North
African neighbors, which have been at odds for years and fought a
brief border war in 1977.
   In the edition appearing Thursday, the weekly Al-Mussawar said
Col. Abdel-Fattah Younis Farag came to Cairo after Egypt allowed
the return of four Libyan warplanes whose pilots landed on the
wrong side of the border March 1 because of bad weather and lack of
fuel.
   On Monday, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said he was withdrawing
his forces from the border and asked nothing in return. He said
Libya would not use force to get President Hosni Mubarak's
government to renounce the peace treaty Egypt signed with Israel in
1979.
   Mubarak reacted to that gesture Wednesday by warning Gadhafi not
to conceal terrorist plans behind expressions of good will.
   Al-Mussawar said Farag, commander of the border military zone,
came to thank Mubarak for returning the Soviet-built MiG-23s. The
magazine did not say if he met Mubarak, but said the colonel was
expected back in Cairo soon to ``continue talks with the Egyptian
leadership.''
   It said Farag was close to Gadhafi and visited Egypt several
times before, trying with little success to ``open a dialogue.''
   In his comments Wednesday, Mubarak questioned the motive for
Gadhafi's statement that he was opening the border.
   ``Might it be to smuggle in bombs?'' the president said at a
political meeting in Giza province. ``I strongly warn him. I know
all his tricks.''
   His comments, carried by the Middle East News Agency, apparently
referred to charges that Gadhafi arranged bombings in Cairo and
other cities in 1975-76.
   Egypt also has said it suspected Libya of laying mines in the
Gulf of Suez and Red Sea that damaged 20 ships in the summer of
1984.
   Mubarak said Gadhafi's statements ``have no impact on
relations.''
   Gadhafi recently freed and repatriated 36 Egyptian prisoners,
among them three soldiers whose return Mubarak had requested
publicly. Egypt sent home five members of the Libyan air force who
flew to Egypt last year in three separate incidents but who did not
request asylum.
   Libyan-Egyptian relations soured in 1972 when Egypt rejected
Gadhafi's proposal that the two countries merge. They got worse
when the late President Anwar Sadat made the American-mediated Camp
David agreements with Israel in 1978 that led to the peace treaty.

   A computer program that helps doctors figure out
which patients have suffered heart attacks could prevent about
175,000 intensive care admissions each year, saving an estimated
$85 million, its developers say.
   The program, produced by doctors at Brigham and Women's Hospital
in Boston, is intended to help emergency room physicians determine
whether patients with chest pain actually had heart attacks.
   In testing on 4,770 patients at six hospitals, they found that
the program could have reduced needless admissions to the coronary
care units by nearly 12 percent.
   They cautioned, however, that the program should help doctors,
not take their place, and ``should never override common sense.''
   A report on the project, directed by Dr. Lee Goldman, was
published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
   The program is the latest of a variety of efforts intended to
let doctors take advantage of computers when making complicated
decisions about patient care.
   The researchers entered about 50 variables involving patient
history, physical examination results and electrocardiogram
findings into the computer. The computer program than used these
variables to determine whether patients actually had suffered a
heart attack or not, according to the Journal.
   The computer and the doctors were equally adept that spotting
true heart attacks. Both missed 12 percent of them. However, the
computer was better at ruling out heart attacks among people who
had not suffered them.
   The researchers noted that sometimes the doctors were better
than the computer at evaluating patients.
   The doctors estimated that the program could help doctors avoid
about 175,000 admissions to intensive care units for heart patients
each year. They said that even if these patients were put in other
hospital wards, the program could help save at least $85 million
annually.

   Iranian gunboats struck at the Cypriot
supertanker Haven near the entrance to the Persian Gulf at dawn
Thursday and set it on fire, shipping executives reported.
   The executives said the raid near the Strait of Hormuz was
apparently in retaliation for an Iraqi attack Wednesday on a
different Cypriot supertanker under charter to Iran.
   They said the 109,700-ton Haven came under attack by the the
Iranians at dawn off the emirate of Ras al-Khaimah.
   Salvage tugboats rushed to aid the stricken tanker, but it was
not known immediately if the crew suffered casualties or what the
extent of damage was. The gulf-based executives, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, did not know the Haven's destination.
   Iran attacks neutral commercial vessels in the southern gulf
near the Strait of Hormuz on a ship-for-ship basis in the so-called
``tanker war,'' in which about 500 vessels have been hit by both
sides in the 7{-year-old Iran-Iraq war, with about 300 seamen
killed.
   In other developments in the Iran-Iraq war, Iranian rebels
operating from Iraq claimed to have killed 2,000 Iranian
Revolutionary Guards in a two-day battle in the oil-rich Khuzestan
region of southern Iran. A statement from the National Liberation
Army of Iran said its force of 15 brigades had returned to Iraq.
   Iraq said it fired three long-range missiles into Isfahan, a
city in central Iran, and its planes bombed Iranian towns. Tehran
radio said the missiles killed five people in Isfahan, wounded
several and destroyed houses and a mosque.
   Dispatches from Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency
said Iranian planes dropped 10 tons of bombs on Sulaymaniyah,
provincial capital of northern Iraq, and hit border towns with 14
short-range missiles. Iraq said civilians, including three
children, were killed in missile and shelling attacks.
   Also, the Kuwaiti government and shipping agents said three
Iranian speedboats fired from several hundred yards away Wednesday
at Bubiyan, a Kuwaiti island off Iraq, wounding two soldiers. Iran
denied it.
   Iraqi warplanes Wednesday raided the 259,447-ton Cypriot
supertanker Anax chartered by Iran and set it on fire 70 miles
south of Kharg, the executives reported earlier. It was the seventh
strike reported in 11 days on a tanker owned or leased by Iran.
   Iranian retaliatory strikes are mainly carried out by
speedboats, darting from the southern gulf island of Abu Musa. The
Iraqis usually attack by warplanes using radar-guided missiles in
the northern gulf near Iran's big Kharg Island oil terminal.
   The Anax, also hit Dec. 2, is part of a fleet that shuttles
Iranian oil from Kharg to makeshift terminals in safer waters 450
miles down the waterway.
   No injuries were reported on the Anax. A fire in the engine room
was said to be under control, but Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence
Unit in London described the ship as ``dead in the water.''
   In reporting the tanker raid Wednesday, Iraq said its jets
scored an ``accurate and effective hit'' on a ``large maritime
target.''
   Shipping agents, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Iranian speedboats sped away from Kuwait's Bubiyan island after
Wednesday's attack, which appeared to be for propaganda purposes
rather than to cause damage. The reports did not say what weapons
were fired, but Iranian speedboats normally carry machine guns and
grenade launchers.
   Bubiyan is about 20 miles from Iraq's Faw peninsula, part of
which Iran seized early in 1986.
   Iran considers Kuwait an ally of Iraq in the war that began in
September 1980.

   The scarcity of blacks in the news media
continues to hinder the nation's understanding of poverty in the
United States, the head of a 1968 presidential commission on race
relations said Wednesday.
   ``There is no way, I think, that the white community can be
informed regarding conditions in the black inner cities ... without
the use, employment and advancement of blacks and other minorities
as reporters, as editors and executives within the media,'' said
David Ginsburg, former executive director of the Kerner Commission
appointed by President Lyndon Johnson.
   Ginsburg and three other members of the commission took part in
a seminar on minorities in the news media sponsored by The
Commercial Appeal newspaper in Memphis.
   The former commission members said racial divisions and poverty
are as rampant in the United States today as when the Kerner report
was filed in 1968.
   ``We've actually begun to go backward,'' said former
commissioner Fred Harris, a political science professor at the
University of New Mexico and former U.S. senator.
   The Kerner Commission was appointed by Johnson following ghetto
riots that erupted across America in the 1960s.
   In its report, the commission chastised the news media for
failing to hire very many blacks or report fully on poverty in the
central cities.
   ``They have not communicated to the majority of their audience _
which is white _ a sense of the degradation, misery, and
hopelessness of living in the ghetto,'' the report said.
   Ginsburg, a Washington, D.C., attorney, said the news media are
poised to repeat that mistake because they have not been
sufficiently vigorous in hiring blacks and other minorities.
   ``The American Association of Newspaper Editors has got it on
their agenda, but they are not doing enough,'' he said.
   Ginsburg offered statistics during a break in the meeting which
said that minority hiring in the newsrooms of daily newspapers
nationwide was 6.3 percent last year, while the minority population
was about 25 percent, he said.
   Ginsburg said during a panel discussion that while some news
organizations have done well in hiring and promoting minorities,
blacks have generally found it easier to be elected to government
positions than to find jobs in the media.
   ``We're electing more blacks officials by far then we are
employing blacks and other minorities in the newsrooms. To say this
is unconscionable is almost an understatement,'' Ginsburg said.
   Former commission members Katherine G. Peden, president of an
industrial development company in Louisville, Ky.; and James C.
Corman, a Washington, D.C., lawyer, also participated in the
meeting.

<TEXT>
   British soldiers began
returning home Wednesday from the first major military exercise
held by Britain in the Falkland Islands since it freed them from
Argentine occupation in 1982.
   Argentina and other Latin American nations had fiercely
denounced the reinforcement exercise, calling it aggressive.
Britain denied the allegation.
   ``The whole exercise has been worthwhile,'' Maj. Gen. Neil
Carlier, commander of British forces on the remote South Atlantic
islands, said Wednesday.
   ``We have proven that we can reinforce with speed, and maintain
the integrity of the airfield.''
   The deployment of nearly 1,000 troops in an exercise codenamed
Fire Focus began March 7 and military officials said it ended with
no injuries and no accidents.
   The maneuvers involved bringing troops, planes and equipment
8,000 miles from Britain.
   On the island, 2,000 permanently stationed soldiers also took
part in the exercise.
   Britain freed the colony after a 74-day conflict which left 712
Argentines, 255 Britons and three Falkland Islands civilians dead.
   Argentina, which is 325 miles west of the islands, claims the
Falklands are an inheritance from the days of Spanish colonial rule
and were stolen by Britain, which has ruled them as a colony since
1833.

<HEAD>Woman Has 130-Pound Cancerous Tumor Removed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A woman who feared to seek medical help
as a tumor swelled in her abdomen eventually doubled her weight
before having the 130-pound malignant growth removed, her doctor
said Wednesday.
   Barbara Louise Jones, 55, is almost completely recovered from
the December operation to remove the ovarian tumor, said Fort Worth
surgeon Dr. J.E. Way.
   ``I went to the doctor Monday and my blood pressure is up a
little, but other than that, I'm doing fine,'' said Miss Jones, who
is 5-foot-1{.
   In the three years preceeding her operation, Miss Jones said she
at first thought she was gaining weight, then realized something
was seriously wrong.
   But Miss Jones said she delayed seeing a doctor because she
feared she would suffer the same type of painful death as her
mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 1973. Her maternal
grandfather and an uncle also died of cancer.
   She was forced to retire early from her job as a school district
purchasing agent last March. By July, she was unable to drive a car
or move about without tiring.
   In November, she finally decided to seek medical attention and
was referred to Way. Within two weeks, the tumor was removed.
   Way said he had to cut a 4{-foot incision in Miss Jones' abdomen
to remove the malignant tumor. He said most ovarian tumors are
detected when they are 1-1{ inches.
   ``There's nothing typical about this,'' Way said. ``You can find
a lot of tumors that weigh 5 to 30 pounds, and those are humongous
tumors.''
   The 1988 Guinness Book of World Records lists a 1905 case of a
328-pound ovarian cyst as the largest tumor in history. Oddly
enough, the woman in that case also was from Texas; the reference
book says she recovered fully.
   Way said the tumor was fixed to the walls of Miss Jones' abdomen
and stretched her skin almost paper-thin. He said what made the
surgery difficult was keeping the taut skin from breaking and the
tumor from rupturing.
   If the surgery had not been done, Way said, more tumors could
have developed, the tumor could have become so large it would have
caused respiratory problems, it could have ruptured and spread
cancer throughout her body, or it could have blocked her ability to
digest food.
   He said that all of the cancerous growth was removed and
although Miss Jones must have regular checkups for a recurrence,
she is now in good health.
   Miss Jones said she would recommend that others who suspect they
have cancer to see their physicians early.
   ``I realize now how dangerous it can be and could have been for
me,'' she said.

<HEAD>Commission Says Corruption Caused Hospital Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOMBAY, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A commission probing the deaths of 14
hospital patients has accused two former state health ministers of
corruption, misuse of power and other charges, according to a
report submitted Wednesday to state lawmakers.
   The report by Chaktawar Lentin, a retired Bombay High Court
judge, also criticized what it called widespread corruption among
government officials responsible for overseeing health care and the
pharmaceutical industry.
   Lentin, whose report was submitted to the Maharashtra state
assembly Wednesday by the current state health minister, Ram Meghe,
recommended criminal investigations of Bhai Sawant and Baliram
Hiray, two former health ministers.
   Lentin's report said the two were ``guilty of corruption, misuse
of ministerial power and authority, dereliction of duty and (were)
unfit to hold a ministerial post.''
   Sawant told the assembly he denied the allegations.
   Meghe announced that inquiries would be held.
   The state government set up the commission following the deaths
of 14 patients at the J.J. Hospital in Bombay after they were given
contaminated glycerine in January and February 1986.
   Lentin's report was completed nearly four months ago but his
findings were not made public until this week.
   Critics have charged that the state government's decision not to
release the report until Wednesday encouraged slipshod work in
India's drug companies.
   Lentin said that the medication linked to the deaths of the 14
hospital patients had been mixed with the lethal diethylene glycol.
It was manufactured at the Alpana Pharma Company located in Nanded,
a town in Maharashtra.
   The commission also said it found corruption among senior
officials of the government's Food and Drug Administration. The
report said that inquiries should be held into the behavior of four
senior officials of the agency.
   ``The entire structure of the (agency) has been corroded by
rampant and unabashed corruption, indiscipline, naked favoritism,
crude nepotism and gross ministerial interference at every stage
and a sense of non-accountability all around,'' Lentin said in his
report.
   The state government announced the suspension of four doctors at
the J.J. Hospital on recommendation of the commission. Charges will
also be filed against four drug manufacturing companies.

   Premier-designate Ciriaco De Mita told leaders of
his Christian Democratic Party on Wednesday he is close to
agreement with Socialist leader Bettino Craxi on forming a
government.
   It would be Italy's 48th government since World War II.
   ``The forecast is by next week the Cabinet will be formed,''
said Christian Democratic official Francesco D'Onofrio, who was at
the meeting.
   President Francesco Cossiga tapped De Mita after Premer Giovanni
Goria, also a Christian Democrat, resigned March 11. Many consider
De Mita, the leader of the dominant Christian Democrats, the most
powerful politician in Italy.
   Still, he has been forced to negotiate his program point by
point with Craxi, who heads the second largest party in the
proposed coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Republicans,
Social Democrats and Liberals.
   De Mita told party leaders Wednesday that agreement was near on
most issues that must be resolved to win approval from the proposed
coalition parties, D'Onofrio said. The premier-designate said that
one difficulty still to be overcome was distribution of Cabinet
posts, D'Onofrio reported.
   He said De Mita also needs one important concession from his own
party _ permission to remain party leader for another year.
   Defections by Christian Democrats in secret votes in Parliament
hindered Goria's ability to govern from the beginning.

   Customs authorities said they seized 198 pounds of
Colombian cocaine with a street value of about $22 million
Wednesday and arrested two men.
   A Customs and Excise spokesman, who under British practice
refused to be identified, said it was the second largest haul of
cocaine in Britain.
   Earlier, Customs said it seized two tons of marijuana, worth
about $5.6 million, at Tilbury docks in east London from a
container ship that came from Port Harcourt, Nigeria.
   Six men and a woman were charged Wednesday with smuggling the
marijuana, which Customs said was hidden in a cargo of compressed
rubber bales. Initial discoveries of the cache were made more than
two weeks ago.
   Customs agents from London's Heathrow Airport made the cocaine
haul but officials refused to give details except to say the two
arrests were in Surrey, a county neighboring London.
   Last November, Customs found 457 pounds of cocaine worth about
$90 million in a container on a ship at Southampton.

   A Contra radio station said Wednesday
the U.S.-backed rebels had attacked Sandinista soldiers, violating
a truce days before a formal 60-day cease-fire was set to go into
effect.
   Government and rebel representatives ended two days of technical
meetings Tuesday night by agreeing to set up five zones in which
the rebels were to gather on Friday, the start of the cease-fire.
   An agreement signed last week by the leftist Sandinista
government and the Contras called for the cease-fire in an effort
to end more than six years of war.
   Both sides declared a truce March 21, the start of the
unprecedented talks that produced the fragile peace agreement. But
reports reaching the capital this week indicated several violations
by the Contras.
   A transcript of a broadcast Wednesday by the rebel's clandestine
Radio September 15 said: ``Nicaraguan Resistance commandos cause
casualties to the pro-Soviet army.''
   It was not clear how the reported violations would affect peace
talks.
   According to the transcript, the Honduras-based radio station
reported three attacks by Contra troops on government soldiers in
Zelaya province along the Caribbean coast and in northern Matagalpa
province. It did not say when the raids took place.
   The Defense Ministry said it had no reports of combat. But the
pro-Sandinista newspaper El Nuevo Diario quoted unidentified
military sources as saying Contra rebels killed four civilians and
kidnapped two Saturday in central Chontales province.
   There also have been reports that renegade rebels opposed to the
cease-fire agreement are staging attacks.
   A communique at the end of technical talks held Monday and
Tuesday in the southern border town of Sapoa said the two sides had
agreed in general terms on the size and location of the cease-fire
zones.
   Two zones will be in the northern part of the country, two on
the Caribbean coast and one in the south, it said. Their exact
locations were not disclosed.
   Last week's peace pact does not mention the laying down of arms,
an issue that will likely be discussed in the next technical
meeting, set for April 5, or discussions scheduled for April 6 in
Managua between high-ranking Sandinista and Contra leaders.
   On Monday, Contra commander Diogenes Hernandez Membreno, known
as Fernando, vowed that the combatants would not put down their
arms ``until Nicaragua is a democracy.''
   Under the peace agreement, the Sandinistas will grant freedom of
expression, release political prisoners and allow rebel leaders to
take part in national talks. The Contras, in turn, agreed to gather
in the cease-fire zones and accept only humanitarian aid from a
neutral organization, such as the International Red Cross.
   In Washington, the House if Representatives overwhelmingly
approved a $48 million package of humanitarian aid Wednesday for
the Contras and for children injured in the fighting.
   The bill was portrayed as a gesture of U.S. support for the
temporary truce and for continuing talks aimed at achieving a
long-term end to hostilities.
   U.S. aid to the Contras ended Feb. 29.
   In Miami, the chief Contra military field commander, Col.
Enrique Bermudez, told reporters he supports the truce agreement
and will comply with it. He has expressed reservations, saying he
doesn't trust the Sandinistas, but he said Wednesday his concerns
do not mean he opposes Contra leadership on the issue.
   The transcript of the rebel radio broadcast Wednesday cautioned
Contra combatants that agents of the ``communist Sandinista
dictatorship'' were telling troops the war had ended and they
should put down their arms.
   ``The arms of the commandos of liberty are the only guarantee
for the Nicaraguan people, and these (arms) will never be turned in
while Nicaragua is not a free and just democracy,'' it said.
   Most Nicaraguans turned their thoughts away from the war and
began vacations to mark Holy Week. Many looked for gasoline, which
is in short supply, to fuel their trips to the Pacific coastal
beaches.
   Banks, government offices, stores and most restaurants closed on
Wednesday.
   La Prensa, the opposition newspaper, took the rest of the week
off, citing a shortage of Soviet-supplied newsprint. The two
government papers were closed until Monday.

   The chairman of Harrods department store, where
bluebloods browse, played hired helper for a day Wednesday, slicing
meat at the butcher's counter.
   Other executives joined Mohamed al-Fayed in serving customers,
because the boss believes ``everyone has to feel that the customer
comes first, always first.''
   The Egyptian entrepreneur and his two brothers bought the huge
store in fasionable Knightsbridge three years ago.
   ``People have to feel that you are just like them, not the man
who owns the place,'' said al-Fayed, who wore a straw hat with his
cleaver Wednesday.
   Executives ``should not just sit there like gods, they should
experience the contact with the customer,'' he said.
   He is a ``practical man,'' Al-Fayed said, and enjoyed working at
the meat counter. He helped out for a time in fruit department too,
accompanied by a bodyguard.
   Harrods was founded by Charles Harrod in 1849. Al-Fayed began a
$320 million restoration in 1987 that will take 3{ years. He and
his brothers bought Harrods and the parent House of Fraser PLC for
$984 million in March 1985.

   Marxist rebels raided two farm
cooperatives operated by peasants, killing a manager at each
operation and destroying agriculture equipment, police said
Wednesday.
   About 30 guerrillas of the leftist Shining Path movement
attacked a sugar cane and fruit farm Tuesday in the Andes
foothills, about 70 miles north of Lima, police said. On Monday,
rebels raided a grain and cattle operation near Huancayo, about 130
miles east of Lima.
   The rebels accused the manager of each farm of supporting the
government and shot and killed them, police said. The rebels blew
up trucks and tractors before withdrawing, police said.
   The cooperatives are among dozens organized by the government
and operated by peasants. Rebels have repeatedly attacked such
farms in an effort to derail government efforts to improve Peru's
agricultural system.
   The Mao-inspired Shining Path, which seeks to install a Marxist
regime, launched its insurgency in the impoverished rural highlands
nearly eight years ago. The government says more than 10,000

   One nephew of Mayor W. Wilson Goode remained
in serious condition Wednesday with leg wounds and another
continued refusing to cooperate with police in a separate shooting,
authorities said.
   James Goode, 30, was shot Monday night during a robbery in a
house that neighbors said is a drug users' hangout, according to
police. His cousin Arnold Goode, 26, was shot in the left hand last
week outside a gas station, police said.
   James Goode remained in serious but stable condition Wednesday
at the Misericordia Division of Mercy Catholic Medical Center,
according to the Ellen Karasik, the hospital's director of
communications.
   Police said he was robbed of about $90.
   Officers arrived to find 59-year-old Thomas Fuller, who lives at
the house, at the door and Goode lying on the floor. Fuller said he
was upstairs when the shooting occurred, and he rushed down in time
to see a man with a shotgun run out the door, according to police.
   Police said Wednesday they did not know why Goode was in the
house.
   Lt. Joseph Witte said police had not confirmed neighbors'
statements about drugs at the house.
   ``The only thing we have is what the neighbors say it is,'' he
said.
   Police have issued a warrant for Anthony Stokes, charging him
with aggravated assault, simple assault, burglary and robbery. ``I
believe he was identified by a witness in the house,'' Witte said.
   Meanwhile, Arnold Goode continued to refuse to cooperate in the
investigation of his shooting March 22, Witte said.
   After the shooting, Goode checked into the
Presbyterian-University of Pennsylvania Medical Center with a
gunshot wound to his left hand but left abruptly before the
consultation ended.
   The mayor has acknowledged that both men are his nephews but has
refused further comment.

   Pe-Pe, the father of Mexico's beloved panda
family, was put under medical observation after two tumors were
found, the director of the Chapultepec Zoo said Wednesday.
   ``It is a matter of two inflamed tumors, but we have just about
discounted the idea that it could be cancer,'' Maria Elena Hoyo
said.
   China gave Pe-Pe and his mate, Ying-Ying, to Mexico in September
1975. They have four surviving offspring by natural conception, the
largest such panda family outside of China.
   Ms. Hoyo said a general examination is planned April 11 or 12 to
determine what caused the tumors.
   She said the 13-year-old panda weighs 249 pounds, down from his
usual 275 to 285 pounds. Pandas have a life expectancy of about 20
years.

<HEAD>Rights Group Probes IRA Slayings By British Troops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International said Wednesday that British
soldiers who killed three unarmed IRA members on Gibraltar may have
deliberately avoided capturing them, killing one guerrilla who lay
wounded on the ground.
   The London-based human rights group said it is investigating the
killings and has written Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher asking
for an explanation of what happened.
   The group said ``there are a number of circumstances which
suggest that the three were deliberately targeted by the security
forces and killed without challenge, and that no attempt had been
made to capture them.''
   The letter to Mrs. Thatcher said it ``was the government's
responsibility to provide a full and public account of the
circumstances surrounding this incident,'' an Amnesty statement
said.
   British security forces shot the three March 6 as they walked
toward the Spanish border on the British island colony. Britain
said the Irish Republican Army members planned to plant a bomb on
Gibraltar.
   The shooting aggravated British-Irish relations and was followed
by an upsurge of violence in the British province of Northern
Ireland.
   At the burial of the guerrillas March 16, a Protestant gunman
armed with grenades killed three people and injured 68. At the
funeral three days later for one of those victims, a mob attacked
and killed two British soldiers who drove into the area.
   Amnesty said the three guerrillas were watched for weeks while
they allegedly planned a bombing attack but no attempt was made to
arrest them during this period.
   The statement quoted witnesses as saying the three were shot
without warning and ``that at least one of the victims, having
fallen to the ground after an initial gunshot, was shot several
times while lying helpless and incapacitated.''
   It noted that the government rejected demands for an inquiry
into the shootings, despite such calls by lawmakers.
   Amnesty also said it intends to send observers to the inquest
into the deaths, expected to be held in Gibraltar in May.
   The mainly Roman Catholic Irish Republican Army is fighting to
end British rule in Northern Ireland. It wants to unite the
predominantly Protestant province with the mainly Catholic Republic
of Ireland.
   Since sectarian and political violence flared in Northern
Ireland in 1969, 391 British soldiers and 172 members of the Ulster
Defense Regiment, a locally recruited militia, have been killed
there.

   Wildlife officials who found three
``cold, frightened'' abandoned black bear cubs in a telephone booth
said Wednesday they're questioning a suspect who claims he fatally
shot the bears' mother in self-defense.
   The mother's head and claws were found in a Bay City-area
residence Tuesday night after Department of Natural Resources
officials received a tip on its toll-free poaching hotline, said
Lt. Jay Larson of the department's Mio office.
   ``He's claiming it was self-defense,'' Larson said of the
suspect, whom he would not identify. ``He's claiming he was out
rabbit hunting and the bear attacked him.''
   The suspect on Wednesday led wildlife officials to the bear's
carcass in a swamp in the Au Sable State Forest in Crawford County,
in the northern Lower Peninsula.
   Mark Lutz, a state conservation officer, rescued the cubs last
week after an anonymous caller said he had found them in a trash
container in rural Crawford County. The man said he would leave
them in a telephone booth from where he was calling, 18 miles east
of Grayling.
   The caller was gone when Lutz arrived. But the cubs, two males
and one female about 2 months old, were in a milk crate wrapped in
canvas.
   ``They were cuddled up, cold, frightened and wet,'' Lutz said.
   The cubs have been turned over to the Wildlife Recovery
Association in Midland, which will attempt to find a permanent home
for the bears, probably in zoos. The past week of handling by
humans probably has left them unable to return to the wild, said
caretaker Barb Rogers.
   Larson said it was unclear who placed the original anonymous
call to the department, but guesses it may have been one of three
people who were in the rabbit hunting party.
   The suspect is not being held and no charges have been filed,
but there may be charges filed later, Larson said.
   Before the animals were turned over to the Wildlife Recovery
Association, Lutz and his wife, June, cared for them at their
Grayling home.
   The cubs joined the Lutzes' 9-week-old daughter in being
bottle-fed, Mrs. Lutz said. The couple carefully let their
3{-year-old daughter and visitors to the house watch and pet the
7-pound animals.
   ``They had a cute little growl,'' Mrs. Lutz said, but added:
``They had pretty good claws on them already. They were teething,
like a puppy.''
   Within two years, the bears will weigh 200 to 300 pounds.

   A former U.S. Marine who allegedly led
a coup attempt against President Samuel Doe has killed himself, the
government said Wednesday, and 13 other people have been charged
with treason.
   Government spokesman Emmanuel Bowier said Joseph Robert Kaipaye
committed suicide in view of police, but he did not say how.
Unconfirmed reports said Kaipaye jumped from a sixth-floor window
of the Executive Mansion.
   Officials said Kaipaye was the purported leader of a plot to
assassinate Doe and take over the government, but no details about
him were given, including his birthplace and his military service.
   Twelve people were arrested on March 22, including Gabriel
Kpolleh, leader of the banned opposition Liberia Unification Party,
and another alleged ploter later turned himself in to police,
Bowier said.
   He said three more people were arrested later and six men
remained at large, including a captain and two army sergeants.
   Police confiscated M-16 rifles, Uzi submachine guns, hand
grenades an M-1 rifle and military uniforms, Bowier said.
   The government said the plotters met March 16 to plan Doe's
assassination and the overthrow of his government. It said they
planned to display Doe's body on national television.
   Bowier said none of those apprehended was executed. He said only
that Kaipaye committed suicide, in the presence of another
defendant, after talking with his wife and a friend.
   Bowier said some of the accused people were cooperating in the
police investigation.
   Doe came to power in a bloody April 1980 coup and has been the
target of several assassination attempts. An attempted coup on Nov.
12, 1985, resulted in more than 600 deaths and the destruction of
the village of the ringleader, former Brig. Gen Thomas Quiwonkpa,
who was killed in the attempt.

<TEXT>
   The Arizona Senate dismissed the most
serious of three impeachment charges against Gov. Evan Mecham on
Wednesday and moved toward considering a verdict on the two charges
already heard.
   The vote was a surprise to most involved, including the senator
who made the motion, Republican Wayne Stump, who had predicted it
would get no more than three votes.
   Several of those who voted to dismiss said they were doing so in
order to avoid prejudicing Mecham's upcoming criminal trial on the
charge that he concealed a $350,000 campaign loan. That would have
been the subject of evidence on the third impeachment charge and
Stump said it would have put the governor in ``quasi-double
jeopardy.''
   The motion passed on a simple majority with 16 of those present
voting in favor and 12 voting no. Two senators were absent.
   Mecham refused to comment directly on the trial, saying it would
be ``inappropriate.'' But in an upbeat speech to Republican
precinct committeemen a few hours after the Senate vote, he said he
was confident that he would not be removed from office.
   ``I can get along with the Legislature an let bygones be bygones
as far as I'm concerned and we can work together,'' Mecham said.
``I'm here to serve the people of Arizona.''
   Those who voted yes to dropping the third impeachment count
included all 11 Senate Democrats, leading to speculation that the
Democrats believe they have enough votes to oust the Republican
governor from office without hearing the third count.
   But Democratic Sen. Peter Rios disputed the theory, saying he
had other reasons for voting as he did.
   ``I think this needs to be brought to a conclusion,'' he said of
the 5-week-old impeachment trial, ``and this is my view of one way
to bring it to a conclusion.''
   It would take a two-thirds Senate vote to remove Mecham. If he
is convicted, Senators could then take another vote and bar him
from ever holding office again. In his criminal trial, he faces a
potential maximum sentence of 22 years in prison if convicted.
   The Senate vote was to dismiss the third count ``with
prejudice,'' meaning the senators could not decide to change their
minds and reinstate the charge at a later date.
   Mecham's lawyers, Jerris Leonard and Fred Craft, were jubilant
as they left the Senate. Leonard said he would tell Mecham:
``Governor _ one down and two to go!''
   ``We should not put Gov. Mecham or any other person in double
jeopardy,'' said Democrat Jones Osborn of Yuma.
   Before the vote, other senators had urged putting the third
charge in abeyance while they vote on the first two, which allege
that Mecham misused $80,000 from a protocol fund and obstructed and
investigation of an alleged death threat by a staff member.
   ``If the governor is exonerated, he ought to know that so he can
go on to other things,'' said Democrat Carolyn Walker. ``If he is
convicted, the state ought not to have to go through the agony of
this trial a day longer.''
   The governor's trial on felony charges related to the $350,000
campaign loan begins April 21 in Maricopa County Superior Court.
Mecham, 63, the first U.S. governor to face an impeachment trial in
six decades, also faces a recall election May 17.
   The Senate's action cleared the way for final arguments to begin
on the two remaining counts originally lodged by the House or
Representatives. Arizona Supreme Court Chief Justice Frank X.
Gordon told senators to return Thursday to discuss proposed legal
instructions. He said the trial would then recess until Monday when
arguments would be heard.
   The surprise decision came after the senators heard rebuttal
prosecution testimony on the second of the three charges against
the governor, then met in secret for nearly an hour to discuss
whether to continue with the third charge or take a shortcut.
   The secret session was held over objections from Republican Sen.
Peter Kay who said he felt the public was entitled to hear debate
on such a crucial issue.
   In her rebuttal testimony, a former bookkeeper for Mecham's car
dealership accused Mecham's son Dennis of lying under oath.
   ``I felt the truth should be known,'' said Lee Christman, who
portrayed Mecham Pontiac as plagued with unpaid bills in July 1987,
when the governor took a disputed $80,000 loan from a protocol fund.
   She said she came forward to testify ``when I heard Dennis lie.''
   The first allegation about which the Senate heard testimony was
that Mecham tried to thwart an investigation into an alleged death
threat by a staff member.
   Mecham says his car dealership didn't need the $80,000 loan from
the protocol fund and his son testified last week that the car
dealership in suburban Glendale was in glowing financial health at
the time.
   The prosecution says Mecham Pontiac needed money desperately,
and the governor misused state funds to get it. The defense
contends the money was private.
   Dennis Mecham announced Tuesday that the dealership has been
sold because of plummeting sales. He blamed bad publicity
engendered by his father's political battles.
   Under questioning by prosecutor William French, Ms. Christman
testified that Mecham Pontiac needed at least $497,000 in July just
to pay its bills.
   ``We had trouble through May and June,'' she said. ``It became
critical that funds had to be brought in.''
   Defense attorney Jerris Leonard, trying to paint Ms. Christman
as a disgruntled fired employee, noted that she had contacted
prosecutors before she was subpoenaed to testify.
   ``You took the effort to contact them?'' asked Leonard.
   ``Yes, when I heard Dennis lie,'' she said.
   She explained later that she felt the younger Mecham improperly
blamed her for bookkeeping problems she had inherited from a former
employee. Her testimony also indicated that Dennis Mecham had lied
about the business' financial shape and his father's motivation for
borrowing the funds.
   Mecham, a first-term Republican, is accused of misusing the
funds raised by his inaugural committee. He has said he made the
$80,000 loan only because he wanted to increase the fund by paying
higher interest than it was getting at the bank.
   He also testified he was aware of no particular financial
problems at Mecham Pontiac and didn't keep up with the business
regularly after his son took over as general manager in 1986.

   A man turned down for residency at a
apartment because of his blindness says he'll drop a discrimination
complaint now that he's been accepted as a tenant.
   Larry Tomecek, 35, says he'll move within a few weeks into a
$350-per-month apartment at a condominium building at Deerfield
Beach.
   ``These people said they are sorry, that they made a mistake,''
he said Tuesday at a news conference at his attorney's office here.
``I accept their apology.''
   Tomecek has lived with his parents near Delray Beach since the
condo directors rejected his application on Feb. 22, saying they
feared that he might cause a fire or trip on stairs and that they
might be sued.
   Tomecek's discrimination claim in Broward County also will be
dropped as soon as the Keswick B Condominium association picks up
moving costs for his personal belongings, which are in storage,
said Larry Corman, Tomecek's attorney.
   ``I'm glad it ends on a happy note,'' said Morris Barnett, one
of five Keswick B directors. ``We want to help him and everything.
It should have never happened, and I'm glad it's straightened out.
We want to get a truck and move the stuff in for him.''

   U.N. talks on a cease-fire in the Persian
Gulf war hit a snag Tuesday as Iran put off sending an envoy to New
York as promised.
   Talks between Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and a
high-level Iranian official, scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday,
were delayed indefinitely at Iran's request, U.N. officials said.
No reason was given.
   Iraq was to send an envoy next Monday and Tuesday, but the
postponement and Iranian charges of chemical warfare by Baghdad
were expected to delay, if not scuttle, the discussions.
   Perez de Cuellar had invited both Iran and Iraq to send
representatives for the fourth round of talks since the Security
Council adopted a cease-fire resolution last July 20. He has
expressed frustration at the delay in putting a truce into effect.
   Iran's envoy was expected to be the deputy foreign minister,
Mohammad Larijani. Iraq had not named a representative.
   Diplomats were pessimistic about a breakthrough and halt to the
7{-year-old conflict. They cited a bitter Iraqi letter to Perez de
Cuellar on Monday and his own sharp retort, and an increase in gulf
warfare.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Azia on Monday sent a letter
attacking the secretary-general for allegedly siding with Iran. The
U.N. chief retorted Tuesday that Iraqi charges were out of place.
   The United States has been pushing for an arms embargo against
Iran to force the Tehran government to comply with the cease-fire.
   The diplomatic situation has been complicated by reports of
Iraqi use of chemical weapons. Iran charged that more than 5,000
people, mostly Iraqi Kurds, were killed and 7,000 injured in
chemical weapons attacks earlier this month. It said the worst-hit
area was territory in Iraq that had been captured by Iran.

<TEXT>
   A woman who a prosecutor said had an
``obsession to have a child'' was found guilty but mentally ill
Tuesday of first-degree murder in the death of a pregnant woman who
was strangled and her baby crudely cut from her womb.
   The state district court jury also found Darci Pierce guilty but
mentally ill of kidnapping and child abuse charges. The seven-man,
five-woman jury returned the verdicts after about six hours of
deliberations over two days.
   Mrs. Pierce, 20, had pleaded innocent by reason of insanity in
the July 23, 1987, death of Cindy Lynn Ray, 23, who was 8{ months
pregnant.
   Authorities said Mrs. Ray was abducted from the parking lot of a
Kirtland Air Force Base health clinic and was driven to the Manzano
Mountains east of Albuquerque, where she was strangled and a key
was used to cut her unborn bay from her body. The baby survived.
   Mrs. Pierce was arrested after she went to an Albuquerque
hospital with a newborn girl and doctors determined she had not
given birth.
   Both Mrs. Pierce and the victim were married to airmen at the
Kirtland base.
   District Judge Richard Traub set sentencing for April 29. Mrs.
Pierce could receive life imprisonment on the murder conviction, an
additional 18 years on the kidnapping charge and 18 months on the
child-abuse charge.
   In his closing arguments Monday, Assistant District Attorney
Harry Zimmerman said the evidence showed Mrs. Pierce had planned
her actions and knew what she was doing.
   Zimmerman said Mrs. Pierce elected to take a baby ``to satisfy
her obsession to have a child and, perhaps more important, to save
her marriage.''
   But defense attorney John Bogren, a public defender, told jurors
that witnesses during the trial testified Mrs. Pierce suffered from
a mental illness and multiple personality disorder.
   ``It is a bizarre crime. It deserves a bizarre explanation,''
Bogren said.
   Under state law, a jury finding of guilty but mentally ill means
the person does not meet the legal tests for insanity but had a
substantial mental disorder that impaired judgment at the time of
the crime.
   The defendant is subject to standard sentences but the state
Corrections Department is required to provide counseling and
treatment ``as it deems necessary.''
   Bogren said an appeal will be filed.
   Mrs. Ray's husband, Samuel, returned to his home state of Utah
with the infant girl, named Amelia, and her 2-year-old brother.

<TEXT>
   Veterans groups Tuesday praised a state
Supreme Court decision overturning the death sentence of a killer
of two young girls because testimony about his combat trauma in
Vietnam was barred.
   ``The news from California is very welcome,'' Barry Kasinitz,
spokesman for the 38,000-member Vietnam Veterans of America, said
hearing of Phillip Lucero's successful appeal.
   ``Post-traumatic stress disorder is in fact curable in many
instances,'' Kasinitz said. ``The biggest problem with the death
penalty is that it's the only penalty that's not reversible.''
   Just two weeks ago, another Vietnam veteran, Wayne Felde, died
in Louisiana's electric chair after arguing unsuccessfully that
flashbacks from Vietnam drove him to murder.
   ``I am appalled that the American people are willing to execute
Vietnam veterans who may be imprisoned through no fault of their
own,'' said veterans activist George Gorman of Redondo Beach,
Calif., who receives disability benefits for post-Vietnam trauma.
``I consider that an act of vengeance and blood lust.''
   The seven justices unanimously reversed Lucero's death sentence
Monday, saying potentially favorable evidence, some of it related
to his reaction to Vietnam, was excluded from the penalty phase of
his trial.
   The court upheld the conviction of Lucero, 42, for murdering
neighbor girls ages 7 and 10 in Yucaipa in April 1980. Lucero's
sentence will not automatically revert to the alternative of life
without possibility of parole, however, because the court voted 6-1
not to rule out a new penalty trial.
   Prosecutor John Kochis of San Bernardino County said his office
would review the ruling and check availability of witnesses from
the 1981 trial before deciding whether to seek a new sentencing
trial.
   Justice Stanley Mosk, the lone dissenter who wanted the court to
order a life sentence for Lucero, said he did not mean to
countenance violence by veterans.
   ``I do believe, however, that this defendant deserves compassion
from a society that in the first instance taught him to kill,''
Mosk said.
   California is not among the several states that have laws
explicitly allowing a defense based on post-Vietnam stress, said
Michael Satris, Lucero's lawyer.
   Lucero spent 7{ years in the Army, much of it in Vietnam, after
lying about his age and enlisting at 16. A psychiatrist testified
that he had the symptoms of post-traumatic stress _ emotional
isolation, sleep disturbance, loss of memory and concentration,
``survivor guilt,'' and recurrent flashbacks.
   On the day of the killings, the psychiatrist said, Lucero,
already under stress from marital problems, may have suffered
flashbacks triggered by the cackling of a goose and the sound of
police helicopters searching for the girls.
   The psychiatrist was allowed to testify, but was attacked by the
prosecution as a ``hired gun.'' The court said a counselor from a
Veterans Administration hospital, who was prepared to testify that
Lucero was probably driven by post-Vietnam trauma, might have been
more persuasive but was not allowed to testify.

   Republican Bob Dole, who for one winter week
looked like a good bet for the Republican presidential nomination,

   In an ad-libbed addition to his prepared speech, Dole promised

election, as senators refused to guarantee warnings to workers
facing on-the-job exposure to toxic chemicals.
   The Senate's rejection on Tuesday of a bill to require notice
for workers exposed to carcinogens and other job hazards ended a

industry-labor showdowns, the Senate had approved measures to ban
most uses of lie detector tests and require advance notice of plant
closings.

   Reducing class size in public schools is very

seeking improved student achievement, according to a study issued
Wednesday by the Department of Education.
   There now are 24 pupils in the typical public elementary school
classroom, down from 30 in 1961. Past research has indicated
classes would have to be reduced to 15 students to have any
appreciable impact on student impact, the study said.
   But that would cost upwards of $69 billion and require the
hiring of 1 million new teachers at a time when schools already are
having difficulty filling faculty vacancies, according to Tommy M.

   For many years, French filmmaker Louis Malle
didn't think he wanted to deal with a very traumatic memory of his
childhood.
   ``It was like my secret, something I didn't want to talk about,
even less so make a film about,'' he said. ``But it stuck with me
so vividly that 10 years ago I decided to give it a try.''
   The result of his painful recollection is ``Au Revoir Les
Enfants'' (``Goodbye, Children''), one of the five nominees for the
Academy Award for best foreign language film of 1987.
   ``Au Revoir Les Enfants'' epitomizes the kind of films entered
this year in Oscar's foreign-language category. Most of the movies
are highly personal, either in the subject matter or the years of
devotion given to the project by the filmmaker. The other nominees
are:
   _ ``Babette's Feast'' (Denmark), based on a short story by Isak
Dinesen, tells of two unmarried and very pious sisters who take a
French political refugee, Babette, into their home in Norway in
return for housekeeping. She later repays them with her art: the
feast. The director, Gabriel Axel, spent 14 years trying to get his
movie made.
   _ ``Course Completed'' (Spain), about a depressed writer who
escapes to the seashore after a failure and is followed by an old
flame and his bothersome son. The film was co-written, produced and
directed by Jose Luis Garcia.
   _ ``The Family'' (Italy), an epic history of 80 years in the
life of a Roman family, told with loving care by Ettore Scola (``La
Bal'').
   _ ``Pathfinder'' (Norway), written and directed by Nils Gaup, a
tale of revenge by a Lapp boy whose family is killed in a raid.
   Malle based ``Au Revoir Les Enfants'' on his experience as a boy
of 11 during the German occupation of France. His well-to-do Paris
family sent him to the safety of a Catholic boarding school in
Fontainebleau. There he became friends with a brilliant Jewish boy
who was being hidden from the Gestapo by a priest. The ruse was
uncovered, and three Jewish boys as well as the head priest were
sent to their deaths in concentration camps.
   ``I began writing notes when I was making a film of the same
period, `Lacombe Lucien' (1974),'' Malle remarked in an interview.
``I decided there were little things there, but not necessarily a
film.
   ``After I had been working in America a few years, all those
things came back, maybe because I was far from home. My childhood
returned so strongly that I tried to put it into a screenplay.
   ``Maybe I decided to make peace with (my memories),'' he said.
``Also I reached the point that I thought I should give it away,
that it was interesting enough to make it into a film so other
people could share it with me.
   ``From that point I was really exhilarated and excited. I wasn't
sure I would make a good film, but I was sure the material was
really strong. Once I had the first draft of the screenplay, I
started preproduction and I worked with great enthusiasm. It was
like a deliverance in a way.''
   Malle told his associates from the beginning that he would not
make the film unless he found two remarkable children for the
leading roles because they had to carry the whole movie. After
interviewing hundreds of Parisian boys over a five-month period, he
found his actors: Gaspard Manesse and Raphael Pejto, both
inexperienced in film work.
   Axel is a Danish director who has divided his career between his
native land and France. He became obsessed with a Dinesen story
about a woman who escaped a 19th-century French revolution to serve
as cook for a pair of devout spinsters in a remote Danish village.
Formerly a world-class chef, the refugee (Stephane Audran) devotes
her entire winnings in a lottery to a feast in honor of the
spinsters' late minister-father.
   ``Fourteen years ago when I tried to make the film, the French
said, `OK,' the Danes said, `no,''' recalled Axel, who needed the
backing of both countries. ``I went from producer to producer to
producer, and they said, `You can't make a film with no story, no
action, no dialogue.' They did not see the possibilities.''
   Axel needed between $2.5 million and $3 million to make
``Babette's Feast.'' He could understand the Danish reluctance:
``There are only 5 million people in Denmark, and even if every one
of them went to the movie, it would not be enough to show a
profit.''
   The Danish Film Institute finally provided 75 percent of the
budget. With rave reviews and the Academy nomination, the
investment seems secure.
   Following his success with ``Babette's Feast,'' Axel hopes to
film a project he has nurtured for 20 years: a version of
``Hamlet'' based on the earliest histories of the saga from which
Shakespeare borrowed his plot.
   ``The histories tell of the prince returning to Denmark to kill
the uncle who murdered the king,'' Axel said. ``But the original
has a happy ending. Hamlet marries Ophelia, and they live happily
ever after.''

<HEAD>Lebanese Musician Seeks to Fuse Arabic Music And Jazz</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HASAN MROUE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ziad Rahbani has put the chaos and
insanity of war-battered Beirut to music in an attempt to blend
Arabic music and jazz into a new form.
   He calls it ``oriental jazz,'' describing it as ``something like
a hamburger that tastes of felafel,'' a popular Arab snack made of
spicy minced chickpeas and beans.
   The son of Lebanon's most popular singer, Fairouz, Rahbani has
come under fire from Arab traditionalists for his pioneering
efforts to bridge the gap between Arab and Western culture with
music.
   ``Just as automobiles replaced donkeys, traditional music must
develop to reflect the times,'' Rahbani said in an interview.
``Everything has to evolve.''
   His mother, who since the death of Egypt's revered Umm Kalthoum,
is the Arab world's leading singer, has performed some of his
compositions at her sell-out concerts, blending Lebanese folklore
with Western syncopation and phrasing.
   Rahbani, 32, has been working on his concept since the 1970s and
gave his first Oriental jazz concert in war-torn Beirut in 1985.
   One of the fundamental similarities between Arabic and
occidental music, he said, is that both rely on improvisation: ``In
jazz, the same basic tune is played in a different interpretation
by each of the musicians.''
   Oriental string and wind instruments, such as the oud, a sort of
lute, the zither-like qanoun and the nay, a reed flute, are
associated with an improvisation type of music called ``taqssim.''
   Classical Arab singers, such as the legendary Kalthoum, are
famous for often stretching one song for more than a hour. The
style is called ``tafrid,'' repeating one couplet over and over,
but each time subtly different.
   ``It's this personal element or subjectivity that creates the
alteration, although the message is one,'' Rahbani said. ``Another
common factor is the similarity between blues and classical Arabic
songs. Both are melancholic and dragging types of music.''
   Always unconventional, Rahbani plays jazz standards on the oud,
known in the Arab world as the ``king of instruments,'' giving them
unusual harmonies.
   He has adapted well-known jazz compositions, such as Thelonius
Monk's ``Round Midnight,'' with an Oriental interpretation, often
usig Arabic harmonies and rhythms to give the songs a unique tonal
color.
   ``I admire the music of composers like Charley Parker, Stan Getz
and Dizzy Gillespie,'' he said. ``But my music is not Western, it's
Lebanese, with a different way of expression. This interaction
between Oriental and occidental instruments comes out in a natural
harmony.''
   Many Arab purists claim Oriental jazz is an illigitimate form
that has planted alien seeds in classical Arabic music.
   To be sure, Rahbani's music reflects the hybrid heritage of
Lebanon, which until the civil war erupted in 1975, was a cultural
melting pot where East met West. But it also is deeply rooted in
the traumatic events of the sectarian strife, the bloody street
battles between rival militias and three years of violent Israeli
occupation after the 1982 invasion.
   A leftist Greek Orthodox, Rahbani also writes plays and
satirical radio shows centered on his violent environment that mock
the sectarian divisions of his country and the traditional
political thinking that has taken Lebanon to the very brink of
catacylsm.
   His latest record, ``Ana Mush Kafer,'' or ``I'm Not an
Athiest,'' was hailed by most Lebanese _ Christians and Moslems
alike _ as an expression of their miserable political, social and
economic situation.
   One passage says:
   ``We have to sell diamond rings and gold mines
   ``To pay the bill in restaurants
   ``Nothing is left, no health and no job,
   ``Even my home was lit by a shell''
   Rahbani comes from a major musical dynasty in the Arab world.
His father, Assi Rahbani, who died in Beirut in 1986, was one of
the founders of modern Arab music. Together with his lyricist
brother, Mansour, they wrote most of Fairouz's famous songs and
musical plays. Now her son is writing and arranging for her.
   In a recent performance in London's Festival Hall, where the
one-night box-office take of $210,000 broke the record held by
Frank Sinatra, she sang Rahbani's plaintive ``Khalik bil-Bait,'' or
``Stay at Home,'' with an orchestration and phrasing reminiscent of
Ella Fitzgerald. He accompanied his mother on piano.

<HEAD>Moses Is Towering Figure Of Jewish Passover And For Others</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   That champion of liberty and law, Moses, dominates the drama
that the world's Jews celebrate, beginning today at sundown,
recalling humanity's first recorded triumph over tyranny.
   ``Let my people go,'' Moses challenged the Egyptian Pharaoh, who
finally capitulated after a series of plagues and calamities struck
his empire.
   The ensuing escape of the ragged, oppressed throng of Jewish
slaves has animated the cause of freedom in history ever since, and
is the steady refrain of the week-long Passover observance.
   ``Remember the day in which you went forth ... from the house of
bondage, and how the Lord freed you with a mighty hand.''
   The influence of Moses in leading the Israelites out of
enslavement fired offspring religions in toppling other ancient
oppressive regimes. His impact also figured in the early migrations
to freedom in America.
   ``His were the hands that broke the gods of Egypt, Mesopotamia,
Greece,'' writes novelist Herman Wouk. ``Islam and Christianity
stand on his shoulders; both faiths are unthinkable without him.''
   Wouk, author of several best-selling novels, says in a volume
newly published by Little, Brown & Co., ``This Is My God,'' that
the faithful believe Moses talked directly with God.
   ``The record is that he changed history exactly as if he had,''
Wouk adds. ``He disappeared into darkness on a mountain and came
back with a law (the Ten Commandments).
   ``First Israel, and then half the world, accepted that law as
the word of God... There is no God in the West to this hour but the
God of Moses.''
   He was an unlikely choice for his bold undertaking, Wouk notes,
a desert dweller of 80, with a wife and children when he ``was
called by God to do a hard job, and like a man of sense, he tried
to beg off.
   ``Once he put his hand to the task, however, there was no
standing before him. They say a man grows to the stature of his
office. Moses grew to the superhuman size of his job, and grew to
last.''
   Initially, after slaying a brutal Egyptian taskmaster for
beating Jewish workers, Moses had fled to Midian and married a
sheep-owner's daughter.
   But ``the people of Israel groaned under their bondage, and
cried out for help,'' the book of Exodus recounts. And God heard
that cry and knew their suffering.
   When the divine summons came to Moses in a burning bush to go
back, confront Pharoah and deliver the people from enslavement,
Moses demurred, saying ``who am I'' for such heroics?
   ``But I will be with you,'' God assured.
   Moses, then tending his father-in-law's flocks, wasn't even
clear who this God of Israel's forefather's was. ``What is his
name?''
   God, couching his identity in the enigmatic terms of existence
itself, said in that strange passage of response: ``I AM WHO I AM.
... Say this to the people of Israel, `I AM has sent me to you.''
   Moses kept trying to get out of it. ``Oh, my Lord, I am not
eloquent. ... I am slow of speech and tongue,'' and people won't
listen. The account says the argument went on and finally God
angered.
   He insisted he would ``be with your mouth,'' telling Moses what
to say to Pharoah and Moses' brother, Aaron, a great speaker, could
do the talking to the people.
   Moses gave in, returned to Egypt, repeatedly faced the powerful,
hard-boiled Pharaoh, ``Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, `Let
my people go...''
   But Pharaoh spurned it, laying heavier work and harsher
treatment on the enslaved Jews. Again and again, the account says
Moses struck back with divine reprisals, pestilences, flies, frogs,
deaths, the Nile running blood red.
   The ``forces of nature seem to work'' for Moses, Wouk writes.
``Other conquerors and master spirits, in the flood tide of their
lives, have appeared to have command of favoring events.
   ``We call the strange power luck, or destiny, or a star.
Whatever power Moses had, wherever it came from it was enough to
wrest the freedom of a slave people from the grand military tyranny
of the ancient world.''
   It was later that Moses ascended that quaking mountain, wreathed
in smoke. In a crescendo of trumpet sounds, God spoke in thunder,
issuing those lasting Commandments honored by Jews, Christians and
Moslems.
   Since the time Moses ``brought his vision of God to the Earth
there have been the most violent objections ... to the laws he said
were God's laws,'' Wouk writes. ``But his laws still live today.
   ``Challenged more violently than ever, they live ... We call art
inspired when passing years cannot dim it. It is no proof of Moses'
inspiration that his law still lives ... but the rocklike strength
of his law at least makes it one of the marvels of history.''

   Bishops of the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America say ``persons of homosexual orientation'' seeking
ordination or who already are ordained ``are expected to refrain
from homosexual practice.''
   The statement came after three senior seminarians at Pacific
Lutheran Theological Seminary at Berkeley, Calif., announced they
are homosexual and have been assigned as pastoral candidates in
West Coast synods.
   Bishop Herbert W. Chilstrom, head of the denomination, said the
church's ministry embraces all people, including homosexuals, but
the church must set standards for those called as pastors.
   He said the church draws a distinction between homosexual
orientation and homosexual practice, and many denominations have
clergy who may be homosexually oriented, but he added:
   ``The church will not ordain persons who engage in homosexual
behavior nor will it permit such persons to be on the clergy roster
if such pracrtice is discovered.''

   The ``biblical hope'' of Passover, marking
emancipation of the Jews from Egyptian slavery to establish an
independent country, is seen by a Jewish leader as realized anew in
modern Israel.
   With the week-long Passover observance beginning this evening,
Theodore Ellenoff, president of the American Jewish Committee, said
the rebirth of Israel 40 years ago embodies the ancient Passover
goal of a homeland.
   American Jews should ``maintain solidarity with Israel, whatever
differences of opinion might arise over specific issues and
particular policies,'' he said.
   He said the ``centrality of freedom'' was the Passover theme of
deliverance from bondage to a promised land, and that wherever
countries ``restrict the freedom of their inhabitants, Jews must
protest.''

   There is nothing very new about recycling one of
nature's materials, since nature itself has been doing that with
air and water since the very beginning of time.
   But in the 1960s, when the aluminum can was introduced to the
markets and (unfortunately) the highways and recreational areas of
America, recycling was a relatively new idea to business, big
business especially.
   In retrospect, you might wonder why. To reuse aluminum was to
save money, protect the environment and generate the good will any
company needs to succeed in selling its products. It was good
business, but business wasn't sure it was.
   This month the aluminum industry observes the 20th anniversary
of the decision to recycle old cans, food trays, gutters,
downspouts, window blinds, house siding and beach chairs. In doing
so, it looks back on a lesson learned.
   The lesson is that it is foolish to waste, and the proof of it
is in the kind of statistics that industry pays attention to.
   In that time, according to Reynolds Aluminum, which claims to
have begun the first program in March 1968, the industry has
recycled 10.5 billion pounds of the metal, equal to 268 billion
cans.
   In that time it has paid $3.75 billion to collectors, saved 60
billion kilowatt hours of electricity, conserved 18.4 million tons
of bauxite (an import that would have added to the trade deficit),
and created 30,000 jobs.
   Recycling has financed charities, spurred entrepreneurship,
saved highway departments big dollars, provided a third of the
industry's raw materials, and undoubtedly protected companies from
environmental law suits.
   What had been viewed as a problem was really an opportunity _ in
fact, dozens of opportunities. Consider, for example, the enoromous
savings on freight costs through use of lighter-weight containers.
   Without recycling, it is unlikely the aluminum can would have
gained much acceptance, since its virtues, such as corrosion
resistance and durability, make it persist as trash, not only in
landfills but wherever discarded.
   The 1960s was a time for activists. The stirrings of a consumer
revolt were being felt, and environmentalists were making the
nation pollution conscious. It wasn't a fortuitous time to
introduce a can with such qualities.
   Looking back, the environmentalists might have destroyed the
industry in its infancy had recycling not been accepted and
developed.
   As it was, the beginnings weren't smooth. In 1968, when Reynolds
began recycling in Los Angeles, only eight beverages _ three soft
drinks and five beers _ were sold in aluminum cans.
   Few people, even those in the industry, believed recycling could
work on a large scale. ``Many within our own industry thought
large-scale consumer recycling was a pipe dream,'' says William O.
Bourke, Reynolds president.
   ``Much to their surprise,'' he comments in remarks prepared for
the 20th anniversary, ``we recycled one million pounds of aluminum
in that first year, and by 1983, just 15 years later, we were
exceeding that amount daily.''
   Today, according to Reynolds, more than 95 percent of all canned
beer and soft drinks are sold in aluminum.
   While there are lessons in this tale for industry and
government, there is one for individuals, too. If you rip the
siding off your house or decide on new lawn furniture or throw a
big summer party with lots to drink, save the waste.
   Then find yourself a recycling center _ there are 10,000 of them
around the country. You might earn as much as 32 cents a pound for
your troubles. But even if you don't, you'll be doing the
environment a favor.

   A New York retiree who depends on her savings
and investments for income recently asked a broker for some advice.
   She was worried about the volatility of both the bond and stock
markets, and had been especially upset by a dire forecast for the
economy she had heard on television.
   In her situation, she told the broker, she wanted to take the
safest possible approach, even if it meant sacrificing a few
percentage points in yield.
   ``Your money market funds are fine,'' the broker told her. ``And
don't sell that bond fund. If you get out of it now, you'll be
taking a loss.''
   Most financial advisers would give the broker good marks for his
comment on money market mutual funds. But they would flunk him for
his reasoning on the other fund.
   When people make choices about whether to hold or sell an
investment, these advisers say, they should give very little weight
to what has happened in the past. The future is what matters.
   That goes, they add, for any type of investment that fluctuates
in value, be it a stock, bond, mutual fund, real estate or a
baseball card, for that matter.
   ``Waiting until the value of your property is back up to your
purchase price before you sell is irrational,'' says John Reed in
his newsletter Real Estate Investor's Monthly. ``Your purchase
price is irrelevant to your decision to hold or sell.''
   ``Values go up and values go down, and in their going up and
down they may pass the same figure twice. But values DO NOT `come
back' like homing pigeons or rubber bands that have been stretched.
   ``To think that they do is incorrect analysis and can lead to
bad decisions.''
   After the wide swings in many investment markets over the past
year, including the crash in stock prices last October, there are
countless people sitting with paper losses on their investments.
   Even supposedly hard-nosed professionals acknowledge that it is
only human nature to resist selling something at a loss.
   ``In my work as a money manager, I see two powerful emotions
time and time again,'' says Paul Merriman, who publishes an
advisory letter called Fund Exchange:
   _``The desire to break even on an investment _ regardless of how
costly a bullheaded pursuit of this goal may prove;
   _``The desire to buy the past, which manifests itself in the
insistence on purchasing a particular stock, fund or other
investment because it has done well in the past, without taking
into account the amount of risk that may be involved.''
   The choice of selling rather than holding on does have some
consequences that must be considered. All other things being equal,
it is worthwhile to try to time your sales of losing investments
with tax consequences in mind.
   Also, sales of some types of investments involve significant
transaction costs that can't be ignored. And the market for an
out-of-favor investment may be relatively illiquid, so that you
might be faced with accepting a bigger price concession than you
feel comfortable with.
   These and other considerations militate against changing your
mind too often, jumping from one investment to another.
   Still, veterans of the investing wars say, no investment that
falls in value with changing market conditions ``owes'' you your
money back.
   Says Reed: ``All decisions, including a decision to own
property, are choices between alternatives. When confronted with a
choice between alternatives, you should always pick the best one.
   ``That sounds obvious. But many investors clearly lose sight of
it, especially when they get bad news like a value drop.''

   A regulation of the Federal Trade Commission
declares that ``no statement or illustration should be used in an
advertisement which creates a false impression of the usability of
the product offered.''
   The law is violated, according to the regulation, ``if the first
contact or interview is secured by deception.''
   Question: Is an automobile-company finance subsidiary guilty,
therefore, if it advertises a low-low rate on two-year loans,
knowing that most customers will need longer-term loans at higher
rates?
   Some other credit lenders think they are, and they have
petitioned the FTC to rule in their favor. The practice, they say,
``is a classic case of bait-and-switch, and is unlawful under the
FTC Act.''
   As viewed by the Credit Union National Association and the
Independent Bankers Association of America, whose members depend
heavily on income from car loans, the interest-rate promotions hurt
not just them but customers, too.
   Their claim adds another twist to one of the more puzzling
challenges of today's marketplace: What is the price of a car? It
isn't the first time the question was posed.
   In fact, detailed sticker pricing on car windows was among the
primary accomplishments of the consumer movement that began in the
1960s. Before then, not even a cryptographer could foretell with
certainty what you might pay.
   The stickers helped, but still left many questions, in part
because of the number of options available on a particular car. And
like it or not, some cars were available only with the options
included, and others came without them.
   The options themselves, so numerous, present customers with
decisions many feel unqualified to make. Their despair can be
compared to a novice traveler trying to develop, without help from
an agent, a lowest-cost air itenerary.
   When car companies decided to compete with rebates and
below-market interest rates still greater complexity was added to
the challenge. And, say the credit union and banking people, it
made buyers easy targets for sellers.
   In the petition, they state that the cut-rate financing by
Chrysler Financial Corp., Ford Motor Credit Co. and General Motors
Acceptance Corp. often applies only to two-year loans, whereas many
customers need much longer terms.
   Such offers, they say in the petition, are bait to lure
customers into showrooms where, in spite of the low interest rates,
customers first become aware of the unacceptable high monthly
payments on the two-year loans.
   But is it deception? Or is it merely an attempt by intensely
competitve marketers to sell their products in the most enticing
way they know how? The rates are honestly quoted; they're
available, if only for two-year periods.
   And if the automobile financing companies are quilty, what then
can be said about many savings and commercial banks that publicize
high returns on their certificates of deposit _ and quietly
restrict them to larger accounts?
   Basic to all this is the same question that prevailed in the
1960s, when it was widely asserted that consumers were at a
disadvantage in the marketplace because they were amateurs and
sellers were professionals.
   Since then, the consumer has become more aware of how the
marketplace works, the result of legislation, advocacy groups,
education, publicity and honest efforts by sellers to make products
and policies understandable.
   Still, many people suspect that perhaps the ingenuity of the
marketplace pros may have developed more rapidly in the past two
decades than the awareness of customers.

   Bishop Herbert W. Chilstrom, head of the denomination, said the

the church must set standards for those called as pastors.
   He said the church draws a distinction between homosexual
orientation and homosexual practice, and many denominations have
clergy who may be homosexually oriented, but he added:
   ``The church will not ordain persons who engage in homosexual
behavior nor will it permit such persons to be on the clergy roster
if such pracrtice is discovered.''

   It's the big switch, the great turn-about, a
joke on death. Ancient imagery has the resurrected Christ
confronting the Devil and laughing at him about it.
   That's a little known aspect of Easter lore, the zanily
uproarious, upside down funniness of a holiday Christians celebrate
this weekend.
   ``Blessed are you that weep now, for you shall laugh,'' Jesus
said, and the Fellowship of Merry Christians seeks to restore that
bubbling note of laughter to the occasion.
   The ``joke that God played on Satan by raising Jesus from the
dead was indisputably the greatest and most imaginative practical
joke in the history of the world,'' says Carl Samra.
   Samra of Box 668, Kalamazoo, Mich., is coordinator of the
ecumenical fellowship, grown to about 10,000 members, and editor of
its news-and-joke bimonthly, ``The Joyful Noiseletter.''
   The fellowship, which sees humor and delight in faith and
circulates comic anecdotes about it, wants to resurrect an old
Christian custom _ celebrating ``Bright Monday'' _ a day for merry
pranks and frolic.
   Also called ``White Monday,'' it comes the day after Easter, and
according to the fellowship, used to be celebrated as a ``day of
joy and laughter'' by Roman Catholic, Protestant and Eastern
Orthodox believers.
   It's a time for ``the laughing of the redeemed, the dancing of
the liberated,'' writes noted German Protestant theologian Jurgen
Moltman.
   As Jesus put it, ``your sorrow will turn into joy.'' He
reassured his apostles ``that my joy may be in you and that your
joy may be full.''
   Such passages inspired artist R. S. Riddick of Tucson, Ariz., to
paint his sketch of Jesus smiling, ``The Joyful Christ.'' Another
painting, ``Jesus Laughing,'' is by Willis Wheatley of Praise
Screen Prints, Traverse City, Mich.
    The Fellowship of Merry Christians sponsors its ``Holy Humor
Month'' in April, with Monday set for a day of happy festivities _
picnics, singing, dancing, telling jokes and fun.
   Mrs. Soule Papademetriou, librarian at Orthodoxy's Holy Cross
School of Theology in Brookline, Mass., says that in early Greek
tradition, Easter Monday was a ``day of joy and laughter'' at
Christ's triumph over death.
   That zest, games and high spirits continued through ``Bright
Week,'' she says.
   Although origins of the celebration are hazy, she says, it may
have been inspired by an Easter midnight sermon by fourth-century
Greek preacher John Chrysostom who envisioned the resurrected
Christ laughing at the Devil.
   ``Hell was angered when it encountered thee (Christ) in the
lower regions...for it was mocked (ridiculed with laughter),''
Chrysostom said.
   An old adage has it that the Devil can't stand the sound of
laughter, and slinks away from it.
   Monsignor Arthur Tonne of Marion, Kan., a Roman Catholic priest
of 83 and author of five volumes of ``Jokes Priests Can Tell,''
says several Catholic orders have observed Monday as a day of fun.
   The Rev. Francis Weiser in ``The Easter Book,'' writes that in
early Christianty ``all of Easter Week was one continuous feast''
and Easter Monday remains a legal holiday in most European
countries.
   He says in medieval times, Easter Monday was a time of ``special
festivities,'' of ``Emmaus walks'' into the woods and fields for
pinics, folk dancing, singing and games.
   One sport was was called ``drenching,'' a good-natured game in
which boys and girls in outlandish costumes doused each other or
their families with buckets or bottles of water, reciting playful
ditties.
   A Protestant custom in England was ``heaving.'' Groups of men
carrying a chair aloft would go from house to house, getting a lady
to sit in the chair, then lifting her three times, shouting
hurrahs, demanding forfeit of a kiss.
   During this ``Holy Humor Month,'' the fellowship urges divided
Christians to be, in the word's of the apostle Paul, ``fools for
Christ,'' to see the follies of their divisions and work for
Christian unity.
   That was what Jesus prayed for on the night before his
crucifixion that led to his resurrection _ that ``all may be one so
that the world may believe.''

   At the sound of the knock, a young
mutt named Roody padded over to the door to look, then walked back
into the kitchen and pawed at Cary Voorhees to get her attention.
   ``Good girl, Roody,'' Ms. Voorhees said, enthusiastically
petting the dog as it led her to the door.
   Roody, a 10-month-old stray with the spots of an Australian
shepherd, was undergoing training at Dogs for the Deaf, the oldest
training center in the country for hearing-ear dogs.
   Dogs for the Deaf was founded 10 years ago on a former dairy
farm near this rustic southern Oregon town. Each graduate earns an
orange collar and leash and become the ears for a deaf person who
has been waiting as long as a year.
   ``We have people tell us after they get a dog that they never
realized how many people came over and they just didn't hear them
at the door,'' said Robin Dickson, who took over running Dogs for
the Deaf after the death of her father, Roy Kabat, the founder.
   A smart dog led Kabat to start Dogs for the Deaf, his daughter
explained.
   ``There was a deaf lady in Minnesota,'' she said. ``She had a
dog that had trained itself to let her know when there was a sound.
   ``The dog got hit and killed by a car. She went to her
audiologist and said, `You've got to get me another dog.'
   ``He contacted the American Humane Society in Denver, and they
called my dad in. He had worked for many years training dogs for
movies in Southern California and was retired. He became so
intrigued by it that he came back here and started Dogs for the
Deaf.''
   Pins in a map on the office wall show that the 300 dogs placed
by Dogs for the Deaf are spread from coast to coast, with heavy
concentrations in the big cities.
   ``We very carefully screen the applicants,'' Mrs. Dickson said.
``If you can hear a smoke alarm go off, you don't need a dog.''
   Deaf people who have someone at home who can hear are ineligible.
   ``They also have to be able to physically and financially care
for a dog once they get it,'' Mrs. Dickson said. ``Sometimes we can
arrange a sponsor for a dog if a person can't afford it.''
   The four trainers go to Humane Society shelters around Oregon
and Northern California to find small to medium-sized dogs that are
playful, alert and comfortable around people. ``If you had a great
big Great Dane jumping up on you to let you know the phone was
ringing, that wouldn't be so good,'' Mrs. Dickson said.
   The dogs mostly are mutts.
   ``So many purebreds are so inbred that their disposition and
temperament are destroyed,'' Mrs. Dickson said.
   About half of the dogs flunk out before their three to six
months of training is done, trainer Doreen James said.
   ``Stubbornness is one of the major reasons,'' she said. ``That
doesn't show up for one to three months. It's lots of fun for them
until they realize they have to do it all the time.''
   In a one-bedroom apartment built in the loft of the old dairy
barn, the dogs learn to respond to a telephone, a knock at the
door, a smoke alarm, an oven buzzer and a baby's cry.
   Trainers also take the dogs to nearby Grants Pass and Medford to
get used to the bustle of stores, being around people and riding in
cars.
   The dogs are rewarded by praise, attention and play.
   ``You have to be really up,'' Ms. Voorhees said. ``Some dogs
take a week to learn to put their paws on the table.''
   Once the dog is ready, the trainer takes it to the recipient,
spending five days there while they get used to each other.
   A fully trained dog represents an investment of $3,000, which is
covered by contributions from supporters of the program.
   ``We get more people who send us donations to help the dogs than
to help the deaf people,'' Mrs. Dickson said. ``We help save the
unwanted dogs, so they want to help us.''
   Dogs are by no means the only aids for the deaf, who nowadays
can choose from an array of mechanical devices, including smoke
alarms with intense flashing lights, alarm clocks that flash or
make the bed shake, and bracelets that vibrate at the sound of a
baby crying.
   Demand is also growing for telecommunications devices for the
deaf, keyboards known as TDDs that plug into the phone to allow
people to type messages to each other, and decoders for
closed-caption television.
   ``It's a very big market, and it's growing rapidly,'' said
Debbie Ander, vice president of marketing for COMPU-TTY, a national
distributer for aids for the deaf based in Fort Worth, Texas.
   Anita Farb, administrative assistant for the National
Association of the Deaf in Silver Spring, Md., said the 16 million
Americans with hearing problems are demanding more as they become
aware of what is available.
   The demand for hearing-ear dogs is steadily growing, Mrs.
Dickson said.
   To meet the demand, Dogs for the Deaf is moving to bigger
quarters in Central Point, where there will be kennels for 60 dogs
instead of 25, and four training apartments instead of one.
   ``The dogs give unconditional love,'' Mrs. Dickson said. ``To a
lot of deaf people, this is the most important thing, because they
lead such isolated lives.''

<HEAD>Staying Tuned to Radio Free Europe on Polish State Radio</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A curious new program is going out over
Poland's state radio every Monday morning.
   It's called ``The West Speaks,'' and it is composed entirely of
excerpts of Polish-language broadcasts by Radio Free Europe, the
Voice of America, the British Broadcasting Corp. and other Western
radio stations.
   The segments are broadcast without comment or counterpoint, but
since the program went on the air the Polish media and officials
have criticized the Western broadcasts with greater frequency.
   The Western stations always have been characterized here as
hostile propaganda tools, but Communist government says ``The West
Speaks'' is one way to counter the influence of the broadcasts that
deliver a mixture of uncensored news, features and commentary.
   Poland stopped the electronic jamming of Western broadcasts Jan.
1 and Poles now can freely tune in to them.
   But government authorities have been raising the question of
their fairness with Western officials, including the director of
the U.S. Information Agency, Charles Z. Wick, who was here on a
visit in March.
   The authorities say that in the struggle for the hearts and
minds of the Polish people, they cannot afford to overlook the
influence of the Western stations.
   ``It doesn't matter how many people listen to it when it is
something very dangerous,'' government spokesman Jerzy Urban said
in an interview. ``Even if it's only 100 people, that is enough,
because the report will spread.''
   At one time, particularly during the Cold War years in the
1950s, it was a crime to listen to the Western stations.
   Today, however, the strains of ``Yankee Doodle Dandy,'' the
sign-on tune of the Voice of America, can be heard coming from
apartments in housing blocks.
   Urban said Polish authorities believed that countering the
broadcasts with ``polemics and arguments'' was better than
continuing the jamming.
   A public opinion poll quoted by the official news agency PAP
said 80 percent of respondents approved the decision to end the
jamming, but it said the number of listeners has not risen
significantly.
   How many people actually listen remains a matter of dispute.
   According to a survey quoted by Urban, the percentage of Poles
who listen to Radio Free Europe either regularly or occasionally is
16 percent, up 2 percentage points since jamming ended. Only 3
percent, or 1.2 million out of the population of 37.5 million,
listen as often as once a week, he said.
   But the Board for International Broadcasting, the body that
oversees Radio Free Europe in Munich, West Germany, says 59 percent
of Poles listen to its broadcasts occasionally and nearly 14
percent at least once a week.
   An informal survey of half a dozen Warsaw residents indicated
that most preferred the Voice of America or the BBC to Radio Free
Europe, known as RFE, on grounds that their information was more
reliable.
   Recent RFE broadcasts were heavy with reports of demonstrations
and protests in Poland, speeches and statements by leaders of the
outlawed Solidarity trade union and accounts of opposition
activities in other countries of the Soviet bloc.
   ``The West Speaks'' was conceived ``to show what sort of
argumentation is used by these stations,'' said Witold Stankowski,
an executive of Polish Radio One.
   He said the show, which premiered in October, was given a time
slot when ``we have a pretty good audience,'' but said he could not
judge its popularity or say how long it would be continued.
   In recent months a drumbeat of commentaries have shown up on the
PAP service and in state-run newspapers disputing specific news
items on the Western stations. Urban has made denunciations of the
broadcasts almost a fixture at his weekly news conferences.
   In the interview, Urban noted that listenership tends to rise in
times of public anxiety, such as during the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear
accident in the Soviet Union.
   He claimed RFE's ``disgraceful methods'' frightened people in
its reports on Chernobyl and in its coverage of Poland's
announcement in late January of price increases totaling 42 percent
in 1988.
   ``Radio Free Europe presents the opinion that prices in fact
will go up twice as much,'' he said. ``They want to cause, and
really do cause, an increase in wage demands.''
   U.S. Ambassador John Davis defends the broadcasts.
   ``The great bulk of what goes out seems to me to be a repetition
of what already has been published in the West,'' he said. ``It is
broadcast in, sometimes with comment, and comment is fair game.''
   Wick, the USIA director who arrived in Poland on March 23 for a
series of talks with Polish officials, said the Polish side raised
objections about Radio Free Europe and the Voice of America and the
complaints were discussed ``very forthrightly.''
   Wick said the Voice of America, which is part of USIA, and Radio
Free Europe, which is privately operated but largely funded by the
U.S. government, have charters that mandate that they be
``objective and accurate.''
   ``I invited the authorities to give me specific instances when
they were not,'' he said.
   He added that editorials on Radio Free Europe and the Voice of
America are not intended to be objective, but to ``reflect the
editorial viewpoint of the United States government.''
   As such, he said, they might not be pleasing to Poland.

<HEAD>OSCAR COUNTDOWN: Best Picture</HEAD>
<HEAD>Box Office Success Doesn't Always Lead to Oscars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>

   If the Academy Awards were based on box-office
popularity, ``Fatal Attraction'' would eliminate its four opponents
and win as best picture with ease.
   If Oscars were based on media acclaim, ``Broadcast News'' no
doubt would be the winner. The funny, incisive look at how network
journalists do their jobs under constant pressure captivated most
critics, yet ``Broadcast News'' has been a disappointment at the
box office.
   Despite mediocre attendance and mixed notices, the home-stretch
favorite for best picture of 1987 is the ``The Last Emperor,'' a
mammoth epic centering on the life of Pu Yi, boy emperor of China
and later puppet ruler of Manchuria for the Japanese. Bernardo
Bertolucci was nominated for director and co-writer, but the actors
were overlooked.
   The thriller ``Fatal Attraction'' was by far the biggest
moneymaker of the year, its combination of adultery and terror
selling $150 million worth of tickets in the United States and
Canada.
   ``Fatal Attraction'' also picked up nominations for Michael
Douglas, Glenn Close and Anne Archer, as well as director Adrian
Lyne and writer James Dearden.
   Lyne, a graduate of British TV commercials, admits that he was
sold on ``Fatal Attraction'' from the time he read the script.
   ``It was a page-turner,'' he said. ``It was sent to me when I
was in France. I sat down on some steps, and two hours later I was
still on the steps, finishing it off. It was something I couldn't
put down. I thought if I could provide the visual equipment and not
screw it up, that it had a fighting chance of being as interesting
a movie.''
   Lyne signed on with producers Stanley Jaffe and Sherry Lansing
and worked with Dearden on the script. The director carries a tape
recorder while preparing a film, and he made notes of matters he
could use, such as his own son's attempt to demonstrate card tricks.
   The three leading actors of ``Broadcast News'' _ William Hurt,
Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks _ also were nominated for awards.
James L. Brooks was named as writer and producer but, astoundingly,
did not receive a nomination as director.
   ``I wanted to do a romantic comedy,'' Brooks said. ``Just
through a series of circumstances I wound up being around a number
of network news people.''
   Brooks, who once worked as a news writer for CBS News, spent
months hanging around in studios of Washington and New York for his
research. The result is a verisimilitude that has attracted the
praise of many network news people, including the curmudgeonly Andy
Rooney.
   Bertolucci amazed the film world by winning permission to film a
movie with political overtones within China. More amazingly, he was
able to shoot inside the fabled Forbidden City, the shrine of
Chinese history.
   ``The fact that this movie exists is another proof that China is
changing,'' the Italian director said. ``Only eight years ago it
was inconceivable for the Chinese to let a Western filmmaker do a
scene about the Red Guards, as at the end of the movie when you see
the Cultural Revolution.''
   Nominee ``Hope and Glory'' is John Boorman's valentine to his
boyhood during the Battle of Britain. The writer-director-producer
won triple nominations, but his actors received none. The movie's
box-office performance has been less than impressive.
   Despite the background of German bombings, the film is primarily
comedic.
   ``For me as a child, the experience of the war was largely one
of exhilaration, joy and fun,'' Boorman said. ``This is what the
film is; it's great entertainment, it's very funny. There were
moments of horror, when people were killed. As a child, you forget
this very quickly.''
   Also up for best film of the year is ``Moonstruck,'' a romantic
comedy about an excitable Italian family in Brooklyn. Cher, Vincent
Gardenia and Olympia Dukakis are acting nominees, as well as
director Norman Jewison and writer John Patrick Shanley.
   ``Moonstruck'' has been a major success at the box office, doing
more than $50 million in business so far.
   After a pair of heavy dramas, ``A Soldier's Story'' and ``Agnes
of God,'' Jewison ``was in the mood for a romantic comedy.'' His
first choice to play Loretta, the widow torn between two lovers,
was Cher.
   ``For me, there has always been something `streety' about Cher,
a lacking in pretension,'' the Canadian director said. ``She's a
very honest person _ in-person and on the screen. She looks
Italian, although she's part Armenian and part Cherokee.''
   Yet directors don't always get their first choice for lead
performers, as was the case with ``Fatal Attraction.'' As right as
Glenn Close might seem for the role of the jilted Alix, director
Lyne said Isabelle Adjani was actually his first choice, since she
had played a similar role in a French film.
   ``But after a few months of casting _ I like to see everyone I
can _ I thought it would be more effective to go with someone who
was not obviously sensual from the outset,'' he said.
   ``Glenn Close pursued the movie and was prepared to come in and
test, which was unusual for a star. When I saw her testing with
Michael (Douglas), it was already decided on.''
   Lyne had once worked with Douglas as producer on ``Starman,''
which he ended up not directing.
   ``I had seen Michael almost every day for a year, and I saw him
as a man who was infinitely charming to both men and women but was
also very vulnerable,'' Lyne said. ``I had never seen that in
movies he had done. I had always seen more of his father _ the
heroic, the macho qualities.''

   Doubts about Ritalin, a drug used to help
hyperactive children concentrate, have drawn the attention of
lawyers and reporters and prompted some parents to halt treatment.
But The Associated Press has found the firestorm is being fanned by
a group with ties to the Church of Scientology and a history of
opposition to psychiatry. In the first story of a three-day series,
`R' Is for Ritalin, the AP examines the group's role in the Ritalin
furor.

   Twelve-page pink pamphlets are being handed
out on street corners across the country, sounding frightening
alarms in bold-face type about Ritalin, a prescription drug used
for three decades to calm hyperactive children.
   WARNING: Ritalin can lead to suicide.
   WARNING: Ritalin can be addictive.
   WARNING: Ritalin overdose can cause death.
   In newspaper stories, on talk shows, at medical conventions,
news conferences and neighborhood meetings, the group behind the
pamphlets makes other claims _ that Ritalin is as dangerous as
cocaine, causes delinquency and crime, is given to 80 percent of
children in some Maryland schools, even that psychiatrists advocate
putting it in school drinking water supplies.
   Researchers and government regulators looking into the
legitimate worries about misuse or over-prescription of Ritalin
ridicule these ``facts'' as distortions and exaggerations of their
work. Because the claims are constantly recycled without
qualification or context, they say, parents are panicking
unnecessarily.
   ``Ritalin is a safe, effective drug. I don't know of any major
problems with it,'' said Dr. Paul Leber, director of
neuropharmacological products at the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration.
   The anti-Ritalin campaign is run from a sparsely furnished
second-story office here decorated with pictures of L. Ron Hubbard,
founder of the Church of Scientology, and staffed by people wearing
``Psychiatry Kills'' sweatshirts.
   It is the headquarters of the Citizens Commission on Human
Rights, a 19-year-old organization sponsored by the Scientologists,
the contentious religious group based just down the street.
   The campaign, complete with toll-free hotline, has made CCHR's
president, Dennis Clarke, a 41-year-old member of the Scientology
church, perhaps the most quoted Ritalin expert in the country.
   It has taken the group coast to coast whenever a Ritalin case
catches public attention, be it a trial in Massachusetts,
conferences in Minnesota and Texas, or the filing of at least 13
lawsuits.
   ``Ritalin acts as a chemical straitjacket,'' Clarke said in an
interview with The Associated Press, repeating an oft-quoted claim.
``We are not dealing with a lightweight drug, but parents are told
it's like vitamins.''
   What is not always clear in CCHR-supplied information is the
group's ties to the Scientologists and that church's predisposition
against the mental health profession. Since its inception in 1969,
CCHR has attacked psychiatry, centering on treatments such as
electric shock and drugs.
   Its latest goal, Clarke said, is to use lawsuits to bring about
a ban on Ritalin, which he calls ``one of the most dangerous and
addictive substances known to man.''
   This fervor, medical experts say, is slanting the debate on
Ritalin use.
   ``It's been wild, absolutely wild, really bizarre,'' said Dr.
Jerry Wiener, president of the American Academy of Child and
Adolescent Psychiatry. ``Something calls itself the Citizens
Commission on Human Rights and all of a sudden it gets a lot of
credibility, and they're being quoted without any kind of
substantiation.''
   Ritalin has enjoyed success in treating children with a
condition now widely known as attention deficit disorder. It reacts
chemically to help calm their fidgeting, ease their impulsive,
sometimes destructive behavior, and focus their attention so they
do better in school.
   Yet no one denies that Ritalin, a drug classified with
amphetamines, must be used carefully. Although its acknowledged
side effects are mostly mild and passing, doctors say children
taking the drug must be closely monitored and counseled. And some
share worries with CCHR that Ritalin is being improperly urged on
parents by teachers and schools.
   Its sharply increased use is indicated by the number of
prescriptions filled, which rose 14 percent from 1983 to 1986;
prescriptions for most drugs increase about 1 percent a year,
according to federal statistics.
   ``I have a concern about overuse and abuse where the drug is
used alone,'' Wiener said. ``When any drug begins to be known as
effective, you have to be careful about overuse _ like Valium and
Librium.''
   In the rush to reexamine Ritalin's role, much press attention
has focused on the lawsuits filed on behalf of distressed parents.
   But most stories fail to note that of the 13 suits in
California, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Georgia and the District of
Columbia, one is being handled by CCHR's counsel and the others
were filed by two lawyers who get Ritalin data _ and sometimes
clients _ through CCHR.
   ``They are very efficient and a wealth of information,'' said
one of those lawyers, John Coale, who has represented victims of
the Bhopal, India, cyanide gas disaster and the DuPont Plaza Hotel
fire in Puerto Rico.
   Some of the suits accuse not only pediatricians or psychiatrists
of wrongdoing, but also teachers and school districts involved in
children's treatment.
   ``The only thing that will turn this around is the same thing
that turned around exploding Pintos and Thalidomide _ and that's
major, major multi-million-dollar lawsuits,'' Clarke said.
``Unfortunately, that means suing schools as well as
psychiatrists.''
   At the heart of the Ritalin dispute are the claims and data used
by CCHR. Among its questioned statements:
   _ Clarke often says 4 million American children are taking
Ritalin, four times as many as estimated by the most liberal
researchers. When asked for his source, Clarke cited a specific
newspaper story. When it was pointed out that the article makes no
mention of 4 million children, Clarke replied, ``I don't know how
many. I just know it's too many.''
   _ Clarke frequently asserts that 80 percent of the students in a
Maryland school system are taking Ritalin. Asked to identify the
system, he amended his assertion to just one school and said the
information came from an attorney who handles Ritalin suits. Asked
about the attorney's sources, Clarke cited an unidentified parent
told by an unidentified neurologist.
   Clarke said he repeats the 80 percent figure because he believes
it's true. ``There's enough of it there (in Maryland) to have them
all on it,'' he said.
   _ Clarke says Ritalin may have caused a 600-percent increase in
child suicide over five years. He cites medical manual warnings
that suicide is a complication of withdrawal from drugs such as
Ritalin. But doctors say the danger is minimal when the drug is
used properly.
   ``I have children who go off of it every weekend,'' said Dr.
Ralph S. Smith Jr., a Charleston, W.Va., child psychiatrist. ``I
have children who go off every summer because they only need it
during school.'' Nevertheless, Smith said, three of his ADD
patients stopped taking Ritalin after their parents read an article
highlighting CCHR claims.
   _ CCHR refers to a California study which, Clarke asserts, shows
children treated with Ritalin commit more felonies later in life.
The study's author, Dr. James Satterfield, says that is a complete
misreading.
   Satterfield, a psychiatrist and director of the National Center
for Hyperactive Children in Encino, Calif., and his wife,
psychologist Breena Satterfield, studied 130 hyperactive boys, all
of whom received Ritalin and 50 of whom also received therapy and
behavioral advice.
   In general, hyperactive children exhibit higher than normal
rates of misbehavior and delinquency, but the boys who received
therapy as well as Ritalin had lower levels of delinquency.
   ``While it is true that Ritalin by itself has not been found to
prevent delinquency,'' Satterfield said, ``it most certainly has
never been found to cause delinquency.''

   In a report to Congress last year, agencies including the
National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration,
the National Institute of Mental Health and the Centers for Disease
Control said ``the side effects are minimal'' for children treated
with Ritalin.
   Ritalin's manufacturer, Ciba-Geigy Corp., is straightforward
about the side effects, which include nervousness, insomnia,
rashes, anorexia, nausea, headaches and weight loss. Some evidence
suggests it can temporarily retard growth.
   Ciba-Geigy also cautions about its use by emotionally unstable
patients and the possibility of severe depression in unsupervised
withdrawal from the drug.
   Clarke complains these warnings don't reach parents and further
asserts that psychiatrists have used drugs to create a
self-perpetuating industry. Those who dispute him, he adds, are
trying to protect their business.
   ``These are the baby-druggers,'' Clarke said. ``I believe I'm
pretty conservative with my information. ... The whole thing does
not exist because of Scientology. The problem exists because
children are being harmed.''
   Clarke defends his allegations, saying they are based on medical
literature, and contends doctors who prescribe Ritalin aren't
acknowledging its dangers.
   Psychiatrists, however, say CCHR attacks them because of their
basic philosophical difference with the Church of Scientology,
which does not recognize mental illness as a physiological problem.
   Scientology, founded by science fiction writer Hubbard in 1954,
is based on a theory called ``Dianetics'' which says physical and
mental problems can be solved by using an ``E-meter,'' an electric
device set up much like a lie detector. Members are assigned
exercises and counseling to eliminate negative mental images and
achieve a ``clear state.''
   The church supports CCHR, Clarke said, because the group is
``part of the basic philosophy _ things having to do with the
spiritual nature of man. You don't deal with the spirit by
lobotomizing someone or using electric shock. It's not only bad
science, it's harmful for the being.''
   Clarke is a convincing speaker with a seemingly endless catalog
of Ritalin horror stories. He left a successful solar heating
business in Hawaii in 1985 to run CCHR, and travels constantly,
using local issues as a platform for his crusade.
   Just before 15-year-old Rod Matthews, an emotionally troubled
youth who used Ritalin, was tried for the murder of classmate Shaun
Ouillette, 14, in Canton, Mass., Clarke appeared on local talk
shows. After the trial, he held a news conference to announce more
lawsuits.
   Last year, the local CCHR chapter staged a demonstration in
Canton. The victim's mother, Jeanne Quinn, said a couple holding a
sign reading ``Ritalin Killed Shaun, Not Rod'' came to her door,
asked for her and offered pamphlets on the dangers of Ritalin.
   Matthews' defense included claims that Ritalin worsened his
severe mental problems. The jury found him sane and convicted him
of second-degree murder. He was sentenced to life in prison,
eligible for parole after 15 years.
   Ironically, the victim had taken Ritalin for four years,
successfully conquering his hyperactivity.
   ``They look for cases like this and grab onto it for their own
purposes,'' Mrs. Quinn said of CCHR. ``I have little respect for
any of their opinions. They take small quotations and excerpts from
medical books and give you their opinion. Everything is out of
context.''
   When the University of Minnesota held a conference on ADD last
summer, CCHR members staged rallies, hung signs on expressway
overpasses, announced a Ritalin lawsuit and staged a rock concert
for a ``Drug Free America.''
   ``The following week my practice received roughly 40 phone calls
from parents concerned about the medication,'' said Dr. Jeffrey
Alexander, a pediatrician at Minneapolis' Park Nicollet Medical
Center who has about 200 patients on Ritalin. Three or four
actually discontinued treatment, he said.
   Experts like the Satterfields say that while they are concerned
that Ritalin needs to be used properly, they worry that because
CCHR is trading on parents' fears, children not getting treatment
they need.
   ``It's unfortunate that these children become the victims of
special interest groups instead of being looked at for their
individual requirements,'' said Mrs. Satterfield. ``Fear doesn't
contribute to good treatment of children and good medical
practices.''

   To calm hyperactive children, doctors give them a
stimulant.
   The seemingly contradictory effects of stimulants on hyperactive
youngsters have been known since the 1930s. When used carefully,
most experts agree, they are safe and effective.
   The most commonly prescribed of these medicines is a mild
central nervous system stimulant called Ritalin. The drug, known
generically as methylphenidate, was first sold in 1955 to improve
mental performance in the elderly and reduce fatigue.
   Now it is the mainstay of treatment for attention deficit
disorder in children, which parents usually recognize by its most
common and distressing symptom, hyperactivity.
   Experts say as many as 80 percent of ADD youngsters may be
helped by drug treatment, but the extent of their improvement
varies.
   ``Thirty percent of the kids who have attention deficit disorder
do so well on the drug that the parents want to kiss you on both
cheeks,'' said Dr. Jonathan Cole of McLean Hospital, a
Harvard-affiliated mental hospital in Belmont, Mass. ``Other kids
are sort of better or not really better at all.'' The underlying
cause of the disorder and the reason stimulants calm children and
help them concentrate are still mysteries.
   Genes play some role. Studies show one-third of all youngsters
with ADD have parents with the ailment. About half the youngsters
with ADD outgrow the problem by adolescence; the rest carry it into
adulthood.
   ``This drug has been around for 50 years and marketed for 30,''
said Dr. Ron Kartzinel of Ciba-Geigy, the company that makes
Ritalin. ``We really cannot fully explain, biochemically or
physiologically, how the drug works in attention deficit disorder.
There are many theories, but they are just that _ theories.''
   Other drugs used to treat the disorder are Cylert, or pemoline,
and Dexedrine, or dextroamphetamine. All of them stimulate the
brain to produce chemical messengers that brain cells use to alert
and stimulate their neighbors. Experts believe this increase in
brain chemicals has something to do with the drugs' beneficial
effects.
   The drugs do carry side effects, but most are mild and passing.
Some youngsters lose their appetites and have trouble falling
asleep for the first week or two they take Ritalin.
   Ritalin can also slow youngsters' growth. Dr. David Zametkin of
the National Institute of Mental Health said doctors should monitor
patients' height and weight. If growth slows, they should take them
off the drug temporarily, during summer vacation, for example. The
youngsters then have a growth spurt and catch up.
   Another, but extremely rare, side effect is tics and twitches.
Zametkin said that when the drugs are stopped, these problems
almost always go away.
   At Ciba-Geigy, Kartzinel said that over the last 16 years, the
company has received 17 reports of slowed growth and 10 reports of
tics associated with Ritalin.
   A few years ago, doctors feared that Ritalin caused Tourette's
syndrome, a disorder in which people make involuntary movements and
noises. However, Zametkin said it now appears Tourette's syndrome
itself is often preceded by symptoms that resemble those for ADD.
   Some youngsters who are treated with Ritalin for ADD
subsequently develop Tourette's syndrome, he said, but this would
have happened anyway, regardless of whether they got the drug.
   Zametkin said the stimulants do not, as some parents fear, make
children high or euphoric. Instead, if they take too much, they
tend to become moody and irritable.
   ``If you know anybody who ever took Dexedrine to stay up and
study, they got some of the same effects as these kids _ improved
concentration, decreased distractability and less fatigue,'' said
Cole. ``It's sort of like super-coffee, although it makes you feel

<HEAD>In a Dozen States, Robertson Supporters Bid to Take Over GOP</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Pat Robertson's presidential candidacy may have ground to a halt
but his famed ``invisible army'' is still on the march, threatening
in some places to take over the Republican Party, planting the
seeds for a Robertson resurgence in 1992.
   Battles already fought or being waged this spring could leave
the party machinery in part or entirely under the command of forces
loyal to the former television evangelist in such states as
Georgia, Oklahoma, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia,
Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Iowa, Nevada, Hawaii and Alaska.
   That will make things easier for Robertson if he chooses, as he
has hinted he will, to run again for the Republican presidential
nomination in four years _ even if it means challenging an
incumbent Republican.
   The Robertson campaign hit the wall in the South on Super
Tuesday, and the candidate has conceded that George Bush will win
the GOP nomination, but his people are not giving up. They are
still winning skirmishes across the map, in places where a
precinct's party machinery can be seized merely by turning out a
handful of loyalists to the cause.
   ``We in the evangelical right are here to stay,'' said Robertson
activist Tom Vestal, pastor of the Mount Olivet Baptist Church in
Raleigh, N.C., where supporters of Robertson and George Bush may
wind up in court in a fight over the composition of the state's
delegation to this summer's Republican national convention.
   ``We're not trying to take over the party but we want to be an
influence, to ensure that the party is an instrument of godliness,
righteousness and morality,'' Vestal said.
   Robertson talks of his people running for Congress and state
legislatures in 1990, and of using his troops ``to maybe lay the
foundations for something in 1992.''
   ``We have hundreds of thousands of people who are right now in
the Republican Party who have never been there before and they all,
almost to a man, are saying, `We're in it for the long haul,'''
Robertson said in an interview.
   In many places in the South, a minority Republican Party, eager
for new blood, hungrily accommodated the influx of Robertson
people. Ideologically, the newcomers and the old timers think
alike; differences are more likely to be over style and personality.
   But that doesn't rule out frictions.
   ``They don't want participation, they want domination,''
grumbled state legislator Harry R. ``Bob'' Purkey, who was ousted
in 1986 as district Republican chairman by a religious school
principal in Robertson's back yard, Virginia Beach, Va.
   This year, at a district convention in Newport News, Va.,
long-time party stalwarts also were thrown out by Robertson
supporters.
   Said Anne Kincaid, head of the Virginia chapter of Americans for
Robertson: ``We will do whatever it takes, ethically and within the
rules, to get Pat nominated.''
   Terry Wade, chief of staff at the Republican National Committee
in Washington, said the new blood energizes the party.
   He called the Robertson challenges a weak echo of the party
takeover by Barry Goldwater's people in 1964. Nor does it have
anything like the magnitude of Ronald Reagan's putsch in many
places in 1976 which led to his winning the nomination four years
later.
   ``If our party were to become perceived as a single issue party
or one having a very narrow viewpoint of America, that would be a
problem, but I don't see that happening,'' Wade said.
   ``There's always going to be some dissatisfaction and disruption
when new people move in, but, hey, if we're going to become the
majority party, we have to grow.''
   Checks by Associated Press reporters around the country found
instances in which Robertson forces fit right in _ and instances in
which they didn't.
   There were old guard complaints that the Robertson people are
not interested in day-to-day party work and complaints from
Robertson people that the regulars preferred the comforts of
clubbiness to winning elections.
   In Michigan, a year and a half of chaotic battle, in and out of
court, battered the Republican Party and put Robertson forces in
the majority in the state central committee. The likely result:
competing Bush and Robertson delegations demanding to be seated at
the national convention in New Orleans in August, touching off a
nasty credentials fight pitting Bush forces against Robertson.

<HEAD>UNDATED: against Robertson.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In Hawaii, where Robertson swept party caucuses Feb. 4, GOP
chairman Howard Chong was ousted by a Robertson supporter, losing
his chance to attend the party's state convention as a delegate.
   Chong first pledged to unite the warring factions, but later
called a news conference to denounce the ``lies and innuendoes'' of
Robertson people and announced: ``Frankly speaking, I have had
enough.''
   Under the rules, Bush won all 48 delegates in Georgia, but when
the state's delegates are selected as many as half are expected to
go Robertson people. They will be bound to Bush for two ballots at
the national convention, but free to vote with Robertson on
platform issues, credentials challenges and party rules.
   ``It is our aim to see that the party is broadened,'' said
attorney Don Johnson of Marietta, Ga., a Robertson supporter.
``...We're either going to broaden it with them or broaden it over
them.''
   Bob Bell, former state GOP chairman, said, however: ``Nothing in
their numbers would lead me to believe this group can take over the
party.''
   Robertson supporters dominated many precinct meetings and county
conventions in Oklahoma. One likely result, says Matt Seward,
Bush's state director: the Oklahomans will support a plank
denouncing the arms control treaty coming before the Senate for
ratification even though Bush vigorously supports it.
   Bush swept the 111 national delegates available from his adopted
state of Texas, but Robertson forces, based on their showings in
county conventions in March, think they have a chance to elect
their own candidate as state GOP chairman in Houston in June. Some
Texas counties will send delegations that are 100 percent Robertson
people.
   ``If the new Robertson-type people will filter out some of the
biblical language and keep their principles, they can realize more
of their goals,'' commented retiring Texas chairman George Strake,
a former Democrat who converted to Republicanism in 1961 ``because
I thought Republicans were firmer against communism.''
   Nevada, reflecting the outcome of February's caucuses, will send
a pro-Robertson delegation to the national convention. Robertson's
state director, Steve Wark, said the Nevadans will be in no mood to
jump aboard a Bush bandwagon. Such a conciliatory move, he said,
would be ``poisonous.''
   In Washington state, the only Super Tuesday state that went for
Robertson, GOP executive director John Meyers was asked if he saw
the Robertson crowd as heirs to the Reagan Revolution. He replied:
``I see it as an extension of the Goldwater Revolution.'' Anti-gay,
anti-United Nations, pro-school prayer conservatives have run the
state party for decades, even though Sen. Dan Evans, R-Wash., is
characterized as moderate-to-liberal.
   In Maine, when Robertson people threatened to take over in
February, forces supporting Bush and Bob Dole buried their
differences to vote them down and prevent the selection of a
pro-Robertson delegation to New Orleans.
   Robertson coordinator John Solberg cried foul. ``The Bush and
Dole campaigns are attempting to keep the majority silent in the
democratic process,'' he complained. Gov. John R. McKernan Jr., a
Bush man, brushed off the charge. ``This is not fun and games,'' he
said. ``We're talking about the next president of the United
States.''

   Congress unconstitutionally singled out
publisher Rupert Murdoch by prohibiting his continued ownership of
newspapers and television stations in the same city, an appeals
court says.
   A recently enacted provision barring the Federal Communications
Commission from extending temporary waivers from its
cross-ownership rule is unconstitutional because it ``strikes at
Murdoch with the precision of a laser beam'' without a legitimate
purpose, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington ruled
Tuesday in a 2-1 opinion.
   Murdoch recently sold the New York Post so he could keep a New
York television station in compliance with the law, and faces a
similar choice in Boston.

   Profit-taking by futures investors has snapped a
four-day rally in oil prices.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange Tuesday, contracts for May
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil,
settled at $16.98 per 42-gallon barrel, down 12 cents from Monday's
close. All other contract months also lost 12 cents a barrel.
   Among refined oil products, the April contract for wholesale
heating oil edged down 0.02 cent a gallon to 48.15 cents. Unleaded
gasoline for April rose, on the other hand, by 0.24 cent a gallon
to 48.26 cents.
   Analysts noted that the decline was moderate and prices moved
within narrow trading ranges. The selling was led by oil companies,
they said.
   Prices are ``still showing a fair amount of resiliency,'' said
John Azarow, an oil futures trader for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The recent strength stems from hopes that the pricing committee
of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
achieve an agreement to prop up prices, analysts say. Prices have
risen in eight of the last 11 trading sessions on the Mercantile
Exchange.
   The OPEC pricing panel has announced it will hold a meeting in
Vienna, Austria, starting April 9. The five pricing committee
members are Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Indonesia, Algeria and Venezuela.
   On the negative side, Middle East Economic Survey, an oil
industry newsletter, said some observers believe OPEC production
has risen to about 18 million barrels a day.
   The newsletter said demand for OPEC crude, even taking into
account some stockpiling, is unlikely to top 17 million barrels a
day.

<HEAD>Kohlberg Kravis Seeking Larger Texaco Stake</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN C. GIVEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Texaco Inc. prepares to emerge from
bankruptcy court protection next month, a welcoming party of
takeover specialists continues to grow outside the oil giant's door.
   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., which has carried out some of the
largest leveraged buyouts in U.S. history, said Tuesday it is
seeking federal permission to buy up to 15 percent of Texaco Inc.'s
stock.
   The investment banking firm, often a management ally in its
deals, said it had already acquired 11.95 million Texaco shares, or
about 4.9 percent of Texaco's roughly 242 million outstanding
shares.
   In filing to enlarge that stake, Kohlberg Kravis would join
financiers Carl C. Icahn and T. Boone Pickens in announcing
interest or taking substantial stakes in the nation's third-largest
oil company.
   Getty Petroleum Co., a product of Texaco's ill-fated 1984
acquisition of Getty Oil Co., has also filed for the same federal
permission to up its stake in Texaco.
   Industry analysts viewed the latest development as another
indication of the stiff challenge that Texaco's management will
face as it attempts to hang on to control over the company while
conducting an orderly reorganization beginning next month.
   ``Big shark, little shark, they all bite,'' observed Frank P.
Knuettel, who tracks oil companies at Prudential Bache Securities.
   For its part, Texaco took the high road in its response.
   ``Kohlberg Kravis Roberts has in past situations demonstrated an
ability to be a constructive shareholder, which recognizes the
importance of building value for the long term. We have no
indication that their intentions with Texaco are any different,''
the company said in a statement from its White Plains, N.Y.,
headquarters.
   ``We are hopeful that (it) will play a constructive role as
Texaco pursues prompt and aggressives steps to restructure the
company and maximize total value and return for all our
shareholders.''
   Investors responded enthusiastically to Kohlberg Kravis's
announcement. In nationwide trading of New York Stock
Exchange-listed issues, Texaco jumped $3.25 a share to $48.
   Kohlberg Kravis said it had purchased its shares ``some months
ago in the open market.'' Ruth Pachman, of the public relations
firm Kekst and Co., which was representing the firm, said there
would be no further comment.
   But a source close to the investment company said the filing
would permit it to ``initiate discussions'' with Texaco's
management. The source would not elaborate.
   Kohlberg Kravis is a leader in leveraged buyouts, in which
investors pay off the debt from a corporate takeover with the cash
flow of the target company or by selling some or all of its assets.
   Its $6.1 billion buyout of Beatrice Cos., completed in April
1986, was the largest leveraged buyout ever carried out in this
country. Seven months later, the firm bought Safeway Stores for
about $4.2 billion.
   Texaco last week received U.S. Bankruptcy Court permission to
emerge from Chapter 11 protection from its creditors with a
financial reorganization plan that will become official on April 7.
   As part of that plan it has said it will sell at least $3
billion in assets.
   But analysts, who estimate the company to be worth between $50
and $60 per share, if it were broken up and sold off in pieces,
have been expecting some outside move to accelerate those sales to
raise the shares' value.
   Icahn _ Texaco's largest shareholder with 14.8 percent of its
shares _ has been aggressively critical of Texaco's management and
has been widely expected to lead the charge on the company.
   On Tuesday, he said he was ``surprised but also pleased'' to
learn of the Kohlberg Kravis move.
   Icahn has promised to field a slate of five candidates _
including himself _ for five board seats up for election at the
company's annual meeting this spring, if Texaco does not put itself
up for sale. Texaco officials have vowed repeatedly not to do that.
   Pickens has received federal regulatory permission to buy up to
15 percent of Texaco's shares. He has said he would support the
Icahn slate. On Tuesday, however, David Bachelder, president of
Pickens' Mesa Limited Partnership would not say how many Texaco
shares Pickens has actually accumulated.
   Getty Petroleum Co., an independent marketer of petroleum
products, has made a similar filing, claiming, however, that it is
``for investment only.''
   Philip L. Dodge, an analyst at Nomura Securities International
Inc., said that ``the remaining question is whether the Texaco
management remains in charge of the company.''
   Alluding to the growing pressure on Texaco, he suggested that
``provisions could be made'' for its management to participate in a
leveraged buyout.
   ``I don't think they'd do it with much appetite, but (they
would) if they saw it as the lesser of two evils,'' he added.

<HEAD>CBS Offers Early Retirement Incentives to Older Employees</HEAD>
<HEAD>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</HEAD>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS Inc. says its special offer of increased
pension benefits to about 11 percent of its employees who agree to
retire within four months would help it slim down and compete in
the tough broadcasting business.
   But one securities analyst said such offers have typically cost
companies some of their better workers and could hurt CBS in the
long run.
   ``These things have tended to give the best people a reason to
leave and the worst people a reason not to,'' said Alan Gottesman,
who follows media companies for the investment firm L.F. Rothschild
& Co.
   On Wall Street, CBS rose 62{ cents a share to $158.75 in trading
on the New York Stock Exchange.
   CBS disclosed Tuesday that it was offering the option to about
800 of the company's 7,000 workers and was described as part of the
company's continuing effort to streamline operations to be
competitive.
   A company spokeswoman, Alice Henderson, said the company had set
no goal for how many people it hoped would take advantage of the
program.
   ``The program is completely voluntary and eligible employees
have until July 1 to make their decision on this offer,'' CBS said
in a memo to the workers who are involved. Retirement must occur no
later than July 29.
   Since Laurence A. Tisch took over as chief executive in the fall
of 1986, CBS has sold its records, magazines and book publishing
units, leaving it with a core business of broadcasting and about $3
billion in cash.
   But analysts say the CBS Television network has been
unprofitable and is likely to end the current season in last place
in prime-time audience ratings, a development that could depress
its advertising revenue.
   The special retirement program is available to CBS employees 55
years of age and older who have at least 10 years of pension
vesting credit.
   Those who accept the offer would get pension benefits calculated
as if the employee were five years older and had completed an
additional five years of service.
   ``As we all understand, CBS is still in the process of examining
ways in which we can further streamline our operations to ensure
our ability to be competitive in an increasingly competitive
market,'' the memo said.
   ``We hope that the availability of this very attractive
voluntary retirement option will assist us in reaching this
objective,'' it said.
   The company offered a similar early retirement incentive plan in
1985, and a CBS source who asked not to be identified said about
500 people took advantage of it.
   The source said the latest plan is viewed by CBS management as a
less painful way to make staff reductions than by firings.
   J. Kendrick Noble, the media analyst for the investment firm
PaineWebber, said the offer was a cost-cutting move that reflected
the corporate restructuring and the television network's dismal
ratings performance.
   ``It's not that this company is fat or anything, but it is under
more pressure than others to reduce costs,'' he said.
   Rumors have circulated _ and have been denied repeatedly by CBS
_ that Tisch may be planning to sell the television network while
holding on to its radio and television stations. Rothschild's
Gottesman said the retirement incentive is ``consistent with the
liquidation theory.''
   But John Reidy, a media analyst for the investment firm Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., said he found nothing unusual about the early
retirement offer.
   ``Tisch felt he could do things with less people ... He wants to
get an improved return on his investment. I don't see anything
cosmic in any of this,'' he said.

<HEAD>Study Shows Ways Companies Deal With Older Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Older white-collar workers face employer
attitudes ranging from accommodating to hostile, and a company's
financial health plays a part, a University of Michigan study shows.
   Corporations with money problems are most likely to be
antagonistic toward older workers, according to the study of 25
Fortune 500 companies by Barbara Hirshorn.
   She said her interviews at the 25 companies indicated factors
such as the state of the economy and the industry, corporate
personality, corporate leadership and organizational structure
shaped company attitudes.
   The study also indicated corporate attitudes can change, said
Hirshorn, a research fellow at the university's Population Studies
Center.
   Companies participating in the study were guaranteed
confidentiality.
   Hirshorn said attitudes toward older workers could be
categorized as:
   _Pro-active. These companies dealt most effectively with older
workers, offering more than one possible career ladder, maintaining
options for the company and for workers of all ages, encouraging
lateral career changes and reassigning workers to relieve stress
and boredom.
   _Performance-focused. Such companies tried to ignore age and
apply a reliable evaluation system to all employees. Hirshorn said
this tended to benefit older employees over younger ones who had to
be considered more in terms of their potential.
   _At cross-purposes. At these companies, managers might express
high regard and design some effective policies for older workers,
but retain other policies that work against them. Limited
opportunities for promotion or lateral moves and huge, sweetened
early retirement programs were examples.
   Hirshorn said some retailers have policies at cross-purposes,
voicing pride in being non-discriminatory but at the same time
assuming older employees will burn out because the business is
stressful and failing to offer them new opportunities.
   _Positive means-negative ends. These were companies where
coordinated planning efforts were subverted to get rid of older
workers. Hirshorn said such actions were often the result of new
stresses from inside or outside the organization.
   _Actively antagonistic. In a few companies, hostility showed up
in a variety of policies. ``I came across one insurance company
where age bias ran deeply throughout the ranks,'' Hirshorn said.
``Those who refused to relocate were fired, and since so few
employees over 55 were promoted, many older workers left.''
   Some companies refused to retrain older workers, citing poor
return on investment, though they did not raise the issue when
retraining workers in their 30s who are more likely to leave for
new jobs, she said.
   Hirshorn said she will study 10 of the 25 companies to determine
how they change or maintain their policies in reaction to external
and internal stresses over time.

<HEAD>Dollar Generally Higher In Sluggish Trading, Gold Eases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose against most major currencies in
sluggish European trading this morning as volume tapered off before
the Easter break. Gold prices eased.
   Dealers predicted volume would remain thin through Good Friday
and the dollar would likely trade around its present levels until
after the Easter weekend.
   The Bank of Japan intervened for the second straight day to
support the dollar, but traders in Frankfurt said the market
reacted mildly because the amount of dollars purchased by Japan's
central bank was apparently small.
   Traders said, however, the intervention served its purpose by
reviving market fears of concerted central bank intervention.
   ``There are a lot of traders around who want to sell dollars but
are afraid to do so,'' said a dealer at a major West German bank in
Frankfurt.
   Traders said the dollar gained some support from recent
statistics that indicate the U.S. economy is robust.
   ``The underlying sentiment is still certainly bearish on the
dollar, but not aggressively so,'' said one trader with a major
European commercial bank in Milan.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 1.06 yen to a closing 125.43 Japanese yen.
Later, in London, it fell back to 125.28 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.6705 West German marks, up from 1.6610; 1.3790
Swiss francs, up from 1.3735; 5.6587 French francs, up from 5.6280;
1.8764 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8690; 1,236.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,232.50; 1.2362 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2363.
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.8615 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.8705 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $454.50 a troy ounce and
at midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $454.00. Both were down from Tuesday's late
bid of $454.75.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $454.00, down from $455.00 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.09 to close at a bid of
$455.79.
   Silver bullion eased in London to a bid price of $6.675 a troy
ounce, down from $6.69 late Tuesday.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gains on overseas markets helped boost the dollar
in Tokyo today, while the stock market's key index closed at a
post-crash high.
   Trading on the foreign exchange market was quiet, with many
corporate customers staying on the sidelines until the end of
Japan's fiscal year on Thursday, dealers said.
   The dollar opened at 125.75 yen, up 1.38 yen from Tuesday's
close of 124.37 yen. It began edging down in the afternoon and
ended trading at 125.43 yen, up 1.06 yen. The U.S. currency ranged
between 125.40 and 125.78 yen, with spot volume totaling $5.3
billion.
   The gain came after the dollar had lost a total of 2.78 yen over
four trading days.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange enjoyed its third consecutive day of
healthy gains in heavy trading. The 225-stock Nikkei Average rose
366.89 points, or 1.41 percent, ending the day at 26,319.98.
   It was the first time the key index had closed above the
26,000-level since the October market crash. The closing was less
than 327 points from the index's all-time closing high of 26,646.43.
   Traders said stock prices were boosted by the stronger dollar,
gains on the New York and London markets on Tuesday, and typical
enthusiasm marking the start of the new Japanese fiscal year.
   ``Sentiment is very positive. We might see a new historical high
this week, as long as New York (Wall Street) and the yen behave,''
a trader said.
   On the foreign exchange market, traders said many participants
continued to cover dollar-short positions as they had on Tuesday,
when the dollar temporarily touched 123.87 yen, its lowest level
since the first week of January.
   They attributed the U.S. currency's higher opening today to
overnight gains on overseas markets and unconfirmed reports of
greater intervention in support of the dollar by the U.S. Federal
Reserve.
   Also adding to the U.S. currency's strength was a denial today
by Japanese insurance companies that they were planning to begin
dumping dollars after the start of the new fiscal year.
   Rumors had been circulating that the companies, a major
influence in currency markets, would discontinue their recent
support for the dollar, said to have been aimed at defending the
value of their holdings for accounting purposes.
   But many analysts said bullish sentiments toward the yen remain
in the market because of healthly Japanese economic fundamentals.

   Solid gains in Tokyo and New York overnight gave London a
modestly bullish start. But the London market failed to sustain a

   Traders reiterated that little would happen regardless of
enthusiasm elsewhere ahead of the Easter holiday and Thursday's end
to the British fiscal year.

   The Common Market's 3 percent year-on-year inflation rate in

rates of 0.9 percent in Japan and 3.9 percent in the United States.
   The 0.3 percent February rate continues the trend of moderate

   It said inflation was modest in all EEC countries except
Portugal and Denmark, which recorded monthly increases of 1.4
percent and 0.8 percent, respectively.

<HEAD>Japanese Insurers Deny Rumors They Plan To Sell Dollars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Japanese life insurance companies have
denied rumors that they plan to sell off U.S. dollars after April
1, a move that would send the currency into a tailspin.
   A new accounting law requiring life insurance companies to
report currency losses of 15 percent or more when the current
fiscal year ends March 31 has sparked speculation that the
companies would try to support the dollar at an artificially high
level and then retreat from U.S. financial markets soon after the
close of the fiscal year.
   Large-scale dollar selling here would push the U.S. currency
lower. Fears that the Japanese might dump dollars has caused
jitters in currency markets worldwide, with some traders selling
the U.S. currency as a hedge against more widespread dollar sales.
   But a statement issued Tuesday by Yasuyuki Wakahara, chairman of
the Japan Life Insurers Association, called such speculation
``absolutely groundless.'' He noted that stable exchange rates are
vital to Japanese life insurance companies, which often invest in
currencies other than the yen.
   ``This association hopes more than anyone else for a stable
yen-dollar exchange rate,'' the statement said.
   Tatsuo Nakata, an association executive, told reporters at a
news conference that dollar selling by the insurance companies
would be like ``strangling yourselves.''
   ``I think it's prudent to take the statement at face value,''
said David Gerstenhaber, senior economist with Morgan Stanley & Co.
in Tokyo, who said he would be surprised if the life insurance
companies pulled out of dollar-denominated investments in April.
   ``They have so much paper, that the value of what's left would
be lowered by the impact of small sales,'' Gerstenhaber said.
   Life insurance companies were given some leeway on the 15
percent rule when the Japanese government decided to allow the
closing dollar rate for fiscal 1987 to be the average closing in
Tokyo for all of March, not the daily closing on March 31, as some
analysts believed.
   ``The Ministry of Finance has allowed companies to use the
month's average in order to alleviate strain from the crash in
October, so people now are back above water,'' said Bruce Babcock
of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   In its statement, the Life Insurers Association also criticized
what it called growing instability caused by speculation in the
market, an indirect reference to the weakness earlier this week of
the dollar, which traded briefly Tuesday below the 124-yen level, a
three-month low. It rebounded Wednesday to close in Tokyo at 125.43
yen.

<TEXT>
   Publisher Rupert Murdoch could still have
trouble obtaining a government extension allowing him to keep both
his newspaper and television station in Boston, because both
properties are making money.
   The possibility of an extension was opened Tuesday by a federal
appeals court. The panel ruled that Congress unconstitutionally
singled out Murdoch when it barred the Federal Communications
Commission from extending temporary waivers of a rule forbidding
common ownership of newspapers and TV stations in the same city.
   Under existing FCC cross-owership rules, Murdoch would have to
show that either the Boston Herald or WFXT-TV is financially
distressed. However, both properties are making money.
   ``Unless the commission were to make some tremendous change in
the criteria for granting a waiver, he doesn't qualify and we will
oppose it,'' said Andrew Schwartzman, executive director of Media
Access Project, a Washington, D.C.-based public interest law firm.
   Diane Killory, FCC general counsel, said temporary waivers are
granted to give the owner of a newspaper-TV combination time to
sell one of the properties for a fair price and avoid forcing a
distress sale.
   ``If someone were willing to pay fair market value, it would be
tough to argue it would be a distress sale, and that's the criteria
we use when a temporary waiver is justified,'' she said.
   For a permanent waiver, an owner must show that common ownership
was necessary to keep both the newspaper and TV station afloat
financially, she said.
   Lawrence Kessler, general counsel for Murdoch's News America
Publishing Inc., acknowledged that the Herald could survive without
the TV station's revenues, but he said the company will argue that
the issue is fairness.
   ``The hardship would be if we were forced to dispose of another
asset and then the FCC modified the rule (to allow common
ownership), that would be a hardship in and of itself,'' he said.
   Kessler noted FCC precedents for granting further time for
Murdoch. The commission last year granted Capital Cities-ABC Inc.
and General Electric Co. waivers of orders to sell radio stations
while it decides whether to eliminate the cross-ownership rule
barring common ownership of radio and TV stations in the same city.
   Murdoch received temporary waivers from the FCC's
cross-ownership rule after he bought the Boston TV station and New
York station WNYW-TV in 1986. He was given until March 6 to sell
either WNYW or the New York Post, and June 30 to sell WFXT or the
Boston Herald.
   Murdoch had been widely expected to request extensions of his
waivers, but Sens. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., and Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., cut short that option. Late last year, they slipped
through Congress a measure prohibiting the FCC from extending any
outstanding waivers. The measure also forbids the agency from
considering any changes in the rule.
   In a 2-1 decision Tuesday, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Washington ruled that the law is unconstitutional because it
targeted a specific individual for no legitimate purpose.
   Though the ruling opens the possibility that Murdoch could keep
both Boston properties at least temporarily, it won't affect the
New York Post, since he sold the newspaper earlier this month for
$37 million to real estate developer Peter Kalikow.
   Murdoch and others had said the ban by Congress was an attempt
to silence his newspapers' criticism of Kennedy. Kennedy and
Hollings, however, said they were merely trying to preserve the
cross-ownership rules and force Murdoch to comply with them.
   The court did not address the section of the provision that
prevents the FCC from considering whether the cross-ownership rule
should be abolished. Therefore, that prohibition remains in effect
until Oct. 1, when the authority under the spending bill to which
the measure was attached expires.
   Kessler said Murdoch will ask the FCC to extend its waiver for
six months after the FCC makes a final decision on its
cross-ownership rule.
   Congress could forestall such a decision by continuing to
prohibit the FCC from considering the issue.
   Whether Congress would do that would depend on ``many factors,
including whether the commission grants Murdoch a waiver,'' said
Tom Cohen, a staff attorney for the Senate Commerce subcommittee on
communications.

<HEAD>American Stores Warns Lucky Against Defensive Action</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of American Stores Co. warned
Lucky Stores Inc. against making a ``defensive acqusition'' that
would thwart American's $1.74 billion tender offer for the grocery
store company.
   In a letter to Lucky's board of directors Tuesday, American
Stores Chairman L.S. Skaggs said there have been ``various
reports'' that Lucky may be considering an acquisition that could
interfere with his company's bid.
   American launched a $45-a-share tender offer for the Dublin,
Calif.-based company on Monday and said it was prepared to increase
the offer to $50 a share, or about $1.93 billion, if a friendly
deal can be worked out.
   In a brief statement issued Tuesday, Lucky acknowledged that it
is reviewing both proposals. The company has urged shareholders not
to tender until its directors make a recommendation.
   Skaggs warned in his letter that any attempt by Lucky to
``frustrate the choice given to your shareholders through a
defensive acquisition'' would affect American's willingness to
increase its tender offer to $50 a share.
   He also reiterated that American would consider divesting stores
in order to mitigate any antitrust concerns that may exist.
   The combination of American, the nation's third-largest grocery
retailer with 1,700 stores and annual sales of $15 billion, and
Lucky, the sixth-largest with 480 stores and sales of $7 billion,
could produce the biggest grocery retailer in the nation, analysts
say.
   Documents filed Monday at the Security and Exchange Commission
hinted that American may be positioning itself for a hostile
takeover of Lucky, which resisted such an effort from takeover
specialist Asher Edelman 16 months ago. In return for Edelman
dropping the effort, Lucky agreed to pay his $2.8 million in legal
bills.
   American's SEC documents include a copy of the lawsuit the
company filed Friday in Delaware, which alleges Lucky and its
executive officers have breached their fiduciary duties by
``following a course of conduct directed towards entrenching
themselves in control of Lucky Stores.''
   As part of the defensive measures dating back to the Edelman
bid, Lucky voted senior management lucrative ``golden parachute''
contracts and announced a restructuring plan that included changing
the company's state of incorporation from California to Delaware
and a buy-back of 27 percent of its outstanding shares, the suit
contends.
   The company has noted that its bylaws also contain a ``poison
pill'' anti-takeover provision limiting the voting power of any
shareholder who acquires more than 10 percent of Lucky's stock.

   The stock market headed higher today, following
through on Tuesday's rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.79 to 2,006.13 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 2 to 1 in the early tally of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 632 up, 313 down and
474 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 23.01 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said the market's drop last week apparently attracted
some buyers who had been waiting for a chance to get in on the
rally in stock prices that began late last year.
   They also noted that the dollar had shown signs of steadying
again in foreign exchange. That sparked a rebound in bond prices in
Tuesday's activity.
   Wall Streeters were generally pleased with the government's
report Tuesday that the index of leading economic indicators rose
0.9 percent in February.
   That was taken as a signal that the economy was neither weak nor
dangerously strong.
   Texaco rose ] to 48] on top of a 3\-point jump Tuesday, when
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. said it would seek regulatory
clearance to buy as much as 15 percent of the company's stock.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .49 to 147.71. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up 1.00 at 295.33.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 18.57 to
1,998.34.
   Advancing issues outpaced declines by more than 2 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 1,015 up, 467 down and 482 unchanged. Big Board volume
totaled 152.69 million shares, against 142.82 million in the
previous session.

<DATELINE>MINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An offer by the Long Island Power Authority
to purchase Long Island Lighting Co. for $971 million was termed
``ridiculous'' by some industry analysts.
   The state agency's decision to attempt a takeover was made after
a study showed electric rates on Long Island would be 12 percent
lower under a publicly-operated utility.
   LILCO had not yet received the offer, made Tuesday in a letter
to LILCO Chairman William Catacosinos and the utility's board of
directors, said James Lois, a LILCO spokesman.
   ``Should an offer come in we would seriously evaluate it, and
inform our shareholders of the offer,'' Lois said.
   The proposal contemplates that LIPA would acquire through a
friendly merger transaction all 111 million outstanding shares of
LILCO common stock at $8.75 per share.
   LILCO stock was trading at $9 a share, down 12{ cents, in early
New York Stock Exchange trading today.
   The proposal also contemplates that LIPA would acquire all
outstanding shares of LILCO preferred stock.
   Financing is expected to be provided through the sale of
approximately $7.45 billion of long-term, tax-exempt bonds,
officials said.
   It was not known if LIPA's offer, which is open until April 15,
would be considered at a previously scheduled LILCO board meeting
today.
   Gary F. Hovis, a utility analyst at Argus Research Corp., called
the offer ``somewhat funny or ridiculous.''
   ``Obviously, the board of directors of LILCO won't even think
about accepting this offer,'' he said.
   He said it was so far below the true value of the company that
even the less sophisticated investors would quickly reject it if it
were ever approved by the LILCO board and sent to the 118,000
shareholders for a vote.
   ``That is a number that is well below what was generally
expected,'' said analyst Paul Parshley at Donaldson, Lufkin &
Jenrette Securities Inc. ``I would certainly expect the company
would reject the bid and that would begin a bargaining process.''
   He and other analysts said an offer was not likely to be
seriously considered until it reaches at least $12 per share.
   LIPA's nine-member board of trustees met for several hours in
closed session Tuesday before voting to attempt the takeover at
what Mack called the average trading price of LILCO stock over the
past 30 days.
   LIPA is an independent state agency formed in January 1987 by
Gov. Mario Cuomo and the Legislature to decide if a takeover of
LILCO would lower rates. LIPA also is trying to prevent LILCO's
Shoreham nuclear plant from operating.
   The $5.2 billion plant, one of the most expensive ever built, is
currently licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to operate
at up to 5 percent of full power.
   LILCO officials have continued to press for a full operating
license for the plant, contending it is needed to meet the growing
electric demands on Long Island.
   Cuomo and local officials have argued against granting a full
operating license to Shoreham, saying Long Island could not be
safely evacuated in the event of an accident at the plant, located
on the island's north shore about 50 miles from Manhattan.
   Federal law requires that an approved evacuation plan be in
place before a nuclear power plant can be granted a license.

<HEAD>Kodak Completes Deal With Fuqua On Photofinishing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. and Fuqua Industries
Inc., wasting no time after a favorable court decision, announced
today they had merged their photofinishing operations.
   The new company, Qualex Inc., was formed on Tuesday immediately
after the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans reversed a
federal court injunction that had blocked the merger since Feb. 22.
   Qualex combines Fuqua's photofinishing subsidiary, Colorcraft
Corp., with Kodak-owned laboratories, forming the country's largest
wholesale photofinishing operation. It has 94 processing labs
around the country.
   ``We've been delayed in doing this by the lawsuit so we wanted
to get it done as soon as we could. Our target date for having this
merger completed had been Feb. 1,'' said Paul Allen, a Kodak
spokesman.
   The company will be based in Durham, N.C., the home of
Colorcraft. Colorcraft's former chairman, D. Carl Hamill, will
serve as chief executive officer.
   Allen said the Court of Appeals granted permission for the
merger to go ahead immediately, even though a lawsuit trying to
prevent it is still being argued.
   ``The court noted that a merger can always be undone at a later
date,'' Allen said.
   A small wholesale photofinisher, Phototron Corp. of San
Bernardino, Calif., filed the lawsuit to block the merger because
Phototron officials claimed it would create unfair competition in
the market.
   A federal judge in Fort Worth, Texas, where the lawsuit was
filed, issued an injunction Feb. 22 preventing the merger, but that
decision was reversed Tuesday in New Orleans.
   That lawsuit is expected to continue, Allen said.

<TEXT>
   BATUS Financial Services Inc. has
extended the expiration date of its tender offer to purchase all
outstanding common shares of Farmers Group Inc. for $63 per share
in cash to April 27, company officials said today.
   BATUS Financial Services is a wholly owned subsidiary of BATUS
Inc.
   The offer was initially scheduled to expire at midnight
Wednesday, said Wilson W. Wyatt Jr., vice president of corporate
affairs for BATUS.
   When the offer was commenced on March 3, BATUS said it expected
the offer to be extended from time to time until the approvals from
state insurance regulatory authorities are obtained. The approval
process, which is expected to take a substantial period of time, is
underway.
   As of March 29, approximately 3,570,000 shares had been tendered
pursuant to the offer, Wyatt said.

   The stock market gained ground today, following
through on Tuesday's rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 18.57 on Tuesday,
rose 11.28 to 2,009.62 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 5 in the early tally of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 751 up, 408 down and
522 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 52.02 million shares at
midmorning.
   Analysts said the market's drop last week apparently attracted
some buyers who had been waiting for a chance to get in on the
rally in stock prices that began late last year.
   They also noted that the dollar had shown signs of steadying
again in foreign exchange. That sparked a rebound in bond prices in
Tuesday's activity.
   Wall Streeters were generally pleased with the government's
report Tuesday that the index of leading economic indicators rose
0.9 percent in February.
   That was taken as a signal that the economy was neither weak nor
dangerously strong.
   Texaco rose } to 48} on top of a 3\-point jump Tuesday, when
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. said it would seek regulatory
clearance to buy as much as 15 percent of the company's stock.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .71 to 147.93. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up 1.27 at 295.60.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Open Higher; Corn, Soybeans Retreat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures opened slightly higher but other
grain and soybean futures opened a little lower today on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat got a boost from news this morning that the Soviet Union
will bid Thursday for 500,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat, analysts
said.
   Acceptance of the bid by the Agriculture Department would
complete a Soviet purchase of 1 million metric tons of wheat
recently offered under the USDA's Export Enhancement Program.
   But the U.S. is likely to offer the Soviets another million
metic tons of subsidized wheat in the near future, said Richard
Loewy, senior grain and oilseed analyst for Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   Corn and soybean prices retreated on profit-taking ahead of
Thursday's eagerly awaited government reports on spring planting
intentions and grain stocks, Loewy said.
   Soybeans also drifted lower on ideas that arid conditions in an
important Brazilian soybean-growing region probably had not caused
as much crop damage as some had feared, he said.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent to 1} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.02{ a bushel; corn was { cent to
1 cent lower with May at $2.11 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1}
cents lower with May at $1.62 a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents to
1} cents lower with May at $6.48} a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .25 cent lower to .20 cent higher with April at
75.30 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .35 cent lower
with March at 82.75 cents a pound; hogs were .25 cent lower to .20
cent higher with April at 45.75 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .30 cent lower to .15 cent higher with May at 55.90 cents a
pound.
   Most livestock and meat futures settled lower on Tuesday.

   The government announced that the nation's
economy grew a tiny 1.4 percent last year, recovering from a steep
recession that had hobbled the economy in 1986.
   The office of President Miguel de la Madrid delivered late
Tuesday to the federal legislature its report on the state of the
economy in 1987.
   ``The advances reached with the (government's economic) plan and
its programs were substantial,'' it said.
   The report said non-oil exports soared 24 percent, giving the
nation a surplus of $4.2 billion in the 1987 current account, which
is the broadest measure of a country's trading position. Mexico
recorded a deficit of $1.3 billion in its current account in 1986.
   It said unemployment declined by 3.2 percent last year,
according to its surveys of the nation's 16 major cities.
   Private analysts estimate about 18 percent of the labor force of
25 million is out of work.
   The economy contracted at an inflation-adjusted 4.0 percent in
1986.
   The government previously had reported that inflation soared a
record 159.2 percent last year.

Since '81</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Maytag Corp. said today it will suspend all
production and some support operations for one week at its Newton
plant, the first such shutdown since November 1981.
   About 2,000 workers will be affected next week at the plant that
manufactures washers, dryers, dishwashers and in-sink food waste
disposers.
   ``Very strong first-quarter merchandising programming resulted
in dealers buying ahead and the short-term correction is needed to
bring factory and dealer inventories back into line,'' the company
said in its announcement.
   Spokesman Ron Krajnovich said the merchandising program involved
discounted sales to dealers as an incentive to buy Maytag
appliances.
   The company said the vast majority of the production employees
affected will receive unemployment compensation and supplemental
unemployment benefit payments during the period.
   It said production would resume April 11.
   Maytag is coming off its best year ever, with a profit of $152.7
million on sales of $1.92 billion in 1987.
   But when the company released its annual report earlier this
month, Maytag Chairman Daniel J. Krumm noted 1987 was the fourth
consecutive record year for the appliance industry.
   ``The industry's growth cycle is mature, and I believe demand
will relax slightly in 1988,'' Krumm said at the time. But he also
said he expected Maytag to outperform the industry as a whole.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration's top trade official
says that the U.S. tariffs on Canadian plywood won't be lowered
until the two countries have developed ``common standards'' that
would allow American-manufactured plywood to be used north of the
border.
   In a letter to Oregon Republican Sen. Bob Packwood, U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter said the administration will propose
that U.S. and Canadian experts from two forest research
laboratories develop and draft construction standards for the use
of plywood in both countries.
   ``Under this scheme, reductions in the U.S. tariff on plywood
and other panel products would not be phased in until we get a
satisfactory solution to the technical trade problems,'' said
Yeutter.
   Packwood told reporters he was optimistic that a joint-standard
could be negotiated.
   ``This ought to solve our plywood problems with Canada,''
Packwood said.
   The proposed U.S.-Canada free trade agreement calls for
elimination of the 20 percent U.S. tariff on Canadian plywood and
the 15 percent tariff on American plywood over a 10-year period.
   But the treaty linked elimination of the tariffs to changes in
the Canadian construction codes.
   Canadians have insisted that American plywood was not sturdy
enough to withstand the harsher climate of Canada, a claim the
American plywood industry has said is unfounded.
   Earlier this month, the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Commission
(CMHC) refused to revise its building code that has essentially
blocked imports of U.S. plywood.
   The government-controlled mortgage authority rejected the
changes without even making a technical review of U.S.-manufactured
plywood.
   Northwest lawmakers, including Packwood, were outraged.
   Oregon is the leading plywood producing state and Washington
ranks No. 4. Together, the two states produce about 40 percent of
the plywood manufactured domestically.
   Yeutter said that he was ``disappointed'' with the CMHC
rejection.
   ``I believe that CMHC's action does not conform with provisions
of the free trade agreement,'' Yeutter wrote. ``My expectations of
CMHC have not been met.''
   Yeutter said that after common standards were developed and
implemented, ``then tariff reductions envisioned in the free trade
agreement could take effect.''
   Packwood said that adoption of joint construction standards
should ensure that U.S.-manufactured plywood will have access to
Canadian markets.
   ``Plywood made in Eugene, Salem or Vancouver, British Columbia,
will all be made to the same standard,'' said Packwood.

   Cash-rich companies have replaced corporate
raiders of the bust-'em-up style on the merger trail, lassoing
businesses that will increase their market share and make long-term
economic sense.
   Takeover activity, often of the hostile variety, has resumed
with a new frenzy as initial jitters about the economy have
subsided in the wake of October's stock market calamity.
   Despite nagging fears that the new wave will further restrict
competition in some industries and leave many businesses awash in
debt, the urge to merge seems ever stronger among companies bent on
raising their standing in the global marketplace.
   Lured by battered stock prices, corporations are shedding their
inhibitions about making overtures that are ``unsolicited,'' a
euphemism for hostile bids.
   Fears that taking the role of aggressor could tarnish the old
corporate image are subsiding along with concerns about the
disruptive effect an unwanted takeover might have on the target
firm's work force _ from top management defections to a sense of
alienation among the rank-and-file.
   Lately, ``it's become respectable for quality corporate buyers
to make unsolicited offers,'' said Michael B. Hoffman, co-director
of mergers and acquisitions at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   ``That general respectability is allowing people to come in and
do something they haven't done in the past,'' he said.
   Among the unsolicited offers is American Store Co.'s nearly $2
billion bid for Lucky Stores Inc., a combination that would create
the nation's biggest supermarket chain. Elsewhere in the retail
arena, Campeau Corp. and R.H. Macy & Co. have both bid more than $6
billion for Federated Department Stores Inc.
   Some companies are so intent to jump on the acquisition
bandwagon, they're launching tender offers after a target company
has signed an agreement with another suitor.
   General Electric Corp., which analysts are quick to note has
never pursued an unfriendly deal, launched a $507 million tender
offer for Roper Corp. after the appliance and lawn equipment maker
agreed to be acquired by Whirlpool Corp.
   SmithKline Beckman Corp. went after International Clinical
Laboratories Inc. to beef up its lab network even though the
company already had agreed to be acquired by Corning Glass Works.
   Acquiring another company is a quicker and often cheaper way of
broadening product lines and gaining market share. Instead of
building a factory from the foundation up over the course of
several years, corporations can expand their distribution channels
instantly by snapping up a competitor.
   Even Eastman Kodak Co.'s megapurchase of Sterling Drug Inc. for
$5.1 billion _ the largest completed deal so far this year _ is not
a wild diversification move for the camera maker, some argue.
   Large companies also are aiming to outgun their foreign
counterparts.
   ``Market share is being divided up _ and U.S. companies are
consolidating to meet foreign competition coming in,'' said Robert
Willard, managing director and head of mergers and acqusitions at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   To the extent that companies are leading the effort as opposed
to raiders, the latest wave ``is clearly healthier,'' said Willard,
who noted that the recent combinations not only ``make economic
sense ... but probably at the end of the day there is less
dislocation in terms of employees forming stronger economic units
to be competitive on worldwide basis.''
   But Hoffman said it is ``definitely not clear that these are
somehow better than the mergers of the past.'' It's difficult to
argue whether Campeau or Macy would be an inherently better partner
for Federated, he said.
   Still, an increasing percentage of transactions ``are not
bust-up or junk-bond driven; they appear to be driven by
synergistic ideals,'' said Stephen Fraidin, a partner of Fried,
Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, a leading
mergers-and-acquisition law firm.
   Changes in tax laws have made the breaking up of companies not
as attractive for raiders who must sell off parts of targets just
to finance the actual acquisition.
   Corporations have an opportunity to display their natural
advantage in winning deals _ namely, they have deep pockets and can
borrow cheaper than raiders relegated to the high-yield but risky
junk-bond markets.
   And there's no question that corporations are in a strong cash
position right now. Buoyed by a weaker dollar that has made
American exports more attractive, corporations' after-tax profits
shot up 8.4 percent in last year to $137.4 billion for the first
increase since 1984, according to Commerce Department figures.
   While the number of takeover deals announced seems to have
slowed, the dollar value has increased steadily. In December, 484
deals were announced for a total dollar value of $16.1 billion. But
the 364 deals announced in February carried a combined price tag of
$32.7 billion.
   Experts say the pace will wear on. ``All the forces in place
that have contributed to the first three months (of 1988 activity)
we see as continuing into the forseeable future,'' said J. Tomilson
Hill, co-head of mergers and acquisitons at Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc.
   ``Banks are fully prepared to provide a substantial amount of
credit, there's bridge financing from the investment banks,'' and
while there are fewer bargains in terms of stock prices now than a
few months ago, ``prices nevertheless are still on average below
their highs'' he said.
   Ironically, mergers are now providing some support for stocks as
takeover issues dominate the play on an otherwise dull Wall Street.
   On the downside looms the specter of an economy constrained by
too much debt and too little competition.
   In the concrete and construction materials business alone, three
major takeover attempts are under way, two of which are being
spearheaded by foreign firms. Beazer PLC of Britain has made a bid
for Koppers Co.; Brierly Investments Ltd. of New Zealand is seeking
to acquire Calmat Co.; while Moore McCormack Resources Inc. has
rebuffed an offer from Southdown Inc.
   Ultimately, the bill for such combinations will have to be paid.
   ``There's the danger of getting into a situation where companies
are so highly leveraged that it becomes a question whether they can
survive an economic downturn,'' said Jay Lorsch, a professor at
Harvard Business School.
   Some experts criticize restructuring in the face of a takeover
as too short sighted. To fend off a hostile bidder, companies often
take on debt to make themselves less attractive. Or as an
alternative defensive move, companies sell off assets that may be
weak at the moment without considering their long-term potential.
   ``It's like the Hong Kong race track _ everybody's betting on
the short term and not that the earnings of a company will rise''
over the long haul, Lorsch said.

   In an office park in this Seattle suburb,
a staff of 92 people is kept busy answering questions like, ``When
I'm in the Legend of Zelda, how do I find the Tri-Force in level
seven underworld labyrinth?''
   In most customer service departments, that would stop 'em cold.
   But for executives at the home office of Nintendo of America
Inc., the 40,000 to 50,000 children who call each week with such
arcane inquiries about Nintendo's home video games are a reassuring
sign their toy is still tops.
   A little over 18 months ago, Nintendo, a 99-year-old Japanese
playing card manufacturer and maker of the popular arcade game
``Donkey Kong,'' jumped headlong into home video games, an American
market most thought was stone dead.
   Today, the wholly owned subsidiary of Nintendo Co. Ltd. of Japan
claims to have captured 70 percent of a U.S. market that should hit
$1.9 billion in 1988.
   For 1987, Nintendo of America had sales of $750 million out of a
$1.1 billion market. That helped push profits for Nintendo Ltd. to
$172.8 million on sales of $987 million for fiscal year 1987,
ending Aug. 31, compared with profits of $113.1 million on sales of
$829.5 million in fiscal 1986.
   ``Without question they're the preeminent force in the video
game industry,'' said Rick Anguilla, editor of Toy & Hobby World, a
trade publication that has ranked the Nintendo Entertainment System
as the top-selling toy for the past six months.
   ``They learned from the mistakes that were made the first time
around and they had the foresight to see that the American
consumers were not the ones who stopped playing video games,''
Anguilla said. ``It was more a case of American and Japanese
manufacturers putting so much bad product in the marketplace that
it sort of ruined it for everybody.''
   At the height of the video craze, $3 billion in games were sold
in 1982, Nintendo says. But by 1985 the fad appeared over, with
sales just $100 million and manufacturers unloading $35 game
cartridges for $5 or less.
   About that time, Nintendo began test-marketing its entertainment
system _ a small computer that played game cartridges, and two sets
of control panels. Add in a light gun and foot-high robot that
would act out some games and the list price was $199.95.
   ``You really have to admire the nerve to walk into a lot of
retailers in 1985 and ask if they wanted to buy a video game,''
Anguilla said.
   But Bill White, Nintendo advertising and public relations
director, said the product had been wildly successful in Japan,
selling more than 10 million units since 1983, with games in 30
percent of all Japanese homes.
   ``We liked it right from the start,'' said Michael Goldstein,
chief financial officer for the retailing giant Toys R Us. The more
detailed and higher-quality games made consumers feel they were
getting their money's worth, he said.
   If there's been a problem, Goldstein said, it's been supply.
``When you have something that's hot, it sells out,'' he said.
   For last Christmas, the game packages were reconfigured,
eliminating the robot, and sold for around $100.
   White said that nearly four months later, Nintendo still has
trouble keeping up with demand. It shipped 3 million entertainment
systems last year, and recently upped its 1988 forecast from 5
million to 7 million.
   Steven Eisenberg, leisure industry analyst for Bear, Stearns &
Co. in New York, said he doubts such growth can be sustained. But
he said the video game industry has re-established its stability
and should see long-term gowth of 12 percent to 15 percent a year.
   Competitors Atari Corp., with about 16 percent of the market,
and Tonka Co.'s Sega, with about 10 percent, may make some inroads,
but are far from challenging Nintendo's dominance, Eisenberg said.
   What brought video games back from the dead, Eisenberg said,
were Nintendo's elaborate graphics, sharp resolution and
high-quality sound. Also, notes Anguilla, there's a factor
toymakers call ``play value'' _ what laymen call ``fun.''
   The old-style games often had plots as simple as eradicating
space bugs flitting around the screen. But Nintendo games are
intricate. The top seller, a sword-and-sorcery yarn called ``The
Legend of Zelda,'' leads players through 700 scenes in which they
defeat wizards, solve mazes and eventually rescue the Princess
Zelda _ a process that can take up to 90 hours, and then be played
all over again.
   Nintendo maintains strict control, awarding licenses to game
makers to produce five new titles a year each. Nintendo gets final
say on content.
   Among the 55 existing or planned titles are a souped-up version
of ``Donkey Kong'' called ``Super Mario Bros.;'' ``Rad Racer,'' a
car-race game, ``Ice Hockey,'' and ``Mike Tyson's Punch-Out,'' a
boxing game promoted by the heavyweight champ.
   Howard Phillips is Nintendo's product analysis manager, in
charge of approving the games. He's more widely known, however, as
president of the Fun Club, a fan organization with more than 1
million on its magazine's mailing list.
   Phillips says Nintendo is looking at expanding beyond its
initial target market of boys 8-15, with more adventure games and
versions of the TV shows ``Jeopardy'' and ``Wheel of Fortune'' that
should appeal to adults.
   In Japan, the Nintendo box has been used to provide stock market
quotes, home shopping and even to power a knitting machine, he said.
   Phillips also oversees the phone bank of game counselors, who,
he says, get asked the Zelda and the Tri-Force question about 5,000
times a week.
   The answer? ``Go to the tip of the nose and defeat all the Wall
Masters and push all the blocks, and a secret passage will
appear,'' he said.
   ``The kids will know all about that.''

   While legions of Wall Streeters have headed for
the unemployment lines since October's market crash, some
high-rolling investment bankers, takeover lawyers and acquisition
hand-holders have shifted into fifth gear.
   ``We've been intensely busy for a long time; now we are,
perhaps, intensely busier,'' said Stephen Fraidin, a partner of
Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, a New York law firm that
handles takeovers.
   Some of the more entrepreneurial members of this inner sanctum
have shifted out of old-line establishments altogether to set up
their own shops, otherwise known as ``boutiques.''
   Indeed, some of the hottest talk on Wall Street of late
surrounded the string of defections from First Boston Corp.'s
mergers and acquisitions department. Superstars Bruce Wasserstein
and Joseph R. Perella, who ran the highly successful operation,
announced in February they were leaving to form their own firm,
taking a score of staffers with them.
   ``First Boston was wiped out in that department,'' one Wall
Street insider said. Wasserstein and Perella took the 20 best
people, ``and they are the business,'' he added.
   These boutiques are not merely high-class consulting firms. With
huge pools of international money available from pension funds,
insurance companies and the like, they have access to enough
capital to spin their own deals.
   And boutiques are counting big players as clients. The
Blackstone Group advised Japan's Bridgestone Corp. on its proposed
venture with Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., while Wasserstein,
Perella & Co. is counseling Campeau Corp. in its battle against
R.H. Macy & Co. for Federated Department Stores Inc.
   One senior mergers and acquisitions banker said boutiques have
created ``a second force'' in an industry that has evolved into a
veritable ``oligopoly.''
   ``There are three firms among us that are capturing probably 80
percent of the takeover market,'' he said in reference to Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Morgan Stanley & Co.
   Boutiques are vying hard for that remaining 20 percent.
   This banker predicted that the recent wave of takeover activity
could push first-quarter profits to record heights at the three
major houses.
   ``Merger activity is carrying over to the results of the overall
firm,'' he said.
   But that may be the very reason boutiques are popping up.
   ``Since the M and A people are on top at the moment, they want
it all for themselves and do not want to carry everybody else. So
they start their own boutiques,'' said Robert Pirie, president of
Rothschild Inc., which has advised Sir James Goldsmith, the
Anglo-French financier.

   United Press International will continue
as a 24-hour-a-day worldwide wire service and will reduce its staff
and seek joint ventures with other companies, the firm's new owners
said today.
   UPI Chairman Earl W. Brian and President Paul Steinle said they
were committed to seeing the 81-year-old wire service, which is
losing $2 million a month, survive into the 21st century.
   The UPI officials, in a statement released at a news conference,
said their new business plan calls for ``continuation of the
company as a full-service, 24-hour-a-day, worldwide supplier of
news and information.''
   To accomplish these goals, UPI will lay off as many as 150
staffers worldwide, but fewer than 100 of those will be from the
editorial side, Steinle said. ``At this time we do not anticipate
further cutbacks,'' he said. To assist the departing staffers, UPI
will provide a benefits package and help them find new jobs.
   Steinle said the wire service's operators, who took control of
the company in February, had conducted a market survey based on
interviews with 500 senior executives in the news industry.
   ``As a result we are making major changes in the way we design
and deliver our products and are instituting procedures to ensure
that we are constantly sensitive to what our customers want,'' he
said.
   Steinle said UPI's development will start at the ``grass roots''
and will focus on strengthening state and regional reporting. He
said the wire service also will stress technical reporting.
   ``This includes an increased emphasis on business and financial
news and analysis and its effect on the consumer, plus more and
better reporting in areas such as health, science, law and
medicine,'' he said.
   Many of the changes will be phased in over the next several
months, but UPI clients should see immediate improvements as a
result of staff training programs to develop greater writing
clarity and succinctness, the announcement said.
   The statement said the wire service expects to save $10 million
in the first year through administrative cost controls. Additional
savings will come from pooling resources with other companies that
offer joint venture potential for UPI in the information industry.
   Moreover, there will be ``a gradual unbundling of UPI products''
over the next year, which will give the company an opportunity to
reprice products and expand those sought by customers.
   Brian said the people targeted for layoffs were notified
personally today, and about 35 were offered early retirement. The
staff reductions amount to 14 percent of UPI's employees, he said.
   Asked how UPI hoped to improve coverage with fewer people,
Steinle said the staff will be ``not as large but more focused.''
   For instance, he said, efforts are being made to improve
productivity by reprogramming computers to perform routine
functions, such as automatic pronouncers for broadcast copy.
   Additionally, the Spanish-language translation desk will be
moved from Washington to Central or Latin America, UPI announced.
   Brian said the unbundling of UPI's products will allow customers
to buy the services they want without having to purchase unwanted
services. This type of unbundling, he said, should help UPI sales
with non-media clients, who are expected to make up more of the
wire service's client base in the future.
   Brian, the new chairman, said, ``I estimate approximately $15
million in permanent equity financing will be required by the time
we have completed the second phase of the business plan.''
   The first phase of the business plan, expected to take three to
six months, is designed to stabilize the company. The second phase
will redirect the company into new and expanded lines of business.
   All told, the two-year business plan should bring UPI to
profitability in two years, Brian said.
   Until equity financing is in place, bridge financing will be
made available by WNW Group Inc. and Infotechnology Inc.
   Brian is chairman of WNW, a media investment group formed to
take control of UPI, and Infotechnology, a New York-based
information technology and venture capital firm.
   ``We know how to operate companies within their means and we
have links to other companies with significant future joint venture
potential for UPI in the information industry,'' Brian said.
   As an example of joint-venture possibilities, Brian cited a new
electronic news and information product called DBC SuperNews,
created by Financial News Network, Data Broadcasting Corp. _ an FNN
subsidiary _ and Comtex Scientific Corp. DBC SuperNews allows
anyone with a personal computer at over 28 million cable TV sites
to receive real-time news on any subject gathered from UPI and
other major news sources by Comtex.
   SuperNews will be available at very low cost because FNN can
deliver it by satellite as part of its regular television signal.
   Brian and Infotechnology own about 20 percent of FNN.

   President Reagan today urged congressional
approval of his request for $365 million to begin construction of
the superconducting super collider, saying the technology it
represents is ``changing the way we live.''
   ``I know that some people may question the practical
applications of the superconducting super collider,'' the president
said. ``The strange world of subatomic particles, they may think,
will never be more than an arcane interest to a few highly
specialized scientists.''
   ``But the truth is the practical applications of this new
technology are already changing the way we live,'' the president
told a gathering of science students and others in the Rose Garden.
   ``Every time someone turns on his desk computer, makes a phone
call or plays a video game, he is plugging into that mysterious
world of quantum physics,'' Reagan said. ``The superconducting
super collider is the doorway to that new world of quantum change.''
   The superconducting super collider will investigate the origin
and nature of matter by whirling beams of protons into each other
at an energy 20 times greater than is now possible in a
53-mile-around underground tunnel.
   The students in the audience were part of a program established
in 1985 that gives top students from each state an opportunituy to
work for two weeks in the summer at national laboratories in the
Washington area.
   Reagan approved construction of the collider, the world's
largest energy particle accelerator, in January 1987. The
Department of Energy asked for site proposals in April 1987, and 36
of the 43 proposals received were judged qualified.
   The National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of
Engineering selected eight as the best qualified. The sites were in
Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, New York, North Carolina,
Tennessee and Texas.
   Secretary of Energy John S. Herrington is sheduled to recommend
a preferred site in July and the final site is to be chosen in
January after an environmental imnpact study.
   Some scientists oppose the project, saying it would be too
expensive and drain money from more desirable scientific projects.
   However, six Nobel laureates, four of whom were present for the
ceremony, wrote Reagan that the project ``represents America's
commitment to the pursuit of excellence in basic scientific
research.''
   Although Reagan spoke seriously of his dedication to the
project, he opened his remarks with a joke about it.
   ``When I first heard about this place where things go round and
round at great speeds and then crash into each other, I thought
tney were talking about a presidential campaign,'' the president
said.

<HEAD>Fliers Racing To Beat Triple-Mileage Deadline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thursday is the last day to qualify for the big
airlines' triple-mileage programs and travelers have been flocking
to the skies to beat the deadline.
   ``This is their time to strike,'' said Suzanne Jensen, a
spokeswoman for Uniglobe Travel (International) Inc., a large
travel agency franchiser based in Richmond, British Columbia.
   To drum up business in the slow winter months, the major
airlines offered to triple all mileage credits accumulated by
participants in frequent-flier programs this year _ if the member
took at least one round-trip or two one-way flights on that carrier
between by the end of the day Thursday.
   The deadline, coupled with the approach of Easter and school
vacations, seems to have touched off a flying spree _ with many
travelers taking short, relatively cheap flights in order to
qualify for the bonus mileage.
   The rush has mainly caught up ordinary consumers rather than
frequent business travelers, who qualified earlier in the year for
triple credits.
   ``There may be some short hops out there being taken for
qualifying trips,'' said Alan Loflin, a spokesman for Pan Am Corp.
``We were extremely heavy this weekend all over the (Pan Am)
system.''
   He said traffic was especially thick on Pan Am's Northeast
corridor shuttle service and on Pan Am Express _ both short-haul
operations for the international carrier. Pan Am Express serves
about a dozen cities in the Northeast and feeds into the airline's
main hub in New York, while the shuttle links New York, Washington
and Boston.
   Uniglobe's Jensen reported an especially big flurry of business
in the West and Midwest _ with a lot of Western customers booking
short trips from Los Angeles, for example, to Las Vegas, San
Francisco or San Diego.
   Launched at the start of the year by Delta Air Lines, the
triple-mileage marketing weapon was quickly embraced by other major
carriers hoping to bolster business during the first quarter, which
is traditionally the slowest for leisure travel.
   Triple mileage is an extension of the popular frequent-flier
programs, which reward passengers with free tickets or upgrades to
first class after they have flown a set number of miles.
   ``We've had some very heavy passenger loads the past few days,''
said Dan Sheehy, a spokesman for United Airlines. ``It looks like
people are rushing to qualify for triple mileage.''
   United, the nation's largest airline, saw passengers board its
planes in record numbers last weekend on its 400 or so daily
flights out of its hub at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport,
Sheehy reported. Boardings on Friday, Saturday and Sunday ranged
from around 45,000 to more than 49,000 a day _ compared with
United's average rate of 30,000 to 35,000.
   Second-ranked American Airlines had a similar increase in
passenger traffic last weekend, spokeswoman Mary O'Neill said.
   Eastern Airlines also has experienced a ``travel frenzy''
recently, spokeswoman Paula Musto said, citing the twin factors of
Easter and the triple-mileage deadline.
   Observers said most major airlines are reaping the same
last-minute windfall _ with one notable exception. Delta, which
started the triple-mileage competition, did not impose a deadline
for eligibility, spokesman Neil Monroe said.
   Delta's frequent-flier program, including the triple mileage
feature, is also unique in that all tickets must be charged on an
American Express card.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Japanese government hailed the U.S.-Japan
accord on access to Japan's construction market, but Japanese
construction executives expressed wariness about the agreement
Wednesday.
   ``Since this agreement came about when Japanese firms are still
barred from the U.S. public works market, I am dissatisfied,''
Hajime Sako, president of the Japan Federation of Construction
Contractors, said in a statement.
   Washington banned Japanese companies from U.S. public works
projects last year because of Japan's restrictive policies.
   ``It is good that the two countries were able to reach an
agreement,'' Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita told reporters.
   Construction Minister Ihei Ochi said he was satisfied that Japan
had done enough to help American companies take part in Japanese
construction projects, long seen as representing continued closure
of Japan's markets.
   Japan will honor the agreement and with the cooperation of
Japan's construction industry, ``I hope things will go smoothly in
the future,'' Ochi said.
   Japanese and U.S. negotiators agreed Japan will encourage
foreign participation in major public works projects financed by
the Japanese government and other projects carried out by Japanese
companies with funding from both the central and local governments.
   The United States had threatened to invoke a law calling for
retaliation unless negotiations this week produced an accord
allowing U.S. companies to bid on an equal footing with Japanese
firms for hundreds of millions of dollars of work in large public
works projects in Japan.
   Such projects include airports and airport terminals _
particularly the planned Kansai International Airport in western
Japan _ plus conference halls, expressways and bridges.
   Keizo Obuchi, chief cabinet secretary and Takeshita's top aide,
told a press conference the successful conclusion of the Washington
talks was a victory over protectionism, and said he hoped the
agreement will have a ``favorable influence'' over deliberations in
the U.S. Congress on various trade bills.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, construction company stocks were
boosted by the progress of the talks and announcement of the
accord, possibly because investors believed it would lead the
United States to drop restrictions on them.
   Since Monday, Shimizu Construction surged 33 yen to 934 yen
$7.42) per share, while Taisei Corp. rose 22 yen to 969 yen ($7.75)
and Kajima Corp. jumped 40 yen to 1,550 yen ($12.40).
   Japanese construction executives, however, expressed caution.
   Sako said he was happy Japan has been able to prevent U.S.
retaliation, but said it was unavoidable that Japan had to
compromise to bring about a resolution to the deadlock.
   Teruzo Yoshino, president of Shimizu Construction, thanked the
government Wednesday for reaching a conclusion without U.S.
retaliation, but stopped short of endorsing the accord.
   ``From now, I hope the Japanese industry discusses the issue
fully ... to develop a policy,'' Yoshino said in a statement.
   The European Economic Community charged the Japan-U.S. agreement
ignores other countries.
   ``The EC has repeatedly warned against bilateral deals on trade
and public procurement and particularly against this tendency
between Japan and the U.S.,'' said Michael Lake, a counsellor at
the EC delegation in Tokyo.
   ``European firms have shown more practical interest than
American firms in the Kansai airport,'' he said. ``We do not regard
any U.S.-Japan deal as infringing on our rights to pursue our own
interests in this market.''
   A French firm's design was chosen for the Kansai airport's
terminal, and European firms are hoping to follow with actual
construction contracts.

<HEAD>Construction Contracts Up 10 Percent in February</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: For Release at 6:30 p.m. EST</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contracting for future construction projects
jumped 10 percent in February, recouping January's 8 percent
decline, according to a report published Thursday.
   The survey, by the F.W. Dodge Division of McGraw-Hill
Information Systems Co., estimated the annualized value of all
newly started construction projects in February at $249.7 billion,
the highest level since last October.
   While the February increase was paced by a 14 percent surge in
nonresidential building, the construction information service said
housing and public works also contributed to the advance.
   The gain in nonresidential construction was concentrated in
commercial and industrial buildings, up 32 percent, while
institutional construction projects declined 11 percent.
   F.W. Dodge said its seasonally adjusted index of construction
contracting rose to 159 in February from 145 in January, which was
its lowest level in two years. The index is based on a level of 100
for 1982.
   ``Because construction activity can be notoriously erratic
during the winter months, February's welcome gain in contracting
needs to be paired with January's sharp decline,'' said George A.
Christie, vice president and chief economist for F.W. Dodge.
   Taken together, he said, January and February showed the rate of
new construction contracting to be 5 percent below the fourth
quarter of last year, extending a gentle decline from the peak rate
reached in the third quarter of 1987.
   Contracting for residential buildings rose 9 percent in February
to an annualized value of $120.2 billion, according to the report.
It noted, however, that the improvement was limited to multi-family
housing and hotels and motels, while the single-family sector
showed little change.
   Public works and utility construction in February was valued at
$43.4 billion, up 3 percent from January but 5 percent below the
average level in 1987.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maxwell Communication Corp. PLC, a group
controlled by British publisher Robert Maxwell, said Wednesday that
its pre-tax profit more than doubled in 1987, boosted by strong
gains in publishing, printing and from property sales.
   The company said its pre-tax profit for the year came to 166
million pounds, or $309 million, compared with 80.3 million pounds,
or $149 million, in 1986.
   At the same time, Maxwell said the company was close to
acquiring an Australian newspaper, the Melbourne Age, from
Australian media group John Fairfax Ltd.
   Maxwell added that he expected to reach and agreement with
Fairfax on the acquisition in two weeks. The Age is part of a
package of properties, which include the British weekly The
Spectator, which Fairfax is offering for sale.
   Maxwell Communication said its profit after taxes also more than
doubled to 134.3 million pounds, or $250 million, from 64.4 million
pounds, or $120 million.
   Sales spurted 91 percent to 884.1 million pounds, or $1.64
billion, from 461.7 million pounds, or $859 million.
   The company didn't break out quarterly or half-year results. It
isn't required to under British law.

<HEAD>Last Year's Farm Export Rise Could Be a Hopeful Sign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new Agriculture Department analysis of last
year's trade situation helps point the direction for U.S. farm
exports in 1988 and beyond, if a year or two can be called the
beginning of a trend.
   Basically, the report showed that the value of agricltural
exports in the 1988 calendar year rose, while imports of
agricultural commodities declined. That resulted in a larger trade
balance in favor of American farmers.
   The periodic report is called FATUS, which stands for Foreign
Agricultural Trade of the United States. It was issued last week by
the department's Economic Research Service.
   A bit of background may be useful.
   One of the quirks of USDA agencies that sometimes confuses as
well as informs is the practice of compiling statistics for
different time periods. There is the fiscal year, which begins each
Oct. 1, and the calender year, which commences on Jan. 1.
   Then there are crop years, which vary according to the
commodity, and the marketing year, which is just as confusing and
can include livestock as well as crops. International trade figures
often are reported for years beginning on July 1.
   Under most circumstances, the most popular USDA farm trade
figures are those for the fiscal year running fr     4.5  0

   Hugh A. Barker has announced plans to
retire as chairman and chief executive officer of Public Service
Indiana early next year.
   Barker, who made his announcement to PSI officers and management
staff Wednesday morning, had informed the utility's board of
directors of his intentions on March 16, said PSI spokesman Michael
Goss.
   Barker, 62, has served as chief executive of PSI, the state's
largest utility, since 1977.
   Goss said Vice President Darrell V. Menscer would assume on an
interim basis the utility's operating responsibilities, other than
the implementation of a new holding company structure.
   PSI currently is working under a four-year agreement that
alllows the utility to increase rates and write off part of its
loss on the Marble Hill nuclear power plant, which was canceled in
1984 after $2.7 billion was spent on its construction.
   The utility had been near default before the rate agreement was
approved in March 1986 by state regulators, but creditors granted
PSI a reprieve after the agreement was negotiated.
   PSI serves about 542,000 customers in 69 Indiana counties.

<TEXT>
   The British pound has jumped to its highest level
in two years, boosted by a strong economy, Britain's relatively
high interest rates and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
unrelenting grip on inflation.
   Sterling held relatively steady for 12 months and was uncapped
when the Conservative government decided earlier this month to ease
central bank intervention and allow the pound to rise above a
previous target against the West German mark.
   ``It is a currency renaissance,'' said Keith Skeoch, chief
economist at the London investment firm James Capel and Co. ``What
we're beginning to see is the transition of sterling from being one
of the weaker brethren among the international currencies to one of
the stronger.''
   Jonathan Lopatin, vice president for foreign exchange dealing at
Goldman Sachs & Co. in London, said, ``The authorities decided to
allow sterling exchange rates to rise.''
   The Bank of England's index measuring the pound's trade-weighted
value against 17 currencies finished at 77.7 on Wednesday,
unchanged from Tuesday, when it rose 0.6 point to reach its highest
level since closing at 78 on Jan. 16, 1986.
   On Wednesday, the pound rose to $1.8790 from $1.8705, and to
3.1225 West German marks from 3.1069 marks.
   In the past seven years, the pound has hit a low of $1.0470, in
February 1985, and a high of $2.4525 in November 1980.
   Until taking the rein off the pound this month, the government,
through the Bank of England's sale of pounds and purchase of West
German marks, had closely guarded a rate of 3 marks. It also has
controlled sterling by signaling changes in interest rates.
   ``But that ceiling was lifted because there was a great deal of
market pressure pushing sterling up. At that rate, more people
wanted to buy it than sell it,'' Lopatin said.
   ``It certainly has been made clear in the eye of the foreign
exchange market and investors that the government is more concerned
about the threat of inflation than they are at holding the exchange
rate at any particular level.''
   Mrs. Thatcher's priority has been to control inflation, now
running at an annual rate of 3.3 percent compared with a 18 percent
in 1980.
   That means the government is less likely to cut interest rates
further for fear of reigniting inflation.
   Britain's high interest rates, compared with the rates of other
major industrialized nations, make pound-denominated investments
more attractive and create demand for sterling.
   The British commercial banks' base lending rate _ a benchmark
interest rate _ stands at 8.5 percent.
   The strong economy, however, is the underlying factor pushing up
the pound.
   Britain's gross domestic product _ its total output of goods and
services _ is expected to grow 3 percent in 1988, faster than any
of its major trading partners except Japan. That will be the
economy's seventh consecutive year of expansion.
   Other pro-pound factors are a fiscal budget surplus, the first
in nearly 20 years, announced March 15, political stability and a
Conservative government.
   ``They all are the hallmarks of a basically hard currency,''
Skeoch said.
   The trade deficit is forecast to widen sharply with the strong
currency, which can hurt exports and encourage imports.
   On Tuesday, the pound also was boosted by rumors that Chancellor
of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson had resigned, even though the
Treasury issued a denial, and by a later statement from Mrs.
Thatcher that she and her finance minister weren't split on policy.
   The pound would be allowed to find its own level under a new
chancellor, dealers first speculated. Then they decided the
authorities won't step in to restrain the pound, even if he stayed.
   ``Both Mr. Lawson and I put downward pressure on inflation as
top-most priority. Both of us think interest rate stability can be
very useful to industry,'' Mrs. Thatcher said in response to a
question in the House of Commons.
   Mrs. Thatcher and Lawson have expressed differing views in
recent weeks _ he for restraining the pound and she being more
concerned about inflation.
   Meanwhile, the analysts expect the pound to continue to move
upward. Skeoch said he expected the pound to reach 3.20 marks
within a few months and $2.04 later in the year.

<HEAD>British Legislators Attack Plan for Government Aid to Rover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political opponents attacked Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's plan to inject 800 million pounds into
automaker Rover Group PLC when the government sells it off, calling
it an amazing giveaway.
   The Rover plan, criticized Tuesday in Parliament, would come to
the aid of the automaker with the equivalent of $1.49 billion in
government funds.
   The plan, part of Mrs. Thatcher's huge and ongoing privatization
program, also is likely to create controversy in the European
Economic Community's executive Commission, without whose approval
the plan cannot proceed.
   British Aerospace PLC announced Tuesday that it had reached an
agreement to acquire Rover from the government for 150 million
pounds, or about $279 million, a cheaper price than had been
expected. The government would make the cash injection to reduce
Rover's debt, British Aerospace said.
   Labor Party legislator Bryan Gould, who serves as a spokesman on
industrial issues for the opposition party, said the British
Aerospace announcement was astonishing and attacked the plan as an
``Easter giveaway.''
   Lord Williams, also a member of the opposition, said British
Aerospace shareholders ``will no doubt think Christmas has come
rather early this year.''
   Gould claimed that the government was paying British Aerospace
650 million pounds, enough to raise the government's child benefit
by 1 pound a week, ``to persuade them to walk away with net assets
worth 770 million'' pounds.
   Gould demanded a full House of Commons debate on the issue after
the Easter recess.
   Trade Secretary Lord Young countered: ``This is not a knock-down
price,'' and described the package as ``the deal of the decade.''
   Rover Chairman Graham Day said the sale was good for the company
and its employees.
   British Aerospace Chairman Roland Smith promised to develop the
combined company and ``not to destroy it.''
   One condition the government has attached to the Rover sale is
that British Aerospace must not dispose of any of the business
within five years.
   The Conservative Party's large majority in the House of Commons
guarantees passage of Mrs. Thatcher's policies.
   Rover Group, which is made up of automaker Austin Rover and Land
Rover, which produces utility vehicles, recently announced a 1987
profit before taxes of 27.9 million pounds, or about $52 million.
That compared with a loss of 355.6 million pounds, or around $661
million, in 1986.
   Mrs. Thatcher has sold 16.5 billion pounds worth of state-owned
companies since she came to power in 1979 as part of her
``capitalist revolution.'' Her goals have been to make those
companies more competitive as well as to get more shares into the
hands of the British public.

   Companies are increasingly demanding
concessionary contracts as a tactic for provoking strikes in an
effort to drive unions out of their plants, a House subcommittee
was told Wednesday.
   Labor leaders for now are combatting the effort by instructing
their members to keep working after a contract expires and wages
and benefits are unilaterally cut by an employer.
   But through an orchestrated series of congressional hearings,
they also are trying to build a case for lauching another attempt
to change the nation's labor laws if a Democrat is elected
president next fall so that it would be more difficult from
companies to hire strikebreakers.
   Local union officials at paper, chemical and meatpacking plants
complained Wednesday to a sympathetic subcommittee of the House
Education and Labor Committee that the National Labor Relations Act
has been turned againt them.
   Rep. William Clay, D-Mo., chairman of the committee's
labor-management relations subcommittee, said the growing
anti-union tactics adopted by employers and approved by the
National Labor Relations Board threatens the future of collective
bargaining.
   ``What was once the workers' weapon of last resort _ the strike
_ is now being used as a tool by employers to terminate bargaining
relationships,'' Clay said. ``Employers are purposely adopting
bargaining positions intended to drive their workers out on the
picket line.''
   Ken Tritz, president of a Paperworkers Union local in Missoula,
Mont., said its members have been working at a Stone Container
Corp. paper mill the past seven months without a contract after the
company tried to provoke a strike.
   As a result, he said, his members have been losing premium,
vacation and holiday pay incentives as well as some of the fringe
benefits they formerly had. He estimated the lost wages and
benefits for each worker at about $7,000 a year.
   ``The company was so convinced that it would succeed in
provoking a strike and breaking a strike ... that it prepared a
manual for strikebreakers,'' Tritz said. ``We chose to work without
a contract at this time because the alternatives were even more
obnoxious. Would you rather be shot or hung? Some choice.''
   No Stone Container officials testified at Tuesday's hearing. But
a vice president of another paper company locked in a lengthy
strike at three plants with the Paperworkers Union testifed that
union officials and their members were repeatedly warned that
replacements for them would be hired.
   ``Competition _ both domestic and foreign _ is real, serious and
does not allow a labor strike `time out,''' said John Nevin, a vice
president of International Paper Co. ``If we are not producing, one
of our competitors will gladly take our place.''

   Reynolds Metals Co., celebrating the 20th
anniversary of the first aluminum can recycling, said Wednesday it
is expanding its network of company-operated recylcing
installations.
   More than 650 units will be operating by the middle of the year,
compared with about 500 last year and about 600 now, company
officials said at a news conference.
   Since Reynolds began buying used cans in Los Angeles in 1968,
the first in the industry to do so, it has bought 88 billion cans
to melt into aluminum ingots in its furnaces.
   The industry has bought 270 billion cans, the company estimates,
and is recycling about half of current production. Reynolds itself
is recycling more than 100 percent of can production _ it buys more
cans than it sells.
   Scrap aluminum is the cheapest source of raw material, in part
because aluminum manufacture is energy-intensive. It takes 6.5
kilowatt-hours of electricity to make a can from ore and only about
5 percent of that energy to make a can from scrap.
   Reynolds started out paying 8 cents per pound. The price
fluctuates according to the world market, and currently Reynolds
pays 42 cents to 46 cents for a pound of cans, about 26 cans, or
1.6 cents to 1.8 cents per can.
   A brewer or other bottler pays about 7.5 cents for a can with a
label printed on it.
   Reynolds estimates the handling costs double that before the
metal is in a form equivalent to what would result from smelting
the ore. At that price, scrap-derived aluminum is still cheaper
than ore-derived, but the company declines to release exact figures.
   Prices have been rising recently, and aluminum trades on the
London Metal Exchange at about $1.31 a pound in the form of 19\-ton
ingots.
   Can production is rising at better than a 6 percent annual rate,
by about 5 billion cans a year. William O. Bourke, Reynolds'
president and chief executive officer, said the company believes 80
percent can be recycled by the year 2000 as more and more cities
turn to recycling programs to ease thir waste-handling problems and
the shortage of landfill space.
   But he opposed as ``not cost-effective'' the so-called ``bottle
bills'' that some states have enacted to require refundable
deposits on beverage containers.
   Manufacturers of competing containers ``should make it possible
for people to return the bottles for cash,'' he said. But he
conceded that those companies would find it difficult since their
materials are not as valuable as scrap aluminum.
   Reynolds spokesman Bob Shaffer said later the company opposed
bottle bills also to retain the good will of its bottler customers.

   Wheat futures closed slightly higher Wednesday on
the Chicago Board of Trade while corn and soybean prices retreated
in light trading.
   Wheat was supported by expectations that the Soviet Union would
bid Thursday for 500,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat, analysts said.
Acceptance of the bid by the Agriculture Department would complete
a Soviet purchase of 1 million metric tons of wheat recently
offered under the USDA's Export Enhancement Program.
   The slight downward movement of soybeans and the other grains
reflected position-evening by traders ahead of the USDA's Thursday
afternoon reports on spring planting intentions and U.S. grain
stocks, said Joel Karlin, research analyst for Research Department
Inc. in Chicago.
   ``There wasn't a whole lot of activity,'' he said. ``Everybody's
sitting on their hands before the reports.''
   At the close, wheat was { cent to 1 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.02 a bushel; corn was 1\ cents

   Five Japanese automakers have been dumping small
trucks on the U.S. market, costing U.S. workers jobs and the U.S.
auto industry $500 million in lost wages, sales and profits, a
study released Wednesday claimed.
   The 42-page study was commissioned by the U.S. Motor Vehicle
Manufacturers Association on behalf of General Motors Corp., Ford
Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.
   ``The study analysts concluded that the effect of this dumping
margin was something on the order of 140,000 lost units of
production to U.S. manufacturers,'' said MVMA President Thomas
Hanna.
   The investigation, by the Washington, D.C. law firm Wilmer,
Cutler & Pickering, found that the five Japanese companies are
selling compact pickup trucks for 10 percent to 48 percent less in
the United States than they charge in their Japanese home market.
   Dumping is illegal under trade agreements between the United
States and its foreign partners. The companies charged with dumping
by the MVMA are Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor Co., Mazda Motor
Corp., Isuzu Motor Co. and Mitsubishi Motors Corp.
   Toyota immediately denied the charges in statement by Robert
McCurry, senior vice president of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A.
   ``Any assertions that Japanese compact trucks are injuring or
threatening to injure the U.S. industry ring hollow,'' McCurry
said. ``First, U.S. producers are enjoying their greatest success
in history, collectively continuing to set records for sales and
profits.
   ``Second, Japanese truck sales continue to decline and presently
represent the smallest share of the U.S. market since compact
trucks were introduced by the Japanese,'' he said.
   McCurry has been the most outspoken Japanese auto company
executive in denying charges leveled this year, particularly by
Chrysler Corp. executives.
   In previous defenses, McCurry and executives for other Japanese
auto companies have said that the strength of the Japanese yen
against other currencies has made it cheaper for them to buy raw
materials.
   In addition, Japanese automakers have worked aggressively to cut
production costs, they said.
   In a letter accompanying the study, which was hand-delivered to
Commerce Secretary William Verity's office Tuesday afternoon, the
MVMA asked that the U.S. government begin negotiating with the
Japanese government to end the dumping.
   However, Claire Buchan, a Commerce Department spokeswoman, said
the U.S. government has only initiated a dumping investigation
once, in a semi-conductor case.
   In the vast majority of dumping cases, she said, it is up to the
U.S. industry involved to file petitions with the Commerce
Department and the International Trade Commission.
   If the two agencies find dumping has occurred and has injured a
U.S. industry, then the government assesses a duty on the imported
product that is equal to the difference between the prices charged
here and in the product's home market.
   John Greenwald, an attorney with the firm that conducted the
study, said negotiations between the two countries would eliminate
the need for lengthy and costly litigation involved in filing the
petitions.
   ``The white paper was prepared ... in hopes they would go to
Japanese government and say dumping is causing us problems, not
only in compact pickups but in other products, and preventing the
exchange-rate realignment from curing the trade deficit,''
Greenwald said.
   Automotive products account for about half of the nearly $60
billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan. Greenwald said continued
dumping and denials of dumping would push the value of the dollar
down further against the yen.
   The MVMA study found the truck dumping prevented U.S. makers
from fully using factory space, from moving car workers to truck
production jobs instead of laying them off or from earning healthy
returns on production and sales of small pickups.
   It estimated the cost to the U.S. auto industry and its workers
at $500 million in lost wages, profits and sales.
   For example, according to the study, Toyota charges $3,988 at
the factory for a small pickup destined for the U.S. market and
$5,313 for the same truck destined for sale in its home market.
   The study's authors wrote that when the Japanese yen began to
appreciate against the dollar two years ago, the Japanese producers
lost the price advantage that had enabled them to undersell
American makers.
   ``Faced with the choice between surrendering the gains in import
levels or dumping, they decided to dump,'' the study said.
   The authors also called Japanese makers' response that the
dumping has caused no harm ``absurd.''

<HEAD>Volvo Buys British Leyland's Bus Division</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AB Volvo of Sweden announced that it
has bought the bus division of British Leyland, making the major
Scandinavian automaker a leading bus manufacturer in Western Europe.
   The purchase was announced Wednesday in London and Goteborg,
Sweden. Volvo acquired the bus division from Leyland's management,
which took over the company from state-owned Rover Group PLC in
January 1987.
   Under the deal, Volvo acquires Leyland's two plants in Farington
and Workington in northwestern England with a total of 1,850
employees. The plants make the well-known red double-decker buses.
   Volvo, Sweden's largest and most profitable industrial company
which has diversified into food and trading, has already taken over
General Motors Corp.'s truck division. Volvo's latest purchase
makes it the world's second- largest bus maker after Daimler-Benz
AG of West Germany.
   Volvo did not disclose the price it paid for Leyland's bus
division, which will boost Volvo's bus production by 40 percent, to
about 5,500 units a year. Volvo's bus output rose by 16 percent to
a record 3,920 units last year, hitting maximum capacity at its
main Swedish plant and a smaller facility in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
   The British bus subsidiary will continue to operate as an
independent entity although Volvo plans to build about 1,000 of its
own buses at the Leyland plants by 1990, a Volvo spokesman said.
   Volvo's main markets are Scandinavia, central Europe and South
America, while Leyland buses are mostly marketed in Britain and in
British Commonwealth countries.
   Volvo's bus division last year accounted for 2 billion Swedish
kronor, around $340 million, or only 2.2 percent of the company's
total sales of 92.5 billion kronor, or $15.7 billion. Leyland is
expected to show a small profit for 1987 on sales of roughly 1
billion kronor, or about $170 million.

   The stock market retreated today, yielding to
afternoon selling after an early advance faltered.
   Analysts noted that the dollar had shown signs of steadying in
foreign exchange, which sparked a rebound in bond prices in
Tuesday's activity.
   Wall Streeters were generally pleased with the government's
report Tuesday that the index of leading economic indicators rose
0.9 percent in February.
   That was taken as a signal that the economy was neither weak nor
dangerously strong.
   The market weakened as the session passed, however. Brokers said
traders seemed reluctant to hold onto big positions with a long
holiday weekend approaching.
   The market will be closed in observance of Good Friday. The
government is scheduled to report on the employment situation for
March that day, but stock and bond traders will have to wait until
Monday to respond to it if it contains any surprises.

<HEAD>Kodak Goes Through With Photofinishing Merger Despite Lawsuit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH PICHT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. and Fuqua Industries
Inc. said Wednesday they had combined their photofinishing
operations, although a lawsuit challenging the merger is still
being argued.
   Kodak and the Atlanta-based Fuqua wasted no time in completing
the deal Tuesday after the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New
Orleans reversed a lower court's injunction that had blocked the
merger since Feb. 22.
   Qualex Inc. combines Fuqua's photofinishing subsidiary,
Colorcraft Corp., with Kodak-owned laboratories, to form the
country's largest wholesale photofinishing operation. It has 94
processing labs around the country.
   Paul Allen, a Kodak spokesman, said the target date for the
merger had been Feb. 1.
   The Court of Appeals decided that Phototron Corp., a small San
Bernardino, Calif.-based photofinisher, had no right to try to
block the merger, although it may continue pursuing its lawsuit,
Allen said.
   Phototron sued Kodak over the photo giant's Colorwatch
photofinishing system, claiming it violates antitrust laws because
it is forcing non-Colorwatch processing labs out of business, said
Joseph Alioto, a Photron lawyer.
   Alioto said Phototron is seeking between $100 million and $150
million in damages because of Colorwatch. The merger, he said, will
just increase that range.
   Nonetheless, Alioto said Wednesday that he plans to ask the
Supreme Court to issue a temporary injunction preventing the merger
until he can file a request for the court to consider the matter.
   ``As far as we're concerned, the Supreme Court should get a look
at this thing prior to the scrambling of the eggs,'' Alioto said.
   As far as Kodak and Fuqua are concerned, the eggs have already
been scrambled.
   The company will be based in Durham, N.C., the home of
Colorcraft, and Colorcraft's former chairman, D. Carl Hamill, will
serve as chief executive officer.
   The lawsuit filed by Phototron is being heard in U.S. District
Court in Fort Worth, Texas, and is expected to continue regardless
of the status of the injunction blocking the merger.

   An afternoon round of selling sent stock prices
lower Wednesday after an early advance faltered.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 10 points

<HEAD>FTC Won't Block GE Bid For Roper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission has decided
not to intervene in General Electric Co.'s bid to acquire Roper
Corp., GE said in a brief statement Wednesday.
   GE is battling with Whirlpool Corp. for control of Roper, an
Augusta, Ga.-based appliance maker.
   GE's sweetened $54-a-share tender offer is valued at $507
million; Whirlpool is offering $470 million, or $50 a share.
   Roper's directors initially supported the Whirlpool offer, but
Tuesday urged stockholders to accept the GE offer.
   GE said in its statement that the FTC had decided not to block a
GE-Roper combination because of antitrust concerns.
   Roper employs about 4,750 people, 3,000 of them in four Georgia
plants. In addition to electric and gas appliances, the company
manufactures tillers, lawn mowers and lawn and garden tractors. Its
customers include Sears Roebuck & Co., the nation's largest
retailer.
   It also manufactures some gas ranges for GE, and the
Fairfield-based company has said its interest in Roper stems from
that association.

<TEXT>
   The rising British pound continued to take
center stage in foreign exchange Wednesday at the expense of the
dollar, which lost ground against most key currencies despite
reports of central bank intervention.
   Gold prices edged higher after falling overseas. Republic
National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $456.25 a troy ounce
as of 4 p.m. EST, up $1 from late Tuesday.
   Currency traders said the dollar was hurt by sterling's
strength, although it managed to gain some ground in Europe.
Trading was said to be generally quiet everywhere in anticipation
of the upcoming Easter and Passover holidays.
   British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, speaking to a
committee in Parliament, said Wednesday that the pound has moved
higher recently only as a result of tight monetary policy, not due
to an adjustment in any specific targeting by the government.
   One trader at a major British bank said such comments
represented ``nothing new, but it is taken as a confirmation'' the
government was unlikely to tamper with the pound in its current,
higher range and could allow it to appreciate further.
   ``Nigel Lawson implied ... that the rise in sterling was
something that was still in the spirit of the Louvre accord of
currency stabilization,'' said James T. McGroarty, a trader and
vice president at Discount Corp.
   ``The traders took that to mean that the (central) bank had
decided to let it go. I don't buy that. I think there may be some
action to slow the sterling's rise.''
   Still, many traders said that with Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, Bank of England Governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton and Lawson
backing a low-inflation stragtegy and paying less attention to the
pound, that currency could advance until the middle of next month.
   In London, the British pound jumped to $1.8790 from $1.8705
Tuesday. Sterling fetched $1.8780 in New York, up from 1.86425.
   Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 125.43 Japanese yen, up
from 124.37, but it fell in London to 124.75 yen.
   Traders said the Federal Reserve bought a small amount of
dollars and sold yen late Wednesday in New York. The dollar closed
at 125.025 yen, down from 125.255 yen.
   Other dollar rates late Wednesday in New York, compared with
late Tuesday, included: 1.66285 West German marks, down from
1.66925; 1.37215 Swiss francs, down from 1.37675; 1.23575 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.2360; 5.6330 French francs, down from 5.6505;
and 1,232.175 Italian lire, down from 1,236.
   Late rates in Europe compared with Tuesday's late rates: 1.6625
West German marks, up from 1.6610; 1.3732 Swiss francs, down from
1.3735; 5.6505 French francs, up from 5.6280; 1.2370 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.2363; and 1,235.50 Italian lire, up from
1,232.50.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery was bid at $457.80 a troy ounce, up $2.40 from late
Tuesday.
   Gold closed in London at $453.60 an ounce, down from $454.75
late Tuesday. The late bid price in Zurich was $454.50 an ounce,
down from $455.00. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $455.79 an
ounce, down from $456.88.
   On the New York Comex, silver bullion for current delivery was
bid at $6.757 a troy ounce, up from $6.705 late Tuesday. Silver
traded late in London at $6.65 an ounce, down from $6.69.

<HEAD>Platinum Futures Soar For Second Day On Strong Demand Prospects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Platinum futures prices soared Wednesday for the second
consecutive session on the New York Mercantile Exchange on rumors
of increased Japanese buying and an improving economic outlook.
   On other markets, copper and precious metals futures advanced;
energy futures were higher; livestock and meat prices retreated;
grains and soybeans were mixed; and stock-index futures fell back.
   Platinum settled $12.10 a troy ounce to $13.80 an ounce higher
on the Nymex with the contract for delivery in April at $532.50 an
ounce.
   Platinum prices have gained about $75 a troy ounce in the past
two months as economic data have increasingly dispelled fears of a
recession and pointed toward higher inflation.
   Gold prices have also advanced on inflation concerns but
platinum has an edge because of its strong industrial-use
component, analysts said.
   Although there was no fresh positive economic news on Wednesday,
rumors that Japanese firms planned to increase their purchases of
platinum gave the market a boost, said Stephen W. Platt, an analyst
in Chicago with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Heightened racial tensions in South Africa, the source of most
of the refined platinum on the market, also underpinned the rise in
prices, Platt said.
   Copper futures also posted strong gains Wednesday on New York's
Commodity Exchange, with the April contract settling 3.95 cents
higher at $1.0795 a pound.
   A sustained rally in industrial-metals prices likely would be
perceived as inflationary, which could push gold and silver prices
higher as well, said analyst Craig Sloane of Smith Barney, Harris
Upham & Co.
   On the Comex, gold settled $1.50 to $2.20 higher with April at
$457.80 a troy ounce; silver was 4.7 cents to 5.5 cents higher with
April at $6.757 a troy ounce.
   Unleaded gasoline led energy futures prices higher on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
   The buying stemmed from a strong increase in demand reflected by
Tuesday's weekly American Petroleum Institute report showing a
4.22-million-barrel drawdown in gasoline stocks to 230 million
barrels.
   ``That's 15.6 million barrels behind last year,'' said Andrew
Lebow, an analyst in New York with E.D.& F. Man International
Futures Inc. ``We're seeing very strong demand for gasoline and
that seems to be dragging the other markets up.''
   Lebow said higher speed limits have resulted in greater
consumption of gasoline. A sharp increase in wholesale demand in
the past two weeks may have reflected dealer stockpiling ahead of
the Easter-Passover weekend, he said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 11 cents
higher with May at $17.08 a barrel; heating oil was .32 cent to .45
cent higher with April at 48.60 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .11 cent to .53 cent higher with April at 48.65 cents a gallon.
   Cattle futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on
fears that consumer demand for beef will drop when recent price
increases in the cash cattle market reach grocery stores in the
form of higher beef prices, said Chuck Levitt, an analyst in
Chicago with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Pork futures prices fell as traders squared their positions
ahead of Thursday afternoon's 10-state hogs and pigs report from
the Agriculture Department, he said.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .62 cent lower with April at 75
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent to .78 cent lower with
March at 82.75 cents a pound; hogs were .58 cent lower to .07 cent
higher with April at 45.35 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
unchanged to .28 cent lower with May at 55.90 cents a pound.
   Wheat settled slightly higher on the Chicago Board of Trade
while corn and soybean prices retreated in light trading.
   Wheat was supported by expectations that the Soviet Union would
bid Thursday for 500,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat, analysts said.
Acceptance of the bid by the USDA would complete a Soviet purchase
of 1 million metric tons of wheat it was recently offered under the
USDA's Export Enhancement Program.
   The slight downward movement of soybeans and the other grains
reflected position-evening ahead of the USDA's Thursday afternoon
reports on spring planting intentions and U.S. grain stocks, said
Joel Karlin, research analyst for Research Department Inc. in
Chicago.
   Wheat settled { cent to 1\ cents higher with May at $3.02\ a
bushel; corn was 1\ cents to 2 cents lower with May at $2.09{ a
bushel; oats were 3 cents to 3} cents lower with May at $1.60 a
bushel; soybeans were 3 cents lower to { cent higher with May at
$6.49 a bushel.
   Stock-index futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled 1.7 points lower at 258.25. The underlying
spot index closed at 258.07, off 2 points.

   Texaco Inc. said it filed an appeal of a
multibillion-dollar damage judgment to the U.S. Supreme Court on
Wednesday, but stressed the move was only a formality in the event
its settlement with Pennzoil Co. fell through.
   Texaco agreed in December to pay Pennzoil $3 billion in return
for Pennzoil dropping the $10.3 billion judgment. The settlement
was the keystone of a bankruptcy reorganization plan that was
approved by a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge in White Plains, N.Y.,
last week.
   The plan is scheduled to take effect April 7, at which time
Texaco is to transfer $3 billion to Pennzoil and begin payment of
$2.6 billion to its other creditors. Texaco said it would withdraw
its request for a Supreme Court hearing at that time.
   Pennzoil won the judgment when a Houston jury ruled Texaco had
improperly interfered with a Pennzoil acquisition of part of Getty
Oil Co. and bought all of Getty itself.
   Texaco filed for bankruptcy court protection last April to avoid
having to pay a $11 billion security bond while appealing that
judgment.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said Wednesday
its fourth-quarter loss narrowed to $27.2 million in 1987 from
$65.9 million a year earlier as its revenue rose 23.9 percent.
   The broadcasting and sports company said revenue for the quarter
ended Dec. 31 rose to $193.1 million from $155.9 million a year
earlier.
   Operating income for the quarter more than doubled to $64.9
million from $27.4 million for the same quarter the previous year.
   The company said fourth quarter earnings included a charge of
$13.1 million to reduce the value of certain internally produced
programming to its estimated net realizable value. The earnings
also included a $10 million credit resulting from recognition of
copyright fee income which had been the subject of litigation.
   For the year ended Dec. 31, the company lost $131.2 million on
revenue of $652.4 million, compared to a net loss of $187.3 million
on revenue of $556.9 million for 1986.
   Operating income for the year climbed 69 percent to $217.4
million from $128.4 million a year earlier.

<TEXT>
   Spurred by greatly reduced minimum prices, 84
oil companies bid almost $593 million dollars Wednesday for leases
of federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico.
   Successful high bids totalled $404.6 million, according to
Eileen Angelico, spokeswoman for the Minerals Management Service of
the Interior Department.
   Atlantic Richfield Co. submitted the highest bid of any of the
companies _ $18.2 million for a single 5,000-acre block, identified
as West Cameron Block 248.
   Shell Offshore submitted the largest number of bids, 250, said
Angelico.
   Angelico said 931 bids on 684 different tracts had been
submitted for Wednesday's bid opening. A breakdown of how many
tracts were leased to each successful bidder was unavailable
Wednesday afternoon, she said.
   At a similar lease sale a year ago, about 300 bids were
received. Angelico the increase in bids was probably due in large
part to the Interior Department's drastic drop in the minimum price
per acre _ from $150 to $25.
   ``We think that helped the number of bids,'' said Angelico.
``One thing it did was provide an opportunity for more small
companies to compete in the sale.''
   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel said last month that the minimum
bid was dropped to stimulate interest in the lease sale during a
period of low oil prices.
   The lease sale was announced in February, when 6,265 unleased
blocks _ each about 5,000 acres _ went up for sale. The blocks are
anywhere from three miles to 220 miles offshore, Angelico said.

   Southland Corp., the parent company of 7-Eleven
convenience stores, on Wednesday reported a net loss of around $59
million for 1987 because of interest expenses and other costs
related to its leveraged buyout.
   However, the company said that in the seven months prior to
going private it earned $90.1 million on revenues of $4.9 billion.
Southland said it lost $149.7 million in the first five months of
its new operating structure.
   In 1986, Southland earned $200.4 million on revenues of $7.8
billion.
   ``Southland's operating performance for the year was quite
strong, especially considering that the company undertook the most
extensive reorganization and cost-reduction program in its history
during the fourth quarter,'' said Jere W. Thompson, Southland
president and chief executive officer.
   In December, Southland completed its $4.9 billion leveraged
buyout by merging with JT Acquisition Corp., an affiliate of the
Thompson Co., the investment firm of the founding family.
   In a leveraged buyout, a company is bought primarily with
borrowed funds that are repaid with funds generated by the acquired
company's operations or through asset sales.
   Southland owns about 7,000 7-Eleven stores and is the nation's
largest independent gasoline retailer with 50 percent interest in
Citgo Petroleum Corp.
   In reporting 1987 earnings, Southland divided the seven months
preceding the company's buyout and merger activities from the five
months at the end of the year.
   The company warned a clear comparison between the two earnings
periods is impossible because of the changed structure and
different accounting bases.
   Southland said it does not expect to report a net profit ``for
some time'' because of interest costs to service the LBO-related
debt and other factors.

<HEAD>Investor Files Class Action Suit Against First RepublicBank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York man is suing First RepublicBank Corp.,
accusing the financially troubled bank holding company of financial
misrepresentation, an attorney said Wednesday.
   Attorneys for Martin Theodores, a New York investor, filed the
suit in federal district court in Dallas on Tuesday.
   In the class action suit, Theodores seeks compensatory and
punitive damages, said James Malone, attorney in the Haverford, Pa.
firm of Greenfield and Chimicles, which is representing Theodores.
   Malone said the suit claims First RepublicBank inflated and
misstated the collectability and security of its assets.
   ``That has an overall effect of making the bank's balance sheets
and statements look better than they are,'' Malone said.
   Theodores' investment in First RepublicBank, which involved
about $5,000 to $10,000 in bonds, shrank as the company posted a
$656.8 million loss last year. But Malone says it is too early to
tell how much in damages will be sought.
   First RepublicBank had no comment on the suit and would not
discuss pending litigation, said spokesman Joe Bowles.
   First RepublicBank received a $1 billion loan from the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. earlier this month after asking the federal
insuror for advice on restructuring.

products and engineered materials.
   ``These actions will consolidate the company's efforts in those

   The board of directors of Harcourt Brace
Jovanovich Inc. on Wednesday elected Ralph D. Caulo as president
and chief operating officer and retained longtime HBJ boss William
Jovanovich as chairman and chief executive.
   Caulo, 53, had been one of several executive vice presidents who
constituted the office of president of the company, which has major
interests in publishing, theme parks and insurance.
   Caulo's new post indicates he will take over more of the
day-to-day operations, but officials of the Orlando-based company
either were unavailable or would not comment on a brief statement
issued after the directors' meeting. Caulo will continue to oversee
HBJ's textbook publishing and related operations, according to the
statement.
   Jovanovich, 68, has run the company since 1955 and there were no
indications that he was relinquishing any of his control.

<HEAD>Calmat Rejects $988 Million Brierly Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Calmat Co., a major cement supplier in
Western markets, said Wednesday its board has rejected as
inadequate an offer from investor Ronald Brierley to take the
company private for $40 a share.
   New Zealand-born Brierley already owns 19 percent of Calmat's
30.6 million shares, which values his bid at about $990 million for
the remainder. He controls two of the 15 seats on the company's
board.
   Calmat said its directors voted unanimously against the offer,
which Brierley made last week.
   Calmat rose 25 cents to $44 a share on the New York Stock
Exchange Wednesday, indicating investors expect the bidding to go
higher. The stock was trading at $31.875 a share before Brierley
made his offer a week ago.
   Calmat's chief executive, A.F. Gerstell, said the board decided
``a sale is not in the best interest at this time given efforts to
maximize shareholder values.''
   Two years ago Calmat embarked on a strategy to boost shareholder
value by selling unprofitable or marginally profitable assets and
concentrating instead on its high-margin operations.
   Gerstell said the plan has ``show substantial results, and we
expect continuing increases in value.''
   Previously, Gerstell has said that management is working with
its investment banker on ``additional, more aggressive steps the
company can take to continue this ongoing process.''
   Calmat's core businesses are in making cement, ready-mixed
concrete, aggregate and hot-mixed asphalt. It also has valuable
real estate holdings in California and Arizona.
   In 1986, the company netted $44.1 million on revenues of $619
million. In the first nine months of last year, it earned $78.1
million on sales of $658.9 million.
   Calmat was formed four years ago the merger of California
Portland Cement Co. and Conrock Co.

<HEAD>Prosecution Witnesses Say Penn Square Banker Broke Lending Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Penn Square Bank moved toward its 1982
collapse, top officials seemed bent on expanding its energy-loan
portfolio in a bid for growth that had ``no rhyme or reason,'' a
former vice president testified Wednesday.
   ``It appeared to be unrestrained growth for growth's sake,''
John Baldwin of Oklahoma City told a U.S. District Court jury.
   Baldwin's testimony focused on William Patterson, 37, who was in
charge of Penn Square energy loans when the Oklahoma City bank went
under.
   Patterson is one of three men being tried on charges of improper
loan activity that may have played a part in the near-collapse of
Chicago-based Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. in
1984.
   All have pleaded innocent.
   Federal officials have said Continental participated with Penn
Square in more than $1 billion in uncollectible loans _ most of
them energy loans. The Chicago bank was saved from collapse in 1984
by a $4.5 billion federal bailout.
   Baldwin testified Wednesday at Patterson should have been aware
of the bank's agreement not to sell off parts of loans that had
been questioned by federal bank examiners.
   Patterson violated the pact in 1982 by taking part in the sale
of at least $5 million in problem loans to Continental, he said.
   Baldwin also said Patterson didn't seem to care about
Continental's buying loans that carried inordinate risk, and was
concerned only with dumping the Penn Square energy loans on the
Chicago bank.
   The sales shifted virtually the entire burden of risk for those
loans to Continental.
   Defendant John R. Lytle, 52, of suburban Northfield, who once
headed Continental's Oklahoma oil and gas lending operation, is
accused of buying millions of dollars in poor-quality loans from
Penn Square in exchange for nearly $600,000 in personal, unsecured
loans.
   Patterson is accused of arranging the personal loans, which
prosecutors characterize as kickbacks.
   The third defendant, Tulsa drilling contractor Jere Sturgis, is
accused of making payments to Lytle in an attempt to obtain loans
from Continental.
   Prosecutors hope to show that Lytle knew or should have known he
was buying up problem loans for his bank, and that Patterson knew
he was dumping off a bad product on Lytle.
   Baldwin told the court that while he was at Penn Square, from
July 1981 through its closing, top bank officials seemed intent on
expanding their loans to independent oil and gas concerns.
   ``In my opinion, the bank's ... growth had no rhyme or reason to
it,'' he said, calling Penn Square ``severely understaffed.''
   Lawyers said they expected the trial, which began March 9 before
U.S. District Judge Milton Shadur, will last about three more weeks.

<HEAD>Barron Hilton Wins Key Ruling in Battle Over Father's Estate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hilton Hotels Corp. chairman and chief
executive Barron Hilton won a major court ruling Wednesday in a
nine-year legal battle over his father's estate.
   The court fight has, in effect, pitted Hilton against several
orders of Catholic nuns devoted to helping the poor who were
singled out as beneficiaries of the estate of the late Conrad
Hilton.
   The California Court of Appeal reversed Los Angeles County
probate judge's decision and concluded that a stock-purchase option
granted by the father to the son covers all 6.78 million of the
estate's shares. That is 27 percent of Hilton Hotel's shares.
   The stock was given to the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation after the
hotel magnate died in 1979 at age 91. The foundation's directors
were instructed by the elder Hilton's will to promote world peace
and ``shelter little children with the umbrella of your charity.''
   Nuns as far away as Italy were beneficiaries of the estate's
largesse.
   The father's will also gave Barron Hilton an option to buy stock
that couldn't be properly held by the foundation.
   The dispute centered on a 1969 Internal Revenue Service rule
prohibiting private foundations from owning more than 20 percent of
any public company.
   Barron Hilton claimed that since the rule was violated, he could
exercise his option to buy all the stock at $24 per share, or $163
million, its value at the time of his father's death.
   The stock today is worth about $598 million.
   To avoid the stock-ownership rule, the charitable foundation
reclassified itself as a public-support organization. Last April, a
probate judge ruled that action was proper and that the foundation
didn't need to divest itself of the stock.
   Barron Hilton appealed, resulting in Wednesday's ruling that
remanded the case to probate court to determine terms of selling
the stock to Barron Hilton, who now owns only about 4 percent of
the company.
   He said he was ``very pleased'' with the action, adding, ``It
validates the positon I have taken since my father's death, and I
regard this as a significant victory.''
   The head of hte foundation, Donald Hubbs, said he would meet
soon with the organization's directors ``to determine what action
to take, but I presume we will appeal to the California Supreme
Court.''

<HEAD>Judge Favors Batus in Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Batus Inc.'s challenge of a 19-year-old Nevada
law in its hostile $4.5 billion bid for Farmers Insurance Group was
upheld Wednesday by a judge who labeled the law unconstitutional.
   Batus has offered $63 for each of Farmers' outstanding shares.
In over-the-counter trading Wednesday, Farmers closed at $58.12{,
down $1.37{.
   U.S. District Court Judge Howard McKibben said that the law,
which allows stockholders only 60 days to decide whether to sell
their shares in a tender offer, violates the Constitution.
   Batus argued the Nevada law conflicts with the federal Williams
Act, which gives shareholders the right to participate in tender
offers at will. ``The investors ultimately suffer because they they
are required to deposit shares within the 60-day period without
complete information on regulatory approvals,'' McKibben wrote in
his ruling.
   Los Angeles-based Farmers has been resisting takeover overtures
by Batus since January. Batus is the American subsidiary of
London-based BAT Industries Inc. PLC.
   BAT is a tobacco, retailing and paper-goods conglomerate that
for some time has been seeking a foothold in the U.S. financial
services market.
   Farmers, with about $11 billion in assets, is the nation's third
largest home and auto insurer, and the seventh largest property and
casualty insurer.
