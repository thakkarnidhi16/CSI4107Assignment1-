   A businessman defeated a city planner Tuesday in
a Republican primary runoff for the right to challenge Democratic
Rep. George ``Buddy'' Darden, while a late-breaking campaign
financing controversy complicated another state race.
   According to unofficial returns from all 207 precincts, Robert
Lamutt of Cobb County had 6,220 votes, or 52 percent, to 5,691, or
48 percent, for Kevin Johns, a Roswell planner.
   The two were the surviving candidates for the GOP's 7th District
nomination after the primary election three weeks ago. The race was
thrown into a runoff when neither could claim a majority.
   Darden was unopposed in the Democratic congressional primary.
   In Georgia's only statewide primary runoff, former state Sen.
Bobby Rowan won the Democratic nomination for a seat on the
utility-regulating Public Service Commission Tuesday after a bitter
fight with state Rep. Cathey Steinberg.
   According to unofficial returns from 2,290 of the 2,569
precincts, Rowan had 216,321, or 55 percent, to Ms. Steinberg's
176,175, or 45 percent.
   While polls were still open, a transcript unsealed in federal
court indicated Georgia Power Co. supervisors and managers were
pressured to make contributions to Rowan.
   Utility officials said that would violate ``a very important
policy'' of the company, and Rowan called the allegations
``reckless and unfounded.''
   In a mid-evening telephone interview after the contest appeared
concluded, Rowan refused to say he would decline future
contributions from sources with power company interests.
   ``If I go on the commission, we ought to talk about what we're
going to do about this,'' he said. ``I shouldn't try to stand out
as an island by myself.''
   Ms. Steinberg said, ``I'm not going to win; the utilities are
going to win. My opponent beat me to death with a money bag.''
   She said Rowan distorted her legislative record in ads aired
throughout the state and described the campaign as ``very nasty.''

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A military official said Tuesday that
renegade soldiers loyal to ousted President Ferdinand Marcos have
organized a new strike force to try to topple President Corazon
Aquino.
   Col. Guilleromo Ruiz, chief of staff of the National Capital
Region Defense Command, told reporters in the capital that the new
group called itself ``Marcos Army Lost Command.''
   Ruiz said the force was made up of troops who deserted the
Presidential Security Command after Marcos fled to Hawaii after the
1986 civilian-military uprising toppled his administration.
   ``Lost Command'' is a Filipino term for military units which
desert and hire out as ``private armies'' of politicians,
businessmen and others.
   Military officials gave no estimate of the size of the group.
They said the renegades were believed linked to forces loyal to
renegade former Lt. Col. Reynaldo Cabauatan, who has been sought
since a coup attempt in January 1987.
   Troops in the Manila area went on alert Saturday to guard
against coup attempts while President Aquino visited Brunei. She
was expected to return Wednesday after a three-day visit.
   On Monday, troops raided suspected right-wing hideouts in the
Manila area and arrested three renegades believed linked to former
Brig. Gen. Jose Marie Zumel. The former superintendent of the
Philippine Military Academy is also sought in the January 1987 coup
attempt.
   The government said that coup attempt, which included the
seizing of military and media facilities in the capital, was
designed to pave the way for Marcos to return from exile in Hawaii.

<HEAD>Fuel Leak Spurs Evacuation Of Launch Pad For Classified Titan
Flight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaking rocket fuel
forced the evacuation of a Titan 2 launch pad during the weekend,
the Air Force said Tuesday.
   The Air Force declined to confirm whether the mishap Sunday
delayed the classified launch of four Navy spy satellites.
   John Pike, a space policy expert at the Washington-based
Federation of American Scientists, said last week that a classified
Titan 2 launch was expected soon.
   He said the one-time intercontinental ballistic missile, in its
maiden flight as a space booster, was almost certain to carry into
orbit a set of four White Cloud Navy Ocean Surveillance System
satellites designed to eavesdrop on radio and radar transmissions
by the Soviet fleet.
   The Air Force and Martin Marietta Corp. have previously said
that Space Launch Complex 4 West will be used to launch refurbished
Titan 2s carrying military payloads.
   ``We had a minor vapor escape of monomethyl hydrazine at Space
Launch Complex 4 West this weekend,'' said Capt. John Sullivan, a
spokesman for the Air Force Space and Missile Test Organization at
this military base 140 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
   ``The leak was detected by our sensors and the pad was evacuated
with our safety procedures,'' he added. ``The vapor dispersed
harmlessly into the atmosphere. At no time was there any danger to
the base or community population'' in nearby Vandenberg Village or
the neighboring city of Lompoc.
   Sullivan emphasized the leak wasn't serious, but said he didn't
know how many people were evacuated from the launch pad.
   He also declined comment on whether a Titan 2 was being loaded
with the hydrazine fuel to prepare it for a classified launch.
   For about 25 years, Titan 2 rockets served as ICBMs, each
carrying a nine-megaton hydrogen warhead. Maintenance and safety
problems spurred removal of the obsolete missiles from their silos
in Arkansas, Kansas and Arizona.
   The Air Force has ordered 13 Titan 2s reconditioned as space
boosters under a $528.9 million contract with Martin Marietta
because it was cheaper than building new rockets.

   The latest ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' movie
retained first place in box office revenues last weekend, while
``Betrayed,'' about white supremacists in the United States, made
its debut in second place.
   ``Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master'' earned $6.9
million last weekend. ``Betrayed,'' the Costa-Gavras directed
thriller, took in more than $5.5 million.
   Two other movies made debuts in the top 10, with ``Stealing
Home'' coming in ninth and ``Hot To Trot'' finishing 10th.
   ``A Fish Called Wanda'' moved to third place from fourth last

<HEAD>Farmers' 1989 Income Forecast Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department says there is some
likelihood that farmers' net cash income in 1989 will drop from
this year's level, even if there are drought-busting rains and
production increases.
   According to the department's Economic Research Service,
production expenses ``may increase substantially'' in calendar
1989, judging from what has happened after previous droughts and an
expected boost in plantings as a result of relaxed acreage
set-aside requirements.
   ``As in the second half of 1988, higher feed prices will affect
1989's costs,'' the agency said in a new outlook report. ``Higher
prices for feeder cattle likely will help boost livestock incomes.
For crops, bigger planted acreage will boost expenditures for seed,
fertilizer, chemical and fuels.''
   The report in the September issue of Agricultural Outlook
magazine by economists Richard Kodl and Andrew Bernat said 1988 net
cash farm income is expected to be in the range of $55 billion to
$60 billion, near last year's record of $57.1 billion.
   They offered no specific figure for 1989 income.
   Bernat said Monday that the first official projections for 1989
farm income won't be made until November but that ``we thought it
would add something'' to the report by including some of the
factors down the road.
   As used by the agency, net cash income in a calendar year is the
difference between gross cash income _ which includes government
payments in addition to farm sales receipts _ and cash expenses.
   The economists noted that higher prices for some commodities hit
hard by drought have more than offset losses due to drought, on a
national scale. The rub is that only those farmers whose crops were
not hurt severely are able to benefit from the higher prices,
unless they hold inventories from earlier harvests.
   For 1988, crop sales receipts are forecast at $66 billion to $68
billion, up from $59 billion in 1987 and reversing two years of
decline, the report said. Livestock receipts this year may be in
the range of $77 billion to $79 billion, compared with $77 billion
in 1987.
   ``Consistent with recent droughts, this year's livestock
receipts will probably be relatively stable,'' the report said.
``This year's smaller cattle herd appears to limit cullings, thus
preventing substantial price weakening.''
   The report added: ``Also contributing to lower-than-expected
cullings is the fact that the five largest cattle-producing states
(Texas, Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Oklahoma) have not been as
hard hit by the drought as many other states.''
   Crop deficiency payments to farmers are declining as a result of
higher market prices, with the greatest effects likely in 1989.
Also, if a large portion of the $3.9 billion drought emergency
payments authorized recently go to farmers by the year's end, that
will mean further 1989 reductions in benefits.
   ``Following the drought, next year's crop prices may remain
higher, and crop production will increase,'' the report said.
``This would boost total cash receipts. However, it seems unlikely
that revenue gains will compensate for reduced federal supports and
higher operating costs.''

   Fed by what appears to be another bumper
cotton crop in the making, the U.S. supply could be pushed to a
22-year high in 1988-89, according to Agriculture Department
analysts.
   Based on Aug. 1 indications, the cotton harvest could be 14.9
million bales, up from 14.8 million bales last year. The increase
would result from a larger acreage this year, despite a reduction
in per-acre yields.
   In all, counting cotton left over from previous harvests, the
total 1988-89 supply will be about 20.5 million bales, the most
since the 1966-67 season, the department's Economic Research
Service said Monday.
   Because domestic and export use is not keeping pace with
production, the U.S. cotton stockpile when the next marketing year
begins on Aug. 1, 1989, could rise to 8.9 million bales from an
estimated carryover of 5.6 million bales this Aug. 1, the agency
reported.
   Meanwhile, world cotton production in 1988-89 is expected to
rise to nearly 86 million bales, up 7 percent from last season.
Foreign production, at about 71 million bales, is expected to gain
5 million bales, including record crops in India, Greece, Turkey
and Australia.
   World cotton consumption, forecast at nearly 83 million bales,
will about match last season, the report said. Cotton use is
expected to increase primarily among producing countries, while
falling among importers.
   As a result, world cotton stocks are expected to increase nearly
9 percent in 1988-89 to more than 35 million bales by the end of
the season. All of the buildup will occur in the United States,
while foreign inventories are expected to decline 2 percent.
   The report said U.S. cotton ``has not been priced competitively
in world markets for several months'' and that reduced export
sales, along with large crops last year and in 1988 translate into
the rise in inventories.

<HEAD>Air Force Seeks Cuts in Shuttle Launch Witnesses</HEAD>

   The Air Force says safety concerns prompted
its request that NASA cut back drastically on the number of people
allowed on a close-in press site to cover next month's launch of
space shuttle Discovery.
   In the past, there have been as many as 3,500 people on the
press mound during a launch at Cape Canaveral, Fla., said William
Sheehan, chief spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. NASA already has processed 2,600 news media
applications for the Discovery launch.
   Sheehan declined to specify the number the Air Force wants to
allow, but the number circulating around the Kennedy Space Center
in Florida is 100 _ including NASA public affairs personnel. Those
excluded would be allowed back onto the press site soon after the
shuttle lifts off.
   As discussions with the Air Force continued, top NASA managers
met Monday and decided not to set a specific launch date until
after a detailed preparedness review on Sept. 13-14. NASA has been
working toward a liftoff of the first post-Challenger mission in
the last week of September.
   The Air Force, which has jurisdiction over safety at NASA's
Kennedy facility, is worried about flying shrapnel should one of
the solid rocket boosters explode.
   ``They are asking us `what are the minimum numbers you can have
there and still be able to operate effectively?''' Sheehan said. He
said 6,000 to 7,000 space center workers not involved with the
shuttle on the pad also might be barred for some period preceding
launches.
   The press site and NASA's huge vehicle assembly building are 4.2
miles from pad 34-B. Reporters have been there for every launch
beginning with the Apollo program in 1967.
   ``They have some real basis for concern,'' Sheehan said. ``It
came about because of what they learned after the Challenger
(accident) and what they learned from the Atlas that had to be
destroyed.
   ``What they learned is you can't predict where it's going to go.
It can go down, it can go forward, it can go up.''
   After the Challenger shuttle was engulfed in flames 73 seconds
after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986, killing its crew of seven, the
Challenger's booster rockets careened about over the Atlantic for
another minute before they were destroyed by a command from the Air
Force safety officer.
   In March 1987, an Atlas Centaur rocket had to be destroyed 51
seconds into its flight when it started to tumble. No one on the
ground was injured in either incident.
   Before Challenger, Sheehan said, engineers assumed the booster
rockets would continue on the same path if they were released
during flight, perhaps tumbling.
   ``The detonation of the SRB is not as clean as everyone thought
it was,'' he said. ``It breaks apart at different times and has
debris as large as an automobile and as small as a piece of small
shrapnel. The issue concerns the spread of debris and the
fragmentation of the SRB when it disintegrates.''

<TEXT>
   The man who would be president came to
the shores of Pontoosuc Lake with a mission, and a rather large
following.
   The housing development here was one stop Monday for Michael
Dukakis on a nostalgic trip with all the trappings of a
gubernatorial re-election campaign: talk of the rebound from
double-digit unemployment, plans to convert an abandoned mill into
a major art museum, and praise of partnership after partnership
that has spurred western Massachusetts' sudden resurgence.
   It was the sixth such annual visit for Dukakis, but this time
things are a bit different: he's running for president, not
governor.
   While George Bush and running mate Dan Quayle denounce Dukakis
as soft on crime and weak on defense while questioning his
patriotism, Dukakis has spent two days in each of the past three
weeks touring his home state talking about home ownership, health
care, economic development and drunken driving. Those are all
important issues, to be sure, but such talk has for the most part
been lost in the aggressive tone of the early campaign.
   On Monday, for example, Bush toured a Missouri defense plant and
characterized Dukakis as opposed to every modern weapon system
``since the slingshot.''
   Dukakis was here at a lakefront housing development, touting his
Homeownership Opportunity Program, which made it possible for
moderate-income families to buy their first homes in an area that
otherwise would have been out of their price range.
   This at a time when Dukakis is being criticized for allowing his
presidential campaign to lose its edge, and Bush to surge ahead in
the polls.
   ``I am the sitting governor of this state and I've got to do my
job,'' was Dukakis' straight answer to a simple question: What was
he doing here?
   There were complaints from Dukakis aides that his message was
being obscured by coverage of the attacks on Dukakis by Bush and
the controversy over the Quayle selection.
   ``It's been a little difficult to get through,'' Dukakis said in
a huge understatment.
   But the problems aren't all the doings of Bush and the media's
Quayle hunt.
   Dukakis has offered few new national ideas during his regional
trips at home and has focused most of his dicussion on state
programs.
   Many of these initiatives, in fact, are models for the nation,
used as examples in shaping congressional proposals ranging from
the National Economic Development Act to major welfare reform.
   And had these trips come at another time, Dukakis might get out
of them what his campaign wants: media coverage of some of his most
successful programs, several of which he touts almost daily when
campaigning for the presidency.
   But with Bush and Quayle criss-crossing the country pushing
their agenda and slamming Dukakis, his attempt to talk about
public-private partnership, health care and jobs _ to bring the
campaign, in Dukakis' words, ``up where it belongs'' _ has been
frustrating.
   Bush, for sure, hasn't faced any questions, or protests, lately
over the Route 7 interchange proposal here in Pittsfield. But
opponents of the plan to widen the rural highway from two lanes to
four at the cost of more than 20 homes turned out Monday.
   Dukakis appears undaunted by the recent criticism, much of which
has come from the large media contigent he has brought with him to
Pittsfield this week, Lawrence last week and Worcester the week
before.
   ``I am a sitting governor and I do have a responsibility to the
citizens of this state,'' he told curious reporters Monday.
   But his post-Labor Day schedule will have him in Massachusetts
less frequently and his only remaining regional visit _ to
southeastern Massachusetts _ is scheduled for just one day.
   None of the criticism of the backyard stumping has been lost on
Dukakis, who was perhaps mindful of it when he delivered this
promise Monday: ``The dog days of August are almost over.''

   Americans are giving less to the two major
political parties, and Republicans hold a smaller fund-raising lead
over Democrats than before, the Federal Election Commission says.
   The FEC said in a report released Monday that contributions to
five fund-raising committees operated by each party totaled some
$226 million during the first 18 months of the 1987-88 election
cycle.
   That was well below the $267 million the 10 committees took in
during the corresponding period in 1983-84 when Ronald Reagan was
heading for a second term as president.
   The $226 million also was about $1 million below the combined
take for the first 18 months of the 1985-86 cycle, a
non-presidential election period when contributions usually are
less than in presidential years.
   The FEC said contributions to the five GOP committees totaled
$166.19 million during the 18 months ending June 30, compared with
$59.84 million raised by the five Democratic counterparts in the
same period.
   That left the Republicans in front by $106.35 million, but their
lead was smaller than the $152.7 million bulge during the
corresponding period in 1985-86 and the $147.85 million advantage
for the first three quarters of the 1983-84 election cycle.
   The Federal Election Commission report covered the finances of
the Democratic and Republican national committees; their House and
Senate campaign committees; their national convention funds; and
their state-local finance committees.
   The Republican National Committee saw its 1987-88 receipts fall
to $61.58 million, the lowest point for a similar 18-month period
during the Reagan presidency. Corresponding figures were $64.16
million in 1985-86, $75.23 million in 1983-84 and $65.75 million in
1981-82.
   Kathryn Murray, the committee's communications director, blamed
the falloff on poor response to the GOP's direct-mail solicitations
in the first and second quarters of 1987.
   During this period, the scandals that rocked the television
evangelists hurt direct-mail appeals by the GOP and a variety of
non-political fund-raisers, according to Murray.
   She said that since then, contributions have picked up, with the
second quarter of this year running second only to a three-month
period in 1984.
   The National Republican Senatorial Committee and National
Republican Congressional Committee, which support GOP candidates in
races for Congress, also showed lower receipts in the first 18
months of this election cycle.
   The Senate committee reported contributions of $42.3 million,
down from a 1980s high of $65.81 million in 1985-86. The House
apparatus had receipts of $21.32 million, nearly half the $41.96 it
had in the first 18 months of the 1983-84 cycle.
   On the Democratic side, contributions to the five entities in
the current cycle were only about $98,000 above where they were at
the same period in the last presidential cycle.
   The Democratic National Committee, which relies less than its
Republican counterpart on direct-mail solicitations, had receipts
of $16.85 million, down from the $29.76 million taken in during
1983-84.
   This drop, however, was offset by increased giving to the
Democrats' House and Senate committees and their committees for
state and local party affairs.
   The Senate panel received $11.42 million, compared with a
previous high of $7.56 million in 1985-86. The House panel was at
$9.45 million, up from $8.74 million in 1985-86. The state-local
share was $12.64 million, compared with a previous high of $10.97
million in 1983-84.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities were mixed in the latest auction, with rates on
three-month bills rising to the highest level in more than three
years but rates on six-month bills edging down.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.0 billion in three-month bills
Monday at an average discount rate of 7.26 percent, up from 7.18
percent last week. Another $7.0 billion was sold in six-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.50 percent, down from 7.51 percent
last week.
   The rates on three-month bills were the highest Aug. 5, 1985,
when they sold for 7.30 percent. Six-month bill rates were the
lowest since Aug. 8, when they averaged 7.26 percent.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 7.50 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,816.50 and 7.90 percent for six-month bills selling for
$9,620.80.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making
changes in adjustable rate home mortgages, rose to 8.28 percent
last week after averaging 8.27 percent the week before.

   A moose, bear and ranger dash
around the flames in Yellowstone National Park. ``Would the last
one out of the park please put the fire out!''
   So says one of the T-shirts Sheila Hanna sells to tourists
looking in the Wild West Mercantile for a memento of Yellowstone
National Park's unprecedented 1988 fire season.
   The ``fire shirts,'' as Hanna calls them, are among the few good
things to come out of Yellowstone's wildfires, which have blackened
more than 450,000 of the park's 2.2 million acres during the past
two months.
   One T-shirt's design carries a map of the park with the various
fires pinpointed in fire-engine red.
   Another portrays a Yellowstone entrance sign with a sketch of
Old Faithful geyser, whose upper reaches have been transformed from
steam into flame.
   ``We'd been asked if we had anything before we had any,'' Hanna
said Sunday. ``It's worked out pretty well,''
   Up the street from Hanna's store, Merle Adams' Savage Shop also
has found a steady demand for fire shirts.
   One he offers portrays a bear lounging at the mouth of a cave,
bone _ human, presumably _ in paw, saying, ``Send more
firefighters, the last ones were delicious!''
   ``Everybody always thought that the park's fires would deter
them (tourists),'' said Hanna, pressing a ``Wildfires 1988'' logo
onto a cap. ``But I think it brings more people. A national
disaster. Everybody's been coming to see Yellowstone National Park
on fire.''

<HEAD>Chris' Remants Trigger Flood Watches</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts one graf after 1st to UPDATE with New York storm.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   People in four states were alerted to the possibility of flash
flooding Monday after heavy rains and gusty winds hit the Northeast
in the wake of Tropical Storm Chris.
   A storm in metropolitan New York City uprooted trees, cut power
to nearly 30,000 customers in five counties and caused train
delays, according to electric companies. A large oak tree fell on a
car, killing a woman in suburban Mamaroneck, police said.
   A low pressure center crossing the middle Atlantic Coast region
and remnants of Chris helped showers and thunderstorms develop
along a slow-moving cold front in the northeastern states.
   Strong winds were reported near the center of the low pressure
system. Wind gusts to 50 mph in the Washington, D.C., area caused
some property damage late Monday morning. In the afternoon, wind
gusts to 55 mph were reported at Baltimore and up to 48 mph at
Wilmington, Del.
   Up to 5 inches of rain fell in north-central Pennsylvania and up
to 4{ inches at Lyndonville, Vt.
   Flood watches were in effect Monday night in southern Vermont,
western Massachusetts, the Susquehanna region of eastern
Pennsylvania and in New York state in the Catskills, the Mohawk
Valley, the Adirondacks and the entire Hudson Valley.
   Rain fell from northern Virginia to Maine and from the lower
Great Lakes to Tennessee Monday afternoon. Showers and
thunderstorms were scattered from the southern Atlantic Coast to
the western Gulf Coast, with a few showers over the upper Great
Lakes, the southern Plains and the Pacific Northwest.
   Temperatures warmed into the 90s across parts of Georgia,
Florida and southern Texas by early afternoon. Readings were in the
60s and upper 50s in the northern Atlantic Coast region, the upper
Ohio Valley, the Great Lakes region, the upper Mississippi Valley,
the southern high Plains and the southern Rockies.
   Both the high and low temperatures in the nation at 3 p.m. EDT
were in California, with 54 degrees at Arcata and 100 degrees at
Lemoore. The nation's low Monday morning was 29 degrees at Jackson,
Wyo.
   The forecast for Tuesday called for showers and thunderstorms
over the Atlantic Coast states, the central Gulf Coast states,
southern Texas, the southern Rockies and the southern Plateau
region. Showers and thunderstorms were expected to be most numerous
from northern Arizona to southern New Mexico, along the Louisiana
coast and from eastern North Carolina to southern New England. A
few showers were expected in the upper Great Lakes region. Sunny
skies were expected for the rest of the nation.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 70s and upper 60s from
the middle and northern Atlantic Coast to Illinois and Minnesota.
Highs were predicted in the 80s elsewhere east of the Rockies, with
lower 90s in the northern high Plains and over Florida. Highs in
the 80s and lower 90s were expected in the Western states, with 100
degrees in the deserts of southern California and southwestern
Arizona and afternoon highs in the 70s along the Pacific Coast.

   Pop singer Michael Jackson was given an
ovation by 90,000 people who showed up at a park in this northern
England industrial city for a concert on his 30th birthday.
   The crowd sang ``Happy birthday'' Monday night and Jackson
replied simply, ``Thank you.''
   No fanfare, no gifts and no birthday cake, in keeping with
remnants of Jackson's earlier Jehovah's Witnesses religious
beliefs, tour spokesman Bob Jones said.
   Police described the event as ``very successful'' from their
point of view, with only 96 arrests, most for drunkenness, damage
and drug offenses.
   All 90,000 tickets for the concert were sold months ago and the
most serious injury reported was a broken leg suffered by a man as
ticketless fans tried to enter the arena.
   Leeds was the latest stop on Jackson's 43-date European concert
tour.

   Fred MacMurray will be surrounded by the
women of his life at a small gathering to celebrate his 80th
birthday today.
   On hand will be his wife of 34 years, former actress June Haver,
the couple's twin 32-year-old daughters, Kate and Laurie, and his
two dogs, also females.
   ``He's the father of `My Three Sons' but he's surrounded by
females,'' his wife said Monday during a telephone interview.
MacMurray, who is recovering from a stroke, was asleep and couldn't
come to the phone, she said.
   MacMurray has been encouraged by an outpouring of get-well
cards, letters and flowers, she said.
   ``If life begins at 40, he's only 40,'' she said. ``He's very
happy to be 80 years old. Many of his friends are older, you know.
He looks at George Burns (92) and Bob Hope (85) and he says, `Gee,
I feel like a kid.'''

   Jessica Hahn, the church secretary whose night
with TV evangelist Jim Bakker led to his downfall, launched her
radio career here to mixed reviews.
   Jay Stevens, KOY-FM's program director, said listener response
to Ms. Hahn's first day Monday was all positive.
   But Bud Wilkinson, radio-television critic for The Arizona
Republic, writing for today's editions, said that ``as an air
talent, Hahn isn't a sleeper, a wit awaiting harvest, but rather a
bust.''
   The station said Ms. Hahn, 29, was signed to a 30-day contract
with options for renewal.
   Ms. Hahn became an overnight celebrity in 1987 when revelations
about her sexual liaison with Bakker led to his giving up his PTL
empire. She later sold her story to Playboy, posed nude for the
publication and moved into the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles.

Convention in Atlanta, his spokeswoman said.
   Paulsen, 61, and Chaney, 35, exchanged vows in a July 20 civil
ceremony at Fulton County Courthouse, spokeswoman Marianne Jasin
said Monday.
   The Paulsens, in Atlanta for the convention, wanted to keep the
ceremony a secret at the time, but ``about a month later, they
thought they should release the news,'' Jasin said.
   The couple met five years ago at a comedy club here. Three years
later, she took over his bookings.
   In September, Paulsen, the perennial presidential candidate, is
scheduled to begin work on the CBS television show ``The Smothers
Brothers Comedy Hour,'' Jasin said.
   The marriage is the second for Paulsen and the first for his new
wife. Paulsen has three grown children.

   Irving Fryar, the often troubled
New England Patriots wide receiver, got a break when police pulled
him over for speeding.
   Police clocked Fryar at 55 mph in a 45 mph zone early Monday.
Fryar, 26, could have been arrested for driving without a valid
license but instead received a citation for speeding and driving
with a suspended license, said Police Chief Erving Lothrop.
   Fryar's license was suspended for failure to pay a $20 fine for
a minor driving offense, officials said.
   In February, New Jersey police charged Fryar with unlawful
possession of a gun, shotgun and hollow-point bullets after
stopping him for speeding. The weapons charges later were dropped.
   Fryar missed the Patriots' 1985 AFC championship game with the
Miami Dolphins after receiving a deep knife wound in his hand
during an argument with his wife. Two weeks later, Fryar was one of
six Patriots named as being treated for drug abuse during the 1985
season.

   Former major-league baseball player
John C. Ellis must forfeit his 12-foot boat as part of a special
probation he received on lobster-poaching charges.
   Ellis, who played for the New York Yankees, Cleveland Indians
and Texas Rangers in a 13-year career that ended in 1981, didn't
have to enter a plea Monday under the special program for
first-time offenders. The charges, which could have drawn three
years imprisonment and an $8,800 fine, will be stricken from
records if he successfully completes probation.
   Ellis and his brother-in-law were arrested July 28 by state
agents on Long Island Sound near Old Saybrook.
   Under an agreement with prosecutors, Ellis, a partner in a New
London real estate firm, also will pay $1,500 to a state program
designed to fight poachers.
   ``Certainly I think that the disposition of the case is
satisfactory to everybody involved,'' Ellis, 39, said after the
hearing in Middletown Superior Court.

   They got married and re-scheduled the honeymoon to start Monday.
   But Gov. Henry Bellmon called the Legislature back into special

   A pair of entrepreneurs turned
rejection into a profitable business venture by creating a
fraternity that anybody can join, even women, and everybody is
president.
   ``Fraternities are elitist organizations,'' said Ronald
Southwick, cofounder of Sigma Phi Nothing. ``We feel that everyone
should be special.''
   Southwick, 24, his 21-year-old partner, Joe Toth, launched Sigma
Phi Nothing after an unhappy rush week at one of Michigan State
University's fraternity houses.
   ``I got in and Joe didn't and that kind of upset us both. So I
decided not to join,'' Southwick said.
   Later, they figured, the rejection signified nothing, sparking
the Sigma Phi Nothing idea.
   So the two invented their own fraternity, created a logo, and
held a ``Don't rush, relax'' party. They brought 48 Sigma Phi
Nothing T-shirts, which quickly were sold at $10 a shirt.
   As their story spread, they sold more than 300 shirts in a few
weeks.
   Then a marketing company expressed interest in selling the
fraternity idea nationwide. The two have spent the summer
developing plans for selling the T-shirts at Big Ten schools this
fall.
   So far, the fledgling company has expanded its inventory to
include sweatshirts, corduroy caps and bumper stickers. And the
T-shirt price has risen to $11.
   The two budding businessmen, meanwhile, are taking some time off
from Michigan State to pursue their fraternity.

   A current Beach Boys hit extols ``Kokomo''
as a tropical paradise, which makes sense only after you learn the
group had never heard of the land-locked Indiana city.
   Beach Boys fans looking for ``bodies in the sand'' and a
``tropical drink melting in your hand'' won't find it in the
real-life Kokomo, an auto industry town about 50 miles north of
Indianapolis.
   The Beach Boys _ Mike Love, Carl Wilson, Al Jardine and Bruce
Johnston _ performed at the Indiana State Fair on Friday night.
There, they learned Kokomo does exist somewhere else besides in
their song.
   ``Kokomo'' is one cut on the soundtrack to the Tom Cruise movie
``Cocktail.'' The soundtrack went gold last Tuesday, having sold
half a million copies. The ``Kokomo'' single, released about eight
weeks ago, is climbing the adult-contemporary chart, reaching No.
11 this week.
   The Beach Boys said they thought they were singing of a
make-believe place.
   ``It was just a made-up ... it was a nice-sounding name,'' Love
said. ``The writer is John Phillips (of Mamas and Papas fame). He
started it and it wouldn't stop; it was out of control.''

   The Electoral College on Monday ended a
23-hour session by approving the last of 300 congressmen elected
directly to the Chamber of Deputies during balloting in July that
the opposition says was fraudulent.
   The body then postponed until Tuesday night its certification of
the elections of 200 other deputies assigned to the different
parties according to a proportional representation formula.
   The Electoral College, made up of the newly elected members of
the Chamber of Deputies, began its marathon session at 1 p.m.
Sunday and ended it shortly after noon Monday.
   Protests from opposition parties, accusing the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, of fraud in
the July 6 elections, delayed the certification process.
   The delay raised the small possibility there would not be a
quorum for the opening session of Congress on Thursday and
threatened President Miguel de la Madrid's state of the nation
speech that day.
   Under the constitution, the president must attend the opening
session and by tradition that is when he delivers the state of the
nation address.
   If the PRI does not have the 251 seats for a majority in the
500-member Chamber of Deputies an opposition boycott could cancel
the session.
   The Electoral College began the certification process, seat by
seat, on Aug. 15 and in the results announed Monday the PRI won 235
of the 300 seats. The conservative National Action Party had 36 and
leftist parties backing presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas
received 29.
   An earlier official vote count by the Federal Election
Commission gave the PRI 247 seats in the 500 member chamber and
opposition parties 227 with 26 in dispute.
   The PRI has dominated Mexican politics since 1929 and this year
for the first time it will not have the two-thirds majority
required to amend the constitution.
   Opposition parties claim the Election Commission has not
released results from about 25,000 polling places. They say those
would show that Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the PRI presidential
candidate, did not win the 50.36 percent of the vote awarded him in
official results.
   Cardenas received 31.12 percent of the vote in the official
results and Manuel J. Clouthier, the candidate of the National
Action Party, 17.07 percent.
   In early September the Electoral College of the Chamber of
Deputies is to confirm Salinas as president-elect.
   The Senate's Electoral College has finished certifying all its
members. Parties backing Cardenas won four of the 64 seats, marking
the first time the PRI had lost any seats in the upper house.

   The Reagan administration is abandoning
efforts to get the Palestine Liberation Office kicked out of
offices at the United Nations in New York, while continuing to
fight any attempt to reopen a PLO office in Washington, the Justice
Department says.
   The Reagan administration, following what one source described
as a bitter internal fight over the PLO issue, decided not to
appeal a judge's ruling that allowed the PLO to maintain its U.N.
office.
   A year-old law had ordered the administration to close PLO
facilities in both New York and Washington, but U.S. District Judge
Edmund L. Palmieri on June 29 struck down the provision regarding
the U.N. office, saying obligations to the international body took
precedence.
   Monday was the deadline for appealing Palmieri's order.
   The Justice Department said the decision not to fight Palmieri's
order ``was based on a determination that, on balance, the
interests of the United States are best served by not appealing.''
   The department said its ``normal policy'' was to appeal adverse
district court decisions of this kind, but ``it was decided, in
light of foreign policy considerations, including the U.S. role as
host to the U.N. organization, not to appeal in this instance.''
   The department said, however, it would continue to oppose any
effort to reopen the PLO's Washington office.
   The State Department had opposed Justice Department efforts to
launch an appeal, according to U.S officials who spoke on condition
they not be identified.
   The Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987 required closure of the PLO's
U.N. and Washington offices on ground that the organization
sponsors terrorism.
   The administration had opposed enactment of the anti-terrorism
measure, saying it could possibly violate international
obligations. But once the act became law, the administration moved
to enforce it.
   The Washington office, which has no U.N. affiliation, was shut
down, but Palmieri said the New York office must remain open
because of the U.S. obligations under the U.N. Headquarters
Agreement.
   The PLO's representative in Washington, Hassan Abdul Rahman,
praised the administration's decision, saying it ``is the only
sensible thing to do because otherwise they would have pursued the
misguided policy of confrontation with the U.N. and of acquiescence
with the pro-Israel lobby in Congress.''
   Abdul Rahman, whose Palestine Information Office was shut down
by the State Department last year, now heads the Palestine Affairs
Center which operates out of the Arab League offices.
   Republican Sens. Jesse Helms of North Carolina and William Roth
of Delaware had urged the administration to proceed with an appeal.
   ``At issue is the question of who determines the sovereign
powers of the United States _ the Congress and the president
through the constitutional process, or the United Nations and a
single District Court judge in New York,'' Helms wrote in a letter
to White House chief of staff Kenneth Duberstein.
   Roth and Helms both said the FBI's ability to control access to
the United States would be hampered by allowing the PLO office to
remain open. Roth added there was ``clear and irrefutable
evidence'' that the PLO sponsored terrorism.
   Roth, in a letter to Attorney General Richard Thornburgh last
week, said he intended ``to proceed further in this matter'' once
Congress returns after the August recess.

   Burma's besieged government and
military may be deliberately pushing the country toward anarchy in
an attempt to reassert control after 26 years of authoritarian
rule, diplomats and other analysts say.
   Remaining silent since Aug. 19, the government has withdrawn
troops and police from the streets while looting and other crimes
reportedly go unchecked. Civilian administration has ceased to
function in many areas.
   There have been increasing reports and some witness accounts of
military agents seeking to provoke tensions. The state media has
reported nine almost simultaneous prison uprisings in widely
different areas of the country and the escape or release of nearly
9,000 inmates.
   ``My impression is it is strongly possible that this chaos is
being planned by state authorities to give them good reasons to
intervene eventually,'' said a Japanese diplomat in Rangoon, the
Burmese capital.
   However, others, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
caution that with virtually no access to the current leadership
analysts can at best make educated guesses on its intentions.
   One Western diplomat watching developments from Bangkok said the
drift towards chaos may simply reflect confusion within the
leadership coupled with an ``arrogance, an unwillingess to accept
that they have to give up.''
   ``There's an obvious vacuum with students and others trying to
find some leadership. The obvious people to step into the vacuum
are the military, conspiratorially or not,'' an Asian diplomat in
Bangkok said.
   The leadership withdrew into itself following the announcement
Aug. 19 _ after months of bloody anti-government rioting in which
hundreds were killed _ that civilian lawyer Maung Maung had
replaced the widely hated Sein Lwin as president and head of the
sole political party.
   Maung Maung's promise of a referendum on Sept. 12 that would
pave the way for democracy did not quiet the protests that have
erupted throughout Burma in the past month.
   Unsatisfied opposition leaders demanded an interim government
and the end of one-party rule. A number of Burmese and some
outsider observers believed that Ne Win, who formally retired in
late July after wielding almost absolute power for 26 years, was
still pulling strings behind the scenes along with loyal military
officers.
   Leaders have urged that demonstrations remain peaceful so the
government cannot take advantage of the turmoil.
   ``The public must be united and well disciplined ... people must
be alert to prevent machinations of destructive elements to create
anarchy in the country,'' a former defense minister, Tin Oo, told
an anti-government rally last week.
   In Rangoon and other areas, ``democracy centers'' and block
committees have replaced judicial and civil authorities to maintain
law and order.
   Whether such makeshift measures will stop the growing
lawlessness, widespread strikes, soaring commodity prices and food
shortages remains a crucial question.
   One Swedish journalist and Burma expert, Bertil Lintner, notes
that Ne Win and his military followers used the pretext of domestic
turmoil and threats to national security to seize power from a
democratic government in 1962.
   ``The government can't control the situation so they are letting
things get worse. They hope the people will beg them to come back.
It's vicious,'' Lintner said, quoting a Burmese proverb that
translates: ``If you can't eat the beef yourself, throw sand on
it.''
   One Bangkok-based diplomat said the students and other
anti-government forces might react dramatically to keep up their
hitherto remarkable momentum.
   ``The students have been the engine of change and used a lot of
imagination. But now they have to take a new initiative,'' he said.
   ``There appears to be a paralysis in the government. A hiatus
has set in and nobody knows what to do next,'' the diplomat said.
   Referring to Ne Win, he added: ``In every dictator there is an
element of contempt for the people. He can't accept that the people
no longer want him.''

<HEAD>Ban On New Industry In L.A. Smog Basin Largely Symbolic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RIC LEYVA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federally ordered building ban on major new
Southern California polluters is largely symbolic because the
region has no plans for heavy industries, fuel refineries or power
generating plants, officials say.
   The Environmental Protection Agency on Monday announced plans to
ban construction of industry emitting more than 100 tons of carbon
monoxide or ozone pollutants a year as a congressional moratorium
on such sanctions expires.
   The ban could be extended to more than a dozen other U.S.
locations, including Denver and suburban Chicago.
   The Los Angeles Basin comes under the sanctions slated to take
effect at midnight because the air pollution control plan submitted
to the agency was rejected.
   The order came as no surprise to James M. Lents, executive
officer of the South Coast Air Quality Management District, who
said it would do nothing to reduce smog in the nation's largest and
most populous urban area.
   A lawsuit by environmentalists resulted in a January federal
court order requiring the EPA to reject the Los Angeles plan
because it failed to bring regional air quality into compliance
with a 10-year deadline set by the 1977 Clean Air Act, Lents said.
   ``We've known for some time that if Congress didn't act, the
construction ban would go into effect,'' said Lents, who oversees
smog eradication efforts in Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and
Riverside counties.
   But he said the EPA ban only affects heavy sources of pollution
such as oil refineries, power plants or automotive factories. No
such plants are planned for the region, Lents said.
   ``Based on the permit applications we've received this year and
last, the ban will have absolutely no effect on smog abatement in
the short run,'' Lents said, adding that it will take at least 20
years to clear Southern California smog to acceptable levels.
   ``There will be some psychological impact, certainly,'' Lents
said.
   He said he hoped the EPA move would spur Congress to revise the
Clean Air Act and allow cities more time to clear smog.
   ``A complete solution calls for federal action,'' he said.
``Congress needs something to motivate them, but I'm afraid this
won't be enough.''
   Mayor Tom Bradley hailed the ban as a signal that the federal
government cares about reducing air pollution, even though the
effects may be insignificant.
   ``While it will not have a major impact on the Southern
California economy,'' Bradley said, ``the construction ban on major
stationary pollution sources re-emphasizes the difficult air
quality challenge facing cities and counties of this area.''
   The EPA's announcement followed a weekend ``Air Pollution
Summit'' at City Hall organized by the Coalition for Clean Air and
Campaign California, which were brought together by Assemblyman Tom
Hayden.
   Among other proposals, speakers called for tight controls on
urban growth.
   ``Los Angeles has intolerable levels of air pollution,'' Hayden
said. ``I'm told current smog levels will expose everybody in the
basin to toxic pollution 200 to 300 percent above acceptable health
standards.''
   Los Angeles was one of about 100 metropolitan areas that the EPA
said missed December's deadline to contain smog at acceptable
levels. Because of its weather and terrain, Los Angeles has by far
the nation's highest ozone concentrations.
   Lents said his agency will present a draft of a new 20-year smog
reduction plan that would go to the EPA for approval.
   Before the end of the year, the EPA expects to adopt a policy
requiring areas not meeting pollution standards to demonstrate
steady progress, with a goal of an average 3 percent reduction in
pollution concentrations annually.
   When it adopts that policy, the agency will decide whether to
impose construction bans at Denver, Reno, Nev.; Bakersfield,
Sacramento and Fresno, Calif.; East St. Louis, Ill., the Indiana
suburbs of Louisville, Ky.; Cleveland, Atlanta and Dallas.
   Decisions on similar construction bans are pending for Ventura
County, and for the Indiana and Illinois suburbs of Chicago.

<TEXT>
   Thirty years of
firefighting haven't steeled fire boss Dave ``Ponce'' Poncin
against the worst fear a commander harbors while calling the shots
against a fire.
   ``I think the biggest fear is killing someone, injuring
people,'' Poncin said during a break from his command of the
85,000-acre North Fork fire that is eating through Yellowstone
National Park's forests.
   He especially dreads aircraft accidents.
   ``When a helicopter goes down, there are usually fatalities.
When there aren't, you count your blessings.''
   But in eight years as a fire boss, the soft-spoken man who seems
to have a minute for everyone has never realized his greatest fear.
He knows, too, that he's been lucky.
   Poncin called a helicopter crash earlier this month in the
Bighorn National Forest, in which one firefighter died and three
were injured, a ``harbinger, or an alert,'' for his squad of
tactical firefighters.
   ``It's not unexpected,'' he added.
   ``It just seems like there's more potential for accidents,''
Poncin said, especially considering the long weeks of firefighting;
the beating the helicopters take; and the stress that the crews and
the machines endure.
   Relaxing in a lawn chair at his Madison Junction fire base, the
51-year-old Poncin looked back on his 30 years with the U.S. Forest
Service and didn't mention a single regret. He also said he's
learned how to live with, but not forget, his fears.
   ``It accumulates with you, and when you think back over the
years, you think of the bad things,'' he said.
   As a boy growing up in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, he looked up to his
uncle in Montana and longed for the day when he could head west and
join the Forest Service. Poncin got his chance out of high school,
when he worked as a smoke jumper, parachuting into strategic hot
spots, in northern Idaho to pay his way through college.
   Now based in Idaho's Nez Perce National Forest, where he is an
assistant to the forest supervisor, Poncin spends summers as the
leader of 10 people who make up one of the nation's few forest fire
overhead teams, who coordinate the firefighting of major forest
fires.
   From the beginning of May until the end of October he and his
team live on two-hour standby, always knowing that wherever they
are, they can immediately be summoned to a fire.
   But Poncin wouldn't want it any other way.
   ``Firefighting is a lot like circuses,'' he said. ``It gets in
your blood. Part of it is the people (you work with). Part of it is
the challenge of chasing and catching a big fire.''
   In Yellowstone during this unusually dry summer, Poncin has
mostly been chasing.
   He spent 14 days as commanding the forces for the ``Snake
Complex,'' a collection of three tricky fires that by Monday had
charred 92,000 acres in Yellowstone.
   Less than a week later, he was sent back to Yellowstone, this
time to oversee the North Fork fire, which twice threatened the Old
Faithful geyser complex, burned across the Madison River and
through Norris.
   Married 28 years, Poncin's wife and two sons have grown
accustomed to his being away from home summers. And his wife is
quick to tell young women to steer their affections clear of
firefighters, he said.
   ``I think she's gotten used to it,'' Poncin added, chuckling.
``It's hard on a wife and family. But it's a commitment they make.''
   He realizes, too, that his family may not have to make that
commitment for much longer.
   ``I hear the engines of a retirement plane warming up on the
runway,'' Poncin said.

   NASA engineers say they can begin
final testing of space shuttle Discovery's payload now that a $100
million spacecraft-tracking satellite has been loaded into the
cargo bay.
   The tests are scheduled for the first two weeks of September and
are intended to ensure the payload, nearly identical to one
destroyed in the 1986 Challenger explosion, was installed properly,
said George Diller, a spokesman for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration.
   One test will involve the launch control center in Florida and
one will involve a ground-based tracking station at White Sands,
N.M.
   The Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, designed to help ground
controllers monitor shuttles and their payloads, is the principal
cargo for the 26th space shuttle mission, scheduled for launch in
late September or early October.
   Loading the satellite took 10 hours Monday and was completed
with no significant problems, Diller said. Deployment of the
satellite is set for the first day of the four-day Discovery
mission.
   Payload engineers and technicians, wary of the potential of
lightning from a tropical weather system that moved up the coast,
had been working feverishly during the weekend to prepare for the
satellite-loading.
   NASA officials in Washington, meanwhile, decided not to announce
a date for the resumption of space shuttle flights until after a
review Sept. 13-14, said spokesman Jim Kast.
   NASA had scheduled _ and postponed _ the launch five dates
previously, beginning with July 15, 1987. The U.S. manned space
program has been grounded since the January 1986 Challenger
explosion that killed seven astronauts.

<HEAD>Canine Virus Believed To Be Seal Killer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PIETERBUREN, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A virus common in dogs has
killed more than 11,000 seals in Western Europe's coastal waters
this summer and humans can do little to stop the spread of the
disease, a Dutch biologist says.
   Up to 80 percent of the seals in the North Sea and Kattegat
waters between Denmark and Sweden might die, Ab Osterhaus told a
news conference Monday.
   ``Canine distemper virus, or a closely related virus, is the
primary cause of the seal deaths,'' said Osterhaus in this northern
Dutch village, which has Western Europe's largest seal nursery.
   The virus causes infections of the respiratory and central
nervous systems and the digestive tracts. Osterhaus said no
specific cure exists for seals with the virus.
   Distemper may have spread to seals when one was bitten by a dog,
said Osterhaus, who works for the Dutch National Institute for
Public Health and Environmental Protection.
   Specialists in Western Europe who have been investigating the
seal deaths have speculated that pollution has played a role in the
killer epidemic.
   Osterhaus said research is still being conducted to determine if
the massive pollution of Western European waters could have
accelerated the epidemic by weakening seals' immune systems.
   ``We know that certain substances we find in the seas today ...
can affect the immune system,'' he said. ``Pollution may have
triggered the thing but it was not the cause as such.''
   Osterhaus said antibodies to canine distemper virus were found
in all of the dead seals he examined: ``The development of these
antibodies coincided clearly with the surfacing of symptoms'' of
the disease.
   A similar report was made at a news conference Monday in
Stockholm, Sweden, by patholigist Anders Bergman of Stockholm
University's veterinary school. He said he began suspecting in June
that the canine distemper virus was linked to the seal deaths.
   Bengt Klingeborn, a virologist at the veterinary school, said he
believed the 25 percent of Western European seals that have
survived so far will live through the epidemic because they have
developed antibodies.
   Osterhaus noted that there had been an outbreak of the canine
distemper virus among dogs in Greenland shortly before the epidemic
broke out among seals early this year. Each summer, thousands of
seals migrate from Greenland to Western European waters.
   Osterhaus said his team had developed an experimental vaccine
against the canine distemper virus but added ``it will not be
possible to carry out preventive vaccinations in the wild.''
   Sweden has reported 3,400 dead seals, Denmark nearly 3,000, West
Germany 3,900, Norway 600 and the Netherlands 175.

<HEAD>4,000-Year-Old Funeral Boat Gently Moved into Elaborate Museum
Tomb Scene</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 4,000 years after it was built, the
funeral boat of one of Egypt's most powerful pharaohs takes another
journey this week.
   The delicate, 32-foot long, wooden craft was gently lifted off
the floor of the Field Museum of Natural History on Monday and
rotated 180 degrees. Expert riggers who performed the tricky
maneuver kept their hands off, fearing sweat or body oils would
harm the ancient wood.
   Today, the boat used in the funeral of King Sen-wosret III in
about 1850 B.C. will be moved inch by inch a few yards to its new
setting in the museum _ a $2.2 million permanent exhibit.
   When the exhibit opens in November, it will allow visitors to
walk through the eerie world of tombs, mummies, shrines to cat
goddesses and other treasures from ancient Egypt. The museum said
the exhibit would give visitors the only opportunity outside Egypt
to enter and explore a life-size tomb complex.
   King Sen-wosret's boat _ a graceful, crescent-shaped canoe-like
craft _ is but one of more than a thousand artifacts and treasures
from the museum's collection used to recreate the burial scenes.
   Visitors enter the tomb chambers of the 5th Dynasty pharaoh,
King Unis, dating to 2400 B.C. and excavated from Saqqara, Egypt,
in 1908.
   Beneath a false door, a 35-foot burial shaft takes visitors into
the dark and eerie burial chamber. The sarcophagus is empty. When
it was excavated, the pharaoh's mummy was gone, stolen by robbers
or destroyed by time.
   Leaving the burial chamber, the visitor passes through a roughly
hewn tomb robbers' tunnel and into another scene depicting a
variety of Egyptian burial rites.
   ``This could well be the most fascinating part of the exhibit,''
said its developer, Janet Kamien. ``It gives them (visitors) a
chance to explore the age-old mysteries of mummies and life after
death.''
   Next month, the museum staff will move 23 mummies into the
exhibit, along with the accouterments their souls were to take with
them to the afterworld.
   Sen-wosret's boat will be displayed nearby.
   No one actually knows if the boat was used to transport the
king's body across the Nile River to the burial site, said Frank
Yurco, a scholar on ancient Egypt at the Oriental Institute and a
consultant on the museum project.
   The boat was one of six found at the burial compound in 1893-94
by Jacques DeMorgan, a Welsh Egyptologist. Two badly deteriorated
ones were left at the site.
   Two of the four DeMorgan saved are at the Egyptian Museum in
Cairo and the other is at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in
Pittsburgh.
   Sen-wosret is remembered for military campaigns that extended
Egypt's boundary into the Nubian region of Ethiopia and the Sudan,
as well as securing control of the Nile River to the south, he said.
   He also centralized the Egyptian government, setting the pattern
for several hundred years.
   Sen-wosret is believed to have died when he was about 50, said
Yurco.

<TEXT>
   Gangs of high school students are roving the
industrial city of Canton, committing an increasing number of
violent crimes, an official newspaper reported today.
   The Legal Daily (Fazhi Ribao) said students have murdered,
raped, robbed and are ``imitating feudal and underworld practices
by forming illegal gangs.''
   In another story, the paper called on the police to protect
railway passengers from bands of teen-agers who raid trains and
steal food and luggage.
   ``Let's deal with these little railroad guerrilla bands,'' the
paper said.
   Although the report on Canton did not say how many crimes had
been committed by the young hoodlums, it did say that 769 students
were convicted of violent crimes last year, a 78.4 percent increase
over 1986.
   The paper said the students took to a life of crime mainly
because they didn't have sufficient political education.
   ``Some teachers these days are more willing to give three
classes in math and literature than one class in political
studies,'' the paper quoted one school principal as saying.
   The paper also said pornographic and violence-oriented
literature and videocassettes were to blame for encouraging
students to break the law.
   In addition, it said an increasing number of students are
leaving school early to work. The paper said the dropouts exert a
bad influence on their friends still in school.
   China is in the midst of economic reforms that are transforming
the social stucture of the nation. Violent crime, especially
robbery, and corruption have risen dramatically in the past few
years. Canton, because it is in the forefront of the reforms, is
changing most rapidly.
   In the report on the ``railroad guerrillas,'' the paper related
an incident that occurred on June 19 as a train entered a station
in Hunan province.
   ``Several dozen youngster ran to the train and began walking by
the windows, occasionally looking in,'' the report said.
   ``Just as the train began moving, these children shoved their
hands in the windows and grabbed food, beer bottles, cans, luggage
and then fled with the goods.''
   Said the report: ``All the victims could do was curse.''

   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 299.81-point

The market's main barometer erased marginal early losses and added
132.55 points or 0.48 percent.
   The dollar, which opened at 134.57 yen, closed at 134.39, up
0.19 yen from Monday's close of 134.20 yen. It ranged between
134.30 and 134.60 yen.
   Stock market participants were continuing to stay on the
sidelines amid lackluster trading, according to an analyst with a
major securities firm in Tokyo.
   ``Because investors were still in a wait-and-see mood, trading
was thin,'' he said on condition of anonymity. ``Any notable change
is unlikely before the scheduled U.S. report on employment figures
Friday.''
   He said investors were also acting cautiously ahead of the Tokyo
Stock Exchange's plans to begin a new system of forward
transactions. Press reports have said the new system will begin
Sept. 3 and offer investors opportunities to earn profit with less
risk.

<TEXT>
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo says he believes
Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis will soon regain
the political spotlight from rival George Bush by refining his
message of the need for change.
   Cuomo told a State Capitol news conference Monday attention in
the campaign has remained centered on the Republican ticket
primarily because of the controversy surrounding the nomination of
Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle as Bush's vice presidential running mate.
   ``To me the problem is very simple ...,'' said Cuomo. ``You go
to the Republican convention. They get the focus... We're still in
the Republican Convention ... because of this ironic twist that
Quayle kept the Republicans in the mainstream with the light on
them.''
   Bush has used the spotlight to go on the offensive against
Dukakis, Cuomo said, but he predicted interest would swing back
towards Dukakis as he focuses on Americans' desire for change.

   Two Senators who investigated the Iran-Contra

an important unanswered question in the presidential campaign.
   Maine Sens. William Cohen and George Mitchell conclude that the

deal with Iran was being arranged and that he endorsed the arms
sale.
   Cohen, a Republican, and Mitchell, a Democrat, were members of
the congressional Iran-Contra investigating panel and the first

   President Reagan appointed two men to the
National Labor Relations Board, including one opposed by
right-to-work advocates.
   The appointments, because they were made while Congress is not
in session, do not require congressional approval but will be
effective only until January 1990, when the next session of
Congress ends.
   Reagan on Monday reappointed Wilford W. Johansen, a board member
since 1985 and formerly head of the NLRB's regional office in Los
Angeles, and John E. Higgins Jr., 48, NLRB deputy general counsel.
   Reagan had nominated Higgins last February, but opposition from
Sen. Jesse Helms had stalled the nomination.
   Right-to-work leaders opposed Higgins because of his office's
approval in 1986 of a contract between General Motors and the
United Auto Workers to use UAW members as the chief source of
workers for GM's new Saturn auto plant in Tennessee.

billion in payments to the government over 5{ years to settle
accusations of overcharging for price-controlled crude oil.
   The settlement, formally announced Monday but first detailed in

<HEAD>Ohio Charges Companies With Violations Over Drought Insurance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chubb Group and other insurance
companies have been charged with violating Ohio law by overselling
drought insurance policies to farmers, officials say.
   The charges, filed by Ohio Insurance Director George Fabe,
followed hearings on Chubb's marketing practices at which farmers,
insurance agents and officials of Chubb and other companies
testified.
   Chubb also faces a class-action lawsuit by farmers in 10 states
accusing it of reneging on its obligations to pay drought insurance
claims.
   In addition, Minnesota, Indiana and Iowa have scheduled hearings
regarding the drought insurance in their states.
   ``The testimony gathered in the investigation shows that the
companies involved failed to properly control the marketing of the
insurance. As a result, there were numerous violations of Ohio's
insurance laws,'' Neil Rector, deputy director of the department,
said Monday.
   Fabe issued a 12-count order against Chubb subsidiary Federal
Insurance Co., underwriter of the drought insurance.
   Other orders involving fewer counts were filed against Chubb's
administrator, Good Weather International of Jericho, N.Y.; a Good
Weather subsidiary, Good Weather Agriculture of Fresno, Calif.;
Pio-Gard Ltd., an insurance agency based in Des Moines, Iowa; and
Pio-Gard of Ohio, Pio-Gard's Ohio operation.
   The order against Chubb charges it with violating Ohio's
Deceptive Practices Act. It also charges the company with using
unlicensed agents and failing to file proper insurance policy forms.
   A spokesman at Chubb's Warren, N.J., headquarters said the
company had not seen Fabe's orders and would not comment on them
until it has time to review them.
   Penalties the department may impose range from reprimands to
suspending or revoking their licenses to operate in Ohio and fines
of up to $25,000.
   The companies have 30 days to request a hearing on the charges.
   While he said he did not believe the companies' actions were
premeditated, Fabe said the insurance ``was not carefully designed
and controlled,'' and was administered sloppily.
   During June, about 600 Ohio farmers applied for the coverage,
but Chubb announced in July that agents had oversold the policies
and began returning premium payments.
   Fabe said that even after the insurance was oversold, agents
were at farmers' homes into the early morning hours selling
policies.
   Rains that have fallen in Ohio since the hearings precluded many
farmers from collecting on the policies, but Rector said that does
not affect the department's investigation.
   ``Just because there's been no harm doesn't mean there's no
foul,'' he said.
   Two weeks ago, a federal judge in Cincinnati granted
class-action status to lawsuits by farmers in 10 states against
Chubb. The action allows other farmers to join the lawsuit. The
farmers involved live in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee,
Michigan, Illinois, Missouri, Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin.
   The farmers say Chubb sold them drought insurance but failed to
pay their claims for damage from this year's drought. Chubb has
offered to repay farmers twice the amount they paid in premiums,
but some state insurance regulators have termed the offer
inadequate.
   Chubb has maintained its innocence. The company said it
initially intended to underwrite $30 million in drought insurance
nationwide, but that a last-minute flurry of applications this
spring resulted in potential liabilities of more than $400 million.
   In recent weeks, the company took out full-page advertisements
in newspapers around the country saying it has a longstanding
reputation for business integrity.

<HEAD>Intelligence Generals Arrested In Knifing Of Journalist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military authorities said today that
two army intelligence generals were arrested for alleged roles in a
knife attack on a journalist critical of what he called military
dominance in South Korea.
   Two brigadier generals _ Lee Kyu-hong and Kwon Ki-dae _ from the
Army Intelligence Command were imprisoned and charged with
instigating the Aug. 7 attack on Oh Hong-kun, city editor of the
Joong-Ang Economic News, according to military officials.
   A major and three non-commissioned officers of the intelligence
command also were arrested for allegedly slashing Oh's thigh with
knives.
   The four soldiers admitted to attacking Oh in retaliation for
articles he wrote criticizing the military as blocking democratic
development, according to military officials, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   They said several other intelligence officers have been
questioned to determine whether they were involved. Those
questioned included Maj. Gen. Lee Jin-baek, who headed the
intelligence command, according to the officials.
   The military at first denied soldiers were involved in the
attack, but pressure from the opposition forced the government to
order an investigation.
   The opposition has demanded that all military personnel linked
to the case be punished, saying it indicates a hard-line trend
against dissent among government officials and the army.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega has extended a
five-month cease-fire with Nicaraguan rebels until the end of
September and called for new talks on a Central American peace plan.
   Ortega's extension on Monday was the fourth of a formal 60-day
truce that took effect April 1. The U.S.-backed rebels, known as
Contras, said in June they would observe the cease-fire
indefinitely.
   In a speech to a group of Indian leaders in Managua, Ortega said
the extension was issued ``so the rebels can put down their arms
and accept amnesty.''
   The rebels and the leftist Sandinista government first agreed to
a cease-fire on March 21. Two days later they signed a pact
agreeing to negotiate an end to the the 7-year-old war.
   Both sides have accused the other of violating the truce.
   A series of political talks to negotiate a permanent cease-fire
and pave the way for a peace settlement broke off June 9.
   Ortega also called on the presidents of El Salvador, Costa Rica,
Guatemala and Honduras to resume talks on a Central American peace
plan. Ortega and the four other presidents last met in January.
   Under the regional peace plan signed by the five Central
American presidents in August 1987, the Contras would lay down
their arms in exchange for concrete democratic measures by the
Sandinistas.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises Slightly, Stocks Rise In Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar inched higher against the Japanese yen
in Tokyo today, while stock regained some of their lost ground.
   After opening at 134.57 yen, the dollar edged down in moderate
trading but closed at 134.39 yen, up 0.19 yen from Monday's finish.
The U.S. currency stayed within a narrow range between 134.30 yen
and 134.60 yen, with spot volume estimated at $4.8 billion.
   Traders said the dollar held strong as Japanese life insurance
companies, investment trusts and securities firms bought the U.S.
currency.
   However, after it hit 134.60 yen, the currency started inching
down when institutional investors and exporters sold dollars in
profit-taking, they said.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues reversed a morning decline and recouped 132.55
points, or 0.48 percent, closing at 27,511.65. During the morning
session, the index lost 57.63 points.
   Although trading on the market's first section was estimated at
a sparse 450 million shares due to a wait-and-see mood still
remaining in the market, prices recovered gradually toward the end
of the day, said Yoshio Shimoyama of Nikko Securities Co.
   ``Some investors finally tried to test the water and began
buying in the afternoon session. I guess they'd been a little too
cautious,'' he said.
   Among the issues that attracted investors were steels and oil
issues.

<HEAD>Abbie Hoffman Makes NYC Comedy Debut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL STIEG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Have you heard the one about the wisecracking
political prankster who switched to stand-up comedy? No one could
tell the difference.
   Erstwhile Yippie Abbie Hoffman, fresh from a reunion of
demonstrators from the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago, made
his New York comedy debut Monday night at an Upper West Side club.
   Hoffman, whose humor and courtroom antics got national attention
during the Chicago 7 trial, spent more than an hour needling
``Actor in Chief'' Ronald Reagan and the Republicans, and
reminiscing.
   Predictably, vice-presidential candidate Dan Quayle came in for
a few jabs: ``looks like a hawk, runs like a chicken.''
   Hoffman, 51, wore a blue sweater with white stars and red
stripes _ reminding the audience of his arrest for wearing similar
garb in the '60s _ then stripped to a ``Just Say No'' T-shirt.
   In addition to politics and protest, Hoffman's topics of choice
were drugs, sex and religion. Straightforward jokes were rare, and
rambling stories and observations the norm.
   As one of the 150 or so who paid $13.50 for the show at Stand Up
NY said, ``Jay Leno doesn't have to worry.'' Hoffman had performed
his comedy act in California and Ohio before coming to New York.
   During a question-and-answer session, he was asked why he took
up comedy. He replied that his talks on college campuses always got
laughs and ``it wasn't hard to pull out all the elements of humor
from the talk.''
   Hoffman, who lives in Pennsylvania, spoke of his three children
_ ``not a yuppie in the litter'' _ and proudly recounted how his
16-year-old son was thrown out of class for telling his teacher
that if America ``is a melting pot, then the Indians must have been
boiled alive.''

<HEAD>Study: Drug Use By Pregnant Women Causing New Generation Of
Addicts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An alarming number of babies were exposed to
drugs in the womb, according to researchers who found the problem
not confined to inner-cities and warned that a ``generation of
innocent addicts'' was being created.
   The study by the National Association for Perinatal Addiction
Research and Education found that at least 11 percent of women in
36 hospitals had used illegal drugs during pregnancy.
   The hospitals were chosen to represent institutions of varying
sizes with patients from varied socio-economic levels, said Dr. Ira
J. Chasnoff, who directed the survey.
   The study, financed by the federal Office of Substance Abuse
Prevention and the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation, showed
the incidence of substance abuse among the hospitals surveyed
ranged from four-tenths of 1 percent to 27 percent of pregnant
patients.
   Chasnoff said Monday the differences often reflected how
carefully the hospitals looked for the problem, with those
hospitals with an established system of determining drug abuse
among pregnant women finding considerably more instances.
   Substances in the survey included cocaine, marijuana, heroin and
methadone, amphetamines and the hallucinogen phencyclidine, or PCP.
   Chasnoff said the high rate of pregnancies or births in which
drugs are present is not confined to the largest urban areas but is
similar in hospitals across the nation.
   He also said damage to the baby from the drugs could include
prenatal strokes, lasting brain damage, seizures after birth,
premature birth, retarded fetal growth, breathing lapses, absence
of part of the intestines or structural abnormalities in genital
and urinary organs.
   The illegal drug use in pregnancy ``cuts across racial and
socio-economic lines and maternal age groups, especially since
cocaine has become so popular,'' said Dr. Elaine M. Johnson,
director of the Office of Substance Abuse Prevention.
   ``It's not just a minority problem and it's not just an
inner-city problem,'' she said.
   ``We are producing a new generation of innocent addicts.''

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Higher, Gold Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar inched up against most foreign
currencies in early European trading today, but exchange dealers
predicted gains would be limited by fears of central bank
intervention and a lack of market-affecting news.
   Gold prices fell.
   ``After last week's activity, this is going to be a week of
consolidation,'' said Derek Walker, treasury economist at Midland
Bank in London.
   The dollar fell last week following interest rate hikes in
several European countries and heavy central bank intervention.
   Traders in Rome said they were looking ahead to important
economic indicators due out later in the week to suggest what the
dollar's near-term trend might be, in particular, U.S. August
unemployment figures to be released Friday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.19 yen to a closing 134.39. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 134.45 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday:
   _1.8707 West German marks, up from 1.8693
   _1.5775 Swiss francs, up from 1.5772
   _6.3505 French francs, up from 6.3500
   _2.1124 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1120
   _1,390.45 Italian lire, up from 1,389.50
   _1.2405 Canadian dollars, up from 1.23935
   In London, one British pound cost $1.685, slightly more
expensive for buyers than $1.684 dollars quoted in Europe late
Monday. London's financial markets were closed Monday for a bank
holiday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $429.70 a troy ounce,
down from $431.40 bid late Friday, prior to the three-day holiday
weekend. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed
a recommended price of $429.40.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $428, down from $432 dollars bid
late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.68 an ounce from Friday to
close at a bid $432.56. Hong Kong's financial markets were also
closed Monday for a national holiday.
   Silver was quoted in London Monday at a bid $6.53 a troy ounce,
down from Friday's $6.64.

   The last remnants of tropical depression Chris caused heavy rain
this morning in southern Maine after leading to at least one death
along with power outages, traffic accidents and train delays in
Greater New York.
   A woman was killed Monday night when an oak tree was blown onto
her moving car in Mamaroneck, N.Y., police there said.
   The storm downed power lines on New York's Staten Island, Long
Island and six nearby counties, knocking out power to about 31,000
customers, according to utility company spokesmen. Most of the
customers had their power restored by Monday night.
   New York-area transit officials said tree limbs fell onto
tracks, slowing commuter service during the evening rush hour
Monday. Some trains were delayed up to 35 minutes.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered today from eastern
Massachusetts to southeast Virginia and the Carolinas. Rain also
was widely scattered along the Gulf Coast and in Iowa.
   The nation's high Monday was 109 degrees at Redding, Calif.
   Today's weather forecast calls for scattered showers from New
England to Virginia, and scattered showers and thunderstorms from
the Carolinas across Georgia and Florida to the central Gulf Coast
region. Widely scattered showers and thunderstorms also were
expected to develop from Texas across New Mexico to the mountains
and deserts of Southern California.
   High temperatures today were forecast for the 60s over the
northern Great Lakes and northern New England; the 70s along the
Pacific coast, from the northern and Middle Atlantic states to the
Ohio Valley, southern Great Lakes and the upper Mississippi Valley,
and in higher elevations of the Southwest; the 90s in Florida and
southeast Texas; and upwards of 100 degrees in the desert southwest
and California's interior valleys. Elsewhere, highs were forecast
to be in the 80s.
   The nation's temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 42 degrees
at Custer, S.D., to 92 at Yuma, Ariz.

<HEAD>Recording Reveals Joking, No Snowfall Discussion Prior To Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ``black box'' tape recording from an ill-fated
Continental Airlines flight shows the pilots joked about a flight
attendant's dating habits but failed to discuss the falling snow
before the jet crashed, killing 28 people, a newspaper reported.
   In the nearly three minutes of pilot conversation omitted from a
National Transportation Safety Board transcript released earlier,
discussion between the pilot and co-pilot centered around whether a
woman flight attendant dated pilots, the Denver Post reported today.
   There was no discussion about de-icing the jet or of the snow
falling at Stapleton International Airport in the minutes before
the Nov. 15, 1987, crash, the newspaper said.
   The Union of Flight Attendants has filed a statement with the
transportation board, saying the tape shows the pilots discussing
``unnecessary and unprofessional topics.''
   But Continental spokesman Bruce Hicks said Monday the black-box
recording shows the pilots operated a ``highly skilled,
well-disciplined, professional cockpit.''
   Continental, he added, agreed with the transportation board that
the unreleased section of tape was not pertinent to the accident
investigation.
   The fact that the pilots didn't comment on the snow indicates
they didn't feel it was a problem, Hicks said.
   ``What it means is that they were human beings who had some
conversations,'' he said. ``But at no point did they neglect their
duties. ... Pilots aren't robots.''
   Transportation officials are investigating the possibility that
the DC-9's wings were not adequately de-iced prior to takeoff.
   The board also is studying the experience level of the pilots,
who both died in the crash, and turbulence from a plane landing on
the next runway as possible causes of the crash.
   The recording shows the plane taxied into position near the end
of the runway and was prepared to take off at 2:05 p.m.
   In the minutes that followed, there was confusion in the
Stapleton control tower about the identity of Flight 1713, and the
tower cleared another plane to take off first.
   In the conversation between pilots that followed, the newspaper
said Frank Zvonek, the 43-year-old captain, mentioned a flight
attendant.
   ``She said she doesn't date pilots,'' Zvonek was quoted as
saying. ``She doesn't go for one-night stands.''
   Co-pilot Lee Edward Bruecher, 26, reportedly asked, ``How come
she doesn't date pilots? Is it the same reason why I don't date
flight attendants? ... (laughter)
   ``She seems real nice.''
   Minutes later, Flight 1713 was cleared for takeoff and began
rolling down the runway. At 2:15 p.m., the plane climbed into the
air.
   Ten seconds later, Bruecher shouted an obscenity. The DC-9
flipped and crashed.

<HEAD>Bakkers Say They Were Ignorant Of PTL's Finances</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jim and Tammy Bakker told attorneys they
didn't know where PTL's money came from or how its finances were
managed when they led the television ministry, documents filed with
U.S. Bankruptcy Court show.
   In depositions filed Monday with the Columbia court, the Bakkers
said top aides handled most of PTL's money matters.
   Asked about six-figure bonuses given her, Mrs. Bakker said, ``I
just know they (board members) put them in my account, and I spent
them like a typical woman.''
   Bakker, who repeatedly said he did not recall seeing various
memos about PTL's finances, was asked if he thought aides did not
properly inform him.
   He replied, ``I was exhausted half the time and reading memos at
11 or 12 (o'clock) before dropping off to sleep, and I could have
been informed and would not even know it, I would have been so
tired.''
   The IRS claims Mrs. Bakker's annual salaries during her last
four years at PTL were $84,964 in 1983-84, $142,586 in 1984-85, and
$90,736 in both 1985-86 and 1986-87. During that period she also
received bonuses totaling $825,000, IRS records show.
   PTL records show that during those years Bakker, as PTL's
leader, received nearly $8.3 million in salary, bonuses and other
perks.
   The Bakkers' comments were contained in 814 pages of depositions
taken under oath for a Sept. 12 trial in which PTL attorneys will
try to recover $52 million in ministry assets from the Bakkers and
former top aide David Taggart. PTL claims they grossly mismanaged
the ministry and took millions of dollars from PTL for their
personal use.
   The Bakkers are suing PTL for $1.8 million for equity in the
parsonage they once occupied. Taggart is suing for $185,000, a
year's salary.
   Mrs. Bakker said she was unaware that she and her husband are
suing PTL for $1.8 million.
   Mrs. Bakker, who was cohost of PTL's ``Jim and Tammy Show'' and
had her own program called ``Tammy's House Party,'' said in the
deposition that she didn't know how many bonuses PTL's board gave
her and didn't recall the amounts of the bonuses.
   ``I would go to them and tell them they didn't need to do
that,'' she said, ``and they would always tell me, `Well, you're
worth more than that to us and we wish it could be more.'''
   Mrs. Bakker said she and her husband were always careful to use
their money _ not PTL's _ to pay personal bills.She also said she
and her husband ``have always been very, very open with the
Internal Revenue.''
   A federal grand jury in Charlotte, N.C., is investigating
whether Bakker and his top aides committed tax, wire or mail fraud.
That probe focuses on how PTL, under Bakker, raised and spent
millions of dollars in contributions.
   Bakker resigned as PTL president in March 1987 after
acknowledging a sexual encounter with former church secretary
Jessica Hahn in 1980.
   Mrs. Bakker would not say when she learned of her husband's
encounter with Hahn. ``I don't think it has anything to do with the
case,'' she said.
   Asked about a $10,000 expenditure of PTL funds for security at a
Gatlinburg, Tenn., residence he once occupied, Bakker said he and
his family had received threats.
   ``A man came several years ago to murder my daughter and rape
her, and he is in a mental institution,'' Bakker said.

<HEAD>Fugitive Financial Planner Charged With Embezzlement, Mail Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fugitive financial planner who sent notes of
apology to his clients after he allegedly stole $25 million of
their funds has been charged with embezzlement and mail fraud.
   Complaints filed Monday in U.S. District Court allege that Henry
Gherman, 52, masterminded a 10-year scheme that may have swindled
nearly 50 investors, said U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen.
   Authorities do not know where Gherman is hiding, Miami FBI
spokesman Paul Miller said. He did not reveal his location in
telephone calls to his wife and her attorney.
   Gherman is accused of illegally transferring clients' money to a
Miami bank account since 1978 and issuing false statements
indicating investments in money-market funds and certificates of
deposit, said a statement by Lehtinen and FBI agent William Wells.
   The federal complaints cite five counts of embezzlement and two
counts of mail fraud, Lehtinen said, adding other charges were
possible. The case could be brought before a federal grand jury
next month, he said.
   Gherman faces 35 years in prison and fines in excess of $1.5
million if convicted on all counts, Lehtinen said.
   Gherman had a ``longstanding pattern of embezzlement'' from
about 25 professional associations handling pension funds and other
assets for members, Lehtinen said. Gherman's scheme could have
affected nearly 50 investors, ranging from prominent Miami Beach
doctors and smaller investors such as clerks and nurses.
   Gherman sent hand-written notes of apology to his clients Aug.
10 when he dropped out of sight.
   Larry Torrence, assistant special agent for the FBI, said most
of the clients' losses were not insured.
   Torrence said Gherman is the only defendant in the case, but
``that could change'' as the probe continues.
   A group of Gherman's former clients has filed a lawsuit in Dade
Circuit Court seeking return of their money.

<HEAD>China Tests Boeing Helicopter In Tibet</HEAD>

   China is interested in buying at least a dozen
Boeing helicopters that would be used in developing a rapid
deployment force, a Chinese military official said today.
   He said Chinese officers recently tested a Chinook CH-47D
helicopter on the Tibetan plateau at more than 15,000 feet high.
   A Boeing spokesman in Philadelphia, where the company's
helicopter division is based, said Boeing rented a C-5 cargo plane
from the U.S. Air Force to ship the helicopter to Tibet in early
August.
   ``The Chinese interest is very encouraging,'' said company
spokesman Robert Togerson. ``The helicopter met or surpassed their
specifications.''
   The spokesman for the prospective purchaser, Poly Technologies
Inc., which handles weapons deals for the Chinese military, said
China would decide in September whether to buy the helicopters.
   He said the military had so far only considered the Boeing model.
   A spokesman for Boeing in Beijing said the helicopters sell for
about $15 million each.
   ``If completed it would be one of the largest direct sales of
military goods between the United States and China,'' he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The largest U.S.-China military contract was signed in August
1987 with Grumman Corp., of Bethpage, N.Y., and is worth $245
million. The avionics firm contracted to upgrade the electronics
system of China's F-8 fighter jet.
   The Chinese military spokesman, who identified himself only as
Kang, said China would use the helicopters for military purposes
``inside China.''
   He said the copters were being considered as part of a program
to develop a rapid deployment force for the Chinese military.
   The Boeing spokesman in Beijing said the Chinese also could use
the helicopters to add an airborne wing to their army.
   The CH-47D is the latest version of the CH-47, the U.S. Army's
primary medium-lift helicopter. Boeing says that its main use is
for rapid deployment of tactical units in combat.
   The helicopter can carry up to 44 combat-equipped soldiers and
has a top speed of 174 mph and a cruising speed of 161 mph.
   Kang said the helicopter tests in Tibet had nothing to do with
recent unrest in the area. Tibetan activists rioted in Lhasa last
autumn and again in March. More than 30 Tibetans and Chinese police
were killed.
   A Western military analyst in Beijing said he did not think the
helicopters, if purchased, would be used to quell domestic unrest.
   ``The Chinese traditionally test helicopters for high-altitude.
Over one-third of the country is mountainous,'' he said. Before
buying 24 medium-sized Blackhawk helicopters from the American firm
Sikorsky Co. several years ago, China also tested them in Tibet, he
said.
   Western military analysts, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the prospective purchase would be consistent with Chinese
military reforms designed to create a more professional army.
   The analysts pointed to China's poor showing in its brief war
with Vietnam as an example of China's need to modernize its
military. China has shifted its military focus from preparedness
for all-out war to training for limited conflicts.
   ``These types of conflicts need a speedy response,'' said one
diplomat. ``The Boeing helicopters could be useful.''
   In June, China announced the formation of the ``First Platoon''
_ an airborne force trained in rapid response techniques.
   Today's official China Daily reported several military regions
recently completed exercises in north and south China to upgrade
their ability to respond rapidly to ``local conflict.''

<HEAD>Mother Ordered To Practice Birth Control Is Pregnant, Lawyer Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A teen-age mother of three ordered by a judge to
practice birth control for the rest of her child-bearing years
after she abandoned her sons for three days is expecting another
child, her attorney said.
   Debra Ann Forster, 18, was sentenced by Judge Linsay Ellis
Budzyn in May to lifetime probation and ordered to use birth
control after pleading guilty to two counts of attempted child
abuse.
   Ms. Forster was charged after she left her sons, William, then
18 months old, and Scott, then 6 months old, alone for three days
in a Mesa apartment in May 1987.
   Garrett Simpson, a deputy public defender representing Ms.
Forster, said Monday that Ms. Forster's pregnancy was confirmed
early last week when she went to St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical
Center for a pregnancy test. The baby is due in April, he said.
   Simpson refused to say whether Forster was practicing any form
of birth control when she became pregnant.
   He asked Ms. Budzyn whether abortion is a form of birth control
and whether Ms. Forster should obtain one to abide by the terms of
her probation.
   The judge said that she ``would never make such a ruling.''
   Ms. Budzyn also said that because no birth-control device is
``100 percent foolproof,'' she will not revoke Forster's lifetime
probation.
   ``I'm not going to send her to prison because she is pregnant,''
she said.
   Ms. Forster had a third child, a daughter, while awaiting trial
this year. The girl has since been adopted, according to court
records.
   The two boys were placed in foster homes and court records show
that Ms. Forster signed papers allowing the children to be offered
for adoption.

<HEAD>Car Bomb Explodes In Lebanese Town</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A car bomb exploded today in the
Syrian-policed market town of Chtoura. Police said six people were
wounded.
   A police spokesman said a white Volvo blew up at around 1 p.m.
near a bank on the main street of the town in eastern Lebanon. The
blast damaged parked cars, setting several on fire, and shattered
windows in nearby buildings.
   The spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing
regulations, said ambulances and fire engines went to the scene.
Syrian troops sealed off the blast area.
   The car bomb was the 12th in Lebanon this year. By police count,
103 people have been killed and 371 wounded in the bombings.
   As with the earlier bombings this year, there was no claim of
responsibility for today's explosion.
   The highway where the bomb exploded links the Bekaa Valley with
Beirut and is the main route used by the Syrian army to supply its
forces in Moslem west Beirut.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, maintains about 40,000
troops in the Bekaa Valley, north Lebanon as well as west and south
Beirut.
   The Syrians have been at odds with Lebanon's Christians since
President Amin Gemayel, a Maronite Catholic, scuttled a
Syrian-brokered December 1985 treaty between Christians and Moslems
to end Lebanon's 13-year-old civil war.
   Christian anger has mounted following Syria's support for one of
its Christian allies, former President Suleiman Franjieh, in
Lebanon's presidential contest.
   Right-wing militants of the Lebanese Forces, the Christians'
main militia, oppose Franjieh. Syrian-backed Moslem factions have
accused the militia of forcibly preventing Christian legislators
from attending an Aug. 18 parliamentary session where a president
was to have been elected.
   Only 38 of the 76 deputies turned up. Because that was not
enough for a quorum, the election was postponed. No new date has
been set.
   Gemayel's six-year term expires Sept. 23. He cannot run for a
second term.

   Move over, James Bond.
   Ferdinand Marcos is now the owner of an armor-plated,
bullet-proof automobile, the rival of any car used by Agent 007.
   The deposed Philippines leader, according to an aide, will
receive the customized 1985 Mercedes SEL today as an early birthday
present.
   Marcos spokesman Gemmo Trinidad said supporters on the mainland
believed the car would be a useful birthday present, considering
Marcos' repeated claims that he is stalked by assassins.
   The car, Trinidad said, was shipped here by air freight Monday.
   Honolulu television station KGMB reported Monday that the dark
blue, four-door Mercedes is equipped with features right out of a
spy novel _ including blinding rear lights.
   The car, the station reported, is worth around $150,000 and cost
about $17,000 to ship from the mainland to Hawaii.
   Marcos celebrates his 71st birthday next month.

<HEAD>Slumlord to Pay $30,000 to $35,000 Each to Families in Restitution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Beverly Hills neurosurgeon and convicted
slumlord who ignored needed repairs to his vermin-infested
buildings has agreed to pay 70 tenants as much as $35,000 apiece
under a record settlement, lawyers said.
   The $2.5 million settlement was announced Monday by Legal Aid
Foundation attorneys Barrett Litt and Michael Bodaken, who brought
the suit against Dr. Milton Avol, 65.
   Avol, once described by a prosecutor as ``the most recalcitrant
slumlord in Los Angeles,'' previously was sentenced to house arrest
in his own rat-infested building. He served 30 days.
   He also served 55 days of a nine-month jail sentence, a term
that began Christmas Eve.
   Tenants accused Avol of cutting off water, failing to make
needed repairs, allowing buildings to become infested with rats and
bugs, and attempting to evict the tenants who complained to
authorities.
   Payments averaging from $30,000 to $35,000 will be made to 70
families comprising 319 adults and children who lived in two of
Avol's downtown South Main Street buldings, Litt said.
   ``We hope it will give a clear signal to those who run buildings
in dilapidated conditions that it will cost them a great deal of
money to do so, and it's in their own best economic interest to
clean up the buildings,'' Litt said.
   Paul Hittelman, Avol's attorney, said the settlement did not
mean his client was admitting liability.
   Also named as defendants were Avol's wife, Ann, and Hyoung and
Sook Pak, who bought the building from Avol in 1986. The Paks will
pay about 10 percent of the settlement costs.
   The buildings are now owned by Anthony Barras Ltd., which has
agreed to make complete repairs.

<HEAD>Infiltration Attempt Foiled, Four Arabs Wounded</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN IZENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lebanese Christian villagers joined by Israeli
troops today blocked a guerrilla squad trying to infiltrate Israel
from south Lebanon and at least one guerrilla was wounded, Israel
radio said.
   It was the first time Israel has reported that Lebanese
villagers helped thwart a border crossing. The infiltration attempt
was the 17th since the Palestinian uprising broke out in
Israeli-occupied territories almost nine months ago.
   In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Palestinians went on strike to
protest the planned deportation of 25 fellow Arabs.
   Israeli troops shot and wounded four Palestinians in the West
Bank city of Nablus during a protest, hospital officials said. The
army said it was checking the report.
   Israel radio said the attempted infiltration today occurred near
the village of Khalata, about 2{ miles north of the Israeli border.
   It said a villager spotted the guerrilla squad walking out of a
ravine and moving across a field near the village. The villagers
alerted others and 10 Lebanese men armed themselves and stopped the
squad, it said.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, speaking on the radio, said the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army initially encountered the
guerrillas.
   ``The IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) soldiers joined them,'' he
said. ``To the best of my knowledge, there were no people wounded
on our side.''
   Israel ended a three-year occupation of Lebanon in the summer of
1985, but maintains about 1,000 soldiers in a self-declared
security zone to back up the mostly Christian South Lebanon Army.
   In other developments, the Supreme Court turned down two appeals
by Faisal Husseini, head of the banned Arab Studies Center, to open
his court hearings to the public and to make secret prosecution
documents available to his attorneys.
   Husseini, whose case is currently before the Jerusalem District
Court, is being held for the third time under emergency regulations
which permit detention for up to six months without trial.
   The United States has called on Israel either to release
Husseini or bring him to trial. Israel maintains Husseini is a key
Palestine Liberation Organization leader in the occupied
territories.
   At the Jneid Prison near Nablus, a military appeals board today
began a closed hearing on the appeals of 15 Palestinians slated for
deportation. Another 10 face deportation orders.
   Thirty-three Arabs have been expelled since the ``intefadah,''
or uprising, began. During that time 255 Palestinian have been
killed, most of them by army gunfire. Four Israelis also have died.
   Curfews were in effect today on the Jabaliya, Bureij and
Nusseirat refugee camps in Gaza.
   A military spokesman said the curfews were ``preventive
measures'' because previous general strikes _ a main tactic of
resistance _ had triggered violent protests in the camps.
   In Nablus, the largest city in the West Bank with over 100,000
residents, the army lifted a five-day curfew but streets remained
deserted because of the general strike. Outlawed Palestinian flags
flew from the city's largest mosque and others were draped on
electricity poles.
   Jewish settlers in the occupied territories, meanwhile,
complained angrily after police confiscated a handgun from a
settler at Kedummim, near Nablus.
   The settler, Eliezer Shochat, fired in the direction of
Palestinian youths who stoned his car Sunday in the West Bank.
Israel radio reported Shochat may have hit two Palestinians and
said police were investigating.

   A homeless man who barricaded himself in
a historic 19th-century fort and threatened to blow it up had
enough provisions to last two weeks but surrendered after about
seven hours.
   While police and FBI agents surrounded Fort Vancouver on Monday,
the man used black powder to fire several apparently harmless shots
from replicas of cannons inside the reconstructed log fort. No one
was injured.
   The man, who identified himself as Ken Rose, 40, surrendered in
exchange for an opportunity to talk to reporters.
   The former Marine said Vietnam veterans need their own program,
run by other veterans, to overcome unique emotional and
psychological problems.
   ``Veterans in this country paid their dues. They served with
pride,'' Rose, of the Tillamook, Ore., area, told reporters. ``It's
a disgrace to see them sleeping on the sidewalk. They face a lot of
emotional, psychological and physical problems that are unlike
(those facing) any other segment of the population in America.''
   Police arrested Rose and he was held in the Clark County Jail in
lieu of $10,000 bail on a state charge of first-degree burglary,
police Capt. Ray Anderson said. Federal officials declined to
prosecute him.
   Rose used a rope to scale the fort's 15-foot walls and said he
had enough provisions to hold out for two weeks. But he agreed with
an FBI negotiator who told him that would be pointless.
   FBI negotiators initially took charge because the 4{-acre fort,
originally built in the early 1800s, is a federal landmark.
   Rose said he was recently treated in the Veterans Administration
Hospital in Portland, Ore., for post-traumatic stress syndrome and
alcoholism.
   He said he had been living in his car and with friends. He said
he was a Marine corporal in Vietnam in 1967 and 1968, including the
Tet offensive.

<TEXT>
   A reputed member of the Gambino crime family who
reportedly served as a government informant for years was killed
outside his Brooklyn home.
   ``I think his days were numbered from the day'' his informer
status was made public in March 1985, said a federal source who
spoke on the condition his identity not be revealed.
   The victim, Wilfred (``Willie Boy'') Johnson, was a co-defendant
in a racketeering trial at which he and John Gotti, reputed head of
the Gambino family, were acquitted in April 1987.
   An FBI agent testified in court that Gotti's faction had put out
a murder contract on Johnson.
   Johnson, 53, was shot several times, including in the back of
the head, with a .380-caliber automatic shortly after 6 a.m.
Monday, said Detective Louis Llanes, a police spokesman. Several
spent shells were found between Johnson's home and his car, which
was parked a block away.
   ``I don't think there was any doubt that it was
Gotti-sanctioned,'' said the source. ``One bullet in the head would
have done the job, the 13 other ones were meant as a message.''
   The government said Johnson, whose criminal record dated to
1952, had been jailed for 18 months before the trial for his own
safety because he had been on the FBI payroll from 1966 to 1974 and
then resumed working as an unpaid snitch in 1980.
   A prosecutor said in court papers that Johnson had passed the
FBI details of the Gambino family hierarchy and its activities in
gambling, loansharking, hijacking and murder.
   But his lawyer, Richard Rehbock, denied that Johnson was ever an
informant and said he was denied bail in an unsuccessful government
attempt to make him cooperate and discredit him with his
co-defendants.
   Prosecutors offered Johnson a place in the federal witness
protection program before his informer status was revealed, but
Johnson refused, saying he would never testify against his
associates, according to court documents.

   Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Sam Shepard
says he learned to direct his first feature film the way he learned
everything else: just doing it.
   ``You can study things until they're over the hill _ read a lot
of books, see a lot of films,'' Shepard says in the September issue
of Vogue. ``But the only way to learn something is simply to do it.
Just step across the fence.''
   Shepard has acted in several films but ``Far North,'' due out
next month, is his first directorial effort. It stars Jessica
Lange, his live-in lover, and was shot entirely in northern
Minnesota, where she was born and grew up.
   Shepard, whose plays include the 1979 Pulitzer Prize-winning
``Buried Child,'' ``True West,'' ``Fool for Love'' and ``A Lie of
the Mind,'' says he doesn't get very excited about acting.
   ``But filmmaking I can get passionate about because it's a
natural extension of writing,'' he said. ``It's everything you wish
writing could be: you can visualize things, and there they are; you
can extend shots, change the colors, put wind in when the wind
isn't there.''

<TEXT>
   A Church of England bishop met today with
Hassan Khaled, spiritual leader of Lebanon's Sunni Moslems, as part
of an effort to free foreigners held captive by Moslem extremists.
   The Right Rev. John Brown, bishop of the Persian Gulf and
Cyprus, arrived in Christian east Beirut on Sunday seeking word on
the fate of four missing Iranians. He had been in Tehran earlier
this month.
   Iranians leaders have said they will use their influence with
Shiite Moslems holding hostages in Lebanon to free their captives
if the Church of England helps determine what happened to the
Iranians, who disappeared in Christian Lebanese territory six years
ago.
   Four Britons are missing in Lebanon, along with nine Americans,
an Indian, an Italian, a West German and two unidentified
foreigners. Most are believed held by Shiite groups.
   Brown, who is based in Cyprus, said he was very optimistic about
the progress of his discussions in Beirut.
   ``It's just a feeling, but we're optimistic,'' he told reporters
after a 45-minute meeting with Hassan. Brown declined to elaborate.
   It was Brown's second visit to Lebanon in a month as
representative of Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, primate
of the Church of England.
   The Iranians disappeared while driving in the Christian
heartland north of Beirut after the Israeli army invaded Lebanon in
June 1982. They were presumed to have been kidnapped, but there was
no claim of responsibility. There have been unconfirmed reports
they were killed.
   Brown was asked if Iran would keep its promise to help free the
foreign hostages if he received confirmation the four Iranians are
dead.
   ``I simply don't know what effect it will have on the government
because I'm not a government man. I'm a churchman,'' Brown replied.
   Brown, who speaks Arabic, also sought word on the Iranians' fate
Sunday when he met with Mar Nasrallah Butros Sfeir, spiritual head
of Lebanon's Maronite Catholics.
   Brown said he had some leads, but declined to give any details.
   In a telephone interview Monday, Brown predicted Anglican Church
envoy Terry Waite, missing since Jan. 20, 1987, will be released.
Brown stressed he did not know when, however, and declined to
elaborate.
   Waite disappeared after leaving his west Beirut hotel for a
meeting with Islamic Jihad, a pro-Iranian Shiite faction that holds
two Americans, Terry Anderson and Thomas Sutherland.

   Miss Liberty, the largest replica in the

rooftop perch and hit the road for a July 4, 1989, celebration.
   ``An additional 8 million people a year will see the statue,''
said John S.P. Samford, president of Liberty National, a subsidiary
of Torchmark Corp., an insurance and financial services company.
   The statue has stood atop the Liberty National Life Insurance
Co. headquarters in downtown Birmingham for 30 years.
   The statue will be moved to a six-acre site near Interstate 459
just south of Birmingham.
   Miss Liberty's new site will include a large viewing plaza and a
grassy slope suitable for picnics. The statue will be placed on a
granite pedestal 61 feet tall, which will sit in the center of the
plaza.
   At 31 feet tall and 20,000 pounds, Miss Liberty is one-fifth the
size of the Statue of Liberty in New York harbor. Like the original
Statue of Liberty, the replica was cast in France.

   A man known as the ``Elevator Rapist'' was
sentenced to the maximum 175 years in prison by a judge who said he
had never seen ``a more violent or predatory defendant.''
   Ronnie Matthews, 29, was sentenced in Manhattan state Supreme
Court Monday to consecutive terms on 15 counts of robbery, rape,
sodomy and sexual abuse.
   He was convicted July 11 of raping and robbing seven women
ranging in age from 18 to 25 years old from September to December
last year. An eighth victim was robbed but not raped.
   Police said Matthews confronted his victims at knifepoint in
elevators at three Harlem housing projects, then forced them into
stairwells where he assaulted them.
   He had been paroled only five months before the attacks began
after serving six years for forcible sodomy.
   Matthews showed no emotion during sentencing and maintained his
innocence, noting that one of the victims failed to identify him.
He also denied that he was the same Ronnie Matthews convicted of
the earlier offense.
   ``In my 18 years on the bench, I have never seen a more violent
or predatory defendant,'' said Justice Harold Rothwax. ``The
defendant lacks all remorse and poses a serious danger to the
community. He should be kept from the community for the rest of his
natural life.''
   Matthews will be eligible for parole in 87{ years.

   The 10-year-old daughter of a
couple presumed killed by security forces during Argentina's
``dirty war'' was ordered taken from her natural grandparents and
returned to her adoptive parents.
   Federal Judge Alfredo Sanudo, who handed down the decision,
``doesn't deserve to live,'' said Ruben Fontana, Juliana's maternal
grandfather.
   Fontana vowed to appeal the order, issued Monday in a
closed-door hearing in the Buenos Aires suburb of Moron.
   Jose and Carmen Trevino adopted the dark, chubby-cheeked Juliana
after she was found as an infant in the doorway of a building and
taken to an orphanage. They did not comment on the ruling to
reporters outside the courtroom.
   The ``Juliana Case,'' as it is called in South America, is
reminiscent of ``The Official Story,'' the Oscar-winning 1985
Argentine film about a family that adopts the child of a woman
killed by security forces.
   In the 1970s, at least 9,000 people vanished in Argentina and
were presumed abducted and killed by security agents in the ``dirty
war,'' which was ordered by the military dictatorship to quell the
leftist opposition. Several military leaders have been tried,
convicted and sentenced for their role in the terror.
   The Trevinos _ unlike other families who didn't question where
their children came from _ adopted Juliana legally, told her she
was adopted, and tried for years to track down her biological
parents.
   Jose Trevino, a journalist, recently told The Associated Press:
   ``From the first moment, we told Juliana she was adopted .... If
her real parents appeared, my wife and I told ourselves we would
rip up the documents'' and return the child.
   The Trevinos brought Juliana to the attention of her natural
grandparents earlier this year, when they gave a sample of her
blood to a clinic set up to match children with parents who had
``disappeared.''
   The blood sample proved Juliana was the daughter of Pedro Fabian
Sandoval and Liliana Fontana _ who was pregnant when the couple was
arrested on July 1, 1977 _ and the granddaughter of Ruben and
Clelia Fontana.
   On June 23, the day the Trevinos received the news from the
blood bank, they were ordered to appear in court. Former Federal
Judge Juan Ramos Padilla gave them two choices: return Juliana to
her grandparents, or give her to a foster home.
   The Trevinos chose the former, but filed an appeal arguing that
they had followed the legal requirements to adopt Juliana and were
better suited to care for her than the grandparents.
   Sanudo, who replaced Ramos Padilla after the latter retired,
overturned his predecessor's ruling.
   The military, which staged a 1976 coup, turned over power to
elected civilian President Raul Alfonsin in 1983.

<HEAD>Government Appeals For End of Rail Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SEIN WIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government appealed to Buddhist monks
and the public today to help end a five-day-old railway strike that
has paralyzed transportation nationwide.
   ``The stoppage of rail service, which is the cheapest mode of
transportation, has caused hardship to the people and also caused
the price of food to spiral,'' state-run Rangoon radio said.
   ``The government, therefore, appealed to the Buddhist monks and
the public to help solve the rail transportation problem,'' the
brief broadcast said.
   Monks are an influential element of Burmese society. They and
activist students have been in the vanguard of mass pro-democracy
demonstrations that began July 23 when 77-year-old Ne Win resigned
after 26 years of authoritarian rule and was replaced by hardliner
Sein Lwin.
   The nation's railroad workers went on strike last Friday,
shutting down the most affordable form of long-distance
transportation and making it difficult to move food into the cities.
   Union Burma Airways suspended all domestic and international
operations, and bus service was severely reduced. Private buses
have since raised their fares from 8 to 50.
   Strikes also closed oil refineries in Syriam across the Rangoon
River and in Mann in central Burma, crippled most factories of the
Industries Ministry and left foreign ships waiting at Rangoon port,
officials said.
   Gasoline became scarce and its price soared. With most gas
stations closed, the black market price rose from about $4.17 to
$16.67 per gallon.
   That sent people running to buy bicycles, which were selling
today at 15 percent above their normal price.
   Bicycles imported from Thailand and China sell for about
$600-$700 in Burma. Those produced at government-run factories sell
for about $133 but are in short supply, and today the black market
price jumped to $416.
   As part of Burma's continuing turmoil, student leaders on Sunday
announced the formation of a student union. On Monday, dock workers
said they too had formed a union and 21 elder statesmen announced
formation of a Committee for Democracy.
   After Ne Win led the 1962 military coup that ended Burma's
experiment with democracy, he outlawed all political parties,
unions and associations except for the ruling Burma Socialist
Program party. The unions and the new Committee for Democracy are
illegal under Burma's present constitution.
   Burma's leadership disintegrated following the Aug. 19
announcement that civilian lawyer Maung Maung had replaced the
hated Sein Lwin as president and head of the sole political party.
   Maung Maung's promise of a referendum Sept. 12 that would pave
the way for democracy did not quiet the demonstrations, in which
hundreds of people have died in the past month.
   Reports reaching Rangoon Monday said the governments of at least
eight cities have stopped operating and Buddhist monks, residents
and some striking policemen have organized protection of their
neighborhoods. The reports said many offices of the Socialist
Program Party were closed, while some were destroyed by protesters.
   The cities included Mandalay, Sagaing, Monywa, Minbu and Magwe
in northern Burma, Taunggyi in Shan State, Moulmein in Mon State
and Bassein in the Irrawaddy Delta. The reports gave no details.

   Michael Dukakis today countered George
Bush's criticism of him on defense issues and said the next
president can't have it all if he's serious about erasing the
federal deficit.
   The Democratic nominee also hinted he was approaching the point
at which he would respond more aggressively to Republican attacks,
saying it would be ``unfortunate'' but necessary to reshape the
election debate.
   Dukakis, meeting with western Massachusetts editors on the final
day of a two-day visit to the region, fired back quickly when asked
about Bush's assertions that Dukakis would endanger national
security because of his foreign policy inexperience.
   ``Mr. Bush says he wants them all,'' Dukakis said after listing
his opposition to building MX missiles on railroad cars, two new
supercarrier task forces and deploying the Star Wars space defense
system.
   ``You can't have them all,'' Dukakis said. ``Not if you're
serious about providing the resources our conventional forces need
and not if you're serious about getting that deficit down.''
   Dukakis, who has been trying to dispel talk that his campaign
has stagnated, has blamed such talk on the media attention given to
Bush and his running mate, Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, following the
Republican convention and to reports about unsubstantiated rumors
about Dukakis and his wife.
   ``If it continues you have to respond,'' he said. ``I think
that's unfortunate but I think it's very clear what kind of a
campaign the Republicans are running and I think we're going to
have to deal with it.''
   For Dukakis, Monday was a bizarre day in which he first canceled
a news conference after aides complained network television was
ignoring his speeches but later met with reporters armed with
questions about whether his campaign was in a state of confusion.
   ``Back by popular demand,'' he joked as he walked into a
rescheduled news conference.
   The confusion comes at a time when many Democratic strategists
inside and outside the Dukakis campaign are concerned that Dukakis
has allowed Bush to seize control of the debate with attacks on the
Democrat's patriotism, views on defense and gun control and the
furlough program.
   Dukakis told reporters he was ``trying to get this campaign up
where it belongs'' by discussing his economic positions. He came to
western Massachusetts to highlight that region's economic
resurgence.
   The governor said face-to-face debates were the best place to
respond to Bush's attacks but then offered a preview by countering
the vice president's attacks on the furlough program, which until
amended last year extended eligibility to first-degree murderers.
   Dukakis said he wanted to ask Bush about the 16,000 furloughs
granted to federal prisoners last year, ``some lasting 45 days and
many to convicted drug pushers Mr. Bush says he wants to execute.''
   In a speech before the news conference, Dukakis also attacked
Bush's support for a reduction in the capital gains tax.
   ``We're not going to accept Mr. Bush's suggestion that the way
to build opportunity for our citizens is to cut taxes for the
wealthy again, this time with a $40 billion handout, 70 percent of
which would go to those making $200,000 a year or more,'' he said.
   Dukakis also called for an end to questions about Quayle's
military and academic records in favor of issues-related media
coverage.
   ``Let's put the last few weeks behind us,'' Dukakis said. ``The
dog days of August are almost over. The curtain is going up on the
greatest exercise of political freedom the world has ever known.''
   Dukakis said time was too short to engage in personal attacks.
   ``Ten weeks from tomorrow, America will choose a new
president,'' he said. ``The campaign is a golden and historic
moment to define our nation's future. My friends, let us not waste
this opportunity.
   ``Because the issue in this campaign is not how well Mr. Bush
did one night in New Orleans or how well I did one night in Atlanta.
   ``The issue is not whose speechwriter should get an Emmy. The
issue is whose values should get into the White House.
   ``The American people aren't interested in the grades that some
of us might have gotten while we were in college; they care about
whether their children will have the chance to go to college.''

   A fuming mad Geraldo Rivera says he's ``going to
go after'' two part-time actors who say they fibbed their way onto
his and other popular TV talk shows by pretending to have undergone
sex therapy.
   Tani Freiwald, 37, and Wes Bailey, 33, both of Chicago, said
they acted the roles of people with sexual problems because they
wanted to experience the thrill of appearing on millions of
television screens from coast to coast.
   In addition to the ``Geraldo'' show, both appeared on ``Sally
Jessy Raphael Show,'' while Ms. Freiwald appeared on the ``Oprah
Winfrey Show.''
   Appearing this morning on ``CBS This Morning,'' Bailey said the
only time he was a little scared during the talk-show stints was
during a ``Sally Jessy Raphael Show,'' when the host told the
audience that he and Ms. Freiwald were not actors reproducing a
scene.
   ``There was a little clenching in the stomachs ... but we've
both been performers all our adult lives,'' Bailey said.
   ``After you go through the first one, they get really easy,''
Ms. Freiwald added.
   Rivera said he is considering legal action.
   ``These people are admitting now to having committed fraud or at
least misrepresentation ... and we're going to go after them,''
Rivera said Monday in a telephone interview from New York.
   ``This is something that goes right to the integrity of the
broadcast itself. I'm really spitting mad.''
   However, a psychologist who recommended the pair as guests
maintained they weren't acting.
   Bailey said he played a 35-year-old virgin on a Rivera show in
July and an impotent husband on a ``Sally Jessy Raphael Show''
televised in May.
   In both cases, he said he claimed to be undergoing therapy with
a sex surrogate, in which a patient has sex with a stand-in chosen
by the therapist.
   ``Geraldo tapes at a little studio on 42nd and Broadway, so now
I can say I've appeared on Broadway,'' said the part-time actor who
also cares for an elderly man.
   Ms. Freiwald said she appeared with Bailey and played the role
of his sex surrogate on ``Geraldo,'' and appeared on a ``Sally
Jessy Raphael Show'' taped in April.
   ``It was the idea of going on national television _ from a
performer's standpoint that's pretty big,'' said Ms. Freiwald, a
full-time secretary and part-time actress.
   She said her favorite role was on a November 1986 ``Oprah
Winfrey Show'' in which she pretended to be a sex-hating woman who
had been married 14 years.
   During the taping, according to Ms. Freiwald, Ms. Winfrey came
backstage and said, ```I know this is going to be a great show. ...
Just be honest,' and I died a thousand times.''
   Ms. Freiwald and Bailey said they were asked to appear on the
shows by a Chicago psychologist-author, Dean C. Dauw, for whom Ms.
Freiwald was working as an office manager.
   ``He asked me to do it because the surrogates he does have
working for him are neither presentable or articulate enough'' to
go on television, Ms. Freiwald said.
   Dauw, who had appeared on some of the shows to promote his
books, is frequently asked to suggest guests who can give personal
accounts of sex therapy, said Linda Finnell, a producer for the
``Sally Jessy Raphael Show,'' taped in New Haven, Conn.
   ``We try to check people's stories out as much as possible, but
when you have a professional you've worked with before, there's no
reason to doubt that professional,'' Ms. Finnell said.
   ``We take every precaution to ensure a person's credibility,''
said Debra DiMaio, executive producer of Ms. Winfrey's show.
   Dauw did not return numerous messages left Sunday and Monday on
his business telephone answering machine and a woman who answered
the telephone at his Chicago home said he was in Florida. She
refused to give her name or release a telephone number where he
could be reached.
   Earlier, Dauw told the Omaha World-Herald that Ms. Freiwald
worked as an office manager and a sex surrogate and Bailey was his
client. ``They didn't play (act) anything,'' Dauw said.

<HEAD>Plane Buzzes Jackson's 30th Birthday Concert</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Civil Aviation Authority said today it is
trying to locate and prosecute a pilot who buzzed Michael Jackson's
30th birthday concert in the northern England industrial city of
Leeds.
   The airplane swooped less than 200 feet over the heads of the
90,000 fans at Roundhay Park on Monday night, the authority said.
   ``Magistrates and courts take low-flying offenses very
seriously, and so do we,'' said a spokesman, speaking anonymously
in keeping with British custom. ``It is our firm policy to
prosecute.''
   Under Civil Aviation Authority rules, it is an offense for a
pilot to fly below 3,000 feet over an event with more than 1,000
spectators without permission.
   Concert fans said they could read the twin-engine light
aircraft's registration number, and police have passed it on to the
aviation authority.
   ``It was sufficiently low for us to be concerned and report
him,'' said a spokesman for West Yorkshire Metropolitan Police,
also speaking of condition of anonymity. ``It is being considered
as a potential hazard.''
   The pilot, if convicted, could face stiff fines and permanent
loss of his pilot's license.
   The audience sang ``Happy Birthday'' to Jackson during the
concert. A spokesman for the singer said Jackson is a Jehovah's
Witness and they do not celebrate birthdays, so there was no
fanfare, gifts, cake or party planned.

   Twenty-nine people arrested while trying to
give food to homeless people in Golden Gate Park chanted ``arrest
hunger, not free food'' as police led them away.
   Police cited the activists for illegal distribution of food,
demonstrating and leafleting without a permit and creating a public
nuisance.
   ``By sending the police here, the mayor's saying it's illegal to
feed people,'' said Stephanie Hedgecoke, an organizer for a group
called ``All Peoples Congress.''
   The arrests were made Monday after about 100 members of the
group called ``Food Not Bombs'' marched through the Haight-Ashbury
district to the park, carrying boxes of food, chanting slogans and
banging pots and pans.
   When they reached the corner of the park just before noon, the
members began to set up two tables with plates of beans, melons and
other food.
   About 50 police officers, half clad in riot gear, surrounded the
group and arrested members after issuing a warning.
   ``We don't want to have a confrontation,'' said Keith McHenry,
spokesman for Food Not Bombs. ``We have been doing this for eight
years in other cities.''
   McHenry, who was also arrested, said his group supported
diverting funds for military arms to humanitarian causes.
   ``Our political message is that money should be spent on food
and housing,'' he said.
   The city had warned group members they would be arrested if they
attempted to give away food in the park, something they had done
for several months. The group said the police crackdown was the
result of complaints from local businesses.
   One resident who watched the arrests said she was disgusted by
the police action.
   ``As a citizen of the city, I was offended that this was going
on in my neighborhood,'' said Marjorie Antenore, a teacher and
12-year resident of the neighborhood. ``I was shocked by the
attitude and the riot gear.''
   The mayor's office did not return telephone calls for comment.

<HEAD>Polisario, Morocco Agree Conditionally To U.N. Peace Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Morocco and the Polisario guerrillas said today
they had agreed conditionally to a U.N. peace plan aimed at ending
their 13-year conflict in the Western Sahara.
   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said both sides ``accepted with
remarks and comments'' the Aug. 11 peace plan for a cease-fire and
a U.N.-monitored referendum in the phosphate-rich desert territory.
The text of the proposal has not been made public.
   The Marxist-led Polisario has fought for Western Sahara's
independence since 1975, when Spain's colonial forces gave up the
northwest African territory and Morocco annexed it.
   Algeria has backed Polisario's campaign, but Morocco and Algeria
restored diplomatic relations in May after years of tension verging
on war over the territory.
   In Madrid, Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez
told Spanish National Radio Spain that he viewed as ``very good
news'' the announcement.
   ``We expect this process to lead to the establishment of peace
and prosperity in this region of great importance to Spain,'' the
minister said.
   Giuliani said Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar expects
to begin a U.N. peacekeeping operation in the Western Sahara before
the end of the year. The U.N. is considering sending about 2,000
peacekeeping troops to the remote, sparsely populated territory,
authorities say.
   Perez de Cuellar will also be appointing a special
representative to supervise the peace process, Giuliani told
reporters.
   ``Through the two replies, the conflict in the Western Sahara
enters a new phase, with difficulties still to be settled,''
Polisario delegation leader Bechir Mustapha said.
   ``We have accepted with certain conditions,'' Mustapha added.
   Moroccan Foreign Minister Abdellatif El-Falali said there ``is
an accord in principle to work together with the secretary-general
for the implementation of his proposals.''
   ``A referendum can be held in the relatively near future,'' the
foreign minister said.
   Announcement of the tentative agreement followed last-minute
meetings between Perez de Cuellar and the two sides. Their deadline
for submitting responses to the peace plan was Thursday.
   Perez de Cuellar's detailed proposals included a cease-fire and
a referendum calling for the region's independence or affiliation
with another nation, most likely Morocco.
   Western Sahara covers about 110,000 square miles but had only
about 76,000 inhabitants in the last Spanish census in 1975. Most
of its people have fled to Moroccan-held cities or to refugee camps
around the Algerian oasis of Tindouf.
   The major remaining dispute now likely is to be over who has the
right to vote in a referendum.
   Polisario claims about 165,000 Western Saharans live around the
Tindouf oasis, but Morocco says most of them are not Western
Saharans.
   Polisario also claims that two-thirds of the 150,000 inhabitants
of the Moroccan-held areas are immigrants not eligible to vote, but
Morocco claims 90 percent of them are Western Saharans.
   Morocco's army has kept Polisario from major gains, mainly by
building a series of defensive walls in the desert. But King Hassan
II's war effort has been costing up to $2 million a day in recent
years.

<TEXT>
   As forest fires spread through the West, the
U.S. Forest Service is spreading the word: Help!
   The Forest Service has put out a call for temporary firefighters
to battle the hundreds of blazes scorching the West's timberlands.
   But the emergency help must endure backbreaking labor, smoke and
flame. And only local people need apply.
   Meanwhile, governors in Idaho and Wyoming called up National
Guardsmen today to help fight fires in their states.
   The Boise Interagency Fire Center has notified Forest Service
regions affected by the dozens of out of control fires that
temporary firefighters may be hired on a contingency basis, said
Mike Ferris, information officer for the center that coordinates
fire suppression in the West.
   The temporary ``emergency firefighting hires,'' or ``casuals,''
must have the physical and mental capacity to work on the fire
lines, including long days of shoveling and chopping on steep
hillsides very near burning timber, Ferris said.
   ``The job carries with it a lot of drama and romance,'' Ferris
said. ``But somedays you've got to ask yourself, `Why am I doing
this?'''
   ``What we're doing is only hiring from the local community,'' he
said. ``I've had people calling from all over the country, and some
wanting to volunteer. I've had people wanting to take their
vacation and work, if you can believe that.''
   Ferris said those interested should contact their local national
forest office, not the Boise center and not the Forest Service in
Washington, D.C.
   Applicants will undergo an aerobic stress test, which measures
the ability of the heart to recover from exertion.
   While some fire officials have set the total number of temporary
workers needed at 4,000, Ferris said each national forest must
determine its requirements and the cost of employing those extra
people.
   ``We're making assessments about our needs in the situation.
We're not saying we're going to hire 4,000 or 8,000,'' he said.
   The emergency labor is a unique situation in a unique fire year.
   Late last week, the fire center estimated that 66,000 fires had
scorched more than 3.3 million acres, mostly in Alaska.
   There are 547 20-member crews, or 10,940 regular firefighters,
battling the West's fires, Ferris said.
   Nearly 1,600 water pumper trucks are manned by 15,213 people, or
an average three crew members per vehicle. About 630 people are
flying in helicopters for aerial observation or water drops. And
2,400 soldiers have been called to the lines, Ferris said.
   That does not include the scores of people who have contracted
to cut timber, cater meals at fire camps or bulldoze lines.
   The Forest Service does not expect to have the ``casuals''
trained and fitted for fighting fires until Friday, Ferris said.
   ``We will not put them in a situation that is more than what
they can bite and chew,'' he said.

   The mysterious helicopter that swooped
into a federal prison yard where an international ``techno-bandit''
was waiting to escape actually belonged to the government, because
the plot was no secret.
   Werner Bruchhausen didn't know government agents were aware of
his plan, and he ran and walked toward the aircraft as it hovered
above the empty softball field at the Federal Correctional
Institution Saturday evening, officials said Monday.
   The helicopter belonged to the U.S. Customs Service and was
flown by a Customs agent. And Bruchhausen only got to within about
20 feet of the aircraft before he was arrested by an FBI agent and
four prison officers.
   ``Possibly 2{ weeks ago we received information at the
institution from an unnamed source that Mr. Bruchhausen was talking
about escaping from the institution,'' said prison warden Bob
Honsted.
   ``Through the monitoring of telephone conversations we were able
to piece together, along with the other agencies, certain elements
of the plot,'' Honsted said.
   Officials released some details of the foiled escape attempt at
a news conference Monday but refused to answer many questions,
citing a continuing investigation.
   After the thwarted escape attempt, the West German citizen
convicted in Los Angeles of selling high-tech products to the
Soviet Union and Eastern European countries was transferred to the
federal penitentiary in Atlanta.
   Bruchhausen, who has been at the medium- to minimum-security
facility since May 1987, was willing to pay for his escape, Honsted
said.
   ``It's our belief that a sum of money, approximately or possibly
as high as a quarter of a million dollars, was mentioned,'' the
warden said. ``There was actually $5,000 that was received in
Tallahassee as partial payment.''
   Bruchhausen could face additional charges of attempted escape
and conspiracy to escape, U.S. Attorney Mike Moore said Monday.
Those charges have not yet been filed, but a conspiracy charge has
been filed against an individual still at large whom Moore refused
to identify.
   Bruchhausen and three others were indicted in August 1981 in Los
Angeles on charges of conspiracy and violating the Export
Administration Act, the Arms Export and Control Act and federal
income tax laws.
   He was arrested May 1985 in London, extradited and convicted of
wire fraud in 1987.
   Bruchhausen allegedly smuggled a microwave receiver system,
semiconductor manufacturing equipment, a computer system and other
military and scientific items to the Soviet bloc through dummy
corporations in California and West Germany, said Customs Service
Commissioner William von Rabb.
   Von Rabb in 1981 called Bruchhausen ``one of the world's top
techno-bandits'' and said he was ``deceiving and defrauding
American businesses by selling potential high technology to the
Soviets.''

<HEAD>Students In Crowded School Get Lunch For Breakfast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some students at crowded Lassiter High
School complain that spaghetti, fish, hot dogs and pizza are not
exactly what breakfast is supposed to be. But when you eat it at
9:33 a.m., what else do you call it?
   Because only so many of Lassiter's 2,100 students can fit into
the lunchroom at one time, that's when the first lunch period
begins.
   ``It stinks,'' said Heather Harrison, 17. ``When you get up in
the morning and eat breakfast, when you go to lunch you're full.
And when you get home you pig out.''
   Last year, when the Cobb County school in the Atlanta
metropolitan area had 2,500 students _ 500 over capacity _ lunch
started even earlier.
   ``We have improved,'' joked principal Doug Allen. ``We were
serving at 9:13 a.m.; now it's 9:33.''
   From a nutritional standpoint, there's nothing wrong with lunch
for breakfast, said food service assistant Joan Greaves. ``They're
given food groups that they need to give them energy during the
day,'' she said.
   Some students don't appreciate that.
   ``They should serve grits and pancakes,'' said Michele Ramsey,
17.
   Allen said the school tried adding brunch items last year, but
the novelty wore off and students went back to the fast-food line.

   Israel objected today to a statement by U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar referring to
Israeli-occupied territories as Palestine.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel said he planned to convey
Israel's displeasure through diplomatic channels before the
convening of the U.N. General Assembly next month.
   At a news conference in Geneva on Saturday following a meeting
with Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat, Perez
de Cuellar referred to the West Bank and Gaza Strip as Palestine.
   ``These are occupied territories for me and everybody with the
exception, of course, of the Israeli government. We call them
Palestinians and call the land Palestine,'' Perez de Cuellar said.
   Liel said: ``This terminology is unacceptable to us. The future
of the territories should be decided in negotiations. Until the
situation is determined, the terminology acceptable to us is the
administered territories.''
   Perez de Cuellar was quoted last week as saying he hoped to help
negotiate an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict in the same way he
help achieve a cease-fire and peace talks in the Persian Gulf war.
   Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from
Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. The territories are home to 1.5
million Palestinians.
   The area now known as Israel was called Palestine until the
Jewish state was created in 1948.

   A 36-year-old white man accused of
lobbing a hand grenade into a crowd of blacks during a racial melee
could be charged with as many as nine counts of attempted murder,
police said.
   The brawl between club-wielding whites and rock- and
bottle-throwing blacks capped long-simmering tensions in a racially
mixed community, residents said.
   Wayne T. Langston was arrested Monday and charged with two
counts of attempted murder and with throwing an explosive device,
Manatee Sheriff Charlie Wells said.
   Langston was held in the Manatee County jail with bail set at
$150,000.
   There were no critical injuries from the blast, authorities
said. Seven people were treated for shrapnel wounds and two others
suffered minor injuries, Wells said..
   ``We possibly will be charging him with as many as nine counts
of attempted murder,'' said Wells, who described the grenade attack
was ``an isolated racial incident.''
   But residents of the neighborhood, called ``Duplex City,'' said
racial tensions have run high since the opening three months ago of
the Midway Bar, which they said is frequented by ``rednecks'' and
members of a motorcycle gang.
   It was not known whether Langston, who worked at the pub, was a
member of a motorcycle gang, Wells said.
   The fight broke out Sunday evening between about 15 blacks in
the parking lot of a convenience store and about 35 patrons of the
adjacent bar, police said.
   Whites yelled racial slurs as the confrontation grew heated,
according to witness Lynn Butler, 19. He said he saw a white man
emerge from the area of the bar and lob the grenade.
   ``He just popped the clip. He just threw it. Then in five
seconds there was a boom!'' Butler said, adding that everyone in
the parking lot scrambled for cover.
   The explosion caused about $30,000 damage to the cars and
shattered windows of surrounding businesses. ``It looked like
guerilla warfare,'' Butler said.
   Langston was arrested on warrants issued after witnesses and
acquaintances talked to police, Wells said. Police reports show
Langston has been charged twice since 1981 for aggravated battery
but never convicted.

   A 24-year-old man has pleaded guilty
to trying to sell a dozen Pink Floyd tickets to the wrong guy _ a
man who reported the tickets stolen in a house break-in two days
before.
   In an agreement, Karl C. Hubble of Detroit pleaded guilty Monday
to possession of stolen property less than $100, a misdemeanor. He
was fined $60.
   Police said Hubble was trying to sell the block of tickets
outside an Aug. 16 concert at the Palace by the British rock group.
   Douglas Coxen, 21, approached him and recognized the tickets. He
told Hubble he would be right back with more money.
   Coxen came back, along with a police officer.
   Since Coxen bought the tickets with a credit card, stadium
officials were able to confirm the tickets were his, and Coxen and
11 pals enjoyed the show.
   Police said Hubble is not suspected in the break-in or ticket
theft, and has promised to cooperate with an investigation.

   The U.N. secretary-general today blamed
disagreements over an immediate troop withdrawal and a maritime
cease-fire for stalling formal Iran-Iraq peace talks.
   ``We are trying to clear the first part (of a U.N. peace
resolution) on an immediate cease-fire and a troop withdrawal
without delay ... The cease-fire at sea is part of the problem,''
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said.
   Formal sessions between Foreign Ministers Ali Akbar Velayati of
Iran and Tariq Aziz of Iraq have been suspended since Friday. Plans
for a formal session Monday were shelved without explanation, and
no formal talks were planned today.
   Low-level talks with Iran and Iraq were continuing.
   In an interview today, Velayati told The Associated Press that
Iran would not grant Iraq any concessions which it had failed to
win in the 8-year-old war. He blamed Iraq for lack of progress in
the talks.
   Velayati said Iraq was facing many internal difficulties, adding:
   ``We think this is the main reason they are looking for some
advantage, some concessions. But if they couldn't get any
concessions during this long war with a lot of casualties, of
course they will not be able to get any concessions or anything
beyond their legal rights during the peace talks.''
   Tehran Radio today quoted Velayati as saying Iraq had raised
``unnecessary or out-of-place issues to disrupt the talks.''
   In the interview with Tehran Radio monitored in Nicosia, he said
he hoped Perez de Cuellar, the U.N. Security Council and other
nations can pressure Iraq and ``put a stop to this deviating course
... or force them to come back to the correct path.''
   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said Perez de Cuellar met with
representatives of the five permanent members of the Security
Council _ the United States, Britain, China, France and the Soviet
Union _ on Monday to brief them on the negotiations.
   Giuliani did not comment on the discussions. But diplomats
speculated that the U.N. chief was hoping the five nations would
help get the talks moving.
   Iraq has been insisting on an early reopening of the
Shatt-al-Arab waterway, which has been blocked by sunken ships
since early in the war. Iran has said clearing the waterway _
Iraq's only outlet to the sea _ should come later after a permanent
cease-fire and troop withdrawal.
   Talks reportedly faltered at the ministerial level because of
the dispute over the Shatt-al-Arab. Baghdad claims sovereignty over
the entire Shatt-al-Arab. Iran claims rights to half of it. The
issue is central to the talks because the U.N. peace plan calls for
troop withdrawal to internationally recognized boundaries.
   Perez de Cuellar said today: ``You all think that everything is
the Shatt-al-Arab _ this is not quite true. This is one of the
difficulties we are facing and not the only one.''
   Aziz said Monday that it would be impossible to advance to other
points until Iran agreed that the cease-fire extended over all
Persian Gulf waters.
   ``It is a very difficult problem and it cannot be expected that
this will be resolved in a few days,'' Perez de Cuellar said.
   The talks began Thursday to try forge a peace treaty and a
timetable for troop withdrawal and prisoner exchange under a
U.N.-mediated Aug. 20 cease-fire.
   The two countries have in the past often ignored previous
agreements on the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, a point of friction since
the days of the Persian and Ottoman empires.
   A Western diplomat trying to settle the question in 1914 called
it ``a phenomenon of procrastination unparalleled in the chronicles
of oriental diplomacy.''
   Five days before Iraqi troops invaded Iran in September 1980
after weeks of border clashes, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq
tore up the latest treaty on the waterway, the Algiers Agreement of
1975, during a televised speech.
   The agreement between Hussein, then foreign minister, and the
late Shah of Iran set the border between the two nations in the
middle of the 125 mile-long waterway, instead of its Iranian bank _
a dividing line in a 1969 agreement.
   Velayati said Monday that Iraq could not unilaterally abrogate
the 1975 treaty. But Aziz told reporters that it was ``Iran that
always abrogated previous agreements, imposing new ones by force.''
   ``This reflects the situation in the 17th, 18th, 19th and early
in the 20 centuries, right up to present times,'' he added.

   A 27-year-old swimming instructor waded out of
Lake Ontario today, the first person to swim all five Great Lakes.
   Canadian marathoner Vicki Keith took just less than 24 hours to
make the 31-mile crossing _ much faster than her original estimate
of 36 hours _ despite using the difficult butterfly stroke for most
of the swim.
   She began at Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, and was supposed to
finish her swim at the Canadian National Exhibition grounds in
Toronto, but strong currents pushed her about three miles east.
   She waded out of the lake at 6:03 a.m. EDT.
   ``I feel good. I'm glad it's over, though,'' said Keith, visibly
tired and disoriented.
   ``It was really tough because of the butterfly,'' she said, her
teeth chattering. She was taken away quickly in a van.
   During her crossing, Keith claimed a women's world distance
record for the butterfly stroke, bettering her 1984 mark of 12
miles after just six hours in the water.
   She swam the butterfly stroke for 23.6 miles across the lake _
nearly doubling her record.
   Before the crossing, Keith said she planned to switch to the
easier freestyle stroke shortly after breaking her record for the
butterfly.
   But the Kingston, Ontario, woman didn't seem to feel the strain
of the awkward butterfly _ which involves throwing both arms over
the head and doing a dolphin-like kick simultaneously.
   She started her five-lake marathon in July in Lake Erie, crossed
sections of Lake Huron and Lake Michigan later that month and
completed a 21-mile arm of Lake Superior on Aug. 15.
   The swims were organized as part of a fundraising drive to help
pay for a swimming pool for the disabled in Toronto. She has raised
half of her $243,000 goal.
   Last summer, Keith became the first person to swim across Lake
Ontario and back.

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson was booed this morning
after being accorded the honor of ringing a bell to kick off the
trading day at the New York Stock Exchange.
   Jackson had a ready explanation for the chilly reception _ he
said he was a few seconds late on the ringer.
   The civil rights leader, who is in New York for three days of
meetings with local officials and black activists, spent the early
part of the morning addressing a fund-raising breakfast of black
securities executives. Proceeds were to go to Jackson's Rainbow
Coalition.
   Then he was escorted to the exchange to start trading promptly
at 9:30 a.m. After the bell rang, apparently not promptly enough, a
handful of cheers by traders were nearly drowned out in a chorus of
boos.
   Jackson then took a walk around the floor of the exchange,
shaking hands with the traders, most of whom were already engaged
in the frantic business of the day.
   Speaking to reporters afterward, Jackson said he had been told
it was traditional to boo anyone who started the trading day late.
Anyway, he said, ``Cheers and jeers are part of Americana.''

<HEAD>Judge Orders Marcoses to Stand Trial in Wrongful Death Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos and
his wife, Imelda, must stand trial to determine whether they had a
part in the slaying of two union leaders in 1981, a federal judge
ruled.
   In a decision she said was certain to be appealed, U.S. District
Judge Barbara Rothstein denied a request Monday by the deposed
leader and his wife to be dismissed from a wrongful death suit
filed by relatives of the slain unionists. The case is scheduled to
go to trial next year.
   Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes, anti-Marcos reform leaders in
the overwhelmingly Filipino Alaska Cannery Workers Union, were
gunned down at the union hall on June 1, 1981.
   Their survivors filed suit the next year, claiming in part that
the Marcos regime ordered the shootings. The Marcoses claimed
head-of-state immunity.
   A second federal judge dismissed the Marcoses as defendants in
the lawsuit in December 1982, while Marcos was still president. In
1987, after the Marcoses fled the Philippines, Ms. Rothstein ruled
they had to stand trial, and her decision Monday reaffirmed that
ruling.
   ``Head-of-state immunity serves to safeguard the relations among
foreign governments and their leaders _ not as the Marcoses assert,
to protect former heads of state regardless of their lack of
official status,'' the judge ruled.
   ``This court believes it is neither inequitable nor disturbing
that a foreign official who takes refuge in the United States must
defend the legality of private acts committed in the United
States,'' she added.
   Other defendants in the case include the Republic of the
Philippines; Leonilo Malabed, a San Francisco doctor, and three men
who were convicted on state criminal charges in the case. The suit
says Malabed controlled a fund from which $15,000 was paid for the
slayings.
   The Marcoses fled the Philippines for the United States in
February 1986 when Corazon Aquino was sworn in as president. They
now live in Hawaii.
   In an interview Monday, Malabed said he and Marcos have been
close friends for many years. He denied that he or Marcos had
anything to do with the shootings.
   ``I have no doubt even if he stood trial in Seattle that he
would win the case because there is no evidence,'' Malabed said.
   George Greer, a local attorney representing the Philippines in
the case, said he had yet to see evidence linking Marcos or the
Philippine government to the killings.

   Two sisters with similar names and
Social Security numbers had to fight with the government for 18
months before it would admit they were not ``Medicare dead'' and
``nonexistent.''
   Chloie and Chleo Larmon didn't get anywhere with the Social
Security Administration until their congressman stepped in.
   The trouble started when Chloie needed surgery for a broken hip.
When she was dismissed from the hospital, a Medicare clerk struck
the ``deceased'' code instead of ``dismissed.''
   When Chloie filed for Medicare payments, she was told ``since
you have been declared legally dead, the executor of your estate
must send legal papers.''
   Chleo also ran into problems when she tried to apply for a
Medicare payment.
   ``They informed me I had no Medicare file,'' Chleo said. She
told Medicare officals: ``But Chloie is the one you have labeled
deceased, I'm not.''
   The sisters have almost identical Social Security numbers, with
only one digit differing.
   Finally Chleo told Childress Index publisher Morris Higley about
the situation and he advised them to contact U.S. Rep. Beau
Boulter, R-Texas.
   Within three weeks, Chloie and Chleo were alive and well in the
Medicare computer, and their checks were on the way.
   ``The Social Security Administration has corrected their records
and no longer show Ms. Larmon as deceased,'' the agency said. ``We
apologize for the delay in processing these claims and regret any
inconvenience it may have caused.''

<DATELINE>SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The five Discovery astronauts and
ground support teams today began staging their final long-duration
rehearsal before the first launch of a NASA space shuttle in more
than 2{ years, officials said.
   About 300 people at the Johnson Space Center took part in the
56-hour simulation of mission STS-26, a four-day shuttle flight,
with as many as 200 others taking part in New Mexico and
California, said spokesman Brian Welch.
   The scheduled 8 a.m. test got off to a late start because of a
malfunction in the shuttle simulator, but the problem was corrected
and countdown ended at 9:04 a.m., said spokesman Bill Green.
   Commander Rick Hauck, pilot Richard Covey and mission
specialists David Hilmers, Mike Lounge and George ``Pinky'' Nelson
will face about 150 simulated problems during the lengthy test.
   ``The people who do the simulation, the `sim' supervisors, sort
of wage a mental battle with the flight controllers,'' Welch said.
``They will do everything they can to make it more difficult. They
try to throw a problem at each major (flight) system.''
   Lounge and Nelson may have to wear spacesuits to wrestle a mock
satellite in the space center water tank, the crew may be asked to
make an unplanned landing, and early deployment of a $100 million
NASA communications satellite may be thrown off schedule during the
test.
   ``I will feel good if they work through the scenarios, if they
understand what they did and why they did it,'' Welch said.
   The rehearsal was scheduled to end by 5 p.m. Thursday, and a
full day of debriefing will follow, Welch said.
   The actual launch of the shuttle Discovery is slated for late
September or early October if sluggish oxygen valves and a hydrogen
leak are repaired in time, according to National Aeronautics and
Space Administration officials.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis today scoffed at the Republican wish
list of weapons, saying ``you can't have them all'' and still
balance the budget, while Republican running mate Dan Quayle said
Dukakis is wrong to call Star Wars a fantasy. ``It is called
defending America,'' he said.
   Dukakis finished up a two-day swing through his home state of
Massachusetts and Republican George Bush toured Kentucky today as
representatives of both campaigns opened summit-style negotiations
to hammer out a schedule for fall debates.
   ``I believe they recognize how important it is to the American
people that there be debates,'' Dukakis chairman Paul Brountas said
before he and campaign manager Susan Estrich met with Bush's
campaign chairman James Baker, media adviser Roger Ailes and
adviser Bob Goodwin.
   Baker, speaking to reporters on his way in to the meeting in the
Washington offices of Brountas' law firm, was asked how many
debates were expected. ``That's what we're here to find out,'' he
said.
   The Democratic nominee hinted strongly he would let no more
Republican broadsides go unanswered. ``If it continues you have to
respond,'' Dukakis said in Springfield, Mass. ``I think that's
unfortunate but I think it's very clear what kind of campaign the
Republicans are running. ...''
   Dukakis also cited his opposition to the mobile MX missile
system, two new supercarrier task forces and the Star Wars space
defense system.
   ``Mr. Bush says he wants them all,'' the Democrat said. ``You
can't have them all. Not if you're serious about providing the
resources our conventional forces need and not if you're serious
about getting that deficit down.''
   Bush's top surrogate, running mate Quayle, defended Star Wars in
a speech today. ``It is not a fantasy as the governor of
Massachusetts has called it. It is called defending America,'' he
said.
   In an appearance before the International Association of Fire
Chiefs, meeting in Washington, Quayle opened by saying, ``I've
become very accustomed to fighting fires the last couple of weeks.''
   Dukakis made his call Monday for a return to the rhetorical high
ground while being criticized by Democrats for letting Bush control
the debate with attacks on the Democrat's patriotism, views on
defense and gun control and a Massachusetts prison furlough program.
   Dukakis, during a tour of western Massachusetts to highlight
that area's economic resurgence, said he was ``trying to get this
campaign up where it belongs'' by discussing his economic
positions. But the Massachusetts governor also countered Bush's
attacks on the furlough program and launched his own salvo on the
vice president's support for a reduction in the capital gains tax.
   In his counterattack, Dukakis showed a newly aggressive posture.
   Dukakis said at a news conference he wants to ask Bush about the
16,000 furloughs granted to federal prisoners last year, ``some
lasting 45 days and many to convicted drug pushers Mr. Bush says he
wants to execute.''
   And in a luncheon speech before the news conference, Dukakis
said: ``We're not going to accept Mr. Bush's suggestion that the
way to build opportunity for our citizens is to cut taxes for the
wealthy again, this time with a $40 billion handout, 70 percent of
which would go to those making $200,000 a year or more.''
   Bush has criticized Dukakis for the furlough program, since
amended, because one prisoner on a weekend pass raped a woman. The
vice president also advocates the death penalty for drug dealers.
   ``Ten weeks from tomorrow, America will choose a new
president,'' Dukakis said. ``The campaign is a golden and historic
moment to define our nation's future. My friends, let us not waste
this opportunity.''
   Bush, during a tour of a defense plant in St. Louis, belittled
Dukakis for saying the United States needs anti-tank weapons rather
than MX mobile missiles, saying both systems are needed for a
strong defense.
   ``Does he understand the principles of deterrence, keeping the
peace by deterring war?'' Bush said. ``It's not a choice between
the two.''
   During a later appearance in Tennessee, Bush said Dukakis has
little standing to criticize the administration's drug-fighting
policies, saying ``he is the governor who vetoed mandatory
sentencing for drug dealers and is opposed to capital punishment
for drug dealers.''
   Both presidential contenders agreed it was time to leave by the
wayside inquiries into Quayle's background and concentrate on the
issues.
   ``The American people aren't interested in the grades that some
of us might have gotten while we were in college,'' Dukakis said,
referring to queries about Quayle's less than sterling academic
performance. ``They care about whether their children will have the
chance to go to college.''
   Bush said Quayle has absorbed a ``tremendous pounding'' over his
National Guard service and other issues, and has ``emerged to where
he will be an asset'' to the GOP ticket.
   On the issue of presidential debates, the two campaigns disagree
on the when and where.
   ``There will be an opportunity to debate, and I just don't feel
under any great rush,'' Bush said of today's meeting between top
aides in both campaigns. ``We might meet somebody halfway, but I'm
not about to be stampeded. I say, explain your views on defense.
The response is, how about debates _ totally irrelevant.''
   Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk charged that Bush is
using ``long-distance innuendo'' and ``transcontinental slurs''
while avoiding face-to-face confrontation.
   Dukakis has pressed for an earlier debate schedule than the Bush
campaign wants.
   Republicans lead in assembling campaign warchests. The Federal
Election Commission, in a report released Monday, said
contributions to the five principal Republican campaign committees
totaled $166.19 million during the 18 months ending June 30. During
the same period, the five comparable Democratic committees raised
$59.84 million.

   A federal judge ordered a convicted drug
smuggler ``removed from society'' and sentenced him to life in
prison without parole for his role in importing 150 tons of
Colombian marijuana.
   Robert Castoro, 39, ``introduced more harm and evil into this
society than a murderer,'' U.S. District Judge Patricia Fawsett
said Monday in imposing the harshest penalty ever handed down in
federal court in Orlando.
   The judge also gave Castoro an additional 65 years in prison on
drug and tax convictions and fined him $200,000.
   Castoro was convicted in July on a charge of conducting a
continuing criminal enterprise and nine other drug possession and
tax-evasion counts.
   Federal drug agents and other witnesses testified he was one of
two major figures controlling a ring that unloaded drug-laden
freighters in the Bahamas and smuggled the marijuana on speedboats
into South Florida from 1977 to 1984.

   A mayor accused of ``voodoo'' antics
undermined the legal process by granting pardons to repeat
offenders and pocketed payments of some fines, the city attorney
testified at his impeachment trial.
   Larry Grissett, the city attorney, testified Monday at the trial
of Florala Mayor H.T. Mathis that he had warned the 85-year-old
official about abusing his legal authority to grant pardons.
   Charges against Mathis, who is accused of incompetence and
damaging his small town's reputation with ``voodoo'' antics,
include wholesale pardoning of convicted drunken drivers.
   ``It's my turn (today),'' the mayor said Monday at the
conclusion of the first day of his trial in Covington County
Circuit Court.
   Early today, three of the mayor's supporters stood outside the
courthouse carrying placards that said ``Impeach Don Siegelman,''
the state attorney general who rarely appears at trials but joined
his aides at this one.
   Grissett also testified that the town of 5,000, located near the
Florida border, was forced to file suit against the mayor to
prevent him from accepting payments of some fines and depositing
them in his personal account.
   ``He was taking partial payments outside court on the
installment basis,'' Grissett told the jury. He said Mathis
deposited $225 in fines in his personal account and did not return
the money ``until I filed suit.''
   Mathis' attorney, James Prestwood, questioned Grissett about the
mayor's authority to grant pardons. The attorney conceded that
Mathis had that power, but contended that he had abused it by
granting pardons to repeat offenders.
   Siegelman and a county grand jury accused Mathis of misusing his
office by granting too many pardons for drunken drivers. The mayor
is accused of willful neglect of duty, incompetency in office and
corruption.
   Mathis, whose four-year term expires Oct. 3, attracted national
attention by sprinkling so-called ``voodoo dust'' around City Hall
and later proclaiming ``National Voodoo Week'' in Florala. He says
he sprinkled the powder as a joke.
   In opening arguments, Prestwood portrayed Mathis as the victim
of a political struggle with the City Council.
   But Councilman Lewis Collins testified that the ``voodoo''
dusting incident had damaged the town's reputation and that the
mayor offered no explanation except to say, ``When it works, he
would let us know.''
   Collins said the council had to obtain a court order to halt the
mayor from releasing people from jail.
   ``He would order the dispatcher to turn people out of jail,''
Collins said. Later, the mayor began granting pardons to those in
custody.
   In other testimony, several Florala residents who had been
arrested on minor offenses said they had pawned their cars to the
mayor in exchange for payment of fines. They said they later
reimbursed Mathis in amounts larger than the fines to get their
cars back.
   In one instance, however, Rachael Aplin said the mayor had
already sold her car to the daughter of a city councilman and she
was unable to get the vehicle back.
   Alabama officials found guilty of impeachment charges are only
removed from office, not fined or sent to jail. However, they can
face another trial for the same crimes. An official thrown out of
office can appeal the verdict directly to the state Supreme Court.

   Governors in Idaho and Wyoming called in National Guardsmen
today to bolster weary firefighters battling dozens of wildfires,
while a remote California town mopped up after lightning-sparked
blazes swept within feet of the community.
   Fire forced officials to evacuate a hospital in the remote town
for several hours.
   Favorable weather conditions Monday helped firefighters keep
blazes from gaining much ground in Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Oregon,
Washington and Utah. But the wildfires were far from out. And
dozens of fires that have been allowed to burn for months in the
vast interior of Alaska, largely in scrubland, have charred more
than 1.2 million acres.
   A fire flare-up prevented Yellowstone National Park officials
from reopening the park's south entrance today and they braced for
possible stronger wind that could whip up the fires. Firefighters
in Montana hoped to get the upper hand on fires that have blackened
almost 200,000 acres.
   In Idaho, Gov. Cecil Andrus placed the entire state under an
extreme fire emergency, releasing National Guardsmen to reinforce
2,000 firefighters battling the worst wildfires.
   But officials feared a weather front expected today would bring
gusts that would push the flames past fire lines.
   Among the priorities was the 16,000-acre Battle Axe fire on the
Middle Fork of the Salmon River in the Frank Church-River of No
Return Wilderness. It jumped the river to threaten a score of
summer homes, and an unoccupied forest ranger station and airstrip
at Indian Creek.
   In California, firefighters late Monday kept fast-moving fires
from reaching a hospital, school and other buildings in remote
Portola.
   There were no injuries in the town of 1,600 residents, and the
only building lost was a barn, as a fire shooting flames 150 feet
high was halted at the eastern edge of the Sierra town.
   About 30 patients and staff were evacuated from the Eastern
Plumas District Hospital, first to a community hall several blocks
away on the other side of the middle fork of the Feather River,
which runs through the center of Portola, and then to other
hospitals. The hospital was reopened after 5{ hours.
   Officials said an afternoon storm sparked about 20 fires around
the community, about 45 miles northwest of Reno, Nev. Most of the
fires continued burning today, blackening 1,200 acres.
   One lightning strike started a fire behind Portola High School
just a few minutes before classes were dismissed.
   ``When we walked out onto the field for (football) practice, it
was just smoking,'' said Mike Muscatt, 15, adding that within a few
minutes, ``the flames were 80 feet high.''
   In Alaska, where some fires have been burning since April, the
biggest blaze had covered more than 541,000 acres 50 miles north of
Fairbanks. But the fires do not threaten any developed property or
valuable timber, and a special interagency office handing fire
information for the state has been disbanded for the season.
   In Wyoming, firefighters in Yellowstone regained ground against
one of the tougher fires roaring in the park, sealing off Old
Faithful geyser from flames five miles away.
   Continued calm winds allowed thousands of firefighters to make
further inroads in their battle against 10 major fires, which have
charred 450,000 acres of the park's 2.2 million acres.
   That calm weather had prompted a decision to reopen
Yellowstone's south entrance for the first time in 10 days, but
park spokeswoman Amy Vanderbilt said fire activity put the area
back in danger. She would not make a new prediction as to when the
road, which has been closed for 10 days, would reopen.
   Wyoming Gov. Mike Sullivan called out 120 Army and Air National
Guard volunteers Monday to aid in the battle against a 15,000-acre
blaze near Fayette Lake in the Bridger-Teton National Forest
outside Yellowstone. The guardsmen were to go to Jackson for 32
hours of training, and the majority would then be sent to that
blaze.
   In Montana, one major fire was brought under control Monday, but
others burned on more than 187,000 acres.
   The 37,600-acre Warm Springs Creek fire, which destroyed 13
homes and cabins near Helena, was declared controlled after three
weeks, and most of the 2,500 firefighters were released, said
George Bukenhofer, fire information officer.
   Costs of fighting the blaze are expected to reach $10 million.
   The Combination fire, between Philipsburg and Drummond in
west-central Montana, grew to 10,000 acres, and firefighters braced
for gusty winds. The winds could move the flames east toward the
small community of Maxville, about four miles away, said
information officer Palmer Bowen.
   But at the 1,900-acre Lolo Creek fire in western Montana, the
winds were expected to bring safety to about 56 homes sandwiched
between the southern edge of the fire and a highway.
   All but one of Oregon's major forest fires have been virtually
contained or controlled, but the largest burned out of control
Monday in the northeast.
   The Tepee Butte fire grew to 33,600 acres of grass and timber in
the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest and the Hell's Canyon National
Recreation Area about 25 miles north of Enterprise.
   The growth from 28,000 acres was largely due to backfires set to
consume fuel in the path of the flames, officials said.
   Shifting winds in Washington state fanned worries that several
fires burning on the Kettle Range would merge to become one large
conflagration, said Diana Baxter, a spokeswoman for the Forest
Service. The Kettle Range fires on the Colville Indian Reservation
were the biggest of the blazes that have blackened more than 19,000
acres of the state's forest and rangelands.
   In Utah, firefighters contained a 525-acre fire near the
Pineview Reservoir, 25 miles east of Ogden, and moved in to douse
remaining hot spots.

   RUNDU, South-West Africa (AP) _ The last South African troops
withdrew today from Angola after fighting for more than a year in
support of anti-Marxist guerrillas.
   The armed forces chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Ian Gleeson, said at a
ceremony that nearly 1,000 soldiers crossed into South-West Africa
during the day as part of a regional peace accord.
   ``As of this moment, we are out of Angola,'' Gleeson said.
   South African and foreign journalists were flown to Rundu, on
the Angolan border, to witness what the final stages of the
withdrawal of South African forces. They saw 50 military vehicles
cross a pontoon bridge over the Okavango River before the bridge
was dismantled.
   In South-West Africa, also known as Namibia, military officials
said security forces in the past week killed 14 guerrillas fighting
to end South African rule over the territory. South African forces
also staged their first amphibious landing exercise today on the
Namibian coast.
   South African forces have been in Angola since early 1987. The
pullout from Angola is part of a cease-fire agreement that is
intended to clear the way for withdrawal of about 50,000 Cuban
troops from Angola and independence for Namibia.
   An estimated 2,500 South African troops in Angola have been
leaving since a cease-fire was declared Aug. 8.
   The Cuban troops support Angola's Marxist government in its
13-year-old war against guerrillas of UNITA (National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola). South Africa and the United States
back UNITA.
   UNITA is not party to the cease-fire and was excluded from
recent peace talks held by South Africa, Cuba and Angola under U.S.
mediation.
   There have been unconfirmed reports that South Africa has been
reinforcing its line of bases in northern Namibia.
   The amphibious landing exercise was conducted on a beach near
Walvis Bay, a South African enclave that serves as Namibia's only
commercial port. High-speed landing craft carried marines and
paratroopers ashore as part of a six-week exercise involving about
2,500 military personnel.
   The South-West African People's Organization, the main
pro-independence movement in the territory, contends Walvis Bay
should become part of a sovereign Namibia. South Africa's deputy
defense minister, Wynand Breytenbach, said Monday the port would
remain under South African control and continue to serve as a
military base.
   The South African-led territorial army said today that 14 SWAPO
guerrillas have been killed in the last week. SWAPO, considered
likely to take power if independence elections are held, has said
it will observe a cease-fire in Namibia starting Thursday if South
Africa reciprocates.
   South Africa says it will begin withdrawing from Namibia on Nov.
1 and allow the territory to hold independence elections next June
1 if Cuban troops leave Angola by the latter date.
   The four countries involved in the negotiations met last week in
Brazzaville, Congo, but failed to agree on a timetable for Cuban
withdrawal from Angola and Namibian independence. More talks are
planned next week.
   South Africa has intervened in Angola regularly since 1975 when
it invaded the country on the eve of Angolan independence from
Portugal. South Africa advanced several hundred miles up Angola's
west coast before turning back.
   South African forces returned to Angola several times in the
early 1980s, but in May 1985 announced a complete withdrawal.
Several weeks later, two South African commandos were killed and a
third was captured in northernmost Angola.
   Thousands of South African troops entered Angola in 1987 to
assist UNITA. South African generals said their maximum strength in
Angola was 3,000 men, although other reports claimed the force was
twice that size during heavy fighting last October.
   In November, South Africa said its forces again had begun
withdrawing, but most of the troops remained until this month.
   Dozens of white South African troops, most of them conscripts,
have been killed in Angola the past year. Black units, including
Angolans fighting for South Africa, are believed to have suffered
heavier casualties, but no comprehensive figures have been released.

   Federal investigators have seized documents
at Northrop Corp., apparently in a continuing investigation of the
aerospace company's MX missile contracts with the U.S. Air Force, a
newspaper reported today.
   The search was conducted last week at Northrop's Hawthorne plant
by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Defense
Criminal Investigative Service, according to the Los Angeles Times.
   Northrop officials confirmed the search Monday, saying
investigators had taken ``contractural documents between Northrop
and the Air Force.'' Such papers related to the company's
production of a key component of the missile's sophisticated
electronic guidance system.
   However, other sources told the newspaper the documents included
``a recent internal audit report detailing purchasing problems,''
and details of failure records for the guidance component _
basketball-sized device with 19,401 parts, known as the inertial
measurement unit, or IMU.
   Investigators have been looking into allegations that Northrop
overcharged the military for the components, used defective parts
in the devices and delivered them behind schedule.
   Northrop has been charged by the government with $3 million in
civil fraud, but no criminal charges.
   Officials with the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office here refused
to comment on last week's search or any investigation.

   Fire engulfed an oil refinery in

   Among the dead was an engineer working with the Indian Oil
Corp., India's largest oil company, and a day laborer, according to
Brahm Dutt, the federal minister for petroleum.
   The fire broke out at the refinery at Mathura at a railway
siding where a train was being loaded with naphtha, Dutt told

   An investigation has been ordered into the cause of the fire,
which was brought under control in four hours, said Indian Oil

   Traffic along the national highway, where the refinery is
located, was blocked for several hours, said Manavendra Singh, a

   The refinery has been criticized by environmentalists because
its sulfur emissions threaten to discolor the Taj Mahal, India's
most famous monument at Agra, 45 miles away.

   A rapid-fire pistol and an
automatic rifle were found last year at the home of Winnie Mandela,
wife of jailed black leader Nelson Mandela, a police officer
testified Tuesday.
   Lt. A. Kritzinger appeared in Johannesburg Supreme Court at the
trial of five blacks charged with two counts of murder and with
illegal possession of weapons.
   No charges have been filed against Mrs. Mandela.
   Kritzinger said he and other policemen, in two visits to Mrs.
Mandela's house in the black township of Soweto in February 1987,
found a Soviet-made AK-47 rifle in a bedroom and a Czech-made
Scorpion machine pistol.
   The lieutenant said police asked Mrs. Mandela and her daughter
Zindzi, where the pistol came from ``and got no positive response.''
   Kritzinger said such weapons normally are brought into South
Africa by guerrillas of the outlawed African National Congress
after military training abroad.
   Mandela led the ANC's military wing prior to his arrest in 1962.
The ANC has waged a bombing and sabotage campaign since 1961 aimed
at ending white minority rule.

   The Reagan administration says it
is ``reluctant to pass judgment'' on air shows, but Vandenberg Air
Force Base today said an annual flying show featuring the
Thunderbirds will proceed next month as scheduled.
   The American military considers air shows a potent recruiting
tool, but new safety questions have arisen since an accident Sunday
in West Germany in which 47 people were killed and hundreds injured
when three Italian Air Force jets collided during a high-speed air
show maneuver above Ramstein Air Force Base.
   Lt. Col. Richard Hill, a public affairs officer at Vandenberg,
said the base's Sept. 18 air show would be ``held in strict
accordance with Department of Defense and FAA regulations.''
   Hill said base officials had to submit a map of the runway area
to the Federal Aviation Administration for approval.
   Earlier today, Rep. Norman Dicks, D-Wash., said he had written
to Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci asking for a review of U.S.
policy on air shows.
   ``I think we can make these shows safer,'' Dicks said on
ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.'' He said officials should
consider requiring that spectators be moved back further from
aerial demonstrations.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, briefing reporters
Monday in Santa Barbara while President Reagan vacationed at his
nearby ranch, said the United States was assisting in the
investigation of Sunday's accident in Germany.
   Fitzwater said Reagan was sending messages of condolence to the
German people and others.
   Members of America's military aerial stunt teams have been
killed in the past, but none has ever killed a spectator. The
Federal Aviation Administration regulates the aerial teams and
limits the maneuvers they may perform.
   Fitzwater, asked whether the United States was rethinking its
position on such shows, said, ``We don't have all the details of
this incident, so we're most reluctant to pass judgment on this
episode or on air shows in general.''
   ``America has a lot of air shows,'' the spokesman said. ``We
have them at Air Force bases. Many are military-oriented. There are
a lot of private air shows around the country. It's been a long
tradition in various circumstances to have these kinds of air
shows. So we would be reluctant to make any judgments at this time.
   ``It certainly does, however, emphasize the need for vigilance
and safety,'' Fitzwater added. ``And I'm sure that those matters
will be considered. I noticed that the West German authorities did
indicate they would not have any more air shows. But at this point,
we don't have any conclusion on that subject.''
   The Navy's Blue Angels and the Air Force's Thunderbirds have
been appearing at air shows for decades.
   The Navy determined last year that 63 percent of the students
entering Navy flight school had seen at least one Blue Angels
performance. Of those, the Navy said, almost 40 percent cited the
team as a direct influence on their decision to join the military.
   A pilot was killed during a Blue Angels demonstration over
Niagara Falls, N.Y., in July 1985. The worst accident in the
history of the Thunderbirds occurred Jan. 18, 1982, during a
practice session in Nevada. Four pilots died as a team followed its
leader into the ground.
   John Leyden, a spokesman for the FAA, said Monday the agency
``wouldn't allow aerobatic maneuvers above the crowd'' or
approaching spectators.
   ``Our minimum flight line for jets is 1,500 feet from the crowd,
and we require all maneuvers be performed along that line,'' Leyden
said.
   Witnesses to the West German disaster said the Italian air
force's team of 10 jets was flying about 180 feet off the ground
and intersecting over the field from three different directions, a
maneuver that put some of the jets on a course directly toward the
crowd.
   ``Overall, the safety record for air shows in this country is
really outstanding,'' said Leyden, noting that there are more than
200 such shows staged annually nationwide.
   ``We control the air space, so it is up to us to make sure that
all operations in that airspace are conducted properly and
safely,'' Leyden said. ``The Thunderbirds and the Blue Angels put
their shows together, but we decide on a show-by-show basis whether
there is airspace to accommodate the maneuvers safely.''
   Fitzwater told reporters the administration was ``deeply
saddened'' by the accident.
   ``We extend our sympathies to the families of those killed and
injured in the crash,'' he said. ``The president will be sending
messages of condolence to the German people and to others who are
affected by the tragedy. Details of those messages are still being
worked out, but the United States government is assisting the
Italian government in investigating the cause of the accident.''
   Most of the more than 300,000 spectators at the air show were
West Germans and Americans.
   Fitzwater said a team from Brooke Army Medical Center in San
Antonio, Texas, was flying to Germany to assist in treatment of the
injured, particularly burn victims.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Secretary of Education William J. Bennett said
today many U.S. elementary schools suffer from defective curricula
and need a strong dose of the classics, rigorous math and science
and foreign language study in the 4th grade.
   Bennett held a news conference to unveil his proposed model,
called ``James Madison Elementary School: A Curriculum for American
Students.''
   He said it is a sequel to the ``James Madison High School''
model he issued last December, and he joked that this one could be
called ``Jimmy Madison Elementary School.''
   He said elementary schools generally are in better shape than
high schools, but at most ``maybe a third of our schools'' are
offering a curriculum as strong as the one he favors.
   ``If there's a crucial point here, it's the 4th grade,'' he
said. ``We see a 4th-grade slump in reading...math and science.''
   He said American grade schools probably devote more time to math
than Japanese schools do, but too much of it is spent on dull
workbooks and too often parents, teachers and students alike accept
the notion that some students just cannot handle math.
   ``We need a little more persistence,'' he said.
   ``We have put together a curriculum for all children,'' not just
for the affluent or college-bound, he said.
   Bennett, who is leaving his post Sept. 20, called it ``my final
report to the American people as secretary.''
   The report outlines what Bennett calls ``a sound elementary
school core curriculum'' from kindergarten through eighth grade in
seven subjects: English, social studies, mathematics, science,
foreign language, fine arts and physical and health education.
   Its suggested reading list ranges from the tales of Pippi
Longstocking and Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle for the early grades to ``The
Red Badge of Courage'' and ``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' for
older pupils. Bennett said he emphasized classics ``because they
are so often missing from elementary school instruction.''
   Bennett has no authority to force a single school in America to
follow any of his suggestions. Public school curricula are
determined by state and local school agencies, and private schools
are free to set their own courses. The 1979 law that created the
U.S. Department of Education specifically forbade the agency from
prescribing curricula.
   Bennett said he was just offering some free advice.
   ``I do not presume to instruct teachers _ or parents,
principals, administrators and school boards _ in the details of
their daily jobs or in the exact shape, sequence and specialized
content of their elementary school curricula,'' he said.
   The document ``is not a monolithic program to be uniformly
imposed or slavishly followed,'' he said. Instead, ``it is intended
more broadly as a statement of goals.''
   Bennett's suggestions for social studies include: American
history in each of the first five grades, world history and
geography in sixth and seventh grades, and both world geography and
American government in eighth grade.
   He would have all youngsters take either algebra or pre-algebra
by eighth grade. His science curriculum would be capped with
biology in seventh grade and some chemistry and physics in eighth
grade. He said foreign language instruction should start ``no later
than fourth grade.''
   ``We want our students _ by the end of 8th grade _ to read,
write and speak clear and grammatical English, and to be acquainted
with the varieties and qualities of fiction and nonfiction
literature. We want them to know the essential features of American
and world history, the major landscapes and nations of the Earth,
and the rights and obligations that belong to citizens of the
United States,'' he wrote.
   ``We want them to be proficient in arithmetic and geometry, and
familiar with basic principles of algebra. We want them to have
begun exploring biology, chemistry, physics and a foreign language;
to have investigated the history and practice of art and music; and
to have developed the habits of health, fitness and athletic fair
play.''
   The report profiles seven schools as models of strong elementary
curricula: Meridith Magnet Elementary School in Temple, Texas;
Miller Junior High School in West San Jose, Calif.; Blaine
Elementary School in Blaine, Wash.; School No. 59, Science Magnet,
in Buffalo, N.Y.; LaSalle Language Academy in Chicago; St. Patrick
School in Miami Beach, Fla.; and Maryetta Elementary School in
Stilwell, Okla.

   The four-man junta met today to nominate
the sole candidate _ expected to be President Augusto Pinochet _ in
a presidential referendum that could extend Pinochet's rule until
1997.
   National police troops cordoned off the Defense Ministry
building where army commander Gen. Pinochet, navy chief Adm. Jose
Merino, air force commander Gen. Fernando Matthei and national
police director Gen. Rodolfo Stange began their nomination session
at noon behind closed doors.
   Their selection will be presented for ratification or rejection
in an October referendum.
   Under the election rules established by the military government,
Pinochet _ who deposed the elected president in a bloody 1973
military coup _ and the other three junta members were to name a
single nominee and voters will vote ``yes'' or ``no'' on that
candidate.
   Pinochet, Merino, Matthei and Stange, all in dress military
uniforms, arrived one at a time at the ministry building, entering
on a thick red carpet rolled out for the occasion. None made any
remarks.
   While the other commanders arrived by car, the 72-year-old
Pinochet and his entourage of aides and bodyguards came on foot
from the government palace directly across Santiago's central
boulevard. He was both cheered and booed by bystanders.
   Both pro-and anti-Pinochet groups planned demonstrations in
connection with the nomination.
   Gen. Oscar Torres, national police sub-director, said ``we have
certainly taken some special security measures, especially in the
slums, where some day there might be problems.
   ``We don't expect serious problems,'' he added.
   Interior Undersecretary Alberto Cardemil told reporters ``there
is total and complete calm throughout the country. And I don't
think the government will need to take any extraordinary measures.''
   On Monday, police used water cannons to scatter a downtown
demonstration by women chanting anti-government slogans and urging
voters to vote ``no'' in the referendum. Witnesses said about 25
people were arrested.
   If a majority of Chile's 7.2 million registered voters cast
``yes'' ballots in the referendum, the nominee will begin an
eight-year term March 11. If a majority reject him, an open
election will be held in 1990, with Pinochet remaining in power
until then.
   The 1980 Constitution gives the junta 48 hours to nominate a
candidate. Were the commanders to fail to reach a unanimous
decision within that time, the Constitution calls for nomination by
majority decision of an eight-man National Security Council, which
includes Pinochet, navy chief Adm. Jose Merino, air force commander
Gen. Fernando Matthei and national police director Gen. Rodolfo
Stange. It also includes four other officials, three of whom are
appointed by Pinochet.
   Opposition leaders said they had little doubt that Pinochet
would win a quick nomination and called on followers to bang empty
pots and pans inside their homes tonight in protest.
   ``It will be the noisiest pot-banging ever heard,'' predicted
Ricardo Lagos, a socialist and co-leader of a 16-party opposition
coalition.
   Members of the youth wings of several opposition parties and a
communist-controlled slum dwellers organization planned street
demonstrations in central Santiago.
   The defense minister, Adm. Patricio Carvajal, warned Monday that
``the government will not allow any violent demonstrations. They
will be suppressed by police.''
   Pinochet led the coup that ousted the elected government of
Marxist President Salvador Allende in September 1973.

<HEAD>Greenhouse Effect Can't Be Stopped, Even With Less CO2</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A group of climate researchers has warned that
the ``greenhouse effect'' warming of the Earth will continue even
if there are sharp cutbacks in the use of the chemicals which cause
the problem.
   The heatup ``appears to be inevitable, even with ... drastic,
and probably unrealistic reductions, of greenhouse forcing'' by the
release of carbon dioxide and other gases, the scientists reported
in the Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres.
   The group, led by James Hansen of the National Aeronautical and
Space Administration, reached that conclusion after running
computerized climate models in an effort to predict the climate in
the future.
   The models looked at the effect of chemical releases at three
different levels: continuing rapid release of the chemicals, as in
recent years; release at slower rates, and a drastic cutback in
those chemicals.
   In the first case, the Earth's average temperature was
calculated to rise by 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit within 20 years.
   It would take 25 years for that increase in the second model.
   And even with the drastic ``and probably unrealistic'' cutback
in chemical releases, the temperature would rise that much
eventually, and probably would climb by 0.8 degrees within 15
years, according to the study.
   The greenhouse effect has drawn increasing concern recently,
although most meteorologists contend that it is too early to
determine if it is responsible for the current drought and hot
weather affecting much of the nation.
   It occurs when carbon dioxide, largely from burning fossil
fuels, and other gases _ such as methane and nitrogen oxides _
increase in the atmosphere. These gases let incoming heat from the
sun reach the Earth, but block the Earth's own heat from traveling
into space, much as a greenhouse traps heat indoors. As the gases
become more abundant, more heat is trapped and the planet's
temperature rises.
   Hansen told a congressional subcommittee earlier in the summer
that the current hot, dry conditions are an example of things to
come.
   In particular, he noted in the new report, while the average
increase in global warming doesn't sound like a lot it means
increasing frequency for hot summers. And some areas will be
affected more than others.
   If the summer outlook were a die with six faces, Hansen wrote,
the period between 1950 and 1979 would have had two faces
representing a hot year, two representing a normal year and two a
cold year.
   By the 1990s, he anticipates, that die will be ``loaded,'' with
three or four faces coming up hot when it is rolled.
   That means the chances of any particular summer being hotter
than normal would top 50 percent, compared to the 33 percent chance
of the past.
   And such a change would be large enough to affect the quality of
life, Hansen and his co-authors reported.
   For example, they noted that over the past 30 years, Omaha,
Neb., experienced a run of five or more consecutive days with a
high of 95 degrees or more on an average of 3 times in 10 years.
The climate model predicts that this could increase to 5 years out
of 10 in the 1990s and 7 years out of 10 by 2020.
   Such an increase in the number of runs of hot weather can damage
corn and other crops, Hansen warned, and can also affect forests,
water supplies, animals and people.
   A warming of 0.8 degrees in a decade is faster than any found in
historical studies and is thought to be faster than most plants are
able to accommodate.
   ``We emphasize that it is the possibility of rapid climate
change which is of most concern for the biosphere; there may not be
sufficient time for many biosystems to adapt to the rapid changes
forecast for scenarios involving rapid growth of trace gases,''
wrote Hansen and his co-authors.
   Other scientists have speculated that the increasing heat would
cause some of the ice to melt in the polar regions, possibly
raising sea levels around the world.
   The new report tends to reinforce that, by noting that the polar
regions would likely be more affected by the rising temperature
than some other regions.
   Regions where the warming showed up strongly included certain
ocean areas including the Caribbean, East Indies, Bay of Bengal,
parts of the Indian Ocean and sections of the Pacific Ocean near
and just north of the equator. In addition, the effects would be
strongly felt in China, the Kazakh-Mongolia-Manchuria area and in
the north and south polar regions, the report said.
   As to the United States, warming weather was predicted to have a
greater effect in the East than in the West.
   Seven other scientists, from NASA's Goddard Institute for Space
Studies and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed the
study with Hansen.

   A federal judge today rejected a request to
unseal search warrants and other court documents used in the search
of the homes of three men in connection with the government's probe
of defense contractors.
   The decision by U.S. District Chief Judge Alexander Harvey was a
setback for The Washington Post which had persuaded a U.S.
magistrate to unseal some of the documents in July.
   In overturning the magistrate's ruling, Harvey agreed with the
government that making the papers public could impede the
government's probe.
   Harvey also said the three Maryland men, whose homes were
searched under the warrants, had not been criminally charged. Since
they were merely under investigation, Harvey said they had a right
to privacy.

   Sometimes, Democratic vice presidential
candidate Lloyd Bentsen seems barely able to control his glee over
his Republican rival, fellow Sen. Dan Quayle.
   When George Bush first picked the Indiana senator, Bentsen
hailed it as ``good news.'' With Quayle soon swamped in
controversy, Bentsen was asked what he would do if he were George
Bush.
   ``Sweat,'' he said.
   Bentsen, 67, is one of the lions of the Senate after 18 years.
He's chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, sponsor of some of
the most important legislation of the decade, a successful
businessman and decorated World War II bomber pilot.
   By comparison, in experience and accomplishments, the
41-year-old Quayle pales _ ``not a member of the club,'' sniffed
one top Senate Democratic aide.
   And occasionally, Bentsen lets slip that he really doesn't think
Quayle measures up.
   In eight years in the Senate, Quayle has been known mostly for
his fight for President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, his
battle for the controversial federal court appointment of Daniel
Manion and a losing fight against the 60-day notification for plant
closings.
   ``I don't remember anything in particular,'' Bentsen said, when
asked if he had squared off against Quayle on any other issues.
   And he makes repeated subtle references to Quayle's youth.
   ``I certainly don't think he's too young but certainly you've
got to have some maturity'' to be a heartbeat away from the
presidency, he said at one Kentucky stop. When reporters goaded
Bentsen with questions on whether Quayle would still be on the
ticket Nov. 8, the Texan finally couldn't resist.
   ``I hope so,'' he said.
   But away from the public eye, Bentsen and his top aides are
concerned about going into debate against Quayle.
   Bentsen is younger than President Reagan was when he won the
White House, but his face looks older, especially on television.
The campaign has signed him up for coaching and makeup consultation
so he won't appear wooden when put side-by-side with the handsome
Quayle.
   And while a Senate record takes years of consistent work, a
televised debate is measured in 30-second bites. A well-briefed
Quayle, given the right format, could hold his own.
   And holding his own might be good enough to be declared the
winner, given the low expectations accorded the Indiana senator.
   ``We're on the wrong end of the expectations game, as far as the
vice presidential debate is concerned, because everyone expects
Sen. Bentsen to do so well,'' said Linda Peek, a long-time Senate
Democratic strategist who is now a private consultant in Washington.
   Other Democrats already are defending Bentsen, in advance of a
debate that may never come off.
   ``The senator is concerned about a debate because his style as a
senator is to get things done and he doesn't engage in a lot of
sparring on the floor,'' national party spokesman Mike McCurry
said. On the other hand, ``It's easy to envision Dan Quayle as a TV
talk show host.''
   Bentsen also must be careful not to bludgeon Quayle and win him
a backlash of sympathy among voters, as has occurred in the recent
controversy over Quayle's National Guard record.
   Norman Ornstein, who studies politics at the American Enterprise
Institute, says the Democrats have reason to worry about Quayle.
   ``He is not a dummy,'' Ornstein said. In past debates, such as
when he defeated incumbent Birch Bayh to win the Senate in 1980,
Quayle showed ``when he was prepared, well-briefed, and focused, he
could do all right.''
   Bentsen, meanwhile, has the difficult task of not wanting to
help the Republicans in their expectations game and also not
wanting to speak well of Quayle.
   ``It isn't in Bentsen's interest to talk about Quayle,''
Ornstein said.
   So while he clearly sees Quayle as a lesser opponent, Bentsen
must focus his attacks away from the man and back to the issues and
Quayle's conservative voting record.
   ``I don't want to get into his personal life. That I don't want
to do,'' Bentsen says.
   Then Bentsen hints about which Republican would have been a
worthy opponent.
   ``I thought it would be Bob Dole, frankly,'' he says. ``It's a
real gamble picking Quayle, and I think it's going to be proven
that way.''

<TEXT>
   Gen. Augusto Pinochet is shrewd,
combative and firmly in command of his army, implacable with
critics and tireless in what he sees as a mission from God to build
a ommunist-proof society.
   The president disdains alcohol, lifts weights and has a boxer's
physique at age 72 in which he takes extra pride because of
weakness as a child.
   He defends his authoritarian style of politics as a bulwark
against Marxism and has successfully resisted the current Latin
American trend toward elected civilian governments.
   Pinochet gained power in a 1973 coup that ousted the elected
government of President Salvador Allende, a self-described Marxist
who died during the takeover.
   Social unrest and economic chaos created wide support for the
coup and it was commonly believed civilian rule would return in a
few years.
   Instead, Pinochet banned political activity and purged Chile of
tens of thousands of leftists. Most were expelled, but human rights
groups say hundreds were imprisoned and scores were tortured and
executed.
   The army, navy, air force and national police commanders were
supposed to alternate as head of the junta, but Pinochet used
political maneuvers and the pressure of his army, the most powerful
branch, to become undisputed leader.
   He uses the military tactics of surprise and force in directing
the nation and proudly states that his character was formed in the
army.
   In recent years, especially since escaping an assassination
attempt by leftist guerrillas in September 1986, he has cited the
support of providence. Pinochet declared last year: ``God put me on
top.''
   Another result of that attempt is an obsession with personal
security. His motorcade routinely includes four carloads of heavily
armed bodyguards, a van of army commandos and an ambulance, and a
helicopter gunship often hovers overhead.
   Pinochet was born Nov. 25, 1915, in the port city of Valparaiso,
one of three children of a customs official. He ignored parental
pleas to study medicine and got into the military academy after two
rejections _ the first time because he was too young and the second
because of physical weakness.
   He filled out to a solid 185 pounds at the academy and earned a
university degree.
   An autobiography published in 1980 says he became aware of an
international Marxist threat while commanding a camp for communist
prisoners in 1948, and later lectured at the national war college
on the dangers of communism.
   When Allende became president, Pinochet remained outwardly loyal
and was named army commander in August 1973, less than a month
before the coup. Some other participants in the military rebellion
said later he was an opportunist who joined the conspiracy at the
last minute.
   Political repression after the coup earned Pinochet an
international reputation as a harsh dictator.
   That image was bolstered by assassinations of exiled critics.
They included Orlando Letelier, a Cabinet minister under Allende,
who was killed with an American assistant in 1976 when their car
was blown up in Washington.
   The general equated foreign criticism with interference in
Chile's internal affairs.
   He announced plans to reshape Chilean society and build durable
safeguards against communism. A constitution written by his
administration and approved in a 1980 referendum outlaws ideologies
based on class struggle.
   It also includes a phased return of democracy, but guarantees
Pinochet the presidency until 1989 and makes an additional eight
years possible if he wins a presidential referendum later this year.
   Pinochet introduced a free-market economic program that, coupled
with heavy foreign borrowing and an overvalued peso, produced
record unemployment in the early 1980s and nearly led to financial
collapse.
   Economic hardship inspired protests that threatened his
government. Pinochet moderated his policies, winning international
approval and even the grudging praise of opponents after five years
of steady economic growth and stability.
   He ceaselessly lashes the ``old guard'' civilian politicians he
considers too weak and selfish to protect the nation's interests,
and the attacks often are viciously personal. He recently called a
prominent but very short political leader ``a human remnant.''
   In the style of a stern uncle, Pinochet preaches patriotism,
family values and hard work. That appeals to many common Chileans,
but his rural vernacular grates on many educated ears.
   Lucia, his wife, often appears in public with Pinochet and
actively campaigns for his continuation as president. They have
three daughters and two sons.

<TEXT>
   The American novelist Susan Sontag and
writers from seven countries held a reception Tuesday night to
dramatize the imprisonment of five South Korean literary figures.
   Ms. Sontag and her colleagues are in Seoul attending the 52nd
International Congress of P.E.N., a London-based international
association of poets, playwrights, editors, essayists and novelists.
   ``To be at this gathering while our colleagues sit in prison,
some of them ill, all of them, ironically, deprived of pen and
paper, is a profound disappointment and morally troubling to many
of us,'' Ms. Sontag said.
   Honoring the writers at a reception in abstentia ``allows us to
express our admiration and support for the courage of the
democratic movements in Korea at the same time that we are
deliberating over the problems and literary concerns of writers all
around the globe,'' Ms. Sontag said.
   The last time an International P.E.N. Congress was held in a
nation where writers were imprisoned was nine years ago in Brazil,
she said.
   Delegations from Australia, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands,
Sweden and West Germany co-hosted the reception honoring the
imprisoned Koreans. The five were identified as publisher Lee
Tae-bok, writers Kim Hyon-jang and Lee Pu-yong, and poets Lee
San-ha and Kim Nam-ju.
   The mother of Lee Tae-bok read a letter from her son that said
seven years of prison has been ``unbearable spiritually as well as
physically'' and that he cherishes freedom of information.
   ``I have been isolated from the freedom of getting information,
the freedom of expressing myself, and even the freedom of love,''
Lee said in a letter dictated to his brother during a prison visit
Aug. 25. Lee is now allowed to write himself, his family said.
   He said ``struggles for more freedom could never be stopped and
will not be stopped.'' Lee's brother, his father and the editor of
the family's publishing house were also present.
   Hans von de Waarsenberg, a poet from the Netherlands, read the
beginning lines of a 70-page poem that he said led to the
imprisonment of poet Lee San-ha. P.E.N. said Lee was charged with
violating national security in his poem ``MountHalla,'' which is
about a massacre on the island of Cheju in 1945.
   Journalist Lee Pu-yong sent a message from prison read by his

<HEAD>Quayle: `Accustomed To Fighting Fires' That Plague His Candidacy</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Dan Quayle told a group of firefighters
Tuesday that since he became the Republican vice presidential
nominee he has grown ``very accustomed to fighting fires'' that
have erupted over his candidacy.
   ``Where were you when I needed you?'' Quayle asked the
International Association of Fire Chiefs.
   Since he became George Bush's running mate, Quayle has been the
subject of intense media scrutiny over allegations that he and his
wealthy publishing family pulled strings to get him into the
National Guard during the Vietnam War and into law school after a
poor college performance. Those issues, among others, have at times
threatened to overwhelm his campaign.
   ``Believe me, I feel that I am very accustomed to fighting fires
these last couple of weeks,'' Quayle said, as the group erupted in
laughter.
   Quayle, who is in Washington preparing for this week's Southern
campaign swing, said firefighters are ``heroes to America'' because
of the lives and property they save.
   ``You are really considered the heartbeat of America _
volunteers, people willing to put their lives on the line, people
that believe in themselves, people that make this country still the
greatest country in the world,'' said the Indiana senator.
   He told the group that he and Bush support increasing death
benefits for fallen firefighters as well as a strong national
defense.
   ``National defense and defending our freedom, there is no higher
cause,'' Quayle said.
   Quayle was presented with a fire chief's hat, and told the
group, ``This is going to be prominently displayed on my airplane
... right in front of where the press is sitting.''
   Quayle leaves aboard his campaign plane, dubbed ``Hoosier
Pride,'' on Wednesday for a trip south. He will stop in Louisiana,
Arkansas, Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama, Florida and South Carolina.

<HEAD>Navy Will No Longer Dump Medical Waste At Sea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy has ordered ships in the Atlantic
Ocean to stop dumping medical waste at sea, in response to
complaints involving waste that washed ashore.
   Earlier this summer, beaches in New York and New Jersey were
closed after a large quantity of waste washed ashore. The Navy was
not blamed in the dumping.
   The Navy admitted Aug. 8 that medical waste was dumped from two
Norfolk-based ships after personnel from the Navy and the Marines
were used to clean up a 26-mile stretch of North Carolina beaches
from Fort Macon to Emerald Isle. Sailors and Marines collected what
the Navy said was a trashbag full of medical supplies.
   Adm. Frank B. Kelso, head of the 300-ship Atlantic fleet, said
Monday he sent a message to all commands on Saturday to cease
dumping at sea.
   ``While only one of these incidents involved a small quantity of
medical waste attributed to Atlantic Fleet ships, these incidents
clearly dictate increased emphasis on proper disposal of all types
of waste,'' Kelso said.
   Regulations will be adopted immediately by ship commanders that
would require special handling of all potentially infectious
medical waste, he said.
   Kelso defined potentially infectious waste as disposable medical
supplies designed for use in diagnosis, treatment, laboratory
testing or training. Those items will include all sharp objects,
containers of blood and blood products, pathology specimens and
tissue, he said.

<TEXT>
   An appeals court lifted a ban
Tuesday on the Aug. 28 edition of a popular local daily that had
lampooned Yugoslavia's Communist Party chief, the official Tanjug
news agency reported.
   The district court in Split, a city on the central Adriatic
coast, rejected the demand for a permanent ban of the edition of
Nedeljna Dalmacija, ruling there were no grounds to support it, the
news agency said.
   The temporary ban was imposed by the Split public prosecutor's
office, because of a commentary that lampooned party chief Stipe
Suvar, president of the party's ruling Presidium, and other top
officials.
   ``It is hypocritical to forbid publications making fun of our
top leaders, when jokes about them are constantly being told'' by
the people, said the news agency quoted the court ruling as saying.
   It was not clear whether the prosecutor's office would appeal
the verdict.

<HEAD>US Says Global Anti-Drug Effort Led to Seizures, 1,200 Arrests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials announced today the completion
of a month-long international drug enforcement campaign that
resulted in seizure of 11 tons of cocaine, destruction of 244 tons
of marijuana and 1,200 arrests.
   Attorney General Richard L. Thornburgh said the drive involved
the unprecedented cooperation of 30 countries and international law
enforcement agencies, principally in South and Central America.
   The project, operated under the auspices of the International
Drug Enforcement Conference, also led directly to destruction of
118,000 coca plants, 13 cocaine laboratories and seven clandestine
air strips, and seizure of $3.8 million in cash.
   During the Aug. 1-28 campaign, cooperating nations intensified
border searches, located and destroyed chemical stores, increased
patrols of airports and checked highway and river points known to
have been used for illicit drug shipments.
   Authorities also were on a special alert to spot currency being
smuggled in from Europe.
   ``The statistics are not as important as the signal that has
been sent to the drug kingpins,'' Thornburgh said. ``Henceforth
they will increasingly face the combined fury of law enforcement
agencies of all nations whose people they victimize.''
   Thornburgh spoke at a Washington news conference followed by
television satellite coverage of a news conference from Bogota,
Colombia, where the International Drug Enforcement Conference was
meeting.
   Thornburgh said that hemispheric nations generally fought the
war on drugs individually in the past. Although they shared some
data, he said, ``never before has there been such systematic and
comprehensive cooperation, overcoming barriers of language,
national boundaries, legal jurisdiction and other differences.''
   The conference was set up in 1983 and includes Panama, Mexico,
Bolivia and Peru.

<TEXT>
   A delegation from Warsaw will take part in a
ceremony this week honoring the 4,000 Polish officers slain in the
Katyn Forest, although the Soviet Union is not taking responsiblity
for the World War II massacre, a government spokesman said.
   A joint Soviet-Polish investigation into the killings has not
been completed and the ``final truth'' about responsibility is
still to be determined, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov.
   For years, the Soviet government has blamed the killings in the
forest near Smolensk, 250 miles west of Moscow, on Nazi occupation
forces. The Kremlin has maintained the massacre occurred in the
fall of 1941, after the invasion of Nazi forces in June of that
year.
   But Western historians contend the Soviet state security and
police force carried out the massacre in April 1940.
   The Polish officers had been taken prisoner by Soviet soldiers
in 1939 during the Red Army's campaign against Poland.
   Since Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in 1985, the Soviet
Union and Poland have labeled the Katyn massacre a ``blank spot'' _
a taboo or disputed issue _ in the two nations' histories. They
have set up a joint commission of historians to investigate the
killings.
   One Soviet historian, A. Latshev, has been quoted as saying he
saw evidence that Soviet bullets were found in bodies exhumed at
Katyn.
   Many Poles were disappointed that Gorbachev did not mention the
Katyn massacre during a visit to Poland in July.
   Gerasimov told reporters at a regular news briefing an official
Polish delegation will witness the unveiling of a plaque at a
``memorial complex''' during a ceremony at Katyn on Thursday.
   ``A commemorative plaque will be set up there with the following
inscription: `A memorial complex to Polish officers who perished at
Katyn and a monument to Soviet prisoners-of-war will be erected in
this place,''' Gerasimov said.
   The Polish visitors plan to lay wreaths on the site, he said.
   The dedication of the plaque did not mean the Soviet Union was
accepting responsiblity for the massacre but that ``anyway, the
time has come for a monument to be built there,'' Gerasimov said.
   On May 28, Radio Moscow reported Soviet officials participated
in a ceremony the day before at Katyn at a recently renovated
monument to ``the Polish officers shot dead by the Nazis in 1941.''
The report went on to say that version of the massacre was being
reconsidered.
   It was not clear whether the monument was part of the same
complex to which Gerasimov referred. He said in a telephone
interview after the briefing he was unaware of the May ceremony at
Katyn and believed the memorial complex was still under
construction at that time.
   He said he did not know why the inscription on the monument,
which specifically blames the Nazis and gives a date for the
massacre, differs from the one on the new plaque, which places no
blame or date.

   Five U.S. warships, including the
aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy, arrived Tuesday for a goodwill
visit that Egyptian military sources said would last 10 days.
   The task force includes the missile cruiser Belknap, flagship of
the 6th Fleet commander, Vice Adm. J.D. Williams; the
nuclear-powered missile cruiser Bainbridge; the destroyer John
Rodgers; and the frigate McInerney.
   In Naples, Italy, where the 6th Fleet is headquartered, a
spokesman said the ships are on a ``routine port visit'' but
refused to say how long it would last. The Egyptian sources said
the ships will leave Sept. 9.
   Williams, who recently assumed command of the United States'
Mediterranean fleet, went ashore to pay courtesy calls on Maj. Gen.
Sherif Sadek, commander of the navy; Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Atwa, army
commander of the northern zone; and Alexandria Gov. Sayed Gawsaky.
   The United States has been Egypt's main arms supplier and
economic aid donor since 1979.

<HEAD>Portrait of Tito Used by Albanian as Weapon Against Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Albanian demonstrator used a
portrait of the late President Tito to attack a policeman in a town
in southern Yugoslavia, the state Tanjug news agency reported
Tuesday.
   It said police arrested 13 of the estimated 200 Albanians who
hurled stones at them in Kumanovo, 260 miles south of Belgrade, on
Monday night.
   The demonstrators were protesting the introduction of compulsory
bilingual education in secondary schools in the region, which
belongs to Yugoslavia's southern republic of Macedonia.
   The clash occurred after 500 ethnic Albanians gathered in front
of the town hall and demanded that schools form separate classes in
which the Macedonian language would not be used for ethnic
Albanians, who are a minority.
   The authorities, who earlier this year disbanded such classes in
favor of bilingual education, described the demonstrations as ``the
work of Albanian nationalists and separatists.''
   The protesters carried a portrait of Tito and shouted ``Better a
grave than a slave!'' and ``We want freedom and justice!''
   ``The perfidy and transparency of slogans used by the
demonstrators was unmasked when a demonstrator attacked a policeman
with the portrait of Comrade Tito,'' said Tanjug.
   Demonstrators in Yugoslavia regularly invoke the name or carry
portraits of Tito, who is still venerated, as a moral shield
against the security forces.
   The demonstration is one of the largest by ethnic Albanians
since 1981, when at least nine people died in ethnic rioting in the
neighboring province of Kosovo, where nearly 90 percent of the
population is Albanian.
   The minority Slav population of the province has recently held a
series of rallies demanding that authorities put a stop to what
they describe as discrimination by Albanians, whose actions, they
claim, are forcing them to move out of Kosovo.

<DATELINE>LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three men were shot and
killed today a few miles from the site of an IRA bombing that left
eight British soldiers dead and 27 injured.
   Independent Television News said without attribution that the
three men _ apparently armed _ were believed to have been killed by
British security forces.
   A police spokesman said the men shot to death in Omagh, 50 miles
west of Belfast, at about 4 p.m. were not members of the security
forces.
   He said the shootings occurred on the main road from Omagh to
Carrickmore, a few miles from the place an Irish Republican Army
bomb blew up July 20 near a British army bus. The officer spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The bus bomb dealt the British army in Northern Ireland its
worst blow since 1982, and brought to 26 the military death toll in
a summer of IRA attacks in the British province, mainland Britain
and continental Europe.
   This morning, four mortar bombs and 25 pounds of explosives were
found aboard a bus crossing the border from the Republic of
Ireland, police in Londonderry said.
   The bombs and Czechoslovakian-made Semtex explosives were
discovered on a bus owned by the Lough Swilly Co., a private bus
service, when it was stopped and searched at a border checkpoint, a
police spokesman said.
   They were found in luggage in the passenger compartment, said
the spokesman, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said the bus driver and passengers were being questioned but
no arrests had been made.
   The discovery followed a weekend of bombings, shootings, riots
and other violence in Belfast, Londonderry and Newry which was
sparked by the extradition from Ireland to Northern Ireland of a
convicted guerrilla and jail escapee.
   The Irish Republican Army, which is fighting to oust British
troops from the province of Northern Ireland, led the violent
protests over Robert Russell's extradition, police said.
   Security forces in Northern Ireland have said the IRA received
Semtex, a lightweight and difficult to detect explosive, in arms
shipments from Libya. Britain has held discussions with
Czechoslovakia about making it more difficult for the IRA to obtain
Semtex.

<HEAD>U.S. Reasserts Opposition to Soviets' Krasnoyarsk Radar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief U.S. negotiator at the superpower
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty review conference on Tuesday
reasserted U.S. opposition to the Soviet radar under construction
at Krasnoyarsk, saying it violates the treaty.
   William Burns, head of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency, also reiterated the U.S. commitment to the Reagan
administration's space-based missile defense program.
   The Soviets maintain that some research of the program, known
officially as the Strategic Defense Initiative and popularly called
``Star Wars,'' violates the ABM treaty.
   In a speech to the 40-nation Conference on Disarmament, his
first public comment since the treaty review conference began Aug.
24, Burns referred only briefly to the dispute and did not break
any new ground.
   He said the United States believes the Krasnoyarsk radar ``is a
significant violation of a central element of this treaty, and that
measures must be taken to resolve this serious problem.''
   The United States maintains the radar violates the 1972 treaty
because it is not located on the periphery of the country, facing
outward, as the treaty stipulates that missile-tracking radars must
be.
   The ABM treaty restricts each side to deploying only one ABM
system, comprising a radar and anti-ballistic missiles. The aim is
to prevent either side from creating a full nationwide protective
network, under the theory that neither side would launch a nuclear
attack if it feared devastating retaliation.
   The two sides are holding their third review conference in
Geneva. Under the treaty, such a review must be held every five
years to allow both sides to air their grievances.
   The Soviet Union has charged that some ``Star Wars'' research
violates the ABM treaty, though it has not made clear in public
statements where it draws the line.
   Burns said the proposed system is not a bargaining chip. ``We
will research it, test it, and, if it works, deploy it,'' he said.
   In his wide-ranging speech, Burns also warned about the dangers
of the nuclear weapons proliferation.
   ``It is indeed ironic that just when the two major nuclear
weapon states have agreed to destroy their intermediate range
nuclear forces, similar weapons systems appear to be spreading to
other regions of the world,'' he said. The spread ``will only
create new'' security problems, he said.
   Burns also said the upcoming U.S. presidential election would
not affect the U.S. commitment to the search for a comprehensive
ban on chemical weapons, saying it is ``an enduring, bipartisan
commitment.''
   The Disarmament Conference has been trying to negotiate such a
ban for about 19 years.

   Taxicab passengers headed for church can
put an extra dollar in the collection plate _ or their pockets _ on
Sundays thanks to a new fare discount approved by the City Council.
   But they'd better be serious about praying.
   ``If it's abused, like if some people get out and walk around
the back of the church, then the mayor said the rebates will
stop,'' City Attorney Bryant Aldridge said Tuesday of the new
$1-off-on-Sundays deal.
   The heavenly discount was offered last week by the city's only
cab company, Red Bird Cab Co., when it received approval for a rate
increase, Aldridge said.
   At that time, council member David Baker requested the discount
for people who ride taxicabs to church because buses don't run on
Sundays in the central North Carolina city, the attorney said.
   The dollar-off deal applies only during Sunday morning church
hours and may be denied if the cab driver suspects the rider is not
going to church, Mayor Roy Culler said.

   Drunken drivers will have to pay for city
services when they're arrested or cause an accident under an
ordinance approved by City Council.
   ``This is intended to act as a deterrent and recoup some city
dollars from folks who drive impaired,'' said Councilman Charlie
Creamer, who introduced the measure approved Monday night.
   The city ill bill drunken drivers for the cost of sending
police, fire, rescue or city public service teams to an accident.
Drivers who are stopped by police and found to be impaired by
alcohol or drugs also will pay for being arrested.
   Those acquitted in court could get refunds.
   Creamer said state lawmakers and officials from several
communities have called him to get more information about the
ordinance.
   Exact amounts to be billed offenders still are being calculated,
and City Council also must adopt administrative rules for the plan,
which is expected to take effect in 30 days.
   San Jose, Calif., already bills drunken drivers and has been
sending out bills from $120 to $400, according to police there. It
collected $153,000 in the first seven months of the program.
   Some people spoke out against the ordinance.
   Joe Covello, a bar owner, called the ordinance discriminatory
and asked why speeding and reckless drivers should not be billed,
too. Al Chapman said if the drivers are billed before conviction,
it is ``part of a trend of carelessness with people's rights.''

<TEXT>
   Sandinista troops are patrolling in
rural areas, undergoing intensive training and staying on the alert
during a fragile cease-fire with Contra rebels.
   The government's combat units have spent time regrouping, and
farmers in this combat area about 80 miles northeast of Managua
said they have been able to plant crops despite lingering tension.
   Each side has charged the other with violating the cease-fire
during the five months it has been in effect, but the Sandinistas
recognize their advantage. ``The Contras don't have much of a
possibility of major attacks,'' said Defense Ministry spokeswoman
Maj. Rosa Pasos in a recent interview in Managua.
   Most of the Contras trying to overthrow the Sandinistas have
holed up in Honduras and they are continuing to train new fighters
and ask for weapons from the United States.
   Each side says the other is planning for renewed combat, and
Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo recently charged both
sides with preparing to renew the almost seven-year war.
   The 9-year-old Sandinista government and Contra leaders signed a
cease-fire agreement March 23, three weeks after the U.S. Congress
cut off military aid to the rebels. Talks to define the pact, which
called for democratic reforms and an end to rebel attacks, broke
off June 9.
   Contra officials and Sandinistas estimate that some 2,000 rebels
remain inside Nicaragua, mostly in the rugged northern mountains.
   Peasants in eastern Matagalpa, a northern province that has seen
heavy combat during the war, said Contra rebels ambushed several
civilian cars and military vehicles recently on the remote dirt
roads.
   Many motorists venturing along the rutted 20-mile stretch from
Matiguas to Rio Blanco, a longtime Contra route, fly white flags to
mark their neutrality while journeying through the area.
   ``This road runs along the Contra corridor to the north to
Honduras,'' a Sandinista military officer, Jose Ortega, said at the
Rio Blanco base overlooking steep hills. ``Here you can't say any
road is safe.''
   Ortega said the rebels, most in torn uniforms or civilian
clothes, kidnapped more than a dozen civilians recently.
   In the town of Matiguas, several residents said the combat in
the region was sharply reduced but that an air of tension remained.
   ``It's quiet by comparison,'' said farmer Jose Sequira. ``But we
just wait and see.''
   The farmer and government officials said the lull in the war
meant many peasants planted crops this spring for the first time in
several years.
   ``But we don't know if we'll be able to reap the harvest,'' said
Sequira.
   A series of informal talks started by Sandinista troops with
Contra combatants ended in May. An army officer said the rebels
responded to messages with bullets.
   Contra leader Enrique Bermudez said recently the chats were
``part of a Sandinista trick to dismantle us one by one.''
   Contra officials report that most of their forces fled during
the past four months to tent camps in eastern Honduras, where more
than 9,000 combatants are receiving U.S.-supplied food and uniforms.
   Rebel commanders said recently they are prepared to return to
the battlefields in Nicaragua but needed weapons, denied by the
U.S. Congress since Feb. 29. Many are now armed with rusted
Soviet-designed Kalashnikov rifles.
   The Sandinistas, supplied by the Soviet Union, last year
received $505 million in war supplies, according to the Pentagon.
The Nicaraguan Defense Ministry spokeswoman said shipments were
arriving this year ``as usual,'' but declined to elaborate.
   Army troops, Pasos said in an interview, were moving into areas
where Contra presence had been strong and were seeking civilian
support by backing health and educational services.
   At rebel base camps in Honduras, Contra officials said the
Sandinistas are getting ready for an attack aimed at finishing the
Contras once and for all.
   The Sandinista troops, Pasos said, were refining combat skills,
looking at new tactics to counter Contra ambushes and staying in
the field.
   ``Our combat troops are in position,'' Pasos said.
   Asked about any plans to reduce Nicaragua's 80,000-strong armed
forces, the largest in Central America, she replied: ``For what?
The war hasn't ended.''
   More than 26,000 people have been killed since the fighting
started in 1981, a 18 months after the Sandinistas overthrew
dictator Anastasio Somoza.

<HEAD>Brezhnev Son-In-Law Could Be Sentenced to Death, Spokesman Says</HEAD>

   The son-in-law of the late Soviet leader Leonid I.
Brezhnev could be sentenced to death if convicted next week of
giving and accepting hundreds of thousands of rubles in bribes, a
government spokesman said Tuesday.
   The trial of Yuri Churbanov and eight other former government
officials starts Monday in Moscow and is expected to last 1{ to two
months, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said at a
regular news briefing.
   The group will be tried before the military collegium of the
Supreme Court, and 200 witnesses are scheduled to testify,
according to Gerasimov.
   The investigation of Churbanov and the others has become a
sensation in the press, which for more than a year have taken
advantage of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or
openness, to report widespread corruption, nepotism and organized
crime. The reports usually center around Churbanov, who married
Brezhnev's daughter, Galina, in 1971, and a crime racket with which
he was allegedly involved in the republic of Uzbekistan.
   The Communist Party daily Pravda published a detailed report on
the case Tuesday.
   Pravda described Churbanov, appointed deputy interior minister
in 1980, as a power-hungry man who used family connections for
criminal purposes. It said he thrived during the rule of Brezhnev,
who served as leader from 1964 until his death in 1982.
   ``A phenomenon of the stagnation years was the practice of
making decisions in private about nomination of people to the
highest positions, and a person was judged by his family status and
the ability to please this or that clan, and not by his business
qualities,'' the newspaper said.
   The Tass news agency has reported that Churbanov is accused of
accepting bribes totaling more than $1.1 million, equivalent to 270
years' pay for the average Soviet factory worker.
   Gerasimov said Churbanov could face execution by firing squad
because he is charged with serious economic crimes. He noted that a
new version of the criminal code being drafted would reduce the use
of capital punishment for economic crimes, but that this change had
not yet taken effect.
   Selected foreign reporters will be allowed to attend the first
and final days of the trial, he said.

   The redesigned space shuttle booster
performed to near-perfection during a critical firing earlier this
month despite being peppered with intentional flaws, Morton Thiokol
announced Tuesday.
   ``It was as near perfect a test as you can imagine,'' spokesman
Rocky Raab said. ``The test was so perfect that everyone associated
with it has taken leave. Brother, there's nobody out at the plant.''
   Raab said workers had completed disassembly and primary analysis
of the 126-foot-long solid-fuel booster tested Aug. 18 at Morton
Thiokol's northern Utah plant 25 miles west of Brigham City.
   Success of the firing, the fifth and final qualifying test
required before Thiokol's redesigned booster is cleared for flight,
was critical to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
plans to resume shuttle missions, grounded since the Challenger
disaster 2{ years ago.
   NASA says it plans to launch the shuttle Discovery in late
September or early October if sluggish oxygen valves and a hydrogen
leak are repaired in time.
   Raab said NASA and Morton Thiokol engineers have ``gotten all
the primary results'' from their painstaking examination of the
rocket. All that remains is mostly computer analysis of the ``more
minor details'' of the test-firing, he said.
   Meantime at Space Center, Houston, the five Discovery astronauts
and ground support teams began staging their final long-duration,
pre-launch rehearsal Tuesday.
   The crew will face about 150 simulated problems during the
lengthy test.
   Morton Thiokol's $20 million, two-minute test-firing culminated
its efforts to redesign the booster, blamed for the Jan. 28, 1986,
Challenger explosion.
   A presidential commission found that a faulty O-ring seal on one
of the rocket's joints failed during launch, allowing super-hot
gases to escape and ignite an exterior fuel tank. The Challenger
and its seven-member crew were destroyed in the subsequent blast.
   For the Aug. 18 test, two of the rocket's three field joints,
the case-to-nozzle joint and the igniter-to-case joint were
peppered with 14 intentional flaws.
   One field joint was left unflawed for use in comparison.

   The chairman of George Bush's campaign said
today that the Republican nominee was willing to have two debates
with Michael Dukakis and a third between their running mates, but a
meeting between leaders of the two campaigns ended with no
agreement on a set of face-to-face confrontations.
   Top officials of the two presidential campaigns met for nearly
two hours with James A. Baker III, chairman of the Bush campaign,
saying that they were willing to hold two debates with the first
coming as early as Sept. 22, subject to agreement on a format and
other considerations.
   Dukakis campaign chairman Paul Brountas and campaign manager
Susan Estrich said after the meeting that the campaign would like
additional presidential debates and that the Bush campaign leaders
had not agreed to specific dates and places for the debates.
   ``I believe that we will have debates, we will have more than
one debate because it's in the best interest of the American
people,'' Brountas said.
   Baker said, ``we're not afraid'' of holding a third debate
between Bush and Dukakis. But he said, ``Debates have a way of
freezing campaigns,'' and added, ``it's our view that a campaign is
a continuing debate.''
   The two sides agreed to continue negotiations on Thursday.
   Baker, the vice president's media adviser, Roger Ailes, and
adviser Bob Goodwin met privately with Brountas and Estrich in the
Washington offices of Brountas' prestigious Hale & Dorr law firm.
   The meeting came as the rhetoric escalated over Bush's delay in
agreeing to a specific debate schedule.
   ``There will be an opportunity to debate, and I just don't feel
under any great rush, frankly,'' Bush said while campaigning in St.
Louis. ``We might meet somebody halfway, but I'm not about to be
stampeded.''
   Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk charged that Bush is
using ``long-distance innuendo'' and ``transcontinental slurs''
while avoiding face-to-face debate. The Dukakis campaign, which has
already accepted a bipartisan commission's plan for four debates,
said the next move was up to Bush.
   ``The Bush campaign has been ducking these debates, and it's up
to them,'' said Leslie Dach, Dukakis' communications director.
``We've got a plan, and it's a plan that's been agreed to by both
parties. If they aren't willing to follow that plan, we've got to
hear from them.''
   Janet Brown, executive director of the bipartisan Commission on
Presidential Debates, said she had been asked by each campaign to
meet with them separately after the Baker-Brountas session. The
commission set up the debates with the participation of both party
chairmen.
   Brown said that while the Bush campaign has voiced a willingness
in principle to debate, ``I don't think they'd like more than the
minimum number. My sense is they want two. We all know publicly the
Dukakis people want more than that.''
   Baker said last week it was unlikely a debate could take place
before Sept. 20 _ effectively ruling out the commission's first
scheduled debate Sept. 14 in Annapolis, Md., and an even earlier
proposal by the League of Women Voters.
   ``I see the statements that have been made recently as opening
negotiating positions,'' Brown said in a briefing for reporters.
   The League of Women Voters, sponsor of fall debates in the last
three presidential elections, is pushing its own package of four
debates.
   Nancy Neuman, president of the league, said: ``We're definitely
in the thick of it. Don't count us out.''
   The league's proposal is for a debate Sept. 8 in Birmingham,
Ala. Other debates would be held Oct. 6 in Minneapolis, Minn.; Oct.
23 in Boston; and Nov. 1 in Los Angeles. She said the debate in
Boston, Dukakis' home, would probably be for vice presidential
candidates.
   Brown said the commission could hold a first debate in Annapolis
on a later date. But she said there were few fall evenings
available that would not conflict with television network
obligations to cover the World Series, the Summer Olympics and
professional football.
   The commission wants other debates on Sept. 25 in Winston-Salem,
N.C.; Oct. 11 in Omaha, Neb.; and Oct. 27 in Pittsburgh. The Omaha
debate could be for the vice presidential candidates, Brown said.

<HEAD>Polisario, Morocco Agree on U.N.-sponsored Peace Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY CZUCZKA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marxist-led guerrillas and Morocco agreed
conditionally Tuesday to a plan for a U.N.-supervised cease-fire
and a referendum on the future of the disputed Western Sahara.
   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said both sides accepted the
plan for ending the 13-year conflict over the phosphate-rich
Western Sahara ``with remarks and comments.'' He declined to
elaborate.
   The Polisario guerrillas have fought for Western Sahara's
independence since 1975, when Spain's colonial forces gave up the
northwest African territory and Morocco annexed it.
   Algeria has backed Polisario's campaign, but Morocco and Algeria
restored diplomatic relations in May after years of tension verging
on war.
   In Madrid, Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez
told Spanish National Radio Spain that he viewed the announcement
as ``very good news.''
   ``We expect this process to lead to the establishment of peace
and prosperity in this region of great importance to Spain,'' the
minister said.
   Giuliani said Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar expects
to begin a U.N. peacekeeping operation in the region before the end
of the year. The U.N. is considering sending about 2,000
peacekeeping troops to the remote, sparsely populated territory,
authorities say.
   Perez de Cuellar will also be appointing a special
representative to supervise the peace process, Giuliani said.
   The Aug. 11 peace plan includes the cease-fire and a referendum
on the desert territory's independence or affiliation with another
country, which would probably be Morocco. Details of the proposal
have not been made public.
   Determining who is eligible to vote in the referendum is
considered the chief sticking point.
   Moroccan Foreign Minister Abdellatif Filali said a referendum
could be held ``in the relatively near future ... under good
conditions'' but cautioned that his side is waiting for U.N.
proposals on details of staging the vote.
   Bechir Mustapha, Polisario's No. 2 man, said his side ``accepted
the formulation of the question that will be put to voters'' in a
referendum.
   Polisario agrees to consider a 1974 census, taken when the
region was under Spanish control, ``as basis'' for counting Western
Saharans, Mustapha said.
   Mustapha said Polisario's main remaining concern is ``the future
of the Moroccan administration and army,'' and that details of
their retreat would have to be settled through negotiations. ``We
have accepted with certain conditions,'' he said.
   The Organization of African Unity will have to play a major role
in helping monitor a future accord along with the United Nations,
Mustapha added.
   Filali and Mustapha gave Perez de Cuellar their replies to his
peace plan offering in separate meetings at Geneva's U.N. office.
The two sides were given a deadline of Thursday to submit responses
after meeting Perez de Cuellar on Saturday for final clarifications
on his plan.
   The Western Sahara covers about 110,000 square miles but had
only about 76,000 inhabitants in the last Spanish census in 1975.
Most residents have fled to Moroccan-held cities or to refugee
camps around the Algerian oasis of Tindouf.
   Polisario claims about 165,000 Western Saharans live around
Tindouf, but Morocco says most of them are not Western Saharans.
   Polisario also claims that two-thirds of the 150,000 inhabitants
of the Moroccan-held areas are immigrants not eligible to vote, but
Morocco asserts 90 percent are Western Saharans.
   Morocco's army has kept Polisario from major gains, mainly by
building a series of defensive walls in the desert. But King Hassan
II's war effort has been costing up to $2 million a day in recent
years.

   A mountain lion possibly intended as a religious
sacrifice was rescued from a cage in a junkyard, a state official
said Tuesday.
   The animal was found after an anonymous tipster said he was to
take part in a rite of the Cuban-based religious cult Santeria,
said Lt. Jim Huffstodt of the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish
Commission.
   The caller said the mountain lion was being held in a cage in a
Miami junkyard.
   Wildlife Inspector Tom Quinn, who checks zoos, pet stores and
private residences to ensure wild animals are treated well, rushed
to the site Monday.
   ``Tom found where somone was living, and found a Western
mountain lion in very bad condition _ it had certainly been
neglected,'' Huffstodt said. He said authorities did not know where
the 50-pound female cat had come from.
   ``We are looking for the guy,'' said Huffstodt.
   The game commission took the mountain lion to a special camp in
the Everglades to be treated, Huffstodt said.
   Santeria is an Afro-Cuban religion created when Caribbean
plantation owners taught their Roman Catholic beliefs to slaves,
who then merged their native religion with Christianity.
   Practitioners seek favors or advice from their gods with such
offerings as fruit, cigars, or sacrificing chickens, pigs or goats.
   Adherents say the animals are not mistreated before slaughter.
   Experts believe about 40 percent of South Florida's Hispanic
community, or about 1 million people, experiment in Santeria, and
anthropologists estimate that related, similarly derived religions
have 100 million followers in Latin America and the United States.
   Animal sacrifices by priests of the religion have caused
protests in South Florida, but efforts to ban the practice have
failed.

   Republican nominee George Bush said
today that the United States should avoid gambling with its future
by electing Michael Dukakis, who is ``another liberal governor
coming out of nowhere.''
   The vice president, who continued his strong defense theme of
recent days, sought to depict his Democratic rival as inexperienced
and weak on defense.
   During a tour of a Bendix defense plant, which Bush said ``keeps
the muscle of our defense strong,'' the GOP nominee suggested that
Dukakis favors ``unilateral cuts in the muscle of the United
States.''
   Later, as he addressed a $500-a-ticket party fund-raiser in a
private residency, Bush said that while he didn't ``want anything
to do with tearing down'' the character of his Democratic rival,
``We should not gamble America's future on another liberal governor
coming
   On Monday afternoon, the feisty, tough-talking Bush was in high
gear, firing up a college crowd at Middle Tennesse State University
in nearby Murfreesboro.
   He railed against Dukakis, accusing him of being weak on
defense, soft on crime, in favor of new taxes and guilty of poor
judgment and a ``liberal bias.''
   Using an applause line that he has all but worn out since the
Republican National Convention two weeks ago, he said that if
Congress ever tried to insist that as president he raise taxes, he
would say, ``Read my lips _ no new taxes.''
   When he went down to shake hands in the front of the outdoor
rally of some 3,000 to 4,000, the crowd surged forward, hands
reaching out excitedly.
   ``I thought that was good,'' Bush later told reporters when
asked how he felt about the enthusiasm of his supporters.
   The combative and buoyant George Bush has been delighting
supporters in city after city since the New Orleans GOP convention,
as he speaks with a confident voice that seems to have been waiting
until after the convention to project itself.
   His apparent ease with the new image stood in contrast with a
Monday morning speech in which he slipped into his old low-key
style addressing employees of a defense contracting plant near St.
Louis.
   While some of the new rhetoric was there, the tone was more
measured, recalling a style that was prominent in the primary
campaign.
   Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, said that was because Bush
wanted to lay out substantive material on the differences between
himself and Dukakis, mostly on defense.
   ``I think there will be times when he'll give more serious
speeches, particularly when we move off of one set of issues into
another,'' Fuller said.
   But for now Bush is having a good run with the more feisty
style, which, coupled with improved standings in the polls, has him
in a relaxed, good mood.
   Fuller said the campaign has not conducted polling yet to see
how the new tough image is working, but ``We've certainly noted a
lot more enthusiasm in the crowds.''
   ``Now that we're in this phase of the campaign it certainly
helps to build up enthusiasm,'' he said.
   Fuller said the campaign looked at the convention as ``designed
to be a break with the past and the convention was an opportunity
to move from being Vice President George Bush to candidate George
Bush.''
   ``As a candidate he's felt compelled to draw distinctions
between himself and his opponent,'' Fuller said.
   And so Bush has turned up the heat meter on Dukakis, sharpening
his rhetoric and raising his voice as he tells audiences it's
important to show the ``enormous differences'' in their positions.
   Furthermore, Bush told reporters on Monday morning, he doesn't
intend to be ``stampeded'' into conforming to a debate schedule
favored by Dukakis.
   ``I say, `Explain your views on defense,''' he said. ``The
response is,`How about debates?' _ totally irrelevant.''
   Bush's campaign chairman, James Baker, was meeting today with
his counterpart in the Dukakis campaign, Paul Brountas, to discuss
the debate matter. Bush headed to North Carolina for a one-day
campaign trip.
   Campaigning at a defense plant near St. Louis, Bush belittled
Dukakis for his opposition to a number of weapons systems.
   ``Sometimes he give me the impression he's against every new
weapons system since the slingshot,'' he said.
   Bush said it didn't bother him a bit that he and running mate
Dan Quayle differ on some policy issues and that the Indiana
senator didn't know Bush headed a presidential panel on drug
interdiction.
   ``We're so much in sync on broad issues, you don't expect
everybody to be in agreement on every single `t' being crossed or
`i' being dotted,'' he said when asked about positions he espouses
that Quayle voted against in Congress.

<HEAD>ON QUAYLE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Toronto Globe and Mail, Canada (independent): ``None of Mr.
Quayle's sins is mortal, but their cumulative effect is
considerable. As the sharks go to work, the shreds of evidence
indicate that Mr. Quayle is a man of modest talents who has failed
to impress teachers and colleagues.
   ``Mr. Bush and the Republicans face more heavy weather about Mr.
Quayle's fitness to stand a heartbeat away from the most important
job in the world. They deserve it.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _The Independent, Britain (independent): ``America's and the
world's first question about George Bush's running mate _ Dan who?
_ has been comprehensively answered. ... The ... more important
question _ can we image, or could we trust, a President Quayle? _
will not vanish so easily. Three of the last nine presidents were
replaced by their deputies before the end of their term. ...
   ``The furore about the Indiana senator's decision to join the
National Guard rather than go to Vietnam in 1969 is beginning to
subside. ... It is not, however, the 22-year-old but the
41-year-old Quayle whom the American people are being asked to
elect. Far more disturbing than his response to a messy moral
choice two decades ago is his reaction ... to personal crisis and
the pitiless logic of politics in the big league. The most serious
charges against Mr. Quayle _ callowness and shallowness _ were
suggested by his first arm-flapping, finger-jabbing appearances
alongside George Bush in New Orleans, before the Vietnam issue
fully emerged. They have been confirmed by his evasive and
disjointed responses to the Vietnam question, essentially seeking
to make the issue one which it is not: the honor of the National
Guard. The qualities the United States, and the world, has most
reason to wish for in the American president are courage and
coolness under fire. Dan Quayle has shown little of either so far.''

   _Las Ultimas Noticias, Santiago, Chile (conservative): ``George
Bush has ahead of him the task of convincing voters that he is a
capable leader. It's an uphill job. ...
   ``Bush must also fight to keep the support _ and the
contributions _ of the Republican Party's most conservative groups
which do not fully trust him because they see him as a
representative U.S. East coast liberal wing.
   ``His strategy is to show Dukakis as a representative of the
Democrats' most liberal wing whose policies include to increase
spending and taxes.
   ``Bush trusts that, in the end, voters will seek the security of
keeping in power a party and a man promising them to maintain
economic growth, a curbed inflation and unchanged taxes. That is
why in his speech accepting the nomination he said Dukakis
represents `the liberal ideology that has failed'.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Le Figaro, Paris (conservative): ``George Bush's adversary is
Michael Dukakis. But his real problem is Ronald Reagan. After eight
years and two terms, the president is still loved by the crowds;
the vice president has only the esteem of the experts. Reagan
electrifies the man in the street with his patriotic speeches,
makes him laugh with gaffes which are generally forgiven right
away, draws tears from his eyes by reducing the grand events of
history to tales full of good sentiments. Serious and measured,
informed and didactic, Bush puts his listeners to sleep. ...
   ``Bush therefore cannot win in November except by setting
himself off from Reagan. Expert in the art of nuance, he must prove
his firmness. Instinctive partisan of compromise, he must show he
can make tough decisions.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _The Times of London (independent): ``Mr. Dukakis has made much
of his managerial image. This seems to appeal to the country after
Mr. Reagan's hand-off rule _ and its damaging outcome in the
Iran-Contra affair. In a Bush presidency, policy is more likely to
be managed by the president, and not left in the hands of the Foggy
Bottom foreign policy establishment. Mr. Bush has, after all, done
much more managing. His problem is that the appearance belies that
fact. Prosperity at home ought also to be a strong card for Mr.
Bush. The fact that after last October's Black Monday the U.S.
economy did not plunge into a recession or soar with inflation can
be seen as a victory for the management of the economy. But
American confidence in a prosperous fugure is not strong. Mr.
Dukakis can claim to be able to do better, and lumber the vice
president with some of the less attractive economic leftovers of
the Reagan years. ... Bush is not built for presidential
campaigning. He has no clear saleable identity. He is not quick. He
is not even consistenly clear. ... But he does understand the
dangers of the world in which he aspires for leadership. From here
that is no small thing in his favor.

   As President Reagan relaxed at his
mountaintop ranch, the White House marked the 25th anniversary
Tuesday of the U.S.-Soviet hot line intended to reduce the risk of
accidental war.
   During the Reagan administration, a rapid facsimile capability
was added to the Teletype system previously set up to provide
instant communication between Washington and Moscow.
   ``Such measures complement our efforts to negotiate deep,
equitable and effectively verifiable reductions in U.S. and Soviet
nuclear arsenals,'' the White House said in a statement.
   ``Although used infrequently, the hot line has permitted
American presidents to communicate with Soviet leaders to reduce
the risk of conflict which might result from accident,
miscalculation or misunderstanding,'' the statement said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president and
Mrs. Reagan went horseback riding Tuesday in warm, sunny weather at
their ranch north of here. As usual, he said, the president also
took care of routine paperwork and chopped some wood.

<HEAD>Gadhafi Criticizes Killing of Political `Deviates'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCES D'EMILIO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi has
criticized the killing of political ``deviates'' in his country,
saying the executions have given his revolution a bad name.
   In a speech broadcast on state television Monday night, Gadhafi
also called for more political participation by Libyans and
encouraged the development of black markets.
   The speech, delivered three days before the 19th anniversary of
the coup that brought him to power, was addressed to a convention
of revolutionary committee members. The committees are assigned
with safeguarding the principles of his revolution.
   Gadhafi said he was aware that people who had deviated from the
course of the revolution had ``infiltrated'' some committees. He
said they were deviant in ``conduct and opinion''
   He noted that the committees took it upon themselves to execute
only some of these deviates. This arbitrary reaction caused the
``masses to come to hate'' the revolutionary commitees, he said.
   According to the Arabic version of the speech by the official
news agency JANA, Gadhafi said, ``We want the people to govern
themselves.''
   JANA's official English version of the speech, which was
delivered in Arabic, did not carry the criticism about the
political executions.
   Gadhafi also declared that Libya's growing black market economy
was a positive development that should be encouraged, calling it
``revolutionary,'' since it is want the people want.
   In the past year, more consumer goods began making their way
into Libya, especially after Gadhafi eased restrictions with
neighboring Tunisia. Now many Libyans drive to the border and
purchase goods such as clothing, batteries and American brand
cigarettes and return to their cities to sell the goods on
streetside stands or in the alleys of souks, or markets.
   About a year ago, Tripoli's souk near Green Square was virtually
deserted, with the few goods for sale attracting few shoppers. The
souk now is elbow to elbow with Libyans buying clothes, tapes of
such pop artists as Madonna and Sting and jewelry and watches.
   Speaking about government, Gadhafi advised the committees to
``make the people govern themselves ... because it is in their
interst.''
   Gadhafi also praised Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, saying
he was the only man in the communist-Marxist movement ``who has the
courage to lead the movement in this risky turn of Marxist
history.''
   In the French text of his speech, Gadhafi conceded that
``certain negative aspects, and even some mistakes'' had been
connected with his revolution. But he said they were part of the
``necessary process of a sad period requiring the elimination of
all obstacles to the power of the people.''
   He also said Libya needs to move a quarter of a million families
from tents and slums to modern housing.
   ``A handful of people build palaces and millions of others live
in slums,'' he was quoted as saying. ``As a result, the revolution
has to remedy this situation.''

   A fund-raising idea to help repair a
50-year-old fountain generated a cascade of coins totalling nearly
$19,000.
   About 5,000 people lined up Sunday to place coins, mainly
quarters, on masking tape laid by volunteers for 11 blocks along
Box Butte Avenue to the fountain.
   On Monday, Eva Knight said the official total for the Coins for
the Fountain drive was $18,911.83, but said additional pledges
would help fund-raisers to exceed their $20,000 goal.
   Now, said City Parks Superintendent Lyle Shaughnessy, the next
step is to get estimates for the work. Mrs. Knight is already
planning the fountain's lighting ceremony for next May.

   In the comics, Superman may leap tall

   Wooten, 40, pulled a 14-ton mobile home atop a flatbed truck
about 100 yards across the Rhode Island-Massachusetts border Monday.
   The feat took about one minute. When it was done, a red-faced
Wooten said, ``It was a little easier than I thought. I think I

   Wooten, 6-foot-1 and 274 pounds, said he considers himself to be

<HEAD>U.S. Accuses Soviets of Violating U.N. Accords on Afghanistan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States accused the Soviet Union on
Tuesday of violating its Afghanistan pullout agreement by using
Soviet-based airplanes in bombings against U.S.-backed guerrillas.
   The United States is also concerned about the redeployment of
Soviet units in support of Afghan government forces fighting for
control of the northern city of Kanduz, said State Department
spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley.
   The Soviets, who withdrew their forces from Kunduz in recent
weeks, returned with artillery and troops to bolster the government
forces, she said.
   The Soviet troops initially were withdrawn from Kunduz, about 30
miles from the Soviet border, as part of a 50-percent reduction of
the Soviet presence, in compliance with the Geneva accords.
   The agreement, signed last April by the United Nations, Pakistan
and Afghanistan and co-guaranteed by both superpowers, calls for a
total Soviet pullout by Feb. 15, 1989.
   The Soviets appear to be using airplanes based inside the Soviet
Union to carry out the aerial bombardments around Kunduz in support
of the ground forces, Mrs. Oakley said.
   ``In our view, the use of the Soviet aircraft coming from inside
the Soviet Union are a violation of the Geneva Accords,'' she said.
The redeployment of Soviet troops from other parts of Afghanistan
to Kunduz is not viewed as violation, Mrs. Oakley added.
   The pact which brings about an end to more than eight years of
Soviet occupation is not in any danger of unraveling, she said.
``We fully expect the Soviet Union to adhere to the Geneva
accords,'' she said.
   The United States has ``raised the issue of Soviet compliance''
with the U.N. Good Offices Mission which monitors the Geneva
agreement. The Soviets, for their part, have complained to the U.N.
body about Pakistan's continued arming of the U.S.-backed
Mujahedeen guerrillas.
   The United States has said it will continue supplying Pakistan
with weapons for the Mujahedeen as long as the Soviets continue
arming the Kabul government.
   The battle for Kunduz is viewed as a test of the Kabul
goverment's ability to overcome the Mujahedeen once the Soviet
pullout is completed. Some analysts believe the government will
fall without its Soviet backers and the seven major Mujahedeen
groups will vie for control of the country among themselves.
   Despite claims by the Kabul government that it has wrested
control of Kunduz from the Mujahedeen, the authorities have refused
requests by Western reporters to visit the city, Mrs. Oakley said.
   The government is flying five planeloads of food and ammunition
into Kunduz daily to resupply its troops in the continuous
fighting, she added.
   The Soviets are using artillery to back the government troops
rather than committing any infantry to the battle, Mrs. Oakley said.
   The Soviet involvement in Kunduz will likely be raised next week
in Moscow at a meeting between Undersecretary of State Michael
Armacost and Deputy Soviet Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov.
   Mrs. Oakley said the two men would meet Sept. 1 and 2 for their
third discussion of regional issues in the past 18 months. Other
areas on the agenda are the Persian Gulf, the Middle East, Cambodia
and Southern Africa, she said.

   There was no agreement to immediately end the strikes, a
Solidarity spokesman said.
   Senior Solidarity adviser Tadeusz Mazowiecki called the decision
to hold talks ``a historic moment.''
   Walesa, who had earlier in the evening left the Lenin shipyard
to confer with top advisers and Roman Catholic Biship Tadeusz
Goclowski at St. Brygida's church, later left the rectory with
Goclowski to the cheers and chants of supporters.
   ``For the present, the strike is still on,'' said aide Piotr

   He said Walesa would be participating in the talks as president
of the Independent Self-governing Trade Union Solidarity.

<HEAD>Bennett's Farewell Report: Elementary Schools Lack Good Curricula</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William J. Bennett, in his final report as
education secretary, said Tuesday that American elementary school
pupils need stronger doses of math, science and literary classics,
as well as foreign languages starting in the fourth grade.
   Students are willing and teachers are ``for the most part good
and capable,'' Bennett said, but too many schools suffer from
defective curricula.
   At a news conference, he released a 61-page report, ``James
Madison Elementary School: A Curriculum for American Students,''
summarizing his views of what should be taught to the 32 million
youngsters enrolled in kindergarten through the eighth grade in
81,000 elementary and junior high schools.
   The report is a sequel to a model high school guide entitled
``James Madison High School,'' which Bennett wrote last year. He
quipped that the latest report might be called ``Little Jimmy
Madison Elementary School.''
   Bennett said he still believes, as he concluded in a 1986
report, that elementary schools are ``in pretty good shape'' and
``face fewer and less severe problems than now plague our high
schools.''
   By some measures, he said, achievement in the elementary grades
stands ``at its highest level in three decades.''
   But American youngsters still have an ``insufficient grasp of
basic school subjects, and they lag well behind their foreign
counterparts,'' he said.
   Bennett said the culprits include:
   _Dull texts that make reading a chore instead of a joy.
   _``Dismal'' social studies courses that start teaching children
about self-development when they are more interested in dinosaurs
and space.
   _Math courses that rely on drone-like, repetitive work books.
   Bennett has no authority to require any school to adopt his
ideas. By law, his department is barred from attempting to impose
any curriculum on state and local school officials.
   ``I wish I had gone to James Madison Elementary School,'' said
Samuel G. Sava, executive director of the National Association of
Elementary School Principals.
   To meet such a rich curriculum standard, Sava said, schools need
better textbooks, better prepared teachers and more authority to
manage their own affairs.
   Bennett said his model is ``a statement of goals,'' not ``a
monolithic program to be uniformly imposed or slavishly followed.''
   He laid down a broad outline of topics to be covered in seven
subjects: English, social studies, mathematics, science, foreign
language, fine arts and physical and health education.
   His reading lists range from the tales of Pippi Longstocking and
Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle for the early grades to ``The Red Badge of
Courage,'' ``Kon-Tiki'' and ``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland''
for older pupils.
   ``Maybe a third of our schools are doing this or approaching
this,'' Bennett said, but even some of those schools don't offer an
enriched curriculum to all their pupils.
   ``If there's a crucial point here, it's the fourth grade,'' he
said. ``We see a fourth-grade slump in reading ... math and
science.''
   He said less than two-thirds of each school day is spent on
academics. Even accounting for lunch and recess, he said,
``something like 20 percent can't be accounted for at all.''
   Bennett, who is leaving his Cabinet post on Sept. 20, said his
suggestions include American history in each of the first five
grades, world history and geography in sixth and seventh grades,
and world geography and American government in eighth grade.
   He would have all youngsters take either algebra or pre-algebra
by eighth grade, biology in seventh grade and some chemistry and
physics in eighth grade. Foreign language instruction should start
no later than fourth grade, he said.
   The report profiles seven schools as models of strong elementary
curricula. They are Meridith Magnet Elementary School in Temple,
Texas; Miller Junior High School in West San Jose, Calif.; Blaine
Elementary School in Blaine, Wash.; School No. 59, Science Magnet,
in Buffalo, N.Y.; LaSalle Language Academy in Chicago; St. Patrick
School in Miami Beach, Fla., and Maryette Elementary School in
Stilwell, Okla.
   Bennett said he will Miller Junior High in California on
Wednesday. Then he said he will speak Thursday on behalf of the
Bush campaign at San Francisco, where Democratic nominee Michael
Dukakis is expected to discuss education.
   ``I want to bring a little sunlight to that discussion,''
Bennett said.
   Copies of ``James Madison Elementary School'' can be purchased
for $2.50 each from the U.S. Government Printing Office,
Washington, D.C. 20402.

   Talks between the government and
Solidarity on solving Poland's problems can begin as soon as Lech
Walesa calls off a strike at the Lenin shipyard, a government
spokesman said today.
   In Gdansk, senior Solidarity adviser Adam Michnik said Walesa
would hold talks Wednesday with Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw
Kiszczak and a representative of the Roman Catholic church. Other
aides said there had been no immediate agreement to end the strikes
that have swept Poland for two weeks.
   ``The stoppage of strikes by Mr. Lech Walesa and the shipyard
where he works would mean automatically convening a round table,''
chief government spokesman Jerzy Urban told reporters earlier in
the day.
   Urban said there were no preconditions on what subjects could be
discussed, adding: ``The starting of talks will be a common
victory.''
   Kiszczak would mediate the round-table talks, Urban said. He
declined to elaborate on other possible participants, but hinted
the head of the official OPZZ union would be included.
   Wednesday is the eighth anniversary of accords signed in Gdansk
guaranteeing the right to free trade unions. Solidarity, once the
only independent trade federation in the Soviet bloc, was outlawed
following the imposition of martial law in 1981.
   If the talks do take place, they would be the first direct
contact between Walesa and high government officials since he was
interned after the martial law crackdown that crushed Solidarity.
   Round-table talks were proposed first Friday by Kiszczak, who
said there would be no pre-conditions although he indicated the
strikes must first end.
   Aides earlier quoted Walesa, a founder of Solidarity, as saying
he would not call for an end to the strikes without pledges that
talks involve the issue of union pluralism. He also was quoted as
saying he should take part as recognized chairman of Solidarity.
   Ten enterprises remained idled by work stoppages in Poland's
most serious wave of strikes since 1981. The work stoppages began
Aug. 16.
   About 5,000 workers joined an occupation strike at a major
southeastern steel mill on Monday after authorities attempted to
reopen it, and talks between striking workers and management broke
off at a coal mine and in the Baltic port of Szczecin.
   During the peak of the unrest, about 20 enterprises employing
100,000 workers were idled.
   The week-old strike at the defense-related Stalowa Wola mill in
southeastern Poland swelled dramatically Monday when managers tried
to reopen the 18,000-worker plant, strikers and authorities said.
   ``Strikers control a substantial part of the complex's
territory,'' state radio said of the strike. ``They control roads
inside the plant. They check IDs of passing people who are not on
strike.''
   Piotr Niemczyk, a spokesman for the Solidarity information
center in Warsaw, said the strikers demanded Walesa negotiate on
their behalf.
   Talks broke down at the July Manifesto coal mine, where the
series of strikes began, after management refused to allow workers
to speak to Walesa by telephone, according to Solidarity activist
Lech Bosiak.
   July Manifesto is in Jastrzebie, near the Czechoslovak border,
and is the last of 12 coal mines still on strike. Its strike
committee was ``waiting for Lech Walesa's talks at the famous round
table,'' Bosiak said.
   Jerzy Majka, a Communist Party spokesman, on Sunday called
Walesa a ``possible participant'' in round-table national
reconciliation talks.
   But he said Walesa could not be participate as the head of an
illegal organization.
   In a statement spirited out of the strikebound Lenin shipyard in
the Baltic port of Gdansk, Walesa said he was ready to participate
in talks but ``there must be compromise on both sides.''
   ``I do not want to participate as a private individual. ... I
stand behind Solidarity,'' he said, adding that the talks must take
up the issue of trade union pluralism.
   The mediator between Walesa and the government, Andrzej
Stelmachowski, a law professor and head of the Warsaw branch of the
Catholic Intellectuals Club, said it remained unclear whether the
talks, endorsed by Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, would
come about.
   ``The workers must decide if they wish to start the talks or
not, because the government insists the strikes must end before the
talks around the round table begin,'' Stelmachowski said.
   ``The workers are hesitant, because of the risk, which is
enormous,'' he said.
   Stelmachowski said that although he felt there was good will on
both sides, ``mistrust is so great ... that it is very difficult to
put them together.''
   He said there was no deadline for agreeing to talks, but some of
the strikes were connected with military products and the
government would not tolerate such stoppages indefinitely.
   Air Force Col. Mieczyslaw Laskowski, interviewed by state
television, noted that Stalowa Wola is a defense industry plant
serving Poland and its socialist allies, and said no country in the
world allowed strikes at such facilities.
   ``The situation cannot tolerated ad infinitum,'' he said.

   ``The War of the Worlds,'' the story of a
deadly invasion by Martians that terrified believing radio
listeners 50 years ago, has been refought amid the serene hills of
filmmaker George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch.
   The drama is coming back to national radio, but set in the
present.
   On Sunday, Halloween Eve 1938, a startled nation listening to
Orson Welles' Mercury Theater on CBS radio heard what many assumed
was live coverage of an invasion by monster aliens and their
indestructible engines of war.
   Welles eventually announced that the broadcast, based on a
science fiction story by H.G. Wells, was a Halloween prank, but
CBS' switchboards were swamped, and rumors of slimy, stalking death
terrorized people who believed it was happening.
   ``Fake Radio War Stirs Terror Through U.S.'' cried a huge lead
headline in New York's Daily News.
   Like the original, this 60-minute anniversary production will be
presented nationally on Sunday, Oct. 30, on National Public Radio.
   ``We'll have disclaimers'' before the broadcast, said director
David Ossman.
   ``Of the creatures in the rocket cylinder I can give you no
authoritative information,'' boomed the voice of Welles in the role
of astronomy Professor Richard Pierson, theorizing about what
killed 40 people in the opening assault at the town of Grovers
Mill, N.J.
   In the current production, set in the present, these same words
are spoken to a clamoring news conference by actor Jason Robards,
playing Pierson.
   The cast also includes entertainer Steve Allen playing a network
newsman broadcasting ``to the last'' and retired CBS newsman
Douglas Edwards commenting on the ``end of civilization.''
   Real newapaper and television reporters who covered the
production last weekend also wound up in the cast, playing
reporters covering their ``last'' news story.
   While the original thriller was done with sound effects in a
studio, the update is hi-tech, state-of-the-art.
   Half the production was recorded outdoors to get natural
background sounds at the Lucas ranch in the summer-brown hills of
Marin County, about 40 miles north of San Francisco.
   And unlike most radio drama, in which actors simply stand at
microphones, the actors in this new production moved around as they
would for film. The man behind this technique is sound designer
Randy Thom, who won an Oscar for his work in ``The Right Stuff.''
   But even without such techniques, the original broadcast was so
realistic that some people contemplated suicide rather than die at
the hands of the terrifying creatures. Others ran weeping through
the streets and panicked callers clogged telephone lines to public
safety offices.
   In the story, the Martians finally succumb, not to man's weapons
of war but to germs.
   ``Later, when their bodies were examined in laboratories, it was
found that they were killed by the putrefactive and disease
bacteria against which their systems were unprepared ... slain,
after all man's defenses had failed, by the humblest thing that God
in his wisdom put upon this earth,'' the original script read.
   John Houseman, who co-produced the Welles show, has told of
phones jangling off the wall in his control room ``and a shrill
voice through the receiver announcing itself as the mayor of a
(unnamed) `big Midwestern city.'''
   Houseman went on, ``choking with fury, he reported mobs in the
streets of the city, women and children huddled in church, violence
and looting ...''
   The new production is funded by $100,000 in grants from the
National Endowment for the Arts and the McGavern Guild Radio.

<HEAD>Judge Blocks HUD Sale Of Foreclosed Homes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge temporarily blocked the
Department of Housing and Urban Development on Tuesday from selling
foreclosed single-homes across the nation to the highest bidder.
   U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene said his temporary
restraining order would remain in effect until Sept. 14 while Judge
Oliver Gasch, who has jurisdiction over the case, schedules further
deliberation.
   Greene said, ``Clearly, HUD did not comply with (housing
laws).'' He said challengers of the sales would ``likely be
successful on the merits.''
   He said his order would apply nationwide, but would not affect
HUD sales previously entered into with buyers.
   The suit was brought by a coalition of advocates for the
homeless as part of a broader effort to force the federal
government to make the federal government's inventory of 47,000
foreclosed houses available to the homeless.
   Florence Wagman Roisman, representing the National Housing Law
Project, said the restraining order was sought because HUD planned
to sign contracts to sell 170 homes in the Washington, D. C.,
metropolitan area on Wednesday. Last week, the project blocked HUD
from selling 200 homes in Michigan.
   Greene accepted the project's arguments that HUD had violated
the Homeless Assistance Act of 1987, requiring HUD to survey all
federal buildings and properties to ``identify which ... are
suitable to assist the homeless.''
   The project also said the legislation stipulates that HUD must
then make properties in excess of the agency's need available to
the homeless.
   Greene said HUD also violated the National Housing Act, which
calls for ``the realization as soon as feasible of the goal of a
decent home and a suitable living environment for every American
family.''
   ``We don't want HUD to sell off these units to speculators and
investors,'' said Roisman. ``They have 47,000 units available. Even
if they had 80,000, it would be a drop in the bucket. There are
800,000 families on a waiting list for housing around the country.''
   W. Robert Irwin, a Justice Department attorney representing HUD,
said there is no need for the court to block any house auctions.
``There is a continuing recycling of houses into and out of the HUD
inventory,'' he said.
   Under the restraining order, Irwin said, ``The houses will
remain vacant. They will be the subject of vandalism and there will
be a loss of property values, depending on the length of the suit.''
   Roisman said the houses do not have to remain vacant because, in
just the Washington area, there are 700 families with 2,500
children living in hotels and motels. ``They would be very happy to
move into a home,'' she said.

   The Pentagon said today six
Americans were among those killed when three Italian jets collided
at an air show, one hurtling into the crowd in flames.
   Two days after Sunday's disaster at the U.S. Air Base in
Ramstein, there were conflicting reports on the total number of
dead. Late today, West German officials increased the death toll to
49, saying two of the injured died during the day. But the Pentagon
said 40 deaths were confirmed.
   West German authorities said they have identified 14 of the
dead. Many victims were burned beyond recognition in the accident,
the world's worst air show crash involving spectators.
   In Washington, chief Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said the
latest count put the number of confirmed fatalities at 40,
including six Americans, four Germans, three Italians and 27 people
of unknown nationality.
   Of the six Americans, two were active-duty military personnel,
three were dependents and one is unknown, Howard said.
   He said the Defense Department was trying to resolve conflicts
in the casualty counts. The latest Pentagon count also shows 363
individuals injured, of whom 41 were American and 322 German, the
spokesman said.
   Juergen Dietzen, spokesman for the Rhineland Palatinate state
where Ramstein is located, said many people suffered
``life-threatening injuries.''
   Also today, the U.S. Air Force issued a statment saying four
injured Americans were being flown to the United States. The names
of the four were not made public.
   Brigitte De Jesus, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Army hospital in
Landstuhl, said the Americans would be transported to Brooke Army
Medical in San Antonio, Texas, on a medical evacuation flight.
   U.S. military burn specialists from the medical center in Texas
examined 12 seriously burned Americans, including several children,
at the hospital in Landstuhl.
   West Germany's ARD television said about 50 people were in
critical condition.
   A memorial service for the victims will be held Saturday in
Ramstein, Hans-Juergen Vollmer, spokesman for the Kaiserslautern
district government, said today.
   On Monday, the government banned acrobatic performances by West
Germany warplanes and called for the suspension of all military air
shows in the country. In addition, U.S. Ambassador Richard Burt
indicated the United States might ban stunt-flying exhibitions at
air shows at its bases in West Germany.
   West Germany and its NATO partners suspended military air shows
in this nation Monday ``until suggestions for effective measures
are complete,'' said Defense Minister Rupert Scholz.
   Scholz also said he was permanently barring military
stunt-flying exhibitions by West German military aircraft at air
shows.
   ``I have made the decision that aerobatic flying can no longer
be considered,'' he told the ZDF television network Monday night.
``But it is obvious that I can make this decision only for the West
German armed forces.''
   Interviewed during the same program, Burt indicated a similar
U.S. action.
   ``We are very open-minded about whether there will be future
aerobatic shows,'' Burt said. ``The United States will do all it
can to make sure such a tragedy never happens again.''
   Meanwhile, John Galvin, commanding general of NATO, visited the
crash site on Monday.
   ``We have absolutely no idea what went wrong,'' he said.
   Sunday's accident occurred as two formations of stunt-flying
jets passed each other in a complicated maneuver about 180 feet
above the airfield as about 300,000 people looked on.
   A solo jet coming from another direction was supposed to zoom by
the two groups of planes as they passed at parallel levels, making
it appear as if all three flight paths intersected.
   Instead, the solo jet collided with two of other nine planes.
One plunged into a forest, another onto the runway. The solo jet
hurtled into a crowd of thousands of people and exploded into a
ball of flames.
   In Rome, the Italian air force chief said the stunt team
involved in the disaster will eliminate manuevers that fly over
people and reduce the number of planes at other performances this
year.
   Gen. Franco Pisano ordered an investigation into the disaster
involving the Tri-Color Arrows team.

   The body of a woman apparently beaten to
death was under a motel bed for several days while customers used
the room, police said Tuesday.
   On Sunday, a guest refused to use the room because of a smell.
The body was discovered by a maintenance man on Monday.
   Nassau County police Detective Sgt. John Nolan said the woman
apparently was under the bed in Room 33 of the Oceanside Motel for
several days.
   A toxicology report due in a couple of weeks would determine how
long the woman had been dead, he said.
   The motel's assistant manager, Gary Robinson, said he checked
the room Sunday _ but did not look in the enclosed space beneath
the platform-type bed _ after a Saturday night customer complained
of a smell. He said he didn't find anything but left the door open
to air out the room.
   Police said they had not identified the dead woman.

<HEAD>Parliament Passes Tough Law on Journalists Who Write Defamatory
Stories</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NILOVA ROY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament on Tuesday enacted
legislation that could mean prison sentences of up to five years
for journalists who write defamatory articles.
   Opposition leaders said the bill was motivated by a government
dogged by corruption scandals.
   The Defamation Bill 1988, piloted by the federal government, was
passed by a voice vote amid strong resistance from opposition
political parties, Indian news agencies said.
   Members from opposition parties walked out to protest the bill
they called ``draconian,'' and designed to ``muzzle the press,''
according to the Press Trust of India news agency. A walkout is the
strongest form of protest available in parliamentary procedure.
   The news agency said they objected to a clause that says,
``Where any matter which is grossly indecent or scurrilous or is
intended for blackmail, is published in any newspaper, periodical
or circular, the author of such matter and the printer, publisher
and editor of such newspaper, periodical or circular shall be
punishable with imprisonment for a term ... which may extend to
five years.''
   Opposition parliamentarians resisted the bill because it seeks
to cover any imputation of criminal offence against an individual
as aggravated defamation, PTI and the United News of India said.
   Janata Party leader Madhu Dandavate said the government wanted
the bill passed to protect itself from the scandals that have
surfaced since 1987.
   Most allege that kickbacks from various defence purchases have
been accepted by top government officers and officials of Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress party.
   Dandavate said the bill was motivated by a government ``under
the shadow of scandals.''
   P. Chidambaram, the minister of State for Home Affairs who
introduced the bill Monday, denied the charge.
   He said the government did not intend to curb the press, but
intended to ensure that a person's privacy and honor were not
destroyed.
   ``I will defend until my death the right of newspapers to
publish what is truth,'' he said. ``But the right must be to
publish only the truth. Investigations by journalists must lead to
facts and not to insinuations and innuendos.''

   A federal judge on Tuesday refused to allow The
Washington Post access to search warrants and other court documents
used in the search of three homes in the government's Pentagon
bribery investgation.
   U.S. District Chief Judge Alexander Harvey reversed a U.S.
magistrate who had decided in July to unseal some of the documents,
but not others.
   ``It is apparent to this court that unsealing the search
warrants and inventories would reveal much of the information in
the applications and affidavits,'' Harvey said.
   The judge also said the three Maryland men whose homes were
searched were merely under investigation, not criminally charged,
and thus had a right to privacy.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Aronica had argued that
information in the documents, if made public, could interfere with
the continuing inquiry by government investigators and a grand jury
in Virginia.
   But Barbara Percival, attorney for the Post, said information in
the warrants could have been passed on by the people whose homes
were searched, since they had had the papers for two months.
   The documents pertain to the government's investigation of a
senior Air Force procurement officer and two private consultants.
   The newspaper challenged the sealing of the documents by U.S.
Magistrate James Kenkel, who then directed them to be made public
July 18 but gave the government 10 days to appeal the decision.
   At the same time, Kenkel said the more sensitive affidavits used
to support the request for the warrants could remain secret for 45
more days, a period that ends Thursday. Aronica said during
Tuesday's hearing that his office would ask Kenkel to extend the
sealing of those documents.
   In his ruling, Harvey said Kenkel was wrong to decide the search
warrants and inventories of what was seized at the three homes
should be unsealed, but that applications for the warrants and
affidavits supporting them should not.
   Harvey, noting that there was no disagreement that the
information should eventually be made public, said the real dispute
was over timing. He said all the documents should stay sealed the
same amount of time.

Tomb Scene</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Inch by inch, with the help of expert riggers,
the funeral boat of one of ancient Egypt's most powerful pharoahs
took another journey Tuesday, to a new $2.2 million museum exhibit.
   Hydraulic jacks, dollies and a forklift were used to move the
fragile, 3,847-year-old wooden boat about 50 yards from a display
section of the Field Museum of Natural History to an exhibit
designed to recreate a pharoah's tomb.
   ``It went very well,'' said Suzanne Santos, a museum spokeswoman.
   Before the move, the 32-foot boat _ a graceful craft resembling
a canoe _ was gently lifted off the floor and rotated so it was
pointing south to its new destination, Mrs. Santos said.
   Riggers who performed the tricky maneuver had to keep their
hands off, so no sweat or body oils would harm the ancient wood.
   The boat, used in the funeral of King Sen-wosret III in about
1850 B.C., now becomes part of a new permanent exhibit called
``Inside Ancient Egypt,'' which opens in November.
   The actual moving of the boat took about an hour, Mrs. Santos
said.
   The ancient craft has been at the museum since 1900, and for at
least a dozen years has been encased in glass in a room with other
Egyptian artifacts.
   ``It was your typical museum collection,'' Mrs. Santos said.
   The new exhibit will give visitors a feel for ancient Egypt,
though glass will still prevent any direct contact with the boat,
she said.
   The exhibit will give visitors their only opportunity outside
Egypt to enter and explore a life-size tomb complex, with two
burial chambers, mummies and a shrine to the cat goddess Bastet,
the museum said.
   King Sen-wosret's boat is among more than 1,000 artifacts to be
displayed.
   Visitors will enter the tomb chambers of Unis-ankh, son of the
5th Dynasty pharaoh Unis. The chambers date to 2400 B.C. and were
excavated at Saqqara, Egypt, in 1908.
   Beneath a false door, a 35-foot burial shaft will take visitors
into the dark burial chamber itself. The sarcophagus is empty. When
the tomb was excavated, the mummy was gone, probably stolen by tomb
robbers.
   Leaving the burial chamber, visitors will pass through a roughly
hewn tomb robbers' tunnel and into a series of Egyptian burial
scenes featuring dioramas, 23 mummies and other artifacts.
   ``It gives (visitors) a chance to explore the age-old mysteries
of mummies and life after death,'' said the exhibit's developer,
Janet Kamien.
   Sen-wosret's boat was one of four excavated in 1894 from his
tomb at Dashur by Jacques DeMorgan, a Welsh Egyptologist, the
museum said. Two are at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and the other
is at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh.
   No one knows if Sen-wosret's boats were used to transport his
body across the Nile to the burial site, or if they was buried near
the tomb for use in the afterlife by the king's soul, said Frank
Yurco, a scholar on ancient Egypt at the Oriental Institute and a
consultant on the museum project.
   Sen-wosret conducted military campaigns that extended Egypt's
boundary into the Nubian region of Ethiopia and the Sudan, as well
as securing control of the Nile River to the south, he said. He
also centralized the government, setting the pattern for several
hundred years.
   Sen-wosret is believed to have died when he was about 50, Yurco
said.

   In the neighborhood where 82 people died
two years ago after the collision of a jetliner and a small plane,
few signs of the disaster remain.
   ``I'm surprised what another year has done. I think the
neighborhood is fine now,'' said Sue Nelson, who once wanted to
erect a plaque inmemory of those who died in the collision between
an Aeromexico DC-9 and a light plane.
   At dawn Tuesday, homeowners watered carefully cut and edged
lawns, cats scrapped in the street, a deliveryman plopped
newspapers onto driveways and an occasional runner passed.
   ``It's been two years? If you didn't tell me, I wouldn't have
remembered. I never think about. I don't even remember that day,''
said Gladys Rubio, 47, as she completed her morning jog where
wreckage once burned.
   On Aug. 31, 1986, a Piper Archer with three people aboard
collided in flight with the Aeromexico DC-9 carrying 64 people. The
jetliner plunged into the neighborhood, exploded and killed another
15 people on the ground.
   Sixteen houses burned, 10 of them destroyed by flames or falling
wreckage. There was nearly $3 million in damage.
   The Piper fell in front of a church. The jet fell and exploded,
sending bodies and flaming debris raining to the ground as it cut a
swath through the tidy suburb 30 miles southeast of Los Angeles.
   Now, there are only hints that tragedy once visited: A
weed-infested lot on Holmes Avenue where a house once stood, three
80-foot pines with fire-scorched trunks, several new, oversized
homes.
   Where the smoldering airliner finally stopped, incinerating a
modest $150,000 home, a five-bedroom, three-bathroom Spanish-style
house is being sold for $485,000. Average home prices have nearly
doubled since the crash.
   A new house alongside the Nelsons, whose home was clipped by the
jetliner and set ablaze, was rented to a couple for $1,400 a month
on the eve of the crash.
   ``We told people who looked at it that three people died here
when the plane crashed,'' said Tom Samuelson, who manages the
property. ``We feel that if someone has any apprehension we didn't
want a tenant for a few weeks and have them vacate.''
   ``Another year is all it took to get back with our lives and
forget all about it,'' said Mrs. Nelson, adding she has given up
the idea of a neighborhood memorial plaque to honor the dead. ``We
are forgetting.''
   The memories were rekindled this week, however, by televised
coverage of Sunday's air show crash at a U.S. air base in West
Germany.
   ``The air show in West Germany had a big impact on us. It
brought memories back. As a matter of fact, I dreamed a plane
crashed last night,'' she said. ``The wounds have healed for the
most part. I'm surprised about that.''
   But her son Robbie, 9, still won't get in an airplane.
   ``We went on another driving trip this year,'' Mrs. Nelson said.
``I just have to get him on a plane so we can really get away.''
   The sound of jetliners flying overhead doesn't seem to bother
anyone anymore. ``I don't even think about it,'' said Mrs. Rubio.
   Gone are the sightseers who cruised the neighborhood for a year
afterward, averaging six carloads an hour on some weekends.
   ``For about the first year people came by a lot and it was
annoying, but the sightseers don't show up anymore,'' said Pete
Armenta, owner of a local barber shop. ``The customers bring it up
once in a while, but everybody's pretty much gotten over it.''
   A year ago, too, local ministers arranged a memorial service to
remember the dead. There will be no service this year.
   ``The local clergy didn't plan anything this year. They are
trying to put it behind them,'' said Michelle Ogle, spokeswoman for
the city of Cerritos. ``I would say it is typical of the majority
of the community to forget. But I'm sure those people in the
neighborhood will never forget.''

   An 18-year-old mother of three ordered to
practice birth control throughout her child-bearing years is
pregnant again, but the judge who sentenced her for child abuse
says she won't revoke the probation.
   ``I have not been presented evidence that she is not in
compliance with the court order,'' Maricopa County Superior Court
Judge Lindsay Budzyn said during a hearing Monday. She noted that
no method of birth control was foolproof.
   ``Pregnancy doesn't necessarily constitute a violation,'' Ms.
Budzyn said.
   The judge sentenced Debra Ann Forster to lifetime probation last
May 24 with the birth-control stipulation. The judge, who could
have imposed a 30-year jail term, said it was the only way to make
sure Mrs. Forster did not have other children to abuse.
   Mrs. Forster, who has appealed the sentence, pleaded guilty in
April to two counts of attempted child abuse stemming from a May
1987 incident in which she left her sons, William, 1{, and Scott, 6
months, alone in a Mesa apartment for three days. Authorities said
the apartment had no air conditioning, and both babies were
dehydrated and near death when found.
   The birth-control order attracted protests from such disparate
groups as the Roman Catholic Church, which proscribes birth
control, and the American Civil Liberties Union.
   Ms. Budzyn said Monday she would not order Mrs. Forster to have
an abortion nor issue any abortion ruling.
   She also said she would rule by Friday on motions from Garrett
Simpson, Mrs. Forster's public defender, and the ACLU to modify the
terms of probation and delete the birth-control requirement.
   The ACLU attorney, Colin Campbell, argued that the order was
invasive, amounted to cruel and unusual punishment and violated
freedom of religion for Mrs. Forster, a Catholic.
   Jeff Sandler, a deputy county attorney, countered that the
sentence served useful purposes in rehabilitating the defendant and
protecting others.
   The judge learned in court of the new pregnancy _ Mrs. Forster's
fourth _ from Simpson, who said it was confirmed last week. The
baby is due April 23, he said.
   He refused to say whether Mrs. Forster was practicing birth
control when she became pregnant.
   While awaiting trial this year, Mrs. Forster gave up the rights
to her sons and a daughter, who was born in jail. According to
court records, all three have been adopted.

   The death toll in the worst crash
at an air show rose to 49 Tuesday, and officials feared some
children hospitalized with severe burns had been orphaned because
no one had inquired about them.
   The Pentagon said six Americans were among those killed when
three Italian jets collided Sunday at the U.S. Air Base in
Ramstein, one hurtling into the crowd in flames.
   West German officials said two people died of burns Tuesday,
raising their death toll to 49. They said 14 had been identified,
including the three Italian pilots. None of the 14 was a U.S.
citizen.
   Chief Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said the latest U.S. count
put the number of confirmed fatalities at 40, including six
Americans, four Germans, three Italians and 27 people of unknown
nationality. Of the six Americans, two were active-duty military
personnel, three were dependents and one is unknown, Howard said.
   The Defense Department was trying to resolve its conflicts in
the casualty counts, he said.
   The latest Pentagon count also showed 363 individuals injured,
of whom 41 were Americans and 322 were Germans, Howard said.
   Four U.S. burn victims were flown to the Brooke Army Medical
Center in San Antonio, Texas, for further treatment. Surgeons and
other medical staff took nearly an hour to move the blanket-covered
patients from a military ambulance onto a C-141 U.S. Air Force
transport plane.
   As the four were being loaded onto the transport, a fighter jet
screamed overhead.
   The decision to move them from the Landstuhl hospital was made
after the San Antonio team headed by two surgeons examined them
Monday and Tuesday.
   The West German Bild and Abendpost newspapers said at least
three children had been hospitalized with serious burns but no one
had inquired about them, leading to speculation their parents had
been killed in the accident.
   In Udine, Italy, the commander of the Italian stunt-flying team
said that the team's soloist, Lt. Col. Ivo Nutarelli, had caused
the crash when he reached the point were the jets intersected too
soon and too low.
   Lt. Col. Diego Raineri, who was coordinating the team's
movements from a control tower when the collision occurred, spoke
to reporters shortly before the remains of the three pilots killed
in the crash arrived home. About 2,000 people were at the airport
when the bodies arrived.
   Some Italian politicans called for a parliamentary investigation
of the crash and for the resignation of the defense minister and
the Air Force commander.
   In downtown Ramstein, about 100 members of the leftist Greens
Party and their supporters took part in a vigil Tuesday evening.
They expressed shock over the accident and called for a permanent
ban on military air shows.
   ``The mood here has changed. Now they see the danger is a
reality ... it has happened,'' said Gabrielle Schellanner, a local
party spokeswoman. ``Before, when we warned about it, people didn't
take it seriously _ they thought it was just a political thing.''
   Authorities said they were being deluged with pleas from people
seeking information on family members.
   Juergen Dietzen, spokesman for the Rhineland Palatinate state
government, said police had received more than 400 reports of
missing people following Sunday's disaster. He said some people
were listed in more than one report.
   ``There are even cases of people from as far away as America who
have said `My relative has been on vacation there for three weeks,
and we haven't heard a word. Is it possible they were at
Ramstein?''' said Dietzen.
   West Germany's ARD television showed pictures of a special
missing persons bureau set up after the disaster in the town of
Kaiserslautern near Ramstein.
   ``I'm looking for my sister,'' said a German man whose name was
not given. ``The whole family didn't come home.'
   Officials said that of the 282 people still hospitalized, about
20 to 30 were so badly burned and disfigured that they also were in
danger of dying.
   The Bild newspaper said authorities have searched in vain for
the parents of two badly burned girls _ 6-year-old Nadine and
10-year-old Melanie _ who are being treated at a hospital in
Oggersheim.
   ``Their faces and their bodies are burned _ 70 percent _ and
their hair is singed,'' the newspaper reported.
   Bild quoted head surgeon Dr. Rudolf Zellner as saying it was
possible the parents of both girls were dead since no one inquired
about them.
   One young boy thought to be about 13 with burns on 95 percent of
his body has still not been identified because he is in deep shock,
the Frankfurt Abendpost newspaper said.
   The boy has not regained consciousness since he was brought to
the Offenbach hospital near Frankfurt ``and no one has asked about
him,'' Dr. Roberto Avalos was quoted as saying, adding it was
suspected his parents were dead.

the United States on accounting for the more than 1,700 American
military personnel still missing in the Vietnam War, ending a
boycott that lasted less than a month, the State Department said
Tuesday.
   A U.S. technical team will meet with Vietnamese authorities in
Hanoi to work out details for a joint field survey and excavation
activities in Vietnam, department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said.
The meeting is tentatively set for Sept. 9-12.
   ``We welcome this resumption of cooperation and anticipate that
the joint field activities will make a major contribution in
achieving the fullest possible accounting for Americans still
missing in Vietnam,'' she said.
   She said a U.S. team also will visit Hanoi on Sept. 5-8 to
discuss a plan to allow private American organizations to treat
Vietnamese with war-related disabilities.
   On Aug. 3, Vietnam suspended cooperation with the United States
on the accounting effort. Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach said his
government was retaliating against a ``hostile policy'' the United
States was pursuing against Vietnam.
   His statement was prompted by testimony in late July in which
Assistant Secretary of State Gaston Sigur reaffirmed the
longstanding U.S. policy of maintaining diplomatic distance from
Hanoi until its troops are withdrawn from Cambodia.
   The United States has agreed to discuss humanitarian issues with
Vietnam but says there can be no trade or diplomatic relations
between the two countries until the Cambodian issue is resolved.
   Sigur said the Reagan administration was opposed to a proposal
by several members of Congress to establish a small U.S. diplomatic
mission in Hanoi.
   Mrs. Oakley said Vietnam has not agreeed to resume discussions
on resettlement in the United States of former political detainees
who were associated with the former U.S.-backed government in
Saigon.
   She expressed disappointment there will be no discussions on
that issue but said the administration hopes the two September
meetings ``will initiate a period of increased cooperation on all
humanitarian issues of mutual interest.''

   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said
Tuesday that his country would make no concessions to Iraq as peace
talks to end their 8-year-old war remained stalled for a fourth day.
   ``That is Iraq's dream ... but if they couldn't get any
concessions during this long war with so many casualties, of course
they will not be able to get any concessions or anything beyond
their legal rights during the peace talks,'' Velayati told The
Associated Press in an interview.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, who is
conducting the negotiations between Velayati and his Iraqi
counterpart Tariq Aziz, said the talks were stalled over immediate
troop withdrawal and freedom of navigation.
   ``We are trying to clear the first part (of a U.N. peace
resolution) on an immediate cease-fire and a troop withdrawal
without delay ... the cease-fire at sea is part of the problem,''
he said on arrival at the Palais des Nations.
   Formal talks have been suspended since Friday, and low-level
talks have been held without the participation of Velayati and Aziz.
   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani told an evening news briefing
that technical experts from the two delegations continued to work
at the Palais, but a top-level meeting was not planned. ``If there
is a formula, then there will be a (top level) meeting,'' he said.
   The secretary-general met Monday with the ambassadors of the
five permanent members of the Security Council _ Britain, China,
France, the Soviet Union and the United States _ to discuss how to
get the talks going again.
   In Tehran, spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini declared
Tuesday that the war with Iraq was not over yet. He accused the
United States and the Soviet Union of plotting against his country,
official Tehran radio reported.
   The radio, monitored in Nicosia, said Khomeini urged Iranians to
man the front lines but also called for a national effort in Iran's
post-war reconstruction.
   The 88-year-old religious patriarch, who said last month that
Iran's acceptance of a U.N. cease-fire resolution was ``more deadly
to me than poison,'' declared: ``We must not take it that the war
has ended.''
   ``Our enemy, be it big enemies such as America and the Soviet
Union or their surrogates such as (Iraqi President) Saddam
(Hussein) and others, are constantly plotting because they have
seen how Islam has become a major force in the world,'' Khomeini
was quoted as saying.
   Velayati blamed Iraq for blocking the peace talks. ``The main
problem is the raising of new preconditions by Iraq,'' he said.
   He said the preconditions included a demand for the immediate
clearing of the disputed Shatt-al-Arab waterway, Iraq's only outlet
to the sea, and Baghdad's unilateral abrogation of the 1975 Algiers
treaty.
   The treaty places the border between the two countries down the
middle of the waterway. Iraq demands full sovereignty over the
waterway.
   Velayati said Iraq was ``facing a lot of internal difficulties
because people ask them, why did you start this 8-year-old war, for
what reason?''
   ``We think this is the main reason they are looking for some
advantage, some concessions,'' he said.
   The Shatt-al-Arab has been blocked by sunken ships since the
outbreak of the war.
   Aziz said Monday the waterway should be cleared as soon as
possible to balance the advantage gained by Iran when Iraq stopped
attacks on Iranian shipping under the terms of an Aug. 20
cease-fire.
   Aziz also complained of Iran's continued searches of Iraqi-bound
vessels in the Persian Gulf.
   Velayati said the clearing of the Shatt-al-Arab should come ``at
an appropriate time, after all the provisions of the cease-fire
have bneen implemented.''
   ``We do not think that a deadlock has been reached,'' the
Iranian minister said. ``We do hope that the secretary-general can
find a solution for such difficulties.''
   He said he would remain in Geneva ``as long as the
secretary-general will be here and asks us to remain here.'' Aziz
made a similar declaration the previous day.

<HEAD>Out-of-Court Settlement Reached IN Jackson Video Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH SHOGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson has
reached an out-of-court settlement with a company that sold
thousands of videotapes of his address to the Democratic National
Convention, attorneys said Tuesday.
   ``Yes, there has been a settlement,'' said Eric Cohen, an
attorney for MPI Home Video. ``But I believe the terms are
confidential.''
   Jackson's attorney, Henry Mason, also refused to discuss the
agreement, and both sides refused to say whether it would allow the
sale or distribution of more MPI tapes of Jackson's speech.
   ``The parties have reached an agreement in principle,'' Mason
said. ``We hope to wrap it up in the next 10 days or so.''
   The settlement avoided a trial, which had been scheduled to
begin Tuesday, over whether MPI had the right to profit from tapes
of Jackson's July 19 speech in Atlanta.
   MPI sold about 7,500 of the videotapes, at $14.95 each, before
U.S. District Judge James B. Zagel's temporary order July 29
brought a halt to the sales, said Robert Breisblatt, another
attorney for Oak Forest-based MPI. Breisblatt said he did not know
exactly how long the videotapes had been on sale before then, but
he estimated it was less than week.
   Mason said Jackson's camp, which had gone to court to block the
sales, was pleased with the settlement.
   MPI had contended that the black leader's speech was news and
unprotected by copyright law. But Jackson argued that the
videotapes exploited his name as well as his literary and
oratorical skills.
   He testified at an earlier hearing that MPI's tape, which he did
not authorize, hurt his livelihood by limiting the marketability of
a videotape of the speech that he planned to sell.
   Zagel, in his order halting the sales, agreed.
   ``There is ... more than negligible probability that (Jackson)
earns part of his living ... on his oratory,'' the judge said.

<HEAD>American Military Inspectors Complete Review of Missile
Destruction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. inspectors ended a series of visits to Soviet
military bases under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces missile
treaty, expressing pleasure with the openness the Kremlin afforded
them, Tass reported Tuesday.
   Brig. Gen. Roland Lajoie, director of the Pentagon's On-Site
Inspection Agency, said at a Moscow news conference te reception
accorded his team exceeded his expectations, the official news
agency said.
   Lt. Col. Laurence Kelly, another team member, said 15
inspections were made since July 1. In all in the East bloc,
American inspectors were scheduled to visit 133 sites as stipulated
in the treaty signed in December by President Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The treaty requires both superpowers to eliminate their arsenals
of nuclear weapons with ranges of 300- to 3,400 miles.
   Soviet inspectors visited bases in West German, Belgium,
Britain, the Netherlands and the United States during the July
1-Aug. 29 inspection period.
   Lajoie said the inspectors looked at Soviet military facilities
to check on sites of deployment, and numbers and classes of
missiles to be destroyed, according to Tass.
   The Soviet Union has destroyed 22 medium-range and more than 50
shorter-range missiles so far under the treaty. The United States
is to destroy its first missile under the treaty on Sept. 8 at the
Longhorn Army Ammunitions plant near Marshall, Texas.

   Two Soviet MiG-29s did an impromptu
aerobatic display as they arrived in Britain on Tuesday for their
first public display in the West at an air show next week.
   Two British Tornado F3s intercepted the newest Soviet fighters
100 miles out over the North Sea and escorted them to Farnborough
in tight formation. The Tornados then peeled off to allow the
Soviets to carry out their short display before landing.
   The British and Soviet crews greeted each other on the ground
with warm smiles, handshakes, and pledges that safety would come
first at the Farnborough air show, following Sunday's fatal
accident at an exhibition at the U.S. Air Base at Ramstein in West
Germany.
   ``We consider safety to be the most important aspect of all,''
said Anatoly Kvotchur, chief test pilot with Mikoyan, the MiG-29's
makers, and the first to land in England.
   Wing Cmdr. Euan Black, 42, who welcomed the Soviet fighters to
Britain in his Tornado jet, agreed that safety was paramount.
   The Soviets have shown the MiG-29 privately in Finland but its
public debut in the West will be at Farnborough. Moscow is hoping
its twin-tailed, twin-engined fighter will impress the
international arms buyers visiting the week-long show.

<HEAD>Pilots' Bodies Return To Italy, Commander Discusses Tragedy</HEAD>

   The soloist for the Italian air force stunt
team caused the fatal crash at the West German air show when he
arrived too low and too soon at the point where the jets
intersected, his commander said Tuesday.
   Lt. Col. Diego Raineri spoke to reporters shortly before the
remains of the three pilots killed in the crash Sunday at Ramstein,
West Germany, arrived at the airport. About 2,000 people were at
the airport when the bodies arrived.
   Defense Minister Valerio Zanone will attend the funeral
Wednesday for the pilots identified as Lt. Col. Mario Naldini, 38;
the soloist, Lt. Col. Ivo Nutarelli, 41; and Capt. Giorgio Alessio,
31, who was the youngest member of the team.
   ``It is easy enough to tell what happened,'' said Ranieri, who
as commader was coordinating the team's manuevers by radio from the
ground at the time of the collision that sent one plane hurtling
into the crowd.
   ``The first section of the formation flew in one direction and
the soloist came in from 90 degrees, colliding with two planes,''
he said. Two of the three other planes in that group were damaged,
he said.
   ``I was the only one (team member) to see the tragedy, but I
don't understand what happened. The soloist came in early on the
rest of the formation and at the same altitude,'' Ranieri said.
   ``The other section, composed of four planes, did not know what
happened until the end of the manuever when the pilots saw the
wreckage and the smoke on the runway,'' he said.
   Some Italian politicans called for a parliamentary investigation
of the crash, called for the resignation of the defense minister
and the Air Force commander, and criticized the Defense Ministry's
decision to allow the team to continue its performances this year.
   ``The decision of the Defense Ministry to continue the next
exhibitions of the national aerobatic team seems like an offense in
front of the victims, the hundreds of injured at Ramstein and the
pilots that died in the accident,'' said Greens party Deputies Rosa
Filippini and Giancarlo Salvoldi.
   The two said they would demand an urgent meeting of the Chamber
of Deputies to debate the tragedy.
   Deputy Flaminio Piccoli, a member of the dominant Christian
Democrats and the president of the chamber's foreign committee,
criticized the risks ``to the lives of the exceptional pilots and
to the lives of the citizens and spectators'' and said it was
necessary for the government and Parliament to investigate the
tragedy.
   The organizers of an air show Satuday in Fribourg, Switzerland,
announced they have asked the Italian team to withdraw because of
the accident at Ramstein. They said the request was to show respect
for the dead pilots and because the crash investigation is still
underway.
   Also on Tuesday, organizers canceled a Sept. 11 air show in
Venice.
   Ranieri, during his impromptu news conference, defended the
decision to continue performances by the team this year.
   ``An experience like Ramstein cannot be erased from the memory,
but the motivation to do our work has not changed very much,'' he
said. ``The time to reconstruct the unit decimated by the accident
will be months, probably years. We were the best in the world.''

<HEAD>US, Soviets Verify Claims of Each Medium-Range Nuclear Arsenal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and the Soviet Union have
completed initial, 60-day inspections under the Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces treaty detecting any apparent discrepancies in their
claimed arsenals, defense sources said Tuesday.
   ``The numbers matched,'' said one Pentagon official, referring
to the number of nuclear missiles stored at various military
installations inside the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact countries.
``And they verified our numbers, too.''
   The first 60 days of compliance with the treaty signed by
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev last
December ended Monday when the superpowers completed all authorized
inspections.
   The so-called baseline inspections were intended to allow each
country to verify the number and location of medium-range and
shorter range nuclear weapons in each arsenal before their
destruction begins under the INF treaty.
   American inspectors had to visit 133 Soviet weapons facilities
at 115 locations during the two-month period. The Soviets had to
inspect 31 facilities at 26 sites in the United States and Western
Europe.
   The treaty, which the Senate ratified earlier this summer, calls
for the elimination within three years of all American and Soviet
land-based missiles with ranges of 300 to 3,400 miles.
   The treaty covers 859 nuclear-armed missiles on the U.S. side,
compared with 1,831 on the Soviet side.
   Defense Department spokesman Dan Howard refused to discuss
details of the inspections Tuesday but told reporters: ``I have not
seen any reports of problems with regard to the baseline
inspections.''
   ``We completed our baseline inspections and they completed
theirs,'' said Cmdr. Ken Pease, a spokesman for the Pentagon's
on-site inspection agency.
   ``The Soviets were very flexible, very professional and very
knowledgeable about the treaty, which facilitated our
inspections,'' Pease said. ``Both sides knew the terms of the
treaty and worked in a professional manner together.''
   Under the treaty, both sides next will be entitled to conduct 20
short-notice inspections over the next year at selected military
facilities.
   In addition, permanent inspection teams are on duty at Soviet
and American missile plants to guard against cheating, and
inspectors from both countries will be able to observe the actual
destruction of missiles.
   The Soviets are now operating ``elimination'' _ or destruction _
programs for missiles and launchers at five different sites, Pease
said. In addition, the Russians plan within the next week or two to
begin destroying up to 100 SS-20 missiles by launching them without
their warheads.
   The United States will begin destroying the medium-range
missiles in its arsenal on Sept. 8 by firing some solid-fuel
rockets used in Pershing II missiles at the Longhorn Army
Ammunition Plant near Marshall, Texas.

<TEXT>
   Conservationist Richard Leakey accused a
government ministry of providing little more than ``lip service''
to stop widespread poaching that has claimed 93 elephants since
April, it was reported Tuesday.
   ``It is a national crisis,'' The Standard quoted Leakey,
chairman of the East African Wildlife Society, as saying Monday.
   He said high-ranking people, whom he did not identify, were
involved in the poaching. He described it as ``economic sabotage
with far-reaching and lasting effects on the posterity, stability
and success of our country.''
   Leakey also challenged George Muhoho, minister of tourism and
wildlife, to prove his claim that 22,000 elephants remain in Kenya.
   ``We may have less than half that number in reality at this
time,'' said Leakey. ``Until a proper census is carried out, the
figure of 22,000 should be taken with caution.''
   Muhoho cited the 22,000 figure Monday when he reported to a
meeting of ornithologists that in the last four months poachers had
killed 92 elephants in several game parks, The Standard and
Nairobi's other two English-language papers, Kenya Times and Daily
Nation, reported Tuesday.
   Studies by the U.N. Environmental Program show that in the last
15 years, elephant populations have dropped 85 percent in Kenya and
that herds in Tanzania and Uganda have been similarly depleted.
   An aerial survey in February of the vast Tsavo National Park in
southeastern Kenya found 5,363 elephants, down from an estimated
35,000 in that park alone in 1974.
   An all-time high ivory price is fueling the slaughter, according
to experts who say poaching will not abate until the illegal trade
is halted.
   Muhoho said the government was trying to combat the animal
slaughter by ``increasing manpower, training and equipment
available to rangers.''
   But Leakey said rangers were equipped with inadequate weapons
against well-armed poachers and were seriously hindered by
impassable roads, broken-down vehicles and inadequate fuel supplies.
   ``The minister and his officers are urged to do more than give
lip service to the growing crisis,'' said Leakey, brother of
Kenya's only white parliamentarian, Philip Leakey, and son of noted
paleontologists Louis and Mary Leakey.

<TEXT>
   A man suspected in 60 rapes pleaded
innocent Tuesday to a 21-count indictment charging him with raping
and kidnapping five women and assaulting a sixth.
   Robert Biddings, 34, of Columbus, appeared handcuffed before
Franklin County Common Pleas Judge Frank Reda. No trial date was
set.
   Biddings, a former restaurant dishwasher, was indicted Friday
for allegedly abducting his victims, who included a 12-year-old
girl, handcuffing and raping them from 1986 to March 1988.
   He was arrested after the parents of a 24-year-old rape victim
spent more than a year pursuring her attacker. The victim's mother
stood at the same east-side bus stop where her daughter was
attacked in June 1987 and acted as a decoy while her armed husband
waited nearby.
   The woman was attacked on Aug. 5, but her husband scared off the
assailant and gave police the license number of the attacker's
vehicle. Biddings was arrested three days later.
   Biddings is suspected of being the ``handcuff rapist,'' a term
that refers to the use of handcuffs in early attacks and later was
attributed to the same man over four years.
   The indictment said Biddings had been convicted of rape in
Summit County in 1973 and served a jail term on the charge.
   In all, he was indicted on 12 counts of rape, six counts of
kidnapping, two counts of aggravated robbery and one count of
felonious assault.
   Two of Biddings' sisters were in the courtroom Tuesday but
refused to talk to reporters after the hearing.
   ``They're upset,'' said Thomas Erlenbach, Bidding's attorney.
``But they're sticking by him.''
   Biddings himself is upset by the charges, because he does not
understand the terminology in the indictments, said Erlenbach, who
was hired by the defendant's family.
   ``He does not understand a lot about it,'' he said. ``But he has
maintained his innocence to me all along.''
   County Prosecutor Michael Miller said last week he expects more
indictments against Biddings and that he would present further
evidence to the grand jury this week.
   Biddings is being held in lieu of $750,000 bond.
   Meanwhile, the 24-year-old victim urged other rape victims to
report their complaints.
   ``I want victims to know that they have to come forward. That's
the only reason I'm talking about this right now. They have to come
forward,'' the woman said in a copyright story in Tuesday's
Columbus Dispatch.
   She told the newspaper she has agreed with police not to discuss
specifics of the attack until after Biddings is tried.

   A 65-foot tall Latin cross erected 22 years
ago at a Marine base in Hawaii must be removed or replaced by a
nonreligious symbol, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan said the cross, which was
lit nightly at Camp H. M. Smith in the suburbs of Honolulu, appears
to be an unconstitutional endorsement of religion by government.
   ``The principal symbol of Christianity, this nation's dominant
religion, is too laden with religious meaning to be appropriate for
a government memorial assertedly free of any religious message,''
wrote Hogan. ``While the court is unwilling to say that a Latin
cross is ipso facto (by the fact or act itself) unconstitutional,
it is constrained to find its use inappropriate in this case.''
   However, Hogan said his order would not go into force for 60
days to give the government an opportunity to seek a further stay
from an appellate court while it appeals his decision.
   The Jewish War Veterans of the U.S.A. contended in its suit that
the wooden cross on a prominent point at the Marine base violated
the Constitution's ban on governmental endorsement of a particular
religion.
   Origin of the cross was disputed during the trial. According to
one account, the cross was built in April, 1966, for Eastern
sunrise services to which the public was invited. A former
commanding general of the Fleet Marine Force, Pacific, Lt. Gen.
Victor H. Krulak, said it was built to serve the purely secular
purpose of honoring Marines killed or missing in action in the
Vietnam war.
   Hogan noted the Constitution prohibits Congress from making any
laws respecting an establishment of religion. But the Establishment
Clause ``is not an easy area of the law,'' he said.
   Hogan said a single thread runs through decisions by federal
courts: that the Latin cross _ one whose base stem is longer than
the other three arms _ ``is a readily indentifiable symbol of
Christianity.''
   ``The 65-foot lighted cross on Bordelon Field at Camp Smith may
fairly be considered to convey a message of governmental
endorsement of Christianity,'' the judge wrote..
   ``The use of a cross as a memorial to fallen or missing
servicemen is a use of what to some is a religious symbol where a
nonreligious one likely would have done as well,'' said Hogan.

<HEAD>Farm Prices Up 2.1 Percent In Month, 13 Percent In Year</HEAD>

   Prices farmers got for raw products in August
rose 2.1 percent from July, boosted in part by the momentum of this
year's drought, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Compared with a year earlier, August prices averaged 13 percent
higher. The report also included revised figures showing that the
index roseonly 2.9 percent in July, compared with the preliminary
reading of 3.6 percent announced a month ago.
   Since April, as drought cut into this year's harvest prospects,
farm commodity prices overall have climbed 10.8 percent, according
to the latest figures.
   But there were signs that the upward spiral of some commodity
prices were beginning to level off in August.
   The department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its
preliminary report that higher prices for cattle, apples, tomatoes
and lettuce contributed most to the August increase, while prices
declined for cotton, corn, onions and soybeans.
   In the earlier months, corn and soybeans helped lead the way for
rising prices. However, by late July, widespread rains began to
dampen further increases, although the drought of 1988 has not been
broken by any means.
   At the Chicago Board of Trade on Tuesday grain and soybean
futures closed sharply higher, but it was on the strength of new
export business, not further crop losses due to drought, analysts
said. Moreover, they said, the corn and soybean crops have passed
their most critical stages of development.
   Based on Aug. 1 estimates, this year's corn harvest may drop 37
percent from 1987; wheat, 13 percent; and soybeans 23 percent.
   ``All feed grain and soybean prices declined from July, but
rough (unmilled) rice and all wheat prices increased slightly,''
the report said. ``Average prices of beef cattle and calves
increased sharply from July but were below the high levels recorded
during February through May of this year.''
   Prices of some major commodities are based on mid-month averages
and then are revised the following month when additional
information is available.
   As a commodity group, prices of feed grains and hay dropped 2.8
percent from July to August, averaging 68 percent above a year ago,
the report said.
   Prices of meat animals rose 4.3 percent as a group but averaged
0.6 percent below the year-earlier mark. Beef cattle prices
averaged $66.40 per 100 pounds of liveweight, up $3.20 from July.
Hog prices increased $1 from July to $46.80 in August.
   Apple prices at the farm level, rose to 26.1 cents per pound in
August from 19.7 cents in July and 16 cents a year ago. Lettuce was
reported at $12.20 per 100 pounds, up from $7.62 in July but far
below the $18 of last year. Tomatoes, at $41.70 per 100 pounds,
were up from $31 in July and $17.30 in August 1987.
   Overall, the August all-crops price index was up 2.3 percent
from July, averaging 33 percent above the year-ago level.
   The August price index for all livestock and livestock products
was up 3.4 percent from July and averaged 1.3 percent more than a
year earlier. Higher prices for cattle, hogs, milk, turkeys and
eggs accounted for the increase from July.
   Although the projections are subject to change, USDA economists
say that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of $55
billion to $60 billion this year, compared with the record level of
$57.1 billion in 1987. That is the difference between cash receipts
and cash expenses during the calendar year.
   Consumer food prices are expected to rise 3 percent to 5 percent
this year, compared with a 4.2 percent average increase in 1987.
Before the drought took hold, USDA was predicting a 1988 food price
hike of 2 percent to 4 percent.
   Department officials have predicted that the drought may add 2
percentage points to food prices in 1989, above the expected
increase in inflation, currently forecast at around 4 percent. That
could mean a 1989 food prices increase in the range of 6 percent to
7 percent.
   The report did not include new figures showing what farmers pay
to meet expenses. Those are reported quarterly, and the most recent
figures released in July showed farm production costs were up 2.4
percent from April, averaging 4.9 percent more than in July 1987.
   The report said:
   _Cattle averaged $66.40 per 100 pounds of live weight
nationally, up from $63.20 in July and $61.90 reported for August
1987. Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef.
   _Hogs averaged $45.40 per 100 pounds, compared with $44.10 in
July and $58.60 a year earlier.
   _Corn, at $2.66 a bushel, was down from $2.72 in July and the
average of $1.47 per bushel a year earlier.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $3.56 per bushel, compared with $3.50 in July and $2.36 a
year earlier.
   _Rice averaged $7.61 per 100 pounds, compared with $7.51 in July
and $3.74 a year earlier.
   _Soybeans were $8.40 per bushel, compared with $8.50 in July and
$5.02 a year earlier.
   _Upland cotton was reported at 55.2 cents per pound, compared
with 58.6 in July and 63.7 cents in August 1987.
   _Eggs were 59.9 cents per dozen, compared with 62.2 cents in
July and 51.9 cents a year earlier.
   _Milk was $11.60 per 100 pounds, compared with $11.40 in July
and $12.20 a year earlier.
   _Broilers were 41.9 cents per pound, live weight, compared with
42.1 cents in July and 31.7 cents a year ago.

<HEAD>South Africa Says Its Pullout Complete</HEAD>

   RUNDU, South-West Africa (AP) _ Fifty army vehicles rumbled
across a pontoon bridge Tuesday carrying the last South African
troops out of Angola, where they spent more than a year fighting in
support of anti-Marxist guerrillas.
   South Africa's army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Ian Gleeson, said
at a ceremony that nearly 1,000 soldiers crossed into South-West
Africa during the day to complete the first phase of a
U.S.-mediated regional peace initiative.
   ``As of this moment, we are out of Angola,'' Gleeson said.
   The peace effort is aimed at ending a 13-year-old war in Angola,
whose Marxist government is backed by thousands of Cuban troops.
After a Cuban withdrawal from Angola, South Africa says it will
grant independence to South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.
   An estimated 2,500 South African troops, some of them 180 miles
inside in Angola, have been leaving in stages since a cease-fire
was declared Aug. 8. They supported the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola, or UNITA.
   UNITA, also backed by the United States, is not party to the
cease-fire and was exclued from recent peace talks between Angola,
Cuba, South Africa under U.S. mediation.
   The four countries involved in the negotiations met last week in
Brazzaville, Congo, but failed to agree on timetables for
withdrawal of the estimated 50,000 troops in Angola and Namibian
independence. More talks are planned for Brazzaville next week.
   Gleeson said there were no truce violations. But later a senior
official of South Africa's Foreign Affairs Department complained
Cuban forces were put on ``red alert'' during the withdrawal.
   ``This is hardly the action of an army sure of itself or one
aiming at peace, but rather one aiming for a return to
hostilities,'' said the diplomat, Glenn Babb.
   South African and foreign journalists were flown to Rundu, on
the Angolan border, to witness the completion of the withdrawal by
South African forces, which have been inside Angola since early
1987.
   Cuban and Angolan officers serving on a cease-fire monitoring
committee also attended the ceremony while soldiers dismantled the
bridge across the Okavango River.
   ``Our governments have shown the world that we will pursue
peace,'' said Angolan Maj. Osvaldo van Dunem. ``We hope to continue
in the spirit of mutual understanding and sincerity.''
   The South African trucks crossing into Rundu carried troops and
supplies, and some towed giant G-5 long-range cannon across the
shallow river while villagers washed their clothes nearby.
   Many of the vehicles had graffiti on them, such as ``No retreat,
no surrender'' and ``Hello, mom.'' They drove into a compound that
had a banner that said ``Welcome, winners.''
   Angola is to try to keep guerrillas of the South-West African
People's Organization at least 150 miles north of the Namibian
border, Gleeson said. He said SWAPO has said it will observe a
cease-fire starting Sept. 1 but hasn't commented on whether its
guerrillas will move away from the border area.
   Gleeson said South Africa will not conduct any more ``hot
pursuit'' raids into Angola after SWAPO units.
   The Cubans reportedly have been offering to leave Angola in 24
months, apparently still too slow for the South Africans.
   ``We are not in a rush'' to leave Angola, said Cuban Col. Jesus
Falcon in Rundu. ``We are aiming to accomplish the tasks of our
government.''
   Cuba's often-stated goal is to ensure the survival of Angola's
government. A hasty Cuban withdrawal could leave the government
vulnerable to UNITA, which controls about one-third of the country.
   South Africa has intervened in Angola regularly since 1975 when
it invaded the country on the eve of Angolan independence from
Portugal. South African generals said their maximum strength in
Angola was 3,000 men, although other reports claimed the force was
twice that size during battles last October.
   News reports monitored in Lisbon, Portugal, on Tuesday said
Angolan government soldiers clashed last week with UNITA rebels.
   Rebels killed eight people traveling in a bus belonging to the
international humanitarian organization CARITAS on Thursday, the
official Angolan news agency ANGOP said.
   UNITA, in a statement also released in Lisbon, said it killed 10
government soldiers and captured two others in three separate
clashes Friday and Saturday. The statement gave rebel casualties as
four killed and 11 wounded.
   The Portuguese news agency Lusa added that 20 other Angolans
were killed in three other rebel ambushes in recent days.

   Rustlers who stole a little metal calf
didn't get far before a posse corralled them at the main gate of
Dyess Air Force Base.
   The calf is the smallest member of the popular ``Herd of Cows''
sculpture grazing near a fire station in this west Texas city.
   Valued at $1,000, the calf wasn't easy to steal. It was anchored
into concrete with large bolts that apparently were ripped loose.
The calf's left front ankle was bent, possibly during the theft
Monday.
   Two airmen were charged with third-degree felony theft, police
said Tuesday. The men, who posted $5,000 bail each, were Ricky
Cameron, 21, of Tempe, Ariz., and Carl David Edmondson, 22, whose
hometown was not known.
   The men were arrested and jailed overnight after police got a
call that two men in a white pickup were trying to siphon gas from
and damage vehicles at a hotel and apartment complex, Police Capt.
Ray Portalatin said.
   A witness noted the truck's license number and gave it to
police, who forwarded the number to the main gate at the air base.
   Military police stopped a pickup when it tried to drive onto the
base, Portalatin said. ``Lo and behold, there was a cow in it,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Nuclear Weapons Test At Nevada Site</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YUCCA FLAT, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nuclear weapon was detonated Tuesday
at the Nevada Test Site, 13 days after Soviet scientists monitored
another U.S. test at the same site in a historic breakthrough in
international relations.
   Two Soviet scientists were still on site at the time of
Tuesday's blast, but were not involved in monitoring the test. U.S.
scientists are in the Soviet Union and will monitor a test there
Sept. 14.
   Tuesday's test measured 4.9 on the Richter scale of ground
motion at the National Earthquake Information Center in Golden,
Colo.
   The test, code-named Bullfrog, was conducted at 11 a.m. PDT and
produced a ``very distinct rocking motion'' in a control center 10
miles from ground zero, according to Energy Department spokeswoman
Barbara Yoerg.
   The test was not pre-announced, as are larger tests at the
desert site.
   The Energy Department said the shot had an explosive force of
less than 150 kilotons, the limit under treaties signed in 1974 and
1976.
   The device was buried in a 1,600-foot shaft at Yucca Flat, 85
miles northwest of Las Vegas.
   It was the 10th announced shot this year and the 685th announced
since testing began in Nevada in January 1951.
   The most recent previous test was Kearsarge, which was monitored
by Soviet scientists as part of tests aimed at developing a method
of confirming treaty compliance.
   Tuesday's test was conducted by Lawrence Livermore Laboratory
and was weapons related, Ms. Yoerg said.
   She said three protesters were at the gates of the sprawling
desert site when the test was conducted, but they were more than 40
miles from ground zero.
   Ms. Yoerg said no radioactive material escaped from Tuesday's
test. The ground above the device subsided an hour after the blast,
she said. That is considered a good sign by DOE officials because
it indicates the radioactive materials have been permanently sealed
underground.

<HEAD>More than 2,200 Cubans Released; Role of Riots Debated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 2,200 Cuban detainees have been
released since last fall's riots at federal prisons in Atlanta and
Oakdale, La., and one advocate for the Cubans credits the uprisings
for their freedom.
   A former federal official, however, denies that the riots
speeded up the releases.
   ``It's unfortunate that it came to (a riot). But 2,200 of the
3,800 (in custody before the riots last November) have been
released because of the public attention the riot attracted,'' said
Gary Leshaw, an Atlanta attorney who advised the Cubans. ``The
lesson is that the government should have instituted a legitimate
review plan years before it did.''
   But Randy Levine, a former associate U.S. attorney general who
helped set up the review process that decides the detainees' fates,
said that a repatriation agreement reached last fall by the United
States and and Cuba would have had a similar effect without the
riots.
   ``It would have been set up anyway, and I think the speed (of
the releases) would have been maintained,'' he said.
   ``To say that the riot had no impact in bringing this to the
public's attention would be wrong. But to say that the riot set the
review process in place is not fair,'' Levine said.
   Final appeals are scheduled to begin this week in Washington for
the first of 73 Cuban detainees who were found to be deportable
through the review process.
   George W. Calhoun, director of the Justice Department's Mariel
Cuban review program, said he expects some cases to be decided by
late September. That could mean the deportation of some Cubans
within six weeks.
   The detainees were among more than 125,000 Cubans who came to
the United States in the 1980 Mariel boatlift. They were jailed
after their arrival because they committed crimes or were
considered risks for other reasons.
   Although more than 2,200 Cuban detainees have been released
since the riots, an additional 1,000 have been taken into federal
custody, most of them after serving time in state prisons.
   More than 2,500 Cubans are in federal custody, and the
Immigration and Naturalization Service has decided that more than
1,500 of them are too dangerous to return to society.
   Even among those inmates, few are in imminent danger of being
deported, however. Cuba has agreed to take back only people named
on a list which was compiled in 1984 and is considered outdated now.
   Calhoun said only about 500 of 2,746 people on the list are
still being held by federal authorities. Duke Austin, an INS
spokesman, said Cubans who are not on the list can be deported only
after further negotiations with the Cuban government.
   Austin said the detainees being released are not being given an
immigration status but are being ``re-paroled.'' ``As long as they
don't commit a crime, they could conceivably remain here in the
United States for the rest of their days,'' he said.

   Lebanese villagers helped Israeli troops and
local militia drive back a Palestinian guerrilla squad trying to
infiltrate Israel Tuesday, the army and Israel radio said. Two
guerrillas were captured and two escaped.
   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, Palestinians began a
two-day strike to protest deportations. Arab hospital officials
said troops wounded 12 Palestinians in West Bank clashes, 10 of
them in Nablus.
   The infiltration attempt was the 17th reported since
Palestinians began rebelling against Israeli rule nearly nine
months ago.
   The uprising has killed 255 Palestinians and four Israelis since
Dec. 8.
   Israel radio identified the guerrillas as members of a small
pro-Syrian Palestinian faction, the Popular Struggle Front.
   A firefight broke out after Lebanese villagers from Khalata, 2{
miles north of the Israeli border, spotted the squad walking out of
a ravine and moving across a field, Israel radio and military
sources said.
   Ten Lebanese men in the village armed themselves and villagers
summoned Lebanese militiamen from the mostly Christian South
Lebanon Army, who were backed by Israeli troops from border zone
patrols, the reports said.
   The army said two guerrillas were captured and two escaped, one
after being wounded.
   Two Lebanese militiamen were slightly wounded, the radio said.
   It was the first time Israel has reported that Lebanese
villagers helped thwart a border crossing.
   An army statement said an investigation showed ``the terrorists
planned to take hostages in one of the settlements in the northern
Galilee.''
   The intruders carried barbed wire cutters, three Soviet-made
rifles, a pistol with a silencer, four hand grenades, three
rocket-propelled grenade lauchers and food and medical supplies.
   Israel ended a three-year occupation of Lebanon in 1985 but
maintains about 1,000 soldiers in its self-declared security zone
to lend support to the South Lebanon Army.
   The army said youths stoned an Israeli car in the West Bank
village of Anabta, slightly wounding one passenger in the head. In
Husan, near Bethlehem, troops rounded up residents and searched
homes after villagers stoned an Israeli bus, Arab reports said. The
army said it was checking the report.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir personally intervened to have a
submachine gun returned to a Jewish settler in the West Bank.
Police confiscated the weapon last week after the man fired in the
air to disperse Palestinians stoning his car near a West Bank
refugee camp.
   Shamir ``believes that people who live in Judea and Samaria
(biblical names for the West Bank) should be allowed to carry
weapons for self-defense,'' said Shamir aide Avi Pazner.
   Israel radio on Tuesday quoted Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin as
saying that recently introduced plastic bullets would ease the
frustration of soldiers trying to quell violent protests. Rabin
addressed a closed-door session of Parliament's Defense and Foreign
Affairs Committee.
   A defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
live ammunition can be used only in self-defense, but officers may
fire plastic bullets in ``hot pursuit'' of Palestinian
demonstrators or to incapacitate ringleaders. Plastic bullets
penetrate the body but generally cause less serious injuries.
   Tuesday's strike in the occupied territories and east Jerusalem,
seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, was the fifth such
protest in 10 days.
   Nablus was the scene of the most violent protests after a
five-day curfew was lifted at dawn.
   Troops trying to disperse stone-throwers shot and wounded 10
Palestinians, including two who were in serious condition, hospital
officials said. The army said five Arabs were hurt.
   Two Palestinians were wounded in two other West Bank clashes,
hospital officials said.
   The strike was to protest deportations of 33 Palestinians since
the uprising began, and Israeli orders to expell 25 others.
   In Jerusalem, about 150 Israeli leftists demonstrated near the
Supreme Court to protest deportations.
   The army clamped curfews on three refugee camps and a village in
the occupied lands, confining more than 100,000 Palestinians to
their homes.
   The army said Tuesday that 5,116 Palestinians now are being held
in Israeli jails, including 2,516 held for up to six months without
trial.

<HEAD>Army Extends Comment Deadline On Biological Warfare Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army, prompted by the governor of Utah,
announced Tuesday it was extending into October the public comment
deadline on a draft environmental impact study covering its
biological warfare research program.
   Lt. Col. John Chapla, an Army spokesman, said Utah Gov. Norman
Bangerter had requested a public hearing be held in his state ``and
we saw no reason not to accomodate him.''
   As a result, the deadline for public comment has been extended
to Oct. 4 and a public hearing has been scheduled at the Tooele
Army Depot in Utah on Sept. 19, Chapla said.
   ``The Biological Defense Research Program is of interest to
citizens of Utah because it is conducted in part at Dugway Proving
Ground,'' the service added in a statement.
   The Utah hearing will be the second held by the Army since it
released its draft impact statement _ a massive study designed to
support biological warfare research work at facilities around the
country. The Army has portrayed the research work in that study as
safe to the environment, essential to national security and a boon
to science in general.
   ``In recognition of the potentially hazardous nature of (this)
type of research ... the Defense Department as well as the
scientific community has developed and implemented elaborate
controls to assure adequate protection for the workforce and
virtually total protection for the external environment,'' the Army
concluded in the draft assessment.
   The environmental study, released last May, was prompted by a
lawsuit filed by the Foundation on Economic Trends in September
1986. The foundation is a Washington-based environmental activist
group that has long focused its attention on the dangers of
biological research and genetic engineering.
   After forcing the Army to conduct the study, the foundation
attacked the draft work as ``shoddy and incomplete,'' vowing to
launch a new legal assault if a more complete study was not
performed.
   In releasing the draft study last May, the Army said it would
accept written comments from the public only through Aug. 12. That
deadline has been put aside and the new deadline of Oct. 4
established, the Army said Tuesday.
   Within the biological field, the United States has committed
itself by international treaty not to develop offensive biological
weapons. However, the Pentagon _ through the Army _ maintains a
large defensive program, aimed at developing vaccines and
antidotes, detection systems and battlefield gear that could be
used to protect American soldiers if attacked with natural or
man-made poisons.
   In order to develop such defenses, laboratories must work with a
variety of deadly toxins.
   According to the Pentagon, roughly $60 million is now being
spent every year on the research, which is conducted at more than
100 military, university and private laboratories in 27 states and
eight foreign countries.

   A former president of the Southern Baptist
Convention said that while abortion is ``an abomination before
God,'' he opposes tactics of the anti-abortion protesters that have
led to hundreds of arrests this summer.
   The Rev. Charles Stanley, pastor of the First Baptist Church of
Atlanta, issued the two-page treatise Sunday saying abortion should
be protested only through lawful means.
   The leaflet, ``A Biblical Perspective on Civil Disobedience,''
said it represents the ``carefully studied view of the pastoral
staff and deacons'' of the church, the state's largest Baptist
congregation.
   In the leaflet, the ministers reaffirmed the Southern Baptist
stance against abortion, saying, ``We strongly oppose abortion as
an abomination before God. We also advocate all lawful means of
protesting abortion.''
   More than 700 demonstrators have been arrested in Atlanta in
protests organized by the New York-based Operation Rescue since the
group arrived during the Democratic National Convention in July.
   The leaflet, which Stanley read from the pulpit, cites biblical
grounds for disobeying the law and concludes that Operation
Rescue's tactics fail in three areas:
   _Protesters have been charged with criminal trespassing,
obstructing rights of way or other similar ordinances _ not for
directly preventing abortions. ``If certain anti-God protesters
blocked the entrance to (the church) so we could not enter to
worship, we would use the same ordinance to have them arrested!''
   _The U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion ``neither
requires abortions nor prohibits them, but makes them permissible
with certain restrictions.''
   _Women are ``free moral agents responsible before Almighty God
for their actions, including the exercise of the rights of their
innocent, unborn child.''
   Operation Rescue leader Randall Terry, who has directed his
demonstrations mostly with the help of clergy and supporters from
outside Atlanta, responded:
   ``We are glad Dr. Stanley agrees that abortion is murder. We
wish he could also see that Operation Rescue is not about protest
or civil disobedience. It is about saving the lives of babies
scheduled to be murdered.''
   Stanley had been silent on the issue of civil disobedience since
watching a protest several weeks ago where his friend Jerry
Falwell, the Moral Majority founder and an independent Baptist,
appeared and offered his endorsement. Falwell, who gave Operation
Rescue $10,000, said he would return to be arrested and had
predicted that Stanley would join the protests.

   U.S. Rep. Claude Pepper borrowed
Tuesday from Madison Avenue as he went to work for the Democratic
ticket, telling senior citizens that Vice President George Bush and
running mate Sen. Dan Quayle are ``the Un-COLA team.''
   Pepper told more than 200 people that Quayle in the past seven
years voted eight times to freeze or cut Social Security
cost-of-living-adjustments, while Bush, in his role as head of the
Senate, in 1985 cast the tie-breaking vote to freeze ``COLAS'' in a
budget resolution.
   ``You might call this Republican team the Un-Cola team of
America, and you know Americans like colas,'' Pepper said, taking
off on the soda pop advertising in a speech that marked the
beginning of his planned nationwide campaigning for the Democratic
ticket of Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen.
   He said Dukakis lobbied for the ``Pepper bill,'' defeated in
June in the U.S. House, to provide long-term home health care for
the chronically ill. Dukakis has pledged to seek its passage as
president, Pepper said, while Bentsen sponsored similar legislation
in the Senate.
   Pepper called Bush ``a very fine gentleman'' with ``a lovely
wife,'' but said Bush ``has to carry on his shoulders a Reagan
administration without Reagan.''
   He recalled that at a meeting in Philadelphia in 1980, candidate
Reagan promised not to cut senior programs, but didn't keep his
word. Pepper said Bush followed an administration philosophy that
has hurt millions of people.
   He said Quayle's voting record ``is just totally opposite of the
best interests of senior citizens.''
   The crowd, led by Miami Beach Mayor Alex Daoud, serenaded Pepper
with ``Happy Birthday.'' He turns 88 on Sept. 8, and promised a
public birthday celebration Sept. 10 at Miami's Bayfront Park.

   Here is a brief outline of forest fire conditions Tuesday in the
Western states:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WYOMING:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Eight forest fires are burning in Yellowstone National Park with
four in the surrounding national forests in northwestern Wyoming.
   The Yellowstone Fires, some of which have spread out into the
forests, had charred about 450,000 acres of the 2.2 million-acre
park. The largest fire outside Yellowstone, the Mink Creek fire,
covers 107,960 acres of the Bridger-Teton National Forest.
   Yellowstone officials said they have spent $54.4 million
fighting fires and about 8,400 firefighters, including hundreds of
Army soldiers, are working in the area.
   Unusually dry weather and a rash of lightning storms opened the
fire season early this year, with the first Yellowstone fires
reported in June.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MONTANA:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Eight major fires had burned 177,000 acres of Montana forests
Tuesday, including two that erupted into serious threats overnight.
They ranged in size up to 41,000 acres. Four, totaling 128,700
acres, were in designated wilderness areas, including one that had
spread into Yellowstone National Park. Firefighters were gaining
the upper hand on most, however, and no populated areas were
threatened.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>IDAHO:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   More than 2,500 firefighters, backed up by dozens of National
Guardsmen, were on the lines against the worst of 17 fires burning
over 70,000 acres from the Panhandle National Forest to the Caribou
National Forest on the Wyoming border.
   No structures were in imminent danger, but crews were protecting
summer homes from the 16,000-acre Battle Axe wilderness fire
northeast of Challis, a communications site from the 330-acre West
Jay fire in the Clearwater National Forest east of Lewiston and
ranches from the 5,000-acre Trail Creek fire near the Wyoming
border in the Caribou. Some $3 million in commercial timber has
been lost, mostly to the 7,400-acre Eagle Bar fire near Hells
Canyon on the Oregon border.
   The terrain is parched by a second straight year of drought, and
Gov. Cecil Andrus has put the entire state under an extreme fire
emergency.

<HEAD>OREGON:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Forces battling Oregon's biggest forest fire, the 31,000-acre
lightning-sparked Tepee Butte blaze in the northeastern corner of
the state, were doubled Tuesday to 545 people, said spokesman Ron
DeHart.
   The Walker Mountain fire outside Grants Pass was contained
Monday night at 2,150 acres.
   In the eastern high desert, a fire at a cement plant in Durkee
quickly burned through 5,000 acres of rangeland, and a trash fire
touched off 527 acres on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CALIFORNIA:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 9,500 lightning strikes Monday and early Tuesday ignited
more than 100 brush and timber blazes in California, a year after a
similar storm spawned devastating firestorms, officials said.
   Although most of the fires were kept small, to the size of an
acre or less, firefighters said they were by hot, windy weather in
the drought-parched forests.
   The town of Portola in the northern Sierra Nevada, about 180
miles northeast of San Francisco, narrowly escaped flames Monday
night when lightning-caused fires swept together. The fires that
had burned about 1,000 acres were 60 percent contained Tuesday.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WASHINGTON:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Forest Service said it battled fires on an estimated 22,530
acres during the past week, said Ron DeHart of a multi-agency fire
regional fire coordinating center at Portland, Ore.
   Tim Boyd of the state Department of Natural Resources said that
agency had fought 690 fires on 5,557 acres of private and state
land as of Sunday. That figure does not include the 1,500-acre
Aeneas Creek blaze northeast of Republic, nor several smaller fires
of less than 100 acres in eastern Washington.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>UTAH:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Firefighters hoped to declare control over a 525-acre fire near
northern Utah's Pineview Reservoir. Crews also were getting the
upper hand on two small fires, the 60-acre North Millcreek blaze,
in eastern Utah's Uinta Mountains, and the 30-acre Butterfield
Canyon fire in Salt Lake County.
   No injuries or damage were reported in any of the fires, and
authorities said no structures were threatened.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ALASKA:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   As of Tuesday, there were 30 fires still smoldering on 2 million
acres in rural Alaska, the federal Bureau of Land Management said.
   ``We're monitoring them, but not fighting them,'' said Sue
Mitchell, a spokeswoman for the agency. ``I don't think we have any
blazing, active fires right now.''
   So far this year, fires have charred 2.1 million acres of land
in Alaska.

<HEAD>US Praises Laos for Drug Crackdown</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department praised the Laotian
government Tuesday for its recent arrest and conviction of 48
persons on drug smuggling charges.
   While crediting Laos with ``strong action against drug
traffickers,'' department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said some
Laotian authorities may be promoting narcotics trafficking with the
support of the central government.
   She said that among those convicted was a member of the
Communist Party Central Committee who also served as a provincial
governor. He was given a seven-year sentence.
   The department's position Tuesday differed from its conclusion
in a report prepared last spring that Laos was the only nation
``for which the preponderance of information suggests that the
government promotes drug trafficking as a matter of policy.''
   The report, which covered several countries suspected of
involvement in drug smuggling, was dated May 1. The National
Security Council ordered it withheld from members of Congress until
last week because it contained sensitive information. The study was
released to the media Tuesday.
   One U.S. official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity,
said recent actions by Laotian authorities indicates their attitude
on the drug issue may be changing.
   The May report said there was coordinated participation among
Laotian government officials in drug smuggling and suggested this
could not have taken place without the approval of authorities in
Vientiane.
   ``Specifically, the U.S. finds that Laotian officials have
become involved directly in the processing of opium and marijuana,
including three marijuana processing centers run by government
organizations and at least four sanctioned heroin laboratories,''
the report said.
   The government also allows independent traffickers to operate on
Laotian territory, said the study, which observed that large
portions of the country are not under Vientiane's effetive control.
   It said the Northern Lao Import@Export Co. is a government
agency suspected of marketing narcotics abroad. The Mountain Area
Development Co., described as a state enterprise controlled by the
military, is alleged to be the chief agency involved in narcotics
trafficking, the report said.
   Governments found to be engaged in drug smuggling are subject to
U.S. sanctions prescribed by Congress. But no action was taken
against Laos because President Reagan decided that Laotian
cooperation in accounting for missing American servicemen might
otherwise be impaired.
   In any case, sanctions imposed against Laos would be largely
symbolic because Laos receives no U.S. assistance.
   The administration has concluded that Panamanian leader Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, commander of Panama's Defense Forces, has
engaged in drug smuggling activities. But the report said Noriega
``is not a senior official'' of Panama because the United States
regards the ousted government of President Eric Arturo Delvalle as
the legitimate authority in Panama.
   Therefore, Noriega was considered beyond the scope of the
report, which is aimed primarily at government officials who engage
in drug trafficking.

<HEAD>Dukakis Lashes Out at Bush's Role in Iran-Contra; Veep Raises
Defense Issue</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: INSERTS 1 graf after 5th graf, `Dukakis bargained,' to UPDATE
with comment from Dukakis spokesman.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis said Tuesday that George Bush flunked a key
``test of leadership'' in the Iran-Contra affair and questioned
whether his Republican rival has the judgment needed to deal with
the Soviet Union. Bush shot back that Dukakis favors ``unilateral
cuts'' in U.S. defenses.
   The two contenders for the White House swapped charges in their
escalating war of campaign words as their top aides met in
Washington without agreeing on a schedule for presidential debates
this fall.
   Bush campaign chairman James A. Baker III said the Republicans
would accept two presidential debates and one confrontation between
vice presidential contenders, but nothing before Sept. 22. Dukakis
aide Paul Brountas said he favored a more extensive schedule.
   ``We want more debates, they want fewer,'' he said. ``We want to
start them earlier, they want to start them later. We want to
continue them up until the election takes place. They would like to
end them much earlier,'' he added. The two sides will meet again on
Thursday.
   Dukakis bargained through aides with Bush over debates as fresh
reports surfaced of lingering tensions with Jesse Jackson, the
Democratic nominee's most persistent rival during the primary
campaign. One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Jackson met with top Dukakis aides last week and was angered when
he was handed a list of states to avoid during the fall campaign _
including several where he won primaries and caucuses earlier this
year.
   But Dukakis spokesman Dayton Duncan called the report about the
list ``absolutely false.''
   Dukakis, who has sharpened his rhetoric in the face of
widespread published reports that he has lost the campaign
offensive, said Bush was a failure as a crime fighter and misguided
on defense matters, and he resurrected the Iran-Contra affair as a
campaign issue.
   ``Making tough decisions is a test of leadership. George Bush
endorsed the decision to sell arms to Iran and in doing so he
failed that test,'' Dukakis said.
   Referring to the Iran-Contra affair, dealings with Panama's
indicted leader Manuel Antonio Noriega and Bush's support during
the early 1980s for ousted Philippines President Ferdinand E.
Marcos, Dukakis said, ``And he's talking about judgment, about
negotiations, about taking risks. I would be very concerned about
someone with that kind of judgment negotiating with the Soviet
Union.''
   Bush kept up his own steady drumbeat of criticism as he
campaigned in North Carolina. ``We should not gamble America's
future on another liberal governor coming out of nowhere,'' he
said, likening Dukakis to former President Carter.
   Later, Bush said Dukakis wants ``to make unilateral cuts in our
strategic systems, the MX, the Midgetman, no testing, get rid of
two (aircraft) carrier groups, as well.''
   The vice president also cautioned against complacency in dealing
with the Soviet Union. ``I'm glad there is change in the Soviet
Union,'' he said. ``But we'd better not let our guard down.''
   Bush said he was encouraged by recent ``polling things''
indicating an unturn in his fortunes in recent weeks. ``That's
turned around now after our upbeat Republican convention,'' he said.
   Dukakis aides scheduled a briefing with reporters for Wednesday.
They are expected to emphasize that despite a recent Republican
trend in the polls, their campaign is on track with television
commercials set to begin running within the next two weeks, an
organization in place in most of the 50 states and an estimated $25
million raised for the fall campaign.
   The money will be used in addition to the $46 million subsidy
that both presidential tickets receive from the federal government.
   Despite plans for Dukakis to campaign jointly with Jackson,
there were indications that relations between the former rivals
were strained.
   Top Dukakis campaign aides met Thursday with Jackson to discuss
his role in the fall campaign, and a source said these aides
arrived with a list of states where they asked Jackson not to
campaign.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the list
included Michigan, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia and Texas.
Jackson carried all but Texas and Georgia during the Democratic
primary season, and finally, the two sides agreed he would campaign
in all but Texas this fall.
   Also left undecided was whether any top Jackson campaign aides
would move into a substantive role in the Dukakis national campaign
organization.
   Dukakis referred only briefly to Jackson during the day, saying,
``It's going to take a little longer to fully integrate the
campaign, but I'm pleased.''
   Instead, he focused his fire on Bush.
   Dukakis said Bush's record on crime was a ``blank. On the rare
occasions when the vice president has been asked to do something on
this subject, it's been a failure,'' he said.
   Dukakis also said Bush ``wants them all'' when it comes to new
weapons, and ``you can't have them all,'' particularly in view of
the federal deficit.
   Dukakis also chose the day to resurrect the Iran-Contra affair
as a campaign issue.
   He said that Bush was head of an anti-terrorism task force that
had issued a report denouncing any concessions to terrorist nations.
   ``The president and the vice president and a number of other
people ... proceeded to do precisely what that commission said you
should never do,'' he said.
   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle spoke to a
meeting of fire fighters in Washington and noted wryly that he'd
gained a lot of experience in recent weeks in their line of work.
   ``Where were you when I needed you,'' he said in a reference to
the controversy that erupted over his service in the National Guard.

<HEAD>UN Teams Warns Of Riots When Iranian POWs Are Repatriated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many Iranian and Iraqi prisoners of war
fear persecution if they return home and some Iraqis may riot
against repatriation, say U.N. investigators who visited their
camps.
   Prisoner camps in Iran are ruled internally by zealous Iraqi
POWs who have switched their loyalty to Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini,
the U.N. experts said in a report scheduled for release Thursday.
The Associated Press saw a copy of the report Tuesday.
   ``In each camp we visited (in Iran), there were fanatical,
hysterical and sometimes violent demonstrations by the prisoners,
who were assembled inside, along the barbed wire fences,'' the
three U.N. experts reported.
   Iraqi prisoners shouted slogans denouncing Iraq's President
Saddam Hussein and the superpowers, and praised Islam and Khomeini,
the investigators said, and rallies were so fervid at the Arak and
Davoudieh camps that they could not enter safely.
   About half the prisoners participated in each case and clearly
were under the influence of 10-20 percent or the group, the report
said. The team visited the camps in late July and early August.
   Camp committees provide religious and political instruction and
persuasion under the name ``spiritual guidance,'' the experts said,
and ``to us, it is indistinguishable from mental pressure.''
   In the camps in Iran holding Iraqi prisoners, the team
concluded, ``There is a risk that riots may break out, for example
in the moment when transfer is to take place with a view to
registration and repatriation.''
   In the camps in Iraq, the Iranian POWs were more orderly and
Iraqi authorities maintained control, but many prisoners also
appeared hesitant about going home after the 8-year-old war.
   ``The majority, however, seemed inclined to return to Iran,
provided they were given effective gurantees that they would not be
subject to persecution on their return,'' the report said. ``In the
absence of such guarantees, however, their future looks gloomy.''
   Iran listed 46,098 POWs in its camps but many new prisoners had
not been registered so the U.N. team decided the number could be
about 70,000.
   Iraq furnished a list of 18,139 POWs as of Aug. 1, but Iraqi
authorities told the team many new prisoners had not been
registered. The investigators decided the total could be about
35,000.
   Conditions in the camps of both sides ``are, on the whole,
acceptable, although it might be desirable to have them further
improved on some points,'' the report said.
   Pro-Khomeini Iraqis dominating Iran's camps reject Western
institutions, including the International Committee of the Red
Cross, which registers prisoners of war and looks after their
welfare, the investigators said.
   Because they view the Red Cross as ineffective and dominated by
the West, many have refused to register with it, complicating the
repatriation process.
   The U.N. team also found, however, that some Iraqi POWs were
never given a chance by Iranian authorities to register with the
Red Cross or were dissuaded by the pro-Khomeini Iraqi prisoners.
   According to the report, Iranian authorities cooperated in
verifying the whereabouts of ``nearly all'' 7,327 Iraqi POWs
registered by the Red Cross before 1984 who were listed as missing,
showing them to be safe and alive in or out of POW camps.
   Iraqi authorities cooperated in tallying about 25,000 Iranian
Kurds, 30,000 Iranian Arabs, and more than 300 other Iranians
listed by Iran as missing.
   Iraq said they sought asylum and were in three refugee camps.
The U.N. team found the facilities similar to POW camps, surrounded
by barbed wire, but the residents had relative freedom of movement.
   More than 200 POWs held by Iran are from Syria, Lebanon, Egypt,
Sudan or Somalia, the team said. Iran has called them
``mercenaries'' but has promised to free them.
   Iran and Iraq have accused each other of the torture and
maltreatment of POWs.
   In Iran, the U.N. team said, ``We never saw any direct evidence
of atrocities, torture or beating; but from the conversations we
had with some prisoners we cannot dismiss allegations that such
acts have occurred.''
   In Iraq's Camp Number Nine in the Ramadi region, the team found
abuse that ``did not seem typical of Iraqi camps at large.''
   Members of the U.N. team were Maj. Gen. Rene Bats of Belgium;
Wolfram Karl, an Austrian professor of international law, and
Torkel Opsahl of Norway, also a professor of international law.
   They visited Iran's camps July 23-30 and the Iraqi camps July
31-Aug. 5.

<HEAD>Agriculture Dept. Says Some Support Loans Won't Be Extended</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department said Tuesday it
will not extend certain crop price support loans made to farmers,
including some that begin to come due on Aug. 31.
   Milton Hertz, executive vice president of the department's
Commodity Credit Corp., said the action is consistent with loan
extension decisions that the Agriculture Department announced in
January and March.
   The proposal leading up to the decision has been criticized as
heavy-handed by some farm groups, and is involved in a legal
challenge by a group of farmers in U.S. District Court in St. Paul,
Minn.
   In the past, the department has frequently allowed farmers to
extend their regular nine-month price support loans for an
additional year or longer as a way of keeping surplus grain off the
market.
   When ``locked up'' in the loan program, or in the farmer-owned
reserve or FOR, grain cannot be sold on the market until the loan
is settled. When the loans come due, farmers have the option paying
the loans in full or forfeiting their crops to the Commodity Credit
Corp.
   Hertz said the following loans will not be extended:
   _1987 and subsequent crop price support regular loans for feed
grains, rice, soybeans and wheat.
   _1985 and 1986 crop extended loans of wheat, barley, oats and
soybeans.
   _1983 and prior crop-year loans for commodities in the FOR.
   _Special producer loans.
   Hertz said the following loans can be extended at the producer's
option for one year:
   _1985 and 1986 crop corn and sorghum extended loans which mature
on March 31 through Dec. 31 this year.
   _1984 crop FOR loans which mature on March 31 through Dec. 31
this year.
   In addition, he said, 1987 crops of wheat and feed grains will
not be permitted to enter the FOR.

<HEAD>Stress May Be Factor In Bizarre String Of Scientists' Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stress cannot be ruled out as the cause of some of
the mysterious deaths and disappearances in Britain's defense and
electronics industry, a union said Tuesday.
   The Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union said it recently
surveyed technical, managerial and professional staff in six
companies and found many experience high stress levels and fewer
than 4 percent are happy in their jobs.
   Sixteen men employed in defense or security work _ including
seven who worked for Marconi Co. Ltd. or its related companies _
have died in unusual circumstances since 1982.
   Many of the men died in unexplained, even bizarre circumstances.
Most deaths resembled suicides, although only two have been so
ruled.
   ``Stress cannot be ruled out as a contributing factor in the
spate of Marconi deaths,'' said Larry Brooke, the union's national
officer.
   ``The people who have died were overwhelmingly in responsible
positions. The electronics industry is highly competitive and the
defense side has undergone an immense change over the last five
years. The screw has been tightened and more and more pressure has
been piled on,'' he said.
   Brooke called for employers in the industry to ``treat people at
work like people and not numbers'' in an attempt to ease the
pressure.
   The union surveyed employees at Marconi, Racal, Plessey Co. PLC,
Ferranti, Philips and Thorn EMI, all major electronics companies
with a sizeable involvement in government defense work.
   It found only 3.5 percent said they were happy and fulfilled in
their work, and 41 percent said they were dissatisfied with their
work environment to the point where they said it affected their
home life and health.
   Nearly one-quarter said they often found it difficult to relax
and the same proportion complained of bringing their problems home
and of feeling constantly drained and lethargic.
   The survey results are based on 500 replies to 2,000
questionnaires distributed to union members and non-members in the
industry.
   The British government has said the spate of deaths and
disappearances is odd but has insisted the frequency of deaths is a
coincidence and has rejected calls for an inquiry.
   The string of deaths dates from March 1982 when Keith Bowden, a
45-year-old expert on supercomputers and computer-controlled
aircraft, drove his car off a highway and down a railway
embankment. Police said he had been drinking, but friends denied it.
   Among the succeeding deaths was a computer systems analyst for a
Marconi unit who killed himself by tying a rope to a tree, looping
the other end around his neck and then driving off in his car at
high speed.
   A computer expert for Easams, a Marconi sister company, drove
his car, its trunk loaded with tanks of gasoline, into a vacant
restaurant and burned to death.
   Three of the men died in or under their cars in fume-filled
garages, and a digital communications expert fell from a hotel room
in the Ivory Coast after expressing fear for his life.
   Most recently, John Ferry was found electrocuted Aug. 24 in his
apartment at the headquarters of Marconi Command and Control
Systems Ltd. at Frimley, 35 miles southwest of London. The former
army brigadier, 60, was an assistant marketing director with
special responsibility for liaison with the armed forces.
   His widow said the pressure of his secret work may have
contributed to his death.

   George Bush's campaign said Tuesday the
Republican nominee was willing to meet Michael Dukakis in two
debates and hold a third between their running mates. But the
Dukakis campaign held out for at least one more debate.
   A meeting between the top officials of both campaigns ended with
disagreement over both the number and timing of debates between the
presidential nominees.
   There was no decision on who would sponsor the debates or on
what the format would be _ but both sides agreed to meet again
Thursday for more negotiations.
   ``We want more debates; they want fewer,'' said Paul Brountas,
campaign chairman for Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee.
   ```We want to start them earlier; they want to start them
later,'' Brountas said. ``We want to continue them up until the
election takes place; they would like to end them much earlier.''
   James A. Baker III, chairman of the Republican nominee's
campaign, said the Bush campaign has offered to hold two
presidential debates and a third between the vice presidential
nominees, with the first coming as early as Sept. 22.
   That date would rule out, however, rival proposals for debates
on Sept. 8, sponsored by the League of Women Voters, and on Sept.
14, sponsored by a bipartisan commission set up by both parties to
hold the debates.
   ``Provided that the issues of format and staging and so forth
are resolved, the vice president has agreed to debate twice, and we
have agreed that there could be a vice presidential debate,'' Baker
said.
   Baker said the commission's proposed second debate on Sept. 25
``would be agreeable with us.''
   Both officials spoke after a two-hour private meeting in the
Washington offices of Brountas' law firm. Brountas and campaign
manager Susan Estrich represented Dukakis, and Bush was represented
by Baker; media adviser Roger Ailes; and campaign aide Bob Goodwin.
   They met as the public debate over debates continued from both
sides of the presidential campaign.
   Dukakis, in Massachusetts, pressed Bush anew to meet him in
debate and charged the Republicans ``don't want to debate'' the
Reagan administration's record. Bush, in North Carolina, declared
``there will be debates'' but said too many would be ``boring.''
   Baker, explaining the Bush campaign's opposition to a third
presidential debate, said that ``the campaign is a continuing
debate'' and that the Bush offer was for as many debates as were
held in the 1984 campaign.
   ``We're not afraid of three (presidential debates) at all,''
Baker said. ``... But there are other ways to campaign. Debates
have a way of freezing the campaign, during their pendency, and
we're quite anxious that we continue to campaign the way in which
we've been campaigning over the course of the past couple weeks.''
   Bush chief of staff Craig Fuller told reporters traveling with
Bush that the proposal for two presidential and one vice
presidential debates was ``a firm position'' and ``our only
offer.'' He pointed to Dukakis's experience as a debater and said,
``We're cognizant of the fact that it's one of his areas of
expertise.''
   Brountas said that Bush's negotiators had ruled out devoting the
first debate to foreign policy and national security issues _ the
subjects Dukakis wants to debate first.
   ``One of the reasons is that would create very high expectations
in light of the vice president's experience over the past seven and
a half years, and they don't want to be confronted with those high
expectations,'' Brountas said.
   Estrich said the Bush negotiators objected to holding a debate
within two weeks of Election Day because ``they wouldn't have time
to recover from a potential disastrous mistake at that debate.''
   Complicating the argument over when to hold the debates are
major sporting events which will occupy much of evening television
network time during the fall. The professional football season
begins Sunday and the Olympics get under way Sept. 17 and run for
two weeks. Both events are followed by baseball's World Series.
   Estrich said Dukakis wants to begin the debates with the
Commission on Presidential Debates' proposal for a Sept. 14 debate
in Annapolis, Md., because it is virtually the last date possible
before the Olympics. Because the Bush campaign refused to meet on
that date, the Dukakis campaign asked for a substitute date for
that debate.
   Similarly, Estrich said Dukakis wants a final debate on Oct. 25,
26 or 27, in hopes the World Series would no longer provide a
distraction to viewers.
   The talks did not resolve the dispute over sponsorship of
thedebates. The Dukakis campaign has accepted the proposal of the
commission, which was established with the Republican and
Democratic party chairmen.
   The League of Women Voters, sponsor of fall debates in the last
three presidential elections, has proposed a debate Sept. 8 in
Birmingham, Ala., followed by debates Oct. 6 in Minneapolis, Minn.;
Oct. 23 in Boston; and Nov. 1 in Los Angeles.
   League president Nancy Neuman offered to help mediate, and said
the lingering dispute is evidence of the political parties'
``inexperience in debates sponsorship.''
   After Annapolis on Sept. 14, the commission wants other debates
on Sept. 25 in Winston-Salem, N.C.; Oct. 11 in Omaha, Neb.; and
Oct. 27 in Pittsburgh. The Omaha debate could be for the vice
presidential candidates.
   In 1984, President Reagan met Democrat Walter Mondale in two
debates, on Oct. 7 and Oct. 21, and a third debate was held Oct. 11
between their running mates. In 1980, Reagan and President Carter
met in one debate, on Oct. 28. In 1976, President Ford met Carter
in three debates, and their running mates also held a debate.

   Two cities protested to the Japanese government and
U.S. military authorities Tuesday about a planned visit of American
warships that may carry nuclear weapons and a U.S. warplane that
dumped fuel on a town.
   The city council in Yokosuka, where the U.S. Navy has a base,
passed a resolution unanimously asking the government to seek
cancellation of a visit by the cruiser USS Bunker Hill and the
destroyer USS Fife, city spokesman Junichi Ito said.
   Ito said they are due at Yokosuka, south of Tokyo, on Wednesday.
   He quoted the resolution as saying the ships may carry
nuclear-tipped Tomahawk missiles in violation of Japan's ban on the
possession, production or presence of nuclear arms.
   In Yamato, southwest of Tokyo, Mayor Takatoshi Inoue protested
to the U.S. military about a A-6 aircraft that dumped fuel on the
town Monday night in an apparent emergency, city spokesman
Toshiyuki Saeki said.
   He said a 48-year-old housewife was splashed with jet fuel as
she walked home.
   Inoue said cockpit light indicated a fire aboard the jet, and
the pilot dumped fuel as a safety measure, but authorities found no
evidence of fire aboard.
   The news agency Kyodo said a U.S. military spokesman apologized
and said U.S. authorities would consider paying compensation to the
housewife and people whose cars were splashed with fuel.

<HEAD>Number of Americans Behind on Payments Up in Spring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of Americans behind on their
mortgage payments rose in the April-June quarter for the second
time in 2{ years, an organization of lenders said Tuesday.
   The Mortgage Bankers Association of America said the number of
homeowners who were at least 30 days late in making a mortgage
payment edged up to 4.90 percent of the 9.8 million mortgages
surveyed in the second quarter.
   The increase in late mortgage payments was the second rise since
the fourth quarter of 1985.
   The delinquency rate had fallen in the first quarter to 4.78
percent after rising in the last three months of 1987 to 4.95
percent. The third quarter 1987 level _ 4.71 percent _ was the
lowest in eight years.
   Warren Lasko, executive vice president of the association,
called the latest increase ``disturbing.''
   ``However,'' he said in a statement, ``one quarter does not make
a trend, and this uptick should be kept in perspective.''
   The Mortgage Bankers' report said employment growth and rising
wages should continue to shrink the delinquency rate in future
quarters.
   Despite the slightly higher delinquency rate in the second
quarter, foreclosures held steady at 0.27 percent, the same as in
the January-March period and the last three months of 1987.
   Even with the latest rise in the delinquency rate from the
previous quarter, all regions of the country had a lower
delinquency rate when compared with a year earlier.
   The Northeast had the lowest delinquency rate, 3.78 in the
second quarter, down from 4.13 percent a year earlier. It was
followed by the West, where the delinquency rate dropped from 4.14
percent to 4.05 percent over a year.
   The South, where some states have been hard hit by the
depression in the oil industry, had the highest delinquency rate,
5.19 percent, a scant improvement from 5.21 percent a year earlier.
The second quarter rate in North Central states was 4.89 percent,
down from 4.96 percent.

<HEAD>Power Surge At Savannah River Reactor Remains Unexplained, Panel
Told</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unreviewed calculation flawed four
different ways led to the failed restart of a nuclear weapons
production reactor, an Energy Department advisory panel was told
Thursday.
   But no one knows why the same reactor at the Savannah River
Plant near Aiken, S.C., underwent a power surge a few days later,
after a successful restart, the panel was told.
   It was discovery of a flawed calculation decades ago that led
the department earlier this year to order its remaining weapons
reactors limited to half power. A runaway power surge with safety
systems disconnected caused the 1986 Chernobyl reactor explosion in
the Soviet Union.
   Department officials have said their concern was not so much the
two abnormal restart events in themselves, but delays in being told
about them by the operating contractor, the Du Pont Co.
   Du Pont reported the Aug. 10 power surge only in the next day's
routine operations report despite assuring the department on Aug. 9
it would be quicker to report unusual events.
   The series of events at Savannah River's P-Reactor was described
in a report to the department's new Advisory Committee on Nuclear
Facility Safety by a subcommittee headed by Elmer Schwartz,
associate dean of engineering at the University of South Carolina.
   Richard Starostecki, deputy assistant secretary for environment,
safety and health, told reporters that new communications
agreements had been reached between Du Pont and the department, but
the reactor in question was shut down Aug. 17 and would remain
closed until investigators discover why power surged by 2 percent
without explanation.
   When the power surge occured, the reactor was 90 percent of the
way to its planned half-power operating level.
   ``You aren't supposed to have any power surges,'' Starostecki
said.
   The committee also was given an analysis of the events of Aug.
8-Aug. 17 done for Schwartz by Dana A. Powers of the Sandia
National Laboratory in New Mexico.
   Powers' report said the surge was ``miniscule'' and though rare
had happened before. It was quickly corrected by the operators.
Schwartz said it was well within the trigger point that would have
led to an automatic shutdown.
   The three reactors at Savannah River produce no electricity.
Neutrons produced in the nuclear reactions of uranium make either
plutonium or tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen, for nuclear
weapons.
   All three reactors were shut for various reasons when the
department decided to finish a tritium production run in the
P-Reactor after a 119-day shutdown. This was the longest idle
period the reactor had ever undergone with a fuel core in place.
   The flawed calculation of the expected strength of the nuclear
reactions on startup was used to position the neutron-absorbing
control rods, according to Powers' report. The reactor becamed
self-sustaining only when the rods where withdrawn far more than
the calculation said they should have been, and self-sustaining
operation could not be maintained.
   The department admitted earlier that the calculation had ignored
the buildup of helium in the reactor from decay of tritium during
the long shutdown. Helium tends to ``poison'' or suppress the
nuclear reaction.
   Powers pinpointed three other flaws in the calculation he said
no one reviewed.
   _The actual history of the fuel was not used in the calculation.
The analyst in question used the out-of-date planned use of the
fuel. ``Oversight or not, this is a less readily excused error''
than neglecting helium.
   _The presence in the fuel of samarium, a metallic element in the
rare-earths group, was not sufficiently accounted for.
   _Three control rods that couldn't be raised were left out of the
calculation.
   ``There appears to be no Department of energy standards on the
nature of operational readiness reviews,'' Powers said.
   Since the shutdown had been the longest ever, ``It is surprising
then that no Department of Energy personnel were present for this
restart. What kind of oversight is it that does not follow unusual
events during this period of enhanced scrutiny of the production
reactors?'' he said.
   Powers said he found no evidence that ``desire for production at
the expense of safety'' prompted the restart and in fact a fresh
fuel charge would have optimized production after the long shutdown.

<HEAD>Showers Along the East Coast As Seasonably Mild Weather Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Most of the nation enjoyed pleasant weather in the 70s and 80s
Tuesday, but showers and a few thunderstorms were scattered along
the southern Atlantic coast and in parts of Texas and Colorado.
   In the East, rain fell along a cold front stretching from the
Carolinas to the Gulf Coast, with thunderstorms along the North
Carolina coast and in west-central and southeast Georgia and
northeast Florida.
   More than a quarter-inch of rain fell at the Naval Air Station
near Key West, Fla., and at Bluefield, W.Va., in the six hours
ended at 2 p.m. EDT.
   Showers and isolated thunderstorms also developed over
west-central Texas and in central Colorado. With thunderstorms
expected once again over the mountain and desert areas of Southern
California, the National Weather Service posted a flash flood watch
for the area until evening.
   Farther north, light rain showers moved from eastern Iowa across
southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois.
   Temperatures were seasonably mild, in the 70s and 80s across
much of the country, though lower in the northern Great Lakes
region and parts of New England and in the Pacific Northwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55
degrees at Arcata, Calif., to 103 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.
The low in the nation Tueday morning was 32 degrees at Jackson, Wyo.
   For Wednesday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from the southern Atlantic states across Florida and the Gulf
Coast. Showers and thunderstorms were expected to develop in the
afternoon west of the southern Rockies, across the mountains and
into western Texas, as well as over eastern Minnesota and northwest
Wisconsin.
   Temperatures were expected to be higher than Tuesday's _ in the
80s or 90s across much of the nation, but in the 70s from the upper
Great Lakes through the upper Ohio Valley and central Appalachians
into New England and between 100 and 110 in the desert Southwest.

   A U.S. Army M1 tank accidentally
fired practice rounds at two Bradley armored personnel carriers
during a night training exercise, killing an American soldier and
wounding four, the Army said Tuesday.
   The accident occurred Monday night at a practice range in
Grafenwoehr, about 125 miles north of Munich, the Army's 5th Corps
said in a statement.
   ``Two of the Bradley fighting machines were accidently struck by
firing from an M1'' and one of the Bradleys caught fire, the
statement said.
   It said two of the wounded soldiers were in satisfactory
condition in a Nuremberg hospital, being treated for burns, and
``the two other soldiers were treated at the Grafenwoehr dispensary
and released.''
   The Army did not identify the soldiers.

   Two Soviet MiG-29s did some
impromptu aerobatics Tuesday as they arrived for their first public
performance in the West at next week's Farnborough air show.
   Two British Tornado F3s met the newest Soviet fighters 100 miles
out and escorted them from the North Sea to Farnborough in tight
formation. The Tornados peeled off to let the Soviets put on a
brief show before landing.
   British and Soviet crews greeted each other on the ground with
smiles, handshakes and pledges that safety would come first after
Sunday's air show disaster at the U.S. Air Force base at Ramstein,
West Germany.
   ``We consider safety to be the most important aspect of all,''
said Anatoly Kvotchur, chief test pilot for MiG-29 manufacturer
Mikoyan and the first Soviet to land.
   Wing Commander Euan Black, 42, who welcomed the Soviet fighters
in his Tornado jet, agreed that safety was paramount.
   The Soviets have shown the MiG-29 privately in Finland but its
public debut in the West will be at Farnborough. Moscow hopes its
twin-tailed, twin-engined fighter will impress the hundreds of
international arms buyers at the week-long exhibition, the most
important on this year's international aerospace calendar.

   A car bomb exploded Tuesday in Chtoura, a
Syrian-controlled market town in east Lebanon, killing a 7-year-old
boy and wounding seven other children aged 3 to 8, police said
reported.
   The white Volvo exploded at 1 p.m. near a bank office on the
Beirut-Damascus road, the main route used by the Syrian army to
supply its forces in Lebanon.
   No one claimed responsibility for Lebanon's the 12th car bomb of
the year. By police count, the earlier bombings killed 103 people
and wounded 371.
   Police said the children were playing behind a tree when 44
pounds of TNT inside the car detonated. The explosion broke windows
in shops and apartment buildings and five other parked cars ablaze.
   Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon and keeps 40,000
soldiers in east Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, north Lebanon and in
Moslem west Beirut.
   Tuesday's explosion appeared to be one of several in the past
two weeks aimed at discrediting Syria's peacekeeping role while
Lebanon chooses a new president. At least nine explosive charges
have gone off near Syrian army checkpoints in west Beirut, causing
damage but no casualties.
   President Amin Gemayel's six-year term expires Sept. 23 and he
cannot seek a new term. Parliament was to elect a new president
Aug. 18, but the election was postponed for lack of a quorum and no
new date was set.
   The deadlock caused political turmoil and threatened to rekindle
a 13-year-old sectarian civil war that has been largely dormant for
the past 18 months.

   President Jose Napoleon Duarte,
convalescing from cancer, resumed his duties Tuesday and received
the credentials of the new U.S. ambassador.
   Duarte looked gaunt and tired as he posed briefly for
photographers with Ambassador William Walker. He made no comment to
journalists and spent 10 minutes with Walker, who replaces Edwin
Corr.
   The 62-year-old president, who has incurable liver cancer, has
had two week-long chemotherapy sessions at Johns Hopkins Hospital
in Washington since the diagnosis in June. He has lost 35 pounds
this month and has been in bed since returning Aug. 10.
   A week after returning, he took a turn for the worse because of
complications caused by diabetes but his doctors and government
spokesmen have said the crisis was overcome.
   When the cancer was diagnosed, Duarte's doctors gave him between
six and 18 months to live. His presidential term ends June 1, 1989.
   Foreign Minister Ricardo Acevedo Peralta told journalists
outside the palace Duarte was ``in good spirits'' but also ``weak,
naturally.''
   He said the president will gauge how much work he can handle and
try to make a manageable schedule.

   Four Americans who suffered severe
burns but survived the Ramstein air show disaster left for Texas
Tuesday aboard a special U.S. Air Force transport plane.
   ``These are the most badly burned Americans survivors able to be
moved,'' said Maj. Kathy White, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Air
Force base at Ramstein. They were the first American victims of
Sunday's tragedy evacuated to the United States.
   The Air Force said three were soldiers and the fourth was a
woman ``dependent of an American serviceman.''
   It identified the soldiers as Air Force Master Sgt. Stephen
Hull, 32; Army 1st Lt. Kim Strader, 30; and Army Pfc. Myron Riggs,
24, and the woman only as Anderea Delarosa. No hometowns were given.
   Surgeons and other medical personnel clad in blue and yellow
surgical gowns and wearing masks took nearly an hour to move the
four victims from a military ambulance onto a giant C-141 transport.
   ``The C-141 is a heavy transport plane especially adapted for
medical evacuations,'' Maj. White said.
   It left at about 7 p.m. (1 p.m. EDT) on the 13-hour flight to
the Brook Army Medical Center at San Antonio, Texas, which
specializes in treating burn injuries.
   The patients, with intravenous bottles held over them, were
covered with blankets as they were carried aboard the plane on
stretchers.
   Reporters and television crews were kept at a distance and Air
Force guards ringed the aircraft. Medical edquipment was loaded
aboard the plane.
   A five-member medical team flown from San Antonio to Ramstein on
Monday night accompanied the victims and five other medical
personnel were on the aircraft, including two doctors.
   The four victims were brought from the U.S. Army's Landstuhl
hospital, about 2{ miles from the air base. They arrived in a blue
Air Force bus, converted into a stretcher carrier, with a police
escort.

<TEXT>
   Soldiers fatally shot three
armed men in a car Tuesday, a few miles from the spot where an
Irish Republican Army bomb killed eight soldiers on a bus and
injured 27 others.
   The IRA's legal political wing Sinn Fein issued a statement
saying the dead were IRA members, Brian Mullen and brothers Gerard
and Martin Harte.
   Mullen was a brother of one of eight men held for questioning
following the Aug. 20 bus bombing. All those questioned were
released without charge on Monday.
   The shooting in Omagh, 50 miles west of Belfast, was seen as
part of a stepped-up British response to the IRA's summer campaign
against the army and police, which has killed 27 members of the
security forces and triggered a wave of outrage in Britain and in
the province.
   Also Tuesday, two buses and a van were hijacked and set afire in
Roman Catholic west Belfast, but no casualties were reported. Four
mortar bombs and 25 pounds of explosives were found aboard a bus
crossing the border from the Republic of Ireland, said police in
Londonderry.
   A police spokesman said two rifles were recovered at the scene
of the shooting that took place at about 4 p.m. (11 a.m. EDT).
   ``The incident occurred when soldiers encountered armed men in a
vehicle and opened fire,'' he said. He said officials had not yet
identified the three bodies. He released no further details.
   A British army spokesman, unidentified in keeping with British
practice, said security forces sealed off roads leading into the
surrounding area where the three men were slain as police gathered
forensic evidence.
   Press Association, the British domestic news agency, quoting
unidentified military sources, said the SAS, the elite Special Air
Services regiment, was involved in the shooting. The army said its
policy prohibits confirming whether soldiers of the SAS took part.
   Local residents reported seeing a military helicopter pick up
four men in civilian clothes and whisk them away minutes after the
shooting.
   A man and a woman claiming to be a brother and sister of two of
the dead men, drove up to the police cordon and the man shouted at
the officers: ``They were gunned down by dogs _ they were set up by
the SAS!''
   The women added: ``They may have gunned down three, but a lot
more will go for them!''
   The police spokesman said Tuesday's shootings occurred on the
main road from Omagh to Carrickmore, a few miles away from the site
of the Aug. 20 bombing which exploded near the British army bus.
   The bus bomb dealt the army in Northern Ireland its worst blow
since 1982, and brought to 26 the military death toll in a summer
of IRA attacks in Ulster, mainland Britain and continental Europe.
   The outlawed IRA is fighting to end British rule in
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and unite the province with
the Irish Republic, which is predominantly Roman Catholic.
   The bombs and Czechoslovakian-made Semtex explosives discovered
earlier Tuesday were on a bus owned by the Lough Swilly Co., a
private bus service, when it was stopped and searched at a border
checkpoint, a police spokesman said.
   They were found in luggage in the passenger compartment, said
the spokesman, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said the bus driver and passengers were being questioned but
no arrests were made.
   The discovery followed a weekend of bombings, shootings, riots
and other violence in Belfast, Londonderry and Newry that was
sparked by the extradition from Ireland to Northern Ireland of a
convicted guerrilla and jail escapee.
   The IRA led the violent protests over Robert Russell's
extradition, police said.
   Security forces in Northern Ireland have said the IRA received
Semtex, a lightweight and difficult to detect explosive, in arms
shipments from Libya. Britain has held discussions with
Czechoslovakia about making it more difficult for the IRA to obtain
Semtex.

<HEAD>US Businessman, Ghanaians Charged as Parrot Smugglers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ACCRA, Ghana (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American businessman Darrell Marion
Alexander and two Ghanaians have pleaded innocent to charges of
trying to export 2,000 African gray parrots to the United States
illegally.
   Alexander, identified as managing director of Exotic Fauna
International, and Ghanaian wildlife exporters Christian Leslie
Mills and Wabi Bello were held over for court appearances Wednesday.
   They entered pleas Monday before a national public tribunal
where each faced a 25-count charge, including ``acts detrimental to
the welfare of the sovereign people of Ghana.''
   A month ago, the Record newspaper of Lompoc, Calif., quoted
relatives as saying Alexander, 46, of the Los Angeles suburb of La
Crescenta, went to Ghana in November and got all the necessary
permits for exporting the gray parrots.
   They said Exotic Fauna International is a bird import company
based in Los Angeles and sanctioned by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, the paper reported.
   ``We consider him a hostage, not a criminal,'' Alexander's
nephew Mark, a resident of Lompoc, was quoted as saying.
   At the Democratic National Convention July 19 in Atlanta, about
a dozen onlookers and reporters watched when Darrell Alexander's
family took the podium to urge that he be released from jail in
Ghana.
   Ghanaian authorities said June 13 that Alexander and another
American were arrested after Lt. Cmdr. K. Assassie-Gyimah, a senior
government official, discovered the birds squawking in an airplane
hold. The other American was not identified and was neither
mentioned nor present at the court proceeding Monday.
   Exporting African gray parrots from Ghana is illegal.
   The gpverment accuses Alexander of paying more than 6 million
cedis ($200,000) to the Ghanaians, who are accused of bribing
officials for phony export permits.
   The African gray parrot, once common in West African forests, is
noted for its ability to learn to talk quickly. Excessive trapping
of the birds and destruction of their habitat have made them scarce.
   Alexander's brother Alvin of Las Vegas, Nev., was quoted by the
Lompoc paper as saying he visited the military compound in Ghana
where his brother was held and found prisoners ``chained together
and beaten with hoses, and they sleep in cells with dirt floors.''
   The State Department in Washington said that consular officials
visited Darrell Alexander many times and found him to be all right.

   Florala Mayor H.T. Mathis, accused of
embarrassing his town with ``voodoo'' antics, testified Tuesday
that he granted pardons to convicted offenders because he has a
soft heart.
   ``My mission on Earth is to help people,'' the 85-year-old
former tire store owner testified as the defense began presenting
its case at his impeachment trial for alleged incompetence and
misuse of office.
   Before taking the stand, he told reporters: ``Satan is trying to
destroy Florala's government. I love Florala.''
   Prosecution witnesses depicted Mathis as a man who undermined
the law by abusing his pardon power. He is accused of pardoning
more than 100 traffic offenders, including 27 drunken drivers.
   ``I have more power than Ronald Reagan,'' Mathis was quoted as
saying by City Clerk Betty Hooten, the final prosecution witness.
   In Alabama, removal from office is decided by a civil proceeding
conducted much like a criminal trial. Covington County Circuit
Judge William Baldwin will send the case to the jury Wednesday
morning.
   In closing arguments, Mathis' attorney, James Prestwood, said it
would be cruel to impeach Mathis.
   ``Why go to all this expense?'' Prestwood said. ``They've done
everything in the book to make H.T. Mathis look bad.''
   But Attorney General Don Siegelman described the situation in
Florala as ``the most abusive case I've ever heard of in the United
States.'' He said the impeachment complaint was brought ``to
prevent a tragedy'' such as a highway death caused by a drunken
driver who had been pardoned ``at the whim of a mayor.''
   Mrs. Hooten said she told the mayor some of the offenders
getting pardoned had been highly intoxicated. Asked his reaction,
she said, ``It didn't seem like it mattered to him.''
   Questioned by prosecutors about the pardons, Mathis said people
came to him with sad stories and he was just trying to help them.
   ``I'm just a little soft-hearted,'' he said.
   In earlier testimony Tuesday, witnesses told the jury that
Mathis once threatened a councilman with a knife and asked the
police chief to give him confiscated wine.
   The mayor of Florala, a town of about 5,000 on the Florida line
20 miles south of Andalusia, was charged with corruption,
incompetence and willful neglect of duty by the grand jury that
called for his ouster.
   Mathis' critics also deplored his July proclamation of
``National Voodoo Week'' and his earlier purported attempt to scare
the police chief by sprinkling so-called ``voodoo powder'' around
City Hall, council chambers and down corridors to the jail.
   In his testimony, the mayor elaborated on the caper.
   Mathis said he did not believe in voodoo and the yellow powder
he spread at City Hall was sulfur powder not meant to harm anyone.
After the incident was reported by the media, the mayor said he
decided to capitalize on publicity.
   ``I don't even know what voodoo means. ... I made a mistake in
the way I did it,'' he testified.
   Police Chief A.V. Patrick testified Tuesday that he was not
influenced by the mayor's voodoo joke. Patrick, however, said the
mayor's abuse of pardoning power turned Florala law enforcement
into a joke.
   He said arrested motorists would laugh at officers and one told
him: ``I don't mind you arresting me. I'm going to get a pardon.''
   The mayor's attorney tried to show Tuesday that the pardons
granted by Mathis demonstrated his concern about the cost of
housing people in the city jail and his belief that it was better
for them to be working, earning an income.
   Mathis defended his performance in office over the last four
years, citing annual increases in the city's sales tax collection
from $850,152 in 1984 to last year's $930,365.
   In her testimony, Mrs. Hooten said the pardons granted by
Mathis, who was elected in 1984, cost the city $27,767 in canceled
or refunded fines. She said the mayor told her he didn't think some
of the arrested offenders were guilty.
   Mathis' term expires Oct. 3. But Florala's city election has
been postponed by a federal court, and the mayor, barring removal
through impeachment, could hold the office for an indefinite period
as a result.

<HEAD>Fairly Moderate Quake Motion Could Damage Protective System</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fairly moderate earthquake ground motion could
damage a major protective system of the Energy Department's
P-Reactor at the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina, a
department official said Tuesday.
   But major reactor components could withstand larger quakes,
according to a report by Richard Starostecki, deputy assistant
secretary for environment, safety and health to the department's
new Advisory Committee on Nuclear Facility Safety
   The department plans to operate the P-Reactor for another year
before beginning a major upgrade of its protection against
earthquakes.
   Starostecki presented DOE's first numerical estimates of the
ability of major systems of the reactor to come through earthquakes
and still function. Studies aimed at similar estimates are under
way for the two other nuclear weapons material production reactors
at the Savannah River Plant.
   Ground acceleration of about 1 foot per second per second would
be enough to harm the filtration system designed to remove
radioactive particles from air escaping from the reactor building
in a major accident, Starostecki said.
   In this ``confinement'' system, ``the limiting areas ... are
primarily the filters'' _ and at that acceleration, there is doubt
``that you can keep them up against the ductwork.''
   Beyond about 3.2 feet per second per second, ``you probably
don't have confinement capability,'' Starostecki said.
   One foot per second per second is about 3 percent of the
acceleration that gravity imparts to a freely falling object, about
32 feet per second per second.
   The acceleration due to gravity is called ``g,'' and engineers
frequently express other accelerations as a fraction of ``g'' _ 16
feet per second per second is 0.5g, 1 foot per second per second is
0.03g, and so forth.
   People in a car accelerating steadily to 60 miles per hour in 15
second undergo an acceleration of a little less than 6 feet per
second per second or 0.18g.
   There is no necessary connection between ground acceleration and
earthquake severity, said Ken Campbell, a civil engineer in the
Boulder, Colo., office of the U.S. Geological Survey.
Destructiveness ``is a function of duration of the shaking and its
frequency content,'' as well as local geology, he said.
   Campbell estimated that the 1886 earthquake centered 19 miles
west of Charleston, S.C., caused ground accelerations of about 0.5g
over the center of the earthquake, which has been estimated at 6.8
to 7.2 on the Richter scale.
   Acceleration in the 1886 earthquake probably would have been
less than 0.1g about 200 miles away, he said. Savannah River is
about 115 miles northwest of Charleston.
   According to Starostecki's report, ground accelerations of 0.1g
could disable the emergency cooling system. At 0.2g ability to shut
down the reactor and remove its decay heat could be jeopardized.
   Each year, there is a 1 per cent to 2 percent chance of an
earthquake large enough to produce ground accelerations of 0.05g to
0.1g at Savannah River, said John Knight of Starostecki's office.
The chance of accelerations of 0.2g is about one in a thousand.
   ``As I see it, there is a crying need to sit back and say what
are the seismic criteria for the site _ no pun intended _ from the
ground up,'' Knight said. ``Keep in mind these systems were never
subjected to a seismic analysis.''
   Civilian reactors must be able to shut down in earthquakes of
varying severity, with standards tailored to individual sites.
   Frank Ingraham of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said the
most lenient is the site for the Yankee Rowe plant in
Massachusetts, where shutdown must be possible in ground motions of
0.05g. The strictest is the Diablo Canyon site in California, close
to a major fault, where shutdown must be possible in motions of
0.75g.

   Eastern Airlines' labor leaders embraced a federal
judge's ruling Tuesday that blocked layoffs of 4,000 employees,
although it allows the company to go ahead with service cutbacks.
   ``We're please at this ruling. It will save 4,000 jobs (and it
rules that) the proposed furloughing is illegal,'' said Charles E.
Bryan, president of District 100 of the Machinists union, Eastern's
largest with 12,000 workers.
   Bryan, flight attendants' leader Mary Jane Barry and pilots
local vice chairman Dan Vician talked to reporters at the Transport
Workers Union hall just off the Miami International Airport as
their attorneys studied the 50-page opinion by U.S. District Judge
Barrington Parker in Washington.
   Eastern, while satisfied that Parker will allow the closing of
its Kansas City hub and the elimination of 140 flights, said it
will appeal his decision that the company cannot make mass layoffs
without bargaining with its unions.
   Bryan called the decision ``an opportunity'' for Texas Air Corp.
Chairman Frank Lorenzo to show he is more than ``the No. 1
union-buster.''
   ``Here now is a chance for him to change his style. The ball is
in Frank Lorenzo's court,'' Bryan said.
   He and the other union leaders expressed willingness to meet
with management to discuss cost-cutting measures that preserve jobs.
   ``We're not here as laborers trying to direct the business of
the airline. We're trying to protect jobs,'' Vician said.
   Ms. Barry said the flight attendants were still willing to offer
a job-sharing and leave plan, rejected earlier by management, to
save jobs and money.
   Eastern spokeswoman Paula Musto said she couldn't comment on the
unions' interpretation of the opinion.
   The union leaders stressed Parker's findings of fact that Texas
Air, which took over Miami-based Eastern two years ago, has been
antagonistic toward unions, tried to spin off assets such as the
Northeast shuttle service and has worsened Eastern's financial
problems by using Eastern resources to pay for its own sale, taking
a non-interest $16 million note from Eastern and taking a $6
million annual management fee from Eastern.
   ``In short, the record shows that Eastern has served as a
lending institution to meet the needs of Texas Air and Continental
(the non-union carrier also owned by Houston-based Texas Air),''
the opinion said.
   ``It confirmed what we've been saying,'' Bryan said. ``This is a
federal judge. It's not the unions anymore or our consultants
talking.''
   Eastern is cutting 140 flights and service from 14 cities, while
reducing its Kansas City hub from 53 to six flights and non-hub
status. Ms. Musto said the company hasn't determined what it will
do with the protected employees.

<TEXT>
   Panama was among the 30 nations that
participated in a U.S.-backed drug crackdown, even though the
United States brought economic sanctions against the country
because of drug charges against its military leader.
   Colombian narcotics officials, meanwhile, were skeptical about
the success of the joint drug crackdown. They said no major
traffickers were arrested in the operations from Aug. 1-28 and the
amounts of drugs seized were not impressive.
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency had encouraged the 30 countries
to step up enforcement and specifically to cooperate in
cross-border raids, mostly in South America, during August.
   DEA head John C. Lawn praised the anti-drug campaign and said it
showed that international cooperation could eliminate sanctuaries
for drug traffickers who tried to evade capture by going to other
countries.
   Lawn and other representatives made brief statements during a
meeting with reporters, but journalists were not allowed to ask
questions.
   The Bogota meeting coincided with a report in Washington on the
results of the operations by the International Drug Enforcement
Conference.
   U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh said in Washington that
the raids led to more than 1,200 arrests, the seizure of 11 tons of
cocaine and the destruction of 244 tons of marijuana, 118,000 coca
plants and 13 cocaine laboratories.
   The Panamanian delegate to the Bogota meeting, Lt. Col. Nivaldo
Madrinan, said in his statement that Panama participated in the
program even though it is ``suffering the greatest aggression in
its history.'' He did not specifically mention the U.S. sanctions.
   Panama's military leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, was
indicted in February by two federal grand juries in Florida that
accused him of drug trafficking. The United States imposed economic
sanctions against Panama after Noriega refused to resign and leave
the country.
   Noriega, commander of Panama's Defense Forces, controls the
civilian government.
   Madrinan said the month-long drug crackdown in Panama produced
96 arrests and the seizure of 4.8 pounds of cocaine, $2,084, eight
vehicles and eight weapons.
   Reporters were now allowed to ask who had been arrested.
   Panama, Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela sent
delegates to the Bogota meeting.
   Colombian officials, speaking with the condition they not be
identified, noted the DEA reported the raids turned up 13 cocaine
laboratories and they said more than 13 labs are frequently found
in a single week in Colombia.
   The DEA report said that of the 11 tons of cocaine and cocaine
base seized, 6.2 tons were found in South American countries. The
Colombian officials said that in one raid in Colombia five years
ago more than 10 tons of cocaine and cocaine base were seized.
   The Colombians also questioned a section of the DEA statement
that said the raids were the result of cooperation among the
participating countries.
   They said cross-border operations between Venezuela and Colombia
were a week late because of border disputes and claimed Venezuela
did virtually nothing during the campaign.

   A twin-engine airplane approaching the
Toledo Express Airport crashed into a neighborhood Tuesday,
injuring four people and knocking down power lines, authorities
said.
   The plane, carrying three people, crashed at 12:40 p.m. in a
yard at the home of Esther and Sam Burton, officials said.
   Burton, who was working in the yard, suffered minor injuries.
Two of those aboard the plane were hospitalized in serious
condition; the other was treated and released, officials said.
   Part of the plane got caught in a tree. Power lines were downed,
knocking out electricity to some 2,300 homes for about an hour.
   Airport officials said the pilot was training two student fliers
when one of the plane's engines stopped during a maneuver.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on
Tuesday allowed the government to begin enforcing a new law banning
sexually obscene dial-a-porn message services, pending the full
court's review of the statute.
   O'Connor denied a request by Sable Communications of California
Inc. for a stay of a Los Angeles federal court ruling that upheld
that portion of the law banning telephone services whose messages
fall under the legal definition of ``obscene.''
   The California court, however, also ruled that federal
regulators may not ban ``indecent'' messages from phone lines. The
government has appealed that decision and both portions of the law
are now before the Supreme Court.
   The justice's denial of a stay means the government ban on
obscene telephone messages is in effect and the Federal
Communications Commission will begin enforcing it, said Diane
Killory, FCC general counsel.
   ``I don't see any basis for us to hold up enforcement,'' she
said.
   Sable attorney Richard Simon said he was not surprised by
O'Connor's action, but said, ``I think we can make a very
convincing case that the statute as written is unconstitiuional and
we expect to do that.''
   The FCC considers material ``indecent'' if it depicts or
describes sexual or excretory organs or activities in a patently
offensive way.
   The commission deems material ``obscene'' if it depicts sexual
acts in a patently offensive way, appeals to the prurient interest
of an average person and lacks serious literary, artistic,
political or scientific value.
   The law applies only to interstate dial-a-porn calls and those
in the District of Columbia. It provides for both criminal and
civil prosecution and carries penalties of up to $50,000 for each
day of violation and imprisonment of up to six months.
   The law had been scheduled to take effect July 1, but Sable's
lawsuit challenge and another separate lawsuit filed in New York
delayed enforcement.

   NASA's most ambitious scientific project,
putting the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope into orbit, is
being delayed by seven months because of postponements in the
flight of Discovery, the space agency said Tuesday.
   Discovery's mission, the first since the Challenger exploded in
1986, has been postponed five times. NASA is hedging on a new date,
but said it hopes to begin the flight in late September or early
October.
   The space telescope was scheduled for launch June 1 next year
from Discovery. Instead, it has been moved to Feb. 1, 1990.
   The revised payload schedule, NASA said, will enable it to
launch three major scientific probes: Magellan, a probe to map the
planet Venus, in April 1989; Galileo, a cooperative project with
Germany to survey Jupiter and its moons, scheduled for October
1989; and Ulysses, a cooperative project with the European Space
Agency, in October 1990.

   An amateur photographer took
still photos of the deadly crash at Ramstein during the weekend,
but the pictures were not publicized until Tuesday, after they were
discovered by a developing lab.
   Georg Riedel had a 135mm lens on his camera when the accident
occurred Sunday at the U.S. Air Base in Ramstein, said Max Simon,
photo editor at the Frankfurt bureau of The Associated Press.
   ``He said he just went there for fun,'' said Simon.
   Three Italian jets collided during a stunt show at the base and
one of them crashed into spectators, killing at least 49 people and
injuring hundreds, officials said.
   After the accident Riedel, a government employee who lives in
Karlsruhe, drove home and went to sleep, Simon quoted him as saying.
   ``On Monday he went to a color lab to have the pictures
developed,'' Simon said. ``The woman working at the lab saw how
dramatic the pictures were.''
   Simon said the woman knew the AP stringer for the area and
contacted him.
   ``The stringer then tracked Riedel down, but it took him awhile
to get in touch with him,'' Simon said.

   A large inner-city hospital and a tiny rural one
Tuesday joined the growing number of community hospitals across the
nation forced to close their doors because they can't make ends
meet.
   St. Anne's Hospital, which has 437 beds, is the 10th community
hospital in Chicago to shut down since 1986, officials said. It
will close its doors within a few weeks after 85 years of service
to the West Side, said spokeswoman Candace Hulsebus-Fong.
   White Hall Hospital, an acute-care facility with 30 beds in
southwestern Illinois, is the sixth small rural hospital to shut
down in the state since 1986, said Kenneth Robbins, president of
the Illinois Hospital Association.
   ``The fact that both of them were forced to close was no
coincidence at all, but the result of conscious decisions of
federal and state governments to underfund the Medicare and
Medicaid programs that pay for health care for the elderly and the
poor,'' Robbins said.
   In 1987, a record 79 community hospitals shut down across the
nation, five of them in Illinois, said Jan Shulman, a spokeswoman
for the American Hospital Asssociation.
   St. Anne's officials said the hospital has suffered from late
and inadequate federal reimbursement for its service to poor
patients.
   Illinois' Medicaid program, strapped for funds itself, owes the
hospital $1.7 million, they said.
   In April, St. Anne's laid off 60 percent of its staff to meet
expenses. Since then, it has used only 115 of its beds.
   About 80 percent of St. Anne's patients rely on Medicaid or
Medicare to pay their bills, Ms. Hulsebus-Fong said.
   ``Another 10 percent of those are indigent, so less than 10
percent have any kind of commercial insurance,'' she said.
   All but about 15 percent of White Hall's patients relied on
Medicaid or Medicare, said Glenn Klein, the hospital's
administrator.
   ``Our board just could not justify maintaining an operation that
lost money every single day of the week,'' he said.

   A California brush fire destroyed at least five homes while
crews fighting forest fires gained ground Tuesday in Yellowstone
National Park and the Forest Service went to employment offices in
the West in search of more firefighters.
   National Guardsmen in Idaho were sent to the firelines, and
Wyoming Guard volunteers were sent for fire training.
   Firefighters were at work against fires charring woodland in
Wyoming, California, Montana, Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Utah.
And dozens of fires have been allowed to smolder for months in the
vast interior of Alaska.
   Across the Bay from San Francisco in the grass- and
brush-covered Orinda hills, a fire burned out of control for two
hours Tuesday afternoon in an exclusive section of Orinda.
   Five houses were ``totaled'' and two others had an undetermined
amount of damage from flames still burning late Tuesday after the
blaze was largely contained, Fire Chief Ed Lucas said.
   ``The hills are steep, and when the wind comes up, it makes
those hills like chimneys with flames just coming right up them,''
said Nancy Artist. She said the fire came within yards of her home.
   Another remote California town mopped up after lightning-sparked
blazes swept within feet of the community and forced evacuation of
the town hospital for several hours.
   Nationally, 18,000 firefighters were on the job in one of the
nation's worst fire years, reported the Boise Interagency Fire
Center, a central office in Idaho that coordinates the fighting of
forest fires in the West.
   To date, 3.4 million acres of forest has burned, slightly ahead
of last year's pace, but 2.1 million of that total is in Alaska,
where 30 fires smoldered Tuesday, the center reported.
   The fire center told Forest Service regions affected by the
fires that temporary firefighters may be hired on a contingency
basis for about $7 an hour, said information officer Mike Ferris.
   Ferris said each national forest must determine its
requirements. ``We're not saying we're going to hire 4,000 or
8,000,'' he said.
   Applicants lined up at state employment offices in the affected
areas. ``We've got them hanging out our ears,'' said applicant
interviewer Dan Rummel of Missoula, Mont.
   Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus placed his entire state under an extreme
fire emergency Monday, releasing National Guardsmen to reinforce
firefighters. Wyoming Gov. Mike Sullivan authorized committing 120
Army and Air National Guard volunteers to the effort, after they
were given 32 hours of training.
   Firefighters in Yellowstone National Park regained ground they
lost last week against one of the tougher fires blazing in the
park, sealing off the popular Old Faithful geyser from flames 5
miles away.
   Continued low wind in the country's oldest national park on
Monday allowed firefighters there to make further inroads against
the fires, which have charred some 450,000 acres of the
2.2-million-acre park.
   That calm weather had prompted a decision to reopen
Yellowstone's south entrance for the frst time in 10 days, but
spokeswoman Amy Vanderbilt said fire activity put the area back in
danger. The road had been closed for 10 days.
   In California's Sierra Nevada, firefighters late Monday kept
fast-moving lightning fires from reaching a hospital, school and
other buildings in remote Portola. There were no injuries in the
town of 1,600 residents, and the only building lost was a barn.
   ``It burned trees right up to the high school lawn,'' said
Highway Patrol officer Rod McCurley.
   About 30 patients and staff were evacuated from the Eastern
Plumas District Hospital for 5{ hours, while deputies, the local
search and rescue team and volunteers helped state firefighters
halt the blaze.
   ``It was amazing. People came from all over to help save our
homes _ people I never saw before,'' said Joann Cavarg, 41. ``I was
raised in New York. I never knew what it was like before to live in
a small town were everybody cared about everybody else.''
   The Combination fire in southwestern Montana made no gains
overnight beyond the 11,200 acres it has burned between Philipsburg
and Drummond, said fire information officer Palmer Bowen. It has
burned a mining camp and threatened the small community of
Maxville. Bowen said it was 85 percent contained Tuesday.
   In the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness north of Yellowstone
National Park, fire officials predicted the 40,300-acre Storm Creek
fire and the 34,200-acre Hellroaring Creek fire would eventually
meet, said Nick Tafoya, information officer.
   A fire crew bus careened off an embankment in northeastern
Washington late Monday while returning 16 firefighters to the
Colville Indian Reservation, and five were injured, authorities
said. Fires on the reservation and the neighboring Colville
National Forest have burned more than 22,500 acres.
   In Alaska, where some fires have been burning since April, the
biggest blaze had covered more than 541,000 acres 50 miles north of
Fairbanks. But the fires do not threaten any developed property or
valuable timber, and a special interagency office handling fire
information for the state has been disbanded for the season.

   An 8-foot alligator is a full day's work,
Dale Dunaway reckons.
   First he plunges his hunting knife through the gator's thick
hide at the tip of its tail. Then it's a slow and difficult cut to
the snout.
   ``You got to look at it as an hour a foot to properly skin and
gut a gator,'' Dunaway, who operates one of Florida's few alligator
processing facilities, said Tuesday. ``There's no way around it.
It's hard work, you bet.''
   At the Gator House in the remote southwest Florida grasslands,
Dunaway and his relatives have sharpened their knives and readied
the pots in anticipation of the first statewide gator hunt since
the 37-year-old Dunaway was a boy spearing alligators at nearby
Lake Trafford.
   For 30 days beginning at sunset Thursday, 238 license holders
will be stalking areas of the state where the gator population is
extraordinarly high. The hunt, the first since 1962, is needed to
trim the numbers of the once-threatened alligator, which has
rebounded strongly since strict anti-poaching measures were
instituted in the early 1970s.
   The estimated 1 million alligators in Florida is nearly double
the 1975 population, said Allan Woodward, head of the alligator
research unit for the state Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission.
   With each permit holder allowed up to 15 gators, Dunaway is
prepared to easily exceed the 130 gators skinned at the plant since
it opened in 1986.
   ``We expect to be up non-stop from Thursday until about Monday,
either skinning or hunting,'' he said. ``We're gonna be looking at
a lot of dead gators.''
   Some of the veteran hunters will be permitted to use the
equipment at the gator house, a cement frame enclosed by screen
wire and decorated by a few deer antlers and empty beer cans. A few
junk cars rest nearby while the cicadas scream incessantly.
   But the novice trappers, randomly selected from 5,000
applications, will watch their catch be pried apart.
   Alligators are cut up the back to preserve the valuable hide
covering the belly and underarms, said Dunaway. The hide, which
sells for about $42 a foot to foreign manufacturers, is submerged
in a brine solution for about a week.
   The excess flesh is then scraped off and the skin is sun dried.
   ``And we bury the innards as far away as possible,'' said
Dunaway. ``They got a powerful smell, and if you ever cut open the
stomach you better start running.''
   The meat _ which Dunaway says makes a nice addition to spaghetti
sauce _ must be frozen within several hours after the alligator is
killed. One 12-foot gator bought to the plant in 1986 yielded 230
pounds of meat.
   ``You're fixing to eat gator for a long time with a catch like
that,'' said Dunaway's brother, Grant, 34.
   Yet the gator business is just a hobby for the Dunaways and
uncle William Busby, 36. All will take vacation time from their
jobs to process the gators.
   They say the best they can do charging a $30 fee and $2 a pound
is break even.
   ``We just like it out here with the gators,'' said Grant.
   With state officials publicizing that a 10-foot gator could net
$1,000 in meat and skin, Dale Dunaway wonders if greed rather than
adventure is motivating the new hunters.
   ``You got to laugh when you hear these people say they're going
to make money off this hunt,'' he said. ``They don't figure in the
time, expenses _ and don't forget the danger. I'd like to see some
people's faces the first time a gator takes a bite at their airboat.
   ``But if they want to catch 'em, then we'll skin 'em. We'll just
say, `Stack 'em up.'''
   He folded his knife in a triumphant clap.

   Riot police used water cannons,
birdshot and tear gas to disperse about 300 students who erected
street barricades and set them afire Tuesday to protest the
government of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   A television news program said said at least six protesters were
arrested and several were slightly wounded.
   It was the second day of violent demonstrations by students from
the University of Panama and adjacent Industrial Arts School.
   During Monday's demonstrations the students were protesting
shortages of school supplies. Witnesses said at least four
protesters suffered minor injuries when police dispersed the crowd
but no arrests were reported.
   Both the university and Industrial Arts School were closed
Tuesday and the demonstrators called for the resignation of
Noriega, who as commander of the Defense Forces controls Panama's
civilian government.
   On Tuesday, more than 50 riot police tried to clear the
barricaded streets in the capital's downtown university zone. As
the students retreated they built new barricades blocking traffic.
When police charged the protesters responded with rocks.
   Panama has severe economic prolems because of sanctions opposed
by the United States in an effort to force Noriega to resign and
leave the country.
   Noriega was indicted in February by two federal grand juries in
Florida that accused him of drug trafficking.
   The economic measures taken by Washington against Panama have
helped push the country's economy into the worst depression since
the 1930s.

<TEXT>
   Republican presidential nominee George
Bush on Tuesday called rival Michael Dukakis ``another liberal
governor coming out of nowhere'' and suggested the Democrat would
advocate unilateral cuts in U.S. defense muscle.
   The vice president, continuing on the strong defense themes he
has been sounding over the past few days, sought to depict Dukakis
as inexperienced and weak on defense.
   Bush toured a Bendix defense plant where fuel systems are made
for fighter planes, and was shown a replica of the carburetor used
in the World War II fighter plane he had flown in the Navy.
   ``This plant keeps the muscle of our defense strong,'' Bush told
a group of plant employees. He suggested that Dukakis favors
``unilateral cuts in the muscle of the defense of the United
States.''
   The vice president earlier told a $500-a-ticket fund-raiser
that, while he didn't ``want anything to do with tearing down''
Dukakis, ``We should not gamble America's future on another liberal
governor coming out of nowhere.'' That was a reference to former
President Carter.
   Later, Bush repeated his theme in a speech to an American Legion
Post at Fort Campbell, Ky.
   ``If he doesn't want to modernize his snowblower, that's his
concern,'' Bush said, referring to the 25-year-old snowblower that
Dukakis keeps at home as a sign of his frugality. ``But if he
doesn't modernize our weapons systems, that puts the national
security of the United States in considerable risk.''
   And he said he had ``no response, none'' to a new attack by
Dukakis accusing him of being a hypocrite who sat idly by during
the Iran-Contra scandal.
   In his North Carolina appearance, the vice president also warned
against complacency in dealing with the Soviets _ despite recent
moves by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev toward improved relations
with the United States.
   ``We cannot adopt a naive hope that just because Mr. Gorbachev
looks different and talks different, that there are fundamental
changes, because there aren't,'' he told the fund-raiser.
   And, in his speech at the Bendix plant, Bush said: ``I'm glad
there is change in the Soviet Union. But we better not let our
guard down.''
   The Republican nominee, speaking at a rally at North Carolina
Wesleyan College later in the day, praised his running mate,
Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, who has come under close media scrutiny
over allegations that he and his wealthy family pulled strings to
get him into the National Guard at the height of the Vietnam War.
   ``I'm proud of my running mate,'' Bush told several thousand
students. ``It's nice to have a running mate going in the same
general direction as I am ... We'll do just fine.''
   At the outdoor campus rally, Bush was flanked by stock car
driver Cale Yarborough, a resident of South Carolina, and
conservative North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms. ``All states will be
in safe hands with George Bush as president,'' Helms said.
   Bush, meanwhile, shed little light on the subject of
presidential debates, a touchy topic being negotiated in
Washington. Asked whether he would commit himself to more than two
debates, Bush said, ``There will be debates.''
   He also suggested that too many debates would be ``boring'' to
voters.
   The fund-raising brunch earlier in the day was held at the home
of Jack Laughery, president of Imasco, U.S.A., which owns the
Hardee's fast-food chain.
   Speaking to about 150 people outside the house, on a dreary,
rainy day, Bush conceded that Democrats held a solid voter
registration edge in North Carolina.
   ``You're talking to a guy who knows you can't win if you're
outnumbered. You need 51 percent,'' Bush said.
   The vice president said he was encouraged by recent ``polling
things'' showing him to be leading Dukakis.
   ``That's turned around now after our upbeat Republican
convention,'' Bush said.
   ``I think I am more clearly spelling out why I want to be
president,'' Bush said.

   An explosion early Wednesday
set off a fire and and caused extensive damage at an office
building used by major anti-apartheid organizations.
   Bricks and glass littered the street, and a few passers-by
reportedly suffered minor injuries.
   Police said they had no immediate indication of what caused the
explosion at Khotso House in downtown Johannesburg about 1:20 a.m.
(7:20 p.m. EDT Tuesday). The blast was heard throughout the area.
   The building serves as headquarters for the South African
Council of Churches and the Black Sash civil rights group, two of
the most prominent anti-apartheid organizations not yet affected by
government bans. Other church and human rights groups also have
offices in the building.
   The South African Press Association quoted witnesses as saying
two people, apparently night watchmen, were in the building at the
time of the explosion but escaped unhurt.
   The blast followed recent bombings of restaurants and other
civilian targets which authorities blamed on the outlawed African
National Congress guerrilla movement.
   Last year, a series of unsolved bombings and arson attacks on
offices of anti-apartheid groups and militant black labor unions
took place. Activists suggested these attacks were carried out by
right-wing vigilantes, either within or outside the security forces.
   Bans were imposed this year on 19 anti-apartheid organizations,
barring them from functioning.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Tuesday overturned
the nine-year sentence and most of the criminal convictions of
former Guam Gov. Ricardo Bordallo, who allegedly exchanged
political favors for payoffs.
   In a 3-0 decision, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said
four bribery-related convictions had to be reversed because the
federal crime of bribery applies only to state officials and Guam
is a territory, not a state.
   The court also reversed four extortion-related convictions
because the jury was not told that it must find Bordallo demanded
or otherwise induced the payoffs, totaling $79,600 in cash.
   The court ruled recently in another Guam case that extortion
does not cover payments that an official accepted without either a
request or an understanding that the donor would get benefits in
exchange. The ruling, if it stands, would entitle Bordallo to a
retrial on those charges.
   The court upheld Bordallo's two other convictions: tampering
with a witness, for asking a supporter to lie to the grand jury,
and a related charge of conspiracy to obstruct justice.
   But according to Bordallo's lawyer, the entire nine-year prison
sentence was for the extortion convictions. He was given suspended
sentences on the other charges.
   Bordallo, a Democrat elected in 1982, was indicted a few days
before the 1986 Democratic primary. He won the primary but was
defeated in November 1986 by Republican Joseph Ada. He has been
free on bail during his appeal.
   Prosecutors said Bordallo approved government contracts and
permits for various firms in exchange for payments, mostly
delivered to him in unmarked envelopes.
   The money was described by the donors as campaign contributions
or gifts, but never was reported by Bordallo in his campaign
statements, authorities said. He also was accused of approving a
$103,000 government contract for a company that agreed to hire his
campaign manager.

   About 15 whites were turned away
Tuesday from a civil service examination for police recruits that
was for blacks only, and some complained they were the victims of
reverse discrimination.
   The test was given to 620 black men and women who had signed up
to take the test at the Civic Auditorium. The whites, through a
mixup, had been told to be at the auditorium too. When they showed
up, they were turned away.
   City officials said the whites never should have been told they
could take the test.
   The city placed an advertisement this summer in The Florida
Times-Union seeking black applicants only for police recuits
because there were no blacks on the list of candidates eligible to
enter the police academy.
   A total of 175 whites who had passed an examination in January
were on the list. All the blacks who passed the exam already have
entered the academy or are scheduled to enter this fall.
   Clarence Rease, division chief for recruiting and examining,
said the city held the recruiting drive because Sheriff Jim
McMillan is committed to hiring more black officers. Currently,
there are 900 white officers and about 200 black officers.
   Rease said he doesn't know why whites were allowed to fill out
applications to take Tuesday's test.
   ``My announcements said for blacks only. The applications said
for blacks only,'' he said.
   Three white men who showed up to take the test said they were
the victims of reverse discrimination.
   ``The first thing out of the mouth was, `White applicants cannot
take the test today,''' said a man who asked that his name not be
used. ``That's discrimination.''

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singer-songwriter Bruce Springteen's actress
wife, Julianne Phillips, filed a petition for divorce Tuesday
against the rock superstar, claiming ``irreconcilable differences''
with ``The Boss.''
   The one-page petition filed in Los Angeles Superior Court seeks
unspecified spousal support and says property rights will be
determined later, said attorney Arlene Colman-Schwimmer,
representing Miss Phillips, 28.
   The Springsteens, who were married on May 13, 1985 in Miss
Phillips' hometown of Lake Oswego, Ore., maintain a home in the Los
Angeles area, she said.
   ``Starting the divorce is simple. It's the complications that
arise later that are the problems,'' Ms. Colman-Schwimmer said.
   A spokesman for the singer could not be reached immediately for
comment, and his attorney Barry Slott did not immediately respond
to a message.
   Springsteen, called called ``The Boss'' by his fans, is known
for such rock hits as ``Born To Run,'' ``Thunder Road,'' ``Because
The Night,'' ``Rosalita,'' and ``Tunnel of Love,'' which he
dedicated to Miss Phillips.
   They first met backstage at the Los Angeles Sports Arena during
a concert by Springsteen and his E Street band in October 1984.
   He was riding the crest of his ``Born In The U.S.A'' tour and
album, and she was an aspiring actress and model earning up to
$2,000 a day.
   Rumors began floating late this spring that the couple had
separated. The petition filed Tuesday did not mention a specific
date.
   They have no children, and a spokeswoman for Springsteen has
previously denied reports he and Miss Phillips separated over the
issue of starting a family.
   During this summer's tour to promote his latest ``Tunnel of
Love'' album, Springsteen, 38, has been linked romantically in the
tabloid newspapers with red-haired E Street Band backup singer
Patti Scialfa, 36, who also was on the 1984 tour.
   Springsteen and Miss Scialfa are both natives of New Jersey.

<TEXT>
   Gov. George Deukmejian on Tuesday
vetoed a bill to make the banana slug the state mollusk, leaving a
troop of Blue Birds singing the blues.
   Deukmejian explained in his veto message that the slug isn't
Californian enough and that its reputation just doesn't fit with
California's image.
   But members of the Redwood City Blue Birds say the governor's
grasp of mollusk lore is a bit slippery.
   Deukmejian said the species was first identified in Oregon and
ranges as far north as Alaska, so it's not a true-blue Californian.
   Besides, the yellowish mollusk has an image that isn't befitting
the Golden State, he said. He suggested that native California
fauna such as the pismo clam, the black abalone, the red abalone or
the turban shell would make a better choice.
   ``If there is a need to designate a state mollusk, it would be
more appropriate to select one that is indigenous to California and
perhaps one that is more representative of the international
reputation that California enjoys,'' Deukmejian said.
   The Blue Birds who sponsored the campaign and the bill's author
said the governor was all wet.
   Four of five types of banana slug are native to California, said
Janice Hopcraft, an aide to Assemblyman Bryon Sher. Hopcraft and
her co-workers wore yellow armbands Tuesday to mark the bill's
demise.
   ``I think basically the banana slug has gotten a bad rap,'' she
said. ``They're obviously easy to look down upon, and they do have
some odd habits. Perhaps the governor looked too much at that and
not their good side.
   ``As far as its representative qualities, it's absolutely a
unique example of the diversity of California's wildlife.''
   ``Yeah, he didn't know all the facts,'' said 9-year-old Susanna
Farley, whose Blue Bird troop worked six weeks on the bill.
   ``I feel really bad that he vetoed it,'' said her friend, Grace
Moses, also 9. ``I mean, why did he have to do that? He didn't know
anything about it. I hope he watched the news about it.''
   Hopcraft said the veto is a disappointing end for the bill's
young supporters.
   ``I think this is basically the ultimate lesson for the Dynamite
Blue Birds and Camp Fire kids, that not all things have a happy
ending.''
   Gubernatorial vetoes can be overturned by two-thirds majorities
in the Assembly and Senate, but Assembly Republicans have vowed to
block any attempts to override Deukmejian's vetoes.

   A Chinese Boeing 737 jetliner crashed into the
sea while landing at Hong Kong's international airport Wednesday,
with 14 people missing and 76 others rescued, government-run radio
reported.
   Government spokesmen confirmed that an airliner of the China
National Aviation Corp. had crashed at Kai Tak International
Airport but said they had no immediate details.
   The plane was arriving from Canton, the capital of China's
Guangdong province about 90 miles northwest of this British colony,
Radio Television Hong Kong reported.
   The airport runway juts into Hong Kong's famed Victoria Harbor,
and the plane was partially submerged in the water, the radio
reported.
   There was no immediate word on the cause of the accident, but
the colony had thunderstorms throughout the morning.

   The deposed but U.S.-recognized president of
Panama, Eric Arturo Delvalle, visited this central Florida
community to buy horses, a spokesman said Tuesday.
   Alberto Garcia de Paredes, the Panamanian consul general in New
York, said he and Delvalle have been in Ocala since Saturday to
attend the annual open sale of yearling thoroughbreds at the Ocala
Breeders Sales.
   A horseman whose family was a founder of a racetrack in Panama,
Delvalle bought a filly for $30,000 on Tuesday and a colt for
$20,000 on Monday. They will be sent to Panama next March after
training in Florida, said Garcia.
   The United States has continued to recognize Delvalle as
Panama's leader since he was ousted Feb. 26 by Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega after trying to fire the military ruler. Noriega was
indicted for drug smuggling in February by federal grand juries in
Tampa and Miami.
   Delvalle, who has been in hiding in Panama, is expected to meet
with U.S. officials during his visit to this country. But the Ocala
trip ``is something completely private,'' said Consul Roberto
Dominguez.

   A U.S. Coast Guard ship arrived in
Puerto Rico Tuesday with one of two boats that were carrying $10
million worth of marijuana, officials reported.
   They said the first boat sank shortly after it was intercepted
Saturday in international waters and was being towed to Ponce on
Puerto Rico's southern coast.
   Coast Guard Capt. Dane Egli said the Honduras-registered,
30-foot boat Kiko was intercepted Saturday 70 miles north of
Colombia by the Coast Guard vessel Attu.
   ``As we towed it (the Kiko) to Ponce it sank. There were no
victims but most of its cargo of marijuana disappeared in the sea.''
   With the Kiko's crew of seven Colombians aboard, the Attu on
Monday stopped the Colombia-registered Grace Carolina 11 miles
south of Puerto Rico and detained its six Colombian crewmen.
Thirteen bundles of marijuana were confiscated.
   ``The two loads of marijuana ... were going to be brought into
Puerto Rico by the smugglers,'' said Egli. He estimated the street
value of the marijuana that was on both boats at $10 million.
   The Grace Carolina and 13 Colombians were brought to Ponce
Tuesday.
   ``We do this to earn a living because we don't have steady work
in our country,'' one of the Colombians shouted from the Attu where
he and the others were detained.

   The navy fired depth charges at what it
believes was a foreign submarine prowling off west Sweden, a
defense spokesman said Tuesday.
   It was not clear if the vessel was hit late Monday or escaped
undamaged in the Stig Fiord, 27 miles north of Goteborg, said Maj.

   Patrol boats and coast artillery troops were searching for any
sign of the submarine, he added.
   The navy had been tracking the craft since the weekend, Brissman
told The Associated Press.
   Citing lack of proof, Sweden refuses to name the country it
suspects of repeatedly violating its territorial waters. But
defense analysts and military personnel have said traces left on
the sea bottom indicated the vessels were Soviet.
   Moscow denies the allegations and says its ships have stayed
away from Sweden since one submarine ran aground outside a Swedish

<DATELINE>LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifteen blind workers who make military
equipment for the government at a workshop for the blind have
struck the facility, demanding that they receive the same pay as
their sighted co-workers.
   The employees walked off the job last week at the Southwest
Lighthouse for the Blind after they were told they would have to
pay $65 a month for health insurance.
   The strikers are asking that all blind workers be given the
$3.35-an-hour minimum wage earned by sighted employees instead of
the present $2.05 wage. They also want company-paid health
insurance.
   ``I think it's about time for some changes to be made,'' said
Teresa Wiggins, 28, as she walked a picket line outside the
Lighthouse. ``I've been here since 1984 and there's hardly anything
here for the blind. We need better opportunities.''
   The 15 strikers, among 49 employees, also want assurances that
their jobs and pay won't be affected by the walkout.
   Ms. Wiggins grosses $320 a month, an amount supplemented by a
small Social Security check. But her rent alone is $320 a month and
she has a guide dog for whom she must pay.
   ``Some of (the workers) also pay $20 a month for transportation
in the Lighthouse van,'' said William Harmon, a former workshop
employee and president of the Lubbock Chapter of the National
Federation of the Blind. ``They would be losing $85 a month out of
a $320-a-month income'' with the health insurance requirement.
   Dick Edlund of the Kansas City, Kan., office of the National
Federation of the Blind told the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal that
under federal law, blind workers can be paid only 25 percent of
wages paid to sighted workers.
   The Lighthouse, which provides jobs for blind people, is under
federal contract to produce military helmet pads and chin straps.
   The facility's director, Dale Odom, declined to comment on the
walkout or whether the strike would affect the Lighthouse's ability
to fulfill the military contract.
   The strikers also have been circulating union cards from the
Teamsters union, in hopes of gaining enough support to hold an
organizing election.

   Burt Reynolds and Loni Anderson plan to adopt a
baby that is expected to be born in a California hospital this
week, according to a publicist for Anderson.
   ``We can't promise that the baby will be born this week, but
that certainly is the hope,'' said Mickey Freeman.
   Freeman did not know when the couple, who were married April 29,
``started the ball rolling'' in locating an infant to adopt. ``I
presume they have been working on it a while.''
   ``I love kids,'' Anderson, 41, said in an interview published in
Tuesday's Daily News. ``If I'd been with the right man when I was
younger, I'd have had four.''
   Anderson, twice divorced, is the mother of a 23-year-old
daughter. Reynolds, married before to actress Judy Carne, has no
children.
   ``Burt has always wanted to be a father,'' Anderson said. ``He
asked me if at 52 he'll be able to get used to the noise of a
child. I told him it's gradual.''
   She and Reynolds, Anderson said, are still trying to have a
child of their own.

   The state agency that has taken over
Yonkers' finances warned four defiant councilmen Tuesday that
unless the U.S. Supreme Court takes their side, they will be hit
with criminal charges.
   The councilmen, who have stalled a federal judge's order to act
on a housing desegregation plan, have appealed both the judge's
ruling and asked for a stay of their fines until a decision comes
from the U.S. Supreme Court.
   The councilmen, who personally may have to pay contempt-of-court
fines of up to $500 a day, and the city, whose fines could go up to
$1 million daily, applied for stays to Supreme Court Justice
Thurgood Marshall, who often handles such appeals from the
Northeast. But a court spokesman said Tuesday afternoon the five
applications were turned over to the full court. The spokesman, who
asked not to be named, said he could give no indication when the
court might rule.
   For the third time since the contempt finding, the City Council,
at its regular meeting Tuesday night, refused to endorse the
desegregation plan, which would approve incentives for 800 units of
moderate-income housing throughout the city.
   In a packed Council chamber, Mayor Nicholas Wasicsko asked if
any of the councilmen wanted to change their vote but none of them
did. The mayor is required by the contempt ruling to have a weekly
vote on the desegregation plan.
   U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand, who in 1985 found the city
liable for segregating schools and housing for 40 years, held the
city in contempt Aug. 2 for failing to approve the housing plan.
Sand imposed fines against the city that began at $100 a day and
doubled daily. The fines were later stayed by a federal appeals
court.
   Besides the personal fines on the four councilmen, Sand also
threatened them with jail.
   On Friday, a federal appeals panel upheld the contempt finding
but gave Yonkers a week to take the case to the Supreme Court
before reinstating the penalties. The panel also capped any daily
fine at $1 million.
   The fines are slated to go back into effect Friday; the jailing
of the councilmen would come Sunday.
   Meanwhile, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said in New York City Tuesday
that even if the housing dispute in Yonkers is not a result of
racial discrimination, the city's resistance to the law is
unhealthy.
   ``We must be as intolerant of a class rejection _ because
someone is poor _ as we would be of racial or religious bigotry,''
Jackson said.
   After a meeting with black leaders in Westchester County,
Jackson said he would be willing to meet with the four councilmen.
Three of the four responded they would be happy to meet with
Jackson, while the fourth said, ``Have him call me.''
   At a meeting Tuesday of the Yonkers Emergency Financial Control
Board, its chairwoman said she will notify the district attorney
that the four councilmen are breaking the law. The state watchdog
agency was already in place because of money problems the city had
several years ago.
   ``It's the city councilmen who are defying the law and putting
the city's financial profile at risk, who are putting all the
citizens of Yonkers at risk,'' said Gail Shaffer, the chairwoman.
   Shaffer labeled the recalcitrant lawmakers ``reprehensible'' for
jeopardizing the city financially.
   Criminal charges should ``give them pause,'' Shaffer said of the
four, Henry Spallone, Nicholas Longo, Edward Fagan and Peter Chema.
   Shaffer's remarks came a day after Gov. Mario Cuomo said he
would initiate removal proceedings and urge the jailing of the
councilmen if the Supreme Court refused the stay.
   The financial control board asked City Manager Neil DeLuca to
prepare a detailed phase-out plan by Thursday for the gradual
elimination of city services.

   The military junta Tuesday picked
President Augusto Pinochet to be the sole nominee in the
presidential referendum in October, and violent demonstrations
broke out in protest. Hundreds were reported arrested and a
teen-age boy was shot to death.
   At least 19 people were reported injured.
   Pinochet, who commands the army and took part in the selection
process, was widely expected to be nominated. After his selection,
he announced that the referendum will be held Oct. 5.
   Anti-Pinochet demonstrations raged in Santiago and several
cities during the day and grew more violent after the nomination
was announced. In the capital, protesters hurled rocks, burned
buses and clashed with police and with Pinochet supporters.
   A hospital spokesman told The Associated Press by telephone that
15-year-old Erickson Palma was shot twice in the chest in a
residential neighborhood of southwest Santiago.
   The spokesman said a 14-year-old boy also was wounded, and Radio
Cooperativa reported that he also was shot from a passing car. The
station said a third person, an adult, also was wounded by a bullet.
   Local radio reports said the youths were participating in a
pot-banging protest called by the opposition when they were hit by
shots fired from a passing car.
   At 8 p.m., windows opened throughout Santiago and residents
banged pots and pans to show their displeasure with the nomination.
The show of defiance was organized by a 16-party opposition
coalition.
   Also, evening blackouts were reported in Santiago suburbs both
north and south of the city, as well as in the coastal city of La
Serena 290 miles north of the capital.
   Authorities did not disclose the cause of the power losses, but
bombing of power transmission towers is commonly carried out by
leftist guerrilla groups to protest government actions.
   Local radio stations reported protesters clashing with police in
Santiago's outlying slums during the night. The demonstrators
erected barricades of burning car tires to prevent police from
entering the neighborhoods.
   Protests began nationwide about noon, when the military leaders
convened to formally choose Pinochet for a the presidential
referendum.
   A police spokesman, Capt. Alejandro Sierra, said 19 people were
injured during the Santiago disturbances. Two police officers were
among the injured, one of whom was reported in serious condition,
Sierra said.
   He said police detained 364 protesters who would be held
overnight and then released. He said they included a U.S. citizen,
but said authorities would not release his name or that of any of
the other people arrest.
   He said four public buses were set afire and destroyed by
demonstrators, who also hurled rocks at police. There were brief
clashes between groups of pro- and anti-Pinochet civilian groups.
   If voters approve Pinochet, 72, his term will run until 1997. If
the voters reject him, open elections are to be held in 1990 and
Pinochet will remain president until then.
   ``This is a decisive moment in the institutional process begun
Sept. 11, 1973,'' Pinochet said in his acceptance speech.
   Pinochet led the bloody coup in September 1973 that ousted the
government of Marxist President Salvador Allende, who died in the
palace takeover. Pinochet has been president of the military
government since then.
   Pinochet was nominated by himself, navy chief Adm. Jose Merino,
air force leader Gen. Fernando Matthei and national police director
Gen. Rodolfo Stange in a one-hour 45-minute nomination session in
the Defense Ministry.
   Pinochet later appeared on a balcony of the government palace
and addressed about 10,000 cheering supporters.
   He said his years of rule have been dedicated to forging a
Chilean society in which a new type of democracy, with tough
safeguards against communism, will be established.
   ``The full democracy that approaches constitutes a new challenge
for everyone,'' he said. ``It also will demand of us all
overcoming, adapting and rectifying to create a new style of
political coexistence,'' he said.
   Pinochet is backed by his army, which is by far the most
powerful military service, and has campaigned for months for
popular support.
   Opposition politicians immediately denounced the selection.
   ``The nomination of Gen. Pinochet, with his own vote, as
candidate to succeed himself, is the best denial of the supposed
democratic intentions of the regime,'' the centrist Democratic
Party said in a written statement.
   Pinochet's nomination was announced by air force Gen. Enrique
Montero, secretary for the nominating session.
   He said the commanders designated Pinochet ``as the person who,
pending citizen ratification, occupies the position of president of
the republic for the (eight-year) presidential period beginning
March 11, 1989.''
   There were anti-government demonstrations in downtown Santiago
and also in Conception and Osorno in the south and and in the
centrl port city of Valparaiso.
   More than a thousand youths marched through downtown Santiago
and riot police sent them fleeing with tear gas and water cannons.
But the protesters regrouped and continued their marches during the
afternoon.
   Some of the demonstrators carried pictures of leftists who
disappeared after being arrested by security agents. Beneath the
pictures were the words: ``Where are they?.''
   Police said several bomb threats had been receivwed and they
deactivated two explosive devices, one left in a black plastic bag
a block from the government house.
   More than 7.2 million Chile's 8 million elegible voters have
registered to participate in the referendum.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis says both sides should tone down their
rhetoric because ``this campaign is a golden and historic moment''
to discuss important economic issues. But he and Republican George
Bush continued their war of words anyway as representatives of both
presidential campaigns met today to work out a schedule for
face-to-face debates.
   Dukakis made his call Monday for a return to the rhetorical high
ground while being criticized by Democrats for letting Bush control
the debate with attacks on the Democrat's patriotism, views on
defense and gun control and a Massachusetts prison furlough program.
   Dukakis, during a tour of western Massachusetts to highlight
that area's economic resurgence, said he was ``trying to get this
campaign up where it belongs'' by discussing his economic
positions. But the Massachusetts governor also countered Bush's
attacks on the furlough program and launched his own salvo on the
vice president's support for a reduction in the capital gains tax.

   Even drastic cutbacks in the release of the
chemicals blamed for causing the global ``greenhouse effect'' are
unlikely to halt the heating of the planet, according to a new
climate analysis.
   The greenhouse effect has been widely discussed recently,
although most meteorologists contend that it is too early to
determine if it is responsible for the current drought and hot
weather affecting much of the nation. The effect occurs when carbon
dioxide, largely from burning fossil fuels, and other gases
increase in the atmosphere. These gases let incoming heat from the
sun reach the Earth but they reflect outgoing heat, keeping it from
traveling back into space. That traps heat, much like a greenhouse
traps heat indoors.
   James Hansen of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, the lead author of the new study, told a
congressional subcommittee earlier in the summer that the current
hot, dry conditions are an example of things to come.

   A federally ordered building ban on major new
Southern California polluters is largely symbolic because the
region has no plans for heavy industries, fuel refineries or power
generating plants, officials say.
   The Environmental Protection Agency on Monday announced plans to
ban construction of industry emitting more than 100 tons of carbon
monoxide or ozone pollutants a year as a congressional moratorium
on such sanctions expires.
   The ban could be extended to more than a dozen other U.S.
locations, including Denver and suburban Chicago.

   More than 1,200 people were arrested this
month in a 30-nation drug crackdown unprecedented for its
international teamwork and which showed traffickers they ``will
increasingly face the combined fury'' of joint law enforcement,
Attorney General Richard Thornburgh said Tuesday.
   The operations, centered in the United States and South and
Central America, led to the seizure of 11 tons of cocaine and the
destruction of 244 tons of marijuana, 118,000 coca plants and 13
cocaine laboratories, Thornburgh announced.
   Authorities also demolished seven hidden airstrips and seized
$3.8 million in cash, he said.

   The government said Tuesday its chief
forecasting gauge of future economic activity suffered the steepest
drop in eight months in July, but few analysts expect a substantial
slackening in growth anytime soon.
   The 0.8 percent decline in the Commerce Department's Index of
Leading Economic Indicators was the biggest since last November,
when the index dropped 1.0 percent in the aftermath of the October
stock market crash.
   However, economists noted that the index posted an exceptionally

   The Soviet Union intends to continue
emphasizing its submarine force in the future and is envisioning
high-speed submarines equipped with thermal- and laser-homing
torpedoes to hunt and destroy U.S. subs, according to a new Russian
book now being studied in the West.
   The Soviets are setting goals to build submarines that can
travel at 50 to 60 knots underwater ``in the near term'' and
ultimately up to 100 knots, while diving to depths of 6,600 feet
and carrying torpedoes that can travel at 300 knots.
   The Soviet navy also expects to begin playing more of a role in
strategic air defense by deploying futuristic weapons such as
lasers and particle beam guns aboard its ships, the book says.

   William J. Bennett, in his final report as
education secretary, said Tuesday that American elementary school
pupils need stronger doses of math, science and literary classics,
as well as foreign languages starting in the fourth grade.
   Students are willing and teachers are ``for the most part good
and capable,'' Bennett said, but too many schools suffer from
defective curricula.
   At a news conference, he released a 61-page report, ``James
Madison Elementary School: A Curriculum for American Students,''
summarizing his views of what should be taught to the 32 million
youngsters enrolled in kindergarten through the eighth grade in
81,000 elementary and junior high schools.

   A group of climate researchers has warned that
the ``greenhouse effect'' warming of the Earth will continue even
if there are sharp cutbacks in the use of the chemicals which cause
the problem.
   The heatup ``appears to be inevitable, even with ... drastic,
and probably unrealistic reductions, of greenhouse forcing'' by the
release of carbon dioxide and other gases, the scientists reported
in the Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres.
   The group, led by James Hansen of the National Aeronautical and
Space Administration, reached that conclusion after running
computerized climate models in an effort to predict the climate in
the future.

   There's no way for TV talk shows to fully defend
themselves against phonies intent on putting one over on them but
such hoaxes are rare, producers said after two actors said they
posed as guests with sexual problems.
   ``If someone really has the intention to put one over on you,
I'm not sure what all the safeguards are to protect yourself,''
said Delia Fine, senior producer of ``Geraldo,'' one of the shows

   Shows like Geraldo Rivera's, Oprah Winfrey's and Sally Jessy

<HEAD>Scholars See Moral Issue In Quayle-Vietnam Furor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Religious ethicists say the central moral
question about Sen. Dan Quayle's conduct as a young man during the
Vietnam War period is whether his actions squared with his attitude.
   Some see inconsistency between his stated support for the war at
that time, while virtually assuring he wouldn't be involved in it
by joining the National Guard when he faced being drafted.
   Several theologians said in interviews that Quayle as a youth
may not have understood the implications then, and that motivations
are nebulous, but his course appears equivocal on the surface.
   The case was termed due for analysis in some ethics courses this
fall.
   ``It borders on hypocrisy, and it's certainly not heroic, but
none of us fully takes the consequences of his or her beliefs all
the time,'' said the Rev. Roger Shinn of New York's Union
Theological Seminary.
   ``There comes a time when the chips are down that you've got to
live up to your convictions and take the costs. But you can't get
involved in every fight that comes along, even if you believe in
it. You muddle through, sit one out.''
   Shinn, a teacher of Christian ethics for a quarter century,
counseled troubled students during the Vietnam War. He noted some
opposed it, paying for it by going to jail, while some supported it
and died in Vietnam.
   ``Either way, they paid the costs,'' he said. ``That's what real
integrity is. Whether you agree with a person or not, acting with
integrity means taking a stand and willingness to suffer for it.''
   Quayle says he entered the National Guard so as to go to law
school. ``I did not join to avoid service in Vietnam,'' he says. He
says he ``supported the goals of fighting communism in Vietnam''
and disliked the ``no-win policy aspect.''
   Ethicists say the issue was not his entering the Guard, which
many war opponents did to avoid the draft, and not mainly whether
he used family influence to do it, but whether he practiced what he
preached.
   ``If you believe one way, you have to act consistently with it
or your ethical stance collapses,'' said Catholic psychologist
Eugene Kennedy of Loyola University in Chicago.
   Th Rev. Paul Simmons, who teaches Christian ethics at Southern
Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky., said if Quayle was
``really honest about it, he would come clean that he was dodging
the draft.
   ``The real issue is one of honesty and straightforwardness. If
he supported Vietnam and then tried to get out of it, it was
hypocritical to the core. It was not a matter of conscience, but of
expediency.''
   Moral philosopher Peter Simpson of the Catholic University of
America in Washington said Quayle's course raises ``a small
question mark about his integrity.''
   ``But it's relatively minor,'' Simon said. ``It's not worth all
the hullabaloo. I have doubts about how strong his convictions were
on Vietnam. Maybe he should have sought to go there and help the
cause.
   ``But he chose not to for reasons we don't fully understand. You
can't judge guilt from the outside, but should give a person the
benefit of the doubt. Young men make mistakes. We're all entitled
to be wrong sometimes.
   ``He may now regret it.''
   Catholic moral theologian Germain Grisez of St. Mary's College
in Emmitsburg, Md., said it is not clearly inconsistent for people
to favor ``fighting a war, but not particularly want to be in it
themselves.
   ``Very often people want their dirty work done, but don't want
to do it themselves. I'm not sure it's wrong, and not sure it's all
right either. It's a question of fairness, of being unfair to other
people by shirking.
   ``It's clearly not heroic character, but that does not mean it's
immoral.''
   Rabbi Alexander Schindler, an ethical scholar and president of
the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, said there ``seems to
be quite a distance'' between what Quayle ``professes and what he
does.
   ``Obviously one should not proclaim what he fails to do. If his
words belie his deeds, he becomes a hypocrite. Actions should come
close to ideals. Yet nobody's actions reflect the ideal totally.
Everybody fails it sometimes.''
   The Rev. James T. Burtchaell of the University of Notre Dame
said people may see Quayle's ``strong view of the war as in
conflict with his public action... I don't think he's profound
enough to be hypocritical.''
   Episcopal moral theologian Harmon Smith of Duke University said
``the meaning of actions and statements always have to be
interpreted. I don't know how to say his are consistent, but I
reckon that he does.
   ``Typically there is more than one way to look at it.''

   The Roman Catholic Church should
admit women to ordination as priests, says Catholic scholar the
Rev. Godfrey Diekmann.
   Diekmann, 80, a Benedictine authority on liturgy who helped
draft the worship reforms of the 1962-65 Second Vatican Council,
says the failure of the church to ordain women was based on custom,
not tradition.
   Referring to arguments that priests must ``image'' a male
Christ, he told a symposium: ``Our consistent and really authentic
tradition about imaging Christ finds that image first of all, not
in bodily similarity, but in spiritual affinity.''
   Diekmann, who teaches patristics (writings of the early church
fathers) at St. John's University, cited past ordination of women
as deaconesses to perform liturgical functions, and said:
   ``Pastoral experience, in fact desperate liturgical needs,
similarly cry out for women priests today.''

   For years, the long narrow building with
peeling paint, boarded windows and a single lightbulb above the
door has been a favorite hangout for heavy drinkers, pool shooters
and drug dealers.
   But if former hard-drinker Gus Odom and some of his friends have
their way, the Royal Palm Cafe will throw out the bottles and break
out the Bibles. They want to convert the notorious bar into a
church: The Prayer Line Church of God.
   ``We're pulling the devil out and bringing Jesus in,'' says
Odom, 36, who remembers years of drinking, carousing and carrying a
gun inside the Royal Palm. ``Before I started serving God, I used
to drink there myself.''
   Now a weed sprayer for the South Florida Water Management
District, Odom also remembers how drug dealers outside the bar
brought his neighborhood down. He thought of the bar-to-church
conversion one day after getting religion.
   Since his small congregation needed a new place to meet, he
approached Lorenze Holcy, 56, owner of the Royal Palm for 17 years.
Holcy, receptive to the idea, offered to sell for $25,000.
   Church of God headquarters in Cleveland, Tenn., has offered to
provide $10,000 toward the cost, while members and supporters have
to raise the other $15,000. ``With the help of the Lord, we're
going to pull it off,'' Odom said.

<HEAD>`Dynasty' Aims for Cleaner Lifestyles</HEAD>
<HEAD>Changes Aimed at Making Show More Than an Also-Ran Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY NEUMEISTER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   ``Dynasty'' isn't exactly turning into a bastion
of high morality, but its new producer promises more meaningful
relationships than affairs this season, and more ginger ale than
gin-and-tonics.
   David Paulsen, named executive producer of the show as it begins
its ninth season, said he's betting that more realism, more action
and some new characters will attract more viewers _ even as the
characters clean up their acts.
   ``I don't think people will be popping in and out of every
bed,'' he said. ``In the age of herpes and AIDS, it's irresponsible
to have flagrant bed hopping and I don't think we ought to do it.''
   He promised that men and women would develop less ephemeral
relationships, and there would be less smoking and drinking on
``Dynasty.''
   ``We're going to cut that down, because I just don't think it's
healthy,'' Paulsen said, although he cautioned that any one show
should not be used as a barometer of societal changes.
   Paulsen, who was in New York auditioning actors and actresses
for the show, is no stranger to glamorous prime-time soaps. He
spent five years writing or directing more than 50 episodes of
``Dallas.'' He also was supervising producer of ``Knots Landing''
for one year.
   ``Dynasty'' finished the 1987-88 television season ranked 37th
out of 85 regularly scheduled series.
   Although he is planning some new wrinkles for ``Dynasty,''
Paulsen said some of the strengths of the past will be revived.
   ``We'll see the character of Blake (Carrington) be a driving
force again. The character was allowed to weaken,'' he said.
   Blake will ``lead the charge'' of men with stronger
personalities, he said. ``The women have always been the stronger
force,'' he added.
   Also, there will be more action in the episodes, and, he said,
``we're going to tell a faster story.''
   One of the new characters will be a young detective, ``a street
guy somewhere between Serpico and Colombo,'' he said.
   And although there will be plenty of elegant clothing, diamonds
and fancy place settings, there will be more people from other
walks of life, ``people who even live without air conditioning,''
Paulsen said.
   Thus, viewers will see more of what it is like when the rich
encounter the poor, experiences projected from the typewriters of
three new writers, two of whom were reporters until this year, he
said.
   The changes in the show are aimed at higher ratings. But he said
the effort to clean up the lifestyles of his characters came from
his desire to reflect changing values in America. And he insists
that television shows can affect the way viewers live.
   He recalled that once, in a scene of a television sitcom, a
character in a car made passing mention of fastening seatbelts.
   ``For four or five days afterward, police departments noticed a
distinct drop in fatalities and serious injuries,'' he said. ``It
was a very humbling experience that showed that although we're not
out to preach, there are subtle things you can do.''

<HEAD>Briton in Competition to Become West's First Chess Millionaire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lying on the floor in his north London apartment,
Jonathan Speelman shook his head, smiled, and parried the
suggestion he might become the West's first chess millionaire.
   On Aug. 23, the 31-year-old grandmaster became the first player
to reach the semifinals of the World Chess Championship, which puts
him only two victories away from a 1990 title match with the
reigning world champion, Garri Kasparov of the Soviet Union.
   He will not know his semi-finals opponent until the three
remaining quarterfinals matches are played in January.
   No British player has ever reached such an advanced stage of
this competition. Ten years ago, Britain had no chess grandmasters
and chess was far from a big-money competition.
   But corporate sponsors and paying spectators have put top
players in the financial big leagues.
   The loser of the 1990 world championship duel will be guaranteed
three-eighths of the expected $2 million prize fund. The 1987 world
face-off between Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov in Seville, Spain, had
a winners' pot totaling $1.85 million.
   As an added incentive, the West German computer company Mephisto
will give 1 million Swiss francs ($637,000) to the first Westerner
to challenge Kasparov.
   But the 6-foot, 3-inches tall Speelman said in an interview that
money ``is not my major consideration.''
   For Speelman, chess is an intellectual pursuit and he remains
determined not to own a car or television.
   His 3{-to-1{ victory in the quarterfinals over fellow Briton
Nigel Short, 23, the world's third ranked player and pre-match
favorite, netted Speelman a $21,250 prize, his biggest ever.
   But critics fear his disarmingly peaceful disposition and
non-competitive approach aren't winning ingredients.
   ``He's got to become less modest,'' said Jonathan Tisdall, an
American international master who lives in Norway and served as an
adviser to Speelman in the quarterfinals.
   Speelman admits feeling sorry for his opponents.
   ``Of course I always want to win, but I don't want my opponent
to lose,'' he said.
   In contrast to Short, who left school at 16 and once played in a
rock-group called ``The Urge,'' or the flamboyant Kasparov, who
employs a Western business manager, Speelman appears as the
stereotype intellectual chess player.
   Bearded and bespectacled, he studied mathematics at Oxford
University and, after earning his grandmaster title in 1980, took a
year's break from the game to learn Russian.
   Speelman writes poetry and enjoys word games. Competing in
Canada this year, he was delighted when a friend in London sent him
The Times of London crossword by facsimile.
   He has also been involved in political battles.
   In May 1986, he took part in a demonstration outside London's
Prince Edward Theater on the opening night of the musical ``Chess''
to lend support to Boris Gulko, a leading Soviet grandmaster, in
his campaign to gain exit visas to Israel for his family.
   Gulko, who once went on a 40-day hunger strike, received his
emigration papers several months later and now lives in Boston.
   Last year, Speelman jointly hosted a simultaneous chess
exhibition to raise money for medical supplies for Nicaragua's
Sandinista government.
   Speelman has spent up to six months a year abroad and his
knowledge of Russian has helped build friendships.
   International Master Bob Wade of Britain said Speelman's
creativity makes him the ``most difficult of opponents to predict.''
   He first learned the chess moves at age 6. At 13, he won the
British under-14 championship and since then his career has been
marked by a gradual, but consistent improvement.
   In 1986, in Dubai on the Persian Gulf, he was ranked fifth among
Britain's grandmasters and played for the England team that won the
silver medal in the biennial chess Olympiad.
   In the last two years, however, Speelman said, a ``a quantum
jump'' took him to fifth ranked player in the world. He said he
doesn't know what happened. He just got better.
   ``Chess is basically scientific but there is also a strong
psychological and artistic side,'' he said. ``Because it's so
intense, you can reach parts of yourself which you wouldn't very
often, a higher state of mind perhaps.''
   On his way to meet Short, Speelman overwhelmed the top U.S.
player, Yasser Seirawan, by a score of 4-1 in a six-game match.

<HEAD>Pope to Beatify Missionary in Kingdom Encircled by South Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>THABA BOSIU, Lesotho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On his visit to this kingdom
surrounded by South Africa, Pope John Paul II will come here to a
sacred mountain where a French missionary helped native people
threatened by white men more than 100 years ago.
   Later on during his stop in Lesotho on his five-nation tour of
southern Africa Sept. 10-19, the pontiff will beatify the Roman
Catholic missionary, the Rev. Joseph Gerard.
   At Thaba Bosiu on Sept. 14, the pontiff will meet King
Moshoeshoe II on the same spot where King Moshoeshoe I in 1862
first welcomed Christian missionaries to his land, torn by internal
violence and threatened by the surrounding white Boers, the
settlers of what today is South Africa.
   Gerard was one of the missionaries, who traveled through the
mountains on horseback wrapped in wool blankets as the Basotho (the
people of Lesotho) still do.
   Gerard climbed the rocky, natural fortress of Thaba Bosiu _
``The Mountain of the Night'' in the local language _ several times
during the 1865-68 conflict with the white Boers, sneaking past
them to bring food and encouragement to the thousands of Basotho
crowded onto the top of the 600-foot-high plateau.
   The missionaries persuaded Moshoeshoe I to seek protection from
Britain's Queen Victoria. As a result, Basutoland, as the area was
called, became a British protectorate and was saved from annexation
into what was later to become South Africa.
   Basutoland became independent Lesotho in 1966.
   The 12,134-square-mile kingdom _ about half the size of West
Virginia _ has almost no industry, only one-third of its land is
arable, and it relies heavily on the earnings of 140,000 Basotho
men who work in South Africa, which is not on the pope's itinerary.
   The pope will beatify Gerard during a Mass at a racetrack near
here on Sept. 15 before departing next day for Swaziland.
   The pontiff will not go to the summit of Thaba Bosiu, the royal
burial ground, where residents say a large dune of fine, red sand
at the summit contains the spirit of the first king, and like him,
never leaves the mountaintop. When the dune approaches the edge,
upward drafts of wind blow it back.
   King Moshoeshoe I discovered the mountain refuge in 1824 and
gathered feuding, destitute, and some cannibalistic tribes together
to found the Basotho nation. He welcomed the missionaries, and
spent his last years trying to choose whether to become a Catholic
or a Protestant. When he died without making a decision, Gerard
wrote, ``I have never felt such great sorrow in my life.''
   The present king is Catholic, as are 70,000 other Basotho.
Ninety percent of the population of 1,443,853 are Christian; the
rest are animists.
   Gerard died in 1914, after working for 52 years among the
Basotho, establishing schools, a hospital and a church, supervising
the printing of books in the Sesotho language and converting
Basotho to Catholicism.
   His mission at Roma is now run by a French Canadian, the Rev.
Gilles Jalbert, who gave up horseback riding a few years ago. He
supervised construction of a chapel over Gerard's grave, chopped
down trees and prepared rest quarters for the pope's entourage. He
hopes electricity will reach Roma by the time the pope does, so the
Mass at the nearby sports ground can be amplified.
   The pope will visit Gerard's grave, from which local people have
been taking dirt for decades to sprinkle on their crops, homes and
children to bring good fortune.
   Gerard is being beatified, the first step toward sainthood,
because of the healing of a 6-year-old blind girl in 1928, 14 years
after his death. Doctors couldn't cure Florina Phakela, so a priest
at the Roma mission had a bag of soil from Gerard's grave tied
around her neck and told her mother to pray for nine days.
   The girl, who died in 1982, told Vatican investigators she was
visited in the night by a priest who told her she was cured. When
she woke in the morning, her sight restored, she went to the
mission to thank the priest, but couldn't find him.
   She identified a picture of Gerard as the one who had visited
her.

hailing a new law that imposes fines or jail sentences on anyone
convicted of discrimination based on race, religion or sex.
   They call it a significant advance in the protection of civil
liberties in Argentina.
   ``We think the law has extraordinary social and political
significance for Argentine society,'' said David Goldberg,
president of the Delegation of Argentine Israelite Associations.
   ``There was a gap in previous legislation in that there was no
penalty for those who did discriminate,'' said Goldberg, a medical
doctor whose organization is the largest of several that represent
the estimated 400,000 Jews in this South American country.
   Simon Lazara, a Socialist congressman and a leader of the
Permanent Assembly for Human Rights, said, ``The law is not solely
aimed at anti-Semitism, but also at discrimination based on color
or creed, or against the native (Indian) communities.''
   The legislation was introduced early in 1984 by President Raul
Alfonsin, who co-founded and ran the Permanent Assembly for Human
Rights before he was elected to office in October 1983. His
inauguration seven weeks later ended a harsh, nearly eight-year
military dictatorship.
   As reworked and finally approved by Congress in August, the new
law penalizes anyone who ``arbitrarily blocks, obstructs or
restricts ... the full exercise ... of fundamental rights and
guarantees.''
   Argentina's Constitution of 1853 as amended protects the right
to assembly, universal suffrage and freedom of speech and worship,
although Roman Catholicism is the country's official religion and
only Catholics can hold the nation's presidency and vice presidency.
   The law punishes by jail up to three years anyone convicted of
belonging to an organization that promotes the superiority of one
race or color or creed over another.
   Anyone convicted of a crime or offense committed ``in
persecution or hatred of a race, religion or nationality, or with
the intent to destroy ... a national, ethnic, racial or religious
group,'' could be sentenced to additional fines or prison.
   The law also requires restitution in cases of property damage.
   ``Overall, the new law constitutes a vision of the new democracy
in Argentina, reflecting the conditions that have existed since the
end of the last military dictatorship,'' Lazara said.
   Argentina's century-old tradition of democracy has been
tarnished by six military interventions since 1930, including coups
that ousted Gen. Juan D. Peron in 1955, two civilian presidents in
the 1960s, and Peron's wife Isabel in 1976.
   More than 9,000 Argentines, most of them sons and daughters of
the middle class, ``disappeared'' and are presumed dead following
their arrests in the late 1970s by security forces trying to crush
the Montonero urban guerrillas and leftist political opposition in
general.
   Discrimination usually is not overt, but it is pervasive. Darker
skinned Argentines of Indian descent, while not barred from
white-collar jobs, more commonly are manual laborers. Very few Jews
are in the army. Women are paid less than men for doing the same
job.
   Anti-Semitism in recent years has been reflected by the knocking
over of Jewish tombstones in cemeteries, the painting of
anti-Semitic graffitti on walls and, very infrequently but always
intimidating, the setting off of small bombs in the doorways of
synagogues.
   ``We don't have a very serious problem of discrimination based
on religion or race, but there is, in the background, among certain
sectors, some anti-Semitism,'' said Jose Ignacio Lopez, Alfonsin's
press secretary.
   Angel Grushka, leader of the leftist Federation of Jewish
Cultural Entities, said the new law is helpful, but he added tha
the wished the acts of discrimination that would invoke the
penalties were more precisely spelled out.
   ``We still have to work very hard on the judicial level to make
sure that anti-Semitic actions are punished,'' Grushka said.
   Anti-discrimination legislation in Argentine law dates to 1949.
In 1964, similar legislation that penalized those convicted of
discrimination was implemented, but that legislation was revoked by
the military government that came to power two years later.

   ``We intend to stay together.'' So declared
representatives of l47 mostly North American and West European
Protestant denominations 40 years ago.
   ``Christ has made us his own, and he is not divided,'' said that
1948 founding assembly of the World Council of Churches in
Amsterdam, the Netherlands. ``In seeking him we find one another.''
   Their pact has grown to include 307 denominations of virtually
all Christian traditions of every race and continent, East and
West, totaling more than 400 million members.
   Its formation amid the ruins of World War II raised an
ecumenical landmark in the cause of Christian unity. ``It is the
great new fact of our time,'' said the late Archbishop of
Canterbury Willilam Temple.
   That mid-century coming together of Christians signalled a
reversal of more than 400 years of church fragmentation, antagonism
and rivalry in the West and 1,000 years of uncommunicative
separation from churches of the East.
   Results have ``overcome centuries of indifference and even
hatred among Christians,'' affirming that ``we are one people,''
says the Rev. Emilio Castro, council general secretary.
   Now actively allied, they jointly probe their differences,
dissolving mutual misconceptionsealing of the documents by Kenkel,
who then directed them to be made public July 18 but gave the
government 10 days to appeal the decision.
   At the same time, Kenkel said the more sensitive affidavits used
to support the request for the warrants could remain secret for 45
more days.
   Harvey, noting that there was no disagreement that the
information should eventually be made public, said the real dispute
was over timing. He said all the documents should stay sealed the
same amount of time.

   For years, the long narrow building with
peeling paint, boarded windows and a single lightbulb above the
door has been a favorite hangout for heavy drinkers, pool shooters
and drug dealers.
   But if former hard-drinker Gus Odom and some of his friends have
their way, the Royal Palm Cafe will throw out the bottles and break
out the Bibles. They want to convert the notorious bar into a
church: The Prayer Line Church of God.
   ``We're pulling the devil out and bringing Jesus in,'' says
Odom, 36, who remembers years of drinking, carousing and carrying a
gun inside the Royal Palm. ``Before I started serving God, I used
to drink there myself.''
   Now a weed sprayer for the South Florida Water Management
District, Odom also remembers how drug dealers outside the bar
brought his neighborhood down. He thought of the bar-to-church
conversion one day after getting religion.
   Since his small congregation needed a new place to meet, he
approached Lorenze Holcy, 56, owner of the Royal Palm for 17 years.
Holcy, receptive to the idea, offered to sell for $25,000.
   Church of God headquarters in Cleveland, Tenn., has offered to
provide $10,000 toward the cost, while members and supporters have
to raise the other $15,000. ``With the help of the Lord, we're
going to pull it off,'' Odom said.

   Leaders of the Christian Reformed
Church have approved new, non-sexist wording in a key teaching
document, the Heidelberg Catechism.
   The church's 1988 synod agreed to modify the catechism's male
language, such as changing the questions, ``Did God create man so
wicked and perverse?'' and ``Are all men saved through Christ?'' to
``Did God create people so wicked and perverse?'' and ``Are all

   An internationally renowned Roman
Catholic scholar, the Rev. Godfrey Diekmann, says the church should
admit women to ordination as priests.
   Diekmann, 80, a Benedictine authority on liturgy who helped
draft the worship reforms of the 1962-65 Second Vatican Council,
says the failure of the church to ordain women was based on custom,
not tradition.
   Referring to arguments that priests must ``image'' a male
Christ, he told a symposium: ``Our consistent and really authentic
tradition about imaging Christ finds that image first of all, not
in bodily similarity, but in spiritual affinity.''
   Diekmann, who teaches patristics (writings of the early church
fathers) at St. John's University, cited past ordination of women
as deaconesses to perform liturgical functions, and said:
   ``Pastoral experience, in fact desperate liturgical needs,
similarly cry out for women priests today.''

   In the year since he lost his legs trying
to block a trainload of munitions, S. Brian Willson has become a
symbol of inspiration in the movement for peace in Central America.
   Hundreds have been stirred to maintain 'round-the-clock protests
at the Concord Naval Weapons Station since last Sept. 1, the day
the slow-moving Navy train, under orders not to stop, rolled over
Willson as he sat on the tracks. The demonstrators, surrounded by
picket signs, sleeping bags and American flags, stand by as trains
and trucks carry weapons across Port Chicago Highway, which cuts
through the base.
   ``Because of what I chose to do and what the Navy chose to do,
I'm a symbol and that can be used for good, I think,'' Willson, 47,
said this week in an interview at the San Francisco-based Institute
for the Practice of Nonviolence, which he founded with his wife,
Holly Rauen.
   The soft-spoken Willson, a Vietnam veteran born on the Fourth of
July and raised in a conservative, politically inactive family in
Ashville, N.Y., said he's more convinced than ever of the need to
campaign for peace and a halt to weapons shipments to Central
American nations.
   ``I don't think it was a mistake and I don't regret what I did.
I'm sorry the train ran over me and that I lost my legs. It's a
drag,'' he said. ``I feel more liberated than ever to speak the
truth, so I don't have any desire or wish to back off,'' he said.
   In the past year, Willson has spoken across the country. At the
scene of the accident 40 miles east of San Francisco,
demonstrations, prayers, rallies and civil disobedience still
elicit headlines, thanks to high-profile protesters such as the
Rev. Jesse Jackson, Joan Baez, Martin Sheen, author Alice Walker
and peace activist Daniel Ellsberg.
   An ecumenical service will be held at the weapons station
Thursday to mark the anniversary of Willson's maiming.
   It will be the first time since June 10 that Willson has visited
the spot where he inspires protesters but riles many of the 450
people in the adjacent town of Clyde, who have grown weary of the
sight and sound of demonstrators on their doorstep.
   When demonstrators posted a handmade sign reading ``Brian,''
made to look like the town sign of ``Clyde'' across the road from
the base gates, residents were outraged. The sign came down after a
session with a county mediator.
   Don Elam is typical of most townspeople today. He complains the
protest site is an eyesore and demonstrators are ``left-wing
radicals who sympathize with communist governments.''
   The protesters meet with a wide range of responses. Earlier this
week, 19-year-old Spaulding Brook of Vermont was leaning on the
base fence near a sign reading ``Wage Peace'' when a man drove
past, blared ``Boo'' through a megaphone and gestured obscenely. A
carload of men yelled, ``Go home.'' Others driving by flash peace
signs.
   The county has spent about $335,000 for patrols of Contra Costa
Sheriff's deputies, who have arrested some 325 people since last
Sept. 1, according to Sgt. Doug Sizemore.
   Tired of the marathon protest and concerned about safe
transportation of explosives across a 200-foot intersection, the
Navy wants to build a $10 million overpass to takes vehicles over
the highway, said base spokesman Dan Tikalsky.
   While the Navy seeks funding from the Defense Department, others
have turned to the courts.
   County prosecutors have failed to convict any protesters.
Willson has sued the Navy and the crew of the train that refused to
stop, and the crew has countersued.
   The Northern California chapter of the American Civil Liberties
Union sued to stop use of a painful choke hold on protesters being
arrested. A federal court rejected a county request for permission
to remove protesters' tables, chairs and picket signs from the edge
of the highway.
   So the demonstrators remain, suffering occasional attacks with
eggs, bottles and obscenities.
   Chuck Goodmacher of the Mount Diablo Peace Center in nearby
Walnut Creek, which helps coordinate the protests, says the local
antagonism is ironic because, in 1986, voters only narrowly
rejected a measure urging the government to halt arms shipments
through the county until there was a regional peace settlement in
Central America.
   Sandy Hillard is one of the few locals who have joined the
protests. Her car has been painted with swastikas, pelted with eggs
and had its tires flattened.
   ``I wish they (protest opponents) could get to know us better
before making a judgment,'' Hillard said. ``It's unfortunate to
live in a community with fears of getting your house burned down.''

   How many times have the rumors
spread through some nightspot _ ``Bob Dylan's supposed to show up.''
   This time it's no rumor. Dylan is due here soon for a very rare
interview.
   The site of this event is Il Cielo, a lovely Italian restaurant.
   The violin music is soothing, but it doesn't block out memories
of ``Don't Look Back,'' the 1967 documentary that included Dylan's
razor-tongued evisceration of a hapless magazine reporter, or the
more recent snippet in the Rolling Stone 20th anniversary TV
special that showed Dylan bitterly complaining about fans who dare
to approach him because his songs have touched them. ``That has
nothin' to do with me,'' he griped.
   Dylan doesn't make an entrance, he materializes, slipping in
through a back entrance. He is polite, subdued, nervous about doing
an interview. After settling in a chair, he checks all around him
like a skittish colt suddenly released into an unfamiliar corral.
   He puts the ubiquitous sunglasses on the table, quietly
dismisses mineral water, accepts white wine, asks, ``Will it bother
you if I smoke?'' Invited to go ahead, he takes out a pack of
Salems. He says he quits occasionally. He sits forward and answers
questions earnestly, looking directly at the interviewer with his
big, blue eyes.
   Dylan looks fit at 47, and he isn't slowing down. He's on his
third tour in as many years, just released ``Down in the Groove,''
his seventh LP in eight years and is already thinking of another
for next year when he also hopes to tour the Soviet Union. He's
also planning to launch a movie and TV production company.
   He has just completed three high-energy, sell-out performances
at Los Angeles' Greek Theatre. Since going on the road in June,
Dylan is proving that, far from being over the hill, he's at the
top of his form.
   The tour has drawn critical raves and has been extended at least
through Oct. 16-19, when he'll do a four-night stand at New York's
Radio City Music Hall, his first performance at the legendary
theater.
   Backed by a tight, three-piece rock band led by guitarist G.E.
Smith of ``Saturday Night Live'' renown, Dylan has rejuvenated his
classic material, resurrecting such timeless gems as ``Boots of
Spanish Leather,'' ``Times They Are A-Changin''' and ``Masters of
War.''
   ``When I'm singin' my songs, it never occurs to me that I wrote
them,'' Dylan says.
   ``If I didn't have a song like `Masters of War,' I'd find a song
like `Masters of War' to sing. Same thing with `Times They are
A-Changin'.' If I didn't have a song like that, I'd go out and look
around and I'd search around until I found one like that, you
know?''
   There's a line in ``Masters of War'' about being afraid to bring
children into the world. Dylan, now divorced, has five.
   ``I don't sing that line,'' he jokes. ``I love children. I was
always taught that if you were blessed to have them, you just had
more of them. They're protection from the world.''
   His eldest daughter just married, suggesting a possible new
phase in his life. The rebel voice of the 1960s is after all
nearing 50.
   ``I wouldn't mind being a grandfather, or a great-grandfather
for that matter,'' he says, ``but I don't know if that has anything
to do with age. I know people in their 30s who are grandparents. I
don't know how old I am. I mean, people tell me how old I am, but I
have no way of knowing if they're tellin' me the truth or not.''
   When his children were young, he moved them from New York to
Malibu, Calif., to protect them from the effects of fame and ``so
they could grow up in a little more country environment, at least
hear the birds singing.''
   ``There's just something instinctive that tells me that a man
must support his family, no matter what. As it is, I'm doing what I
do because I've been given to do it,'' he says.
   ``But most of the people who work 9 to 5 have got to support
families, and there's a tremendous disregard for that. You don't
see much of that being heralded with heroic words and fancy awards.
But that's what makes the world either rise or fall, that
commitment to family.''
   The lead song on ``Down in the Groove'' _ the Wilbert Harrison
blues song, ``Let's Stick Together'' _ echoes that sentiment: ``It
might be tough for a while, you might consider the child. Cannot be
happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together ...''
   The album surprised some critics because it is mostly covers of
other composers' songs. There are only two Dylan originals, plus
two collaborations with Grateful Dead songwriter Robert Hunter,
including the single ``Silvio.''
   Dylan said he picked the other material because he liked it.
``Down in the Groove'' establishes Dylan as a recording artist with
the strength of style to transcend the source of the material.
   ``There's no rule that claims that anyone must write their own
songs,'' he says. ``And I do. I write a lot of songs. But so what,
you know? You could take another song somebody else has written and
you can make it yours. I'm not saying I made a definitive version
of anything with this last record, but I liked the songs. Every so
often you've gotta sing songs that're out there. You just have to,
just to keep yourself straight.''
   The other reason for the others is inevitable: He didn't have
enough material of his own for an album.
   ``Writing is like such an isolated thing. You're in such an
isolated frame of mind,'' he says. ``You have to get into or be in
that place. In the old days, I could get to it real quick. I can't
get to it like that no more. It's not that simple.
   ``I mean, just being able to shut yourself off for long periods
of time, where you're so isolated no one can get to you, mentally
or physically, you know? You need to be able to do that in order to
come up with that kind of stuff.
   ``You're always capable of it in your youth and especially if
you're an unknown and nobody cares _ like if you're an anonymous
person. But once that all ends, then you have to create not only
what you want to do, but you have to create the environment to do
it in, which is double-hard.

   ``I don't write about things,'' he says. ``I write from inside
of something, and I sing and play the same way. It's never about
that `something,' hoping to touch it. It's rather from the inside
of it reaching out.''
   Dylan said he does have five or six songs for a new album. And
he's part of an incognito group, The Willburys, that includes
George Harrison, Roy Orbison and Tom Petty and has an album coming
out later this year.
   In the past few years, he's concentrated on touring _ with the
Grateful Dead, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, now with this
pared-down band that has Dylan alone out front most of the time,
performing selections from the vast catalog of an almost 30-year
career. Nobody would blame him for just putting his feet up for a
while.
   ``I really don't have anyplace to put my feet up,'' he laughs.
``Well, we want to play 'cause we want to play. ... Why tour? It's
just that you get accustomed to it over the years. The people
themselves will tell you when to stop touring.''
   This tour has brought Dylan the critical praise that seems
tougher for him to come by than it is for other artists. He seems
to be held up to a higher standard because of his own
bigger-than-life image, and that irritates him.
   ``It's irritating. It's real irritating,'' he says. ``It's not
that somebody can't come and not like what you're doing, that's OK.
But I've done tours before where people got real personal with
their reviews in a real early time when we were on the road, and
for some reason all the towns that we were about to play, they'd
like to pick these things up. So it was like intentionally telling
people to stay away.
   ``I don't know. I go through a lot of that, and then even when
you're not doing what they say you're doing, people expect to see
that. It's like when we were playing after being booed in Newport
or something (in 1965 he brought an electric band to the folk
festival). I mean, for the next six months, people want to see that
same show that got booed, and they want to boo, too.''
   He is interrupted: Does he have a request for the restaurant's
violinist? Sure, he says, ``Love Me or Leave Me.''
   Dylan's unexpected tastes and perspectives often perplex his
public, though he insists he is not, as frequently described,
``enigmatic.''
   ``I don't know what that word means,'' he protests.
   ``I would like to think that I couldn't be categorized. Who
wants to be categorized? That happens because of all the stuff I
do, not because of who I am or anything. And I don't even know if
that's a true fact because that's nothing much to concern me. You
can't make it too long on being an enigma.''
   If his critics can't categorize him, they certainly can't accuse
him of playing it safe. He seems to depend on literary and
spiritual references that keep him constantly searching for new
influences.
   He stunned the public in 1979 when he came out with the
emotional, gospel LP ``Slow Train Coming.'' The lead song, ``Gotta
Serve Somebody,'' won him his only Grammy, an honor he considers
``an accident.'' The album was one of Dylan's strongest ever and
went platinum (1 million copies sold).
   ``Gospel music is about the love of God. And commercial music is
about the love of sex,'' Dylan says.
   After following up with ``Saved'' and ``Shot of Love,'' Dylan,
who was born Jewish, seemed to drift away from the Christian
message, though themes of redemption tinged ``Infidels'' and
``Empire Burlesque.''
   His current religious leanings are the object of speculation.
``Religion has nothing to do with faith,'' is all he'll say
publicly on the subject. But another of his gospel songs, ``Death
Is Not the End,'' turned up on ``Down in the Groove.''
   So did the Tin Pan Alley tune ``When Did You Leave Heaven?'' And
at a recent concert he delighted the crowd by bursting into ``I'm
in the Mood for Love.''
   Last year, he appeared on a PBS tribute to George Gershwin. He
was surprised when the producers invited him to participate. ``I
said, `Are you sure? You sure there might not be another Bob
Dylan?'''
   Dylan has always been intrigued by Gershwin's music, he says,
``'cause it sounds like sophisticated city stuff, but there's a
country, backwood, alley cat element to it that for some reason he
was able to capture.
   ``There are smells and tastes in those songs for some reason.
And I was used to hearing Nina Simone sing a lot of George Gershwin
songs a few years back, and they were very close to the folk songs
that I was singing.''
   Folk songs have an honored place in Dylan's current repertoire,
a purposeful homage to his roots. He plays the standards ``Barbara
Allen'' and ``Golden Vanities'' on stage, and included his own
arrangement of ``Shenandoah'' on ``Down in the Groove.''
   Earlier this year, he was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall
of Fame and played ``Like a Rolling Stone,'' the anthem of the rock
generation, at the ceremony. But folk music is in his heart. He
contributed a cut to the recent LP honoring Leadbelly and Woody
Guthrie.
   Born Robert Zimmerman in Minnesota _ he later legally changed
his name _ Dylan migrated to New York in part to visit Guthrie in
the hospital. He soon became a sensation playing his songs of
biting social commentary in Greenwich Village coffee houses. But he
infuriated folk purists when he took up the electric guitar by the
mid-'60s. Ironically, Dylan is now in a better position than the
purists to champion folk music in the '80s.
   ``People don't know folk songs anymore,'' he says. ``I mean,
hardly anybody sings them anymore, and people think that people who
play the acoustic guitar and write their own songs are folk
singers, but that's not necessarily true. They're writing their own
songs, but they're not really based on anything. So I thought,
well, if I'm going around again, I'm going to sing folk songs,
because first of all, I love 'em, and the lyrics in them are _ I
mean, they're incredible stories, and that's where I got a lot of
my stuff from in the early years _ and still do. Folk songs are
still better, even though they're not commercial, they're still
better than 90 percent of the stuff you hear on the radio.
   ``Have you ever seen a Shakespeare play? I mean, it's like the
English language at its peak where one line will come out like a
stick of dynamite, and you'll be so what-was-that! But then the
other stuff is rolling on so fast you can't even think, and then
you have to struggle to catch up to where you are in the present.
And folk songs are pretty much like the same way.
   ``Of course, nobody writes like Shakespeare either,'' he said.
``But, you know, it don't matter. Those things can still be
performed. They don't have to be written _ just like folk songs.''

<HEAD>Less Wheat Needed to Buy Foreign Oil, but Expert Says It Won't
Last</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It takes less Kansas wheat to buy a barrel of
Mideast oil this year, but don't bet the farm that this will last
forever, or even to the turn of the century.
   According to the Worldwatch Institute, about 4.3 bushels of
wheat are required to buy a barrel of oil, a little more than half
of the grain that was needed just three years ago.
   But over the long haul, says institute president Lester R.
Brown, the odds ``seem certain to favor the oil exporters'' because
they are dealing in a non-renewable commodity, compared with wheat,
which can be planted every year.
   ``Another surge in oil prices is likely sometime during the
early '90s,'' Brown said. ``When it comes, it will throw the terms
of trade decidedly in favor of oil exporters.''
   In his view, countries that sell grain and import oil should be
investing in automobile fuel efficiency and seeking alternatives to
the car and petroleum-based fuel.
   ``For the United States, basic policy measures such as the
imposition of a gasoline tax and the extension of auto
fuel-efficiency standards will help minimize the effect of the next
major shift in the wheat-oil exchange rate,'' Brown said.
   Worldwatch Institute, which is based in Washington, is a
private, non-profit research organization which studies global
problems, often focusing on agriculture and the food supply.
Brown's comments about wheat and oil were in the current issue of
World Watch magazine.
   ``The economic fortunes of nations rise and fall with shifts in
the exchange rate between two widely traded commodities, grain and
oil,'' Brown said.
   Grain directly supplies half of the calories the world's people
consume, and indirectly supplies part of the remainder in the form
of grain-fed meat, milk and eggs. Oil accounts for more than 40
percent of commercial energy use.
   Exports of these dominant commodities are concentrated in a
handful of countries, with grain coming mostly from North America
and oil from the Middle East.
   ``The United States, which dominates grain exports even more
than Saudi Arabia does oil, is both the world's leading grain
exporter and oil importer,'' Brown said. ``And, ironically, all 13
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
are grain importers.''
   Several trends have converged to boost grain prices, he said.
Millions of acres of U.S. farmland have been abandoned or retired
under federal programs to protect highly erodible soil. Worldwide,
the area planted in grain is shrinking at a time when food demands
are rising.
   Drought also has been a factor across much of the United States
this year, and in 1987 in the Indian subcontinent. Grain prices
have risen sharply.
   ``Oil prices, meanwhile, have remained stable, despite OPEC
attempts to raise them by urging non-member oil exporting countries
to also curb production,'' Brown said. ``As a result the wheat-oil
exchange rate has been falling somewhat during 1988.''
   In the near term, he said, the advantage to grain exporters is
providing ``a modest redress for the losses they suffered in the
volatile oil market of the '70s.''
   Brown said the 1970s ``upset the remarkably stable rate of
exchange'' that had existed between grain and oil during the third
quarter of the 20th century.
   ``In economic terms, anyone with a bushel of wheat during that
time could exchange it for a barrel of oil in the world market,''
he said.
   In 1950, Brown said, wheat was $1.91 a bushel and oil at $1.71 a
barrel, meaning that a bushel of wheat could be traded for 1.1
barrels of oil. In 1972, just a year before the first oil price
hike, a bushel of wheat and a barrel of oil were both worth exactly
$1.91.
   According to Brown's report, the world price of wheat in 1975
averaged $4.06 per bushel and oil $10.72 per barrel, meaning that
it took 2.6 bushels of wheat to buy a barrel of oil.
   ``By 1979, the year of the second oil price hike, the strength
of oil had pushed the exchange rate to roughtly 7-to-1,'' Brown
said. ``This steep rise in grain-purchasing power oil led to one of
the greatest international transfers of wealth ever recorded.''
   Brown added: ``The coffers of major oil exporters such as Saudi
Arabia began to overflow with dollars as those of many
oil-importing countries were being emptied.''
   By 1985, oil had edged to more than $30 a barrel. With the world
price of wheat at $3.70 per bushel, it took 8.1 bushels to buy a
barrel of oil.
   ``In 15 years, the terms of trade for oil-exporting countries
that import wheat had improved eightfold,'' Brown said. ``For
countries that export grain to pay for oil, it was an impoverishing
15 years.''
   Oil prices dropped by more than half from 1985 to 1986 to $14.60
per barrel, reducing the exchange rate to 6-to-1 in 1987, even
during a time of weakening grain prices.
   This year, he said, the world price of wheat may average about
$3.85 per bushel and oil around $16.50 per barrel, or 4.3 bushels
of wheat to equal a barrel of oil.
   ``During the early '70s, U.S. grain exports easily paid the
nation's oil import bill,'' Brown said. ``But the United States'
failure to wean itself from heavy dependence on this increasingly
costly commodity contributed to soaring outlays for imports, a
widening trade deficit, and mounting external debt.''

   This will be an easy quiz.
   Two television newscasts, both inspired by newspapers, make
their debut Monday. One show is based on USA Today, the other on
the Christian Science Monitor. One show will cover international
politics, the other will decide how we really feel about our bodies.
   Made the match?
   Even before they hit the air, it's obvious that ``World Monitor
TV'' and ``USA Today: The Television Show'' will take dramatically
different approaches to television news.
   _ Like the paper from which it springs, ``USA Today: The
Television Show'' will be divided into four segments: news, money,
sports and life. Each block will have its own anchor, and the
emphasis throughout will be decidedly soft.
   _ Although the news philosophy of ``World Monitor TV'' is
clearly more traditional, it looks to be the more problematic show.
In an age where ``Entertainment Tonight'' succeeds as journalism
and TV Guide is among the most-read magazines, straightforward
reporting has come to be something of a gamble.
   Still, the makers of ``World Monitor TV'' are hopeful.
Audiences, the show's creators suspect, may need a hard-news fix.
   ``People now who are addicted to information feel uninformed,''
said John Hart, the former NBC reporter who will serve as ``World
Monitor TV's'' anchor. ``I want to know what's true about things.
And I think most people do, too. If you leave people with a sense
that the world is made up of unrelated fragments, I think you miss
something. It's unbalanced.''
   ``World Monitor TV'' will be broadcast weeknights at 4 p.m. and
10 p.m. (PDT) on cable television's all-documentary Discovery
Channel, the fastest-growing cable network, with 32 million
subscriber homes.
   ``I think the Discovery Channel's audience is very compatible
with the kind of news program we want to produce,'' said Daniel
Wilson, executive producer of ``World Monitor TV.''
   The half-hour newscast, produced near the Christian Science
Monitor's headquarters in Boston, will focus on only three or four
stories each night and may remind viewers of public TV's
MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour, which uses a similar format.
   The program will not, Hart said, make any effort to declare,
``That's the way it is.''
   ``We have the luxury of not pretending to be a broadcast of
record,'' Hart said. ``We're not going to chase every wisp of
smoke. ... We are in the context business. That's our job. We can
tell you what the news means. We can make connections, relate
history. We can do the things you can't do when you're trying to
hit all the bases.
   ``We'll use reporters and foreign correspondents who know the
language and know the culture.''
   While ``World Monitor TV'' will not be a video version of its
newspaper cousin, the newscast will be supported by the Christian
Science Monitor's 22 international and domestic news bureaus. Each
broadcast will also include satellite-fed contributions from
``World Monitor TV's'' news desks in London, Tokyo and Washington.
Hodding Carter III will be the program's regular commentator.
   Don't look for ``World Monitor TV'' to break news stories on a
daily basis. That's not part of the plan, and the newscast doesn't
have the resources to support an investigative unit. ``We might do
a story on day care,'' Wilson said. ``And what we would do is look
at the issue in Europe, the Far East and America. And then we would
make comparisons. We're going to try to do things in depth.''
   It is such thoroughness that drew Hart, a 28-year network news
veteran, to ``World Monitor TV.''
   ``At the networks, the commercial considerations are first,''
Hart said. Hart, a Peabody Award-winning reporter, has also served
as host of ``NBC Saturday Night News'' and ``NBC Sunday Night
News.''
   ``This place is a relief,'' Hart continued. ``Here, we won't
make editorial decisions solely to garner an audience. ... These
people are interested in journalism. And that's it. They're not
caught in the struggle between journalism and marketing. There's
nothing wrong with marketing, but it pulls in the opposite
direction _ toward fantasy, and not toward reality. ... Here's a
show where we can deal with ideas for a change.''
   Hart calls ``World Monitor TV'' a ``modest proposal.'' He's
right. While ``USA Today: The Television Show'' has first-year
start-up costs of $40 million and a staff of 160, ``World Monitor
TV'' has been given $20 million for each of its first five years
and has just more than 100 employees. Network news budgets, for
contrast, averaged $275 million last year.
   ``USA Today: The Television Show,'' meanwhile, is banking that
U.S. viewers want ``entertaining information,'' as the newscast is
characterized by its producer Steve Friedman, formerly of NBC's
``Today.''
   Friedman's show will be broadcast through syndication, appearing
on more than 150 stations across the country.
   ``USA Today: The Television Show'' and ``World Monitor TV'' do
have one thing in common: Neither will try to be a headline
service. Each will try to complement, not compete with, the network
newscasts.
   After that, however, all similarities between the two shows end.
   Thus, if you see ``World Monitor'' looking at the developing
black middle class in Zimbabwe, expect ``USA Today: The Television
Show'' to explain how men's and women's opinions of love differ.
   Which show will be a hit? That's hard to say. USA Today, the
newspaper, has 5.4 million readers. The Christian Science Monitor's
circulation, on the other hand, is less than 200,000.
   Sometimes, though, good things come in small packages.

   Oil futures prices were mixed after a dull
session marked only by a late technical rally in the near-term
contract for unleaded gasoline.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for October
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude oil, fell 12 cents per barrel to close at $15.22 on Monday.
Most other contract months fell a similar amount.
   Near-term contracts rose for refined oil products traded on the
exchange. Contracts for September delivery of wholesale unleaded
gasoline rose 0.45 cent to 47.24 cents a gallon. Other months were
lower.
   Wholesale heating oil for September advanced 0.09 cent to 42.76
cents a gallon while longer term contracts declined.

   But traders said there was a great deal of skepticism
surrounding his efforts.
   ``People are becoming jaded because you can't get any kind of a
good move in crude on the upside,'' said Madison Galbraith, a
senior trader at Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   The official OPEC benchmark price for crude is $18 a barrel.
   Traders said the market ignored a report by The Middle East
Economic Survey, a respected oil industry newsletter published in
Nicosia, which stated that OPEC's August output totaled about 20
million barrels a day, roughly 3.5 million barrels a day over its
overall production quota.

   Gerald Tsai Jr. and Sanford I. Weill,
two long-time friends known as brilliant businessmen and ambitious
dealmakers, have forged a high-stakes alliance affecting both of
their companies and both of their futures.
   Tsai, the former wildly successful money manager who now is
chairman of Primerica Corp., and Weill, former president of
American Express Co. and current chairman of Commercial Credit
Group Inc., said Monday that Commercial Credit had agreed to
acquire Primerica in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $1.65 billion.
   The merger could create financial services company and help
Primerica, which has had problems with its 1987 acquisition of the
struggling brokerage firm Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   It also presents a challenge to Weill, who has a reputation for
going into tough situations and turning them around.
   What is unclear is what role Tsai will play in the new company.
   Tsai will be the new company's largest individual shareholder,
with about 1.5 percent of its stock, as well as a director and
chairman of the board's executive committee. Weill will be
chairman, chief executive officer and president of the combined
company.
   Both men shrugged off the role issue in a telephone interview on
Monday.
   When asked who will run the show, Tsai said, ``He (Weill)
does...I feel fine about that.''
   ``They are a terrific team. This is going to be an absolute
powerhouse company,'' said Primerica director Joseph A. Califano
Jr., former U.S. secretary of health, education and welfare.
   Califano said it was clear that Weill would run the company,
even though Tsai wasn't stepping back.
   ``Gerry Tsai is only beginning his career,'' Califano said.
``He's a man with 1,000 ideas.''
   Some analysts unsure of Tsai's role in the new company.
   ``One conclusion is that Commercial Credit will be the owner _
Sandy Weill knows the brokerage business and financial services _
and he will be the one to run the show,'' said Dudley Heer, an
analyst with the brokerage firm Duff & Phelps in Chicago.
   ``Tsai is a dealmaker,'' Heer said. ``I don't know if he has
mellowed out or what. In the investment business there is no
retirement restriction...and he is a very vibrant individual.''
   Tsai, 59, who has been chairman of Greenwich-based Primerica for
just 19 months, has surprised people before. He earned a reputation
as an investment wizard with some of his stock plays in the 1960s.
   He became involved with Primerica _ then called American Can Co.
_ in 1982 when he sold it Associated Madison, which he had acquired
earlier.
   Tsai became vice chairman in 1983 and was named chairman in
January 1987, helping shepherd the company through transformation
from a manufacturing operation to a financial services concern.
Under Tsai's direction, Primerica embarked on a strategy of
simplifying its operations and strengthening its financial position.
   Tsai said he hoped to spend a lot of time on long-range planning
and working with Weill.
   ``Sandy is somebody I have known for well over 25 years. He is a
terrific business manager. I'm very excited about this and I think
the stockholders will be very happy down the road,'' Tsai said.
   Weill, 55, a founder of what now is the giant investment firm
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., also talked about his friendship with
Tsai.
   ``I think we have always gotten along well. I don't think we'll
have any problems,'' Weill said.
   Weill also is not worried about the problems at Smith Barney,
which Primerica acquired last year for $750 million.
   Primerica attributed its flat second-quarter earnings to the
weak performance by Smith Barney, which suffered from lower trading
volume, underwriting and commission revenues in the wake of the
stock market crash.
   ``I think there is a really excellent opportunity for Smith
Barney to grow and prosper even in difficult economic
environments,'' Weill said.
   He and Tsai also denied that Smith Barney would be sold; Weill
said the firm was an ``important ingredient'' of Primerica.
   Anthony Pearce-Batten, an analyst with Legg Mason Wood Walker
Inc. in Baltimore, also said he did not believe Smith Barney would
be sold.
   ``He has built a reputation as a strong manager who is able to
turn companies around,'' Pearce-Batten said. ``Commercial Credit
appears to be in the early stages of another success and Primerica
is the next quantum leap forward.''
   ``...Weill has a good eye for a bargain, very strong management
capabilities, streamling organizations and making them more
efficent and at the same time reducing expenses,'' Pearce-Batten
said.
   Weill left American Express in 1985 after failing to become
chief executive officer. He gained control of Baltimore-based
Commercial Credit two years ago and last November was edged out by
his former firm, Shearson Lehman Brothers, in an attempt to buy
E.F. Hutton Group Inc.
   Under terms of an agreement approved by both companies' boards,
Primerica shareholders would receive one share of Commercial Credit
common stock plus $7 cash for each share of Primerica.
   Commercial Credit's stock fell 75 cents a share to close at
$24.50 on the New York Stock Exchange Monday. Primerica lost 62{
cents a share to close at $29.50 on the NYSE.

<HEAD>Coming Election Will Determine Fate Of U.S. Free Trade Deal</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has signaled the
likelihood of a fall election to decide the fate of both the
Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement and his Progressive Conservative
government.
   In a heated three-way race, the landmark vote on Canada's
economic future would offer the nation a clear choice between
conservatives, liberals and socialists.
   Mulroney said in a Canadian Broadcasting Corp. interview Sunday
night, after keeping the country guessing for weeks, that he saw no
reason to remain in office much longer than the traditional four
years without a new election.
   Those four years end on Sept. 17.
   ``I've always believed that while the Constitution allows for a
five-year term, that the custom of going about four years _ give or
take a couple of months _ is a sound one, and it's one that should
be respected,'' he said.
   An election call Sept. 17 would mean a mid-November election.
Canadian campaigns normally last about eight weeks.
   If Mulroney wins, the world's two largest trading partners will
proceed with plans to create a North American free trade zone on
Jan. 1, eliminating all tariffs over 10 years and dismantling
barriers to investment and competition.
   If he loses, both the main opposition Liberal Party and the
socialist New Democratic Party say they will tear up the complex
trade deal hailed by President Reagan as ``only a beginning'' in a
global free flow of trade.
   Mulroney, 49, a former corporate lawyer who became leader of his
party in 1983 and scored a landslide victory a year later, has been
waiting for good omens before calling an election.
   But Liberal leader John Turner forced Mulroney's hand by asking
the Liberal majority in the unelected Senate to stall free-trade
legislation indefinitely.
   Turner and New Democratic Party leader Ed Broadbent claim the
deal jeopardizes Canadian sovereignty. ``We have put in potential
jeopardy our cultural programs and our social programs and our
ability to assist our less developed regions,'' said Turner.
   The elected House of Commons began its final debate on the trade
deal Monday. With Conservatives holding 207 of the 282 seats, the
bill should pass easily on Wednesday. The Liberals have 38 seats,
New Democrats 32, with 2 Independents, 1 Liberal-Independent and 2
vacancies.
   The deal must then be passed by the Senate before becoming law.
   The government hopes that pressure from pro-free traders such as
Quebec's Liberal Premier Robert Bourassa and the western provinces
will soften the Senate's stand, especially amid calls for reform or
abolition of the chamber.
   All players will be watching the Sept. 6 provincial election in
Nova Scotia to see if Conservative Premier John Buchanan wins
another term. ``A Conservative loss could be the one event that
could force plans for an election to be put on hold,'' said
pollster Angus Reid.
   A national Reid poll last Friday gave the Conservatives 36
percent of the vote, Liberals 32 percent and New Democrats 30
percent. The latest Gallup Poll showed the Liberals with 35
percent, Conservatives 34 percent and New Democrats 30 percent.
Small parties and independents took up the remainder.
   Such a tight race could result in a minority Conservative
government lacking the votes to pass free trade.
   Historians compare the contest to the milestone election of 1911
when Liberal Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier offered free trade
but lost to Conservative Robert Borden who pledged ``No truck nor
trade with the Yankees.''
   Despite presiding over a healthy economy and negotiating an
accord to bring Quebec back into the Constitution, Mulroney has
struggled with a credibility problem referred to in the press as
the ``sleaze factor.''
   He lost eight Cabinet members in scandals ranging from tainted
tuna to criminal charges. Liberals gloated this month when a
disgruntled former Cabinet member from Quebec, Suzanne
Blais-Grenier, alleged the Mulroney government was operating ``a
network of patronage and kickbacks.''
   She gave no proof but the controversy swelled when two other
Quebec Conservatives spoke of ``crumbs'' from the procurement table
and information ``that could put a dozen people in jail,'' again
without hard evidence.
   The other parties have their problems, too.
   Polls show Turner the most unpopular party leader, with only 15
percent voter approval. He has struggled for two years to even hold
onto his job in a divided party and is embarrassed by Bourassa's
close links with Mulroney, whose government has pumped money into
Quebec.
   Nearly two-thirds of voters say they like Ed Broadbent, a former
university teacher who claims to speak for ``ordinary Canadians.''
But his popularity may not translate into support for a left-wing
party that has never governed Canada and is committed to NATO
withdrawal and protectionism.

<HEAD>Analysis Of Five Pesticides Chavez Wants Banned</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report and on general news wires.</NOTE>

   One of the five pesticides the United Farm
Workers union wants banned from table grapes is already outlawed
and the federal Environmental Protection Agency is keeping a wary
eye on three others.
   But state officials say the fifth chemical on the list is safe
on crops, although it has killed people when used to fumigate
houses.
   The thrust of the union's message during leader Cesar Chavez's
36-day fast centered on alleged dangers the five pesticides pose
for table grape workers, including risks of cancer, but the union
also contends they threaten consumers and the environment.
   Chavez was reported Monday recuperating with no sign of
long-term ill effects from the fast he ended Aug. 21. Other
activists have continued the fast for three days at a time; the
latest was actor Martin Sheen.
   Union board member Arturo Rodriguez claimed some grocers removed
table grapes from their shelves as word of the fast spread, but
several growers and chain grocers said the fast had no noticeable
effect on overall sales of the crop.
   ``The chemicals he (Chavez) is talking about on that list are
not very valid in terms of farm worker hazards,'' said Jim Wells,
chief of pesticide enforcement for the state Department of Food and
Agriculture.
   The chemicals are Dinoseb, a weed killer; Captan, used to
control mold and fungus; methyl bromide, used to kill soil insects
and worms; and Phosdrin and Parathion, both used to kill insects.
   California banned Dinoseb in 1986 because it has caused birth
defects, sterility and other disorders in test animals. The union
started its campaign against the chemicals before the state action
and never removed Dinoseb from its list.
   The EPA has Captan, Posdrin and Parathion under special review
because of possible danger.
   Captan has been banned in West Germany, and Canada has greatly
restricted residue levels allowed on imported produce, said Dr.
Keith Maddy, chief state Food and Agriculture toxicologist.
Parathion has been banned ``in a number of countries,'' including
Japan.
   But methyl bromide seems to be a different story.
   UFW consultant Dr. Marion Moses told a reporter that ``there
have been more worker deaths, occupational deaths, related to
methyl bromide than any other single pesticide.''
   But Wells said all methyl bromide deaths he was aware of
involved people entering houses under fumigation. He said there
have been no farm worker or applicator deaths, and grape pickers do
not come in contact with methyl bromide because it's used to
fumigate soil before grapevines are planted.
   ``A small amount can cause lung, liver or kidney damage, or it
can kill you if you get a strong enough whiff of it,'' said Al
Heier, an Environmental Protection Agency spokesman in Washington.
   More than 10 million pounds of the pesticide were used in
California in 1986, but over half was used to fumigate buildings,
according to state records.
   There are concerns about Captan, a fungicide under special
review by the EPA since 1980. It doesn't cause immediate sickness
but is being studied as a long-term threat, Wells said.
   ``It causes tumors in animals, and we have proposed to ban all
uses because of dietary exposure,'' said Heier of the EPA.
   Captan residue has been found on 32 of 344 samples of produce
tested for that pesticide by the state Food and Agriculture
Department. The residues were well below federal tolerance levels
designed to protect consumers, but the Natural Resources Defense
Council claims any Captan residue is a potential threat because it
is carcinogenic.
   Maddy, the state toxicologist, said federal tests give animals
such high doses of pesticides that most chemicals show a positive
cancer response.
   Banning Captan could allow certain fungi to thrive on produce,
which in turn could be toxic or cancer-causing to consumers, Maddy
said.
   Maddy said Phosdrin is under special EPA review for its acute
toxicity, or potential to rapidly cause sickness.
   ``We have very little chronic (health effects) data on
Phosdrin,'' said Heier. The state reported 273,874 pounds of
Phosdrin, also known as Mevinphos, were used in 1986.
   He said EPA has Parathion under special review because of
``possible nerve damage and eye damage to test animals.''
   Rex Magee, a Food and Agriculture spokesman, said that to his
knowledge no farm workers in California have died because of
pesticides, a statement the union strongly disputes.
   State records show that from 1982 to 1986, there were 90 cases
of systemic or internal poisonings from all uses of Parathion, 58
Phosdrin cases and 32 methyl bromide cases. During the same period,
grape pickers suffered 36 cases of topical poisonings, such as a
rash, from Captan when used with other chemicals.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices were sharply lower at midday Tuesday
on the London Stock Exchange, as participants returned from a
three-day holiday weekend with unabated worries about the British
trade deficit and interest rates.
   Trading was light, as institutional players awaited further
signals on the British economy, dealers said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 21.0
points, or 3.7 percent, at 1749.7 at 12:30 p.m. local time. The
index opened just 4.6 points lower and plunged to a low of 1745.2,
or 25.5 points down, at late morning.
   ``One is watching the market quite carefully,'' said Brennan
Hiorns, a stock analyst at Kleinwort Grieveson Securities. ``Fund
managers in (Britain) still haven't taken any strategic decisions
yet.''
   Triggering the worries were last week's British trade figures,
which showed a record deficit of 2 billion pounds, or about $3.6
billion, on the current account in July.
   A subsequent increase in banks' base lending rates to 12 percent
from 11 percent left the market speculating that further rate hikes
might be necessary to cool Britain's consumer spending boom.

<TEXT>
   The government said today its chief
forecasting gauge of future economic activity dropped 0.8 percent
in July, the sharpest decline in eight months.
   Economists said the drop in the Commerce Department's Index of
Leading Economic Indicators may be a signal of a pause in what has
been booming economic growth this year. But they cautioned against
reading too much into a single month's figures.
   The July decline was the biggest since last November, when the
index dropped 1.0 percent in the wake of the October stock market
crash.
   The latest drop was likely to be seen as good news by the stock
and bond markets, which have faltered in recent weeks on fears that
inflation is heating up.
   But the dip follows a 1.4 percent jump in the index in June, the
biggest increase in 18 months. The Commerce Department revised its
estimate for May, calculating now that the indicators were off by
0.7 percent instead of the previously reported 0.8 percent.
   The government said last week that the U.S. economy, as measured
by the gross national product, grew at an annual rate of 3.3
percent in the April-June quarter, following a 3.4 percent
expansion pace in the first three months of the year.
   This strong growth has raised concern at the Federal Reserve
Board, which is charged with keeping inflation under control.
   The Fed has been pusing up short-term interest rates since late
March in an attempt to slow growth to a sustainable,
non-inflationary pace. On Aug. 9, it took its most dramatic
inflation-fighting move by raising the discount rate, its key bank
lending rate, by a half percentage point.
   Since then, analysts have been watching government economic
statistics closely for indications of whether the Fed has tigtened
enough.
   In July, the weakness in the leading indicators was widespread,
with seven of the available nine components registering declines.
   The biggest drain came from an 11.3 percent jump in unemployment
claims. That was followed in order of severity by a drop in new
orders for consumer goods; a decline in building permits; a speedup
in business deliveries, considered a sign of slackening demand; a
drop in the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, a contraction of
the money supply and a drop in plant and equipment orders.
   One indicator, a rise in prices for raw materials, was read as a
sign of economic strength. The length of the average workweek was
unchanged in July.
   The 0.8 percent overall decline left the index at 192.1 percent
of its 1967 base of 100.

   Michael Evans, a private economic forecaster in Washington, said
he expected GNP growth likely will slow to an annual rate of 2.5
percent in the second half, closer to what the Federal Reserve
considers sustainable without quickening inflaton.
   He said growth in U.S. exports and increases in investment
spending by businesses likely would slow from the torrid pace
earlier this year. Also, higher interest rates are already
beginning to pinch the housing industry.
   However, David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Co.,
a government securities dealer in New York, said the momentum of
the economy will keep growth strong until at least the second half
of next year.
   ``I really think we'll see just a temporary slowing. My own
feeling is economic growth in the second half will continue at
about the same pace as the first half,'' he said.
   ``My own guess is that there will have to be some more Fed
tightening and still higher interest rates. But most of that upward
pressure will come after the election and we'll see a pause for a
while,'' he said.
   Economists cautioned against drawing firm conclusions from the
leading index until a clear pattern emerges over three months.
   Since it was created in 1948, the index has fallen three months
in a row a total of 12 times. In eight of those instances, a
recession followed. The other four times, economic growth slowed,
but there was no recession.
   The index last declined three consecutive months from June
through August in 1984. There was no recession, but the economy did
enter a two-year period of slow growth.
   Also, initial estimates of the index are frequently revised
substantially in later months.
   For instance, within the last year, there were preliminary
reports of declines for five consecutive months _ from September
through January. However, later revisions wiped out all but two of
those drops, in November and January.

<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM (AP) _ Distributors in St. Louis, Phoenix and
Tucson will be the first to test-market a new smokeless cigarette
developed by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., company officials said
today.
   Betsy Annese, director of public relations for the
Winston-Salem-based company, said the three cities were chosen as
lead markets for the new cigarettes, called Premier, because they
have ``the right mix of retail outlets and a very good
distributorship network.''
   ``From Oct. 1 to Oct. 15 they'll be sold just like any other
cigarette,'' she said, adding that the price per pack will be about
30 cents higher than normal cigarettes.
   The company will use a variety of advertising messages, she
said. One of them will tout the new product as ``Premier _ the
Cleaner Smoke.''
   But the company is not making any health or safety claims.
   ``We're not claiming this is a safe or safer cigarette,'' she
said.
   Company officials say the new cigarettes contain a high-tech
packet of tobacco extracts, which is heated, but not burned. The
result is a cigarette without odor and only a trace of ash or
environmental smoke that could irritate people nearby.

<HEAD>Mark IV Files Suit In Its Bid For Armtek</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mark IV Industries Inc. has filed suit
against Armtek Corp. in its $500 million hostile bid for the New
Haven-based auto parts maker.
   The suit, filed Monday in Delaware Court of Chancery, charges
that Armtek's board misued a variety of anti-takeover measures in
order to prevent its shareholders from determining whether they
want to accept Mark IV's $44-a-share cash tender offer.
   Mark IV has asked the court to order Armtek not to implement
anti-takeover measures.
   John N. Sievers, Armtek vice president of coporate planning and
investor relations, declined comment.
   In a lawsuit filed earlier this month in New Haven federal
court, Armtek accused Mark IV, a holding company based in West
Amherst, N.Y., of violating disclosure requirments of federal
securities laws. The suit seeks injunctions barring Mark IV from
purchasing Armtek stock or seeking control of the company.
   According to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Armtek
has set Sept. 1 as the date by which it will exercise its ``poison
pill'' or shareholders' rights agreement.
   Under the plan, the company would distribute a new series of
preferred stock. The new stock can be converted into cash at a
premium rate, raising the cost of an acquisition in an effort to
deter hostile bidders.
   Formerly the Armstrong Rubber Co., Armtek makes plastics and
specialty chemicals used in the automotive and other industries.

   The government said today its chief forecasting gauge of future
economic activity dropped 0.8 percent in July, the sharpest decline
in eight months, while orders to U.S. factories fell a steep 3.5
percent.
   Economists said the drop in the Commerce Department's Index of
Leading Economic Indicators may be a signal of a pause in what has
been booming economic growth this year. But they cautioned against
reading too much into a single month's figures.
   The July decline was the biggest since last November, when the
index dropped 1.0 percent in the wake of the October stock market
crash.
   Orders for manufactured goods, which registered their steepest
decrease in 18 months, were dragged down by a sharp decline in
military orders, the department said.
   Orders for both durable and non-durable goods fell $7.9 billion
last month to $220.2 billion. But the decline, the worst since a
3.6 percent drop in January 1987, had been anticipated.
   In a revision of the previous month's figure, the government
said orders rose 5.4 percent in June, the largest monthly increase
in more than 17 years.
   Both the stock and bond markets reacted cooly to the latest
hints that the economy may be slowing. The Treasury's long bond was
little changed, while trading was mixed on Wall Street.
   Separately, a government report released Monday showed a big
drop in new-home sales last month in the face of higher mortgage
rates.
   The departments of Commerce and Housing and Urban Development
said sales of new single-family homes fell 4.7 percent in July to a
seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 686,000 units. It was the
biggest decline since a 6.2 percent decline in December.
   The government also reduced estimates for June and May, showing
less housing strength than previously believed.
   Fixed-rate mortgages have risen by almost a point since March to
their highest levels of the year, boosting the monthly payment on a
new $100,000 mortgage by about $65.
   But the housing report was well received by traders in the bond
market, which has been languishing because of fears of inflation
and higher interest rates.
   Bond prices posted the biggest gain in nearly four weeks,
although trading was light. Brokers said lower commodity prices and
a higher-valued dollar also played roles in the rally.
   The Treasury's key 30-year bond climbed nearly $10 per $1,000
face amount, its biggest one-day gain since Aug. 2. Its yield,
which moves in the opposite direction from price, fell to 9.33
percent from 9.43 percent late Friday.
   The bond rally also helped Wall Street, which has been sensitive
to rising interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
which had bounced around last week to post a net gain of 1.43
points, rose 24.00 to 2,041.43.

   Multimillionaire commodities trader Richard J.
Dennis, a legend whose luck turned sour after last October's stock
market collapse, says he is leaving the futures business to
concentrate on his other passion: politics.
   Dennis, 39, known as the ``Prince of the Pit'' at Chicago's
boisterous commodities exchanges, said Monday he was closing his
accounts and selling his exchange seats so he could devote his
energies to ``public policy and political endeavors.''
   ``There is only so much satisfaction and utility to the making
of money,'' Dennis said in a prepared statement.
   He said he would use his personal fortune, reportedly around
$200 million, as a launching pad for his new career.
   ``I am fortunate to have enough assets and opportunities to try
to make a significant impact on our political lives. As I approach
40 years of age, I believe it is time for me to take on this new
set of challenges,'' the statement read.
   Dennis said he would concentrate on writing, speaking and
``active involvement with voters and candidates.''
   He was national co-chairman for the unsuccessful Democratic
presidential campaign of former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt. He also
has made sizable contributions to several other Democratic
campaigns since 1980, including the 1984 presidential bid of former
Vice President Walter Mondale and the 1986 Illinois gubernatorial
campaign of Adlai Stevenson.
   Dennis said he now supports the presidential bid of Democratic
nominee Michael Dukakis and has contributed $100,000 to his
campaign.
   Babbitt believes Dennis could have a large and lasting impact on
the Democratic Party.
   ```His primary concern is the power of ideas,'' Babbitt said.
``He wants to force the Democratic Party to rethink its agenda. He
has a passion for economic reform.''
   Dennis also donated $10 million to establish the Roosevelt
Center, a liberal think-tank with offices in Washington and
Chicago, and is a leading financial backer of People for the
American Way, a liberal group formed as a counterpoint to the
conservative Moral Majority.
   Dennis, a native of Chicago's South Side, began his financial
career at age 17 as a $1.60-an-hour brokerage house runner at the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   After graduating from DePaul University with a degree in
philosophy, he bought his first exchange seat _ on the tiny
MidAmerica Commodity Exchange _ at age 21.
   Dennis owns seats on every major commodity exchange and runs two
companies: C&D Commodities, a futures trading partnership of which
he is managing partner, and Richard J. Dennis & Co., an advising
firm for managed futures funds and accounts.
   His uncanny success as a trader earned him the nickname ``Prince
of the Pit'' on the floors of the Chicago Board of Trade and
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. But his fortune seemed to sour after
last October's markets collapse, in which C&D Commodities
reportedly lost $10 million.
   Two public commodity funds Dennis launched last year in
conjunction with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. also fell on hard
times. After they lost more than 50 percent of their $115 million
combined initial value, Dennis suspended trading last April in the
funds.
   Both funds resumed trading on Aug. 3 following a vote of
confidence by investors, and each had lost about 3.5 percent when
trading was halted for good on Friday, said Mark Walsh, a Dennis &
Co. spokeman.
   Walsh blamed the losses on ``choppy markets _ the worst markets
we've seen in 10 years.''
   He said Dennis' decision to quit trading was not related to the
funds' losses.
   Several veteran traders on the floor of the Chicago Board of
Trade said Dennis' exit from the futures business had been expected.
   ``I know that for the last several years, his main interest in
life has been politics, not trading,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a
trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``He is certainly one of biggest, most successful traders
ever,'' Lespinasse said. ``Over the past year he supposedly had
some rough times but overall he made a lot of money and was very,
very succesful.''
   ``I personally was surprised he stayed around so long,'' added
Jerry Zusel, manager of CBOT floor operations for Balfour Maclaine
Corp.
   ``With the fact that he's made so much money, I couldn't
understand why he'd want to keep risking capital,'' Zusel said.
``As one guy said to me this morning, he's made more money than he
could spend in 10 lifetimes.''

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ A new smokeless cigarette developed
by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. will be test-marketed in St. Louis,
Phoenix and Tucson, Ariz., beginning Oct. 1, company officials said
today.
   The new cigarettes, called Premier, will be odorless and will
generate only a trace of ash or smoke that could irritate people
nearby, the officials said.
   Company officials said the new cigarettes contain a high-tech
packet of tobacco extracts which is heated, but not burned.
   The price per pack will be about 30 cents higher than other
cigarettes, said Betsy Annese, director of public relations for the
Winston-Salem-based company.
   The company will use a variety of advertising messages to sell
the new cigarettes, she said; one advertising approach will tout
the new product as ``Premier _ the Cleaner Smoke.''
   But the company is not making any health or safety claims.
   ``We're not claiming this is a safe or safer cigarette,'' she
said.
   A health claim would invite regulation by the Federal Food and
Drug Administration.
   ``If a product is sold with claims to make cigarettes safer, it
is a medical device'' subject to FDA approval, said William Grigg,
an FDA spokesman.
   Anti-smoking groups are pressing the FDA to regulate the new
cigarettes as a drug because, they maintain, Reynolds is making
implied health claims for its product. In addition, the
anti-smoking groups say the new cigarettes could appeal to
teen-agers, thereby gaining a new generation of smokers as
customers.
   Analysts said Reynolds selected the test markets, in particular
the Arizona cities, because they have numerous older, sophisticated
smokers who may be trying to quit smoking or are seeking an
alternative.

<HEAD>Report Congress Probing 30 Firms in Swiss Insider Inquiry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional investigators have uncovered
evidence suggesting that up to 30 Wall Street firms unwittingly
participated in an insider trading scheme conducted via a Swiss
brokerage, an industry publication says.
   The Aug. 29 edition of Investment Dealers' Digest says the House
Energy and Commerce committee's oversight and investigations
subcommittee will hold a hearing Sept. 8 and reveal the findings,
which indicate the Wall Street firms failed to detect suspicious
trades coming from the Ellis A.G. brokerage.
   The weekly publication said the questionable trades covered as
many as 100 takeover deals from 1982 to 1985.
   Under Swiss bank secrecy laws, trades executed by a Swiss
banking firm through other entities, such as U.S. investment firms,
don't have to be identified. This means someone holding an account
through a Swiss firm can trade through the U.S. markets without
fear of detection.
   The Investment Dealers Digest quoted unidentified congressional
aides as saying that in some cases, large trades from A.G. Ellis
were spread out over a range of Wall Street firms in order to make
the transactions less obvious.
   It said the repeated pattern of stock trades up to and during a
takeover attempt, however, prompted congressional suspicion of
insider trading, the misuse of confidential information, such as
impending takeovers, to profit in the securities markets.
   The subcommittee has been looking for evidence that the
surveillance systems of Wall Street firms are inadequate, which
some lawmakers say justify legislation that would increase firm
liability in insider trading cases.
   Ellis has been the focus of U.S. and Swiss law enforcement
investigations for months, though no action has been brought so far
and the sources behind the questionable trades haven't been
determined.
   The congressional probe was prompted partly by testimony from
convicted insider trader Dennis B. Levine, who traded through Bank
Leu, a Swiss bank, as a way to hide his activities.

   Grain and soybean futures opened slightly higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade in a continuation of Monday's
late surge, analysts said.
   Further support stemmed from a slight pickup in export business
but analysts expected the grain markets to remain in a pre-harvest
lull.
   The corn and soybean crops are past their most critical growth
stages and maturing rapidly, said Cathy Leow, an assistant vice
president in the grain futures trading division of Thomson McKinnon
Securities Inc. in New York.
   ``Nothing really can happen to the crops at this point unless we
have a frost immediately,'' she said. ``Typically, it's pretty
quiet before the harvest.''
   The Midwestern corn harvest has just begun and will get into
full swing in another two to three weeks, while soybean harvesting
will peak near the end of September, she said.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent to 3 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.88{ a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 2 cents higher with September at $2.74{ a bushel; oats
were } cent to 3{ cents higher with September at $2.52{ a bushel;
soybeans were 2 cents to 4 cents higher with September at $8.28 a

   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .03 cent to .55 cent lower with October at
72.72 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .35 cent to .70 cent lower
with September at 81.90 cents a pound; hogs were .70 cent lower to
.07 cent higher with October at 39.30 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .55 cent to 1.67 cents lower with February at 51.15

   Pressured by dissatisfied

today to oust its chairman and chief executive officer, Walter L.
Weisman.
   Royce Diener, a director and former chief executive officer, was
to be named as an interim replacement, the company said Monday.
   A committee of non-management directors called for Weisman's
resignation after the company's four largest stockholders objected
to an earlier recommendation that Weisman keep his job, the company
said.
   The hospital company has been selling underperforming hospitals
and cutting staff in an attempt to boost its earnings.
   Troubled, as is much of the industry, by rising costs, the
company in May announced it had agreed to sell 37 hospitals in 10
states for $910 million. It retains 48 hospitals and five
psychiatric hospitals in the United States and 22 hospitals and
three psychiatric hospitals overseas.

<HEAD>Jury Awards Rawson $23.6 Milliion From Prudential-Bache</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rawson Food Stores Inc. and its owner
have been awarded $23.6 million in damages in a civil suit accusing
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. of issuing bad advice on Rawson's
1985 purchase of part of the Pantry Pride supermaket chain.
   A Circuit Court jury of five women and one man deliberated for
three hours Monday before awarding owner John V. Rawson Jr. $2
million in compensatory and punitive damages and the company $21.6
million.
   The lawsuit alleged that Prudential-Bache had recklessly advised
Rawson and his company to buy 43 Northeast Florida and Southeast
Georgia stores from Pantry Pride Enterprises Inc. for $40 million.
Prudential-Bache charged $1 million for its services.
   The lawsuit said the real value of the stores was much less than
what Prudential-Bache claimed it was.
   Rawson Food Services filed for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in February 1986. The
45-store chain claimed assets of $44.6 million and liabilities of
$51 million.
   ``We are obviously very pleased with the verdict because it
means the remaining creditors of the estate can be repaid,'' said
Steve Busey, an attorney representing Raswon.
   The day it filed for reorganization, Rawson agreed to sell 33 of
its Minneapolis-based Super Valu Stores for $31.2 million. Super
Valu then sold the stores to Winn-Dixie Stores Inc.
   The remaining stores were sold to other companies but it left
Rawson $15 million too short to pay off its creditors.
   Prudential-Bache had argued it was not liable for damages
because its advise was based largely on information from Rawson's
management team.
   Attorney Mattox Hair, who represented Prudential-Bache, was out
of the office Tuesday and was unavailable for comment.

<HEAD>TWA Flight Attendants Ask DOT to Investigate Icahn's Fitness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARJORIE ANDERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The flight attendants union at Trans World
Airlines Inc. charged today that TWA's future and the safety of the
flying public are jeopardized by financier Carl Icahn's proposal to
take the airline private.
   The flight attendants asked the Department of Transportation to
investigate Icahn's fitness to continue operating TWA.
   ``TWA is being managed today not as an air carrier but as an
unsupervised mutual fund benefiting Mr. Icahn,'' Vicki Frankovich,
president of the Independent Federation of Flight Attendants, told
a news conference.
   The IFFA represents about 9,000 flight attendants at TWA.
   The union charged that since Icahn took control of TWA two years
ago, he has ``milked'' the airline's cash reserves and sold off
assets to finance his stock market and takeover ventures, instead
of buying new airplanes and safety equipment for the TWA fleet. The
airline's fleet is one of the oldest in the U.S. industry, with
planes averaging 13.3 years old.
   TWA plans to spend just over 1 percent of its budget this year
on new planes, while most other major airlines usually invest about
15 percent or 20 percent in new equipment, according to union
lawyer David Aronofsky.
   This, the union says, contributes to high maintenance costs and
TWA's accident and incident rate, which according to the Federal
Aviation Administration is the worst among major U.S. carriers.
   Icahn is asking TWA shareholders at a meeting Sept. 7 to sell
their stock to him. The purchase would be financed by the sale of
speculative, high-yield bonds, which the union says would raise
TWA's annual interest payments to $466 million, almost double the
airline's 1987 operating earnings of $240 million.
   TWA referred all questions to Bob Allen, senior vice president
for employee relations. He declined immediate comment, saying he
had not had time to study the news release.
   The union also has asked the Department of Transportation to
freeze TWA's assets while it investigates Icahn's management.
   The TWA machinists union, which also opposes the privatization
and filed suit in federal court last week in an effort to stop it,
is being asked to join the IFFA petition but has not yet had time
to study it, Frankovich said.
   ``We couldn't wait,'' she said, adding that she expects the
machinists to join the flight attendants in asking the DOT to stop
Icahn's privatization effort.
   Unions at Eastern Airlines made a similar request to the DOT
last year. In its findings the DOT said acrimonious relations
between labor and management could lead to operational problems,
and a former Secretary of Labor was appointed to act as a mediator.

<HEAD>Black Exec Crowns Meteoric Rise With New Position At Navistar</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roy S. Roberts rode a rising star through General
Motors Corp., flying through management ranks in an 11-year stint
that he ended as the highest-ranking black officer at the dowager
of American manufacturing.
   He resigned Aug. 1 with his star still rising to take over the
$3 billion truck division at Navistar International Corp. with the
job of making a good operation better.
   Roberts, 49, is bringing to North America's leading maker of
medium- and heavy-duty trucks his reputation as ``a very dynamic
leader, accepted within all ranks,'' said spokesman John D.
McDonald.
   ``We're happy to have him,'' McDonald said of Roberts, who
joined Navistar Aug. 8. ``He has a strong background in
manufacturing, and certainly with ... people. He has some very
strong leadership capabilities and a competitive spirit.''
   Navistar declined to make Roberts available for comment, ``until
he gets ... his feet on the ground,'' said spokesman Bill Greenhill.
   As he departed, Roberts got an official blessing from GM.
   ``Roy Roberts has been a valued executive and an outstanding
contributor in every assignment throughout his General Motors
career,'' said Roger B. Smith, GM chairman and chief executive
officer. ``We wish him the best in his new position at Navistar.''
   With $4 billion in annual sales, Navistar is enjoying its third
straight profitable year, after six money-losers stemming from
recession, labor troubles and the farm crisis of the early 1980s.
   The company's truck division is the leader in North America, and
Roberts' job will be ``to expand or strengthen that leadership
position,'' McDonald said. ``He is not taking over in a `back'
position.''
   Navistar plucked Roberts from possible contention as GM's first
minority chief operating officer, luring him with cash and stock
valued at about $400,000, plus an annual salary estimated at nearly
$440,000, McDonald ackowledged.
   Roberts, who was vice president of personnel administration and
development for GM, is in charge of engineering, manufacturing and
marketing of medium- and heavy-duty trucks for Navistar, formerly
International Harvester.
   His record for inspiring loyalty among employees while keeping
operations competitive is among his chief assets, McDonald said.
   Roberts faced perhaps his greatest challenge at GM when he had
to lay off 40,000 white-collar workers, 25 percent of the company's
salaried employees.
   ``If anyone thinks it's fun to ask anyone to leave General
Motors, it's not fun. It's not fun,'' Roberts told USA Today
recently.
   It was employee loyalty to Roberts that caught the eye of a
superior and served as a catalyst to his meteoric rise, according
to a recent interview in the Chicago Tribune.
   Elmer Johnson, then a GM executive vice president, said he was
inspecting the plant that Roberts managed in Tarrytown, N.Y., when
Roberts introduced him to about 70 employees, the newspaper
reported.
   ``I looked at the faces of the employees as he spoke, and you
could tell that they loved him and that they loved working for
him,'' Johnson was quoted as saying.
   At Tarrytown, Roberts is credited with saving the plant from
shutdown by winning the nod to build GM's plastic-body minivan.
   ``He's a very inspirational man, full of warmth and humor. I was
moved by his abilities,'' said Johnson, who remembered Roberts a
year later when the post of vice president of personnel fell vacant.
   John E. Jacob, president of the National Urban League, said
Roberts ``is the ideal role model for young people of all races.
Not only has he shown steady growth throughout his career, he has
evidenced that hard work has its rewards.
   ``He has further shown that one can be aggressive and committed
to civil rights and still succeed in corporate America,'' Jacob
said in a recent statement, noting that Roberts has maintained an
active involvement in the Urban League and NAACP.
   At the Urban League's national conference in Detroit earlier
this month, Roberts gave two talks, including one on the importance
of education.
   ``He's also one of the nicest people you'll ever want to meet,''
said Urban League spokeswoman Janet Dewart.
   One of 10 children born to a family in Magnolia, Ark., Roberts'
mother died when he was 2 and his father moved the family to
Michigan, where Roberts began his career on the factory floor at
Grand Rapids auto parts supplier Lear Siegler Inc. in 1959.
   He worked nights so he could go to school and earn a business
administration degree while also supporting a family.
   Roberts joined GM as director of education and training at the
diesel equipment division in 1977, took over Tarrytown in 1985 and
became vice president in 1987, skipping half a dozen management
levels.

Chrysler Corp. Lutz remains chairman of Chrysler Motors and a
member of the corporation's board.
   Stallkamp joined Chrysler Motors in 1980 as a general purchasing

marketing and procurement.
   Farmer succeeds Lee H. Runk, who resigned Monday to become
president of the St. Louis-based Harvard Industries, an auto parts

   Farmer has been with Chrysler for 20 years and has held a number
of managerial positions. He most recently was general plants
manager for car and truck assembly operations.
   Acustar, created last year as Chrysler spun off its parts
operations, employs about 28,000 hourly and salaried personnel and
runs 30 factories nationwide.

   A pinhead-sized aphid is giving new meaning
to the words ``Russian menace'' as Midwestern farmers scout their
fields for the insect.
   Leroy Brooks, a Kansas State University entomologist, says the
Russian wheat aphid is a crop pest that has been spreading since
its discovery in Russia around 1900. It was in South Africa in
1978, Mexico by the early 1980s and crossed into the United States
in Texas in 1985 or 1986.
   ``It's relatively rare to find a pest that is a completely new
pest to the United States, or in this case, the western
hemisphere,'' Brooks said.
   Kansas fields first were infested in April 1986. During 1988, at
least 49 central and western counties were affected. As of July,
the insect had spread almost to the Candian border and had been
spotted in 14 states including California and Washington.
   Entomologists estimate the Russian wheat aphid has cost U.S.
small grains growers more than $100 million in insecticides and
lost yields.
   Figures for the 1988 crop aren't yet available, nor are
projections estimating the aphid problems the new crop might face.
But in 1987, about 38 percent, or about 4 million acres, of Kansas
wheat crop was affected, Brooks said.
   Infestation levels were even higher elsewhere. New Mexico and
Colorado officials said all of their small grains crops were
infested to varying degrees during 1987. In Nebraska, infestation
was 64 percent and in Texas, 56 percent.
   In some cases, the aphids are present in enough numbers to kill
plants, he said. Usually, their impact is on yields, turning
potentially high yield fields into riskier ventures.
   The aphid also helps provide shelter for another pest, the
greenbug. When Russian heat aphids attack wheat plant leaves, the
leaves roll up. Greenbugs like the protection this affords and
appear to use it for development, allowing them to attack in higher
numbers, he said.
   Greenbugs and Russian wheat aphids are similar in appearance,
Brooks said. The aphids have a more spindle-like body and don't
carry the dark stripe common to greenbugs. The aphid also doesn't
have the visible cornicles, or tailpipes, the greenbug has, he said.
   The first signs of Russian wheat aphid trouble come when plants
begin to show a green and white streaked appearance on the upper
side of their leaves, Brooks said. Damaged plants have a pink or
purple cast to the undersides of their leaves, he said.
   Driving by a field isn't a good way to survey it for the aphids,
nor is just checking the edges only.
   ``It is only when you get down on your hands and knees a ways
into a field and start looking plant by plant and tiller by tiller
that you can detect these early signs,'' Brooks said.
   He recommends checking about 20 consecutive plants and then
doing the same at about five other spots in the field.
   Sometimes, wheat streak mosaic and other diseases or pests may
mask the presence of the aphids, he said.
   Potential yields have to be taken into account when deciding
whether to hire an aerial sprayer to apply insecticide for around
$8 an acre.
   Volunteer wheat, which often sprouts after a harvest, and
natural grasses make good hosts for the pests before they can prey
on young planted wheat in early fall and early spring, Brooks said.
Volunteer, which also can spread other pests and diseases, should
be controlled to help eliminate problems.
   Some experts are recommending late-fall planting because
early-planted wheat and small grains seem to suffer the worst aphid
infestations.
   ``We really don't have any good documented evidence on just how
important that is right now,'' Brooks said.
   Entomologists fear the aphids could develop a tolerance to some
of the insecticides now being used.
   ``Just a slight increase in tolerance could mean the difference
between successful control and not being able to get control at
all,'' Brooks said.
   Insecticide manufacturers are developing new chemicals that can
replace those currently used if tolerance becomes a problem.
   Also, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is conducting a study
involving the importation of beneficial insects to control the
aphid. Insects are being transported from Russia and Afghanistan
for the research work.

<TEXT>
   When he was just barely a teen-ager, Gary
E. Hoover decided he wanted to add a chapter to the book of
retailing.
   By 1982, armed with an economics degree and experience as a Wall
Street analyst and department store executive, he was ready to
start writing.
   Hoover, then 31, opened his first Bookstop store in the Texas
capital, modeling it loosely on the successful Toys R Us design _
big selection and discount prices. A book ``superstore,'' he called
it.
   Six years later, the Bookstop chain has grown to 17 stores _
with three more scheduled to open by year's end _ in Texas, Florida
and Louisiana. And the Bookstop founder and chairman says
confidently that there will be more to the story.
   ``I decided when I was, like 13 years old, that someday I was
going to start a chain of stores. Everything I've done since then
was toward that goal,'' he said.
   But if your idea of a bookstore is a small, musty, dark-paneled
place awash in pipe smoke, Bookstop stores might come as a shock.
   The company says its average store covers 9,500 square feet and
stocks 35,000 titles in 300 subject areas.
   Hoover is an architecture buff, and the stores have moved into
some unusual sites, including Houston's art-deco Alabama movie
theater. The store being opened in New Orleans will be located in a
100-year-old cotton warehouse.
   ``We've got the flexibility to do those things _ old cafeterias,
old roller-skating rinks, old theaters,'' he said. ``I'd love to be
in an old bank, too.''
   Bookstops are open 12 hours a day or more, some closing only two
days a year. They offer discounts of 10 percent on most titles, 25
percent on bestsellers and up to 40 percent for customers who
annually purchase ``Readers Choice'' cards. The company counts more
than 200,000 cardholders.
   Bookstop has centralized distribution, so books arriving at the
Austin headquarters from publishers can be inventoried, labeled
with the chain's own price tags and shipped to stores. The stores
transmit their sales results nightly by computer, making them
available the next morning so Bookstop's four buyers can see what's
selling.
   ``With a superstore like ours, to break even, our annual sales
volume's got to be three, four times the sales of the average
bookstore. It's a much harder thing to do, to carry that big a
selection. We need an advanced computer system, real sophisticated
inventory control systems, and yet we try to do it all at a
discount,'' Hoover said, adding that Bookstop moved 4.5 million
volumes through its distribution center last year.
   ``Retailing's always been an intensely competitive business. But
it's becoming a much more technological business. Our survival
depends much more on research, on understanding the customer, on
computerized controls,'' he said.
   The privately held company doesn't make public sales figures,
although Hoover has said in the past that 1986 sales were $26
million. In 1985, the chain grew from six stores to 12 in 105 days.
   The company's founder got his start with an economics degree
from the University of Chicago. He was a retailing analyst with
Citibank in New York and worked for department store companies in
Dallas and St. Louis. He says he spent seven years working on his
Bookstop business plan before raising the money to open the first
store.
   Hoover readily credits the Toys R Us stores with the concept. He
voices a strong belief that discount specialty stores will be among
retailing's big winners between now and the end of the century. He
cites such companies as Drug Emporium Inc., Sound Warehouse, and
new superstores in office supplies and sporting goods.
   ``Books is one of the fastest-growing categories of retailing
... That demand ties to the baby boom, because baby boomers are
getting richer every day, their incomes are rising as a group, and
they're really oriented toward buying books, continuing
self-education, and now buying their children books,'' Hoover said.
   Although other bookstore chains already were major national
forces, Hoover said he didn't encounter too much skepticism when he
approached investors with his idea of another.
   ``Books have survived the introduction of radio, the
introduction of television, the introduction of phonograph records
and movies. Books are a way of transmitting information, and
compared with other ways of transmitting information, they are
still cheap, portable, compact and readily available. We're trying
to do our part to make them more readily available,'' he said.

<HEAD>Southeast Asian Influence Will Increase In World Economy, Think
Tank Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southeast Asia's role in the world economy will
expand through the year 2000, while Japanese markets will become
more competitive and U.S. output will decline, a think tank
predicted Tuesday.
   The Research Institute on the National Economy said in a
long-range forecast that Asia's Gross National Product, or its
total output of goods and services, will rise steadily over the
next decade while those of Europe and the United States will shrink.
   Through the turn of the century, Southeast Asia's GNP will rise
5.4 points while GNP in the European Community and North America
will decline 2.9 and 2.5 points, respectively, the institute
predicted.
   Meanwhile, Japan's economy will grow at an average
inflation-adjusted pace of 4.7 percent through the year 2000, the
institute said.
   ``We have to be aware that the Japanese market will become
increasingly competitive,'' the report said. ``This is because
imports will continue to rise because of the yen's appreciation.
   ``The Japanese economy ... will be considered an extremely large
market and direct investment by foreign companies will increase,''
it added.
   The institute said it based its prediction for the economic
growth of Southeast Asia on the recent fast rise in trade among the
countries in the region, including the so-called newly
industrialized economies like South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and
Singapore as well as among members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations, including Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia.
   Steady development in the division of industrial production
between Southeast Asian countries and Japan will help avoid serious
competition among themselves, the report said.
   Economic growth of North America and the European Community has
come primarily from the effects of policies set in motion, the
report said, but the development of the Southeast Asian economy has
drawn its strength from ``autonomous economic dynamism'' itself.
   The report forecast that Japan's economic growth will be powered
by personal spending and private-sector capital investment.
   In addition, investment profits will surge in Japan, with the
outstanding balance of investments in 2000 reaching $1.100 trillion
and profits totaling at least $80 billion a year, the institute
said.
   A characteristic of the Japanese economy toward the year 2000
will be clearly reflected in the country's international balance of
payments, according to the think tank.
   Japan's trade surplus will shrink to $600 million from $94.3
billion in fiscal 1987 ended last March, almost attaining
equilibrium, it said. Exports will increase an average 7.2 percent
in each of the years but imports will register an 11.6 percent rise
due in part to stronger internal demand for manufactured goods, the
institute said.
   However, Japan won't become a net debtor, according to the
institute.
   The institute said the U.S. economy has the potential to attain
growth exceeding 3 percent a year after inflation is taken into
account.
   ``Already, its trade deficit has been shrinking as a result of
economic expansion led by exports,'' it said.
   The U.S. budget deficit also will dwindle because of high tax
revenues, it predicted. By the mid-1990s the so-called ``twin
deficts'' will largely disappear, it said.

<HEAD>Breaking The Credit Barrier</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every year a new crop of youngsters enters the
world of adult finance, the first requirement of which is access to
credit in their own names.
   This is a credit society, and those who don't have it _ who, in
fact, might disdain it in favor of paying everything in cash _ very
often find themselves in perplexing situations.
   In fact, it has been argued from time to time that credit is a
right, since the possibilities of existing or advancing in a credit
society are greatly lessened for those who pay in cash or are
denied access to the system.
   Having credit is, in a sense, a person's identity in the
marketplace, often being necessary to rent a car or reserve a hotel
room. An absolutely credit-free record might be admired in some
places, but not in the marketplace.
   It is odd, therefore, that there is no smooth, formal,
recognized, accepted, institutionalized way of entering the world
of credit. You must, so to speak, walk through the wall. There is
no door; there isn't even a key.
   At most, there are a few tips, says the Consumer Credit
Institute, to wit:
   _If you haven't already done so, open a checking account and a
savings account at a financial institution. You may then use the
institution as a credit reference, assuming you keep your checkbook
correctly posted.
   _After a couple of months, ask that institution for a Visa or
Mastercard line of credit. Some might offer these cards even before
you apply. If so, take them, and never miss a payment.
   _Investigate ``affinity group'' credit. This is credit made
available to members of a particular group, including alumni of
colleges. Such groups sometimes offer widely accept credit cards.
   _Check on the prospect of using your savings account as
collateral for a loan. Generally, such loans also carry very low
interest rates.
   _Apply for a local retailer's charge card. Small stores tend to
judge you at face value rather than through credit history. They
want your business. If you obtain credit, pay your bills promptly.
You want them as a reference.
   Even if you're successful in all these possibilities, you still
might be forced into having a co-signer for big-ticket items such
as an automobiles. Co-signers often are parents.
   Most of these suggestions are from the institute, a division of
the American Financial Services Association, which represents
companies that lend to consumers and small businesses. But such
suggestion are only the beginning.
   That is, once credit is established, it must be built, a process
that new credit-users have always sought to speed up. It can be
done, although it might cost a small amount of money.
   The technique, used over the years by many entrepreneurs, is to
borrow money and then simply use it and a bit more to repay the
loan ahead of the scheduled repayment date. Pre-payment impresses
lenders.
   On the next visit to the lender you make use of your good
record. You apply for a somewhat larger amount, and because of your
good repayment record you might get it.
   Tyler Hicks, a business executive and author of more than 50
books on grassroots financing, describes a once popular technique
in which borrowers obtained three times as much money as their
financial situation would suggest.
   The technique was simple: Knowing they faced a turndown if they
applied for $15,000, they applied instead for five $5,000 loans at
five banks in the same day.
   To the question, ``Do you owe money to any other lender?'' they
would answer ``no.'' It was an honest answer, since they really had
no big debts outstanding.
   If the person was lucky, and appeared to be reliable and
responsible, perhaps three banks would respond with $5,000 each.
The trick then was to find an investment that would make the
$15,000 grow larger.
   The more conservative of these borrowers would refrain from
using the entire $15,000, but instead would invest $10,000 in an
income-producing property and keep $5,000 in reserve to service the
three loans.
   It was a desperate procedure, but many real estate investors got
started with this or similar techniques.
   They agree it was dangerous to their financial health, but as
they saw it, it was even unhealthier to attempt getting along
without sufficient credit in a credit-based society.

<HEAD>Tokyo And Osaka Exchanges To Launch Index Futures Trading</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As part of a wave of liberalization in Japan's
financial markets, the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges are to
launch stock index futures trading starting Saturday.
   Exchange officials say the index futures market is likely to
exceed the size of the regular stock market within a few years and
affect the investment patterns of Japanese institutional investors.
   They also say it is an ideal opportunity for foreign investment
firms, which are more experienced in futures trading than their
Japanese counterparts, to penetrate Japanese financial markets.
   ``We are hoping the new index futures trading will also promote
the growth of the equity market as the futures market attracts more
money to stock markets,'' said Keiichi Okada, head of the Tokyo
Stock Exchange's futures trading department. ``I expect the index
futures market will exceed the size of the cash market within a few
years.''
   Index futures contracts allow speculative investors to bet on
the direction of an entire set of stocks rather than putting their
money into stocks of individual companies. More cautious investors
can use index futures contracts as hedges to offset positions in
the stock market.
   Index futures contracts would also permit various forms of
program trading, including index arbitrage, which some critics
blame for exacerbating the instability of prices on Wall Street.
   Both exchanges said they will allow foreign non-member
securities firms to participate in index futures trading.
   ``Foreign securities companies are more experienced in futures
trading than their Japanese counterparts,'' said Okada. ``They will
have an edge over their Japanese competitors. At the same time,
Japanese securities companies can learn from them.''
   The inauguration of index futures trading in Japan has been long
awaited by investors eager to hedge against possible fluctuations
of share prices in the equity markets. While major stock exchanges
around the world offer a broad range of financial futures trading,
Japan has offered only 10-year government bond futures. Trading in
them began in 1985.
   As pressure mounts to make the Japanese money market more open
and internationalized, Japanese exchanges and the securities
industry have been gradually launching new services to keep up with
rapidly changing and diversifying demands.
   The Tokyo exchange will use the Tokyo Stock Exchange price
index, or Topix, an index of all 1,100 shares on the exchange's
first section weighted toward the bigger companies, while the
Osaka's futures market will be based on the more popular Nikkei
Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a simple average of 225
leading stocks.
   Analysts and exchange officials say TOPIX is a more accurate
indicator of overall market trends, but the Nikkei index is more
responsive to the mood of the market.
   ``TOPIX is not as vulnerable to the fluctuation of high priced,
small-capital shares like the Nikkei index is, but Nikkei is by far
the best-known index,'' said Okada.
   Institutional investors generally welcome the new system, which
can protect them from day-to-day price fluctuations in their
stocks. But some are concerned that the index futures market may
have a negative impact on the equity market.
   ``When the futures market is on a downturn, most investors will
assume the spot market also will be heading downward shortly and
withdraw their funds from the spot market,'' said a securities
dealer at a major brokerage in Tokyo, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``It will cause a further decline in share prices.''

<HEAD>EPA Sues Chevron, Charging Benzene Leaks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal Environmental Protection Agency
is suing Chevron U.S.A. Inc., charging cancer-causing benzene is
leaking from its refinery in south Philadelphia, the company
announced Tuesday.
   The EPA filed suit in U.S. District Court here Monday accusing
the gasoline giant of consistently failing over the past four years
to monitor and repair the equipment that handles benzene at the
refinery.
   Jack Galloway, spokesman for Chevron's East Coast operations,
said the company was in compliance with EPA regulations. Galloway
said the company would cooperate with the EPA on any problems that
might have occurred.
   The suit seeks an injunction requiring the San Francisco-based
corporation to comply with the federal Clean Air Act.
   ``Unless enjoined by an order of this court,'' the lawsuit says,
``these violations will continue.''
   For each of the 19 alleged violations of the federal law, the
suit seeks penalties of up to $25,000 a day. Neither the lawsuit
nor government spokesmen gave a total dollar amount of possible
fines.
   ``Benzene constitutes a serious health threat when released into
the air. ... It is EPA policy to take whatever steps are necessary
to ensure compliance with applicable emission standards,'' James M.
Seif, regional EPA administrator, said in a press release
announcing the suit.
   Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert J. Smolski said it was
unclear how much benzene had escaped from the refinery system
because of the alleged violations. Different leaks have been
occurring since 1984, he said.
   Galloway said that of 338 workers checked for benzene exposure
in 1987, 98.3 percent were under EPA limits. He noted that the
refinery is about 1{ miles from any homes.

   Stocks went nowhere today in what Wall Street
brokers described as listless dog-day trading.
   ``There's really nothing going on. The floor is very quiet,''
said Charles Eaton, a market strategist at Nikko Securities Co.
International in New York.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which rose 24
points Monday in some of the lightest trading this year, was up
0.53 point by 2 p.m. EDT to 2,041.96.
   Among broader market barometers, the New York Stock Exchange
composite index of all listed issues was up 0.14 to 148.69. The
American Stock Exchange's market value index was down 0.46 to
294.59.
   Declining and advancing issues were about even on the NYSE, with
665 up, 653 down and 550 unchanged. Volume on the Big Board totaled
only 74.47 million shares with two hours of business left.
   Brokers said Commerce Department reports released today that
suggested the economy is slowing down, thereby easing fears of
inflation, failed to induce much interest on Wall Street.
   The department said its chief forecasting gauge of future
economic activity dropped 0.8 percent in July, the sharpest decline
in eight months, and U.S. factory orders fell 3.5 percent. The
figures were within expectations.
   Some brokers attributed the lack of business to pre-Labor Day
vacationing. Others said professional investors were awaiting a
more telling report on the economy's direction, the August
unemployment data released Friday by the Labor Department.
   Among the blue chip stocks, McDonalds was off \ to 43], IBM was
off ] to 113 and Procter & Gamble was up \ to 74~.
   One of the Big Board's most active issue was Middle South
Utilities, up \ to 13{ on volume exceeding 1.7 million shares.
There was speculation the power company was preparing to resume
paying a dividend.
   Primerica, which agreed Monday to be acquired by Commercial
Credit Co. in a cash and securities deal valued at about $1.65
billion, slipped | to 28~.
   On the over-the-counter market, Lotus Development fell 1 to 18.

   The government said today its chief
forecasting gauge of future economic activity dropped 0.8 percent
in July, the sharpest decline in eight months.
   Economists said the drop in the Commerce Department's Index of
Leading Economic Indicators may be a signal of a pause in what has
been booming economic growth this year. But they cautioned against
reading too much into a single month's figures.
   The July decline was the biggest since last November, when the
index dropped 1.0 percent in the wake of the October stock market
crash.
   The latest drop was likely to be seen as good news by the stock
and bond markets, which have faltered in recent weeks on fears that
inflation is heating up.
   But the dip follows a 1.4 percent jump in the index in June, the
biggest increase in 18 months. The Commerce Department revised its
estimate for May, calculating now that the indicators were off by
0.7 percent instead of the previously reported 0.8 percent.
   White House spokesman B. Jay Cooper said, ``The data suggest
continued economic growth in the months ahead, although at a more
moderate pace than in the first half'' of the year. Cooper was in
Santa Barbara, Calif., with the vacationing President Reagan.
   The government said last week that the U.S. economy, as measured
by the gross national product, grew at an annual rate of 3.3
percent in the April-June quarter, following a 3.4 percent
expansion pace in the first three months of the year.
   This strong growth has raised concern at the Federal Reserve
Board, which is charged with keeping inflation under control.
   The Fed has been pusing up short-term interest rates since late
March in an attempt to slow growth to a sustainable,
non-inflationary pace. On Aug. 9, it took its most dramatic
inflation-fighting move by raising the discount rate, its key bank
lending rate, by a half percentage point.
   Since then, analysts have been watching government economic
statistics closely for indications of whether the Fed has tigtened
enough.
   In July, the weakness in the leading indicators was widespread,
with seven of the available nine components registering declines.
   The biggest drain came from an 11.3 percent jump in unemployment
claims. That was followed in order of severity by a drop in new
orders for consumer goods; a decline in building permits; a speedup
in business deliveries, considered a sign of slackening demand; a
drop in the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, a contraction of
the money supply and a drop in plant and equipment orders.
   One indicator, a rise in prices for raw materials, was read as a
sign of economic strength. The length of the average workweek was
unchanged in July.
   The 0.8 percent overall decline left the index at 192.1 percent
of its 1967 base of 100.

   Michael Evans, a private economic forecaster in Washington, said
he expected GNP growth likely will slow to an annual rate of 2.5
percent in the second half, closer to what the Federal Reserve
considers sustainable without quickening inflaton.
   He said growth in U.S. exports and increases in investment
spending by businesses likely would slow from the torrid pace
earlier this year. Also, higher interest rates are already
beginning to pinch the housing industry.
   However, David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Co.,
a government securities dealer in New York, said the momentum of
the economy will keep growth strong until at least the second half
of next year.
   ``I really think we'll see just a temporary slowing. My own
feeling is economic growth in the second half will continue at
about the same pace as the first half,'' he said.
   ``My own guess is that there will have to be some more Fed
tightening and still higher interest rates. But most of that upward
pressure will come after the election and we'll see a pause for a
while,'' he said.
   Economists cautioned against drawing firm conclusions from the
leading index until a clear pattern emerges over three months.
   Since it was created in 1948, the index has fallen three months
in a row a total of 12 times. In eight of those instances, a
recession followed. The other four times, economic growth slowed,
but there was no recession.
   The index last declined three consecutive months from June
through August in 1984. There was no recession, but the economy did
enter a two-year period of slow growth.
   Also, initial estimates of the index are frequently revised
substantially in later months.
   For instance, within the last year, there were preliminary
reports of declines for five consecutive months _ from September
through January. However, later revisions wiped out all but two of
those drops, in November and January.

   The government said Tuesday its chief
forecasting gauge of future economic activity suffered the steepest
drop in eight months in July, but few analysts expect a substantial
slackening in growth anytime soon.
   The 0.8 percent decline in the Commerce Department's Index of
Leading Economic Indicators was the biggest since last November,
when the index dropped 1.0 percent in the aftermath of the October
stock market crash.
   However, economists noted that the index posted an exceptionally
strong increase in June and cautioned against reading too much into
a one-month downturn.
   In a separate report, the Commerce Department said orders to
U.S. factories for manufactured goods plunged 3.5 percent in July,
the worst decline in 18 months. But that drop followed a very
strong showing in June and was heavily influenced by a wide swing
in orders for military equipment.
   ``Despite the declines, we're not going to have any slowing in
the imminent future,'' said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with
Merrill Lynch in New York.
   The economy, as measured by the gross national product, grew at
a 3.3 percent annual rate in the three months ended in June and at
a 3.4 percent pace in the first quarter.
   Steinberg said this strong growth, which surprised many
economists who had been anticipating a recession after the stock
market crash, likely would continue through the July-September
quarter.
   White House spokesman B. Jay Cooper, in California with the
vacationing President Reagan, said, ``The data suggest continued
economic growth in the months ahead, although at a more moderate
pace than in the first half'' of the year.
   Barring something unforeseen, the economy could turn in its
strongest performance since 1984. That would be good news for Vice
President George Bush, who is counting on a feeling of economic
optimism among voters to bolster his chances of beatwk
Quayle measures up.
   In eight years in the Senate, Quayle has been known mostly f agan's
Strategic Defense Initiative, his
battle for the controversial federal court appointment of Daniel
Manion and a losing fight against the 60-day notification for plant
closings.
   ``I don't remember anything in particular,'' Bentsen said, when
asked if he had squared off against Quayle on any other issues.
   And he makes repeated subtle references to Quayle's youth.
   ``I certainly don't think he's too young but certainly you've
got to have some maturity'' to be a heartbeat away from the
presidency, he said at one Kentucky stop. When reporters goaded
Bentsen with questions on whether Quayle would still be on the
ticket Nov. 8, the Texan finally couldn't resist.
   ``I hope so,'' he said.
   But away from the public eye, Bentsen and his top aides are
concerned about going into debate against Quayle.
   Bentsen is younger than President Reagan was when he won the
White House, but his face looks older, especially on television.
The campaign has signed him up for coaching anD O/Llo he won't appear wooden

   And holding his own might be good enough to be declared the
winner, given the low expectations accorded the Indiana senator.
   ``We're on the wrong end of the expectations game, as far as the
vice presidential debate is concerned, because everyone expects
Sen. Bentsen to do so well,'' said Linda Peek, a long-time Senate
Democratic strategist who is now a private consultant in Washington.
   Other Democrats already are defending Bentsen, in advance of a
debate that may never come off.
   ``The senator is concerned about a debate because his style as a
senator is to get things done and he doesn't engage in a lot of
sparring on the floor,'' national party spokesman Mike McCurry
said. On the other hand, ``It's easy to envision Dan Quayle as a TV
talk show host.''
   Bentsen also must be careful not to bludgeon Quayle and win him
a backlash of sympathy among voters, as has occurred in the recent
controversy over Quayle's National Guard record.
   Norman Ornstein, who studies politics at the American Enterprise
Institute, says the Democrats have reason to worry about Quayle.
   ``He is not a dummy,'' Ornstein said. In past debates, such as
when he defeated incumbent Birch Bayh to win the Senate in 1980,
Quayle showed ``when he was prepared, well-briefed, and focused, he
could do all right.''
   Bentsen, meanwhile, has the difficult task of not wanting to
help the Republicans in their expectations game and also not
wanting to speak well of Quayle.
   ``It isn't in Bentsen's interest to talk about Quayle,''
Ornstein said.
   So while he clearly sees Quayle as a lesser opponent, Bentsen
must focus his attacks away from the man and back to the issues and
Quayle's conservative voting record.
   ``I don't want to get into his personal life. That I don't want
to do,'' Bentsen says.
   Then Bentsen hints about which Republican would have been a
worthy opponent.
   ``I thought it would be Bob Dole, frankly,'' he says. ``It's a
real gamble picking Quayle, and I think it's going to be proven
that way.''

<HEAD>OPEC Chief Says Gulf Peace Will Strengthen Oil Cartel</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subroto as one name correct</NOTE>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto said
Tuesday that ending the Iran-Iraq war will strengthen the oil
cartel, but he gave no clue whether Iran has agreed to let its foe
have an oil production quota equal to its own.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, said Subroto, Indonesia's former Energy Minister, made the
comments after a meeting with President Ali Khamenei in Tehran.
   Subroto arrived Monday from Kuwait seeking to persuade Iran to
agree to allow Iraq an OPEC quota of at least 2.39 million barrels
a day.
   Iraq has refused to accept a quota of 1.5 million barrels a day,
about half its current output, and insists on parity with Iran.
   The deadlock, with Iraq pumping an estimated 2.5 million barrels
a day to boost its revenue and repair its war-damaged economy, has
worsened the problem of over-production by some OPEC member states.
   The Middle East Economic Survey, a respected oil industry weekly
published in Nicosia, said Monday the output by the 13-member
cartel this month was around 20 million barrels a day.
   That's about 3.5 million barrels a day over OPEC's overall
production quota and was seen as a key factor in depressing world
oil prices.
   IRNA quoted Khamenei as saying OPEC members should strictly
adhere to their quotas. But he too made no direct mention of the
issue of Iraq's quota.
   But he did note that among Iran's prime concerns were OPEC unity
and resolving the organization's problems.
   Subroto was expected to fly to Baghdad, Iraq's capital, through
Kuwait Wednesday.
   He had talks Monday with Iran's Oil Minister, Gholamreza
Aqazadeh. IRNA said Subroto briefed Aqazadeh on his earlier visits
to Venezuela, Ecuador, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Kuwait on the
over-production issue. But it gave no details.
   OPEC overcame a major stumbling block to its efforts to impose
production discipline earlier this month after Venezuela dropped
its veto against giving Iraq a quota equal to Iran's.
   Eleven of the OPEC states now agree to that. Iran is now the
only holdout.
   With the United Nations-sponsored Aug.20 cease-fire apparently
holding, Iraq and Iran have both started repairing oil facilities
damaged in the nearly eight years of fighting.
   Oil industry sources believe that Iraq will be able to install
makeshift oil loading terminals in the northern gulf within a few
months, allowing it to boost its export capacity by 1 million
barrels a day.
   Iraq is also expanding its export pipeline network, which would
increase its production capacity to more than 3 million barrels a
day by the end of the decade.
   The Iranians are repairing the heavily bombed Kharg island
terminal, which accounts for 90 percent of their oil exports.
   Iran's deputy oil minister, Khazempour Ardebili said earlier
this month that Tehran's long-term target is to boost production to
around 4.5 million barrels a day, its pre-war level.
   But the Middle East Economic Survey noted that in the short
term, production will likely only increase to around 2.8 million
barrels a day.

   Stocks went nowhere today in what Wall Street
brokers described as listless dog-day trading.
   ``There's really nothing going on. The floor is very quiet,''
said Charles Eaton, a market strategist at Nikko Securities Co.
International in New York.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which rose 24
points Monday in some of the lightest trading this year, was down
2.31 to 2,039.12 by 3 p.m. EDT.
   Among broader market barometers, the New York Stock Exchange
composite index of all listed issues was up 0.14 to 148.69. The
American Stock Exchange's market value index was down 0.41 to
294.64.
   Advancing issues held a slight edge over declines on the NYSE,
with 679 up, 645 down and 589 unchanged. Volume on the Big Board
totaled only 89.11 million shares with an hour of business left.
   Brokers said Commerce Department reports released today that
suggested the economy is slowing down, thereby easing fears of
inflation, failed to induce much interest on Wall Street.
   The department said its chief forecasting gauge of future
economic activity dropped 0.8 percent in July, the sharpest decline
in eight months, and U.S. factory orders fell 3.5 percent. The
figures were within expectations.
   Some brokers attributed the slack business to pre-Labor Day
vacationing. Others said professional investors were awaiting a
more telling report on the economy's direction, the August
unemployment data released Friday by the Labor Department.

   Grain and soybean futures closed sharply higher
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade with the wheat market leading
the way on news that China and India each were seeking to buy
300,000 metric tons of subsidized U.S. wheat.
   Rumors that the Soviet Union was arranging to have grain shipped
from the United States fueled speculation that the Soviets also
were in the market for U.S. wheat, but that could not be confirmed,
analysts said.
   ``Supposedly they were chartering freight, but we don't know if
that's for business that's already been done or business that's
going to be done,'' said Cathy Leow, an assistant vice president in
the grain futures trading division of Thomson McKinnon Securities
Inc. in New York.
   Corn futures prices got an additional boost from news that a
federal magistrate in St. Paul, Minn., recommended the Agriculture
Department be ordered to extend indefinitely crop price-support
loans scheduled to mature on Wednesday.
   The recommendation, if accepted by the judge hearing a case
brought by several farmers, would delay the release of 400 million
to 500 million bushels of corn onto the market.
   Soybeans posted sharp gains late in the session, mostly on
spillover buying from the grain pits, Ms. Leow said.
   At the close, wheat was 8\ cents to 11 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.95{ a bushel; corn was {
cent to 5} cents higher with Setember at $2.78} a bushel; oats were
5 cents to 8{ cents higher with September at $2.54{ a bushel;
soybeans were 14{ cents to 23 cents higher with September at $8.48
a bushel.

   A federal judge said today that Eastern
Airlines may curtail service but must return to the bargaining
table and negotiate over the proposed layoffs of 4,000 employees.
   Eastern said it would file an emergency appeal, although it
expressed satisfaction that the ruling would allow it to carry
through with plans to drop some routes.
   U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker said Eastern had shown
through testimony that it has the right to change schedules, reduce
flights and close its hub at Kansas City as the airline has
proposed ``without first bargaining with the plaintiffs.''
   The plaintiffs are three unions fighting Eastern's plans to fire
4,000 workers. Eastern announced July 22 that it would close its
Kansas City hub and eliminate 140 of its 1,225 flights daily.
   ``Testimony also supports the conclusion that the proposed
operational changes are motivated by sound financial reasons,'' the
judge wrote in a 50-page opinion. ``Even plaintiffs' experts agreed
that Eastern has legitimate and compelling business reasons to
withdraw from the Kansas City hub.''
   The judge wrote, however, that just because the cutbacks are
necessary economically does not mean Eastern can bypass bargaining
with its unions.
   ``Massive layoffs are not, and shall never be, business as
usual,'' he wrote. ``The Railway Labor Act requires Eastern to
bargain with its unions before taking unilateral action to
eliminate 12 percent of its worforce.''
   Included among those employees are 1,000 flight attendants,
1,000 machinists and 500 pilots.
   Eastern President Phil Bakes, in a prepared statement from Miami
corporate headquarters, said Eastern was pleased its fall schedule
has been left intact but would file an emergency appeal and request
for stay because the order ``is gravely wrong.''
   ``Eastern, like any American business, must be allowed to prune
money-losing operations,'' he said. ``We must be able to take
prudent, although sometimes painful, measures in the best interests
of the company and our employees.''
   Bakes called Parker's ruling ``a fundamental misreading'' of the
Railway Labor Act that could ``profoundly disrupt the entire
airline industry and undermine the very essence of deregulation.''
   Union leaders in Miami said they wanted to study the ruling
before commenting.
   Eastern's lawyers had no comment after a brief hearing in
Parker's court involving the bond that Eastern is seeking from the
three union plaintiffs. Such a bond protects a defendant for losses
suffered if he should win on appeal.
   Parker had issued a temporary restraining order against the
furloughs on Aug. 4 and extended it last Friday.
   Parker cited a Supreme Court ruling that many business decisions
are subject to bargaining, including management actions taken to
eliminate wasteful practices.
   The labor agreements Eastern made with its unions ``provide no
justification for a wholesale restructuring of the air line
workforce,'' he wrote. ``Employers subject to the RLA (Railway
Labor Act) must bargain with their unions even over fundamental
decisions affecting the very scope and direction of their
employer's enterprise.''

   The stock market wallowed in more sluggish
trading today but still managed to finish slightly higher, which
some investment professionals considered an encouraging sign.
   They said the market's behavior today defied fears of
profit-taking in the aftermath of the sharp runup of the previous
session and suggested that big institutional investors are taking
more interest in acquiring stocks.
   ``I was worried that if the institutions came in and sold
stocks, we would have seen a tremendous vacuum on the downside,''
said Philip C. Puccio, senior vice president and manager of
institutional trading at Dillon Read & Co. in New York. ``The

<HEAD>Flight Attendants Ask DOT to Investigate Icahn's Fitness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARJORIE ANDERS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carl Icahn is using TWA as his personal cash cow
to the detriment of the airline and public safety, the flight
attendants union charged Tuesday.
   The union asked the U.S. Department of Transportation to block
Icahn's plan to take Trans World Airlines Inc. private and to
freeze TWA assets while it investigates his fitness to continue
managing the airline.
   Vicki Frankovich, president of the Independent Federation of
Flight Attendants, charged that since Icahn took control of TWA a
little more than two years ago, he has ``milked'' the airline's
cash reserves and sold off assets to finance his stock market and
takeover ventures rather than buy new airplanes and other safety
equipment needed to assure TWA's future.
   Through spokesman Bob Allen, Icahn called IFFA's allegations
``spurious, malicious and erroneous'' and designed ``to embarrass
the airline.''
   ``Today TWA has more planes, serves more airports and carries
more passengers than in 1986,'' Allen said in a formal statement.
   Still, TWA's fleet remains the oldest in the industry; the
average plane is 14.6 years old, the union said. A TWA Boeing 727
that landed on its belly Saturday in Chicago when its landing gear
failed to descend was 24 years old, according to the National
Transportation Safety Board, which still is investigating the cause
of that incident.
   The union criticized TWA's plans to spend just 1 percent of the
gross value of its fleet on new equipment this year while other
airlines are spending about 15 or 20 percent on new, fuel-efficient
planes.
   This, the union says, contributes to high maintenance costs and
the airline's accident and incident rate, which according to the
Federal Aviation Administration is the worst among the top 10
American airlines.
   Old airplanes also cost more to maintain than new ones and TWA
will have to spend more and more to keep its planes safe, the union
says.
   ``This would require a healthy cash flow,'' Frankovich said.
``But according to disclosures in Icahn's own filings before the
Securities and Exchange Commission, TWA's cash flow is not expected
to be sufficient to repay the increased debt to be incurred under
his privatization plan.''
   Icahn, who owns 75 percent of TWA's stock, will ask minority
shareholders at a meeting Sept. 7 to sell their stock to him.
Payments would be financed by the sale of $250 million in
speculative, high-yield bonds.
   This would raise TWA's annual interest payments to $466 million,
almost double the airline's 1987 operating earnings of $240
million, according to IFFA's analysis.
   In addition, for his TWA stock, Icahn would receive $400 million
in TWA assets, including a big chunk of Texaco stock, the union
said.
   ``TWA is being managed today not as an air carrier but as an
unsupervised mutual fund benefiting Mr. Icahn,'' Frankovich said.
   ``Unless the DOT acts now to stop him, Carl Icahn and his
companies will take $650 million out of an already weakened TWA and
leave the flying public, his creditors and his long-suffering
employees to reap the sad and perhaps tragic consequences,'' she
added.
   Icahn, in his statement, said: ``I have no doubt that TWA
employees, the traveling public and the appropriate government
officials will see through IFFA's meritless charges and understand
IFFA's motivation.''
   TWA's machinists union, which also opposes the privatization and
filed suit in federal court last week to stop it, is being asked to
join the IFFA petition but has not yet had time to study it,
Frankovich said.
   Unions at Eastern Airlines made a similar request to the DOT
last year. In its findings the DOT said acrimonious relations
between labor and management could lead to operational problems and
a former U.S. Secretary of Labor was appointed to act as a mediator.

   Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured
goods fell sharply in July, pulled down by the biggest drop in
defense orders in more than four years, the government said Tuesday.
   The Commerce Department said orders for both durable and
non-durable goods slipped 3.5 percent to $220.2 billion last month.
It was the worst drop since January 1987, when orders fell 3.6
percent.
   But economists were not concerned about the decrease because it
was heavily influenced by the volatile military goods category and
came one month after the strongest increase in total orders in more
than 17 years.
   ``The orders numbers were down because of some fluctuations in
some very volatile categories. They'll be up again in August,''
said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch in New York.
   In July, defense orders plummeted 46.6 percent to $7.4 billion,
reversing a 68.3 percent gain a month earlier. Last month's drop in
this category was the steepest since April 1984. The June increase
had been the biggest since December 1982.
   Excluding the defense category, orders were down 0.7 percent in
July following a healthy 2.9 percent gain in June.
   U.S. manufacturing, which languished earlier in the decade
because of the strong dollar, has rebounded. The weaker dollar has
fueled a resurgence in sales of American goods overseas and
businesses have responded by spending more to upgrade and replace
outmoded plant and equipment.
   But demand for U.S. goods has been so strong that some analysts
are concerned that factory capacity will be strained, pushing
prices higher.
   Samuel D. Kahan, an economist with Kleinwort Benson Government
Securities Inc. in Chicago, said that despite the overall drop in
factory orders in July, ``there is very little evidence yet that
the manufacturing sector is moderating.''
   A particular sign of strength, he said, is the category of
non-defense capital goods, which is considered a good indication of
business expansion plans. It was up 0.9 percent to $35.8 billion,
following a 12.5 percent increase in June.
   ``That, I think, is the more telling story. .... Despite the
fact that last month's number was a strong increase, we were still
able to scratch out a further increase this month,'' Kahan said.
   The overall July decline followed a 5.4 percent surge in June,
the biggest since December 1970. Orders were down 0.3 percent in
May.
   The Commerce Department offered these details of July activity:
   _Total orders for durable goods, ``big ticket'' items expected
to last three or more years, were off 7.1 percent in July following
an 8.7 percent gain in June.
   _Orders for transportation equipment, both military and
non-military, were off 22.0 percent after soaring 33.3 percent a
month earlier.
   _Non-electrical machinery was down 4.2 percent, while electrical
machinery jumped 4.1 percent.
   _Orders for non-durable goods rose 1.0 percent after increasing
1.6 percent a month earlier.
   _Shipments of manufactured goods fell 0.9 percent to $216.9
billion, after rising 1.4 percent in June.

   A federal judge Tuesday sentenced two former bank
officers to prison for contributing to the near-collapse of
Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. in the early 1980s.
   U.S. District Judge Milton Shadur sentenced John R. Lytle, 53, a
former Continental vice president, to 3{ years in prison.
   William G. Patterson, former head of energy lending at Penn
Square Bank of Oklahoma City, was sentenced to a 2-year term.
   Lytle, 53, and Patterson, 38, had pleaded guilty June 30 to
criminal charges in an alleged scheme that involved risky loans and
kickbacks.
   Penn Square failed in 1982, and Continental came close to
collapse two years later after the largest run on desposits in
banking history.
   They were scheduled to report to prison authorities on Oct. 11.
   Testifying before his sentencing Tuesday, Lytle said he accepted
responsibility for his actions. He asked the judge to sentence him
to no more than six months in jail and then put him on probation
and allow him to work with the poor on Chicago's West Side.
   ``I wish desperately that I could reverse the events of the
1980s,'' Lytle told Shadur. ``In various ways and in increasing
amounts, I have a desire to redeem myself.
   ``Working with poor children is an area where I'm experienced,
where I have great love and where I have a track record. Please,
your honor, give me an opportunity to give service,'' Lytle pleaded.
   Patterson, who held his head and cried as he spoke, said he was
sorry for his actions and was concerned about his family.
   ``I'm sorry for the people in Chicago and Oklahoma,'' he said.
``I think of that a lot.''
   But prosecutor Joe Duffy said the two men must be punished
because they had abused a special trust.
   ``Society's rights and needs must take precedence over the
defendants and their family,'' Duffy told the judge. ``Anything
less would send a confusing message to the American people.''
   Lytle pleaded guilty to misapplication of bank funds and
Patterson pleaded guilty to charges that he aided and abetted
Lytle. The pleas came two months after the trial of the two men
ended with a deadlocked jury.
   Prosecutors charged that Patterson had manipulated Lytle and a
third man, Oklahoma drilling contractor Jere Sturgis, in schemes to
save his own failing bank. Sturgis was acquitted of wire fraud
charges.
   The government accused Lytle, caught in spiraling personal debt
to finance a luxurious lifestyle, of accepting kickbacks from
Patterson in exchange for buying risky energy loans from Penn
Square for Continental.
   Defense attorneys contended Continental, which was kept afloat
by a $4.5 billion government bailout, was saddled with the
troublesome energy loans because of an aggressive lending policy.

<HEAD>Pork Futures Plunge Again On Signs Of Seasonal Slaughter Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Pork futures prices plunged for the second straight day Tuesday
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange amid signs of an expected
seasonal upturn in hog slaughters.
   On other markets, grain and soybean futures rose sharply;
precious metals drifted lower; energy futures advanced; and
stock-index futures retreated.
   A recent pickup in hog slaughters suggests last spring's
unusually large pig crop is beginning to come to market at least
two weeks later than expected, analysts said.
   Supplies of fattened hogs typically rise in August but this
year's crop _ the largest in five years _ was held back by
producers fearful of transporting the sensitive animals in the
recent record-breaking heat wave.
   ``You usually see the slaughter reach its lowest point in July,
then it increases into November,'' said Thomas Morgan, president of
Sterling Research Corp. of Arlington Heights, Ill.
   Frozen pork-belly futures finished down nearly the
2-cents-a-pound limit Tuesday following limit losses on Monday,
while hogs for December and February delivery lost more than a
penny a pound.
   Because of the large spring pig crop, slaughters during the
fall-winter period are expected to run 7 percent above last year's
level, and hefty supplies of frozen pork will put additional
pressure on prices, said Chuck Levitt, livestock market analyst
with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago.
   ``The market is jittery because we're going into the fall season
with an 87 percent increase in frozen pork stocks from last year,''
he said.
   Expectations of the seasonal slaughter increase were offset last
week by a strong cattle futures market, which kept prices in the
adjacent pork pits from falling sharply, Levitt said.
   But meatpackers now have all the cattle they need to meet the
Labor Day weekend demand, so cattle prices weakened Tuesday.
   Live cattle settled .08 cent to .88 cent lower with the contract
for delivery in October at 72.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were
.40 cent to .83 cent lower with September at 81.82 cents a pound;
hogs were .20 cent to 1.08 cents lower with October at 39.15 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.33 cents to 1.97 cents lower
with February at 50.87 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures finished sharply higher on the Chicago
Board of Trade with the wheat market leading the way on news that
China and India each were seeking to buy 300,000 metric tons of
subsidized U.S. wheat.
   After the close, the Agriculture Department announced it had
accepted bids to cover the sale of 200,000 metric tons of wheat to
India.
   Corn futures prices got an additional boost from news that a
federal magistrate in St. Paul, Minn., had recommended the
Agriculture Department be ordered to extend indefinitely crop
price-support loans scheduled to mature on Wednesday.
   The recommendation, if accepted by the judge hearing a case
brought by several farmers, would delay the release of 400 million
to 500 million bushels of corn onto the market.
   Wheat settled 7} cents to 11 cents higher with the contract for
delivery in September at $3.95{ a bushel; corn was { cent to 5}
cents higher with Setember at $2.79 a bushel; oats were 5 cents to
8\ cents higher with September at $2.54{ a bushel; soybeans were
14{ cents to 23 cents higher with September at $8.47 a bushel.
   Precious metals futures drifted lower in quiet trading on New
York's Commodity Exchange.
   The inflation-sensitive metals were reacting to ideas that the
economy is beginning to slow down, said Peter Cardillo, commodity
futures trading adviser for Josephthal & Co. in New York.
   That view was bolstered by Tuesday's report of a 0.8 percent
drop in the Commerce Department's Index of Leading Economic
Indicators, the sharpest decline in eight months.
   Gold settled $1 to $1.60 lower with October at $431.90 a troy
ounce; silver was 3 cents to 3.9 cents lower with September at
$6.49 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures prices advanced on the New York Mercantile
Exchange in advance of the American Petroleum Institute's weekly
storage report, which analysts said was bullish for the market.
   The API reported U.S. crude oil stocks dipped by 4.2 million
barrels last week while distillate stocks fell by about 3 million
barrels. Gasoline stocks rose by 699,000 barrels.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents to 13 cents
higher with October at $15.27 a barrel; heating oil was .38 cent to
.53 cent higher with September at 43.14 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .15 cent to .79 cent higher with September at 48.03
cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures retreated slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for September delivery of the Standard
& Poor's 500 index settled .30 point lower at 262.70.

   The stock market wallowed through another slow
session Tuesday but still managed a marginally higher finish, which
some strategists interpreted as a positive signal in what has been
a dreary dog-day August.
   ``I was worried that if the institutions came in and sold
stocks, we would have seen a tremendous vacuum on the downside,''
said Philip C. Puccio, senior vice president and head of
institutional trading at Dillon Read & Co. in New York. ``The
buyers stepped up to the plate and took out a lot of sell
interest.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which rose 24
points Monday, overcame an early decline, stabilized but eroded
near the close, finishing down 3.20 to 2,038.23. Broader market
measurements were mostly higher.
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was the fourth-lowest this
year at 108.72 million shares, compared with the Monday level of
99.23 million shares, the second-lowest, and the Friday volume of
89.24 million shares, the lowest.
   Traders offered a variety of reasons for the lethargic business,
ranging pre-Labor Day vacationing to investor apathy that has
pervaded the market all month.
   ``The volume is so thin, I think the trigger pullers are all out
at the Hamptons,'' said Charles Eaton, a market strategest at Nikko
Securities Co. International in New York.
   Hildegarde Zagorski, a stock analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York, suggested many investors were awaiting
the Labor Department's report Friday on August unemployment, which
could provide clear signals on the direction of the economy and
interest rates, two key market concerns.
   ``Nobody's too willing to get into the market ahead of those
numbers,'' she said. Commerce Department reports Tuesday on the
index of leading indicators and factory orders for July, she said,
had little impact on Wall Street because the numbers were well
within expectations.
   Puccio said that unlike the previous session, at least half the
participation in the market Tuesday was from the big institutional
investors that have the potential to incite a broad rally with
healthier volumes.
   He said if the unemployment figures suggest the economy is
slowing down, thereby easing the risk of inflation, ``a lot more
participants will come into this market.''
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7-to-6 in
nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 741 up, 644 down and
564 unchanged.
   Among the most prominent issues, Gould jumped 7[ to $22.75 in a
late spurt of buying on news that Nippon Mining of Japan would
acquire the company for $23.25 a share. The announcement came
shortly before the close of trading.
   Federal Home Loan Mortgage's preferred stock advanced 5{ to 144{
after it announced further details of a plan to ease ownership
restrictions.
   Blue chips were mixed. IBM fell { to 112~, Union Carbide rose ]
to 22], Goodyear fell { to 60[ and General Electric rose \ to 40{.
   On the over-the-counter market, Lotus Development fell ~ to 18[.
The Wall Street Journal said in a front-page article that the
computer software maker faced increased competition, falling market
share and lower profits.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market,
totaled 129.19 million shares.
   The Wilshire Associates Equity Index, the market value of NYSE,
American and OTC issues, rose $1.91 billion.
   The NYSE index rose 0.11 to 148.66.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 0.12 to 301.32, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index rose 0.18 to 262.51.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 0.14
to 294.91. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 376.49, up 0.28.

<HEAD>Georgia Power, Southern Co. Tax Accounting Investigated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Court papers unsealed Tuesday show federal agents
are trying to determine if Georgia Power Co. avoided paying
millions of dollars in federal taxes through the way it accounted
for spare parts.
   Besides Georgia Power, one of the nation's richest utilities,
the investigation includes its parent, the Southern Co., and the
Big Eight accounting firm of Arthur Andersen & Co.
   The papers raise the question of whether the companies and their
accountants sought to hide about $61 million in spare parts to
avoid paying $50 million in federal taxes, interest and penalties.
The complicated arrangement deals with whether parts are classified
as being emergency spare parts or for maintenance and when they
become expenses to the company.
   The papers also raise the question of Georgia Power's accounting
for the sale of 5 percent of Plant Vogtle nuclear power plant to
the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia. In the documents,
officials say the deal was treated as a sale of 5 percent of the
$8.87 billion plant for book value purposes, but as 1.35 percent
for tax purposes, saving the company between $10 million and $12
million.
   The papers include excerpts of taped conversations in which
Southern Co.'s tax chief agrees with a confidential informant that
the company misled the IRS over the tax accounting of the spare
parts, but adds, ``Don't ever say that.''
   The investigation, which dates from 1982, is based largely on
information contained in taped conversations between utility and
Andersen officials and the informant, who is being paid for his
participation and been exempted from prosecution, according to the
court papers.
   U.S. Attorney Robert Barr confirmed the investigation, but
refused to provide details beyond what was contained in the papers
because a grand jury is involved.
   He said the investigation, which is continuing, involves
possible criminal wrongdoing, including violations of the U.S. Tax
Code.
   Although the court papers unsealed Tuesday focus on Georgia
Power, Southern Co. and Arthur Andersen, Barr said other companies
or individuals may be involved. The affidavit says Southern
subsidiaries Mississippi Power Co. and Gulf Power Co. used proper
accounting procedures for spare parts.
   The Atlanta Constitution reported the investigation last week,
after Internal Revenue Service agents executed search warrants at
the downtown Atlanta headquarters of Georgia Power as well as the
home of Tim Fallaw, Southern Co.'s director of taxes.
   The Constitution said other companies being investigated include
Oglethorpe Power Co., which provides electricity to electric
cooperatives in the state.
   In a Tuesday afternoon news conference, Georgia Power chairman
Robert W. Scherer said the allegations ``if true (are) shocking to
me personally and I'm sure to the employees of Georgia Power.''
   Scherer said, ``I want to state as plainly as I can to you that
I will not tolerate wrongdoing and I will not tolerate the coverup
of wrongdoing at Georgia Power Co. and I personally will get to the
bottom of this matter.''
   Scherer said the accounting for spare parts is ``one of those
complex areas in the tax law that is open to legitimate
disagreement among reputable accountants.''
   The chairman refused to take questions.
   Southern Co. spokesman Gale Clappa said the holding company
would have nothing further to add to Scherer's statement. Officials
at Arthur Andersen's Atlanta office had no immediate comment on the
material.

<HEAD>Atari Files Suit Over Federated Group Acquisition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atari Corp. has filed a lawsuit charging
it was defrauded last year when it purchased Federated Group Inc.,
a retail electronics chain.
   In the suit, the personal computer and video game maker claimed
it was defrauded of $43 million when it bought Federated in August
1987 and completed the acquisition in October for $64.1 million in
cash.
   Atari charged that Wilfred Schwartz, Federated's former chairman
and principal stockholder, conspired with other Federated officers
to misrepresent the value of the company's assets.
   Atari also sued Ernst & Whinney, accountants for Federated at
the time of the acquisition, and Goldman Sachs & Co., the
investment banking firm that represented Federated in the
transaction.
   ``We stand behind our work,'' Don Howarth, a spokesman for New
York-based Ernst & Whinney, said on Tuesday.
   A spokesman for Goldman Sachs said the company would not comment
on the suit. Schwartz could not be reached for comment Tuesday.
   Atari filed the suit in U.S. District Court in San Jose on
Friday.
   Federated _ which operated 68 stores in California, Arizona, New
Mexico and Kansas _ was losing money at the time it was acquired.
Atari expected to engineer a quick turnaround of the company.
   However, Federated has continued to lose money, and Atari closed
six unprofitable stores of its new subsidiary. Federated lost $9.6
million on sales of $71.5 million during the quarter ended April 2.
   Joshua Tropper, corporate counsel for Atari, said after the
filing his company's auditors had detected $29 million in
discrepancies in the value of Federated's assets before going ahead
with the purchase. The last financial report before the Atari bid
showed Federated with assets of some $200 million.
   Tropper said Atari went ahead with the takeover after Schwartz
agreed to have outside auditors review Federated's books.
   Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting firm that performed the audit,
reported in February Federated's assets had been overstated by $43
million.
   Following the audit, Atari reduced the value of the Federated
assets by $43 million in its financial report for the first quarter.

   Becton Dickinson and Co. said Tuesday it will
sell its industrial glove business but keep its medical glove
business, whose sales and profits are booming because of the heavy
demand for gloves provoked by the AIDS crisis.
   The sale of the industrial-glove portion of the Edmont division
represents the last step in Becton Dickinson's drive to sell off
all non-medical portions of its business, a process that began in
1983.
   The industrial-glove portion of Edmont earned $10 million on
revenue of $105 million in the first nine months of its current
fiscal year, Becton Dickinson said. It will be put up for sale
through First Boston Corp.
   The smaller medical-glove portion of Edmont had revenue of $15
million in the nine-month period, up from $11 million in all of
fiscal 1987. Ronald Jasper, the head of investor relations, said
profits had grown as well, but declined to provide numbers.
   Becton Dickinson is based in Franklin Lakes, N.J.

<TEXT>
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. on
Tuesday approved a 4-for-1 stock swap as part of its plan to open
up ownership of its preferred stock to public investors and bring a
more than $1 billion windfall to the savings and loan industry.
   The corporation, known as Freddie Mac, is a congressionally
created entity that buys home mortgages from savings institutions
and other lenders and packages them into securities for resale to
investors, making more money available for home buyers.
   Ownership of Freddie Mac's 15 million preferred shares is
currently restricted to the 2,500 savings institutions who are
members of the Federal Home Loan Bank system.
   As part of an effort to bring new capital to the ailing
industry, federal regulators in July voted in principle to lift
restrictions on ownership of the preferred stock, which has no
voting power.
   The price of the stock, which was $60 a share in early June, has
soared. After Tuesday's announcment, spelling out details of how
the ownership restrictions will be lifted, the stock rose $6.50 a
share to $145 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Members of Congress, led by Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis.,
chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, had been pressing federal
regulators to funnel some of the windfall into the Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corp., the financially strapped fund that backs
deposits in savings institutions.
   Trade groups have opposed that, arguing it is important to bring
new capital to the healthy segment of the industry, which owns most
of the Freddie Mac stock.
   M. Danny Wall, the top federal S&L regulator and chairman of
Freddie Mac's board, repeated that regulators have decided
Proxmire's plan ``is clearly not going to be done.''
   Freddie Mac said it will offer four new shares of preferred
stock for each old share between Oct. 17 and Nov. 30. Public
investors would not be permitted to purchase the stock until after
Jan. 1.
   The corporation said it has retained the right to rescind the
entire exchange offer if fewer than two-thirds of the shares are
turned in. However, it approved two provisions designed to
encourage the exchange.
   Each new share will be guaranteed at least a fourth of the
dividends paid to an old share, but could receive more. Also, old
shares not exchanged before Nov. 30 could later be swapped for only
3.5 new shares.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contracting for new construction fell 5 percent
in July after spurting higher the previous two months, according to
a report Tuesday.
   The July decline was concentrated in the volatile public works
sector, the F.W. Dodge Group of McGraw-Hill Information Services
Co. said.
   F.W. Dodge said construction activity has been drifting downward
since last fall.
   ``Expectations for a lasting turn-around, which were none too
high before the latest round of credit restraint, have just been
lowered,'' George Christie, vice president and chief economist of
F.W. Dodge, said in a statement.
   Construction of manufacturing facilities continued to be strong
because of the ongoing squeeze on factory capacity, Christie said.
   The July level came to an annualized rate of $245.4 billion for
contracting for new construction.

<HEAD>Federal Agents Seize Documents at Northrop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigators have seized documents
related to Northrop Corp.'s work on the MX missile program, a
company spokesman said Tuesday.
   The documents were seized during a search last week at the
company's electronics division in Hawthorne, said Northrop
spokesman Tony Cantafio. He said the company was cooperating in the
investigation.
   ``Basically it related to contractual information concerning our
work on the MX,'' Cantafio said of the documents.
   The Los Angeles Times, quoting anonymous sources, reported
Tuesday the documents included an internal audit report on
purchasing problems and records on tests of a key MX guidance
component.
   Northrop's program to build the component, called an inertial
measurement unit, has been plagued with problems, including late
deliveries and allegations of overcharging and use of defective
parts.
   Officials at the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office refused to
comment on the search.
   About a month ago, authorities searched the home of former
Northrop employee Bryan Hyatt, one of several whistleblowers who
alleged the company used defective parts in the inertial
measurement units.
   Investigators sought documents ``relating to a purchasing fraud
with the MX and any coverup,'' Hyatt told the Times.
   Hyatt originally cooperated with the government, but since has
had a disagreement with investigators.
   Northrop has brought production of the inertial measurement unit
up to schedule, Cantafio said. As of July 31, the Pentagon was
withholding $20 million in payments for the units. That was down
from a high of $145 million withheld in December 1987 for slow
deliveries, Cantafio said.
   Northrop, one of the most scrutinized of military contractors,
is one of three Southern California aerospace companies whose
offices were searched last month in the nationwide investigation of
allegations that defense industry consultants bribed Pentagon
officials to win contracts. The company has said it is cooperating
in the probe.
   Also this summer, the U.S. Justice Department began an
investigation into Northrop's payment of more than $7 million to
Korean businesses in connection with attempts to sell its F-20
fighter jet to the South Korean military.
   Among Northrop's contracts is the new Stealth Bomber, the B-2,
being developed at its Palmdale plant.

<TEXT>
   The dollar held within a narrow range Tuesday,
slipping against all major currencies except the Japanese yen in
quiet dealings.
   Gold prices fell. Republic National Bank of New York said gold
was bid at $428.35 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $429.40
late Monday.
   The dollar moved lower in early domestic dealings after the
Commerce Department reported its Index of Leading Economic
Indicators fell 0.8 percent in July, the largest drop in eight
months.
   The number was slightly weaker than expected, but the market
soon shrugged off the figure. Traders said there was no reaction to
a separate report that showed factory orders down 3.5 percent in
July, the worst drop in 18 months.
   ``We're entrenched in a narrow range,'' said Joseph Cally, a
trader at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The only interesting move during the session came against the
Japanese yen. The dollar briefly pierced the key 135 level against
the yen before settling lower. Traders said a rumor that Japan
planned to tax certain stock-trading profits weakened the Japanese
currency.
   ``The market is very much trying to get its claws into something
that will give it a new sense of direction, but until that comes,
we'll just kind of flake around,'' said Ron Sapiro, head trader at
Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. in Chicago.
   European traders said they were looking to Friday's unemployment
data for July to liven the currency markets.
   But Sapiro noted many traders may not participate in dealings
Friday as they get a jump on the long Labor Day weekend. ``Any
reaction might just be an exaggeration,'' Sapiro said.
   Traders also are concerned that any significant upward move by
the dollar will probably be met with a new round of central bank
intervention. According to an analyst in London, ``The dollar is
caught between the possibility of interest rates going up and the
certainty of central bank intervention.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.19 yen to a closing 134.39. Later in London, it
was quoted at 134.45 yen. In New York, the dollar rose to 134.93
yen, from 134.54 yen on Monday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6910, slightly more
expensive for buyers than $1.6840 quoted in European markets late
Monday. London's financial markets were closed Monday for a bank
holiday.
   In New York it cost $1.6875 to buy one pound, more expensive
than Monday's $1.6809.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday,
included: 1.8664 West German marks, down from 1.8720; 1.5765 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5778; 6.3385 French francs, down from 6.3420;
1,3860.00 Italian lire, down from 1,390.50, and 1.2362 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.2386.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday,
included: 1.8678 West German marks, down from 1.8693; 1.5760 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5772; 6.3385 French francs, down from 6.3500;
2.1080 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1120; 1,387.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,389.50, and 1.2386 Canadian dollars, down from 1.23935.
   Gold bullion for current delivery slipped to $428.80 a troy
ounce on the New York Commodity Exchange, from $429.40 at Monday's
close.
   In London, gold fell to a late bid price of $428.10 a troy
ounce, from $431.40 bid late Friday, before the three-day holiday
weekend. In Zurich, gold closed at a bid $428.50 an ounce, compared
with $432 late Monday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, where financial markets were closed Monday
for a national holiday, gold fell $2.68 an ounce from Friday's
$432.56.
   Silver bullion for current delivery fell to $6.490 a troy ounce
on the Commodity Exchange, from $6.520 on Monday. Silver also fell
in London, where the metal was trading at a late bid price of $6.55
a troy ounce, compared with Friday's $6.64.

<HEAD>Continental Introduces Money-Back Guarantee; New Companion Fare</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines, seeking to lure business
travelers wary of its reputation for poor service, on Tuesday
announced a new money-back service guarantee for first-class
passengers.
   Under the program, effective Sept. 19 through Oct. 31,
first-class fliers can get a refund of as much as $200 if they are
not satisfied with any aspect of their domestic flights, from
making reservations to claiming their baggage when they arrive.
   Continental said the unconditional service refund is the first
such guarantee offered by a U.S. airline. Passengers are entitled
to a refund if they are unhappy with in-flight meals, if flights
are delayed or for any other reason.
   ``There are no questions asked; there's no fine print,''
Continental President Martin Shugrue told a news conference.
``We're willing to put our money on the line.''
   Houston-based Continental, a subsidiary of giant Texas Air
Corp., generally is known for its aggressive fare cutting.
   Shugrue conceded it was no secret that Continental suffered from
a reputation for inferior service. However, he said, the airline
has improved its on-time performance so it now ranks third among
the major carriers, according to government statistics. The airline
was in last place this past winter.
   The airline's poor service record ``is all history,'' Shugrue
said. ``We have total confidence in our service product.''
   Continental also announced a new fare of $79 each way for
companions of passengers traveling on its MaxSaver discount fares
anywhere in the mainland United States. The companion fare can be
used for travel between Sept. 7 and Dec. 15.
   A $79 companion fare also was announced by Miami-based Eastern
Airlines, the other major carrier owned by Texas Air. Eastern said
the new Companion MaxSaver, valid during the same period, will
reduce the cost of two people traveling together by more than 30
percent.
   Northwest Airlines, a competitor, said it was matching the $79
companion fares for vacation travelers ``who are looking for a fall
fling.''
   Continental also introduced a 10 percent discount for passengers
over age 65 for travel within the U.S. mainland, and two year-long
tickets for senior citizens allowing unlimited travel within the
mainland for $1,299 and worldwide for $2,299.
   In addition, Continental said it is cutting its unrestricted
fares by as much as 70 percent and simplifying its price structure
on nonstop flights between Denver and 38 cities. Continental is
striving to increase its market share in Denver, one of its major
hubs.
   Chicago-based United Airlines, Continental's main competitor in
Denver, said Tuesday it planned to match fare cuts in that market.
   Under the money-back guarantee, passengers must submit a refund
form available from ticket agents. Fliers will receive refund
checks in about six to eight weeks, Continental said. The offer is
limited to three refunds per passenger.
   Shugrue said there is a strong possibility the guarantee program
could be extended beyond the Oct. 31 expiration.
   Passengers who paid $500 to $699 for first-class, round-trip
tickets are eligible for a $100 refund. Fliers who paid $700 to
$899 can get back $150, and those paying more than $900 are
entitled to $200.

   Braniff Inc., continuing to fill the
void left by planned cutbacks by Eastern Airlines, said Tuesday it
will add new non-stop flights from Kansas City to three cities
beginning Oct. 1.
   The airline will add three flights to Tulsa, Okla., and one each
to Tucson, Ariz., and Orlando, Fla., said Don McGuire, Braniff's
vice president of public relations.
   Braniff also will add a flight to Los Angeles, which it already
serves.
   Braniff currently has 50 daily departures from Kansas City
International Airport and is adding 26 flights on Sept. 12. McGuire
said that by Oct. 1, Braniff will have 82 daily departures from KCI.
   The airline has expanded its operations out of Kansas City to
fill the routes that will be left when Eastern Airlines cuts all
but six of its 53 departures from the Kansas City airport.

<HEAD>Lower Price Drawing Higher Interest In Offshore Oil Lease Sale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN McGILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government is scheduled to open
Wednesday 371 bids made by oil companies hoping to snap up 270
tracts of bargain-priced oil properties in the western Gulf of
Mexico.
   It will be the third Gulf lease sale since the Interior
Department dropped the minimum per-acre price on the property from
$150 to $25. And it's the second time western Gulf tracts are up
for bids.
   Interest appeared high, with 93 companies qualifiying to bid.
Eighty-four qualified for the central Gulf sale last March.
   However, when the number of bids actually was totaled Tuesday
afternoon, it was far below the 931 bids received last March for
the central Gulf properties.
   Eileen Angelico, spokeswoman for the Interior Department's
Minerals Management Service, said the number was down for two
reasons.
   First, the central Gulf waters are considered to be better oil
properties. Second, the western gulf tracts were up for bids a year
ago shortly after the minimum bids were lowered to $25 per acre.
Almost 520 bids were received on the tracts then.
   The lower price is still seen as a means of boosting interest in
the offshore tracts, Angelico said. ``We see it as an incentive to
the smaller companies,'' she said.
   The western gulf territory covers about 5,080 underwater blocks
covering about 27.9 million acres, mostly off the Texas coast but
some in deep waters off the Louisiana shore.
   Louisiana and Texas are both suffering economically from the
domestic oil industry's depression and renewed interest in offshore
leases was hailed as good news by industry representatives at the
March sale.
   But a spokesman for one company cautions that the sale of more
leases won't necessarily be followed by more drilling.
   ``That's driven more by other things,'' said Billy Vehnekamp,
public affairs manager for Shell's New Orleans office.
   The government gives the lease purchasers several years _ the
number varies according to the type and location of the tract _ to
exercise drilling rights, Vehnekamp said.
   Drilling costs, prices for the product and numerous other market
factors come into play, he said.
   Bids will be opened beginning at 9 a.m. Wednesday at the
Marriott Hotel in downtown New Orleans.

<HEAD>Settlement Said Near In Champion Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Negotiators on Tuesday reached a tentative
agreement that could end a strike by about 2,400 Champion
International Corp. wood products workers in Oregon, Washington and
Montana.
   Bill Hubbell, president of the International Woodworkers of
America-U.S., refused comment on the offer, which is subject to
approval by the IWA and the Western Council of Industrial Workers.
   Ratification votes would be complete and results would be
announced by Saturday, said Hubbell. He refused to speculate on the
offer's chances of approval.
   If the Champion workers settle, only about 1,800 workers would
remain off the job in the Northwest timber strike that began June
6. At its peak, the walkout idled about 9,000 workers in five
states.
   Workers are still striking at DAW Forest Products Inc., WI
Forest Products Inc., Lakeview Lumber Co. and Morgan Products Ltd.
   On Monday, non-striking workers narrowly approved a contract
agreement with Georgia Pacific Corp. in Oregon and Washington.
   In another development, Weyerhaeuser Co. representatives said
they were scheduled to meet with union bargainers in Portland on
Thursday. About 6,000 Weyerhaeuser workers in the region were not
affected by the walkout.
   Mike Draper, executive officer of the Western Council of
Industrial Workers, and Hubbell said the Georgia-Pacific
ratification vote was quite close, but neither official would
release any numbers or percentages on the balloting.
   Dave Odgers, a Georgia-Pacific spokesman, said the new pact is
similar to the recent agreement involving Willamette Industries
Inc., which has produced a pattern for settlements in the industry.
   Odgers said the Georgia-Pacific contract calls for a $1,400
bonus in the first year, with basic pay increases of 11 percent
over the remaining length of the four-year agreement.
   The contract covers 700 workes at mill operations in
Springfield, Coquille and Lebanon and 500 in a two-mill complex in
Martell, Calif.
   Besides Georgia-Pacific and Willamette Industries, other major
companies that have settled with the unions are Boise Cascade Corp.
and Simpson Timber Co.

<HEAD>U.S. Shoe Reports $9 Million Loss in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Shoe Corp., currently considering
restructuring or a possible sale of the company, said Tuesday it
lost $9.4 million during its second quarter.
   The retailer and shoe manufacturer's loss in the quarter ended
July 30 compared with earnings of $5.5 million, or 12 cents a
share, in the comparable period a year earlier.
   The company reported sales of $544.4 million, up from $511.1
million a year earlier.
   U.S. Shoe has been hit hard by the slump in apparel sales. The
company has hired Merrill Lynch Capital Markets to suggest ways to
maximize its shareholder value, including the possible
restructuring or sale of all or parts of the company.
   The company, which has been mentioned as a prime takeover
target, said its results reflected a one-time gain of $7.3 million
from the sale of several divisions and $3.1 million in charges,
partly attributable to the closing of stores in Chicago, Atlanta
and Indianapolis.
   U.S. Shoe's 1,700 specialty stores include Casual Corner, Ups 'N
Downs, Caren Charles and Lenscrafters. It also manufacturers shoes
under labels including Selby, Red Cross, Cobbies, Pappagallo and
Socialites.
   For the first six months, U.S. Shoe reported a loss of $6.3
million, against year-earlier earnings of $29.6 million, or 66
cents a share. The 1987 figure includes a $16 million gain from an
accounting change.
   First-half sales totaled $1.07 billion, up from $1.02 billion.

   A federal judge on Tuesday stopped Eastern
Airlines from firing 4,000 employees but allowed the financially
strapped carrier to go ahead with cutting back service to 14 cities
on Wednesday as planned.
   Eastern said it will go ahead with the cuts. Its hub in Kansas
City will be eliminated and flights will be cut from 53 to 6, said
spokeswoman Paula Musto.
   ``Massive layoffs are not, and shall never be business as
usual,'' U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker said in a 50-page
opinion. ``The Railway Labor Act requires Eastern to bargain with
its unions before taking unilateral action to eliminate 12 percent
of its workforce.''
   He signed a preliminary injunction that bars Eastern from
``altering in any way the status quo working condition of Eastern's
pilots, machinists and flight attendants.'' A trial in the matter
will be scheduled later.
   Eastern President Phil Bakes called the decision ``gravely
wrong'' and said the carrier would file an emergency appeal.
   ``Eastern, like any American business, must be allowed to prune
money-losing operations,'' Bakes said in a statement released at
Eastern's headquarters in Miami. ``We must be able to take prudent,
although sometimes painful, measures in the best interests of the
company and our employees.''
   Lawyers for the three unions that brought the court action
against Eastern submitted financial statements and Parker ordered
bonds of $25,000 each to indemnify the airline if the decision is
reversed.
   Meantime, the airline said, ``Eastern's basic fall schedule
remains intact. Travel agents and pasengers can continue to book
flights with full confidence that the schedule will be as
announced.''
   ``This is a case of protecting work and protecting jobs,'' said
James Linsey, an attorney for Air Line Pilots Association. He said
the decision ``doesn't second-guess the business decisions of
Eastern Airlines to fly from Point A to Point B or to limit service
in particular cities.''
   Asked what Eastern might do with thousands of employees it
claims not to need, Linsey replied: ``They get transferred, like
any company transfers employees from one plant to another.''
   Parker wrote that Texas Air Corp., which bought Eastern in 1986,
``has exerted every effort to curb union influence at Eastern and
to reduce wage rates and economic benefits previously obtained.''
   He said there were many ``indications of anti-union bias'' and
that Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air, had expressed that view
on many occasions.
   ``Since the acquisition of Eastern by Texas Air, Eastern's
management has contributed to Eastern's financial instability,''
the judge wrote. ``Through a series of business decisions,
management has led the company into a number of questionable loans
and questionable ventures which have drained off cash reserves and
other assets.''
   The centerpiece of the opinion was that Eastern could not
proceed with the mass firings. Parker did not dwell on the
airline's plans to close its Kansas City hub and cut service to 14
cities.
   The airline claimed it would save $50 million by the service
terminations and $7 million in payroll. It would cut 140 of its
1,225 daily flights and sell between 33 and 41 airplanes.
   The cities Eastern targeted to cut are Albuquerque, N.M.; Fort
de France, Martinique; Las Vegas, Nev.; Minneapolis-St. Paul;
Oklahoma City; Omaha, Neb.; Dallas; Pointe-a-Pitre, Guadeloupe;
Reno, Nev.; San Antonio, Texas; San Diego; St. Lucia, West Indies;
Tucson, Ariz., and Tulsa, Okla.
   Parker wrote that Eastern has shown through testimony that it
has the right to change schedules, reduce flights and close its
Kansas City hub as proposed ``without first bargaining with the
plaintiffs.'' He said there is no question that the cutbacks ``are
motivated by sound financial reasons.''
   Bill Scheri, airline coordinator for the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, told reporters:
   ``This tells us one thing. That union-buster Mr. Frank Lorenzo
is not above the law of the land ... Mr. Lorenzo and his
hand-picked lieutenants cannot lay off 4,000 employees.''
   Scheri said the seven days of hearings that resulted in the
judge's ruling exposed ``that Mr. Lorenzo and company were not
really trying to keep Eastern Air Lines in business but to
dismantle it and transfer assets and destroy three labor unions.''
   Parker wrote, however, that just because the cutbacks are
necessary economically does not mean Eastern can bypass bargaining
with its unions.
   ``While it is true that the collective bargaining agreements
contain furlough provisions, they provide no justification for a
wholesale restructuring of the airline work force,'' he said.
   Among the employees Eastern wanted for lay off are 1,000 flight
attendants, 1,000 machinists and 500 pilots, the ruling said. The
other workers affected by the order were not specified. The flight
attendants are represented by the Transport Workers Union of
America, which Joined ALPA and the Machinists union in the suit.
   Parker had issued a temporary restraining order against the
furloughs on Aug. 4 and extended it last Friday.
   In his ruling Tuesday, he cited a Supreme Court ruling that many
business decisions are subject to bargaining, including management
actions taken to eliminate wasteful practices.
   The labor agreements Eastern made with its unions ``provide no
justification for a wholesale restructuring of the airline
workforce,'' Parker wrote.
   ``Employers subject to the RLA (Railway Labor Act) must bargain
with their unions even over fundamental decisions affecting the
very scope and direction of their employer's enterprise.''
   The unions brought their suit under the Railway Labor Act, which
requires carriers and the bargaining representatives of labor to
preserve and maintain working conditions that exist before a labor
dispute.

<HEAD>Public Service of New Mexico Cutting 19.4 Percent Of Workforce</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Public Service Company of New Mexico
laid off 656 employees Tuesday, or 15.9 percent of its workforce,
in the latest cutbacks under a major cost-cutting program.
   The state's largest utility had 4,126 full-time positions before
the job eliminations. Tuesday's cuts boosted job eliminations to
19.4 percent of its workforce, and followed the layoffs of 129
union workers from PNM's electrical operations and the elimination
of all 14 jobs in its aviation department.
   ``Our goal is to have earnings such that we can continue
dividends and regain our financial health,'' said Jerry Geist, PNM
president and chairman.
   Geist said jobs were cut from operations across the state and
from all levels of the company, including 30 percent reductions in
the corporate office.
   He said the job cuts would save $28.4 million in salaries, wages
and benefits a year and that non-labor cost-cutting measures would
save $15.4 million.
   PNM officials also announced construction expenses were cut by
$19 million in 1988 and $33.6 million in budgeted 1989 levels.
   Geist said PNM dropped its employee stock purchase plan and
imposed an across-the-board salary freeze until the middle of next
year. Executive salaries and benefits were cut in January, so the
latest salary freeze is an extended freeze for PNM officials, he
said.
   Geist said Tuesday actions would not affect the reliability or
safety of electrical or gas service, but would slow the utility's
response time for things such as requests for new service.
   The utility's financial problems over the past year are largely
due to a huge excess generating capacity. Its share of costs of the
Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station in Arizona and a unit of the
coal-fired San Juan Generating Station near Farmington are not
included in its rates.
   Earnings dropped 38 percent between 1986 and 1987 and have
continued dropping this year, Geist said. Shareholder dividends
have been cut by nearly 50 percent, he said.
   PNM's stock, which climbed to a high of $39 in early 1987, rose
$1.25 to $13.75 a share Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
