   A spate of ``drive-by'' shootings killed four
people and injured nine others over the weekend, police said.
   One woman was killed and six people were injured in the
gang-style attacks Sunday, while three men were killed and three
others injured in shootings the day before, police said.
   An unidentified woman was found at 1:45 p.m. Sunday in south
central Los Angeles and pronounced dead at Los Angeles County-USC
Medical Center, said Sgt. Steve LaRoche.
   Despite a police crackdown on gangs beginning earlier this year,
deaths from drive-by shootings, a form of attack favored by the
gangs, average one a day in the Los Angeles area, authorities have
said. The violence is most serious on the weekends.
   Two reputed gang members were arrested in one of the shootings,
a Saturday attack that left another suspected gang member dead.
Detectives were trying to determine if the other attacks were
linked and if they were also gang-related, Leap said.
   In the first of Sunday's four attacks, three men and a woman
were hit by bullets as they sat outside playing dominoes around
2:25 a.m. near downtown Los Angeles.
   About 30 minutes later and 2{ miles away, an unidentified man
was struck by shots fired from a passing car, Leap said. Five
minutes later, a man about five blocks away was hit by a shotgun
blast fired from a car, police said.
   Late Saturday afternoon, two men were shot to death near a
barber shop in Baldwin Park, 10 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.
   More than 12 hours earlier, a suspected gang member was killed
and a teen-ager was critically injured when gunfire burst from a
car as the two stood on a Los Angeles sidewalk, said police
Detective Robert Suter.
   Two reputed rival gang members, both in their teens, were
arrested booked for investigation of murder. Police said ``bad
blood'' between the gangs apparently prompted the shooting.
   Meanwhile, Harbor area police arrested a man for investigation
of a 4:15 p.m. Saturday drive-by shooting that injured two men,
said Sgt. Bill Snyder. One of the victims was shot in the face and
the other was shot in the back.

   An elderly man regarded by neighbors
as a poor, eccentric loner died when fire swept through his mobile
home and left behind a trove of coins, some of them gold and silver.
   Andrew Baca, 75, was found dead in a kitchen chair by
firefighters after a Saturday morning blaze at his home in this
Central Florida town. An autopsy showed he died of smoke inhalation
and third-degree burns, authorities said.
   The blaze ignited a propane tank and exploded bullets in the
home, forcing the authorities to evacuate 30 surrounding homes and
injuring one firefighter. Mike Jacobs, 30, was treated at a nearby
hospital for an apparent bullet wound to his right foot.
   After dousing the blaze, firefighters and police searched the
ruins and found thousands of coins, including some from the Orient,
the Caribbean and Africa, and mint sets from the U.S. Treasury.
   The haul, which filled six large metal garbage cans, was taken
to the Lake County Sheriff's Office in a pickup truck for
safekeeping, said a woman at the sheriff's office who declined to
be identified. Authorities said they didn't know how much the coins
were worth.
   George Baca, of Pittsburgh, said by telephone Saturday that his
brother was a speculator who owned the coins for years and planned
to sell them for a profit eventually.
   But news of the cache stunned neighbors, who described Baca as
an eccentric loner so tight with his money that he drew his
electricity through an extension cord hooked up to the trailer next
door.
   Junk was piled so high in his yard that it nearly obscured his
small mobile home from view and neighbors frequently complained
that his yard was a haven for rats and snakes.
   Inside, the home was cluttered by tall stacks of newspapers and
books, washing machines, lawn mowers, mattresses and ``you name
it,'' said neighbor Laura Trumble, 70.
   When people asked Baca to fix up his home, he always grumbled,
``It doesn't bother me,'' Mrs. Trumble said.

   Police hurled tear gas and kicked and
beat protesters with rifle butts Sunday to disperse thousands of
people in one of the largest rallies ever against the leftist
Sandinista government.
   The official Voice of Nicaragua said 10 police officers were
injured in the hourlong protest but did not give any figures for
civilian casualties in this small city about 40 miles south of
Managua, the capital. It said 38 protesters were detained.
   President Daniel Ortega told reporters later the government
would act ``with total firmness'' against protesters. He said
Sunday's demonstration was part of a U.S. plan to destabilize the
government.
   ``We cannot continue being tolerant with those who want to take
advantage of the (political) space,'' Ortega said, referring to
recent freedoms accorded to anti-government groups in Nicaragua.
   Ortega made his comments after visiting the family of a
Sandinista youth organization member who authorities said was
killed Saturday when the car he was riding in was ambushed by
U.S.-backed rebels.
   The violence erupted after an estimated 10,000 protesters
marched several blocks along the city's mud-covered streets.
   The marchers, some carying signs saying: ``Democracy Yes,
Communism No,'' then gathered in an open field for speeches.
Witnesses said police began pushing and shoving at the back of the
crowd.
   People suddenly started screaming and running for cover as
police, wearing gas masks and carrying AK-47 rifles, lobbed tear
gas canisters into the crowd. Groups of protesters grabbed stones
and sticks and started hurling them at police. ``You murderous
dogs!'' one man yelled.
   Police beat several people with their fists, feet and rifle
butts. One man stood stunned, blood dripping down his face, his
arms cut.
   Witnesses said police threw one of the rally organizers, Carlos
Huembes, to the ground, then punched and kicked him.
   Plainclothes security agents confiscated film from several
photographers, including one from The Associated Press.
   Scores of heavily armed police in four-wheel drive vehicles and
pickup trucks had stood guard before the violence erupted.
   ``We're here to make sure that order is kept,'' an officer said.
   A state security officer told the AP later that police had used
tear gas in response to stone-throwing by the protesters.
   The demonstration, one of the largest yet against the leftist
government, was organized by the Democratic Coordinate, an umbrella
group for anti-government political parties and trade organizations.
   It was authorized by the government, which staged its own
pro-Sandinista demonstration in the town over the weekend.
   ``This is to show the people want democracy,'' said protester
Myriam Arguello, secretary-general of the anti-government
Conservative Party, only minutes before the violence erupted.
   Roger Guevara, secretary of the Coordinate, said in a statement
that Huembes and two other members of the organization were among
those detained Sunday night. The statement identified the two as
Agustin Jarquin Anaya and Adan Fletes of the Social Christian party.
   Public discontent with the Sandinistas has increased this year
as Nicaragua's economy worsens and the government's war against
U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras, remains unsettled.
   The government claims the Reagan administration has been
attempting to stir up discontent in Nicaragua.
   The Sandinista newspaper Barricada ran a headline Sunday with a
warning to the U.S. Embassy: ``Don't Provoke The Ire of the
People.''
   The Sandinista government was established in July 1979 after a
civil war toppled the rightist government of Anastasio Somoza.

   The last two fugitives among eight inmates
who escaped from the Kentucky State Penitentiary last month were
apprehended at a hotel in Juarez, Mexico, on Sunday, the FBI said.
   James Blanton, 29, and Derek Quintero, 26, were arrested without
incident by heavily armed Mexican police in their room at the Sante
Fe Hotel around 1 p.m., FBI agent Gary Webb said.
   After being returned to the United States, the two were being
held at the El Paso County Detention Facility on Sunday afternoon
on federal charges of unlawful flight to avoid confinement, Webb
said. They also face Kentucky state charges of second-degree escape.
   Blanton was serving a 48-year sentence for murder and Quintero
was serving 37 years for robbery and kidnapping. They were the last
to be captured of eight who sawed their way out of the Eddyville,
Ky., prison June 16.
   Last Wednesday, fellow escapee Billy Hall, 25, of Paducah, Ky.,
was arrested by FBI agents inside an El Paso Western Union office.
Hall, serving 23 years for burglary and assault, waived extradition
to Kentucky and returned to the prison in Eddyville on Saturday.
   At the time of his arrest, Hall was carrying some scraps of
paper that mentioned the Mexican hotel, Webb said, and the
information was turned over to Mexican authorities. In addition, a
couple who saw news stories about Hall's capture reported sighting
the other two fugitives at the hotel, the FBI said.
   However, police and the military in Mexico were involved in
elections and could not act on the information until Sunday, Webb
said.
   After they took the two into custody, Mexican authorities turned
them over to U.S. authorities as undesirable aliens, Webb said.
   Blanton and Quintero were to appear in court on Monday.
Extradition would be worked out between authorities in Texas and
Kentucky, Webb said.
   Hall has been indicted and warrants have been issued against
Blanton and Quintero in the shooting deaths of Buford Vester Jr.,
71, and his wife, Myrtle Estelle Vester, 69, shortly after the
escape. Their bodies were found in their home near Dover, Tenn.,
about 50 miles south of the prison.
   The couple's car, with a 20-gauge shotgun inside, was found the
next day about 150 miles away in Memphis.

   The Soviet Union's top-ranking military
officer saw traditional Indian dancing and an old-fashioned cowboy
shoot-'em-up Saturday on a whirlwind visit to Oklahoma after
protesters in Texas told his delegation to ``Go home, murderers.''
   Soviet Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev and his group also got to
see cattle roping, trick roping and square dancing as the state
provided the visitors with a taste of Western heritage.
   This is the first visit of the ranking Soviet military leader to
the United States. The weeklong tour of several cities is designed
to give the Soviet officers the chance to see typical American life
in addition to the military aspects.
   ``The times really have been changing for the better, and are
changing for the better, because of the politically courageous
decisions by our two political leaders,'' Ahkromeyev said shortly
before the evening ended. ``We need to carry out and maintain a
stable and friendly relationship.''
   Saturday morning, when the Soviet delegation was at the Alamo in
San Antonio, two demonstrators told Akhromeyev that he did not
belong at Texas' most famous shrine. But Akhromeyev's visit there
was more peaceful than the greeting he received upon his arrival in
San Antonio on Friday night.
   About 50 demonstrators chanted ``Go home, murderers!'' when
Akhromeyev and several other Soviet officers showed up at the
Institute of Texan Cultures.
   ``I feel it's really a crime to invite these killers here when
they are committing genocide in Afghanistan and terrorism around
the world,'' said Sayed Nasir, a mechanical engineer from
Afghanistan.
   Oklahoma Gov. Henry Bellmon was host for Saturday evening's
entertainment. During the festivities, Akhromeyev was presented
with an Indian headdress, and he and several other Soviet officials
were invited to try their hand at branding some cattle. None took
up the offer.
   Ten-year-old Charlie Ward was one of a group of youngsters who
took part in a trick roping demonstration for the entourage. ``It
made me feel good,'' he said afterward. ``It's the kind of
friendship between the Soviets and Americans, getting to know
them.''
   Earlier in the day, Akhromeyev and U.S. Adm. William Crowe,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, toured the University of
Oklahoma campus. Crowe is a native of Oklahoma.
   ``I think it's a positive thing that these two guys can
communicate on all levels,'' said an onlooker, Neil Kingsley.
``They seem to understand each other.''

   Members of Centuria High School's tiny

service Saturday for Navy Capt. William E. Nordeen, victim of a
terrorist bombing in Greece.
   Nordeen, 51, a military attache at the U.S. Embassy in Athens,
was killed June 28 when a bomb destroyed his car. A leftist
organization called November 17 said it was responsible.
   He was buried Wednesday at Arlington National Cemetery.
   Those attending Saturday's 40-minute memorial service included
Nordeen's mother, Edna Capello, his sister Carla Anderson, both of
Centuria, and most of the 15 students who graduated in his high
school class 34 years ago.
   Centuria is a town of about 700 people in northwestern Wisconsin.

<HEAD>Khmer Rouge Agrees To Dissolve, Sihanouk Claims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The notorious Khmer Rouge has agreed to
dissolve as part of a settlement to end the war in Cambodia,
resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk was reported as saying.
   The Khmer Rouge, blamed for killing hundreds of thousands of
Cambodians during its 1975-78 reign, is one of three guerrilla
groups opposing Cambodia's Vietnam-backed government.
   Sihanouk was reported as saying that he was told by Khieu
Samphan, the Khmer Rouge's nominal leader, that the group would
dissolve. The secretive Khmer Rouge has not previously clearly
spelled out its position.
   Vietnam has said it will pull its estimated 140,000 troops out
of Cambodia by 1990 and has begun withdrawing 50,000 troops in an
operation to be completed in December.
   ``Previously, Khieu Samphan said the Phnom Penh regime should be
dissolved but not his,'' the prince was reported as saying during a
visit to his base on the Thai-Cambodian border on June 29. ``Two
days ago he came to see me and said he agreed that the two regimes
should be dissolved.''
   Resistance radio carried Sihanouk's address at the Site B
refugee camp, and a text was obtained Sunday from a Western embassy
in Bangkok.
   During its rule, the Khmer Rouge regime of Prime Minister Pol
Pot set up a vast network of slave labor camps and execution
chambers and attempted to set up a harsh communist society.
   After Vietnamese forces invaded and ousted the regime, the Khmer
Rouge joined Sihanouk and a third resistance group to form an
anti-Vietnamese guerrilla coalition.
   Wide agreement that the Khmer Rouge must not return to power was
reached at annual talks this past week between foreign ministers of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and their counterparts
of Western countries and Japan.
   After a Vietnamese withdrawal, the solution most widely accepted
by these countries is formation of a coalition government headed by
Sihanouk and including the Khmer Rouge, the pro-Vietnamese regime
of Prime Minister Hun Sen, and Son Sann's Khmer People's National
Liberation Front. This coalition would oversee general elections.
   Hun Sen has rejected dissolution of his regime, however, and
insisted that the guerrilla groups join his government.
   According to the text of his remarks, Sihanouk said he told
Khieu Samphan that even after the Sihanouk party won the elections,
``we will still call on the other three sides to join us in a
quadripartite government forever to ensure our unity, security,
national union.''
   ``This is what I said to Khieu Samphan, who replied: `Thank you,
Thank you,''' Sihanouk said.
   The prince repeated, however, that after a Vietnamese pullout,
an international peacekeeping force must stay in Cambodia for at
least five years ``so that the Khmer Rouge cannot maltreat us.''

   Opposition candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas
claimed victory in Mexico's presidential elections Saturday, a day
before the government planned to release the official results.
   ``We have won the presidential elections,'' the National
Democratic Front candidate said. ``We will not recognize
authorities that might rise out of electoral fraud.''
   There was no immediate response from the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party or its candidate, Carlos Salinas de Gortari,
which have also claimed victory.
   Cardenas told reporters he had won 10 of 31 states and the
Federal District, which includes Mexico City.
   He said his victory claim was based on projections drawn from
results leaked by the government and his left-of-center coalition's
own count of 6.7 million votes. Mexico has more than 38 million
registered voters.
   Cardenas said he would win with 38.8 percent of the vote.
   He said Salinas would have 32.69 percent, winning five states,
and conservative National Action Party candidate Manuel Clouthier
would be third with 25.5 percent of the vote, winning in five
states.
   The Federal Election Commission said Saturday it would give the
final, official results from the presidential and congressional
races to the political parties on Sunday.
   While Cardenas and the governing party both claimed victory,
Clouthier said Saturday he was ahead in the national vote count. He
also announced a series of nationwide protests against fraud.
   ``I summon you to declare yourselves in civil resistance from
this moment on,'' Clouthier said told tens of thousands of
supporters in Mexico City's huge main plaza.
   In northern Mexico, hundreds of National Action Party backers
occupied one of four international bridges linking Ciudad Juarez
with El Paso, Texas, Saturday night in a driving rainstorm. They
vowed to remain until official election results were announced.
   The party claimed it had taken four districts in Juarez from
Institutional Revolutionary Party.
   Clouthier said Institutional Revolutionary Party was now ``the
third political force in the country.''
   His campaign manager, Francisco Gonzalez Garza, said the
National Action Party tally showed Clouthier winning at least four
senate seats and 12 of Mexico City's 40 voting districts.
   The Institutional Revolutionary Party also released results
Saturday from what it said was 6.7 million votes.
   The governing party said the results showed Salinas leading with
48.69 percent of the vote, Cardenas second with 27.16 percent and
Clouthier third with 18.95 percent.
   Cardenas had earlier claimed winning the capital, home to a
fourth of Mexico's 80 million people, and Institutional
Revolutionary Party officials said privately they might have to
concede the capital and the states of Michoacan, Morelos and Mexico
to him.
   The Institutional Revolutionary Party has not lost a
presidential, gubernatorial or senate race since it was founded in
1929.
   Like Clouthier, Cardenas accused the governing party of
widespread fraud in the elections.
   Cardenas earlier accused the governing party of trying to steal
his Mexico City triumph by demanding a recount in the Federal
District or seeking to nullify his votes.
   ``I call upon the president of the republic and candidate Carlos
Salinas de Gortari to comply with their word and their commitment
to preserve the legality of this electoral process,'' he said.
   The Institutional Revolutionary Party has ordered local election
officials in the capital to file formal complaints about what it
claims are multiple votes for Cardenas, the government newspaper El
Nacional said Saturday.
   Cardenas is on the ballot as the candidate of three parties.
After these parties officially unified behind him, the
Institutional Revolutionary Party-dominated election commission
rejected a Cardenas request to list him only once.
   The Institutional Revolutionary Party is claiming thousands of
voters marked several party symbols on their ballot to vote for
Cardenas and that each mark was counted as a separate vote.
   The opposition and citizen watchdog groups have been accusing
the governing party of vote fraud since the polls closed on
Wednesday.
   The Assembly for Effective Suffrage, a watchdog group, said it
found 1,100 irregularities ranging from ballot-stuffing and
tampering with voter rolls.
   Alfonso Bravo, of the Citizen's Assembly, reported
irregularities in 20 percent of the nearly 28,000 voting booths it
had monitored.

<HEAD>Dukakis Apparently Sitting Out Nightline Interview</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis' staff broke off negotiations
for an interview on ABC News' ``Nightline'' after the show's host,
Ted Koppel, refused to allow the Democratic presidential candidate
to appear on the set with him, a newspaper reported.
   The Massachusetts governor's campaign staff wanted to avoid a
situation like that faced by Vice President George Bush, who
participated in a one-hour interview with Koppel last month, the
Daily News reported in Sunday's editions.
   During that interview, Bush, the probable Republican nominee,
was in Houston while Koppel anchored the show from Washington, D.C.
   The interview included a few slip-ups on the vice president's
part, when he called Koppel ``Dan,'' apparently referring to CBS
news anchorman Dan Rather. Rather interviewed Bush live in January,
and a heated confrontation ensued.
   During the ``Nightline'' interview, Bush's media adviser Roger
Ailes finally had to resort to hanging a sign labeled ``Ted'' on
the camera, according to the Daily News.
   With rare exceptions, Koppel insists that he be separated from
his guests, with each side speaking directly into a camera. The
set-up ensures that no guest has an unfair advantage over another,
either through the use of body language or eye contact.
   However, an ABC News source says Dukakis' press secretary,
Leslie Dach, wants Koppel and Dukakis to appear together on the
same set during the interview, the News reported.
   Koppel's rule has been broken when ``Nightline'' wants the
interview badly enough. One notable exception was an interview last
fall with former Democratic presidential contender Gary Hart, in
which Koppel and Hart sat together. The occasion marked Hart's
first interview after withdrawing from the race.

   Teamsters President Jackie Presser, who
led the renegade union back into the mainstream of organized labor
but extended its reputation for corruption, died Saturday night
after a battle with cancer.
   Presser, 61, underwent surgery for brain cancer in May and was
entered Lakewood Hospital in this Cleveland suburb June 28 with a
blood clot on the right lung.
   Presser, who became president of the nation's largest union in
1983 after his predecessor was convicted of fraud and bribery,
faced federal charges of racketeering and embezzlement. His trial,
however, was postponed indefinitely after he was diagnosed as
having brain cancer.
   ``Mr. Presser's condition had deteriorated significantly over
the last few hours and his cancer and previous cardiac condition
contributed to his death,'' Dr. Robert W. Reynolds, head of
Lakewood's cardiac care unit, said in a staement. Presser had
undergone open-heart surgery in 1985.
   He had relinquished his powers as president of the 1.6
million-member union for four months beginning May 4, and underwent
surgery for brain cancer May 17 at a clinic in Arizona.
   The following month, Presser entered Lakewood Hospital the same
day as federal prosecutors in New York filed a massive civil suit
seeking to take control of the union and break alleged Mafia
domination. Presser was one of the defendants in the suit.
   In a lengthy report issued in 1986, the White House Commission
on Organized Crime concluded that Presser would not have become
Teamsters president without the help of Anthony ``Fat Tony''
Salerno, head of the New York-based Genovese crime family.
   Presser always denied ties with the mob, and in May, Salerno was
acquitted on charges of rigging the elections of Presser and his
predecessor.
   Rex Hardesty, spokesman for the AFL-CIO, said when notified of
Presser's death that the union had no immediate comment. The
Teamsters union rejoined the labor federation last year, three
decades after it was expelled because of the corruption charges.
   Acting Teamsters president is Weldon L. Mathis, the union's
secretary-treasurer.
   Born Aug. 6, 1926, Presser was the son of William Faye ``Big
Bill'' Presser, a union organizer who eventually became president
of the Ohio Conference of Teamsters and part of the entourage of
union president Jimmy Hoffa.
   Presser left school after the eighth grade, went to work
delivering juke boxes and pinball machines and joined the Navy at
age 17.
   His first union work was on the staff of Local 10 of the Hotel
and Restaurant Employees Union in Cleveland, and he was elected
president of the local in 1948. Later he went to work for his
father as a Teamsters organizers.
   In 1966, Presser formed Teamsters Local 507 in Cleveland,
organizing paint company workers and other non-trucking laborers,
as well as some truckers, into a 6,000-member local, the biggest
Teamsters unit in Cleveland.
   Presser became vice president of the Ohio Conference of
Teamsters in the 1970s, and worked to improve the organization's
image through charitable activities and political work.
   In 1976, Presser was elected to succeed his father as an
international vice president. During the 1980 presidential
election, Presser used his influence to gain a union endorsement
for Ronald Reagan, and was rewarded by being named labor cochairman
for Reagan's inaugural.
   He became president of the union in April 1983 when the
executive committee named him to succeed Roy Williams, who had been
convicted of conspiring to bribe a U.S. senator.
   Two of Presser's three other predecessors also were convicted on
labor-corruption charges.
   Dave Beck served 2{ years in prison for filing a false Teamsters
tax return and for grand larceny, and the next president, Hoffa,
went to prison for jury tampering and fraud. After his release from
prison, Hoffa disappeared in 1975 and is presumed to have been
murdered.
   Presser began his regime on a high note, ordering a strong
public-relations campaign to counteract the effects of government
investigations. Appearing before a Senate subcommittee in 1983,
Presser asked ``for a chance to move this union in a progressive
direction'' and that he be judged on his actions.
   He was plagued, however, by allegations of ties to organized
crime and accusations by union dissidents that he was too quick to
grant contract concessions.
   In May 1986, Presser was charged with embezzlement and
racketeering on allegations that he took $700,000 from his
Cleveland local's office and paid it to ``ghost'' employees who
performed no work.
   Presser's attorney, John Climaco, claimed that Presser was an
FBI informant who took part in the payroll-padding scheme to assist
the government's investigation of embezzlement and labor
racketeering.
   Two other officials in the Cleveland local, president Harold
Friedman and recording secretary Anthony Hughes, also were indicted
on payroll-padding charges.
   U.S. Attorney Patrick M. McLaughlin in Cleveland said the trials
of the other two are still scheduled to begin in U.S. District
Court on Oct. 12.
   ``I don't know that it would be appropriate at this point for me
to comment on how this death will affect the prosecution of the
other defendants,'' McLaughlin said Saturday.
   Presser remained secretary-treasurer of Local 507 while
Teamsters president, drawing a reported $237,000 from the local and
an estimated $600,000 a year from the international union.
   His last major public appearance was in October 1987, when
Presser spoke to the AFL-CIO biennial convention. At that meeting,
the Teamsters were welcomed back into the union umbrella group
after 30 years of exile.
   ``I take pride, and I am very pleased and proud, that I and my
entire organization as well as my entire executive board are here
in attendence at this convention for reaffiliation,'' Presser told
the 700 delegates meeting at Miami Beach, Fla.

<TEXT>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) _ A decorated veteran of the city police
force was charged Saturday with raping a woman who had called for
police help.
   Charles Warwick, 29, was arraigned before a district justice in
nearby Hanover Township on charges of rape, indecent assault and
official oppression. He was released after posting $25,000 bail.
   Warwick, who was decorated in 1987 and was one of two officers
attached to the city's K-9 dog unit, was indefinitely suspended
from his duties Friday, said police Chief Joseph Coyne.
   In an affidavit filed with the district justice, a 36-year-old
woman said she called for police Wednesday night because her drunk
boyfriend was threatening her and a friend.
   Another officer took the boyfriend into custody, while Warwick
stayed behind saying he would comfort the woman, according to the
affidavit. The woman claimed that Warwick, who lives down the
street from her, raped her later that night.

   As Reagan was releasing his statement, Adm. William Crowe,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a news conference that
the Airbus had not responded to three warnings by the Vincennes on
a civilian distress network and four warnings on a military
network, and that the plane was descending toward the Vincennes and
accelerating, like an attacking aircraft.
   ``It is logical to conclude that while he is firing and they
(the gunboats) are approaching him and an aircraft lifts off from
Iran, goes toward him, steady course, high speed, decreasing
altitude, will not vary, will not contact him _ it's a more logical
conclusion that he may very well be in jeopardy,'' Crowe said.
   The captain and others in the Vincennes command center had only
four minutes to make a decision, Crowe said.
   But the version that emerged from the Pentagon in those first
hours soon began to change:
   _Crowe said Sunday the aircraft was four or five miles outside
the civilian air corridor. But by week's end the Pentagon
acknowledged that, as the Iranians insisted, Flight 655 may have
been on its prescribed path.
   _Crowe's assertion that the jetliner was descending came into
question when it was disclosed that another Navy ship, the USS John
H. Sides, reported that the A300 was either holding steady or
ascending. The Iranians insisted the plane was climbing.
   Although Crowe reported numerous radio warnings by the
Vincennes, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, Mohammad
Ja-Afar Mahallati, asserted there was no warning.
   The Pentagon also said the ``target'' _ Flight 655 _ was sending
radio signals on two channels, one a military channel ``identified
with the F-14s.'' A Navy spokesman dismissed speculation that the
military signal emanated from a second, military aircraft.
   Iranian air force chief Satari, who was trained in the United
States, told reporters in Tehran on Thursday that the A300 pilot
was in contact with the control tower at Bandar Abbas for 21
minutes, speaking in English, and he believed U.S. systems could
have picked up the conversation.
   Rezaian was an experienced pilot who learned his job the
American way, at a Boeing flight school in Texas 15 years ago. His
5-year-old daughter was born in Oklahoma, where his sister-in-law
and her husband live.
   ``I think he flew that route many times and just like me and you
going from our homes to work and come back, we know our way. I
think it's the same way for him,'' said Kamran Sadeghi, his
brother-in-law.
   However the pilot performed, said Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard,
the Iranians started the shooting Sunday and had a responsibility
to ``ensure the safety of their civilian aircraft by not sending
them into harm's way.''
   Satari called the shooting ``intentional and unprovoked.'' He
said the U.S. military ``accepted on purpose'' the risk of
attacking civilian planes because it could not control its
sophisticated systems.
   Technology and tactics mattered little to the crowds in Tehran.
At mass funerals for Flight 655's victims, ceremonies that erupted
into anti-American rallies, crowds spilled around the coffins,
shouting ``Death to Reagan!'' ``Revenge! Revenge!'' and,
inevitably, ``Death to America!''

<HEAD>Leaders Say Arms Sale To Saudis Threatens Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Assoiated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli leaders Sunday said Britain's
multibillion-dollar weapons deal with Saudi Arabia threatens
Israel's security and is a dangerous escalation of the arms race in
the Middle East.
   Army generals said the deal will enable the Saudis to launch a
pre-emptive strike against the Jewish state.
   Britain announced Friday it signed a $17 billion arms deal with
Saudi Arabia, supplanting the United States as the major arms
supplier to the oil-rich kingdom. The sale includes fighter planes
and helicopters.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's aide, Yossi Ben-Aharon, said the
sale will allow Saudi Arabia to ``hit us in the soft underbelly
from the south, using the long arm it is now acquiring.''
   ``The British government is saying it has improved relations
with Israel, but we are not seeing it in any way on the ground.
This staggering sale of arms points in a different direction
altogether,'' Ben-Aharon told Israel radio.
   A statement published by the Foreign Ministry said the supply of
weapons ``of an offensive nature to countries that are in a state
of war with Israel does not contribute to stablity in the region.''
   British officials said the deal included the sale of 50 to 60
Hawk jet training aircraft, six mine sweepers for use in the
Persian Gulf, 90 helicopters, about 50 Tornado fighter planes, and
weapons systems about which they did not elaborate.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the deal was part of ``an
escalation of the arms race by most of the Arab countries.'' He
added that it was an offshoot of the nearly 8-year-old Iran-Iraq
war, ``which gave a real push to the arms race in this region.''
   Rabin, speaking to 100 American rabbis, said Israel was also
concerned about long-range surface-to-surface missiles supplied
recently to Syria, as well as nerve gas and other chemical weapons
he said were in the arsenals of three or four Arab countries. He
did not name the countries.
   ``If our deterrents will prove insufficient,'' the defense
minister said Israel would make every effort to confront such
threats.
   Maj. Gen. Avigdor Ben Gal, a commander of Israel's forces in the
1982 Lebanon invasion, said the new Saudi weapons would make the
kingdom capable of launching ``a pre-emptive aerial attack against
Israel in case of war.''
   Other Israeli officials charged Britain with conducting an
imbalanced policy in the Middle East by selling weapons to Saudi
Arabia, while refusing to sell arms to Israel.

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A key issue at the 13th congress of the
governing Natonalist Party is how to shift political power from the
Old Guard conservatives to a new breed of progressive young leader.
   If that sounds familiar, it is because the party's archrival,
the Communist Party of mainland China, grappled with exactly the
same question at its own 13th congress in October.
   The Communists in China last year eased out of power most of the
aging leaders who fought alongside Mao Tse-tung to defeat the
Nationalists in a civil war that ended in 1949.
   Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan with about 2
million followers to set up a government in exile, and many of
those former mainlanders remain at the center of power on this
island of nearly 20 million.
   Many Old Guard Nationalist leaders have announced plans to step
down at the congress, but the final lineup remains unclear and is
the subject of intense speculation on Taiwan.
   Ironically, new blood is needed in both China and Taiwan to
follow through with sweeping reforms made by aging leaders from an
earlier generation.
   In China, pragamatist Deng Xiaoping boldly decided that opening
up to the outside world and introducing market-oriented economic
reforms was needed to rebuild his country after the ruinous 1966-76
Cultural Revolution.
   For his policy to succeed, however, Deng needed to replace his
conservative contemporaries with a younger generation that was more
enthusiastic about improving the economy than about Marxist
ideology.
   He triumphantly engineered the changing of the guard at the
October meeting, taking with him into retirement a host of
conservatives who served on the Central Committee and Politburo.
   Since the meeting, Chinese Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang
has continued to seek rapid change of the economic system and now
is concentrating on market-oriented price reform, a controversial
move that has fueled inflation.
   In Taiwan, the economy had been robust, but the political system
needed an overhaul to avoid serious confrontation with an
increasingly restive population.
   Ailing President Chiang Ching-kuo, the son of Chiang Kai-shek,
decided to start loosening his party's authoritarian which, for
nearly 40 years, tolerated little dissent.
   Before he died of heart failure in January, Chiang lifted 38
years of martial law, allowed formation of opposition parties,
scrapped a ban on new newspapers and eased restrictions on travel
to China to allow family reunions.
   He also promised to change Taiwan's parliamentary system, which
ensures a majority of seats are held by aging Nationalists who
arrived from mainland China with Chiang Kai-shek in 1949.
   Chiang's successor, President Lee Teng-hui, has vowed repeatedly
to continue the political liberalization program.
   On Sunday, he proposed that half the Nationalist Party's Central
Committee step down to make room for younger members and more
native Taiwanese.
   Lee also wants to reform the state-dominated financial system
and tackle other thorny problems that have largely been neglected,
such as pollution and social security.
   Lee undoubtedly wants like-minded Nationalist members to replace
the conservatives who still dominate the top levels of party and
government.
   Lee's task is not as easy as Deng's, however. He is still
forming a power base and Chiang is not around to use his
unquestioned leadership to convince aging comrades the time for
change has arrived.
   Local media reported in June that as many as half of the
policy-making Central Standing Committee planned to step down, but
in past days some newspapers predicted the turnover would not be
that great.
   Premier Yu Kuo-hwa, 74, widely viewed as the leader of the
conservative faction, was under pressure from younger party members
to step down.
   Still, there seemed to be little doubt that many of the
septuagenarians and octogenarians holding top party posts would
retire and the Cabinet overhauled. The congress concludes on
Thursday.
   Lee's task will be to make sure enough new blood flows through
the party and government to proceed with the liberalization
policies initiated by Chiang at a pace brisk enough to keep the
Taiwanese people satisfied.

<HEAD>Democrats Hope Hollywood-Style Convention Coverage Wins Over
Viewers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They may have been not ready for prime time in
1984, but this year the Democrats hope to package their convention
as a fast-paced, dramatic program that will prove irresistible to
TV networks and viewers.
   ``It takes a special kind of viewer to sit through hours and
hours of C-SPAN,'' said party spokesman Mike McCurry, referring to
the cable public affairs network that will be broadcasting
gavel-to-gavel coverage of next week's convention.
   With the three television networks scheduling only two to three
hours of convention coverage each evening, organizers are thinking
more along the lines of the people who watch ``Miami Vice.''
   ``We're trying to capture the mood and the spirit of the party
in a fairly dramatic and appealing way, short of `Entertainment
Tonight,''' McCurry said.
   Planners are weighing details ranging from who will sing ``The
Star Spangled Banner'' each night to how to fit the Boston Pops
into the convention program. Michael Dukakis, the nominee-to-be,
asked that the orchestra be included; his father-in-law is an
associate conductor.
   Videotaped visual aids, stirring music, futuristic decor _ all
are being coordinated by a Hollywood company determined to produce
a convention that leavens speeches with entertainment and elicits
an emotional reaction from viewers.
   Given the networks' short shrift and the average viewer's
attention span, most speeches are being limited to two to 10
minutes. ``It's certainly less time than most senators and members
of Congress are used to being asked to speak for,'' McCurry said.
   Whether the politicians can or will play by the rules is
unforseeable, but organizers are planning a few practical ways to
keep things moving. Among the precautionary measures: a cadre of
speechwriters available to trim upcoming speeches if the program
falls behind schedule.
   The objective is to avoid the type of snafu that forced Dukakis
out of prime time in 1984, the first year the three networks passed
up gavel-to-gavel coverage in favor of an abbreviated approach.
   Dukakis, as head of the platform committee, was tapped to
deliver the issues document to the convention. Between speech
overruns, general disorganization and a commitment to put Jesse
Jackson in prime time, the Massachusetts governor ended up on the
air just as prime time ended at 11 p.m. Eastern time.
   Speech-cutters, TelePrompter experts and other coaches will be
located this year in rooms beneath the huge podium, a complex
McCurry described as ``where we make sausage.'' Speakers will be
able to go over their remarks, receive help in honing them and get
coaching if they need it.
   Critical to the message communicated by Dukakis and the
Democrats are the 13,500 news people expected to attend the
convention _ nearly three times the number of delegates who will be
there.
   ``We marry each other for this one week of wildness,'' McCurry
said of the party and the press. ``But it's a marriage of
convenience only.''
   Typical of the temporary intimacy is a joint venture by the
Democratic National Committee and the Presidential Campaign Hotline.
   The hotline, a daily media operation during the primary season,
plans an hourly update of schedules, hot tips, news accounts and
messages from the Dukakis and Bush campaigns available to
subscribers with computer modems.
   The hotline boasts a wide network of sources among delegates and
media organizations, as well as official campaign and party
organizations. ``Information is power at the convention,'' says Bob
Balkin, a hotline editor.
   The party agrees. That's why, along with their hotline tips,
subscribers will get the DNC's ``Party Line,'' a compendium of
schedule changes, speech texts, press releases and other
propaganda, as McCurry calls it.
   ``A convention is a crazy merry-go-round ... and it's driven by
the flow of news and events and rumors,'' the spokesman said.
``We'd rather be on the merry-go-round than standing around
watching it.''

<HEAD>Study Suggests Partial Privatization Of Social Security</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.
recommends a partial privatization of Social Security to avoid the
temptation of squandering the huge surpluses now piling up in the
system's trust funds.
   It says such a move would give the United States a chance to
dramatically increase its savings rate.
   But the study warns that the nation must ``strenuously resist''
the temptation to splurge and spend the Social Security surpluses
on Medicare or other programs.
   The study suggests that workers be allowed to divert 2
percentage points of their payroll tax into individual investment
accounts starting in 1990, when the tax climbs from 7.51 to 7.65
percentage points.
   ``For the typical taxpayer the diversion would amount to about
$500 to $1,000 per year,'' the study suggested, with the money
invested in accounts ``similar to today's Individual Retirement
Accounts, but subject to tougher tests of investment suitability
and tighter restraints on early withdrawals.''
   In exchange for the opportunity to build up private accounts,
the workers would eventually get reduced Social Security benefits.
   But this approach would free up money for private investment and
``ensure that most of the Social Security reserve is productively
invested,'' said the study in the July issue of Morgan's World
Financial Markets report. The report is published by Morgan
Guaranty Trust Co., a subsidiary of J.P. Morgan & Co. Inc.
   After encountering severe deficits in the late 1970s and early
1980s, Social Security's trust funds are now growing at a rapid
pace _ $20 billion last year alone and an estimated $500 billion a
year by 2015. The system is expected to have $12 trillion in
reserve in 2030 _ or about $2.5 trillion in today's dollars.
   By law, all of that money must be invested in Treasury
securities. Each year's Social Security surplus reduces the overall
federal debt by an identical amount.
   The Morgan study said it is possible that by 2005, Social
Security's trust funds ``could absorb all outstanding federal
debt.''
   The Social Security system expects its outgo to start exceeding
its income around 2020, and would cash in its federal securities
over the next three decades to help pay for the retirement of the
post-World War II baby boomers.
   The Morgan report said, ``the temptation to squander the looming
Social Security surpluses for immediate gain must be strenuously
resisted.''
   ``With careful husbandry, (they) present an unequaled
opportunity to boost the U.S. net savings and investment rates,
perhaps to as much as 8 percent of GNP,'' it said.
   The national savings rate has averaged 3 percent in the 1980s,
and dipped to just 1.9 percent in 1987.
   ``Wisely handled, Social Security surpluses could make a
dramatic difference for U.S. economic prospects. Higher domestic
savings not only would help eliminate the trade ... deficits, and
the associated dependence on foreign saving, but also would help
build up the nation's productive capital stock,'' it said. ``That
is the only convincing assurance of retirement security.''
   It likened Social Security ``to a benevolent `Ponzi' (pyramid)
scheme. Each new generation pays for the older generation's
retirement, relying on subsequent generations to do the same.''
   ``Any pyramid scheme will unravel if the pool of contributors
fails to expand sufficiently fast. This could well be the case with
Social Security,'' it said.
   But it said switching entirely to a private savings system for
retirement is unfeasible. ``The best solution could be to privatize
just the surplus portion of Social Security revenues,'' it said.
   When Social Security started running annual deficits in 2020,
workers would no longer be able to divert part of their payroll
taxes to private accounts.
   The study also suggests the possibility of restraining costs by
reducing future benefits for middle- and upper-income retirees, and
by raising the retirement age to 68 or 69 in the next century. It
is already scheduled to climb to 67 from 65 by the year 2027.

   The Detroit newspaper merger, the criminal
investigation of former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and
the Pentagon bribery probe are at the top of the Justice Department
agenda as Attorney General Edwin Meese III prepares to leave office.
   Meese, who is not participating in the Pentagon investigation
because his lawyers are representing clients involved in it, will
be gone from the Justice Department by the time federal prosecutors
are ready to seek indictments in the Pentagon investigation later
this year.
   But Meese has said through a spokesman he hopes to wrap up a
number of other loose ends before leaving in late July or early
August, including the question of whether the Detroit Free Press
and the Detroit News should be allowed to merge their advertising,
circulation and production operations under the Newspaper
Preservation Act.
   Meese also may still be in office when the department decides
whether to seek an indictment of Marcos, who has been investigated
by a number of federal grand juries since he was ousted in February
1986. Marcos lives in exile in Honolulu.
   Federal prosecutors are asking for approval from Justice
Department superiors to seek grand jury indictments against Marcos,
and his wife, Imelda, on fraud and other charges, law enforcement
officials have said.
   The proposed charges include allegations of a conspiracy to
steal from the Philippine government over two decades and fraud in
the way money was concealed in the United States behind false
ownerships, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Among the other issues a successor will be coping with after
Meese leaves:
   _The Justice Department's drug testing program, which would
subject 1,800 employees in sensitive jobs to mandatory, random
urinalysis. The employees, many of them lawyers, are suing the
department, saying the program that could begin shortly violates
their constitutional right to due process and to protection against
unreasonable searches and seizures.
   _Trying to push through Congress a legislative package in the
war on drugs. The administration is promoting legislation
authorizing the death penalty for defendants who are convicted of
murder while engaged in a continuing drug enterprise.
   Justice Department officials also are anxious to have the Senate
confirm Deputy Attorney General Harold Christensen, Associate
Attorney General Francis Keating and criminal division chief Edward
Dennis. All are currently serving in acting capacities, with
confirmation hearings scheduled for the end of the month.
   Keating has been on the job about two months, while Christensen
and Dennis arrived early in June.
   Christensen and Dennis are replacing former Deputy Attorney
General Arnold Burns and Assistant Attorney General William Weld,
whose protest resignations March 29 over Meese's continued tenure
brought accusations of a serious leadership gap in the department.

   Democrat William Proxmire used to win
re-election to the U.S. Senate while spending pocket change _
$145.10 in 1982 _ but now that he's retiring big spending has
emerged as a major issue in the campaign to replace him.
   The money issue ballooned after multimillionaire retailing heir
Herbert Kohl entered the Democratic primary, which takes place
Sept. 13.
   And while his opponents say Kohl's spending will insult
Wisconsin voters and go against tradition, polls suggest the
opposite.
   Kohl's primary election rivals, including former Gov. Anthony S.
Earl and former National Football League players union
representative Edward R. Garvey, have denounced his heavy
investment in television ads, claiming he is attempting to buy the
Senate seat.
   ``To suggest the people of Wisconsin can be bought is not
something that I have ever considered,'' said Kohl, 53, owner of
the Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Association.
   Proxmire, 72, won his seat in a 1957 special election to replace
right-wing Republican Sen. Joseph McCarthy, who had died. Proxmire
became known as a sharp critic of government waste and won
re-election with frugal spending.
   In 1982, Proxmire reported he spent $145.10, down from $177.75
in 1976.
   Kohl has put nearly $500,000 into television ads since his June
1 entry, according to a survey of TV stations in five cities.
   One of Kohl's opponents, Rep. Jim Moody, D-Wis., bowed out last
week, saying he couldn't compete and would instead seek re-election
to the House.
   ``Money is now determining this Senate race,'' Moody said.
   Kohl, who was chairman of the state Democratic Party in 1977,
said he must invest in television ads to compete effectively
because it is his first bid for public office, unlike his seasoned
opponents, Earl, Garvey and Secretary of State Douglas La Follette.
   Kohl's campaign has provoked complaints from Garvey, Earl and La
Follette, who contend he should campaign in the ``Wisconsin
tradition'' and join his rivals in debates on the issues. Earl was
expected to start running radio ads stressing that argument.
   ``I think what is happening is really insulting to the voters of
Wisconsin,'' said Garvey, who led the NFL players out on strike
1982. ``I'm trying to run a campaign Wisconsin-style.''
   But after Kohl's commercials started, a poll conducted in late
June by The Milwaukee Journal found him with 28 percent support,
just behind Earl's 31 percent and well ahead of Moody and Garvey,
each of whom had 12 percent. La Follette was last with 8 percent.
The poll's margin of error was 6 percent.
   Kohl was only at 8 percent in an earlier poll, before his TV ads
started.
   ``In my 30 years in the Senate, I have never seen anything like
it,'' Proxmire said of Kohl's sudden rise. ``Money is important, of
course, and Herb Kohl's got it to spend.''
   Garvey, who has also served as the state's deputy attorney
general, said his campaign has raised about $350,000 and he has
spent all but about $80,000.
   Earl, who was governor in 1983-87, recently asked Kohl and
others to agree to a campaign spending limit of about $1 million, a
proposal Kohl rejected.
   The Democratic primary winner will likely square off against
either state Sen. Susan Engeleiter or Stephen B. King, a
businessman and former chairman of the Republican Party of
Wisconsin.
   Engeleiter, 36, first elected to the Legislature at age 22 in
1974, has served as Senate minority leader since 1985.
   King, a former FBI agent, was hired by the committee to re-elect
President Richard Nixon in 1972 to handle security. He also served
as a personal bodyguard for former Attorney General John Mitchell
and his wife, Martha.
   Mrs. Mitchell wrote a book in which she accused King of tying
her down and drugging her in order to keep her quiet when the
Watergate scandal surfaced. Mitchell said in March that King had
been given a ``bum rap'' and said his wife, who died in 1976, had a
``severe drinking problem.''

<HEAD>Magazine, Citing FBI Memo, Says Bush May Have Worked for CIA in
1960s</HEAD>

   Vice President George Bush may have worked for
the Central Intelligence Agency in 1963, more than a decade before
becoming its director, according to a magazine article that cites a
recently discovered FBI memorandum.
   Bush denied the report through a spokesman.
   The Nation magazine, in its current issue, quotes a Federal
Bureau of Investigation memo of November 29, 1963, from
then-director J. Edgar Hoover to the State Department on the
subject of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
   In the memo, according to the magazine, Hoover stated that the
bureau had briefed ``Mr. George Bush of the Central Intelligence
Agency'' on the reaction of Cuban exiles in Miami to the
assassination.
   The magazine article, written by Joseph McBride, also quoted an
unidentified source ``with close connections to the intelligence
community'' as saying Bush ``started working for the agency in 1960
or 1961, using his oil business as a cover for clandestine
activities.''
   Stephen Hart, a spokesman for the vice president, said,
``There's nothing to this.''
   Hart said he had talked to Bush about the story, and that Bush
denied any involvement with the CIA prior to being named director
by President Ford in 1975.
   ``He was an oilman in the early 1960s and in 1963 he was running
for the Senate,'' Hart said. Asked if perhaps another ``George
Bush'' might have been the one who worked for the CIA, Hart said,
``I don't want to speculate, but the story is not correct.''
   Bill Devine, a CIA spokesman, declined to comment on the
possibility that Bush _ or someone else with that name _ worked for
the agency in the 1960s.
   ``It's our standard policy on allegations that people have
worked for the CIA or that sort of thing. We neither confirm nor
deny,'' Devine said. ``We certainly confirm that he worked for the
CIA when he was director.''
   The magazine said Hoover's memo was recently discovered among
98,755 pages of FBI documents released in 1977 and 1978 in
connection with Freedom of Information Act suits.
   Hoover's memo relays concerns of an FBI informant in Miami that
anti-Castro groups might capitalize on the confusion following the
assassination to undertake an unauthorized raid against Cuba, the
magazine said.
   ``The substance of the foregoing information was orally
furnished to Mr. George Bush of the Central Intelligence Agency,''
Hoover is quoted as saying.
   At the time, Bush was running the Houston-based Zapata Off-Shore
Co., which the magazine said gave Bush an opportunity to do
extensive overseas travel, including trips throughout the
Caribbean. In 1964, Bush ran unsuccessfully for the Senate against
the Democratic incumbent, Ralph Yarborough.
   The Nation article quotes the unidentified intelligence source
as saying of the vice president: ``I know he was involved in the
Caribbean. I know he was involved in the suppression of things
after the Kennedy assassination.''
   In his 1987 autobiography, ``Looking Forward,'' Bush calls his
appointment to head the CIA ``a real shocker'' in light of his
background as a ``non-professional outsider _ and a politician to
boot.''
   However, Bush also notes in his autobiography that ``I'd come to
the CIA with some general knowledge of how it operated.''
   The Nation article cites this line from Bush's book, and another
one in which Bush refers to his many ``overseas contacts as a
businessman'' as possible veiled references to previous CIA
experience.

<HEAD>Soviet Envoy Says Arms Talks Progressing, But `Star Wars' A
Problem</HEAD>

   Superpower talks on a treaty to cut U.S. and
Soviet long-range nuclear arsenals have come a long way, but
President Reagan's ``Star Wars'' program is one of two major
obstacles remaining, Moscow's chief arms negotiator said Sunday.
   ``We do not want to lose momentum,'' said envoy Alexei Obukhov,
who arrived here for the arms talks, which are to resume Tuesday
after a five-week recess for the Moscow summit.
   The United States and the Soviet Union have agreed to work
toward a treaty that would reduce by 50 percent their combined
long-range missiles over seven years, with each side limited to
6,000 nuclear warheads.
   ``A long way has already been covered toward the treaty on 50
percent reductions in strategic offensive arms,'' Obukhov said.
``The outstanding questions can and should be resolved.''
   The Soviet negotiator called for a ``constructive approach'' by
Washington.
   Obukhov said the two major obstacles to the new arms agreement
are the long-standing disagreement over Reagan's Strategic Defense
Initiative, known as ``Star Wars,'' and the issue of limiting
sea-launched cruise missiles.
   The Soviets link a new treaty to curbs on SDI, a space-based
missile defense system. The Soviets say Reagan's program would
violate the 1972 U.S.-Soviet Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which
limits each side to a missile defense at one site.
   They want the United States to limit the scope of SDI, but
Reagan repeated at the beginning of the Moscow summit that his
program is not on the bargaining table.
   Obukhov reiterated a call for both sides to strictly observe the
ABM treaty.
   Obukhov called sea-launched cruise missiles a ``dangerous type
of strategic offensive arms'' and said ``reliable'' limits are a
prerequisite for an effective treaty. He urged that anti-cheating
measures include inspections aboard warships, a proposal the United
States has rejected.
   Obukhov said progress at the Geneva negotiations now depends
mainly on resolving these points, which Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev failed to do at their May 29-June 2 meeting.
   However, the leaders agreed at the summit that both sides should
consider all existing long-range air-launched cruise missiles as
nuclear weapons and distinguish between bombers that carry them and
those that do not.
   The two sides also agreed to restrict mobile missiles to
designated territories to simplify counting. But the size of the
areas was not set.
   Both types of weapons are to be included in the new treaty.
   Noting the agreements at the summit, Obukhov said the resumed
Geneva talks have ``a special dimension.''
   Reagan and Gorbachev said after the Moscow meeting that a treaty
on reducing long-range nuclear missiles is possible before Reagan
leaves office in January, but no breakthrough appears imminent.
   Obukhov said the length of the new round of talks in Geneva,
which began in March 1985, has not been set.
   He will meet chief U.S. delegate Max Kampelman on Monday to
discuss procedural details. Kampelman arrived here Saturday but did
not speak to reporters.
   At a December summit meeting in Washington, Reagan and Gorbachev
signed a treaty eliminating intermediate-range missiles and both
countries ratified the pact shortly before the Moscow summit.

<HEAD>Soviet Radio Says Factories, Transport Working Again in Armenia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transport and factory workers went back to work in
Armenia's capital Sunday, state-run Radio Moscow reported, and a
general strike sparked by a bitter territorial dispute appeared to
be winding down.
   In Moscow, Armenian activists gathered to protest the crushing
of an Armenian demonstration last week.
   Armenian activists called for the work stoppage July 4 over
apparent dissatisfaction that a recent national Communist Party
conference did not resolve the status of the Nagorno-Karabakh
region of Azerbaijan.
   The government of the mainly Armenian district has voted to pull
out of Azerbaijan and join Armenia. Armenia has backed the demand,
but Azerbaijan has rejected it, and both Armenia and
Nagorno-Karabakh have asked Moscow to intervene.
   In a Sunday report from Armenia's capital of Yerevan, Radio
Moscow said, ``There were no violations of public order and public
transport, including railways, functioned normally. More than 60
plants worked.''
   An Armenian broadcast journalist contacted by telephone from
Moscow said Friday about half of Yerevan's public transport had
resumed work that day, and the Sotsialisticheskaya Industriya
newspaper said that food-proceesing plants had reopened for
business.
   The paper said each day of the strike caused a loss of $16
million in industrial production.
   Radio Moscow gave no news of the status of a similar strike in
Nagorno-Karabakh, and it was not immediately possible to contact
the Caucasus Mountain region by telephone.
   The labor daily Trud has said that the strike in Stepanakert,
Nagorno-Karabakh's capital, has already cost $64 million in lost
industrial production. The newspaper said Stepanakert enterprises
failed to deliver $32 million worth of supplies.
   About 300 Armenians held a rally in Moscow on Sunday to protest
the crushing of a protest at Yerevan's Zvartnots Airport last week.
Demonstrators overran the airport on July 4-5, and Armenian
officials said one was killed by a plastic bullet fired by Soviet
troops who were sent to restore order.
   Armenian activists have claimed that as many as five people were
killed when soldiers fired on the protesters.
   Soviet officials denied the allegations.
   Witnesses to the Sunday rally, which was held outside Moscow's
Armenian church, said Armenians circulated photographs they said
showed the funerals of two of the people who died in the airport
protest, including one who reportedly had a heart attack while
arguing with soldiers.
   In February, ethnic violence between Armenians and Azerbaijanis
left at least 32 people dead in the city of Sumgait in Azerbaijan.

   When he sets off on foot for Belgium from
Warsaw on Monday, a British peace activist and former Roman
Catholic priest will wear a sweatshirt with the phrase ``one
world'' written in five languages.
   That is the message Bruce Kent plans to spread to citizens of
Eastern and Western Europe during a 45-day hike through Poland,
East Germany, West Germany and Belgium.
   ``My main purpose is to get across the message that Europe could
live without the two military blocs and without confrontation,''
said Kent, 59.
   But the arrival of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Warsaw on
Monday has set Kent scouting for alternative departure points in
case police block Warsaw roads for security purposes.
   The lawyer says he chose to start his march for a conflict-free
Europe in Warsaw and end it in the Belgian capital of Brussels for
symbolic reasons.
   Warsaw was the site of the signing of the Warsaw Pact treaty in
1955 and Brussels is the administrative center for the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   The United Nations' Association, the War on Want and the British
Campaign for Nuclear Disarmanent have sponsored the trip, Kent's
second long trek.
   He walked 500 miles from a nuclear submarine base in Scotland to
a nuclear bomb plant in Reading, England in 1987.
   That march raised $255,000 for peace causes. He has collected
$27,200 this time, enough to pay for the trip, which will cover
about 1,000 miles.
   This time, two translators and an assistant will accompany Kent.
He plans to walk six days a week and attend church services Sunday.
   Kent hopes to walk through the East German city of Dresden,
largely destroyed by British and U.S. bombs in 1945, and the West
German city of Nuremberg, where the allies tried Nazi war criminals
after World War II.
   On Sunday, the banned peace group Freedom and Peace announced
two of its members will join Kent for the departure with a banner
demanding the release of the 15 conscientious objectors the group
says are imprisoned for resisting the draft.
   Freedom and Peace has campaigned for alternate civilian service
for the military draft.

   Fifty skinheads smashed a street
vendor's booth and attacked riot police with debris and bottles at
a festival near Frankfurt, authorities said Sunday.
   Police said 40 of the youths were arrested and that one
policeman and two rowdies were injured.
   Authorities said the violence began after the youths were
refused entry into a festival tent in Hofheim late Saturday. The
small town is 12 miles west of Frankfurt.
   The youths responded by storming and destroying a Turkish street
vendor's stand and blocking an intersection, police said.
   ``The youths could only be arrested after the repeated use of
police truncheons,'' a Frankfurt police official said.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said officers
were attacked with bottles and other debris before they arrested
the youths.
   He said the youths were charged with assault, resisting arrest
and destruction of property.

   Emmanuel ``Mannie'' Manheim, a radio
and television writer for Groucho Marx, Frank Sinatra and Art
Linkletter, has died at age 90.
   Manheim died at Santa Monica Hospital on June 26, family and
friends said. The cause of death was not released and no funeral
services were scheduled.
   Manheim came to Hollywood in the mid-1930s from Syracuse, N.Y.,
for a brief vacation, but stayed at the behest of a friend,
composer Harold Arlen.
   Over the next 50 years, Manheim wrote for some of the most
popular radio and television shows, including ``You Bet Your
Life,''``People Are Funny,''``The Real McCoys,''``The Donna Reed
Show,'' and ``My Three Sons.''
   Manheim got his start by writing a radio sketch for Groucho and
Chico Marx for radio; Groucho Marx once credited Manheim with
helping him launch his television career on the strength of
Manheim's ``You Bet Your Life'' scripts.
   Manheim also wrote for Edgar Bergen, Rudy Vallee, Jackie
Gleason, Al Jolson, Bob Hope, Bing Crosby and Milton Berle.
   Manheim is survived by his wife, Martha, and his brother, Het.

   The worst drought since the Dust Bowl of the 1930s is drying up
rivers that normally churn cheap power at hydroelectric dams, and
some higher light bills already are in the mail.
   An Associated Press survey of electric utilities across the
United States turned up no forecasts of major shortages this
summer, but some Western power agencies, dependent on winter's snow
to fill their reservoirs, are worried about continuing drought.
   ``It's over the long term that you start to see impacts _ this
fall and next winter,'' said Steven Schweitzer, deputy area manager
for Western Power Administration at Billings, Mont.
   The American Public Power Association reports that only about
one-eighth of the 2.4 trillion kilowatt hours of electricity
consumed annually in the United States is generated by turbines at
hydroelectric dams. Most utilities can survive without
hydroelectric power _ but may have to pass higher costs of steam
plant generation to their customers.
   The 1 million customers of Alabama Power Co. will find an
increase of 88 cents per 1,000 kilowatt hours in their next bills.
This will push the bill for that amount of energy, considered the
monthly residential average, to $68.11.
   Alabama Power spokesman Chris Conway said the state based its
decision to approve the increase to ``a certain extent'' on the
drought, which has forced the utility to shut down its 14
hydroelectric plants.
   Idaho Power Co. normally produces half its electricity from
hydro plants on the Snake River, now severely low. When more
expensive coal-fired generators began taking up the slack, the
state utilities commission allowed the company to add a $9.6
million annual surcharge to the bills of its 260,000 customers.
   Elsewhere, low rivers could threaten some coal-fired or even
nuclear power plants for want of cooling water, several utility
officials said.
   And while utilities across the nation promise to meet demand,
many said there would be less surplus power to help other utilities
meet peak demands.
   The nation's largest hydroelectric system, Bonneville Power
Administration in the Pacific Northwest, has no immediate problems,
officials said. Streams that feed its 30 federally built reservoirs
depend on runoff from winter snow and are flowing at 70 percent
their normal rate.
   This is far from the driest on record, but Bob Reed, a spokesman
for the agency that serves parts of eight Western states, said
officials are looking at the fall and winter.
   ``Not all the reservoirs will refill this summer and that will
mean next year we will have to operate under more constrained
mode,'' he said.
   The Tennessee Valley Authority, the nation's largest supplier of
electricity, began as a hydroelectric agency but now counts on its
dams for only about 10 percent of the power it furnishes to seven
Southeastern states.
   Stream flow in the Tennessee River and its tributaries is only
20 percent of normal, cutting hydroelectric generation in half and
forcing TVA to spend $117 million extra to produce power.
   ``This additional cost results from replacing low-cost hydro
power with higher cost coal-fired generation and power purchases,''
said Jimmy L. Cross, TVA's vice president for business operations.
In any case, TVA has pledged not to increase rates for the next
three years.
   TVA's hookup with 15 other utilities through 40 tie lines should
make summer shortages the exception rather than the rule, said Hugh
Gardner, manager of TVA's power branch.
   Hayden Timmons, public relations director for Big Rivers
Electric Corp. in western Kentucky, was among those who worried
about a shortage of water and a possible shortage of surplus power.
   Big Rivers does not generate hydroelectric power, but needs
river water for its coal-fired steam plants. At three plants,
Timmons said, the Green and Ohio Rivers are so low that they are
within one to two feet of the water intakes. If the water drops
below the intake lines, the plants would have to close.
   Tal Wright, spokesman for Georgia Power Co. in Atlanta, said the
drought has cut hydroelectric production in half, but nuclear power
plants are producing about half the state's needs, with coal-fired
plants making up the rest.
   Beth Bosch, spokeswoman for the Illinois Commerce Commission,
said that if the drought continues, drying of cooling ponds at the
state's 13 nuclear power plants could be damaging. Commonwealth
Edison operates 12 plants and Illinois Power Co. has one.

   Farm Bloc strategists are pinning their hopes
for passage of a drought relief bill this summer on rapid action
combined with America's renowned soft spot for the family farmer.
   ``We are going to try desperately to get a consensus and avoid a
lot of bickering within the halls of Congress,'' North Dakota Gov.
George Sinner said as Farm Bloc leaders huddled last Thursday to
map strategy.
   Within a day, chairmen of both House and Senate Agriculture
committees declared that they would fashion a bill this week to
furnish relief for farmers whose crops have been scorched by
withering heat and lack of rainfall.
   Aides to Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy,
D-Vt., even refused to rule out the possibility that the bill might
be whisked through committee and onto the floor for final action,
all in one week.
   Gone is the wait-and-see course adoped by Leahy and House
Agriculture Chairman E. ``Kika'' de la Garza, D-Texas, in recent
weeks.
   Instead, lawmakers are clearing the decks for an election-year
disaster bill that could run into billions of dollars. No reliable
estimate of just how much it might cost has been made public.
   As things stand, the drought will reduce farm subsidy spending
by the government's Commodity Credit Corp. well below its budgeted
level of $17 billion. How much is unclear, but lawmakers are
talking about ``recycling'' the savings and distributing the money
to farmers as drought relief.
   The legislation could wind up with an array of additional costs,
however. For example, lawmakers are talking about dropping a
planned 50-cent cut in dairy price supports set for Jan. 1, an idea
favored by Leahy's home state dairymen well before drought set in.
   The proposal went nowhere in the past but now dairy forces say
that rising feed costs demand a higher support level.
   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng, chief advocate of the
wait-and-see approach, has reversed course and given lawmakers the
green light to start drafting legislation.
   Lawmakers give varying reasons for speeding up action. For one
thing, the drought has been getting worse. Rain has not come in
sufficient quantities to boost hopes in the Corn Belt, which has
about one week left before much of the already-parched crop passes
the point of no return.
   Leahy said farmers were worried and, therefore, ``we need to
send them hope.'' De la Garza noted ``the limited amount of time
remaining in this congressional session.''
   But de la Garza also acknowledged that the bill could actually
put cash in the hands of farmers before they would get it without
the drought and that some growers are currently marketing 1987
crops.
   Strategists said that thus far, talk of a big farm bill has not
galvanized urban complaints about big government payments. Such
criticism did materialize following approval of the subsidy-laden
1985 farm bill, and farm lawmakers have been gun shy about it ever
since.
   ``No one is even talking about general opposition developing on
the floor,'' Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said. He expressed
confidence that `'there still is a great reservoir of support among
urban voters for farmers.''
   A number of polls taken in the wake of the 1985 farm legislation
showed that urban voters were deeply sympathetic to the plight of
``family farmers'' and not for the most part resentful about
agricultural subsidies that reached a peak of $26 billion in 1986.
   Lawmakers made clear that they will attempt to tap into that
reservoir of good will in pushing ahead with their drought bill.
   But urban congressmen are not unanimous in their willingness to
go along with hefty farm spending. Strategists, who asked not to be
quoted by name, indicated at week's end that there has been talk of
moving swiftly before such persistent critics as Reps. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., and Joseph J. DioGuardi, R-N.Y., become overly
aroused.
   Even if it proves impossible to get the bill through both houses
this week, farm lawmakers are shooting for having the measure on
the president's desk before they flee Washington's August heat.
``We're going to get it done this summer,'' Leahy said. ``August is
summer, September isn't.''
   Such rapid action also could give the Farm Bloc a better chance
of outrunning any colleagues who might want to harness non-farm
drought plans to a bill providing benefits to farmers.
   Any amendment, for example, designed to force diversion of Great
Lakes water to the Mississippi, a plan under consideration for
years, could easily send drought relief legislation to drydock for
the rest of the year.
   Farm lawmakers also are plainly concerned that their coalition
has been cracking under the twin pressures of drought and
election-year politics. Following Lyng's now abandoned wait-and-see
approach, the two committee chairmen convened a task force to
monitor the drought and cautioned their followers not to jump the
gun by introducing bills.
   Almost immediately Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., and Rep.
Bob Traxler, D-Mich., proposed a plan to furnish aid to Michigan
apple growers and a wide array of other farmers. The two lawmakers,
neither an Agriculture Committee member, scoffed at any notion that
they might be jeopardizing drought relief by moving too quickly.
   Ten days ago, a senior Senate Agriculture Committee member, Sen.
John Melcher, D-Mont., introduced a sweeping drought bill and also
scoffed at the wait-and-see approach. ``Relief delayed is relief
minimized,'' Melcher said.

   Sanctuary supporters say the trial of a
Lutheran minister and a free-lance journalist could focus attention
on the issues surrounding people who flee to the United States from
war-torn Central America.
   But prosecutors contend the case isn't about sanctuary. They say
it's a case of selling babies in an adoption-for-profit scheme.
   The Rev. Glen Remer-Thamert, 44, and Demetria Martinez, 27, were
indicted last Dec. 10, accused of helping two pregnant Salvadoran
women enter the United States illegally in August 1986. Both women
gave birth in the United States, and one of the babies was put up
for adoption.
   The trial begins Wednesday before U.S. District Judge John
Conway.
   Remer-Thamert was indicted on nine counts of conspiracy,
transporting and harboring illegal aliens and mail fraud. Ms.
Martinez was charged with four counts of transporting and inducing
illegal aliens.
   Remer-Thamert's case has been embraced by the sanctuary movement
of clergy and lay people who have been aiding refugees from Central
America since the early 1980s.
   ``For us, it is not something that is against the law, to give
sanctuary to someone fleeing for his or her life,'' said Patricio
Guerrerortiz, a member of the New Mexico Sanctuary Defense
Committee, which was set up to help pay legal expenses.
   Remer-Thamert has said he is being prosecuted because of his
outspoken criticism of the Reagan administration's policies in
Central America.
   Ms. Martinez, a free-lance writer who covers religion for the
Albuquerque Journal and the National Catholic Reporter, has said
she acted solely as a journalist when she accompanied Remer-Thamert
and tried to take steps to ensure she would not even travel with
the women to Albuquerque.
   She also has said she never wrote a story about the women,
partly out of fear for their safety.
   ``I have researched a number of topics that pertain to religion,
including the sanctuary movement and the role of mainline
denominations relative to that movement,'' she said at the time of
her indictment.
   A federal court rule prevents attorneys from discussing the
merits of a case, but legal maneuvering over the past few months
gives some indication of the direction the trial will take.
   U.S. Attorney William Lutz, who will prosecute the case, said in
a court document filed in February that Remer-Thamert was selling
Salvadoran babies for adoption, not helping political refugees.
   ``As soon as the defendant got his hands on the babies, he meant
to transport the women back to El Salvador,'' the document said.
   The indictment accused Remer-Thamert of submitting false expense
documents to Rainbow House International, an adoption agency, and
of receiving $2,900.
   Remer-Thamert said after his indictment that he was reimbursed
for some costs of helping the women but received no fees.
   The women, Cecelia Elias-Alegria and Inez Campos-Anzora, remain
in the United States and are expected to be called as prosecution
witnesses.
   Sanctuary supporters were elated last month when Conway ruled
that a March 28, 1986, proclamation by former Gov. Toney Anaya
declaring New Mexico a sanctuary state could be used by
Remer-Thamert and Ms. Martinez in their defense.
   The proclamation was rescinded by Gov. Garrey Carruthers when he
took office in January 1987.
   Remer-Thamert said last week he was dismissed from his social
services job with the state after the indictment. Since then, he
said, he has been taking care of his two children, writing a book
and raising a garden.
   ``Having been indicted for the first time, I clearly understand
how vulnerable a situation it is to be indicted and how necessary
it is to have supportive friends and family,'' he said.
   A Salvadoran attorney, Luis Arturo Ventura-Rivas, was also named
in the indictment but he will not be on trial because he remains in
El Salvador.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The association between drug use and crime
rose sharply over a 12-year span ending in 1986, the government
reported Sunday.
   About 35 percent of the nation's state prison inmates in 1986
were under the influence of an illegal drug at the time they
committed the crime for which they were then incarcerated, the
Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics said. Twelve
years earlier, the proportion was about 25 percent, while in 1979,
it was 32 percent.
   The survey also found that many inmates began to use drugs only
after their criminal careers had already started.
   In the 1986 survey, half of the inmates who had ever used a
major drug such as heroin, cocaine, methadone, PCP or LSD did not
do so until after their first arrest. About 60 percent of those who
had ever used a major drug regularly did not do so until after
their first arrest.
   In addition, about one-seventh of the inmates, 13 percent, seem
to fit the pattern of drug addicts who committed crimes to support
their habits, said the bureau's director, Steven Schlesinger.
   This group was in prison for such crimes as robbery, burglary or
theft and they were among the 19 percent of the inmates who said
they were daily users of heroin, cocaine, methadone, PCP or LSD in
the month before they committed a crime.
   About 50 percent of those serving sentences for robbery,
burglary, theft or a drug offense were daily users of some illegal
drug.
   In addition, the 1986 survey of 13,700 inmates reported that
about 43 percent of them said they were daily users of some illegal
drug in the month before they committed the crime for which they
were imprisoned.
   Other findings:
   _The greater the use of major drugs by an offender, the more
prior convictions of all types the inmate reported. Less than 13
percent of those who had never used a major drug had half a dozen
or more earlier convictions, compared with nearly 30 percent of
daily users of major drugs.
   _White inmates and female inmates were somewhat more likely to
have been regular users of major drugs at some point in their lives.
   _About one-half of state inmates who had ever used drugs began
by the time they were 15 years old.

<TEXT>
   Two of 10 men charged in an alleged gang
rape at a cockfight go on trial Monday in this small southern Texas
town which has endured months of questions about the incident.
   A grand jury charged that during a night of gambling, drinking
and drugs, a 19-year-old woman was kidnapped and raped by as many
as 20 men while another dozen men and women either cheered or did
nothing to help her.
   But some residents in the town have said they believe the woman
knew the 10 men she named as her assailants and participated
willingly.
   The two who will stand trial Monday are Orlando Garza and
Corando Perez, both 23; they're charged with aggravated kidnapping
and sexual assault.
   ``I think everybody wants to put it behind them,'' said
Assistant District Attorney Rodolfo Gutierrez, the prosecutor.
   Neither Gutierrez nor the defense asked that the trial be moved
outside this close-knit town of 5,300, about 50 miles west of
Corpus Christi.
   Nine of the 10 defendants are related by blood or by marriage.
Two of the men lived next door to the victim.
   The woman said she was forced into a car with four men after she
declined a ride from them on March 26. She said she was driven
north of town to a tin shed where a cockfight was being held and
where she was repeatedly raped. Cockfights are illegal in the
United States.
   A month after the attack, a special Duval County grand jury
indicted 10 men on 12 counts of kidnapping and sexual assault.
   The woman, her husband, and her two children have since left
town.
   ``They have to get out of town,'' said Richard Yaeger, a family
friend. ``They'll never be able to come back here. These people
here are acting like (the victim and her family) are in the wrong.''

<HEAD>Four Charged With Taking 1,088 Sea Turtle Eggs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIVIERA BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State wildlife officers arrested four
people and confiscated more than 1,000 sea turtle eggs after
staking out a beach used for nesting by endangered sea turtles.
   The eggs were retrieved too late to save them, said Lt. Jim
Huffstodt, of the state Game and Freshwater Fish Commission.
   Huffstodt said the officers spotted four people on a beach near
the entrance to John D. McArthur State Park early Saturday morning.
   ``We had been patrolling... because this is the time of year
when the big turtles come up to lay their eggs and some people
collect the eggs to sell them as food and as an aphrodisiac,''
Huffstodt said Saturday.
   The eggs are sold for about $2 each, he said.
   Officers Ken Parrmore and Ros Welborn checked the beach after
the suspects left and found four broken turtle eggs, which are
similar in size to a chicken egg, Huffstodt. The officers stopped
the suspects' car two miles down the road in Riviera Beach, about
75 miles north of Miami on the Atlantic Coast.
   The four were charged with unlawful possession of marine turtle
eggs, Huffstodt said.
   ``Later we counted them and we found 1,088 eggs,'' he said.
   He said the eggs weren't viable because they had been greatly
disturbed. The eggs were put in a freezer to be kept for evidence.
   The eggs are believed to be either those of the threatened
loggerhead turtle or the endangered green turtle, he said. Green
turtles average 39 inches long and weigh 330 pounds. The
reddish-brown loggerhead averages 37 inches in length and weighs
275 pounds.
   ``Normally a sea turtle will lay between 60 and 100 eggs when
she comes ashore. Certainly these people in their evening's work
had raided 10 or more nests,'' Huffstodt said.
   Charged were Riveria Beach residents Enous Lewis Jr., 33;
Roosevelt U. Paulk, 27; James E. Bivins, 36; and Joyce Allen, 33.
   The maximum penalty for the offense is a $1,000 fine and a year
in jail.

   Police say they may have solved up to 20 extortion
cases with the arrests of two men who allegedly faked kidnappings
to get money from anxious relatives.
   The two Boston men were arrested Friday and Saturday and are
slated for arraignment Monday on extortion charges.
   They allegedly called a man in suburban Malden and told him they
had kidnapped his nephew and demanded $850 ransom.
   Actually, the nephew had not been abducted, and the hoax was
similar to numerous incidents reported to police.
   ``This has been going on for about a year,'' said Detective Sgt.
William Lang. ``They've been luring people in from the suburbs.
They've never really had anybody.
   ``They just know who these people are, they know their nephew's
names and they know (relatives) won't be able to get hold of them.''
   The break in the case came Friday when the Malden resident,
whose name was not released, told police about the call and ransom
demand.
   The man was told to take the money to a street corner in
Boston's Mattapan section.
   Lang and Malden Police Capt. Raymond Harris took the man's
place, posing as relatives, and made the first arrest.
   ``We're going to be able to clear up a lot of these
extortions,'' said Lang. ``I have 20 reports on my desk right now
of people who have been lured out there.
   ``I hate to think about how many people were too embarrassed to
report anything.''
   Malvin Turner, 26, was arrested Friday; Kenneth Golden, 25, was
taken into custody Saturday.

<TEXT>
   An astrologer has been named to advise one
of Oregon's county commissions, but she says the controversy
surrounding her appointment may prevent her from studying the stars
for Union County.
   Jenny Nicholson was named to the newly created post during the
county commission's regular meeting last week in La Grande, a
farming and timber community of about 12,000 in northeastern Oregon.
   ``What the heck. If the Reagan administration is rumored as
using astrology, I guess we can try it on the local level as
well,'' said county Judge John Howard, a member of the commission
who voted in favor of the appointment.
   Former White House chief of staff Donald Regan disclosed last
month in his book, ``For The Record,'' that Nancy Reagan consulted
an astrologer for aid in helping to prepare President Reagan's
schedule. Mrs. Reagan refused to comment on Regan's assertions.
   In a telephone interview over the weekend from her home in La
Grande, Nicholson said she intended to offer the commissioners
advice on such things as when to apply for government grants and
when best to make presentations.
   ``It was just going to be my community service,'' she said of
the non-paying position.
   But she said the whole idea might be dropped because of
criticism directed by the local newspaper and others at the two
commissioners who voted for her.
   Nicholson, 38, said she moved to La Grande in 1980 from Salem,
where she was a social service worker. The single mother of two
girls, aged 11 and 16, said she supports her family with her
astrology business, ``Otter Space.''
   Nicholson said she had been practicing astrology for 20 years
and that her list of clients from around Oregon and throughout the
West Coast might ``surprise some people.''
   Nicholson said she wanted to do her part to help the county pull
itself out of recent economic doldrums.
   No major governmental decision should be made based on an
astrologer's recommendations, but there is a place for astrology in
government, she said.
   ``There are cycles,'' she said. ``There are heavenly rhythms.''
   In La Grande's case, she said, the time is right to build
bridges with officials in Salem, the state capital.
   ``La Grande is in an extremely high profile ... to get some help
from Salem,'' she said.
   Commissioner Bill Deering, who nominated Nicholson for the job,
said he didn't think it would do any harm to get some astrological
advice, especially since Nicholson is a volunteer.
   ``We need all the help we can with our grants,'' Deering said.
``I respect Jenny greatly and I think her abilities may indeed help
us.''
   Commissioner Marie Lester, however, who abstained from the vote,
said she thought Deering's motion was a joke, adding that she would
have voted against it if she'd known he was serious.
   ``I will not make a decision based on (astrology) nor will I
support the county court making decisions based on that,'' she said.
   In Union County, the county commission is officially known as
the court; the head of the commission is called a judge.
   Lester said she planned a motion at the commission's next
meeting on July 20 to rescind the decision.
   Howard, the judge, said he doesn't take the whole thing
seriously but thinks Nicholson's abilities could be applied to
grant applications.
   ``We may want to talk to her about what day to apply for grants,
just for trial and error to see what happens,'' he said.

   Tribal extremists hurled a bomb at

   The news agency said several of the injured were in serious
condition but did not give further details.
   Police cordoned off the area around the cinema and began hunting

   Members of the Bodo tribe who are fighting for a separate state
for their community were believed responsible for the blast, the

   At least seven people were killed and 59 injured in three
explosions in June near the town of Barpeta Road, in north Assam.
The explosions were also blamed on Bodo militants.

   Gunmen believed to be Sikh militants
killed at least 12 people in the northern state of Punjab,
including four members of a Sikh family, the Press Trust of India
said Sunday.
   The news agency said the attacks occurred Saturday night. It
said three militants entered a home near the town of Hoshiarpur and
opened fire with automatic rifles, killing Gyan Singh, his brother,
Swaran, his son, Devinder, and another family member, Charanjit
Singh.
   The town is 210 miles north of New Delhi.
   The news agency said eight other people, including six Sikhs,
were killed by militants in other parts of the state on Saturday
night.
   No arrests were reported.
   Sikhs form only 2 percent of India's 800 million people but are
a majority in Punjab.
   Radical Sikhs have been fighting for a separate state in Punjab
since 1983, claiming discrimination by India's Hindu majority.
   The latest killings raise to 1,492 the number of people killed
this year in Punjab in Sikh violence.
   Victims of the Sikh separatist insurgency include many moderate
Sikhs, whom the militants accuse of being traitors or police
informers.

   Edwina Barry, who shared billing with such
top vaudeville stars as Sophie Tucker, Eddie Cantor, Al Jolson and
Harry Lauder, has died of pneumonia complicated by a heart ailment.
She was 102.
   Miss Barry, who left no survivors, died Thursday. A June 29
birthday celebration for her had to be canceled when she fell ill,
said Actors Fund spokesman Dale Olson.
   Miss Barry was born July 3, 1886 in Boston, the daughter of the
manager of the Howard Theater.
   After attending the Sisters of Notre Dame Convent, she began
theatrical training, appearing in stock companies playing boy's
parts, then as an ingenue.
   Her first starring role was in Porter J. White's ``Faust,''
followed by ``The Home Breaker,'' written by her brother.
   During World War I, she appeared in Europe, South Africa and
Australia. She had her own radio talk show in the late 1940s in
Shanghai and wrote columns for American newspapers.
   At Miss Barry's request, there were no services.

<HEAD>NTSB To Hold Four-Day Inquiry Into Aloha Jet Accident</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Transportation Safety Board convenes
a four-day hearing this week to try to find out why an 18-foot
chunk ripped away from a Boeing 737 jetliner over Hawaii and what
lessons that accident can teach about the airworthiness of older
aircraft.
   The hearing's main purpose is to help determine the cause of the
April 28 accident, but NTSB officials say the board also wants to
look at how well aging planes are maintained and how corrosion and
fatigue affect their safety.
   The four-day public hearing will open Tuesday.
   A flight attendant was swept to her death and 61 of the 94 other
people aboard Aloha Airlines Flight 243 were injured when a top
portion of the cabin peeled away, as the plane was at 24,000 feet
on a flight from Hilo to Honolulu.
   Although one of the two engines quit, the pilot and co-pilot
managed to control the crippled jet and land it safely on the
island of Maui 13 minutes later. Aviation experts marveled a plane
that badly damaged could land at all.
   The accident spurred a debate within the aircraft industry and
its regulators on the safety of older, heavily used passenger jets.
   The damaged plane, N73711, was built in 1969 and had 89,680
landings. It and two other Aloha 737-200s, both later grounded, had
the highest number of landings, or cycles, of any Boeing Co.
commercial jets, the Seattle-based aircraft manufacturer said.
   Since the acccident, the Federal Aviation Administration has
ordered inspections and repairs of older, high-cycle 737s and in
early June held a three-day conference on aging aircraft.
   Boeing officials have repeatedly said their jets can be flown
almost indefinitely if properly maintained. And Aloha officials
have said they performed all necessary maintenance on their
aircraft.
   But in documents released by the NTSB, Boeing said that seven
months before the accident, it had urged Aloha to make a thorough
structural inspection of N73711 and three other aging 737s.
   Boeing said Aloha, after first agreeing to the inspections in
early 1988, postponed them until the end of this year. Only after a
mid-April meeting with Boeing did the airline agree to reinstate
the inspection program for the four planes, Boeing said.
   In separate documents, Aloha denied it had delayed the
stepped-up inspection and maintenance program.
   Although the inquiry board will examine discrepancies between
the two companies' accounts, the hearing is investigative in nature
and not adversarial, said Boeing spokesman Jack Gamble.
   ``My understanding is that it will be very technical,'' said
Aloha spokesman Milton Goto, adding that the airline will have its
top maintenance and engineering people on hand to testify.
   NTSB spokesman Mike Benson said witnesses from the FAA, Boeing,
Aloha, the Air Transport Association and Britain's Civil Aviation
Authority are expected to testify, along with aerospace experts
from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the State University
of New York.
   The four-member inquiry board is made up of senior safety board
officials and chaired by NTSB member John K. Lauber, Benson said.
   The NTSB chose Seattle for the hearing because Boeing is based
here and it's roughly equidistant from Hawaii and NTSB headquarters
in Washington, Benson said.

   Tennis superstar Martina Navratilova has
purchased property near Aspen that includes a popular access route
to the Hayden Peak Recreational Area and plans to build a home
there, her attorney says.
   But she doesn't intend to close off public access to the
recreation area, said Aspen attorney Jane Ellen Hamilton.
   ``It's never been her intention to close it off,'' said Hamilton.
   North of Aspen, a battle has been brewing for 14 months between

   The man who presides over television's
``People's Court'' says judges should not be the people's choice.
   Joseph Wapner, a retired Los Angeles Superior Court judge, said
here Saturday that judges on all levels should be appointed and not
elected, with judicial review commissions to remove or discipline
them for improprieties.
   Among other things, Wapner said campaign fund-raising beholdens
judges to contributors and makes it difficult for them to be fair
and impartial.
   ``How can you be independent?'' he asked. ``Judges shouldn't run
as partisans because they have to be neutral. It's more important
to have an independent judiciary.''
   He participated in a panel discussion on judicial selection and
ethics at the National Judicial College here. The school, which
specializes in training judges from across the nation, celebrated
its 25th anniversary this weekend.

   An estimated 30,000 fans showed up
for the opening weekend of what the organizers say is Europe's
largest jazz festival featuring stars such as Herbie Hancock,
Lionel Hampton and David Sanborn.
   The 13th North Sea Jazz festival opened Friday with a concert by
U.S. trumpet player Miles Davis in the huge Congress Center here.
   Davis' concert began more than an hour late because he was
delayed when Dutch customs at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport
thoroughly inspected his equipment, said organizer Paul Ackett.
   ``Still, it was a grand concert,'' Ackett said.

   Roger Rabbit may live in Toon Town, but
his creator, Gary Wolf, remains attached to his hometown and often
wears his ``Future Farmers of America _ Earlville'' jacket on
Hollywood movie sets.
   Wolf says there is no direct link between the LaSalle County
town of 1,400 residents and the hit movie ```Who Framed Roger
Rabbit,'' except perhaps in the optimism he felt throughout his
youth. The movie is based on his 1981 novel ``Who Censored Roger
Rabbit?'',
   ``Growing up in the Midwest in the 1950s was a very optimistic,
happy time,'' recalled Wolf, 47, who now lives outside Boston.
``The movie and my book are similarly fun-loving.''
   ``Gary was always witty and creative,'' said one of his closest
childhood friends, John Myers, who now is coadjutor bishop of the
Roman Catholic Diocese of Peoria. ``Growing up in a small town
before television, there was a greater opportunity to develop an
imagination.''

   Las Vegas singer Wayne Newton is the
new owner of a stately Southern mansion that comes with its own set
of occupants.
   For years, ghosts have rocked on the wide veranda of the stately
Bay Side plantation house on summer evenings, or wandered through
the downstairs hall after midnight, says the former owner.
   Frank Hollowell Jr., third-generation owner of the 13-room
house, sold it and 11 acres of land to Newton two weeks ago for
$250,000.
   ``Everywhere I go people ask me about Wayne Newton,'' Hollowell
told The Charlotte Observer. ``I don't even know him or his music.''
   Newton saw an advertisement for the auction in an antiques
magazine and thought Bay Side would be a quiet retreat from the
casino lounges of Las Vegas where he sings. He was born in nearby
Norfolk, Va.
   ``I can't guarantee a ghost,'' Hollowell told the newspaper. But
he said he's heard one walking through the house, a guest once
awoke and saw a man sitting at the foot of her bed smoking a cigar,
which she could smell, and his wife saw a rocking chair moving by
itself.

   A huge tropical air current is
dominating the central Atlantic and could grow into the season's
first hurricane if it develops thunderstorms, the National
Hurricane Center said Sunday.
   The weather pattern developed off the African coast several days
ago and is nearly 1,000 miles wide, hurricane specialist Bob Case
said.
   At noon Sunday it was about midway between Africa and the Lesser
Antilles, the easternmost islands of the Caribbean, moving west at
20 to 25 mph.
   ``It's a very large and domineering wave, and it's about a month
ahead of its time,'' Case said. ``It bears watching.''
   Case said the hurricane center arranged for a reconnaissance
plane to study the pattern Tuesday if the air current ``continues
to be as impressive as it is now.''
   But unless it develops large thunderstorms, the weather pattern
has no chance of becoming a hurricane, Case said. ``It's like an
engine without fuel.''
   Nonetheless, he said, it bears close watching because of its
timing.
   ``It's a very, very well-defined system considering how early it
is in the season. Six weeks from now it would be ho-hum,'' he said.

   When Vermont lawmakers finish their
business late each spring, most members of the part-time, citizen
Legislature have to go back to work as teachers, lawyers and real
estate brokers.
   But not state Sen. David Deen. He's gone fishing.
   From the bustling halls of the Statehouse in Montpelier, Deen
heads for a shin-deep spot along the Big Bend of the Mettawee
River, changing from the tweed jacket of a lawmaker to the vest and
rubber boots of a fly-fishing guide.
   ``I've been busy since the session ended,'' he said on a recent
morning as he watched the cast of Jose Quinones, an
obstetrician-gynecologist from Queens, N.Y., and Deen's student for
the day.
   The Windham County Democrat paused for a moment to reflect on
how he gets to make a living fly-fishing while others toil in
offices and shops or on farms.
   ``I used to chuckle about it,'' he said. ``But hey, this is
work.''
   Deen recently had his first three days off since the legislative
session ended. ``I went fishing all three days,'' he said. ``I have
not tired of the sport just because I do it a lot.''
   Originally from Pennsylvania, Deen came to Westminster in 1971
to help his brother build a house.
   ``We camped out for the entire summer. It rained from June 7th
to July 4th.''
   He landed a job with Southeastern Vermont Community Action, an
anti-poverty agency in Brattleboro, and stayed there 10 years,
moving up to executive director.
   Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980. It was not a good
year for directors of government-funded community action agencies.
``I started looking around for something to save my sanity,'' Deen
said.
   His brother had given him a fly-fishing rod in 1979, and it
hadn't gotten much use at first. Eventually, though, Deen gave the
sport a try and soon was hooked.
   By 1983, Deen remained at Community Action, but was still
casting about for something else. ``I kept making lists of what I
liked to do and fishing kept coming up. ... So I decided to try
this.''
   Now Deen advertises his service, which he calls ``Strictly
Trout,'' in the Orvis fly-fishing catalogues and other publications
read by enthusiasts in the sport. He gets much of his business
through referrals.
   His day rate is $130 for the first person and $30 for each
additional person.
   It wasn't always so easy. ``For the first three years I was
hungry. I was lucky in that my wife has a good job (with the state
Health Department).'' If either of his two children had decided to
go to college, ``I would have had to get a straight job somewhere.''
   Despite less than perfect conditions, Quinones caught his first
trout early in the day.
   Deen told him a pointer he shares with his students: ``I throw
the fish back. I had a 16-inch rainbow in my hand two nights ago.
It went right back into the Connecticut River. ... I want the fish
to be here.''

   Iranian leaders expressed pessimism Sunday
that the U.N. Security Council will condemn the United States for
its destruction of an Iranian jetliner, but they said diplomatic
channels were still the best way to handle the issue.
   ``The Security Council faces one of the major tests of its
political history. The outcome of the debate will show how firmly
it holds to the United Nations Charter,'' said Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati.
   Velayati spoke to foreign reporters before traveling to New York
to attend Tuesday's emergency meeting of the council.
   Iran requested the debate on the July 3 downing of the Iranian
Airbus over the Persian Gulf. Iran said all 290 people on board
died in the incident. Velayati called it ``the most obvious case of
violation of basic rights of human beings and countries.''
   ``In view of the council's past performance and also due to its
peculiar composition, Iran is not too optimistic on the outcome of
the session,'' Velayati said.
   The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Vernon Walters, said
he was ``going to defend the circumstances under which this
occurred'' when the Security Council meets.
   He told ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley'' that above
all, he would urge that the way to prevent further such incidents
was to end the Iran-Iraq war.
   The Sunday Times of London reported that a British intelligence
report based on radio communications monitored in the Persian Gulf
is ``severely critical'' of the U.S. Navy for shooting down the
airliner.
   The report concludes that the Iran Air flight left Bandar Abbas,
Iran, for Dubai only three minutes late, was on the correct flight
path and was climbing when it was shot down, the newspaper said.
   The Navy has said the jet was descending and took off an hour
late. It said Navy forces mistook it for an Iranian F-14 jet
fighter.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Jawad Larijani said Iran
prefers to settle the issue of the jetliner through diplomatic
channels.
   The minister, speaking at a news conference, implied that a U.S.
veto of a possible Security Council resolution regarding the
disaster would not necessarily spark off a violent Iranian reaction.
   The United States, as one of the five permanent members of the
Security Council, has veto power.
   Asked what Iran's reaction would be if the United States vetoed
a resolution, he replied: ``Then we will pursue all the (other)
possibilities and channels. We prefer not to be hostile. We prefer
that this case should be settled diplomatically. But we are not
naive not to see the difficulties.''
   Larijani said any direct or indirect contacts with the United
States would serve no purpose, as long as Washington was
``consistently pursuing its policy of hostility toward Iran.''
   He said American policy was guided by a ``Genghis Khan'' view of
Iran. ``There is no hope for relations ... it is absurd even to
talk.''
   ``We are trying to contain the situation (in Iran),'' Larijani
added. ``I think to advocate a hostile line is not very reasonable.
I hope the situation will not be of such a case that no other way
will be possible.''
   Larijani's position reflected the policy advocated Friday by
Hashemi Rafsanjani, the speaker of Iran's parliament and acting
commande in chief of the armed forces.
   Rafsanjani, one of the most powerful figures in Iran, declared
that Iran should not seek revenge for the downing of the plane,
contradicting earlier statements by other Iranian leaders.
   ``The United States is trying to push us to commit the same
crime ... but if we did that, the world would turn against us. That
is why we do not push for revenge, wise people understand why,''
Rafsanjani said.
   Larijani referred repeatedly to the shooting down of the Airbus
as an ``incident,'' speaking only once of a ``barbaric act.''
   He also reiterated earlier statements that settling the incident
would require the United States to recognize its own responsibility
and to pay compensation to the families of the victims.
   The Reagan administration is likely to announce this week that
it will compensate the families of those who died, senior officials
said Sunday. ``We want to do the right thing,'' said Michael
Armacost, the undersecretary of State.
   Larijani did not repeat earlier Iranian demands that the U.S.
commanders involved in the incident be court-martialed.

   A British intelligence report based on radio
communications monitored in the Persian Gulf is ``severely
critical'' of the U.S. Navy for shooting down an Iranian airliner,
The Sunday Times of London reported.
   The report concludes that the Iran Air flight left Bandar Abbas,
Iran, for Dubai only three minutes late, was on the correct flight
path and was climbing when it was shot down, the newspaper said.
   The Navy has said the jet was descending toward the USS
Vincennes and that Navy troops thought it was an Iranian fighter
jet bearing down on them. The Pentagon has said the plane left
about 27 minutes late.
   Pentagon officials said Sunday they had no immediate comment on
the Times report.
   The newspaper said the report was based on conversations held
during the critical two hours leading to the shooting down of the
airplane, which had 290 people aboard. The conversations were
intercepted by the Government Communications Headquarters, the
newspaper said.
   The Government Communications Headquarters is Britain's top
secret intelligence-gathering agency, which has listening posts in
the Persian Gulf.
   The conversations include those between the aircraft and ground
control at Bandar Abbas, as well as efforts by the USS Vincennes to
warn the Iranian aircraft to change course, The Sunday Times said.
   Some of the conversations were also monitored by HMS Beaver, a
British frigate on patrol 50 miles away, it said.
   The report also suggested the initial confrontation that started
the shooting July 3 may have been provoked by American helicopters
flying into Iranian airspace, the newspaper said.

   Civic leaders in this financially
depressed town of 850 want to keep their farming community alive _
even if it means legalizing the consumption of liquor 55 years
after the end of Prohibition.
   Village officials want to put the idea to a vote in November;
they call it an economic development issue and a way to keep people
from moving out of town.
   ``Economic conditions are getting worse and worse,'' said Dwayne
Willems, mayor of the town about 60 miles northwest of Peoria.
   ``We're getting more and more empty buildings on Main Street. We
want to promote new business and increase traffic into town
somehow,'' he said.
   ``Right now, there's nothing to come here for,'' said Michael
McCready, owner of Credo's Cafe and a New Windsor village
trustee.``We want somebody who will run a nice tavern where couples
can go, maybe get a sandwich, and keep the rowdy types out.''
   New Windsor isn't much different from a lot of little farming
communities which have gone through hard times in the past decade.
   Many small family farms have disappeared, along with factory
jobs at John Deere, Caterpillar, Farmall, Case and International
Harvester in nearby cities. The jobs often supplemented farmers'
income.
   With its flag-lined Main Street, ``Welcome'' signs and colorful
flower beds in its city park, New Windsor looks in many ways like a
thriving all-American town.
   But there are some all-too-obvious signs of decline. Two banks,
a restaurant, gas station, a coin-operated laundry and grocery
store have all closed their doors.
   Salt and pepper shakers still stand next to napkin holders on
tables in Thurman's Ice Cream Shop, which closed about six weeks
ago.
   The biggest loss was the closing of the school district, which
includes nearby Viola and was annexed by a neighboring district
after running into financial trouble.
   Local leaders are on the verge of launching a petition drive to
get the referendum on the November ballot; they don't expect to
have any trouble rounding up signatures of 25 percent of registered
voters, Willems said Sunday.
   Although residents narrowly rejected a referendum to legalize
liquor consumption in 1974, Willems said that was during good
times, when people just didn't think they needed access to taverns.
   At the grain elevator, the farmers joke that towns like New
Windsor, Alpha and Viola are dry, but the people who live there
aren't. They say many people drive the seven miles to Woodhull or
other towns where beer and liquor flow.
   Not everyone in New Windsor agrees that a tavern in town is a
good idea.
   Bob Sherrard, a longtime insurance agent, said he believes
taverns only bring trouble to small towns.
   ``Let Woodhull keep the trouble,'' he said.

   President Lee Teng-hui proposed Sunday
that half the Central Committee of the governing Nationalist Party
resign to make room for younger members and more native Taiwanese.
   On the fourth day of the 13th party congress, Lee submitted the
names of 180 candidates for the committee, but they did not include
Chiang Wego, the powerful head of the National Security Council and
son of the late Chiang Kai-shek.
   The president's refusal to nominate Chiang Wego seemed designed
to end the rule of the family that for six decades led the
Nationalists and whose most politically influential figure _
President Chiang Ching-kuo, the eldest son of Chiang Kai-shek _
died in January.
   Most of Lee's nominees are expected to be elected Tuesday to the
180-member Central Committee, which makes policy proposals and
assesses party performance. Lee did not nominate at least 10 older
Nationalists from the current 31-member Central Standing Committee.
   The exclusion of the 10 older leaders indicated that Lee, who
was elected party chairman Friday, was seeking to reduce the
influence of conservatives loyal to the Chiang family.
   The leadership of the Nationalist Party, also known as the
Kuomintang, has long been dominated by Old Guard members who fled
to Taiwan with Chiang Kai-shek in 1949, when they lost a civil war
to the Communists on the Chinese mainland.
   The new Central Committee proposed by Lee would have an average
age of 60 _ a drop from the current average of 70. Lee proposed
that only 74 of 150 incumbents remain.
   Nationalist Party Spokesman Raymong Tai said the president wants
to combine new blood with half the old panel so the new committee
``can be forward-looking and can function well.''
   Lee is the first native Taiwanese to lead the Nationalists.
Forty-one percent of his slate is also native Taiwanese, who
comprise 85 percent of the island's nearly 20 million people.
   However, Chinese-born Nationalists hold a majority of seats in
Taiwan's Parliament.

<TEXT>
   Celebrating 1,000 years of Christianity in
what is now the Soviet Union, Pope John Paul II on Sunday embraced
the leader of Ukrainian Catholics and urged freedom of worship for
that underground church.
   Thousands of Ukrainian Catholics from the United States, Canada,
Europe, Australia and South America joined the pope in St. Peter's
Basilica for a nearly three-hour Mass said in the elaborate
Byzantine-Ukrainian rite.
   The Mass was the centerpiece of six days of celebrations in Rome
to mark the advent of Christianity a millennium ago in Kievan Rus,'
the ancient name of what is now the Ukraine, in the western Soviet
Union.
   John Paul recalled how Prince Vladimir converted to
Christianity, leading his people in a mass baptism on the banks of
the Dnieper River in 988.
   ``With all my heart I embrace you as your brother and the first
pope of Slavic origin in the history of the church,'' the
Polish-born pontiff said in Italian in his sermon.
   But, he noted, the Roman Catholic Church's joy at the
celebration ``is tinged with sadness in seeing that so many of your
brothers and sisters do not enjoy religious liberty, despite the
fact that this right has been reaffirmed many times in the
constitutions of the states and in solemn international documents.''
   The pope celebrated Mass with Cardinal Myroslav Ivan
Lubachivsky, who leads the Ukrainian Catholic community worldwide,
including an estimated 4 million followers in the Soviet Union and
about 2 million elsewhere.
   The late Soviet dictator Josef V. Stalin forced the Ukrainian
church in 1946 to officially join the state-sanctioned Russian
Orthodox church. Priests and the unwilling were jailed, deported,
or in some cases, shot.
   Lubachivsky, a Ukrainian-born American citizen, addressed the
pope just before the sermon, speaking in Ukrainian and then in
Italian.
   His voice cracked when he spoke of ``joy clouded over by the
fact that our brothers in the country can not freely profess our
faith and greet the successor of Peter,'' referring to the pope.
   The cardinal, wearing a gold hat studded with precious stones,
then stepped up to the pope, who kissed Lubachivsky on each cheek
and then kissed his hand to the applause of the audience, which
included gold-robed bishops of the Ukrainian church.
   Both the pope and the Ukrainian cardinal expressed hope for
unity with the Russian Orthodox Church.
   The pope recalled that last month he sent a Vatican delegation,
led by the Holy See's No. 2 official, Cardinal Agostino Casaroli,
to Moscow to attend millennium ceremonies of the Russian Orthodox
Church.
   The Ukrainian church broke with the Russian Orthodox in the 16th
century.
   Ukrainians make up about three-fourths of the republic's
population, while Russians constitute about 17 percent.
   The pope has expressed his desire to visit the Soviet Union, but
Vatican officials have said such a pilgrimage could only occur if
the pontiff can travel freely to meet with his flock, including the
Ukrainians.

   Like the vulture on his cap, Don
Schmidt waits for the unsuspecting _ boaters who run aground in
shallower-than-usual Lake St. Clair.
   ``They cruise through here ... fat, drunk and happy,'' Schmidt
said. ``Then the sand grabs hold of them, and that's all she wrote,
Bucko.
   ``It'll take me an hour to pull them out of there and an hour to
tow them. I'm a real pirate, let me tell you, kid.''
   Schmidt bills a stranded boater $85 an hour for a simple tow,
$150 an hour to pull a boat free after running aground and $330 an
hour for a boat that is so badly stuck that Schmidt has to use his
crane.
   During the past two years, the average depth of the lake between
lakes Huron and Erie has dropped by 2 feet, and this summer's
drought is dropping it even more.
   ``People just got used to the water levels being high,'' said
Lt. Henry Pfeilstucker of the Macomb County sheriff's department
marine division. ``They've got to start looking out, using the
charts and depth-finders again.''
   A depth-finder is one of Schmidt's main tools. He cruises until
his gauge reads 4 feet and waits for someone to run themselves
aground.
   In 1972, a year after Schmidt began Michigan Marine Salvage, one
customer got angry at the price of a tow.
   ``He started swearing and calling me a pirate and a vulture,''
Schmidt remembered. ``And I said, `Vulture, that's it. I've been
looking for a good logo,' and I gave him a job for free.''

   Farmer Willard Iblings asked for relief from
the drought in a big way, and got a reply in a big way.
   Iblings used his plow to carve out a 500-foot-high message in
his field in May.
   ``Need Rain,'' it said.
   Two days later, Iblings' farm about four miles north of Elgin
received an inch of rain. And since then, his farm has benefited
from an additional 4 to 5 inches of rain, bringing rainfall ``about
up to par now, maybe over.''
   As a result, while crops are dying in many parts of the state,
Iblings' spring wheat is healthy.
   However, because the rain was late, his yield per acre is
expected to be lower this year.
   ``Forty bushels is good yield for me, but I'd be satisfied with
30,'' this year, he said.

   Iran executed 10 ``counterrevolutionaries
and Iraqi spies'' on Sunday, Iranian television reported.
   The state-run television said the executions were carried out
after the sentences were reviewed and approved by the Supreme
Judicial Council in Tehran.
   The television, monitored in Cyprus, did not say exactly what
the charges were.
   The official media has blamed ``Iraqi agents'' for several
bombings throughout Iran in recent months in which a number of
civilians were reported injured. Iran and Iraq have been fighting
since 1980.
   Executions are usually by firing squad in Iran.

<HEAD>Dukakis Urges Federal Action To Fight Acid Rain</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ESTES PARK, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis toured scenic
Rocky Mountain parkland Sunday to highlight his support for
environmental issues and said people should pay higher electric
bills to finance the cleanup of pollution that causes acid rain.
   Dukakis, concluding a hurried Western campaign swing, turned up
the pressure on Republican George Bush over the vice president's
no-tax pledge and brushed aside prospects of potentially
contentious differences with Jesse Jackson going into the
Democratic National Convention next week.
   ``I think Jesse Jackson can do anything he wants to do. I'm
going to the convention and I'm going to win it,'' said Dukakis,
who has enough delegates to assure him the party's presidential
nomination at the convention in Atlanta.
   The Massachusetts governor traveled to Rocky Mountain National
Park northwest of Denver, where he walked around a 9,745-foot
elevation alpine lake, held a news conference and spoke to a small
group of supporters.
   He called for federal action to stop acid rain, a pollution
problem that has damaged lakes and forests of the Northeast and is
increasingly becoming an environmental concern in the West.
   He pointed to a proposal by Northeastern governors to collect
money for cleaning up emissions from electric generating plants,
blamed in part for the problem, by assessing a one-half cent per
kilowatt charge on electric bills.
   He said that amounts to 50-cents a month for the average family
and ``would not be too much to pay for cleaning up this serious
problem.''
   ``The fact of the matter is if we're going to clean up acid rain
in this country, there's going to be a cost,'' he said.
   ``So that's the way we're going to solve the acid rain problem,
and if Mr. Bush doesn't understand that he shouldn't be running for
president of the United States,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis hammered anew at Bush's promise not to raise taxes,
repeating his contention that the vice president is supporting what
amounts to higher taxes in the new trade bill and in legislation
extending catastrophic health coverage for the elderly. The health
bill would increase Medicare premiums and add an income tax
surcharge for covered Americans, and the trade bill would assess
certain excise taxes, he said.
   ``I'm for the bill,'' Dukakis said. ``But I want the vice
president to stand up and tell the truth, which is, that he and the
president supported a $6 billion tax increase to pay for needed
health insurance for the elderly in this country.
   ``And when the Congress gives him that new trade bill, they're
going to support another tax increase _ this time an excise on
imported goods to pay for a billion dollars worth of training and
retraining of American workers. I happen to be for that too _ and
so are they. So much for no-tax pledges.''
   He assailed the Reagan administration for failing to spend what
he said was $6 billion that has accumulated in a federal
conservation fund to protect and maintain federal parklands and
valuable wilderness areas.
   Dukakis stood in shirtsleeves and an open collar in an
amphitheater overlooking a valley within the park that has been
reclaimed from development and returned to its natural state. With
him were Gov. Roy Romer and Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo.
   ``I am an ardent conservationist. ... Preserving our environment
is a very conservative policy, and I'm for it,'' Dukakis said.
   The appearance was his last stop on a four-day tour through
Southwest, West Coast and Rocky Mountain regions _ his last
scheduled campaign swing before the convention. He stopped in
states that have gone Republican in recent presidential elections,
including giants California and Texas.
   ``We've made it clear we're not only not going to concede one
single state to the Republicans, we're going to win in the West,''
he said.
   Dukakis was returning to Boston for final deliberations on
selecting a vice presidential candidate and planned a trip to
Washington Tuesday night before meetings the next day with House
Democrats, the Congressional Black Caucus and the national
convention of the NAACP.
   Dukakis said he is ``not frustrated at all'' by Jackson's
refusal to concede him the nomination or posturing on the vice
presidency and convention issues.

   A 47-year-old man who uses a wheelchair
fatally stabbed his 86-year-old rest home roommate with a
pocketknife following a fight over their shared quarters, police
said Sunday.
   Vern Porter, a resident of Golden Manor Rest Home, was booked
for investigation of murder in the death of his roommate, Joseph
McMamamin, said Sgt. Carl Wilheite. Porter was being held without
bail.
   The two had argued around 9 p.m. Saturday over whether the
lights should be on in their room, said Hyman Ingber, manager of
the rest home.
   Porter was angry because McMamamin had turned the lights on,
Ingber said, adding, ``All of a sudden ... he stabbed him.''
   Ingber was not at the home at the time of the incident, but
arrived shortly afterward and talked to McMamamin before he was
taken to UCLA Medical Center, where he died.
   Porter was unable to walk because of injuries suffered in a
traffic accident, Ingber said. Porter used a wheel chair, Ingber
said, adding that he didn't know whether Porter was paralyzed.
   The two men had been roommates about three months, the length of
McMamamin's stay at the home, but had not argued much before,
Ingber said.
   ``This is a puzzle to me. A lot of people share the rooms. If
they argue, we separate them,'' he said.
   Porter, a student who attended classes three to five days a
week, had lived at the home for about two years, Ingber said.

<TEXT>
   A Canadian man who set up a fund in Washington
to aid Americans held hostage in Lebanon said Sunday he is about
ready to give up after collecting only $20 in six months.
   Gary Selby said he has spent more than $1,200 on telephone calls
communicating with hostages' families and trying to drum up
publicity for the Freedom Trust at Riggs National Bank in
Washington. Selby said he will likely dissolve the fund before the
end of the month.
   Money in the fund was to be distributed in equal shares to the
hostages when they were released, Selby said.
   Bank officials confirmed that the trust was formally established
in January but could not be contacted during the weekend to say how
much money was in the account.
   Selby, of Shawbridge, Quebec, said documents he receives as
trustee show the account currently holds $20, mostly in $1 checks
mailed from Pennsylvania after a radio station interviewed him. No
money has been withdrawn since the account was opened, he said.
   Selby said he has called scores of radio and television stations
and has been interviewed by several reporters, but contributions
barely trickled in.
   The bank, he said, apparently has been absorbing the cost of
keeping the trust. A Washington lawyer, Christopher Imlay, said he
drew up the trust agreement at Selby's request so that money could
be sent directly to the Riggs Bank in Washington.
   Imlay said in January that the trust does not allow Selby to be
paid anything, not even expenses.
   Selby, 32, said he earns about $160 a week in U.S. dollars
working on the night cleanup crew at a Montreal area McDonald's
hamburger restaurant.
   He said helping the American hostages has become an obsession
with him.
   ``I feel like I have to apologize to the families, because I got
their hopes up,'' Selby said in a telephone interview.
   ``I have to give it up or I'll go bankrupt,'' he said. ``It's
like a drug. It's like a part of me. I used to have terrible dreams
that I was being held hostage.''
   Selby said he had hoped to collect enough so the freed hostages
could spend a month in Hawaii or visit Disney World with their
families.
   Selby said he has always loved America and in 1984 gained some
notoriety with ``The Ballad of America,'' a monologue he wrote that
was recorded with music by Montreal disc jockey Ted Tevan and
played at a U.S. governors conference.
   Among Selby's prized possessions is a letter from President
Reagan praising him for writing the piece.
   Nine Americans are among 18 foreign hostages held by groups in
Lebanon. The longest-held hostage is Terry Anderson, 40, who was
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press when he
was abducted March 16, 1985.

   Opposition party supporters blocked
a bridge linking Mexico to the United States on Sunday and demanded
that the government admit defeat to their party in three
congressional races.
   ``This is to put pressure on the government to let it know the
people will defend their vote,'' said Francisco Barrio, a former
Ciudad Juarez mayor who led more than 1,000 National Action Party
supporters to the Corboba bridge Saturday night.
   Police and the army stayed away from the blocked bridge, where
hundreds of PAN members waved party flags, sat on mattresses and
blankets, listened to music or sang in groups.
   On Saturday night, they set up portable television sets and
watched soccer, and they vowed to remain on the four-lane bridge
until their demands for release of election results and recognition
of PAN victories were met.
   The occupation of the bridge linking Ciudad Juarez with El Paso,
Texas, was one of several coordinated actions of civil disobedience
by PAN backers in northern Chihuahua state.
   Officials of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party in
Ciudad Juarez said they will challenge the results of any PAN
victories.
   The Pan American highway outside the state capital of Chihuahua,
200 miles south of the U.S. border, was blocked by party members
Saturday night at the same time as the bridge takeover in Ciudad
Juarez.
   Similar traffic stoppages took place in the cities of Delicias,
Jimenez and Parral, all in Chihuahua state.
   ``We are here to defend our vote,'' said Ignacio Montemayor, who
came to the bridge with his wife, Lidia, and 8-year-old daughter
Claudia.
   ``We want to protest against this corrupt government that shames
us before the rest of the world,'' he said.
   The government postponed releasing results from Wednesday's
general elections, and opposition parties claim massive vote
rigging by the government and the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party, PRI.
   Under the election code, district committees should have results
Sunday, but it wasn't clear when the Federal Election Commission
would give the complete results of the vote.
   PRI has claimed victory for its presidential candidate, Carlos
Salinas de Gortari. Leftist opposition leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas
also claimed victory. The third major candidate, Manuel J.
Clouthier of PAN, said Saturday that a count carried out by his
supporters showed him ahead.
   PAN officials showed copies of polling booth certificates signed
by all parties to back up its claim to victory in three districts.

   A new police camera designed to
catch tailgaters or reckless drivers shot a picture of a couple
kissing at 84 mph, and the driver could lose his license, news
reports said.
   The Frankfurt Abendpost newspaper said Saturday the couple's
picture was snapped as they sped along a highway smooching behind
the wheel.
   West German television reported that the driver faced a
six-month suspension of his license if convicted of reckless
driving.
   The couple was not identified.
   The newspaper said the photo was taken on a highway near Munich.
   Police are trying to reduce accidents on the heavily-traveled
highways and introduced the new cameras to augment other
radar-triggered cameras that snap pictures of license plates of
offending vehicles.
   The tickets are mailed to the motorists.

<TEXT>
   The chief of the general
staff of the Soviet military inspected the cockpit of a B1 bomber
and visited a training center for missile crews Sunday as part of a
tour he said will help advance the cause of peace.
   Sergei Akhromeyev, speaking through an interpreter, said his
tour of U.S. military installations in the past few days with Adm.
William Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
demonstrated that American military personnel are competent and
want peace.
   ``Of course the military might of the United States armed
services and of the U.S. Air Force in particular is high, but I
knew that before I arrived in the United States,'' Akhromeyev said.
   But Akhromeyev, second only to the defense minister in the
Soviet military command, said he knew very little about American
military personnel before his visit.
   ``The impressions I'm taking home of the armed services
personnel are most favorable,'' Akhromeyev said. ``I also got from
the interviews I received from your military people you are
peace-loving people.''
   Akhromeyev and other Soviet military officials made the tour as
part of an accord reached at the latest summit meeting between
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, at which the
two leaders agreed to allow inspections of some military
installations.
   Ellsworth Air Force Base outside Rapid City, S.D., has 34 B1
bombers, the largest contingent of the four U.S. military bases
that operate the long-range bomber designed to fly at fast speed
and low altitude. The base also controls 150 Minuteman II
intercontinental nuclear missiles.
   During his tour, Akhromeyev climbed into a B1 bomber cockpit,
toured a training center for missile launch crews and watched crews
of seven airplanes demonstrate a response to an emergency alert on
the ground.
   Lt. Col. Tony Beat, a B1 pilot, said the Soviets were not
allowed to see the bomber's control system in operation.
   ``Unless we actually power up the system, anything you see
inside would not be classified,'' Beat said. ``We're interested in
showing them our favorite dishes, but we're not going to give them
the recipes.''
   After Akhromeyev arrived at the base, a B1 bomber took off and
put on a brief display, including a steep climbing turn that
Ellsworth personnel said they had not seen before.
   An F-15 fighter plane also put on an aerial display that
included a spinning vertical climb out of sight into the clouds
over the air base.
   Air Force officials said Akhromeyev and his party of 11 other
senior Soviet military leaders received no classified information
and saw no secret equipment.

   Buddhist leaders have overcome
neighborhood resistance toward building the largest Buddhist temple
in North America and are racing to finish the 15-acre complex in
time for the religion's international conference this November.
   The complex will be known as the Hsi Lai Buddhist Temple, ``the
temple that came to the West from the East,'' said Rev. Shih Yung
Kai, abbess of the temple.
   It sits on a hill 20 miles east of Los Angeles in this
upper-middle-class neighborhood, one of many suburbs swollen by a
huge influx of Asians in recent years.
   The Taiwan-based Fo Kuang Shan Buddhist society is building the
temple and will be host of the 16th International Buddhist General
Conference there in November, the first time this gathering will be
held in the West. The conference, entitled ``Unity for World
Peace,'' is expected to attract 300 participants from 40 countries,
Ms. Yung Kai said.
   When plans for the $14 million temple and monastery were
announced six years ago, some neighbors feared it would disrupt
this quiet residential area.
   ``Many people in the community don't know much about Buddhism,
and that can bring suspicion,'' she said. ``Above all we want
people to know we're not a cult, something strange. I think people
here now understand that.''
   Buddhism was founded in India about 500 B.C. by Buddha. The
religion's roughly 250 million followers, mainly in Asia, believe
that correct thinking and self-denial will enable their souls to
reach nirvana, a state of ultimate enlightenment. There are fewer
than a million Buddhists in North America.
   The Rev. Paul Louie, a now-retired Presbyterian minister,
organized several public meetings between local residents and
temple representatives.
   ``There was suspicion about the temple but also resistance due
to the fact that lots of Asians were moving into that
neighborhood,'' he said.
   ``Some residents thought it would be some kind of religious
cult, some kind of Hare Krishna thing with people chanting and
parading through the streets with tambourines. Of course, it's
nothing like that.''
   Barbara Lee Fish of the Hacienda Heights Improvement Association
said those fears are ``a thing of the past.''
   ``We're a community that's pulling together,'' she said. ``I
think the great majority of residents here will welcome the temple
when they open their doors.''
   Fears that home prices would plunge also have abated, according
to real estate agent Wayne Grey. ``Property values have actually
skyrocketed in the area,'' he said.
   Construction and legal problems arose in trying to build a
Chinese-style complex while accommodating Los Angeles County
building codes, Western construction methods and ``American ways of
doing things,'' according to architect Anthony Yang.
   Still, ``there's no doubt in my mind that we'll finish the work
by the (Nov. 1) deadline,'' said Steve Frank, spokesman for
Technical Management Services, the building contractor.
   The 10-building complex is a scaled-down replica of the mammoth,
ornate Fo Kuang Shan temple in Taipei, and will include a main
shrine, a monastery for 50 monks and nuns, a library and meeting
rooms.
   At the site last week, workers were installing more than 1,000
Buddha statues, each about a foot tall, on the walls of the main
shrine, a cavernous hall that will hold 800 worshipers. The
shrine's centerpiece, a two-ton golden chandelier made of dangling
gold-plated bells, will hang 50 feet above the marble floor, Ms.
Yung Kai said.
   Presbyterian minister Larry Boles, whose church is in the long
shadow cast by the hillside temple, said residents have been
awe-struck by the construction over the last three years.
   ``In the beginning it was just a bit of activity on the hill,''
he said. ``It went from a few little wooden structures to what it
is now _ something that looks like a giant, glittering palace.''

<HEAD>Central Committee To Discuss Economic Reform Alternatives</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The communist party daily in an
unprecedented report has detailed two variations for long-term
economic development and reform to be discussed by the party
leadership at a meeting this week.
   Hungary's Premier and party leader, Karoly Grosz, has been
quoted as saying the Central Committee meeting which begins
Wednesday is to be broadcast live on television and radio, also an
first-time event.
   The report Saturday in the party daily Nepszabadsag marked the
first time a detailed agenda for a Central Committee meeting was
published in advance. It outlined a what it called a radical
market-oriented reform proposal and a more moderate path that would
introduce reform gradually.
   In a separate article in Nepszabadsag, Rezso Nyers, considered
the father of Hungary's 1968 economic reforms, warned the
``disorder'' which accompanies reform should not lead to a
rejection of change.
   ``Crisis is ... social acknowledgement that things have to be
done in a different way,'' said Nyers, recently reappointed to the
ruling Politburo after having been ousted from that body in 1975.
   ``At the beginning any reform looks like disorder versus an
orderly state,'' Nyers told the daily. ``If this disorder goes
beyond a certain limit, even masses of people might call for
order.''
   Nyers said ``the great test of reform policy'' was keeping the
``disorder'' limited.
   Nepszabadsag, in its report on the two economic proposals to be
discussed by the Central Committee, said the first variation up for
discussion would focus on ``radical restructuring'' towards a more
market oriented economy that could, however, lead to 80,000 to
100,000 unemployed and result in greater social tensions in the
wake of reduced living standards.
   The second variation ``could be seen as a more consistent
continuation of the practice followed until now,'' introducing
reforms more gradually, the paper said.
   Unemployment would remain within the limits of 30,000 to 50,000.
Unemployment was expected to reach about 50,000 already this year.
   The paper said that although the second option would mean less
social tensions in the short-term, the danger of falling behind
international norms ``would not disappear.''
   Nyers in his interview said he had always been an advocate of
``reform-minded communism,'' saying the country must reject the
1950s. ``My stand is politically and ideologically breaking away
without any acquittal,'' Nyers was quoted as saying.
   If the Hungarian and other Communist parties do not do so,
``they would be unable to change the situation as it ought to be
changed,'' Nyers said.
   Popular revulsion against the repressive communist regime of
Matyas Rakosi, a protege of Soviet dictator Josef V. Stalin,
sparked the 1956 uprising in Hungary which was quelled by Soviet
forces.

   Thunderstorms dumped locally heavy rain on parts of Texas on
Sunday, and thunderstorms also were scattered over the parched
Midwest and the South.
   Temperatures hit 100 along the East Coast.
   Slow-moving storms dumped rain on parts of northwestern Texas,
where the ground was saturated from heavy rainfall the previous
several days, and some streets and highways were flooded, the
National Weather Service said.
   Showers and thunderstorms also were scattered from the Great
Lakes region through the middle Mississippi Valley along a cold
front that was slowly pushing eastward, bringing relief from the
latest heat wave over the Ohio Valley.
   Severe thunderstorm watches were issued for parts of Michigan,
Indiana and Ohio.
   Much of Iowa had picked up at least a half-inch of rainfall
since Saturday morning, not enough to dent the drought. Parts of
southwestern Iowa measured up to 2 inches of rain, parts of central
Iowa got up to 3 inches and Lansing, in the northeastern corner,
picked up 3.85 inches.
   Showers and thunderstorms also clustered across much of the
lower Mississippi Valley and the central Gulf Coast region, and
showers and thunderstorms also were scattered in northwestern and
central Florida.
   Showers and thunderstorms were accompanied by high wind and
small hail from western parts of Virginia into western North
Carolina. The storms also were scattered from northern Maine
southwestward into northern parts of New Hampshire and Vermont.
   Elsewhere, thunderstorms developed along the eastern foothills
of the Colorado Rockies, and in central and eastern Wyoming.
   High temperatures soared above 90 degrees across parts of the
East Coast, reaching 98 at New York City and 100 at Washington.
Baltimore's airport hit a record 100 and Roanoke, Va., reached a
record 96. The record of 95 was tied at Buffalo, N.Y., giving the
city its seventh consecutive day of records.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55
degrees at Crescent City, Calif., to 107 at Las Vegas, Nev. The
early-morning low for the day was 37 at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Monday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from the upper and middle Rio Grande Valley of Texas through the
southern Plains, Arkansas and the lower Mississippi Valley, the
lower Ohio and Tennessee valleys, the Gulf Coast, Florida and much
of the Atlantic Coast region into New England. Thunderstorms
developing in the afternoon were forecast along the high Plains of
South Dakota, Wyoming and Nebraska.
   Highs in the 70s were predicted along the Pacific Coast into
western and central Washington state, and in much of the northern
Plains; between 100 and 110 degrees across the desert Southwest;
and in the 80s or 90s across most of the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Ten Legislators Go On Hunger Strike To Protest Health Crisis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten opposition lawmakers began a hunger strike
Sunday to force the government to solve a crisis in Israel's public
health system, plagued by months of labor disputes.
   In an unusual show of unity, lawmakers from opposite ends of the
political spectrum gathered in the hallway of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's office to launch their protest.
   They said they would fast for a week unless an agreement was
reached before then between the Finance and Health ministries on
how to meet demands by doctors for drastic salary increases.
   ``We are doing this because there is no other alternative,''
legislator Yossi Sarid of the left-wing Citizens Rights Movement
told Israel radio. ``Maybe now the government will listen.''
   Added Geula Cohen of the right-wing Tehiya Party: ``The common
denominator is human suffering which doesn't distinguish between
left-wingers from right-wingers.''
   The protest was organized by the left-wing Mapam party.
   In the past few months, doctors in Israeli hospitals have
repeatedly gone on strike and performed only emergency surgery to
press demands for higher wages. Doctors make about $750 a month.
   As a result of the persistent labor disputes, thousands of
Israelis have waited for months to be scheduled for crucial
operations. Doctors have acknowledged they expect some patients to
die because of delays in treatment.
   In a scenario typical of the past few months, doctors said they
would strike Monday in Israel's northern hospitals, and in other
regions during the remainder of the week.
   The Health Ministry has agreed in principle to the doctors'
demands, but Finance Minister Moshe Nissim has refused to allocate
additional funds to the Health Ministry to cover salary raises.
   The Finance Ministry is concerned a wage increase would trigger
across-the-board wage hikes in the public health system and fuel
inflation.
   Officials from the Finance and Health ministries were scheduled
to meet Monday with union representatives in another attempt to
solve the crisis.
   Israel television quoted Shamir as saying if no agreement is
reached at Monday's meeting he would convene a special ministerial
committee to make a decision this week.

   More than 100 former members of
Nazi German SS units attended the funeral of a former aide to Nazi
leader Adolf Hitler, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   Die Welt am Sonntag newspaper said former Hitler aide Richard
Schulze-Kossens died July 3 from lung cancer at the age of 73. His
funeral was held Friday in a Duesseldorf chapel, the newspaper said.
   Schulze-Kossens served as one of Hitler's adjutants from 1941 to
1944, the newspaper said.
   In 1944, he was promoted to a SS lieutenant colonel and named
head of a SS training school.
   After the Nazi defeat in 1945, Schulze-Kossens spent three years
in an American internment camp and later worked as a salesman and
writer, the newspaper said.
   Die Welt said Hitler's last personal adjutant, Otto Guensche,
accompanied Schulze-Kossens' widow to the services.
   Guensche reportedly was the Nazi aide who burned the bodies of
Hitler and Eva Braun after they committed suicide in Hitler's
Berlin bunker.
   Among the guests at the funeral were 100 former members of Nazi
SS units, many wearing the insignia of a group formed by SS
veterans to assist comrades after the war, the newspaper said.
   Die Welt said the casket was draped with wreathes bearing
tributes from several former SS units.
   Schulze-Kossens first served as an aide to Nazi Germany's
foreign minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, and was present when
Germany signed a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union in 1939.
   Die Welt said the former chief aide to SS leader Heinrich
Himmler, Werner Grothmann, a long-time friend of Schulze-Kossens,
was among two former Nazi officers who delivered eulogies during
the service.

   Joel Vavra successfully defended his title as
National Cluck Off Grand Champion at the Wayne Chicken Show and
said other squawkers were ``too chicken'' to get up on stage.
   Vavra, of Crete, swept the rooster-crowing category and then won
the Cluck Off for the second year in a row Saturday at the eighth
annual ``tongue-in-beak'' tribute to the chicken.
   The champ said he's sure someone could top his rendition of hen
and rooster calls, ``But they won't come on stage because they are
too chicken.''
   Gail Korn, a member of the chicken show committee, said the
event originated in 1980 when the Wayne Regional Arts Council
thought of having an arts show.
   When the chicken was mentioned, ``everbody started laughing, and
we haven't stopped,'' she said. ``We can't stop it now if we wanted
to.''

   Lee Eggen Jr.'s fishing tale of the one that
got away has a different twist, and the angler says he wants his
stolen sturgeon back.
   Eggen says he bagged a record sturgeon with his brother, Ron,
and their father, Lee Sr. The Eggens battled for two hours July 2
before reeling the fish in from the Moose Horn River.
   The next morning, they put the fish on a state-approved scale at
the Moose Lake Feed Store and it weighed 105 pounds, exceeding the
old state record for a fish caught by hook and line by 13 pounds.
   ``We'd have put it under lock and key and hired a guard if we'd
have thought that somebody would steal it,'' said Lee Jr. ``It's
only a fish. Who would expect that somebody would steal a fish?''
   Not the Eggens. They put the sturgeon in a freezer in the garage
of their Minneapolis home and waited for the Department of Natural
Resources to examine the fish and establish that it was caught
legally.
   Lee Jr. said he showed the fish to a friend Wednesday night, but
it was gone Thursday morning.
   ``Somebody just went in and took it sometime in the night,'' he
said. ``Until it's returned we don't have anything. Our attitudes
are real down.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Urges Bush to `Tell The Truth' on Fees Increase</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS lead to UPDATE; INSERTS grafs 11-12 with Bush comment</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis on Sunday urged rival George Bush to ``tell the
truth'' about whether his support for an increase in fees for
health coverage indicates the vice president favors an increase in
taxes. Bush, meanwhile, called for caution in dealing with the
Soviets.
   The vice president spent the weekend at his seaside retreat in
Kennebunkport, Maine, and sought the support of Lithuanians at a
local festival.
   Bush said last week that he favors higher fees for some
government services, including higher payments for Medicare
recipients under the catastrophic health care coverage of recent
legislation. Dukakis said Bush's plan amounts to raising taxes.
   ``I'm for the bill,'' Dukakis said as he campaigned in the
Denver area. ``But I want the vice president to stand up and tell
the truth, which is, that he and the president supported a $6
billion tax increase to pay for needed health insurance for the
elderly in this country.''
   The all-but-certain Democratic nominee turned aside questions
about a possible clash with opponent Jesse Jackson at the national
convention in Atlanta next week.
   ``I think Jesse Jackson can do anything he wants to do,''
Dukakis said. ``I'm going to the convention and I'm going to win
it.''
   Jackson denied reports on Saturday that he and his delegates
might stage a walkout at the convention. ``The threat is not that
we're going to walk out. The threat is that we're going to stay and
expand and build and grow and make a difference,'' Jackson said.
   He gave no indication of surrendering to Dukakis, who has
amassed the number of delegates needed to win the nomination on the
first ballot.
   ``My name will be in nomination,'' Jackson said. ``We will have
(platform) planks on the floor, those that are not resolved between
now and that time, and that should be a reasonable expectation.''
   Bush, putting politics on hold for the summer weekend, delivered
a non-partisan speech to a Lithuanian festival held at a
40-year-old Franciscan monastery.
   Citing reforms in the Soviet Union under Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, the vice president said, ``This is a time of change in
the Soviet Union, and for the Lithuanian people, it is a time for
hope.''
   But, he added, ``If this is a time for hope, it is not a time
for complacency or weakness. It is a time, I believe, to test
whether the reforms are genuine.''
   The likely Republican nominee also spent time on his boat and
attended Sunday church services with his family.
   Dukakis used a tour of the Rocky Mountains at Estes Park, Colo.,
to focus attention on environmental problems, including acid rain,
which kills trees and fish. Its effects have been felt mainly in
Canada and the Northeast.
   The Massachusetts governor suggested an increase in utility
payments for residential electricity customers amounting to 50
cents per family per month to help solve the problem.
   ``The fact of the matter is if we're going clean up acid rain in
this country there's going to be a cost,'' Dukakis said. ``That's
why we're going to solve the acid rain problem, and if Mr. Bush
doesn't understand that he shouldn't be running for president.''
   Dukakis planned to return to Boston to concentrate on the vice
presidential selection process, which entered the final stretch
with the convention just over a week away.
   ``I love picking people, I enjoy this process, it's an important
choice and I'm going to make it,'' Dukakis said when asked by
reporters about a possible running mate. ``I'm going to make it
with all the information, advice and counsel I can. I can't tell
you when that's going to be.''

<HEAD>Lithuanians Rally To Discuss Conference Results</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lithuania's delegates to a national Communist
Party conference told 100,000 people at a rally in the western
Soviet republic that their demands for more autonomy received a
warm response in the Kremlin, Tass said.
   The official Soviet news agency said the rally Saturday, led by
a group called the ``Lithuanian Movement for Perestroika,'' was
attented by residents of the republic's capital, Vilnius, and
Lithuanian delegates to last week's national party conference in
Moscow.
   ``Perestroika'' is the Russian word for Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's economic, cultural and political reform program.
   Tass quoted the delegates as telling the rally Lithuanians'
proposals for ``development of independence'' and expansion of
rights of the 15 Soviet republics, wider use of their national
languages and measures to preserve the environment were adopted at
the four-day Kremlin session that ended July 1.
   Members of the movement _ writers, scientists and cultural
figures _ spoke in favor of perestroika. The speakers condemned
stagnation and bureaucracy and declared their group rejects
``nationalist and extremist elements,'' Tass said.
   Similar groups have been formed in the two other Soviet
republics on the Baltic Sea _ Latvia and Estonia. The groups want
to assume financial control over industries in the republics from
ministries in Moscow, and also control over environmental and
cultural policies affecting their republics.
   At a rally in Vilnius on June 24, demonstrators carried
Lithuania's national flag, according to the Lithuanian Information
Center in New York, an emigre group. In earlier times, carrying the
flag used during Lithuania's brief independence between the world
wars would have prompted arrests. Now it is apparently tolerated by
local authorities.
   Many residents of the three Baltic republics resent the Soviet
takeover of their areas in 1940, conducted under a secret section
of a pact between Nazi Germany and the Kremlin the year before. The
United States and several other Western countries do not recognize
the Soviet takeover and consider the Baltic republics independent.
   In a separate report, Tass said a rally to commemorate the Jews
of Vilnius was held Friday. People gathered on the site of the
former Jewish ghetto in the capital to ask authorities to come up
with a way of ``perpetuating the memory of the people perished''
when Nazi forces swept through the area in 1941, massacring
thousands of Jews, virtually the entire Jewish population of the
area.

   A baby sitter dropped four young children
from a burning third-floor apartment into the safety of a
neighbor's arms before jumping to the ground herself and injuring
her back, officials said.
   The two-alarm blaze heavily damaged a three-story apartment
house Saturday and left 21 people homeless, including 12 children.
   At least 14 people were home when the fire broke out around
11:30 a.m. on a second-floor porch, but only Jacqueline Torres, the
20-year-old baby sitter, was injured, officials said.
   ``When the fire started, we ran through the house trying to get
the kids out,'' said Ronald Tucker, a neighbor. Fire blocked the
front of the third-floor apartment and the back door was locked, he
said.
   Torres stood at a back window while Tucker and other neighbors
yelled to her to drop the children, the oldest of whom is about 5,
Tucker said.
   ``She had no choice but to drop them,'' he said.
   Torres tossed the children into the arms of another neighbor,
Duane Holmes, before dropping herself from the window.
   ``I'll tell you the truth, I don't know how I caught those
kids,'' Holmes said. ``If I could have caught that woman, I damn
well would have.''
   Torres was listed in good condition Sunday with several
fractured vertebrae in her lower back, according to a nurse at St.
Francis Hospital and Medical Center.
   The children were placed temporarily with the state Division of
Children and Youth Services, a spokeswoman for the American Red
Cross said. Their parents were away for the weekend, she said.
   The Red Cross also arranged housing for other residents.
   Fire Capt. Edward K. Endee said his department has not
determined the cause of the blaze.

   A 22-foot motorboat smashed into a concrete
breakwall at the south end of Milwaukee's Lake Michigan harbor,
killing all three passengers, a Coast Guard spokesman said Sunday.
   Petty Officer Donald Jarman identified the victims as Robert
Gottfredsen, 43, owner of the boat; Jesus Placencia, 41; and Peter
Lawrence Back, 42. All three were from Racine.
   Jarman said the boat hit the south side of the breakwall about
300 yards offshore at 11:55 p.m. Saturday.
   ``The whole bow appeared to be disintegrated,'' Jarman said. The
boat was partially submerged after the crash and divers pulled the
bodies from the wreckage, he said.
   The cause of the crash was being investigated Sunday and
autopsies of the victims were scheduled, Jarman said.

   Afghan rebels bombarded cities and towns across
Afghanistan with rockets and artillery fire in a wave of attacks
that killed or wounded more than 150 civilians, Tass reported
Sunday.
   Tass said in a report from Kabul, the Afghan capital, that the
raids occurred over the past 48 hours. It said caravans carrying
weapons for the rebels were arriving from Pakistan.
   The Soviet military commander in Afghanistan said the Kremlin
might be forced to rethink its schedule for the withdrawal of
troops if Pakistan keeps sending aid to Afghan guerrillas, a
newspaper reported.
   Two caravans of 350 pack animals recently brought a ``large
amount'' of arms and ammunition to the outskirts of the town of
Talukana, the official Soviet news agency reported.
   The rebels used artillery and rockets to shell populated areas
in more than eight provinces, including the capital district of
Kabul, and more than 150 civilians were killed or wounded, Tass
said. In Samagan province alone, it said, 29 people, including 16
children, were killed in attacks on villages.
   ``In retaliation, the Afghan armed forces in a number of
provinces smashed extremist groups,'' Tass said, adding that
``several tens'' were killed. It said more than 20 insurgents died
when armed detachments from rival rebel groups battled among
themselves.
   Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov, the top Soviet soldier in Afghanistan,
stopped short of saying the Soviets might slow down or stop the
pullout of troops.
   Answering questions from the Krasnaya Zvezda military daily,
Gromov said all Soviet troops have now been withdrawn from the
eastern and southeastern provinces of Afghanistan.
   In April, the Soviets signed accords in Geneva that committed
them to begin withdrawing their more than 100,000 soldiers from
Afghanistan on May 15 and to complete the pullout within 10 months.
They intervened in Afghanistan in 1979 to back the government in
its war against anti-Marxist guerrillas.
   ``We are prepared to continue to implement strictly and
faithfully the provisions of the Geneva agreements,'' Gromov was
quoted as saying. ``Although I do not rule out that unceasing
violations of the provisions by Pakistan may lead, as was pointed
out in the recent statement of the U.S.S.R. Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, to a situation when appropriate conclusions will be made
as regards the timetable of the troop withdrawal.''
   He did not elaborate.
   The Foreign Ministry on May 28 said if Pakistan did not halt
``interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan,'' the Soviet
Union ``would draw pertinent conclusions with respect to the
timetable of the troop withdrawal and take concrete steps.''
   The Soviet Union has repeatedly complained that Pakistan is
violating the Geneva accord by sending arms to guerrillas fighting
the Kabul government and by allowing guerrilla training bases in
its territory.
   Gromov told the newspaper, ``As our troops are withdrawn from
provinces that border on Pakistan, the desire of the opposition to
give broader scope to fratricidal war becomes increasingly
noticeable. There are numerous facts which confirm that the
Pakistani side does not intend to observe the spirit and the letter
of the Geneva agreements.''
   The Communist Party daily Pravda also accused Pakistan on Sunday
of breaching the accords. Apparently referring to American arms
shipments to the Afghan guerrillas, Pravda said ``U.S. actions''
also ran counter to the spirit of the agreements.
   ``It is clear that the one who violates them assumes grave
responsibility for the consequences and for the disappointment of
the Afghans' hopes for a peaceful life,'' the paper said.
   The United States has been supplying the Afghan rebels with arms
and supplies channeled through Pakistan. It has vowed to continue
the supplies as long as the Soviet Union keeps up its military
support of the Afghan government.
   The Geneva accords prohibit Pakistani interference in
Afghanistan's affairs. But weapons supply from the Soviet Union is
not banned. A separate agreement signed by Moscow and Washington
allows the superpowers to continue supplying their respective
allies.

   Rescue workers found the burned body
of a missing Pennsylvania climber near the peak of an active
volcano that erupted, authorities said Sunday.
   U.S. Vice Consul Margaret Willingham identified the climber as
Steven Simmler, 35, of West Chester, Pa. She said he was found late
Saturday after a four-day search.
   A companion, Joshua Vendig, 22, of Los Angeles, said an eruption
began while he and Simmler were climbing the 4,900-foot Arenal
Volcano.
   Vendig said he and Simmler ran downhill in a shower of hot rock
and ash.
   ``Suddenly, everything became dark. And when it calmed down
Steve was lost,'' Vendig told The Associated Press.
   The volcano, 120 miles northeast of San Jose, has been active
since 1968. Officials at Costa Rica's Volcanic Observatory said the
eruption was normal activity for the volcano.
   Simmler was in Costa Rica as part of a student exchange program.
Vendig was there on vacation.

<HEAD>Iraq Claims To Recapture More Of Its Northeastern Mountains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq said its forces on Sunday recaptured
more of its strategic border peaks from Iranian troops in a second
day of battles in the mountainous northeastern region, a military
communique reported.
   The communique broadcast by state-run radio said a dozen heights
in Kurdistan and a border post near the town of Penjwin, seized by
Iran four years ago, have been retaken.
   There was no immediate Iranian comment to the latest Iraqi
claims. These followed Saturday's Iraqi claim that 14 peaks were
liberated in the Penjwin area after a four-day battle.
   Iranian military communiques, carried by the official Islamic
Republic News Agency in dispatches monitored in Cyprus, said only
that Iranian jets carried out 13 sorties against Iraqi troop
concentrations in various sectors of the extensive front line,
inflicting heavy losses.
   The agency said Iraqi forces shelled the southern city of
Khoramshahr, inflicting damage but no reported casualties, but the
Iraqi military spokesman denied the city was shelled.
   IRNA added that a number of civilians were killed following an
Iraqi artillery bombardment since Saturday afternoon of the town of
Sardasht, 50 miles northeast of Penjwin.
   It also said a civilian was killed and 150 were injured in an
Iraqi chemical-weapon raid in western Iran. Iraq denied carrying
out such a raid.
   The Iraqi News Agency said a military spokesman denied that
Sardasht had been shelled.
   ``These allegations are compltely baseless and untrue and they
are aired by the Iranian regime to cover up its successive defeats
at the hands of the Iraqi armed forces,'' INA quoted the spokesman
as saying.
   The Iraqi action to drive the Iranians out of the mountains of
Iraqi Kurdistan follows important Iraqi military victories in other
sectors of the front earlier this year in the countries' nearly
8-year-old war.
   The Iraqis retook Faw, an oil port at the southern end of the
battlefront, in April. They followed this up with the liberation of
the Shalamcheh region and the southern oil-rich Majnoon islands
last month.
   INA also reported that Iraq formally complained Sunday ``of the
new Iranian crime of killing prisoners of war.''
   The agency said Arab ambassadors accredited to Baghdad were
summoned to the Foreign Ministry and were given messages explaining
``the new Iranian crime.''
   INA did not give additional details beyond saying that an
unspecified number of Iraqi prisoners of war ``were brutally killed
after being tied with ropes.''
   It said the bodies were found when Iraqi troops retook the
Iranian-occupied town of Mawat, in Iraqi Kurdistan, on May 15.
   In the Persian Gulf, two Iranian gunboats intercepted four
Kuwaiti fishing boats inside Kuwait's territorial waters but
released the occupants along with one boat, the Kuwait News Agency
reported Sunday.
   The agency, quoting an Interior Ministry official, said the
incident occurred Friday.
   Several Iranian islands lie close to Kuwaiti waters, including
Farsi which is a stronghold of Iranian armed speedboats that carry
out attacks on neutral shipping in the waterway in retaliation for
Iraqi strikes on Iranian oil routes.
   Despite repeated warnings from the Kuwaiti authorities,
fishermen often go close to the Iranian territorial waters in quest
of good catches.

<TEXT>
   Maoist guerrillas killed two farm co-op
officials in the highlands and killed two police rangers in an
ambush in a cocaine-trafficking jungle region, police said Sunday.
   The two police troopers died in an ambush along a jungle trail
before dawn Friday near Uchiza, a town 250 miles north of the
capital Lima in the heart of the Huallaga Valley, center of Peru's
illegal cocaine trade.
   Police said two other rangers were missing after the clash and
feared dead.
   The Huallaga Valley is the source of the coca used to produce
most of the cocaine that enters the United States. The coca is
partially refined into cocaine and smuggled in small planes to
Colombia, where it is purified.
   Police say the Shining Path has entered into a deadly alliance
with drug traffickers to provide them with protection in return for
money and guns.
   In other violence 10 hooded rebels seized an isolated farm
cooperative Wednesday night near Cajabamba, a town in the mountains
300 miles northwest of Lima, and fatally shot the co-op's president
and another official, police said.
   Counterinsurgency police, meanwhile, interrogated an Irish
priest and a West German aid worker detained with four Peruvian
women on suspicion of involvement with the fanatical Shining Path
guerrilla movement.
   Police identified the men as the Rev. Charles Gallaguer, an
Irish priest assigned to a parish in Lima, and Rainer Ulhe, a West
German citizen working with a Catholic Church-supported aid
foundation.
   The hometowns and ages of the men were not available.
   They were detained Saturday night in Ayacucho, the highland city
that is the stronghold of the Shining Path. Police also arrested
three church social workers and a woman who is vice president of an
Ayacucho human rights group.
   The six were detained after they returned from a visit to a jail
in Huanta, a town 20 miles north of Ayacucho, which is located high
in the Andes 230 miles southeast of Lima.
   The Shining Path launched its insurgency in Ayacucho in May 1980
after 10 years of clandestine political work in the surrounding
countryside. Since then the violence has spread through much of the
country and claimed more than 10,000 lives.

   A single-engine Cessna plane crashed on a
mountainside north of the capital in dense fog, killing all six
people aboard, a police official said Monday.
   Takashi Ogino of the Saitama Prefectural Police said the six
victims in Sunday afternoon's crash included two children.
   The six-seater Cessna was flying from Oshima island south of
Tokyo to an airport in Saitama when it crashed into a 1,237-foot
mountain in thick fog, Ogino said.
   The cause of the accident was under investigation.
   Ogino identified the six as pilot Kazunori Fujita, 37, Satoshi
Tanaka, 40, Tanaka's daughters, Junko, 8, and Yuko, 7, Kazuo
Satake, 37, and Yutaka Matsubara, 42.

   Officials closed two stretches of Long
Island beach Sunday after medical waste washed ashore, and crowds
at beaches that remained open were well below normal despite the
assurances of health officials and the sweltering heat.
   Meanwhile, Gov. Mario Cuomo promised a crackdown Sunday on
illegal ocean dumping after three dozen syringes, three blood
vials, vials associated with the drug crack and plastic tubing
washed ashore this past week, forcing the closure of 25 miles of
beach on Long Island's south shore over three days.
   ``Even though the amount of waste was small and no great harm
has yet been done, we should not await an environmental disaster to
occur before we act,'' he said.
   In a news release, Cuomo said he would urge the state
Legislature to provide for fines of up to $100,000 and jail terms
of up to 10 years for anyone convicted of illegally dumping
infectious material. He said he also planned to seek $2 million to
bolster enforcement of the current anti-dumping laws.
   Jones Beach State Park, the most popular public beach on Long
Island's south shore, attracted only about 80,000 people Sunday,
said Joseph Lescinski, park superintendent. That was up from 28,000
Saturday but well below the 200,000 beach-goers officials would
have expected.
   The weekend after the Fourth of July is typically the most
crowded of the summer, and the temperature climbed well into the
90s Sunday.
   New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Stephen C. Joseph said
Friday that syringes that washed up on a seven-mile beach in the
city's borough of Queens appeared to be of the type used by drug
addicts. The city's beaches were open over the weekend after having
been closed Friday.
   Farther east, Suffolk County officials prohibited swimming at
Smith Point Beach, after finding medical waste Sunday morning.
   Officials also prohibited swimming at Overlook Beach near the
town of Babylon on Sunday. A dozen syringes, plastic prescription
bottles and household trash washed up on the town's beaches
Saturday.
   Authorities first thought the medical-related trash was hospital
waste that had been illegally dumped, but they later said the
syringes and other items could have been used by drug addicts or
diabetics.

   Vice President George Bush said
Sunday that recent changes within the Soviet Union may herald ``a
time of hope'' for those living in eastern Europe but cautioned
against ``complacency or weakness'' in dealing with the Soviets.
   Addressing a Lithuanian festival, Bush challenged the Soviet
Union to make good on its reforms toward openness by relaxing its
grip on the nations it occupied after World War II.
   ``The United States has always condemned the violation of your
national sovereignity, and in the years ahead we will never condone
the forced occupation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   Bush spoke at a Lithuanian Franciscan monastery in this small
seacoast resort town where he has a vacation home.
   It was his only public appearance during a weekend of rest. And
his brief remarks were largely nonpartisan.
   The certain Republican presidential nominee said that despite
the recent thaw in U.S-Soviet relations, full compliance by the
Soviets with international agreements on human rights remains ``an
essential element in improving relations between our two
countries.''
   Still, Bush told the gathering on the monastery grounds, ``this
is a time of change in the Soviet Union, and for the Lithuanian
people, it is a time for hope.''
   ``There is hope because talk of nationalism is no longer merely
whispered behind closed doors. We see it shouted in the streets
during the demonstrations that grow larger by the day.''
   Bush cited the pullout of Soviet troops from Afghanistan as
further cause for hope of a change in Soviet policy.
   But, he added, ``If this is a time for hope, it is not a time
for complacency or weakness. It is a time, I believe, to test
whether the reforms are genuine.''
   The monastery where Bush spoke was founded by Franciscan fathers
who emigrated to southern Maine in 1947 when their country fell to
invading Soviets.
   After speaking, Bush and his wife Barbara watched a performance
by a Lithuanian-American dance troupe from Boston.
   Earlier, Bush attended a church service with his wife and his
87-year-old mother, Dorothy Walker Bush, at an Episopalian church
near his summer home.
   Otherwise, his weekend was taken up by fishing, boating and
family events, said spokeswoman Shelia Tate.
   ``He really came up here to relax,'' she said.
   Bush was to speak to an agricultural group on Monday and to
address an NAACP meeting in Washington on Tuesday. He also plans to
attend the All-Star baseball game in Cincinnati on Tuesday.
   Bush plans to do some campaigning during next week's Democratic
National Convention, although details of his schedule have not yet
been set, said Ms. Tate.
   In his speech at the monastery, Bush told a group of about
1,000, ``it is 48 years now since the Soviet Union invaded your
homeland and the other Baltic states. Tragically, many of you were
forced to flee Soviet persecution; your children may never know the
thrill of laughing and playing on Lithuanian soil.''
   He called for the release of Lithuanian political prisoners,
restoration of the right of Lithuanian Catholics to worship freely,
and ``restoring the birthright of freedom to the Lithuanian
people.''
   ``All of us look upon freedom as a gift, a gift from God,'' Bush
said. ``Accepting the suppression of the most fundamental human
freedoms would be turning our backs on our own values and
heritage.''
   ``Only the United States is strong enough and committed enough
to stand up for the freedoms of oppressed people all over the
world,'' he said.

<HEAD>Mike Reagan Appears in Ads for Diet Patch Banned by FDA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Reagan, the older son of President
Reagan, said he wants a commercial in which he endorses a diet aid
to be pulled from television if federal officials determine the
patches are being marketed illegally.
   Reagan appears in a 30-minute talk-show style commercial for an
appetite-control skin patch that the Food and Drug Administration
is investigating. He said he appeared in the commercial ``as an
actor.''
   The commercial, with Reagan acting as a talk show host, began
appearing on Los Angeles cable channel KSCI on June 7 and is
scheduled to run through the end of July.
   The FDA banned distribution of all such diet patches in mid-May
because they are classified as drugs and require FDA approval for
sale to the public, said FDA compliance officer Greg Nelson. The
agency only found out about the brand of patches Reagan advertised
within the past two weeks, he said.
   Reagan, the 43-year-old adopted son of the president and his
first wife, actress Jane Wyman, told the Los Angeles Daily News he
wants the advertisement to be taken off the air if the FDA
determines that the patches are being marketed illegally. He said
he was unaware that the FDA had banned the patches already.
   ``I don't want my name out there,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Reagan wears one of the patches during the show, which features
testimonials of doctors and satisfied users, but he said he does
not use the patches.
   ``I auditioned as an actor and was hired to do the job,'' Reagan
was quoted as saying. ``It could have been baby bottles. I knew it
(the product) from nothing.''
   The product, called Eurotrym Diet Patches, is marketed by AmEuro
Services International Inc.
   Dr. Keith Kenyon, a San Fernando Valley doctor who said he
invented the patches about a year ago, confirmed the FDA
investigation.
   ``They wanted to know what was going on, because there was never
an application (for licensing) filed,'' he said.
   Officials with AmEuro, which markets the patches out of Phoenix,
Ariz., could not be reached for comment. There was no telephone
listing for the company in Phoenix.
   The patches contain a mix of natural substances, Kenyon said.
They are applied to an acupuncture point and stimulate the body, he
claimed.
   Similar diet patches marketed under the name Appetoff by
Meditrend International, a San Diego company, were seized in May by
the FDA.
   Nelson said it was unlikely Reagan would be a target of an
investigation unless he was involved in distribution or sales of
the alleged diet aid.
   In 1980 and 1981, Reagan was investigated for several business
dealings and was served with two search warrants, but the
investigation was later dropped. In 1981, he resigned from his job
after he used his father's name in a letter soliciting contracts
for his employer from military bases.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of scholars and writers from
around the world gathered in this university city Sunday as the
International Holocaust Conference on the impact of Nazi genocide
on the modern world.
   In an opening speech, Czechoslovak-born newspaper publisher
Robert Maxwell appealed to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to
``disclose the truth'' about Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat
who disappeared in Hungary while helping save thousands of Jews
from Nazi gas chanbers in 1944.
   Wallenberg was reported to have been seen in Soviet prison camps
12 years after the Soviets say he died in Moscow's Lubyanka prison
in 1947.
   ``It is only by remembering the past that we can guard against
its repetition in the future,'' said Maxwell, who is chairman of
the weeklong conference that has drawn more than 500 scholars and
writers from 48 countries.
   Maxwell broke down at the end of his speech and sobbed as he
said of the Holocaust: ``We must not let this happen again.''
   Most of Maxwell's family were were among the 6 million Jews who
died in the Holocaust. His wife, Dr. Elisabeth Maxwell, organized
the conference and on Sunday called upon people of all faiths to
join together to stamp out anti-Semitism. She is a Christian.
   During the closed session at Oxford and a public session in
London this Friday, the conference _ the first of its kind in
Britain _ will consider the impact of the Holocaust on the
contemporary world and the role of Christianity ``in creating a
climate of opinion that made it possible,'' the organizers said.
   Other events include a season of films in London and exhibitions
of some of the art produced by concentration camp victims.

   Two thousand people gathered at the
site of what had been a three-story department store Sunday night
to pay tribute to the victims, the survivors and the rescuers in
last week's building collapse.
   Workers cleared away the remaining rubble from the site Sunday,
the day after the last of the 14 bodies were recovered from the
debris left when the Amigo store fell down during a torrential
rainstorm Thursday.
   The crowd gave a standing ovation to Denise Carrera, the
8-year-old ``miracle child'' who was found virtually unscathed
under the debris Friday. The child, dressed in a blue dress,
clutched a candle as she came to the stage as a tribute to the
community's accomplishment.
   Brownsville Mayor Ygnacio Garza said the emergency was over and
thanked the hundreds of volunteers and authorities who assisted in
three days of rescue efforts.
   ``I think this community did and proved what all of us already
knew _ that we are a great city with great friends,'' Garza told
the audience. ``It now is time to bring this chapter to an end.''
   Many of the volunteers and local officials hugged each other and
the families of the victims as the ceremony came to an end.
   In all, at least 47 people were injured in the disaster, which
officials said may have been cause by the buildup of water on the
store's roof. Little Denise was one of six survivors pulled from
the rubble Friday. Her mother and 4-year-old brother were among
those killed.
   Garza, who coordinated the rescue effort, said investigations
into the collapse will begin this week. Another building might
never be built on the store site, he said.
   ``It's been suggested that a memorial plaza be erected on this
site,'' Garza said. ``I think this would be an excellent site for a
plaza. The idea strikes me very well, but with only six hours sleep
in the past three days, a lot of ideas strike me well.''
   Crews worked throughout the night Saturday, using heavy
machinery to remove remaining concrete and steel after they
determined no more survivors or bodies were in the rubble.
   Police Sgt. Dean Poos said the memorial service was intended to
thank the rescuers and other volunteers.
   ``A lot of the people will be going back to work Monday at 8
o'clock and this is just our way of saying `This is over,''' he
said.
   
   Poos said most of the cordoned-off streets near the site would
be opened early Monday, except for those within a block of the
collapsed building.
   Garza said he would speak with officials from the Federal
Emergency Management Agency to discuss emergency aid.
   He said concrete and steel trusses and other parts of the
building have been taken to insurance investigators, steel
manufacturers and city officials for analysis to determine the
cause of the accident.
   Officials believe a large pool of water collected on top of the
roof after more than 2 inches of rain fell in the area Thursday
afternoon.
   But Garza said there were numerous theories on the collapse,
including that roof drains were not clear. He said he would wait
for the investigation before placing blame.
   ``The insurance adjusters have taken some photographs, but their
job will be more difficult because everything has been
dismantled,'' Garza said.
   Officials had originally said 16 people died in the collapse,
but near the end of the search Saturday they found only one body in
an area where they had expected to find three.
   Residents across the Rio Grande Valley gathered in churches to
pray for the victims and families.
   ``People came from all over the Valley, from all over the state
to give their assistance and time,'' the Rev. Warren Brown told
about 500 worshippers at Immaculate Conception Cathedral, three
blocks from the accident site.
   ``There were people who may have never seen one another who came
to work together to save lives and comfort the bereaved,'' Brown
said.
   The mayor said he was thankful to hundreds of local volunteers
and especialy grateful to experts from across the country who
helped in the rescue effort.
   Most out-of-state experts, including seismic workers and
underground rescue teams, began heading home Sunday.

   Residents at Sunday church services
mourned family and friends killed in an oil rig disaster in the
North Sea and saluted the thousands of men working on other
offshore rigs.
   Roman Catholic Bishop Mario Conti read a message from Pope John
Paul II, who said he learned of Wednesday's explosion and fire
``with deep sorrow.''
   The disaster at the Piper Alpha rig 120 miles off Scotland's
east coast killed 166 workers. Fourteen of the 64 survivors were
still being treated in Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, three of them with
extensive burns.
   At the rig, Texas oil troubleshooter ``Red'' Adair and his crew
battled high winds Sunday in a fight to put out the blaze on what
remains of the platform. The fire was still burning early Monday.
   Conti urged 600 worshipers, included many black-clad mourners,
at a Requiem Mass to ensure that high safety standards are
maintained by oil companies ``and even bettered, and that no
unessential risks are taken, whatever the cost.''
   Tom O'Neill, 56, safety manager with the Odeco exploration firm
that discovered the Piper Oil field, spoke on behalf of oilmen to
those gathered in St. Mary's Cathedral.
   ``I ask you as an oilman to pray not only for the deceased and
the next-of-kin, but for all the living, and those who are out
there,'' he said.
   Conti said the enormity of the Piper Alpha disaster sent ``shock
waves well beyond our shores.''
   ``His Holiness (the pope) invokes eternal rest upon the
deceased, and God's comforting blessings upon the survivors and all
affected by the tragedy,'' Conti said, reading the pontiff's
message.
   But the bishop said the full impact of the world's worst
oilfield disaster was felt in Aberdeen and other parts of northeast
Scotland, where 40 percent of the victims lived.
   ``We have been, and are, proud of their achievements,'' he said.
``We mourn now their tragic deaths ... along with members of the
rescue parties.''
   ``They have worked for our benefit ... adding immeasurably to
the quality of our lives,'' he said.
   A memorial service for the victims is to be held July 20.
   The 73-year-old Adair was directing his firefighting team from
the support-vessel Tharos, alongside the disaster rig, said a
spokesman for Occidental Petroleum Corp., the rig's Los
Angeles-based owners.
   The crew boarded the rig at dawn Sunday, but was forced off by
bad weather and a surge of flames from one of its wells, said the
spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom.
   Divers and rescue crews will not be sent to search for the
bodies of the 149 missing men until after the debris is cleared and
Adair has capped leaking wells, Occidental executive John Brading
told a news conference Saturday.
   The Occidental spokesman said a small oil slick was reported
early Sunday, extending about 2 miles beyond the rig. Four
anti-pollution ships, equipped with spraying equipment, are
stationed near the platform, he said.

<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old who is trying become the world's
youngest transatlantic pilot had to postpone his dream Sunday when
a voltage regulator on his plane started acting up.
   Christopher Lee Marshall, who wants to emulate Charles
Lindbergh's 1927 flight to Paris, arrived in Montreal from New York
City on Saturday aboard his Mooney 252 two-seater.
   The young aviator from Oceana, Calif., was scheduled to fly to
Greenland Sunday, then stop in Iceland before arriving in Paris on
Wednesday. He began his trip Thursday in San Diego.
   But Chris' co-pilot, Randy (Duke) Cunningham, flew the plane to
Danbury, Conn., Sunday to have the voltage meter repaired. The two
hope to resume the flight Monday.
   Chris, who will be a fifth grader this fall, first took the
controls of a plane at age 4 and began flying with an instructor at
7. He is the son of a commercial pilot.
   Last year, Chris became the youngest pilot to cross the United
States. Tony Aliengena, a 9-year-old from San Juan Capistrano,
Calif., broke the record in April by making a
California-to-Massachusetts round trip.
   Cunningham, 46, a retired commander at Miramar Naval Air
Station, Calif., and a Vietnam war pilot, sits in the pilot's seat.
But he says Chris has done all the flying.
   Cunningham limits the boy's flying time to less than eight hours
at a stretch.
   Chris has said this trip will make him the world's youngest
transatlantic pilot. His next goal is to become the youngest pilot
to fly around the world.
   Lindbergh flew from San Diego to St. Louis, then to New York
City before completing his 33{-hour, non-stop solo flight across
the Atlantic Ocean to Paris in 1927.

   Firefighters on Sunday brought under control
a 17,000-acre forest fire that had burned within 3{ miles of Mount
Rushmore National Memorial and forced the evacuation of 1,000
people.
   Meanwhile, three wildfires in Southern California burned over
400 acres and caused $50,000 damage to a condominium but
authorities reported no injuries.
   The fire in South Dakota's Custer State Park, which was believed
to have been caused by lightning last Monday, was declared under
control at 6 p.m. Sunday, officials said.
   About 60 percent of the park was reopened earlier Sunday and
visitors began to return after crews contained the blaze's spread
the day before.
   All main roads in the park were to be reopened Monday morning,
said fire information officer Richard Homann.
   The blaze scorched the northern part of the 73,000-acre state
park and a small portion of the adjacent U.S. Forest Service land
that surrounds Mount Rushmore.
   Thirty-five firefighting crews of 20 persons each were sent home
Sunday, while two crews remained to assist in mop-up operations,
which are expected to take one to two weeks, Homann said.
   The fire was contained Saturday after thundershowers sprinkled
the area with about a quarter inch of rain, said fire information
officer Lynn Young. Lightning from the storms started nine
additional fires in the area, but local firefighters handled them,,
he said.
   ``It's enough to keep us a little nervous, but we haven't got a
big one going,'' Young said.
   ``We're just getting lots of phone calls. People just want to
get into the park, and we want them to do that as soon as it's
safe,'' Young said.
   In California, a wildfire charred 300 acres in the San
Bernardino National Forest Sunday, closing a 10-mile stretch of
Highway 74.
   About 250 firefighters surrounded the fire, which broke out late
in the morning and burned in a mountain area without any
structures, said Joanne Evans, a fire spokeswoman for the Riverside
County-California Department of Foresty.
   A separate brush fire broke out Sunday afternoon and burned 100
acres near the San Antonio Dam in Los Angeles County. About 100
county firefighters had the blaze 70 percent under control by
evening, said fireman Al Smith.
   A small brush fire in Newport Beach caused an estimated $50,000
damage to a condominium before firefighters brought the blaze under
control Sunday afternoon, said fire dispatcher Mary Ann Krumweide.

   Two men claimed victory and a third said he
was leading Sunday in the race to become Mexico's new president.
Opposition party activists blocked a major bridge and highways and
vowed to remain until the government released official results.
   It wasn't clear when the Federal Election Commission would give
the complete results of Wednesday's vote. The commission convened
Sunday to await results from district committees but did not
release any new results in the presidential race.
   The commission ``cannot rush out results until the (district)

   The Reagan administration is likely to
announce early this week that it will compensate the families of
those who died aboard Iran Air flight 655 and to highlight the
tragedy in a renewed campaign to end the Iran-Iraq war, senior
officials said Sunday.
   ``We want to do the right thing,'' said Michael Armacost, the

   President Reagan last Sunday expressed regret over the incident,
in which the USS Vincennes mistook an approaching Iranian A300

during his five years at the helm of nation's largest union, has
died. He was 61.
   Presser died Saturday night of cardiac arrest at suburban
Lakewood Hospital. He had undergone surgery for brain cancer in May.
   ``Mr. Presser's condition had deteriorated significantly over
the last few hours, and his cancer and previous cardiac condition
contributed to his death,'' Dr. Robert W. Reynolds, head of the
hospital's cardiac unit, said in a statement.

   Superpower talks on a treaty to cut U.S. and
Soviet long-range nuclear arsenals have come a long way, but
President Reagan's ``Star Wars'' program is one of two major
obstacles remaining, Moscow's chief arms negotiator said Sunday.
   ``We do not want to lose momentum,'' said envoy Alexei Obukhov,
who arrived here for the arms talks, which are to resume Tuesday
after a five-week recess for the Moscow summit.
   The United States and the Soviet Union have agreed to work
toward a treaty that would reduce by 50 percent their combined
long-range missiles over seven years, with each side limited to
6,000 nuclear warheads.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev brings
his message of reform to Poland on Monday in a visit the government
trusts will strengthen its own position and the opposition hopes
will lead to significant changes.
   The six-day visit will include a meeting of the leaders of the
seven Warsaw Pact countries. The State Department has reported that
the Soviets may be preparing to withdraw some troops from Hungary,
a member of the pact.
   Warsaw Pact leaders are meeting for the first time since the
U.S.-Soviet summit in Moscow and since Gorbachev's ``perestroika,''
or restructuring, was soundly endorsed by the 19th Soviet Communist
Party conference last month in Moscow.

   Vice President George Bush may have worked for
the Central Intelligence Agency in 1963, more than a decade before
becoming its director, according to a magazine article that cites a
recently discovered FBI memorandum.
   Bush denied the report through a spokesman.
   The Nation magazine, in its current issue, quotes a Federal
Bureau of Investigation memo of November 29, 1963, from
then-director J. Edgar Hoover to the State Department on the
subject of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

   The Detroit newspaper merger, the criminal
investigation of former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and
the Pentagon bribery probe are at the top of the Justice Department
agenda as Attorney General Edwin Meese III prepares to leave office.
   Meese, who is not participating in the Pentagon investigation
because his lawyers are representing clients involved in it, will
be gone from the Justice Department by the time federal prosecutors
are ready to seek indictments in the Pentagon investigation later
this year.
   But Meese has said through a spokesman he hopes to wrap up a
number of other loose ends before leaving in late July or early
August, including the question of whether the Detroit Free Press
and the Detroit News should be allowed to merge their advertising,
circulation and production operations under the Newspaper
Preservation Act.

   Farm Bloc strategists are pinning their hopes
for passage of a drought relief bill this summer on rapid action
combined with America's renowned soft spot for the family farmer.
   ``We are going to try desperately to get a consensus and avoid a
lot of bickering within the halls of Congress,'' North Dakota Gov.
George Sinner said as Farm Bloc leaders huddled last Thursday to
map strategy.
   Within a day, chairmen of both House and Senate Agriculture
committees declared that they would fashion a bill this week to
furnish relief for farmers whose crops have been scorched by
withering heat and lack of rainfall.

   Officials from the United States, South
Africa, Angola and Cuba will meet in New York on Monday to try to
reach agreement on principles for achieving a Cuban troop
withdrawal from Angola and black majority rule in Namibia.
   The meeting is the third in a series by the four countries, and
U.S. officials say that after an extended period of stagnation,
there are some hopeful signs that a settlement may be possible.
   One indication is that the Soviet Union, which has provided
Angola's Marxist government with billions of dollars in military
equipment since 1975, has shown interest in ending the conflict
there through a negotiated settlement, said the officials, who
spoke on condition that they not be identified.

   Combine the sales approaches of the Sears
catalog, a Tupperware party and the Avon lady, throw in frozen
ribs, cheesecake and other dishes and you have Sundborn Ltd.,
purveyor of home-delivered meals to time-starved consumers.
   Secaucus-based Sundborn, displays its culinary wares in a
catalog distributed at home food-tasting parties, and provides
delivery within 24 hours of upscale, frozen dishes _ the ribs go
for $28 and the cheesecake for $11.
   ``Gourmet food consultants'' host the tasting parties and give
catalogs to their friends and neighbors, collecting an average 12
percent commission on any orders. A customer's call to a toll-free
800 number brings dinner to the doorstep.
   Sundborn is ``an idea that grew out of my feeling that people
today had a poverty of time,'' said founder Richard LaMotta, who
also created the Chipwich ice cream sandwich.
   LaMotta thinks he found a market niche by combining the
attraction of home delivery and direct catalog sales.
   ``We're a substitute for going out to eat or getting pizza or
Chinese food,'' he said.
   The 170-item catalog features dishes gathered from regions and
restaurant menus around the nation, including cassoulet at $4.95,
Cajun catfish at $7.95, John Willingham's World Famous Ribs at $28
and Plaza Sweets Chocolate Velvet Boule at $15.
   LaMotta's food delivery idea is part of a nationwide trend,
industry experts say.
   ``I would guess that we're going to see more of these things,''
said Julie Mautner, an associate editor at Des Plaines, Ill.-based
Restaurant & Institutions magazine, a food-service trade
publication.
   She points to other companies emerging in the food delivery
field, such as General Mills' Order Inn division, which delivers
frozen dishes to three Minneapolis suburbs.
   Chicago-based Room Service arranges deliveries from area
restaurants to customers, and will even have tuxedo-clad waiters
set and clear the customer's table for an extra charge.
   Several chicken chains, including Popeye's and Kentucky Fried
Chicken, have experimented in home delivery, said William Trainer,
a restaurant analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York.
   ``People just don't have the time, but they want to eat well,''
said LaMotta _ well enough for Sundborn to sell about $250,000
worth of food in the past two months.
   One food industry colleague liked the idea, but was skeptical of
its merit.
   John Licari Jr., owner of Casa di Pizza in Bloomfield, said he
liked the idea but was skeptical of its merit.
   ``You're better off ordering a pizza,'' said Licari. ``It's got
everything there you need.''
   Nevertheless, Licari said his wife signed up as a Sundborn
consultant.
   ``I tried the food. It was pretty good. Me myself, personally,
I'd cook it, 'cause I'm in the business,'' he said.
   Sundborn, a subsidiary of Chipwich Inc., is losing money but
LaMotta hopes to see a profit and $30 million to $60 million in
sales within three years. It began delivery from its Totowa
distribution center in mid-April, two California franchises are
expected to open within two months and LaMotta said he plans to
have nationwide distribution within a year.
   Customers must buy a $50 minimum of the frozen goods _ which can
be heated in a conventional or microwave oven. The food can be
delivered in 24 hours within 50 miles of a distribution center or
in 48 hours outside of that radius.
   Sundborn's distribution centers are stocked by specialty food
manufacturers that generally supply restaurants, LaMotta said.
   Sundborn may sound like a yuppie service, but LaMotta rejects
the label. However, he concedes his clientele is not a
``coupon-clipping'' discount supermarket crowd.
   ``It goes beyond yuppies, though,'' he said. ``It really is the
ultimate busy person's food service.''

   The days of a man arriving home and
having his wife waiting with a home-cooked meal went out with
``Leave It To Beaver,'' says Anne Reznikoff, who is exploiting the
situation by selling take-home meals to home-bound commuters during
evening rush hours.
   Reznikoff, a New York marketing consultant, uses a refrigerated
van as her base at the Stamford train station for selling fresh
entrees that can be heated up in a microwave or conventional oven.
   The business, called ``Hi Honey, I'm Home,'' offers a choice of
three entrees nightly and has a total menu of 30 entrees ranging
from grilled salmon steak with vegetables to meat loaf with mashed
potatoes.
   Her target consumers are the thousands of metropolitan New York
commuters who pass through the station daily.
   Reznikoff says boredom with the typical takeout staples of pizza
and Chinese food helped inspire creation of the business.
   ``My husband and I would get home at 8:30 p.m., open the door
and jokingly say, `Hi honey, I'm home,''' Reznikoff said. ``But
instead of smelling a tasty dinner in the oven, we'd find an old
apple and a beer in the refrigerator.
   ``So, we'd call out for pizza, but there's only so much you can
take of that,'' she said.
   Reznikoff's diners have a choice of main dishes, side dishes
such as rice pilaf, cornbread or stir-fried vegetables, and salads.
Complete meals range in price from $7 to $9.
   The truck is parked at the Stamford train station from 4 p.m. to
8:30 p.m. Monday through Friday, to catch commuters coming home
from New York and those leaving Stamford offices to head into the
city. The company also delivers meals to offices in Stamford.
   Leftovers are donated to a Stamford shelter for troubled youths.
   Reznikoff said the business began operating about four weeks
ago, but she has been researching and planning it for a year.
Research included the surveying of more than 1,000 train commuters
about their eating habits.
   ``We found there are very few people who don't eat out at least
once a week,'' she said. ``And people don't want complicated food.
They want meat loaf and mashed potatoes.''
   Reznikoff and her husband, Stan Bratskeir, chairman of Rand
Public Relations Inc. in New York City, are the owners; they employ
an operations manager and a vendor.
   The meals are cooked by a kitchen staff of six in Norwalk that
is under contract to ``Hi Honey, I'm Home'' and other food services.
   Reznikoff described reaction to the truck so far as
``astounding.''
   ``We have people coming off the train, calling their spouse and
saying, `Here is what they have tonight,''' she said.
   Reznikoff said that during her first weeks in business the truck
was selling a maximum of 60 dinners per night. It is equipped to
serve up to 300 dinners nightly, she said.
   Reznikoff plans to open a truck at the Greenwich train station
by mid-summer. She eventually wants to have 30 trucks around the
New York metropolitan region. And she plans to start a lunch
service.
   ``There are two kinds of food,'' Reznikoff said. ``There's
homemade that takes a lot of time and is very good, and food that
is take-out that is convenient but not as satisfying.
   ``Our mission was to combine both and have convenient food that
tastes homemade.''

<HEAD>Company Expected To Sell Pictures Unit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures unit of
MGM-UA Communications Co. is expected to be sold along with its
famous lion logo to investor Kirk Kerkorian and another group, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
   Under the deal, investor Burt Sugarman and movie producers Jon
Peters and Peter Guber would acquire 25 percent of the pictures
unit, the Los Angeles Times said.
   Kerkorian, who owns an 82 percent stake in the unit's parent
MGM-UA, is expected to buy the balance of the pictures unit after
first offering shares of it to stockholders in the parent company,
the newspaper said.
   Other details of the deal were not reported and apparently still
were being worked out over the weekend. An announcement was
expected as early as Monday, the newspaper said.
   Lee Rich, chairman of MGM-UA, could not be reached for comment.
   MGM-UA, which produced the movie ``Moonstruck'' and the TV
series ``thirtysomething,'' had indicated previously it would
consider offers for all or part of the studio.
   The expected pictures unit sale apparently will include MGM's
famous Leo the Lion logo and its movie and TV production unit.
   MGM-UA shareholders apparently would continue controlling the
studio's United Artists unit and its 950-film library, which
includes the ``Rocky'' and ``Pink Panther'' films.
   Kerkorian reportedly had been asking about $200 million for the
MGM unit and about $1 billion for the whole company.
   Despite some successes, MGM has been plagued by losses which
amounted to $10.8 million for the nine months ended May 31. That
was down from $41.9 million in the same period a year earlier.
   MGM-UA stock closed at $15.75 a share on Friday, up 87{ cents in
New York Stock Exchange trading. Based on the company's 50 million
outstanding common shares, MGM-UA has a market value of $787.5
million.
   Sugarman became associated with Peters and Guber last year when
his Barris Industries merged with a private independent movie
production company owned by the two producers.
   Barris Industries, a TV production and syndication company, is
best known for ``The New Newlywed Game'' and ``The All New Dating
Game.''
   Guber and Peters' films include ``The Witches of Eastwick,''
with Jack Nicholson and ``The Color Purple,'' starring Whoopi
Goldberg.

<HEAD>GTECH Goes After Lottery Market In China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   GTECH Corp., the world's leading maker
of computerized lottery systems, has its eyes set on the world's
biggest market: China.
   The company is negotiating a contract to set up ticket-printing
plants in China, a deal that executives hope eventually leads to
the installation of an on-line lottery network similar to those
used in the United States.
   The winner of the contract to print tickets for China's handful
of paper lottery games could have the inside track on any future
projects, said Guy B. Snowden, GTECH chairman.
   ``One thing that I've found out about Asian philosophy and
Chinese culture in particular is that if you get going with them,
the relationships tend to be very long term,'' Snowden said.
   Iit has been known since last fall, when Chinese representatives
attended a lottery industry exposition, that the nation was
interested in a more sophisticated lottery.
   Lottery company executives say China's 1 billion population and
its increasingly consumerized society make it a tempting target.
   About a year ago, China introduced lotteries in a handful of
provinces. Buses drive to villages and sell tickets from a window _
tickets that GTECH hopes to win the contract to print.
   A computerized on-line lottery system like those in use in the
United States could follow, Snowden said. ``We want to provide them
an electronic bus,'' he said.
   China is the largest, but not the only, country where GTECH and
other lottery-system makers are seeking to expand.
   Lottery company executives estimate the world could easily
support 250,000 wagering terminals, yet only 60,000 have been
installed. In the United States, by contrast, the competition for
lottery contracts has dwindled; fewer states are starting lotteries
and most that already have them are under long-term contracts.
   GTECH reportedly is close to contracts in South Korea, Turkey,
Taiwan and West Germany, and runs on-line lotteries in Australia,
Canada, Iceland, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, Singapore,
Sweden and Venezuela, as well as in 10 American states.

<HEAD>Bally Sells Off Original Pinball, Video Manufacturing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bally Manufacturing Corp. is getting out of the
arcade machines business it created 57 years ago, selling its
pinball and video games business to concentrate on more lucrative
ventures, according to a company official.
   Bally, which produced such popular games as ``Pac-Man,'' ``Ms.
Pac-Man,'' ``Space Invaders'' and ``8-Ball Deluxe,'' will sell
assets from that part of its business for about $8 million to a
chief competitor, WMS Industries Inc., of New York, said William
Peltier, Bally vice president for corporate communications.
   Peltier said Saturday that the company probably will begin
making the Bally machines at a Chicago factory of its subsidiary,
Williams Electronics Games. He said the sale should go through
within 30 days.
   ``We started the pinball business in 1931,'' Peltier said. ``You
hate to see it pass, but you've got to keep moving.''
   Economic realities prompted Bally to make the move, Peltier
said. At its peak in 1982, Bally's amusement game business brought
in $600 million. By 1987, revenue from amusement game manufacturing
fell to $24.3 million in face of stiff competition from Japanese
firms.
   The company sold more than 100,000 ``Pac-Man'' machines, and
more than 125,000 ``Ms. Pac-Man'' machines, Peltier said.
   Bally has made its video and pinball machines at a factory in
suburban Franklin Park, which employs up to 200 people, Peltier
said.
   He said employees who do not move to the Williams factory in
Chicago probably will be absorbed by Bally's growing Lifecycle,
Liferower and Lifecircuit fitness equipment manufacturing
businesses.
   ``The fitness business, that's the growth business for us,''
Peltier said.
   Arcade machines helped give Bally its name, but also almost sank
the amusement giant.
   Bally grew out of a company called Lion Manufacturing Co., which
in 1931 introduced a pinball machine called ``Ballyhoo.''
Popularity of the game led the company to manufacture it under a
shortened version of the game's name, and the company went public
in 1968 as Bally Manufacturing.
   In the late 1970s and until 1982, Bally made millions of dollars
in the video game business. In 1982, Bally earned a record $91
million, and arcade games provided 75 percent of the company's
pre-tax profit.
   But one year later, Bally's profit was only $5.2 million after a
steep decline in the games' popularity. By 1984, Bally wrote off
$100 million in losses from its video game business.
   In the past two years, Bally has paid increasing attention to
its casinos in Las Vegas, Reno and Atlantic City.
   Bally will continue to manufacture gambling game machines, and
is keeping its Alladin's Castle chain of video and pinball arcades.
The company also operates 300 fitness centers nationwide, including
Chicago Health Clubs.
   In fiscal 1987, Williams' pinball sales were $76.5 million.

   Rain was scattered across sections of the Plains and upper Great
Lakes on Sunday, but not enough to cancel the drought, and one
Kentucky utility said stricter water conservation may be needed.
   Kentucky Gov. Wallace Wilkinson has called a special water
emergency meeting for Monday to discuss with local government
officials the severity of the drought and what action the state
plans to take.
   Showers and thunderstorms with mostly light rain were scattered
along a cold front that extended from the upper Great Lakes into
the central Plains early Sunday.
   Des Moines, Iowa, picked up 2.31 inches of rain in the 24 hours
up to 7 a.m., but that left the city still 7 inches below normal so
far this year, the National Weather Service said. Lansing in
northeasten Iowa got 3.85 inches.
   Parts of Kansas also got a fair amount of rain with 3.39 inches
in 24 hours at Madison, and 2.20 inches at Blue Rapids, the weather
service said.
   Up to three-quarters of an inch fell on parts of Kentucky during
the weekend.
   ``Every little bit helps, but what we need is a real soaking of
a couple of inches or more,'' weather service meteorologist Marilyn
Scholz said Sunday in Louisville. ``We need several of this kind of
(weather) system to really get us back ... and break the drought.''
   Rain also was scattered over parts of Michigan on Sunday, but
one corn and soybean farmer from the state's Thumb area wasn't
impressed. ``We're just getting a little spitting here and there, a
few raindrops on the road,'' said Gary O'Connor of Jeddo, about 10
miles northwest of Port Huron.
   Thunderstorms also spread from Michigan into Indiana and Ohio.
   Temperatures soared above 90 in the East, reaching 100 at
Washington and 98 at New York City, the weather service said.
Baltimore's airport hit a record 100 and Roanoke, Va., reached a
record 96. The record of 95 was tied at Buffalo, N.Y., for the
city's seventh straight record day.
   Above-90 readings had people flocking to the seaside in Boston,
according to a spokesman for a state agency that polices the
beaches. ``It's crowded, very crowded,'' said Metropolitan District
Commission police Sgt. Edward F. Stanley. ``There's no parking
available, and the people are all over each other.''
   Heat has combined with the drought in many areas to increase
demand for water.
   A ban on ``non-essential'' water use may be recommended this
week in Lexington, Ky., according to Robert Edens, vice president
and general manager with the Kentucky-American Water Co.
   On Friday the company pumped 45.9 million gallons of water, up
slightly from Thursday's 45.6 million gallons. The company has
targeted 44 million gallons as an acceptable rate of daily use.
   Despite the drought, entries in the livestock and crop shows at
the Ohio State Fair during Aug. 4-21 in Columbus are running close
to last year's record, said Jim D. Goard, the fair's director of
agriculture and livestock.
   ``I think people want to get away from home and forget their
problems. It gets depressing out there. Going to the fair lifts you
up,'' Goard said.
   The heat wave in the Midwest has raised the tempers of public
housing residents in Cleveland, and some residents of Cedar
Extension Estate challenged the Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing
Authority to provide air conditioners for health reasons or face a
rent strike.
   ``The Cedar building is filled with elderly, handicapped and
frail people whose health is being threatened by the hottest
weather in a half-century,'' said Frank J. Kidd Jr., president of
the Central Advisory Council, a group of tenant representatives.
   The drought also has heightened the danger of fires.
   In Michigan's north-central Lower Peninsula, about 200 residents
around Clear Lake had returned home Sunday after a fire in the Au
Sable State Forest consumed about 400 acres the day before, said
Cindy Hobart, a dispatcher with the Ogemaw County Sheriff's
Department.
