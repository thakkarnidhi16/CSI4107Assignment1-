   New England power officials warned on Sunday night
that blackouts may occur throughout the six-state region Monday
unless businesses and homeowners conserve electricity amid the heat
wave.
   A shutdown this weekend of the Maine Yankee nuclear power plant
and one of four power generators on Salem Harbor in Massachusetts
has worsened the already difficult power situation for most of New
England, officials said.
   The National Weather Service reported that 18 cities in the
northeastern quarter of the nation reported record high
temperatures for the date Sunday, and forecast that New England
would have 90s, with 80s in the northern portions, on Monday.
   Boston had an ironic record low temperature of 78 late Sunday
afternoon when an ocean breeze cooled the area. But as soon as the
winds shifted, the temperature shot up 14 degrees in 10 minutes,
the weather service said.
   Monday ``is definitely a very tight day,'' said Bill Sheperdson,
a spokesman for the New England Power Pool, which coordinates power
supplies for utilities throughout New England.
   ``If we don't get a considerable contribution by our customers,
as we did a number of days last week, we may not be able to provide
uninterrupted service,'' Sheperdson said.
   Boston Edison spokesman Michael Monahan called the situation
``tremendously tight'' and said the numbers simply don't add up for
power supply to continue without periodic, controlled blackouts
Monday.
   The New England region controlled by the New England Power Pool
set a record for summertime power demand last Thursday at 19,608
megawatts. The pool is expecting demand to exceed 19,900 megawatts
Monday.
   ``That's 300 megawatts more, plus you're missing Maine Yankee,
which is 860 megawatts,'' Monahan said.
   Maine Yankee shut down over the weekend because of a transformer
problem, according to Monahan. The pool is predicting the plant
will be out of service until Wednesday at the earliest.
   In New York City, meanwhile, Consolidated Edison reported a
record for Sunday electricity demand: 7,645 megawatts between 9
p.m. and 10 p.m., breaking the record of 6,770 megawatts, set last
Sunday. Spokesman Marty Gitten said peak demand often occurs at
that hour as people return home from weekend activities and turn on
air conditioners and lights.

   In the heart of this Roman Catholic city,
one of the latest bits of wall graffiti says ``Abortion Now,'' but
someone has blackened the telephone number.
   The graffiti in St. Stephen's Green is emblematic of an ongoing
clash _ but not over legalizing abortion. That's already banned in
the Irish Republic.
   The struggle is over a woman's right to receive information on
obtaining a legal abortion elsewhere.
   This country, with its 95 percent Catholic population, enshrined
an abortion ban into its constitution in 1983. Approved by a 2-1
margin in a national referendum, the amendment says a fetus and
mother have an equal right to life, which must be defended by the
state.
   Three months ago, the Supreme Court, ruling on action brought by
the country's main anti-abortion group, declared that the amendment
made it illegal for pregnancy counseling centers to provide women
with any information to help them get a legal abortion.
   However, university students across the republic have vowed to
continue publishing the names and telephone numbers of clinics in
England, where abortion is legal.
   ``Access to information is a civil liberty, and prevention of
such access is a form of censorship which we should not tolerate,''
said Tadhg Daly, president of the 120,000-member Union of Students
in Ireland.
   The Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child, the
plaintiff in the Supreme Court ruling, had sued two pregnancy
counseling centers for telling women how to get abortions in
England.
   Now it has now targeted University College Dublin, with 10,000
students the country's largest university.
   On July 1, the anti-abortion society's lawyers wrote to four
student leaders threatening legal acton unless they removed the
addresses of English abortion clinics from a manual given to
students at the start of each academic year.
   The school's student union president, Diarmuid Coogan, replied
that students had voted to include the abortion information and
said it will remain in the manual.
   ``All options should be available to women without pressure to
opt for one or the other,'' said Coogan.
   ``Does the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child intend
to put us in jail for implementing the democratically decided
mandate of our students?'' Coogan asked.
   All 40 colleges in the country back Coogan and four, including
Dublin's prestigious Trinity College, say they will publish the
same abortion information this fall.
   The national students' body has promised legal assistance to
fight attempts to stop publication.
   Maire Vernon, spokeswoman for the Society for the Protection of
the Unborn Child, said the group will wait to see if the
information is in this year's student manuals before deciding on
legal action.
   ``The right to life is written into the constitution, and it
overrides the right to information,'' Mrs. Vernon said. ``The right
to life is paramount. You don't have an untrammeled right to
information, especially if it is going to take the life of a
child.''
   Coogan retorted that the society wants ``to make abortion not
exist.''
   ``But thousands of Irish women go over to Britain every year for
abortions,'' he said. ``If women are going to have abortions, they
should have that information.''
   According to British government figures, 3,673 women living in
the Irish Republic received abortions in Britain in 1987, down from
3,918 in 1986. Mrs. Vernon said this was the lowest number since
1983, the year of the referendum.
   ``That means a lot of girls aren't even considering abortion but
are going ahead and having the baby,'' Mrs. Vernon said.
``Hopefully, it will continue to drop. But Britain is only 60 miles
off our coast, and we'll have to keep working away.''
   Pauline Ryder, clinic administrator of The Dublin Well Woman
Center, said the drop more likely stems in part from fewer Irish
women giving Irish addresses when they have British abortions
because of the controversy.
   The Well Woman clinic is one of two centers barred by the
Supreme Court from providing information on how to get abortions
after the suits by the anti-abortion society.
   The other center closed, and Ms. Ryder said Well Woman might be
forced to do the same because it has been ordered to pay the
anti-abortion society's $60,000 legal costs.
   While launching a fund-raising campaign, the center last month
resumed pregnancy counseling, limiting its discussion of abortion
to the operation, methods, care and cost, but not giving the
addresses of the English clinics.
   The center plans to appeal the Supreme Court ruling to the
European Court of Human Rights by Sept. 16 on grounds it violates
the right ``to seek, receive and impart information and ideas
through any media,'' which is guaranteed in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
   However, it's not clear a European Court ruling in favor of the
center would change national policy.
   Although legalizing abortion is not an issue, a survey released
last month by the Economic and Social Research Institute found 58
percent of the population favored abortion if pregnancy seriously
endangers a woman's life or health or results from rape or incest.

   About 15,000 animal trappers swapped tips
and admired everything from raccoon fur to alligator heads at a
national convention, while demonstrators Saturday marched with
signs reading, ``Every Fur Coat Hurts.''
   Some of the 200 animal rights activists marching outside the
Peoria Civic Center also carried signs with a picture of a mink,
reading ``This animal needs her mother. Is she on your back?''
   The activists say the trappers' use of steel leg-hold traps are
responsible for millions of painful animal deaths each year.
   ``Strong men protect and defend the innocent. Cowards trap,''
said Kay Sievers, who represented Trans-species Unlimited.
   ``It's time to ban this trap,'' Ms. Sievers said during a rally
in front of the Civic Center.
   ``You know why this is a great day? It's a great day because
we've got ourselves a winnable issue,'' said Victoria Moran of
Kansas City, Mo.
   The protesters collected signatures to use in their effort to
lobby Congress to ban leg-hold traps.
   The trappers, meeting this weekend for the National Trappers
Association's 29th annual convention, say they are misunderstood
animal lovers and blame animal rights activists for tarnishing
their image.
   ``We love animals,'' said Ray Petrunich, 50, of Taylor, Pa.,
owner of Trappers Specialty Products, a mail-order trapper supply
company. ``We have a great deal of respect for animals. We're
helping keep their numbers down and prevent overpopulation. There's
no logic to any of their claims.''
   On Friday, about 400 exhibitors displayed assorted animal skins
and the latest gizmos for catching wild critters.
   The parking lot outside resembled a giant tailgate party
featuring such delicacies as Louisiana red peppers, Wyoming coyote
and Florida alligator steaks.
   ``We cater gator,'' is the call from Ronald Braxton's booth. He
looks like a cross between Grizzly Adams and Crocodile Dundee as he
picks up the head of a 650-pound alligator he caught in his native
Florida.
   Braxton and his partner are licensed alligator control agents in
Westville, Fla., and are hired to capture the reptiles when they
pose a danger to humans.
   He uses their meat in his Gator Caterers business and sells
gator heads _ skeletons or preserved with skin and eyes _ at prices
ranging from $95 to $200.
   Inside the civic center exhibition hall, steel traps are
available by the thousands and wire snares are common. A small dirt
pond was built in one corner of the arena.
   An old-time trapper demonstrated the best way to conceal a small
leg-old trap and fielded questions from hundreds of conventioneers
on topics such as how to lure a beaver into a submerged trap.
   Others advertised their merchandise with videotaped in-the-field
demonstrations.
   David Naatz of Evansville, Wis., came to the convention to sell
Glaciers' Edge fox urine, at $12 a gallon, which he said is
essential for succesful trapping.
   ``You spread it around your trap to kill human odors,'' said
Naatz, who raises 200 foxes. ``It makes other animals think there's
been a fox nearby and is a good bait.''

   Concerns about violence and vandalism
dissipated Saturday as the opening of the controversial film ``The
Last Temptation of Christ'' passed with little trouble and more
moviegoers than protesters.
   The movie, which opened Friday in nine major cities in the
United States and Canada, has been denounced by Protestant
evangelists and conservative Catholics.
   Protesters contend that the portrayal of Jesus in the fictional
movie as a man with self-doubt and a temptation to give up his call
as a savior to live as a mortal is blasphemous.
   Security guards and police were searching purses and guarding
movie screens. There were reports of minor vandalism at the Century
Plaza Cinemas in the Los Angeles, and one arrest each in
Washington, D.C., and New York City.
   Police in Los Angeles said demonstrators have kept themselves
under control.
   ``We're handling it as a very, very low profile situation,''
Sgt. Rick Walker said Saturday. ``We have one supervisor keeping a
very casual eye on it.''
   Police officers had patrolled Friday in the theater complex,
which showed the film to near capacity crowds on two of its screens.
   Some movie patrons said the protesters were trying to infringe
on freedom of speech and religious tolerance, while others wondered
what all the fuss was about.
   The 800-seat Cinerama theater in Seattle had near capacity
crowds Friday night as about 300 people demonstrated outside the
theater.
   In San Francisco, the 900-seat Northpoint Theater sold out on
Friday 30 minutes after the doors opened for the first show amid
100 protesters and a small band of counterprotesters.
   Moviegoers in Washington D.C outnumbered demonstrators six to
one when the film opened at the Avalon Theater. People lined up
around the block as 75 demonstrators marched in a circle jeering at
those buying tickets. Officials reported that one person was
arrested for crossing a police line.
   The Cooper Theater in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Louis Park
was more than 75 percent full for its Friday evening showing of the
film as about 300 demonstrators held a peaceful prayer vigil
outside.
   The film's showing in Chicago was accompanied by protests from
Roman Catholics, Greek Orthodox, fundamentalists, Muslims, atheists
and one neo-Nazi.
   A total of 600 people turned out to demonstrate at the Biograph
Theater _ where gangster John Dillinger was gunned down more than a
half-century ago. All four shows at the 800-seat theater were sold
out Friday.
   In New York, four shows sold out at the Ziegfeld Theater, which
holds 1,144 people. Demonstrators, who sang, chanted and recited
the Lord's Prayer, numbered about 100 people at midday but the
crowd grew to between 500 and 1,000 by evening.
   One man who opposed the demonstrators was arrested for
disorderly conduct after getting into a scuffle.
   The movie also is playing in Toronto and Montreal. A Universal
spokesman said a decision has not yet been made whether to add
other cities next week.
   Movie chains refusing to book the film include the Newton,
Mass.-based General Cinema Theaters, the nation's fourth-largest
movie chain with 1,338 screens in 318 locations.
   Director Martin Scorsese has defended his film, pointing out it
is a work of fiction and is not based on the Gospels, and was not
made with blasphemous intent.

   Navy officials have recommended disciplinary
action against only one officer of the USS Vincennes in the downing
of an Iranian airliner July 3, the Washington Post reported in
Sunday's editions.
   The recommendation of the Navy board resulted from statements
following the panel's review of a report scheduled to be presented
to Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci this week.
   The report places most of the blame on the Aegis cruiser's
operations officer for his role in misinterpreting information
which resulted in the ship mistakenly shooting down the Airbus
killing all 299 aboard, the newspaper said.
   The report, currently being reviewed by Marine Gen. William J.
Crowe, Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recommends a
letter of reprimand to the officer to be included in his official
file. The officer's name had not been released.
   Earlier versions of the document, compiled by an investigative
team headed by Rear Adm. William N. Fogarty, said human error was a
major factor in the accident.

   Communist guerrillas released five
military officers in this sleepy village southeast of Manila on
Sunday after two months of captivity.
   About 50 communist guerrillas attacked another southern town two
days earlier, killing six people, the military said.
   Gregorio Rosal, spokesman of the New People's Army rebel unit
operating in Mamala, ceremonially unlocked the chains from the
prisoner's wrists at about 9:30 a.m. (9:30 p.m. EDT Saturday)
before about 170 journalists.
   The rebels kidnapped army Lts. Abraham Casis, Oscar Singson,
Clarito Santos, Rommel Salamanca and constabulary Sgt. John Jacob
on June 1 after raiding a poultry farm in Quezon province which
includes Mamala, 70 miles southeast of Manila.
   The five soldiers were released to Public Works and Highways
Secretary Juanito Ferrer, provincial officials and Roman Catholic
Bishop Julio Labayen after two weeks of negotiations which included
a temporary cease-fire that will end noon Tuesday.
   The rebels initially demanded the release of five alleged
communists in jail who are reportedly suffering from various
illnesses, but settled for their treatment in exchange for the
soldiers' freedom.
   Provincial officials also agreed to create a human rights task
force that will monitor alleged military abuses and compensate
victims, and make recruitment for vigilante groups voluntary in
compliance with the rebels' other demands.
   In another southern village, about 50 communist guerrillas
disguised as soldiers killed six people, the military said Saturday.
   Col. Cesar Fortuno, provincial army chief, told reporters the
insurgents attacked Friday in the mountain village of Tuburan in
Zamboanag del Norte province, about 10 miles southeast of Dipolog
and 460 miles south of Manila.
   He said the New People's Army raided the village of 200 people
two days after some residents enlisted with a group of
anti-communist forces in the area.

   Edward Bennett Williams, a famous criminal
lawyer and sports entrepreneur who thrived on victory and agonized
on defeat, died Saturday after a decade-long battle with cancer. He
was 68.
   Williams, owner of the Baltimore Orioles and former president
and part owner of the Washington Redskins, defended such figures as
Jimmy Hoffa, John Connally, Frank Costello, Richard Helms, Adam
Clayton Powell and Bobby Baker.
   Williams' customers also represented the Democratic National
Committee _ he served two years as the party's treasurer _ and The
Washington Post, the Ford Motor Co., and Gulf & Western.
   Born May 31, 1920, Williams won a scholarship at Holy Cross. He
joined the Army Air Force in World War II, but was medically
discharged after the crash of a training plane and enrolled at
Georgetown University Law School.
   ``I try to be guided by the ethics I was taught by the
Jesuits,'' Williams once said. ``A trial is like a war.''
   By his own account, Williams personally lost only one ``major''
case, the 1967 fraud and income tax evasion trial of Baker, an aide
to Lyndon B. Johnson. Williams went home with him, Baker said, and
burst into tears.

   Elmo R. Zumwalt III, son of the
admiral who ordered the spraying of Agent Orange in Vietnam and who
was exposed to the defoliant himself, died at his home Saturday
from cancer. He was 42.
   Zumwalt, who served in Vietnam from June 1969 to August 1970
commanding a patrol boat, said he never blamed his father for his
disease. The two co-wrote a book titled ``My Father, My Son,''
which was made into a television movie.
   Agent Orange contains highly toxic dioxin. Veterans had
contended that exposure to it causes cancer and other illnesses.
They said it caused miscarriages by wives of servicemen and birth
defects in their children.
   Zumwalt's son, Elmo Russell Zumwalt IV, suffers from a
congenital dysfunction that confuses his physical senses.
   The elder Zumwalt said he ordered Agent Orange sprayed over the
Mekong Delta to kill concealing vegetation. He commanded naval
forces in Vietnam from 1968-1970, then served as Chief of Naval
Operations until retiring in 1974.

   Otto E. Passman, whose 30 years in Congress
ended in an influence-peddling scandal involving Korean businessman
Tongsun Park, died of a heart attack Saturday. He was 88.
   Passman, a successful businessman, was first elected to Congress
from northeastern Louisiana in 1946. A conservative Democrat, he
chaired the House Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations
from 1954 to 1976, the year he lost a bid for a 16th term.
   A New York Times report said Passman was the largest beneficiary
of cash payments from Park, who was accused of buying influence in
Congress. The Times said Passman got $190,000 from Park.
   After leaving office, Passman was indicted on a variety of
federal charges in 1978 but was acquitted.

whose separate business and circulation departments are in the
process of becoming one, will each go up 5 cents, the Detroit Free
Press announced Sunday.
   The newsstand price of the Free Press will increase to 25 cents
from 20 cents, and The Detroit News will increase to 20 cents from
15 cents in six counties near Detroit and to 25 from 20 cents
elsewhere. The increases go into effect Friday.
   Increases had been expected after the decision by Attorney
General Edwin Meese III earlier this week to approve a joint
operating agreement between the two papers.
   The price of the combined weekend editions will be 25 cents on
Saturdays and $1 on Sunday. The first weekend of combined editions
is Aug. 20-21.

   A single-engine plane made an emergency
landing between two freeways in the Cincinnati area injuring the
pilot and his passenger and snarling traffic for hours.
   The plane clipped a guardrail, flipped and landed on its top in
a grassy area Saturday night after encountering engine trouble,
Sycamore-Montgomery Life Squad Chief Jim Buehler said.
   ``He was looking for a dark area to land in so he wouldn't have
to land on the interstate, instead he landed in a ravine between
them,'' Buehler said.
   Pilot Harvey Reis, 52, and passenger Michael Beck, 37, were
taken to Bethseda North Hospital. Beck was in good condition, but
Reis was still being evaluated early Sunday morning, spokeswoman
Joyce Miller said.
   Buehler said there were no other injuries.
   He said traffic was very heavy at the time of the accident and
it remained snarled for about three hours.

   Israeli troops fatally shot two Palestinians
and wounded nine Saturday in stone-throwing incidents in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, the army and hospital officials
said.
   The latest confrontation was Saturday night in a refugee camp
near the West Bank town of Jenin, where 18-year-old Yussef Mohammed
Damaj died of a gunshot wound to the chest, the Haaretz daily said.
   Soldiers opened fire as youths hurled rocks at the troops in a
clash that lasted several hours, the newspaper said.
   The army confirmed that a dead Palestinian was brought to a
nearby hospital after a clash at the camp, but a spokesman said
soldiers were investigating the cause of death.
   Damaj's death raised to 242 the number of Palestinians killed
since the uprising in Israeli-occupied territories began Dec. 8.
Four Israelis have also died.
   Another Palestinian, 52-year-old Mohammed Eid Abu Rizak, was
shot and killed earlier Saturday in the Gaza town of Rafah on the
Egyptian border, where Arabs hurled stones at troops during a
protest, hospital officials said.
   The Rafah demonstration was to protest the deaths of two Arab
workers in a fire last week at a construction site near Tel Aviv,
hospital officials said. Police have said the fire appeared to be
the work of arsonists but have refused to elaborate.
   The army confirmed the death in Rafah Saturday, saying troops
opened fire with live ammunition after trying to quell
stone-throwing protests by shooting tear gas and rubber bullets.
   Officials at Nasser hospital said a 15-year-old girl was among
the wounded.
   A clash also broke out at Nasser Hospital when protesters
gathered outside and began stoning troops, who responded with
gunfire. Five Palestinians were shot in the legs, hospital
officials said. The army said it had no reports of casualties.
   The army slapped curfews on four neighborhoods of Rafah, located
at the southern tip of the seaside Gaza Strip on the Egyptian
border.
   Soldiers also opened fire at protesters in the Tulkarm refugee
camp in the West Bank, wounding an 18-year-old in the leg, an
official at Al Ittihad hospital in Nablus said. The army said it
was investigating the report.
   In Hebron, 15 masked youths smashed every window in the
three-story town hall, Israel television reported. The attack was a
seen as a protest against Palestinians cooperating with the
military government, the television said.
   In Beitin, an Arab alleged to have collaborated with Israeli
authoriies started firing at an outlawed Palestinian flag hanging
from a telephone pole, officials at the Rafidiyeh and Ittihad
hospitals said. When villagers rushed at the man, he turned his
fire on them, wounding three, the officials said.
   An Arab reporter identified the alleged collaborator as Sadek
Bele from the village of Funduq, near Nablus. Israel radio said he
was a land dealer who was stoned by local villagers when he came to
Beitin. The man fled after opening fire, the radio said.
   The army had no comment on the incident and police spokesman
Yosef Fares said he was not authorized to discuss it.
   In another development, three Arab garbage collectors were
severely beaten by Jewish assailants while they worked in the Tel
Aviv suburb of Givat Shmuel, the Israeli-owned Itim news agency
reported.
   The assailants also attacked the Arabs' Jewish employer who
rushed to the aid of his workers and smashed the windows of his
truck, Itim said, adding that the attack was unprovoked.

   Machete-wielding men hacked to death
14 villagers, including three children, outside the central
Philippine city of Tacloban over a personal grudge, police said
Sunday.
   Maj. Gabriel Bardillon, Tacloban police chief, said only five
children survived the attack which occured shortly after midnight
Saturday in the mountainous village of Cabalawan, some 360 miles
southeast of Manila.
   He told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from
Tacloban that six assailants, some of them wearing masks, attacked
two families that lived in three shanties along an isolated and
abandoned golf course in Cabalawan.
   Maj. Bardillon said the killers' motive was apparently revenge,
adding that one of the survivors identified three of the killers as
enemies of some of the victims. He refused to elaborate.
   Police are still scouring the forests around the village for the
attackers who fled after the massacre, the police officer said.

   Radical students demanding unification
with North Korea battled riot police with firebombs and rocks
Sunday. Angry residents demonstrated to demand an end to the
violence.
   Protesters staged several attacks with firebombs to try and push
back thousands of police surrounding Yonsei University in the west
of Seoul.
   Troopers in green combat fatigues and black, visored helmets
fired volleys of tear gas and hurled rocks to drive students back
in the third day of clashes at the school.
   ``Advance nation unification'' and ``Yankees go home,'' students
chanted.
   Students tried to stage a number of demonstrations in downtown
Seoul, but the handfuls of protesters who showed up were dispersed
quickly by hundreds of riot police.
   Angry residents and shopkeepers staged several counter-protests
to demand students stop violent demonstrations. Some onlookers and
passersby heckled student demonstrations.
   Some 3,000 students were at Yonsei to prepare for a march Monday
to the border truce village of Panmunjom for talks with North
Korean student delegates on reuniting the divided Korean peninsula.
   The government banned the march and the students have virtually
no chance of getting past the heavy police cordon blocking them. A
similar attempt to march to the border June 10 was blocked by riot
police and turnouts at the latest protests have been smaller.
   About 42,000 U.S. troops are in South Korea under a treaty and
students contend Washington backs military rule in the country.
   The peninsula has been divided since 1945 at the end of World
War II. North Korea invaded the south in 1950 to start the Korean
War.

   Four train cars filled with

   The accident occurred after the passenger cars were decoupled
from a locomotive and accidentally rammed into the train they were

   Augsburg police spokesman Dieter Kuehle said 25 people were
treated at local hospitals. Three people were still in a hospital
but their injuries were not life-threatening, Kuehle said.
   German radio stations reported that more than 100 people were

   A USAir baggage handler who found $10,000 in a
bag at Greater Pittsburgh International Airport may end up with the
loot if the owner isn't found, police say.
   At least four people staked a claim for the cash, which was
found Aug. 5, they have been unable to convince police they are the
rightful owner.
   ``They've been people who honestly believed the money could be
theirs,'' said Allegheny County Police Sgt. Diane Pilkington. ``But
they were grasping at straws.''
   The claimants reported either losing large sums of money or
having cash stolen recently.
   Police ask those who try to claim the money to describe the
bills in terms of denominations and, if possible, serial numbers.
They also ask them to pinpoint where the cash was lost and how it
was packaged.
   It was unclear when police would call off their search for the
owner of the money.

<HEAD>In Recent Past, When Gambling Was Illegal ... But Was Taxed Anyway</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT CHARTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not very long ago, this resort spa's
illegal gambling was hotter than its much-touted healing spring
water, so much so that local government winked and even reaped tax
revenue rather than stop it.
   Throngs of tourists and townspeople took chances, in violation
of state law, on at least 350 slot machines, card games, bingo and
bookmaking.
   Police looked the other way, except to collect the municipal
``amusement'' tax, until 1967, when a state crackdown during the
administration of the late Gov. Winthrop Rockefeller scrapped tons
of betting devices.
   ``It was probably the only illegal tax in this country collected
by a city,'' recalls state Sen. Eugene ``Bud'' Canada, who was
Garland County sheriff in 1967 but wasn't invited to join state
agents who raided the casinos.
   ``They built a city auditorium, where the Miss Arkansas Pageant
is held _ a beautiful place _ and a city hall, and the main
firehouse downtown, all on an illegal tax,'' he says.
   Dusty tax records show the city levied $10 monthly for each slot
machine.
   The Baxter Hotel, Butler's Barbecue, Harlem Chicken Shack and
the Eatmore Cafe had one slot each. More adventurous were the J.D.
Jackson Fish Market, VFW Club and Hot Springs Country Club, with
two slots apiece.
   The best bet at Coy's Steak House these days might be the
fork-tender prime cuts, but in 1967 diners waiting for a table
could play eight slot machines.
   Tax rates ran $100 a month for bingo and cards, $500 for large
casinos _ those with more than five gaming tables _ and $300 for
small casinos. The casinos included places like the Ohio Club,
Southern Club and The Vapors.
   Tax rates were raised in 1964, but the Elks Club refused to pay
the difference. Records show club officials sent payments on their
five slots at the old rate until the state raids in early fall 1967.
   ``The cornerstone of public morality is respect for the law,''
Rockefeller declared that year in hiring former FBI agent Lynn A.
Davis to be state police chief.
   Davis says he told Rockefeller he wanted to concentrate on law
enforcement, not politics, and specifically on closing casinos. He
says Rockefeller ``slapped his knee and said `That's exactly what I
want.'''
   Early on Aug. 17, 1967, Davis and about two dozen officers
converged on the downtown Bridge Street Club.
   It was after normal business hours and the door was locked. The
owner was summoned, according to newspaper accounts. When he didn't
show after an hour, Davis broke a glass panel in the door with a
tire iron, in front of photographers, and troopers knocked in the
door.
   Two days later, the Arkansas Gazette editorialized: ``Davis has
given the state the most convincing demonstration yet of how the
state can break the back of the notorious Hot Springs gambling
operation, which has been a scandal of historic, but nonetheless
disgraceful dimension ... he was following his responsibility to
the law where local enforcement had defaulted.''
   Canada cried foul. ``I'm really incensed,'' the sheriff told
reporters. He complained about the lack of notice to local lawmen,
``especially those who have to be elected and must answer to the
people.''
   Davis responded 21 years later: ``The Bridge Street Club, the
Ohio Club and all of the other clubs could be found by tourists who
went to Hot Springs. They could have been found by a blind man. And
if the sheriff didn't know they were there, then I was afraid to
take him with me on a raid.''
   Canada attributes the friction to politics.
   ``You had a brand-new Republican governor, and you had a
brand-new Democratic sheriff,'' he says.
   Proposals to legalize casino gambling fell twice to voter
rejection, in 1964 and in 1984, and once to Rockefeller's veto, in
1967.

<HEAD>Infant Slaughter-Organ Transplant Rumors Frustrate Officials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials are frustrated by persistent
reports _ some blamed on Soviet disinformation _ that Latin
American children are being butchered for organ transplants in the
United States.
   The reports have been crisscrossing the globe for the past 20
months, confounding U.S. officials who have been trying to locate
their genesis, track their progress and provide credible denials.
   The latest report surfaced last week in Paraguay, after police
raided a house and found seven infants and several pregnant women
who apparently planned to give their babies up for adoption.
   A juvenile judge, Angel Campos, said that while he had no proof,
he believed some of the babies might be dismembered in the United
States for their organs, which could then be sold for hundreds of
dollars.
   The story, circulated by a respected news agency, has been
making the rounds of the world press this week despite adamant
denials from the U.S. Embassy in Asuncion.
   The U.S. Information Agency has concluded that all the reports
are based on unsubstantiated rumors which began in Honduras. Its
yearlong investigation _ aided by the FBI, the Department of Health
and Human Services and other agencies _ has failed to find any
proof of the charges.
   ``The original misinformation would not have spread so far and
wide if it had not been for the way it was cynically used and
embellished with deliberate distortions in a disinformation
campaign by several communist countries, with the Soviet Union and
Cuba taking the lead,'' according to a report on Soviet
disinformation prepared by USIA for Congress.
   The United Network for Organ Sharing, which oversees organ
transplants in the United States, has also denied the charges.
   ``It's very frustrating when you don't know who's spreading such
rumors,'' said Kelle Straw, a spokeswoman for the non-profit
organization, which receives some of its funds from the government.
   Ms. Straw said the United Network had never found any leads to
follow in its own investigation of the reports.
   ``And anyway, it's ridiculous,'' she said. ``Children don't make
good donors; their organs aren't fully developed.''
   In its report to Congress, the U.S. Information Agency cited
dozens of other such reports which have surfaced in places as
diverse as Bangladesh and Morocco, some in Communist Party
newspapers and others in independent publications.
   ``The rumor is gruesome enough so that it would feed on itself
without any help,'' said Todd Leventhal, an agency official who
prepared the report and has been monitoring the ``baby parts'' case
as it is known in the government.
   ``But because the Soviets are involved, we're seeing more of
these reports and with more of an anti-American slant,'' he added.
   Latin America, where thousands of babies are adopted by
foreigners every year, is a fertile ground for breeding such rumors.
   In its report to Congress, the USIA concluded it is sometimes
hard to tell which of the baby parts allegations are ``due to
misinformation and which is due to disinformation.''
   But Leventhal said disinformation experts in the United States
can tell whether the Soviets are behind a certain report according
to the newspapers carrying such a story and the slant that it takes.
   In some cases, the Soviet role is quite obvious, he said.
   On July 25, 1987, the official Soviet newspaper Izvestia
reported that an international Mafia brings up disabled children in
Guatemala and sends them to the United States. ``There, the butcher
medics cut out their hearts, kidneys and eyes,'' the Izvestia
report said.
   The newspaper cited officials of the Geneva-based Defense for
Children, International, as the source of its information. The
organization accused Izvestia of turning out ``a veritable
masterpiece: an astute mix of quotes taken out of context,
journalistic comment, established fact and unfounded allegations.''
   The course of the baby parts story constitutes a fascinating
study in the life of a rumor.
   The USIA has traced the original report to Leonardo Villeda
Bermudez, formerly Honduras' top social welfare official. Bermudez
was quoted as saying in January 1987 that he was told by some
social workers several years previously about people seeking to
adopt disabled children so they could sell them ``for parts'' in
the United States.
   His comments were circulated worldwide by a respected news
agency, lending them sufficient credibility and exposure so that
they have been cited repeatedly since then despite his retraction
the day after his remarks were reported.
   In his retraction, Bermudez said ``he confused a simple rumor''
with facts. Other Honduran officials denied there was any proof of
such practices.
   But more than a year later, his comments were still circulating,
and were quoted _ among other places _ in the Venezuelan newspaper
El Nacional.
   ``It just won't die. Just when we think we've managed to get rid
of it, it pops up again,'' said Leventhal.

<TEXT>
   From tiny vials of ``Elvis Presley's
sweat'' to plans to bury Hank Williams' in the toe of a huge cowboy
boot, some Southerners ain't been whittling Dixie's icons from
slabs of good taste, a trained observer says.
   The greater the fame of the heroes, the more apt you are to find
tacky items and stories twisting up around their memory like
tendrils of the kudzu vine, said Charles Wilson, a professor of
history and Southern studies at the University of Mississippi.
   Wilson, a native Texan, has become a self-appointed keeper of
what he calls the ``Southern Tacky Collection.''
   Many people would say his campus office is cluttered with junk,
but he views it as a display of ``material artifacts'' dating to
1950.
   ``This is sort of the wall of Southern culture. All sorts of
posters with post cards, pictures, images of the South. Post cards
often portray these icons of the South,'' Wilson said, motioning to
hundreds of cards papering his office wall and sitting in stacks on
his desk.
   ``This one is my all-time favorite. ... It has a small vial of
Elvis' sweat. `The King lives. His perspiration will be your
inspiration,' it says.
   ``Here's Presley's Cadillac. This is a real icon. There's all
kinds of stories about Presley driving around in his Cadillac. He
gave Cadillacs as gifts.''
   Though prized, nothing in Wilson's collection is priceless.
Rather, they are generally cheap.
   ``These are not necessarily things that stand out for uniqueness
but things that are representative,'' he said. ``They are such
simple items; they're not the kind of things anybody saves.''
   Every region has its mass-produced tacky items, but Wilson
contends some pieces are ``uniquely Southern.''
   ``A lot of the things I collect are symbols,'' he said. ``A
cotton bale for example. In Mississippi if you go to Stuckey's or
various stores they sell little cotton bales as souvenirs as a
symbol of the South. That's marketing a symbol of the South.''
   Other miscellaneous tacky stuff in the collection ranges from
pop-up cardboard antebellum homes to a stuffed armadillo and
plastic cows that moo when their heads are twisted.
   A big category in his collection is fans, primarily stamped with
images of a happy family or pastoral theme. Wilson said funeral
homes most often produced and gave away the fans, which were used
extensively before air-conditioning.
   Another favorite item is an inexpensive clock with wooden
extensions on the sides. Photographs, apparently torn from
magazines, of Martin Luther King Jr. and his wife, Coretta, and
President John Kennedy and Sen. Robert Kennedy are glued on each
side.
   ``It looks almost like an icon in a Catholic church in Europe or
something, with wooden panels and then the Saints,'' Wilson said.
   His collection also includes advertisements and wrappers from
Southern sweets like Goo Goo Clusters and Moon Pies.
   Another facet of his work examines Southern ``yard art'' like
plastic pink flamingos. ``Exactly when and how it developed, I'm
still trying to find out. But you don't find this in places other
than the South,'' he said.
   Wilson also collects tacky tales of the modern South.
   His favorite is a proposal by some members of the Montgomery,
Ala., City Council, shortly after the death of country singer Hank
Williams in 1953, to construct a monument to him in the shape of a
cowboy boot.
   ``It was going to be a huge, towering monument with his body
buried in the toe part,'' Wilson chuckled. ``It was a pretty wild
idea all right. The City Council in Montgomery actually debated
it.''
   The idea eventually was tossed out.

   Communist guerrillas released four
army officers and an enlisted man in this coconut farming village
Sunday after holding them hostage in the mountains for more than
two months.
   In another development, machete-wielding assailants hacked to
death 14 villagers, including three children, near the central city
of Tacloban, police said.
   Gregorio Rosal, spokesman for the communist New People's Army,
unlocked the chains from the five prisoners' wrists in front of 170
journalists, relatives and officials waiting near a coconut grove.
   On June 1, the rebels captured Lts. Abraham Casis, Oscar
Singson, Clarito Santos and Rommel Salamanca and constabulatory
Sgt. John Jacob in this village about 70 miles southeast of Manila
in Quezon province.
   The five men, dressed in civilian clothes, were driving toward
Manila when they were abducted by rebels they thought were
government troops, according to Col. Hernani Figueroa, a military
spokesman. Rebels often wear uniforms similar to army fatigues.
   The military and the rebels agreed to a temporary cease-fire
that ends at noon Tuesday.
   Provincial officials in Quezon assured the rebels they will not
force people to join government paramilitary units. Authorities
also agreed to create a committee to investigate alleged human
rights abuses by government soldiers and to pay damages to victims.
   Twelve suspected communists, including a 71-year-old woman, were
arrested in a raid in Kilawis village on the outskirts of Manila,
according to Sgt. Romeo Artajos.
   Firearms and documents were seized along with the suspects, who
were accused of recruiting members for the communist insurgency,
Artajos said.
   The official Philippine News Agency said the military on the
central island of Negros detained five suspected rebels in
connection with the slaying of an Australian businessmen in the
province on Monday.
   The police chief in Tacloban, Maj. Gabriel Bardillon, said six
assailants, some wearing masks, attacked members of two families
living in shanties along an abandoned golf course in the village of
Cabalawan, about 350 miles southeast of Manila.
   Maj. Bardillon said only five children survived the massacre
shortly after midnight Saturday and that police were searching for
the attackers in the forests around the village.
   He said the motive for the attack apparently was revenge over a
personal grudge and that one of the survivors identified three of
the killers as enemies of some of the victims.

   A bus collided head-on with a truck
carrying beehives, and 15 people were reported killed and 24
injured. A news agency said bees escaping from the damaged truck
hampered the rescue effort.
   The accident occurred near Gurlek village when the bus rammed
the back of one truck, then collided head-on with the truck loaded
with bees, the semi-official Anatolia news agency said.
   It said 10 people died at the scene and that five at Denizli
state hospital. Of the 24 injured people, 13 were hurt seriously,
the agency said.
   The bees coming out of the shattered hives slowed the rescue
operation, and the Denizli-Afyon highway was closed to traffic for
2{ hours.

<TEXT>
   A family tried to compensate the
relatives of a man who was killed by turning over money, livestock
and their 6-year-old daughter, but police intervened to stop the
deal, it was reported Sunday.
   The compensation agreement was made between two families living
near the town of Murehwa, 50 miles northeast of Harare, the Sunday
Mail said.
   The newspaper said police ordered the family blamed for the
slaying of villager Cyprian Nhamburo to exclude the child from the
compensation deal.
   Nhamburo's relatives also demanded $1,620, 11 cattle and three
goats from the family of a man they allege killed Nhamburo two
weeks ago, the Sunday Mail said. That part of the deal was allowed.
   In Zimbabwe, relatives often claim compensation for family
deaths, but this was the first reported case involving a child in
the transaction.
   The Zimbabwe Child Protection Society condemned the deal as
``tantamount to slave trading'' and said it would take legal action
to ban tribal practices it said ``reduce a human being to the level
of a commodity exchange.''

   A pharmacist was kidnapped by three
masked gunmen as he was driving home early Sunday with a
girlfriend, police said.
   Michelangelo Mundula, 27, who works in his father's pharmacy in
Dorgali near Nuoro on Sardinia's northeast coast, was abducted
shortly after midnight by two men with pistols and a third man
armed with an automatic rifle.
   Police said the men forced Mundula and his girlfriend out of the
car, tied them up and then drove off with the two in the backseat.
The kidnappers abandoned the car, with the woman still inside, a
few miles away and fled on foot into the hills with Mundula.
   The woman managed to free herself a few hours later and alerted
police.
   It was the latest in a series of kidnappings in Italy.
   Last week, the kidnappers of Roman builder Giulio De Angelis
sent a piece of the hostage's ear to his family along with a ransom
demand of $2.5 million.
   De Angelis was kidnapped June 12 from his home in Porto Cervo on
Sardinia's exclusive Costa Smeralda. Sardinia is an Italian island
south of Corsica.

   George Bush is playing the vice president
gambit for everything it's worth, which isn't very much. But then,
it's the only bit of show business available this week at the
Republican National Convention.
   His orchestrated surprise will be good theater for a few hours
in New Orleans. And, obviously, the Republican presidential
nominee's choice of a running mate is a crucial decision in the GOP
bid to keep the White House.
   But nobody is going to remember the theatrics once they are done.
   The Bush plan is to announce the selection on Thursday morning,
with tight secrecy until then. Campaign manager Lee Atwater said
there'll be ``as much drama as we can have,'' the better to boost
interest and television ratings.
   ``I'm for doing anything that will help build up a TV
audience,'' Atwater said.
   ``There won't be any leaks of this one because I'm not gonna
tell a soul,'' said Bush.
   Some souls may think there are clues, however. Take Gov. James
R. Thompson of Illinois, who telephoned Bush on Friday and asked
not be considered for second spot on the ticket.
   Such requests often come from people who figure they aren't
going to be chosen anyhow.
   Having been there, Bush knows the way the game is played. For
Bush, there was a hotel suite across the street from the Detroit
convention hall in which President Reagan was nominated in 1980.
   Bush, a defeated rival for the Republican nomination that year,
waited out a very long night of speculation that former President
Gerald R. Ford would be the vice presidential nominee on the Reagan
ticket. It was going on midnight when that deal fell apart, and
Reagan turned to Bush. A quick telephone call, a quick acceptance,
a joint appearance before the convention to quell the chaos and
introduce the running mate.
   Now it is Bush's turn to issue the summons. His presidential
nomination is set, the vice presidency is the only unfilled role.
   Actually, what he is doing is choosing his candidate the
old-fashioned way. Until relatively recent conventions,
presidential nominees observed strict vows of silence on the vice
presidency until after their own nominations. Advance discussion
was presumptuous, gauche.
   On Wednesday night of convention week, after the roll call that
delivered the nomination, the presidential nominee would summon his
high command into late-night session to settle on No. 2. Prospects
would come and go from the candidate's suite.
   In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson chose Sen. Hubert H.
Humphrey for his ticket, but summoned Connecticut Sen. Thomas J.
Dodd, too, just to keep people guessing.
   Latter-day candidates have taken to listing prospects in advance
and, in some cases, to conducting pre-convention job interviews.
They send out questionnaires, they look at fitness reports.
   That practice took on some urgency after the 1972 Democratic
convention, at which nominee George McGovern chose Sen. Thomas
Eagleton to run with him, and learned after the fact that Eagleton
had been hospitalized for nervous exhaustion and fatigue, and had
undergone electric shock treatments.
   R. Sargent Shriver replaced him on the ticket, which went down
in flames, and presidential nominees have tended to conduct more
thorough advance checks on prospective running mates ever since.
   In 1976, Jimmy Carter interviewed seven prospects, then chose
Walter F. Mondale for vice president. When his turn came, Mondale
conducted a similar set of pre-convention auditions and chose Rep.
Geraldine Ferraro.
   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis interviewed a
half-dozen prospects, then chose Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen a week
before the national convention that nominated that ticket in
Atlanta.
   In the Bush selection game, a dozen names have floated into
speculation encouraged by campaign stage managers.
   Two governors, Thompson of Illinois and Gov. George Deukmejian
of California said they do not want to be considered, as did Sens.
Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas and William Armstrong of Colorado. ``I
would be a liability,'' protests Sen. Al Simpson of Wyoming.
   Thompson cited family concerns. He said he'd have to travel too
much, and his wife couldn't come because they have a 10-year-old in
school.
   At face value, that would make him the first politician to
shrink from seeking national office for want of a sitter.
   If they won't run, others will. Rep. Jack Kemp of New York said
he'd be glad to accept. Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana said it would be
an honor. Sen. Pete Domenici said he wasn't too proud to campaign a
little for it. Howard Baker says he doesn't want the job, but it
would be arrogant to turn it down.
   Mark them down for honest men. The fact of the matter is that
there aren't many Republican politicians who would say no if asked.

<HEAD>Superman And At Least Four Chinese Films Stopped</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading newspaper on Sunday criticized
officials for banning ``Superman'' and at least four Chinese films
that passed the censors and opened to packed movie houses.
   In a rare plea from the official press, the China Youth News
called for measures to prevent such ``lawlessness.''
   The report said ``Superman'' was one of at least five movies
banned in the capital since 1985. It said unidentified officials
decided the films were unfit for the masses.
   The officials had showings of ``Superman'' halted in early 1986
because they said the movie ``turned the world upside down'' and
``reversed the flow of time,'' according to the report.
   The officials did not want China's ``youth to be inculcated with
the film's impossible idealism,'' the report said.
   In the 1978 movie, Superman rescues Lois Lane from death in an
earthquake by circling the earth at the speed of light and
reversing time.
   Two of the other films that were banned in Beijing, ``The Fierce
Battle in Taierzhuang'' and ``The Beach'' have won awards in China.
   The controversial ``Taierzhuang'' depicts a battle between the
Kuomintang, archrival to the Communist Party, and Japanese invaders
in 1938.
   In the movie, the Kuomintang, who were forced out of China in
1949 and now occupy Taiwan, are depicted as patriotic and even
heroic, an image which clashes sharply with the one created by the
Communist government.
   The report said that in April 1987 when ``Taierzhuang'' was
playing across the nation, officials closed the film in Beijing.
After eight months of agitation in the movie industry, the report
said, the government let the film show in Beijing, but only for six
months and no advertising was allowed.
   At the end of 1985, the report said, ``The Beach,'' a explicit
love story, was suddenly pulled from Beijing movie theaters even
after official censors approved it. The paper said ``certain
leaders thought the plot would have a bad affect on society.''
   In the film, a woman is forced by her family into an arranged
marriage. The scene of her wedding night portrays the tribulations
of an unwilling bride in bed with her husband.
   The paper said that in many cases, the officials banning the
films had no relation to the Ministry of Culture, which is
responsible for censorship. It did not say what department of
government the officials were from.
   The report also said that since 1984 Beijing has only allowed
two copies each of popular martial arts movies to circulate in the
capital's movie theaters, while other cities had 10 copies.
   ``This regulation might be a good one in order to limit the
influence these movies have one young people,'' the paper said.
``But because there's no law to follow, who knows whether it's
true.''
   The report said banning movies after they have already been
released has cost Beijing's theaters thousands of dollars. It also
said officials who like unpopular movies have forced city film
officials to order more copies of them, causing further losses.
   The report called for a law that would set clear regulations on
the content of movies to counteract official capriciousness.
   A recent issue of Outlook magazine said officials at the
Ministry of Culture are studying a proposed law setting censorship
guidelines for movies.
   Among the topics being debated, the magazine said, is whether
naked bodies or serious crimes should be depicted on China's silver
screen.
   The proposal would mark the first time since Communist China was
established in 1949 that explicit standards have been set about
what can and cannot be included in a Chinese movie.

   Rep. Kenneth J. Gray, a frizzy-haired,
bow-tied magician who is retiring after 24 years in Congress, wants
to be remembered as the Prince of Pork who brought billions in
federal projects to his depressed district.
   But he's still trying to live down a reputation as the man who
brought Elizabeth Ray to Washington.
   ``It's a bum rap,'' Gray says of allegations that he had a
personal relationship with Miss Ray, the ``I-can't-type'' secretary
who claimed she was on a committee payroll only to provide sex for
the chairman, then-Rep. Wayne Hays, D-Ohio.
   ``I hired her in 1972, fired her in '73 and she didn't even meet
Wayne Hays until 1976,'' said Gray, an Illinois Democrat. ``I never
had anything to do with Elizabeth Ray personally. I'm no angel and
don't profess to be. People can say lots of things about me, and
they do, but that's one thing I was not guilty of.''
   Gray, 63, is guilty of wearing loud clothes, driving big cars
and delivering by his own estimate about $7 billion worth of
federal projects to his coal-mining district in southern Illinois.
   ``I've always been called the Prince of Pork, and I wear that
label proudly,'' Gray said. ``It means we got 500 miles of
Interstate highway, modern concrete roads, water and sewer and
lights _ all things we needed in southern Illinois. We tried to
build the infrastructure needed for local communities to pull
themselves up by their bootstraps.''
   Citing poor health, he announced last November that he will
retire at year end after 12 terms that spanned 34 years.
   ``It was one of the most difficult decisions I've ever made,''
he said. ``To walk away from this kind of power, which gives you
the vehicle to help other people, is a tremendously regretful
situation.''
   Gray has served on the Public Works Committee during his tenure
and wields considerable clout through his seniority and friendship
with the Democratic leadership, particularly with House Speaker Jim
Wright.
   Wright, who often assigns Gray to preside over the House,
cautions against judging Gray by his flamboyant dress and jocular
nature.
   ``The more you know him,'' Wright says, ``the more convinced you
become of his having a first-rate mind, a sincere purpose and the
capacity to perform effectively.''
   Gray said his retirement plans are sketchy at the moment. ``I've
got a motor home, and I want to putter around the United States and
see a lot of places I haven't been,'' he said. ``But who knows? I
may get tired of it and want to get back into government.
   ``One thing is definite. I intend to become very active in
feeding children and hungry people.''
   A coal miner's son and amateur magician who spent his early
years as a car dealer, airport operator and auctioneer, Gray became
known for showmanship and his down-home style when he arrived in
Washington.
   He often used magic tricks to illustrate his speeches, which he
peppered with such folksy phrases as: ``When I meet somebody, I
shake their hand twice'' and ``times are so bad down in southern
Illinois that the creeks are only running three days a week.''
   Gray also developed an image that haunts him today: a reputation
for flashy clothes, fancy cars and late-night parties.
   Velvet suits have given way to double-breasted sport coats and
bow ties, and Gray describes his lifestyle as quiet today _ an
impression shared by friends.
   ``It could be said we all mellow with age,'' said House Minority
Leader Robert Michel, a Republican from Peoria, Ill. ``He is a
different person, although Ken was always a very popular figure
even during his early days.''
   ``I'd like to be remembered for helping people with all those
things,'' Gray said. ``But I'll be happy if they just remember me.''

   Republicans are carefully orchestrating their
convention to emphasize a different message each day for George
Bush and insisting that their gathering will be issue-oriented and
not ``a series of one-liners like you heard in Atlanta.''
   Bush himself says he can't guarantee that no one will ``take a
swipe'' at Democratic rival Michael Dukakis, adding ``I can't
control everybody.'' However, the vice president and his staff say
the advice to convention speakers is to stay positive and focus on
the issues.
   Each night of the four-day convention, opening Monday, will be
devoted to broad themes, such as the successes of the Reagan-Bush
years, the issues and ideas of Bush and the differences between
Bush and Dukakis.
   President Reagan will kick off the process with a prime-time
address Monday night. The president will ``lay out the record of
the last seven years, and there's not a better man in America to do
that than Ronald Reagan,'' said campaign manager Lee Atwater.
   ``The second night you will see a lot of comparative speeches,
you will see comparative differences on quite a few vital issues,''
Atwater said. Among others, New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu will
attempt to debunk what Dukakis calls the ``Massachusetts miracle''
of economic recovery, while former presidential hopeful Pat
Robertson will talk about values.
   ``The third and fourth nights will be devoted to two things: No.
1 pointing out George Bush's qualifications, pointing out what he
has done with his life and why he is the best qualified man to be
president and lastly, of course, Thursday night he will be front
and center talking about where he wants to take country and what he
believes in.... This will really be his first time in front of the
American people front and center stage like this,'' Atwater said.
   Bush's staff says there will be a clear distinction between the
Republican convention and last month's Democratic convention in
Atlanta.
   Alixe Glen, a Bush campaign spokeswoman, said, ``It will be very
issue-specific. Bush has said many times this is not going to be
negative.
   ``It's not going to be a series of one-liners like you heard in
Atlanta,'' she said, referring to taunts that Bush was ``born with
a silver foot in his mouth'' and was ``a toothache of a man.''
   Referring to the Democratic convention, she said, ``I think it
was a little bit offensive to people watching it on television.
People want to be informed on issues. It's not like tuning in
(comedian) Joan Rivers.''
   To underscore the daily message, Republican leaders will hold
news conferences each day. Each news conference will feature two
speakers, a political person such as Atwater and an issues expert
prepared to deal in depth with a particular subject.
   To further cement the message, the campaign has assembled 10
caucus teams that, over the course of the week, will visit each of
the 54 delegations. Each caucus team will include a member of
Bush's family, a Cabinet member, a campaign official, an elected
official and a celebrity of some fashion.
   Ms. Glen described the overall operation as one that was
``blanketing the city. They're all hearing the same three
messages'' of the Reagan-Bush record, the issues of Bush and his
differences with Dukakis.

   Eduardo Castellou-Vogel whipped up the troops
one more time.
   ``We're party animals! Right?'' he yelled.
   ``Right!'' the 50 greeters lined up at gate 15-D in the New
Orleans Airport screamed back.
   ``What did you say?''
   ``Right!'' they yelled even louder.
   Delta Flight 4082 from San Francisco had not even finished
rolling up to the gate when Castellou-Vogel started his charges
clapping.
   ``Play some music,'' he shouted to the Onward Brass Band.
``Let's boogie!''
   The plangent sounds reached the passengers even before they made
their way up the ramp and caught sight of the cheering, clapping,
sign-waving throng decked out in red, white and blue to greet them.
   The exuberant cheers grew even louder for those who arrived in
this reknowned party town sporting Republican paraphernalia, like
the woman who deplaned from Nashville with two stuffed elephants
grazing atop her straw hat.
   ``It's all part of our effort to let people know New Orleans is
a friendly city and that we want them here,'' said Todd
Villarrubia, assistant director of airport operations for the
Republican National Convention.
   Volunteer greeters, 700 of them, were trained to give a rousing
welcome to the delegates, politicians, V.I.P.s, and assorted GOP
conventioneers arriving at New Orleans.
   The greeters began patrolling the two airport concourses Aug. 5
and will keep rolling out the red carpet through Aug. 20.
   From 8 a.m. to 11 p.m., they cheer, clap, call out greetings and
blow kisses at those arriving. Although they're there to greet
those attending the Republican National Convention, everyone on the
plane gets the same welcome.
   ``It was wonderful,'' said Mary Setar of Los Angeles, whose
husband came to play in a convention orchestra. ``I didn't know
what to think. I looked around thinking someone famous must be
arriving, but they were doing it for all of us. I think its
marvelous, just the kind of thing you expect from New Orleans.''
   Jonathan Price, a delegate from Monterey, Calif., agreed.
   ``It's absolutely wonderful. You come off the plane after a long
trip and sometihing like this really pumps you up.''
   For the greeters, seeing the reaction of the people arriving is
just part of the fun.
   ``It's kind of like a surprise birthday party,'' said Amie
Johnson, 13, as she prepared to meet another plane. ``I'm hoping to
see someone famous before we finish, but I greet everyone the same
way, even if they're not a celebrity.''
   In fact, the greeters said Saturday, spotting the real
celebrities arriving for the convention is tough.
   ``We saw Maria Shriver today. She had on big sunglasses, but my
friend recognised her,'' Fran Moorman said.
   Jane Ray is convinced that one television anchorman slipped past
incognito.
   ``Dan Rather wore a disguise when he came through,'' the greeter
said. ``I talked to some people who saw him. They said he had on a
false moustache, dark glasses and a baseball cap.''

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   James Burnett's chairmanship of the National
Transportation Safety Board ended Saturday night because the Senate
hasn't acted on his renomination, according to Burnett.
   He was nominated for a fourth term as chairman by President
Reagan on April 19, and his current term as a member of the NTSB
doesn't expire until late 1990.
   ``My term as chairman, however, expires at midnight tonight,
which has happened two times before,'' Burnett said Saturday in New
Orleans, where he was to attend the Republican National Convention.
   ``I hope to be reconfirmed,'' he said. ``I slept very well.''
   The two previous times, lack of Senate action on his nomination
meant Burnett lost his chairmanship to the board's vice-chairman.
The Senate Commerce Committee has not scheduled a hearing on his
renomination.
   The chairman of the committee, Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., ``is
not in Burnett's corner and he's not alone,'' Jim Fleming, Ford's
administrative assistant, said in July.
   The Senate is in recess until after Labor Day, and Burnett has
said his nomination is bogged down because of Democratic hopes to
replace him if Michael Dukakis wins the presidential election.
   ``I'm still hoping to be confirmed, but you never can take
Senate confirmation for granted,'' Burnett said. ``It's always
prolonged and it's designed to provide for careful scrutiny.''
   ``I don't presume to predict how the Senate will proceed,'' he
said.
   ``One mistake that a nominee subject to nomination cannot make
is to presume the results of the Senate's deliberations. To say I'm
sure I'm going to be _ all I'll say is I hope to be reconfirmed. I
don't take the Senate for granted.''

<HEAD>Barbara Bush Won't Turn into `Glamorous Princess'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barbara Bush is loyal to a fault but she says
she won't ``turn into a glamorous princess'' just because her
husband in running for president.
   ``What you see with me is what you get. I'm not running for
president _ George Bush is,'' says the snowy-haired wife of the
certain Republican nominee.
   Mrs. Bush says she is eager to get out on the campaign trail for
the man she ``absolutely adores'' and that she intends to tell
voters about his strength, courage and ability to get things done.
   But her loyalty to her husband of 43 years has its price.
   Calling herself the ``world's worst secret keeper,'' Mrs. Bush
said she has asked her husband not tell her about his choice for a
running mate. ``I've kept secrets, but it's agony,'' she said.
``This time, I want to be surprised.''
   At ease with reporters _ and lauded by many for her kindnesses
to them _ staffers on the Bush campaign refer to Mrs. Bush as their
``secret weapon.''
   But her quick wit and eagerness to chat got her into trouble
four years ago _ when she was quoted by reporters as saying of
Geraldine Ferraro, the 1984 Democratic vice presidential nominee,
``that $4 million _ I can't say it, but it rhymes with rich.''
   ``It was dumb of me, I shouldn't have said it,'' Mrs. Bush says
now, insisting she holds no grudge against the reporters. ``I blame
Barbara Bush. It was not attractive and I've been very shamed. I
apologized to Mrs. Ferraro and I would apologize again.''
   But unable to resist another quip, she adds, ``I'm not making
poems anymore.''
   Mrs. Bush admits feeling a bit envious of Kitty Dukakis, the
wife of Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
   ``She's so attractive,'' the vice president's wife confides,
dropping her voice to a near-conspiratorial whisper. ``I'd love to
look like her if you want to know the truth.''
   At 63, Mrs. Bush is a year younger than her husband George and
two years younger than the perfectly coiffed and designer-dressed
Nancy Reagan.
   But there will be no apologies here, thank you very much, for
the creamy complexion adorned with multiple ``laugh lines'' or the
curved figure that's more at home in silky afternoon dresses _ or
well-worn jeans _ than state dinner decolletage.
   ``I'm not going to turn into a glamorous princess,'' she says of
her campaign role.
   Well aware of the criticism heaped on Mrs. Reagan for her
high-priced tastes, Mrs. Bush says there's more to the race than
hair styles or designer frocks.
   ``I'm not going to worry about it. I have plenty of
self-confidence, not in how I look but in how I feel, and I feel
good about my husband, my children and my life,'' she said.
   That security has been gleaned during a life begun in what many
would consider affluence, as the daughter of the publisher of
McCall's magazine. But it has been tested during the years by the
ups and downs of her husband's career, and such personal loss as
the death of a daughter to leukemia.
   Mrs. Bush exudes serenity as she, Bush and their five children
enter the formal campaign to replace the Reagans at 1600
Pennsylvania Ave.
   It could well be their 29th residence.
   Since the 19-year-old sophomore from Smith College married the
tall and lanky Navy flier on Jan. 6, 1945, in her hometown of Rye,
N.Y., they've moved more than two dozen times. Virginia,
Connecticut, Texas, Washington, D.C., New York City and China have
been called home _ all during Bush's odyssey from military man to
Yale graduate to oil man to politician.
   Although her speech is marked by the well-mannered tones of the
blueblood background she shares with husband, she can be imperious
when he is criticized.
   Asked about the ``wimp'' image that's plagued her husband, she
sniffs, ``That's just what the Democrats say.''
   And when queried about the fact that polls indicate that fewer
women prefer her husband to Dukakis, she retorts:
   ``I'm slightly offended as a woman when I hear George has this
enormous gender gap,'' she said. She puts the onus on the party,
not her man.
   ``I think the Republicans have a gender gap, not George Bush,''
she says.
   Over the coming months, she'll campaign about 60 percent of the
time on her own, the rest with her husband, talking about the
things she ``knows best'' _ George Bush and her years-long fight to
battle illiteracy.
   She contends her husband is ``perfectly willing'' to let others
take the credit for things he's done. ``George Bush is a fellow who
believes in quiet leadership. You don't have to blow you own
horn,'' Mrs. Bush said.
   ``That's probably why our relationship is so good _ he lets me
think I think all the good things up.''

<HEAD>Doctors Say Mandela Improving, No Malignancy Found</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>

   Nelson Mandela, the imprisoned
South African black leader, has shown noticeable improvement since
he was admitted to the hospital for a lung ailment, a doctor said
Sunday.
   Dr. J.G. L. Strauss, medical superintendent at Tygerberg
Hospital, said a biopsy performed on tissue from Mandela's lungs
shows ``no evidence of malignancy, only a chronic inflammatory
condition of (the lining).''
   He said doctors drained fluid from Mandela's lungs on Saturday
morning.
   Mandela, 70, was transferred from Pollsmoor Prison to the
hospital on Friday morning. His wife, Winnie, and youngest
daughter, Zindzi, visited him on Saturday, Strauss said.
   ``Mandela is responding to treatment. He is without pain or
discomfort and has shown a noticeable improvement since his
admission,'' the doctor said.
   Mandela is the leader of the African National Congress, the main
guerrilla group fighting the South African government. Since 1962,
he has been serving a life term for sabotage and conspiracy to
overthrow the white-ruled government.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote
in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Zaccaro's `Prison' Term in $1,500-A-Month Apartment</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to show that comment made to newspaper.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Zaccaro Jr. is spending his four-month
prison term for selling cocaine in a $1,500-a-month luxury
apartment in Vermont with maid service, cable TV and privileges at
the YMCA next door.
   The son of former vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro
is staying in one of 12 units in a building designed for
expense-account business people on short assignments in Burlington,
Vt.
   ``We like to think of it as a cross between an apartment and a
hotel, with the advantages of both,'' a spokeswoman for the
building's owners said, according to a story in Sunday's editions
of the New York Daily News.
   Addison County State's Attorney John Quinn, who prosecuted
Zaccaro, took a dimmer view. ``This guy is a drug felon and he's
living in conditions that 99.9 percent of the people of Vermont
couldn't afford.''
   Zaccaro, 24, was convicted in April of selling a quarter-gram of
cocaine to an undercover police officer while a student at
Middlebury College in 1986. Judge Francis McCaffrey sentenced him
to one-to-five years in prison, with all but four months suspended.
   Zaccaro was determined eligible for the state Corrections
Department's ``house arrest'' program, under which non-violent
convicts can find their own housing and live under what is said to
be close supervision by corrections officials.
   ``The department doesn't provide the apartment,'' said John
Perry, director of planning for corrections. ``The prisoner does
that. We are only concerned that it meets minimum standards _ no
drugs, no guns, no college kids hanging around.
   ``Obviously, some people Mr. Zaccaro among them, have more money
than others, and they can afford a better place. The Aga Khan
probably wouldn't think much of his apartment. It's a matter of
standards of living. And we are not paying for it so we can't
decide a place is too luxurious if it meets the other criteria.''
   Corrections officials did say there was concern, however, that
dissatisfaction in the law enforcement community with the
comfortable way in which Zaccaro is serving time may threaten the
future of the house arrest program.
   ``It's a disgrace to put a drug dealer into the program,'' Quinn
said. ``I'm not happy about it and neither are other state's
attorneys.''

<HEAD>Many GOP Delegates Gainsay Gender GAP</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many delegates to the Republican National
Convention believe the ``gender gap'' is a fallacy despite recent
polls showing George Bush lagging in efforts to win over women
voters.
   Thirty-seven percent of the 1,215 delegates surveyed by The
Associated Press said the gender gap _ the voting patterns of women
compared to men _ is not a problem for the certain GOP nominee.
   Some delegates believe the Republican party does have a problem
with women voters, but doubt it will have a big impact on the
general election. Others dismiss the gender gap as a figment of the
media's imagination.
   ``I think he should stay just where he is,'' said Marylin
Shannon, a delegate from Salem, Ore. ``I think the gender gap is a
creation of the media. Reagan had a `gender gap' and he carried 49
of 50 states in the 1984 election.''
   ``I don't think it has anything to do with George Bush. It has
to do with Democrats vs. Republicans,'' said Raymond Shamie of
Walpole, Mass., the state GOP chairman. ``If women understood, they
would realize the Republican Party is genuinely compassionate.''
   ``That was also true prior to Reagan's general election and it
evened out,'' said Rep. Don Ritter of Allentown, Pa.
   ``This gender gap is idiotic,'' said Charlotte Mousel of Tustin,
Calif. ``Only the media thinks there is one.''
   Of the delegates surveyed, 452 said changes by Bush to attract
women voters were unnecessary, including 144 delegates who
described the gender gap as ``no problem.''
   The latest NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll conducted Aug. 5-8
and released Thursday showed Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis
holding a 53-31 lead over Bush among women voters.
   ``Women have been supporters of Bush from the early days because
George Bush is handsome, cordial and honest,'' said Marjorie Arsht
of Bellaire, Texas. ``I don't know who these women could be unless
they belong to some very extremist groups.''
   However, 25 percent of the delegates surveyed _ 301 of the 1,215
_ said the vice president should stress where he stands on issues
of concern to women, including federal day care programs, equal
rights and pay, abortion and education, to counter the gender gap.
   A total of 2,277 delegates will attend the Republican National
Convention next week.
   ``He should come forward more on women's issues,'' said Dennis
Delaney of Charlotte, Vt. ``Reagan is perceived to be weak on
women's issues. Bush will pay the price for that.''
   ``He has ... to express his sensitivity to problems facing women
such as single parenthood, lack of child support,'' said Mary Ellen
Miller of Owasso, Okla. ``He must present some ideas of his own on
how ... (to) eliminate some of these problems.''
   Some delegates believe that if Bush explains his stand, the
gender gap will disappear.
   ``When women find out about his programs, there will be a
different attitude,'' said Ken Beckerich of Oregon City, Ore.
``He's a strong advocate for women in the work force. Once you see
the real George Bush come out, you'll see the opinion polls change
fast.''
   Thirteen percent, or 160, of the delegates surveyed believe Bush
should appoint women to high-ranking posts in his campaign and
Cabinet.
   Ten percent of the delegates polled _ 122 _ suggested a female
vice-presidential candidate, frequently mentioning former
Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole and former United Nations
ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick.
   Other delegates believe the vice president needs to work on the
image he projects.
   ``I think he should go to women's groups and show his twinkling
blue eyes,'' said Marguerite Armstrong of South Burlington, Vt.
   ``Just become a better actor _ I think that impresses them,''
said Dwight Friedrich of Centralia, Ill.
   ``I think he needs a stronger stance,'' said Steve Lilly of
Nacogdoches, Texas. ``He's not a cowboy or a macho-man type which I
think the females prefer.''
   Barbara McKernan, a delegate from Bangor, Maine, and mother of
Gov. John R. McKernan, suggested Bush ``kiss more babies.''
   Ten delegates said it was important for Bush's wife, Barbara, to
get out on the campaign trail.
   ``She's his biggest asset as far as women are concerned,'' said
Bev Hammerstrom of Temperance, Minn.
   But William Maio, Jr., a delegate from Itasca, Ill., was
hard-pressed to advise Bush.
   ``I haven't the vaguest idea what makes the woman voter's mind
tick,'' he said.

<HEAD>Orchestra To Play Fragment Of Beethoven's 10th Symphony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The only surviving movement of Beethoven's 10th
symphony, which he was writing while on his deathbed in 1827, will
be played in public for the first time at a concert in London on
Oct. 18.
   The Sunday Times said the movement has been ``painstakingly and
brilliantly reconstructed'' from fragments of Beethoven's original
manuscripts by Dr. Barry Cooper, a lecturer in music at Aberdeen
University in Scotland.
   The Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Walter
Weller, will perform the symphony's first movement at Royal
Festival Hall, a spokeswoman said.
   Beethoven had promised the 10th symphony to London audiences
eight days before his death and had assured a London friend that
sketches of the new work were ``already in my desk,'' the Sunday
Times said.
   But the paper said posthumous researchers failed to find any
retrievable music among Beethoven's possessions. Biographers
disregarded an account by his secretary, Karl Holz, who said the
composer sat at the piano and played him the opening of the 10th
symphony.
   Five years ago, The Sunday Times said, Cooper was doing research
in a West Berlin library and found a set of sketches that matched
Holz's reminiscences of the opening movement. Cooper's belief that
these were from the missing 10th symphony was reinforced by the
discovery of additional sketches in the Beethoven archive in Bonn,
the paper said.
   ``By combining the two sets,'' Cooper was quoted as saying, ``I
began to find what Beethoven had in mind for the first movement. I
tried to keep very close to the sketches, to reconstruct the
movement as Beethoven envisaged it at that time.
   ``I had to fill in some harmonies and compose myself a few
linking sections but I did not invent any new themes. Those are all
Beethoven's,'' he was quoted as saying.
   The Sunday Times said none of Beethoven's scraps of notes
contained more than 20 bars, just a few seconds of music. But the
paper said that by laying the scraps end to end, Cooper assembled
an entire movement lasting almost 14 minutes.
   While Beethoven's Ninth Symphony ``shocked contemporary
listeners with its unprecedented choral finale,'' The Sunday Times
said that the first movement of the 10th symphony ``threatens to
dissolve the traditional barriers between movements, inventing a
more fluid structure for the symphony.''

   An English movie and a West German
movie split the top prize at the 41st international Locarno film
festival, which judges the work of new or little-known directors.
   ``Distant Voices, Still Lives'' by English director Terence
Davies presents a realistic look at a struggling 1950s family in
his native Liverpool.
   ``Schmetterlinge'' (Butterflies) by Wolfgang Becker of West
Germany is based on a story by British writer Ian McEwan and
chronicles the changes in a young man's life after he alone
witnesses the drowning of a little girl.
   Each film was awarded a top prize, or Golden Leopard, on
Saturday night by the festival jury, which evaluated 18 films over
an 11-day period.

   With flashlights and sleeping bags in hand,
about 45 children set out on an overnight expedition to find exotic
animals and observe their behavior.
   But they weren't on safari in the jungle _ they were deep in the
wilds of the nation's second-largest city, on an overnight tour
through the Los Angeles Zoo.
   The children, age 10 through 13, were the first group to
participate in a program sponsored by the Greater Los Angeles Zoo
Association in which participants spend a night at the zoo learning
about zoology, botany and astronomy.
   ``It's designed to be educational and fun. How often does a kid
get to sleep over at the zoo?'' said spokeswoman Lisa German.
   The objective of the program is to help foster a better
understanding and relationship between people and nature using the
zoo as a catalyst, German said.

   It's not part of Brent Justensen's job to
knock on neighborhood doors asking about jewelry, nor is he paid to
visit jewelers to find out the worth of a diamond ring.
   But Justensen, 24, who works for the Central Davis Sewer
District, did both last month after finding a gold ring graced with
18 diamonds.
   ``I thought it was fake at first,'' he said. ``Then I saw the
`14K' on the band and I thought I better find out for sure.''
   Justensen found the ring after he and other workers did a
routine cleaning of a section of sewer line that serves Angel
Street in Kaysville.
   ``I saw the band stuck into the grit, so I pulled it out and we
cleaned it off,'' he said.
   The ring was found on a Friday, and over the weekend Justensen
had it appraised by two jewelers who estimated its worth at $800 to
$1,200.
   ``I had to sit down, I was so shocked,'' he said. ``I just
figured if I'd lost something like that, I'd be excited to have it
back.''
   The next Monday, he returned to Angel Street and finally ended
up on Ann Hill's doorstep.
   ``Right on the spot, when asked from out of the blue, I couldn't
think about it,'' she said.
   But then, she said, ``It dawned on me. I wear a pendant just
like it and I showed it to him _ it was from a set my husband gave
me years ago.
   ``It was just like a dream,'' Hill said. ``You know, I had
gotten to the point where I didn't expect to see it again, and I
had kind of grieved over that ring.''
   Hill said it wasn't just the discovery that stunned her, but
Justensen's honesty. ``In this age, you just don't see that many
examples of it,'' she said. ``It's a wonderful thing to know we
have people like this in the world.''

   Anti-government groups in Burma called
for nationwide protests on Monday to demand that the ousted
president be tried in court and that political prisoners be
released, Japan's Kyodo news agency said.
   Kyodo, in a report Sunday from the Burmese capital of Rangoon,
said the groups also demanded compensation for families of those
killed in massive anti-government riots last week.
   Diplomats contacted in Rangoon said they saw leaflets calling
for more demonstrations but they could not confirm that the
protests were called specifically for Monday.
   On Friday, Sein Lwin resigned as president and head of Burma's
only party after four days of street riots that by official count
killed at least 95 people. Unconfirmed reports say hundreds of
people were killed.
   No new party leader or president has been named.
   The state-owned Radio Rangoon said security forces Sunday
entered the suburb of North Okkalapa, a site of fierce fighting
between troops and anti-government protesters last week.
   The radio said the forces entered to ``maintain law and order''
at the request of Buddhist monks and residents. But the broadcast
added that barricades were removed, bus services resumed and the
army donated 25 tons of rice to residents.
   Diplomats and returning tourists said downtown Rangoon was calm
over the weekend.
   ``There's definitely an appearance of returning to normality,''
one Western diplomat said. ``The real test will be how many people
come back to their offices Monday.''
   The broadcast said markets opened and buses resumed operation
Sunday in Mandalay, Burma's second largest city and another scene
of massive protests.
   Sein Lwin, called ``Burma's Hitler'' by one demonstrator, was
widely hated for brutally crushing dissent during his 17 days in
power and during 26 years of authoritarian rule by his predecessor,
Ne Win.
   Sein Lwin last month replaced Ne Win as chairman of the
country's single political party, the Burma Socialist Program
Party. Ne Win had ruled since leading a 1962 military coup that
ended Burmese democracy.
   On July 30, authorities arrested the government's leading
critic, Gen. Aung Gyi, along with others accused of ``anti-state
activities.'' Also arrested was Sein Win, the Burmese correspondent
of The Associated Press.
   In a document circulated to diplomats last week, protesters also
demanded a referendum on a multi-party political system, an end to
martial law, freedom for dissidents and student protesters and
reductions in the cost of living.
   It was not known how much support the students would receive
from other groups for another round of demonstrations. State
workers, Buddhist monks and teen-agers were among the tens of
thousands who rallied in 25 cities.
   The government has attempted to use the powerful Buddhist clergy
to call for peace. Radio Rangoon said authorities Sunday met with
Islamic leaders who issued ``a request to the faithful for peace
and tranquillity and rule of law.'' Moslems make up less than 5
percent of the population.
   In Sunday's Bangkok Post, two travelers who just arrived from
Rangoon wrote that Sein Lwin's resignation reinforced the
protesters' determination to press for elimination of the Burma
Socialist Program Party.
   ``We have cut one head off a many-headed serpent,'' they quoted
one protester as saying. ``The others remain. They all have to go.''
   In another article Sunday, the newspaper quoted Thai Prime
Minister Chatichai Choonhavan as denying rumors that Sein Lwin
sought refuge in Thailand.
   The rumors began Friday after a man described as Burma's
industry minister left Rangoon for a flight to Bangkok, New Delhi
and London.
   Officials contacted by The Associated Press in Thailand, India
and Great Britain said they had no information on Sein Lwin seeking
refuge there.
   Burmese have been angered by the country's mounting economic
problems, including rampant inflation and food shortages.
   Under Ne Win's isolationist policies, one of Southeast Asia's
wealthiest nations became one of its poorest, with an annual per
capita income of less than $200.
   In neighboring Bangladesh, at least 500 students marched through
the capital of Dhaka Saturday to support the Burmese riots and
demand Burma release the AP correspondent, Sein Win, and other
political prisoners.
   Members of the Central Students' Action Committee asked the
Burmese Embassy for a government investigation into acts of
repression in Burma.

   A wild duck nicknamed ``Donald'' who
waddled around for three months with a dart stuck in its neck while
eluding would-be rescuers was finally nabbed with a little corn and
twine and a lot of patience.
   Les Hubbell's trapping efforts paid off Saturday, and Donald
spent the weekend in a cage in Hubbell's kitchen before heading to
the veterinarian's office Monday to have the dart removed.
   Back in May, someone shot darts at the ducks that congregate
along the Mississippi River in this central Minnesota city. One of
the 5-inch darts stuck in Donald's upper neck.
   Other neighborhood folks had tried to capture the duck, a
mallard. But nets scared him, and he was too quick to grab. Donald
had no idea he was destined for the veterinarian and not the frying
pan.
   Hubbell's approach was to use a chicken-wire trap. He'd head
down to the river at 5:30 a.m. each day, set the trap with corn and
run a piece of twine from the trapdoor to his car.
   He'd sit there until 6:45 a.m., waiting for Donald to waddle
into the trap. It never happened _ until Saturday.
   ``It was just like deer hunting,'' Hubbell said. ``Sooner or
later he was going to step in there.''
   Department of Natural Resources officials gave Hubbell
permission to keep a wild animal until Donald can be nursed back to
health.

<TEXT>
   Attorney General Richard L. Thornburgh
expressed little enthusiasm Sunday for Edwin Meese's last-minute
order to have independent counsels investigate wrongdoing in
Congress, and said he saw only ``a very limited role'' for such
special prosecutors.
   Meese's final act Friday as attorney general was to sign an
order for special prosecutors to investigate criminal allegations
against members of Congress. Democratic lawmakers called it the
vindictive act of a man who had himself been investigated by two
such prosecutors.
   Meese said he had discussed the order with Thornburgh and added,
``I believe he agrees with it.''
   But Thornburgh, questioned on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation,''
declined to say whether he would go along with the order.
   ``I haven't had an opportunity to review the order,'' he said
from Boston, adding: ``I think there should be a very limited role
for so-called special prosecutors or independent counsels.''
   Thornburgh, a former Pennsylvania governor, headed the Justice
Department's criminal division during the Ford administration in
the mid-1970s and established the public integrity section that
prosecutes corrupt public officials.
   He said the public integrity office has ``done a first-class
job'' in tracking down official corruption _ ``federal, state or
local, wherever it may be.''
   ``Obviously, the attorney general who preceded me had some
reason for enunciating this order and I want to take a look at that
and give it due consideration. But the fact of the matter is that
if the evidence is there, investigations and prosecutions will be
undertaken against anyone who violates the federal criminal laws,
be they congressmen or ordinary citizens,'' Thornburgh said.
   The new attorney general said he was aware of ``conflicting
reports about the state of morale and commitment within the
department,'' an apparent reference to the furor caused by the
resignation of top officials during the waning days of Meese's
tenure.
   Thornburgh said he had not discussed with Vice President George
Bush whether he would stay on if Bush is elected president.
   ``I regard this as a job I'm going to do one day at a time,''
Thornburgh said.
   He also called ``very flattering'' speculation that he is in the
running for the No. 2 spot on the Republican ticket but added: ``I
have a job to do for this president and unless I've heard anything
from the vice president, I'm ready to go to work as attorney
general of the United States.''
   Thornburgh, 56, took office as the 76th attorney general Friday,
succeeding Meese, who resigned after saying he had been vindicated
by an independent counsel investigation of his affairs.
   Independent counsel James McKay concluded that Meese
``probably'' broke the law but decided not to seek his indictment.
Meese denied any improprieties and maintained that the department
was running normally despite defections by top aides during his
final months as attorney general.

<HEAD>Twelve Arrests At Park Demonstration</HEAD>

   A dozen people were arrested early Sunday after
a day of peaceful protests and music in a park where police and
civilians met in a violent, bloody confrontation one week earlier.
   More than 50 people were injured in the Tompkins Square Park
battle last weekend, 14 of them police officers, and nearly 100
charges of police brutality were filed.
   Sunday's arrests at the park in the East Village came when a
handful of demonstrators turned rowdy several hours after
Saturday's demonstrations and rallies, staged to protest the
earlier alleged police violence.
   Most of those arrested Sunday were charged with assault,
inciting to riot, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct, police
said.
   Four men were charged with attempted burglary after they tried
to break through the polished glass and brass front doors of an
expensive condominium building on one side of the park.
   The building, a target in last week's demonstrations, has come
to symbolize gentrification and unwanted change for many protesters
who feel they are being forced out of the neighborhood, an ethnic
melting pot for generations of immigrants, by high rents and
real-estate speculators.
   After the music ended late Saturday, about 150 chanting
protesters, accompanied by 90 police officers, marched across the
East Village to Washington Square Park.
   They were barred from entering the park by more officers and
police barricades. The protesters then paraded twice around the
park and returned to Tompkins Square Park shortly after midnight.
   As the night wore on, a few of the protesters became disorderly,
sparking the arrests, the police said.

   A locomotive rammed four train
cars into the back of a stationary train early Sunday morning
during a coupling maneuver, and police said about 100 passengers
were injured.
   The locomotive was moving too fast, and the force of the crash
threw passengers out of their beds and ripped seats from their
supports, police said. The collision occurred at 1 a.m. at Augsburg
station.
   ``There was a huge collision,'' said Horst Habermann, a
spokesman at the station, 40 miles west of Munich.
   The trains were loaded with Dutch, Belgian, British and French
vacationers returning from Austria, police said, without providing
an exact figure.
   Police spokesman Dieter Kuehle said about 75 people were treated
for minor injuries at the scene and that 25 required treatment at
local hospitals.
   Kuehle said authorities were trying to determine why the
locomotive was traveling so fast. He said he could not estimate its
speed.
   Habermann said the locomotive and other train equipment were
being checked to see if a malfunction caused the accident. He said
that despite the force of the impact, damage to the train cars was
slight.

<HEAD>Tap Dance: Bush Moves Out of Reagan's Shadow, Capitalizes on His
Popularity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   As George Bush approaches the high noon of his
quest for the Republican presidential nomination, he is striving to
move out of the shadow cast by President Reagan while seeking to
capitalize on Reagan's enormous popularity.
   Reagan's shadow has already shortened for Bush. These days he is
seldom dogged with questions about distancing himself from the
president. Instead, the questions now center on whether his
candidacy is exerting too much influence over the Reagan White
House.
   Both Bush and Reagan in recent days have fended off suggestions
that some presidential decisions have been motivated by an effort
to help the Bush campaign.
   And confronted with public opinion polls showing Bush far behind
among Democrats who voted for Reagan, Bush advisers have now
switched strategy to make sure that the Reagan shadow doesn't
disappear altogether.
   After first planning no contact at the Republican National
Convention between Reagan and his vice president, a joint rally is
now scheduled for Tuesday in New Orleans.
   It follows an upbeat joint appearance between Reagan and Bush at
a rally last Friday for senior administration officials at the Old
Executive Office Building, during which Reagan lavished praise on
his vice president.
   If all goes as planned, Bush's transformation into his own man
will be complete when he accepts the Republican presidential
nomination Thursday night at the Republican National Convention,
according to aides and GOP consultants.
   By the end of the convention, ``all the emphasis is going to be
on George Bush and his vice presidential nominee,'' said his chief
of staff, Craig Fuller.
   Lee Atwater, Bush's campaign manager, said that Bush ``has made
a conscious decision for seven years to be secondary to the
president.''
   ``And now that he's running for the president himself, he's
talking about how he feels, what he believes in, and where he wants
to take the country,'' Atwater said.
   To be sure, there are some areas in which Bush does not want to
put much light between himself and Reagan _ largely the current
economic expansion, now in a peacetime record of 69 months, and the
fact that most of the world is at peace.
   The vice president has been inching away from his close
identification with administration policies since he and aides
huddled for a week in late May at his vacation home in
Kennebunkport, Maine. The consensus from his advisers was
near-unanimous: he had to do more to establish his own agenda.
   Since then, Bush has hinted that he would be more aggressive in
dealing with the Soviets, would enforce civil-rights laws more
vigorously, would spend more on education and do more to clean up
the environment than the president he has served for the past 7{
years.
   He has also proposed many of his own initiatives, including a
$2.2 billion child care program, a ban on offshore ocean dumping,
and a reorganizaton of the anti-drug effort under the office of
vice president. He also has proposed a new White House ethics
office and a ``flexible freeze'' on federal spending.
   But most of Bush's moves away from the administration have been
cautious, for fear of appearing disloyal.
   ``I'm not going to change just to emerge from a shadow,'' he has
said.
   In a recent interview, Bush said he will differ with Reagan when
he feels he has a different set of goals.
   ``I have every intention of saying, here is what we've done and
and here are my priorities.
   ``But I'm not doing that to quote distance myself, to show my
own identity,'' he continued. ``I'm doing it to say, look, here is
what we've done. Here are the successes, and here are the
shortcomings, and here's what George Bush will do.''
   Still, Bush's close identification with the administration
continues to pose problems for him as Democrats keep driving home
their ``Where is George?'' slogan.
   When the general election campaign heats up after Labor Day,
Bush is expected to be hit repeatedly by Democrats for his role _
still vague _ in some of the less popular Reagan administration
decisions, including arms-for-hostages dealings with Iran and past
support for Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega.
   Meanwhile, the impact of Bush's candidacy has already been seen
in a number of recent presidential decisions _ including Reagan's
selection last week of a Hispanic, Lauro F. Cavazos, to be
education secretary _ fulfilling in advance a Bush campaign pledge.
   Reagan filled two other Cabinet vacancies with people on close
terms with Bush, naming former Pennsylvania Gov. Richard Thornburgh
to succeed Edwin Meese as attorney general and Wall Street
investment banker Nicholas F. Brady to follow James A. Baker III as
treasury secretary. Baker resigned to run Bush's campaign.
   The president also yielded to Bush's urgings in deciding to
allow a plant-closing notification bill to become law and in the
president's veto of a $299.5 billion defense authorization bill.
Reagan also has picked up on some of Bush's campaign themes,
including advocating the death penalty for ``drug kingpins.''
   ``I don't think it's as much a matter of Bush disagreeing or
separating himself from Reagan as much as demonstrating that his
agenda is a little different,'' said GOP consultant Charlie Black,
who is a Bush convention adviser.
   And John Sears, another Republican consultant, said: ``The real
moment of truth is when Bush accepts the nomination.''
   ``He can campaign on the virtues of what eight years of the
Reagan administration have brought to the country. And he can prove
himself presidential. In his acceptance speech, he can do it all,''
Sears said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Edward Bennett Williams, a fiercely
competitive criminal lawyer who won fame representing figures of
power in the nation's courtrooms and as a hard-driving sports
entrepreneur outside them, is dead at 68.
   A funeral mass will be held Tuesday at St. Matthew's Cathedral
here for Williams, whose 11-year battle against cancer ended with
his death Saturday at Georgetown University Hospital.
   Williams, a former owner of the Washington Redskins football
team and at his death the owner of the Baltimore Orioles baseball
team, made his reputation in the law defending the powerful in
their times of greatest need.
   His clients included former CIA Director Richard Helms, Sen.
Joseph R. McCarthy, labor leader Jimmy Hoffa, former Texas Gov.
John B. Connally and underworld boss Frank Costello.
   A former national treasurer of the Democratic Party, Williams
had a personal relationship with every president from John F.
Kennedy to Ronald Reagan.
   President Gerald Ford asked him to be director of central
intelligence in 1975 and Reagan offered him the same job last year.
Williams declined both times _ citing his preference for
independence the first time and failing health on the second
occasion.
   President Richard Nixon was an intense adversary during the
Watergate scandal when Williams represented the Democratic National
Committee in a suit against Nixon's reelection campaign committee.
   Nixon, in remarks later revealed by disclosure of the White
House tapes, had vowed to ``fix'' Williams. The celebrated lawyer
privately called Nixon ``snake brains.'' But years later the two
men became amicable after Williams wrote to Nixon.
   Sports heroes, political figures and fellow baseball team owners
paid tribute to Williams on his death.
   ``He was one of the most remarkable men I've every known,'' said
Bud Selig, owner of the Milwaukee Brewers team. ``He had a spirit
the rest of the world could take a lesson from.''
   The Brewers, playing host to Williams' Orioles on Sunday,
observed a moment of silence at Milwaukee County Stadium and
lowered flags to half mast.
   Joseph Califano, a former cabinet official of President Jimmy
Carter and one-time law partner with Williams, said, ``He was the
best everything. He was the best father, the best husband, the best
lawyer, the best partner, the best friend ... and he was
extraordinarily brave.''
   Former Oriole star Brooks Robinson, a Hall of Fame third baseman
and now announcer for the team, credited Williams with keeping the
Orioles in Baltimore rather than moving it to the nearby nation's
capital.
   ``He made a monumental effort as far as keeping the team
there,'' Robinson said. ``He was good for Baltimore baseball.''
   Williams succumbed to cancer after seven operations. But his
friends and associates said that almost to the end, the disease did
not deter him from hard work.
   ``I try to be guided by the ethics I was taught by the
Jesuits,'' Williams once said. ``A trial is like a war.''
   The son of a department store floorwalker, Williams was born May
31, 1920 in Hartford, Conn., and decided early in his life to
become a lawyer.
   He graduated with highest honors in 1941 from Holy Cross College
and enrolled at Georgetown University law school after his
discharge from the Army Air Force because of back injuries.
Williams survived the crash of a bomber during a training exercise,
an accident in which everyone else on board died.
   Williams set up his own law firm in 1949 and his first big-name
client was Sen. McCarthy, whose name became synonymous with
communist baiting.
   Williams, acknowledging that he represented unsavory characters,
never shunned the role.
   ``The more opprobrium that was attached to the client, the more
I relished the case,'' he said.
   Williams left the Redskins after co-owner Jack Kent Cooke
acquired controlling interest of the team and bought out Williams'
share. Williams by that time already had purchased the Orioles.
   Williams' tenure with the team was controversial and mixed with
success and failure. The Orioles won a World Series in 1983 but now
are at the bottom of the American League as Williams' acquisition
of high-priced stars generally failed to pan out.
   He is survived his wife, Agnes Anne Neill, a former lawyer in
his law firm; three children by his first wife, and four children
by his second marriage.

<HEAD>Police And Solidarity Supporters Clash In Gdansk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police and Solidarity supporters clashed
Sunday after ceremonies marking the eighth anniverary of strikes
that launched the now outlawed independent union federation,
witnesses said.
   Police moved in with truncheons against more than 100
demonstrators as they marched for about 45 minutes through Gdansk's
old town, said a Solidarity activist who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Witnesses said a melee broke out after a chair was thrown into
the line of security police as they attempted to block the marchers.
   Demonstrators then hurled tables and chairs from a nearby cafe
as the helmeted riot police rushed the crowd.
   About 20 young people were injured in the clash, several
seriously, and a dozen were detained, the Solidarity spokesman said.
   The state-run news agency PAP, in a dispatch late Sunday, said
six police officers were injured in the clash, which it said was
touched off by demonstrators ``behaving in an extremely aggressive
way.''
   It said the protesters chanted anti-communist slogans, attacked
police with rocks and demolished a cafe. PAP said the demonstrators
also interrupted the peaceful activities at a nearby fair.
   It gave no details about arrests or the number of injured
demonstrators.
   The clashes came after thousands attended a service at a nearby
church marking the anniversary of the beginning of the 1980 strike.
   After the services, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa spoke to 3,000
people who had gathered outside St. Brygida's church, a Solidarity
stronghold.
   ``Our struggle is continuing,'' Walesa said. ``We want to live
in a better Poland with more dignity.''
   Walesa said Solidarity leaders will meet on Aug. 28 in Gdansk to
discuss a text on the union's future.
   Walesa acknowledged that much had changed since 1980 and that
there was ``no return to that period.''
   He said the union is now committed to ``evolutionary
solutions,'' rather than radical action.
   Witnesses said that after the gathering at the church, marchers
made their way to the center of town, which was packed with
visitors to a local fair.
   The marchers shouted Solidarity slogans and were joined by large
numbers of passers-by before security forces blocked their path,
witnesses said.
   On Friday, 2,000 shipyard workers and other Solidarity
supporters attended a ceremony marking the anniversary near the
entrance to the Lenin shipyard.
   Police watched that ceremony but did not move in.
   At that ceremony, Walesa helped put wreaths and flowers on a
monument erected to honor striking shipyard workers killed by
security forces during labor unrest in 1970.
   On Aug. 14, 1980, workers in the Lenin shipyards in Gdansk began
a strike over reinstating a fired crane operator. Two days later
the demands grew to include an independent trade union, and
Solidarity was born.
   The union at its peak claimed about 10 million members, or
nearly one-third of the nation's population.
   The union was crushed when martial law was imposed in 1981. It
was banned by Parliament the next year.

<TEXT>
   House and Senate negotiators came close to
sealing a deal last week on overhauling the nation's welfare
system, but failed at least partly because of President Reagan's
continued insistence that it include some form of work requirement.
   The lawmakers left town for a three-week recess amid signs of
increasing frustration at the Reagan administration's adamant
opposition to any bill that does not include a workfare provision.
   ``We've said from the start, if there's no work requirement,
there's no welfare reform,'' said Charles Hobbs, assistant to the
president, who represented the White House at meetings Thursday on
Capitol Hill.
   But Hobbs added, ``I don't think we were the reason it fell
apart... I don't believe we were within striking distance of a deal
at all.''
   Intensive negotiations had progressed last week against the
backdrop of presidential politics. Democratic nominee Michael
Dukakis personally called some lawmakers to urge that a compromise
be completed this year.
   House members and some senators were optimistic that a daylong
series of meetings, offers and counter-offers Thursday could settle
the major differences. But that was before Hobbs and the White
House put on the brakes.
   There were signs at week's end that some Senate Democrats closer
to Reagan's position on the workfare requirements than the House
negotiators might prefer a showdown with the White House rather
than bow to it.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the House-Senate
negotiating team and the Democratic nominee for vice president,
indicated lawmakers might send Reagan a plan that doesn't meet his
specifications.
   ``We're not going to let him dictate the contents of the bill,''
Bentsen said Thursday.
   Both the House and Senate bills stress parental responsibility
for children, through more intensive child support collections and
a new emphasis on work. Each require states to set up large-scale
education, training and work programs for welfare mothers and to
offer child care, transportation and Medicaid benefits needed to
make the programs a success.
   But the House bill as passed would cost more than twice the
five-year, $2.8 billion Senate plan.
   House negotiators made a $1.1 billion concession by scrapping
financial incentives for states to raise cash benefits. And other
compromises had brought the two sides within shouting distance by
Thursday's last offers: $2.9 billion from the Senate, $3.3 billion
from the House.
   Lawmakers thought they had found a solution Thursday to concerns
over both costs and workfare: drop a requirement that two-parent
unemployed families be eligible for welfare, and along with it a
requirement that one of the parents work 16 hours a week in a
public job, beginning in fiscal 1994.
   ``I thought it was a real stroke of genius,'' said Arkansas Gov.
Bill Clinton, a Democrat, who helped Dukakis lobby lawmakers last
week by telephone. ``But it apparently created a White House
problem.''
   The Reagan administration for months had threatened to veto any
welfare overhaul bill that mandated two-parent welfare eligibility,
now allowed in only half the states. But last week the White House
insisted that the provision be kept _ as a vehicle for the 16-hour
work requirement.
   ``They were removing the only work requirement that's anywhere
in either of those bills,'' Hobbs said. ``The president's top
advisors will recommend a veto if there's no work requirement.''
   The House conferees already have agreed to a Senate provision,
also added under administration pressure, requiring states to
eventually enroll 22 percent of non-exempt welfare recipients in
their jobs programs.
   It's unclear whether lawmakers, when they return after Labor
Day, will resume discussions about dropping the two-parent
provision or try to keep it and hammer out a compromise on the work
requirement.
   But Clinton said the negotiators are so close to an overall
agreement ``there's no way the whole thing could fall victim to a
veto over this (mandatory work) issue.''
   ``We'll keep plugging away; we've still got time,'' he said.

<HEAD>Soviet Bomber Much Like U.S. B-1B, Air Force General Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's once-secret Blackjack
bomber is an expanded version of America's B-1B bomber, according
to the only U.S. Air Force officer to have seen the giant Soviet
warplane.
   Maj. Gen. Gordon E. Fornell described the bomber in a story in
Sunday's editions of the Dayton Daily News as being a close copy of
the B-1B, from its pivoting wings to the rotary cruise missile
launcher on its belly.
   For years, only the skimpiest details about the giant bomber
were available outside the Kremlin or Defense Department
intelligence files.
   The Soviets allowed Fornell and Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci to take a close look at the plane on Aug. 2 while the two
were on a four-day tour of Soviet military bases. Soviet officials
had earlier been allowed to climb aboard a B-1B during a visit to
Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota.
   Like the B-1B, the Blackjack is designed to fly low and fast
during long-range strategic bombing missions, firing nuclear-tipped
cruise missiles.
   Fornell, a former bomber test pilot with more than 6,000 flying
hours in more than 40 types of aircraft and an adviser to Carlucci,
said he believed there is evidence that the Soviets copied at least
the basic aerodynamic features of the B-1B.
   But he said it was impossible to tell during his 15-minute
inspection whether the Blackjack's designers merely took advantage
of public information on the B-1B or profited from espionage.
   ``It's hard to determine, not actually having flown the airplane
or seen its actual combat capability, what was done as far as the
internal workings of their equipment,'' he said.
   Even the crew assignments resemble the American bomber.
   ``It has four crewmembers, two pilots and what they described as
an offensive (systems operator) and defense systems operator, and
the layout inside is very similar to that of the B-1B,'' he said.

   Hungarian army dancers joined pipers,
buglers and drummers from 10 British Army regiments and a New
Jersey high school band Sunday in a parade opening the world's
largest arts festival.
   On a blustery afternoon in Scotland's capital, about 200,000
people thronged the sidewalks on Princes Street for the traditional
cavalcade heralding the 42nd Edinburgh International Festival.
   Some spectators were startled by the sounds of small firearms
and 20-foot whips that accompanied the parade, as army officers
saluted the procession from a review platform at the Royal Scottish
Academy.
   The 50 men and women dancers of the Hungarian army ensemble,
which is on its first visit to Britain, will join the other army
bands in the so-called tattoo at Edinburgh Castle _ a military
display with soldiers in kilts playing bagpies and drums at night
on the lighted castle grounds.
   ``We are not soldiers. Our army sponsors us and we all learned
to dance in the national ballet school,'' said dancer Csaba
Horvath, 20.
   The Governor Livingston Regional High School Band from Berkeley
Heights, N.J., specialists in bagpipes, bugles and drums, got a big
hand as they played ``Scotland the Brave.''
   ``We always like to get an American band _ they're so lively and
cheerful, they give you a lift,'' said parade organizer Wendy Jones.
   The teen-age band _ 47 girls in kilts and 25 boys in scarlet
coats and dark blue pants _ are on a two-week visit to Britain.
   The Aug. 14 - Sept. 5 festival features symphony orchestras, the
Houston Grand Opera production of John Adams' ``Nixon in China,''
plays in several languages, puppet shows, cabaret and art
exhibitions.
   The Edinburgh festival regularly comes up with something
extraordinary.
   This year it's likely to be the Japanese Ninagawa Theater
Company, with its innovative production of William Shakespeare's
``The Tempest.'' The company, then known as Toho, was the hit of
the festival in 1985 with Shakespeare's ``Macbeth'' and again in
1986 with the Greek tragedy ``Medea.''
   Besides the hundreds of performances at the official festival,
the unofficial Festival Fringe has 9,000 performances of 913 shows
by 473 companies in every available hall and in the streets.
   ``Our advance ticket sales this year so far are the best ever at
$261,800,'' said Mhairi Mackenzie-Robinson, who administers the
Fringe.
   But Frank Dunlop, director of the official festival, is
struggling this year with a budget of $4.6 million.
   ``I've just been to the first New York festival,'' said Dunlop.
``They had $8.5 million to spend and they did not, I think, do more
than we do or sell a higher percentage of seats.
   ``We do it by working everybody out of their wits,'' he added,
``and by depending on the kindness of other countries' governments
to help pay travel costs, because they are keen to send their
national artists to Edinburgh.''

   A television network stopped broadcasting a
historical series after producers protested that episodes were cut
to drop references to a former president, the father of an
opposition leader, a magazine said.
   The private Televisa network dropped the last 30 episodes from
its re-broadcast of the 170-episode ``Path to Glory'' epic, which
dramatizes Mexican history from 1917 to the 1938 nationalization of
Mexico's oil industry by President Lazaro Cardenas.
   Cardenas' son is Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the official runner-up in
the July 6 presidential election. The younger Cardenas says he was
fraudulently denied victory by the government and the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party.
   Cardenas, candidate of the left-of-center National Democratic
Front, called for nationwide demonstrations Sunday to demand the
government clear up allegations of vote fraud.
   Proceso magazine reported that Televisa's July 30 episode of
``Path to Glory'' was altered to delete some historical facts and
figures and create fictional characters missing from the original
version.
   Televisa also announced it was suspending its broadcast of the
series, which was commissioned by the network and the government's
Social Security Institute.
   The popular series, featuring 700 actors and 5,000 extras, was
broadcast in its entirety last year.
   Fausto Zeron Medina, historical adviser to the series, suggested
in an interview with the magazine that the episode was censored in
part for political reasons.
   ``The immediate explanation is obvious. The case has a political
facet: the strength that Cardenism has in the current (political)
dispute motivated a white hand to cut `Path to Glory,''' Zeron
Medina said.
   Raul Araiza, director of the series, said: ``I don't know the
cause of the mutilation but neither does that matter to me. It
appears to me to be an act of barbarism without precedent.''
   Zeron Medina protested the dropping of the episodes in letters
to Televisa's president, Miguel Aleman Velasco, and Social Security
Institute director Ricardo Garcia Sainz.
   ``With surprise I found that all the scenes referring to the
presidential activities of Lazaro Cardenas were suppressed,'' Zeron
Medina wrote to Aleman Velasco.
   Zeron Medina also told Proceso that Garcia Sainz summoned him to
a meeting at the institute in March, about two months after the
rebroadcast of ``Path to Glory'' began.
   ``There in his office he told me that `Mr. President' had asked
him to be careful with the army, with the relatives of the
historical figures, with the heroes and religious sentiments,''
Zeron Medina said.
   When asked which president, Garcia Sainz responded: ``that of
the Republic,'' Zeron Medina said. Mexico's outgoing president is
Miguel de la Madrid.
   A Televisa spokesman reached by telephone said the network would
not have any comment on the matter until Monday.
   Lazaro Cardenas ensured his stature as perhaps the most revered
of Mexican presidents when he nationalized the oil industry. He
also distributed millions of acres of land to peasants under
Mexico's agrarian reform law.
   The elder Cardenas died in 1970.
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas has claimed he defeated governing party
candidate Carlos Salinas de Gortari in the July 6 election. He was
a member of the governing party before resigning last year to mount
his own candidacy.
   The Chamber of Deputies, sitting as the Electoral College,
begins a session Monday to ratify the election results.
   Opposition parties accused Televisa of pro-government bias in
covering the presidential campaign and of virtually ignoring
post-election protests.

   A panhandler in Greenwich Village puts his pitch
to a rap beat:
   ``Give a contribution,
   ``To fight destitution,
   ``Without retribution,
   ``Money's the solution.''
   Mayor Edward I. Koch, however, believes the solution is to put
up posters in the subways, telling New Yorkers to pass that beggar
by.
   ``In most cases, in my judgment, the money that you give in the
street to beggars goes for booze and drugs,'' Koch said last week.
``It is not in the best interest of this city to encourage people
to panhandle instead of looking for jobs.''
   For many New Yorkers, every day brings an encounter with two,
three or more beggars: shouting mendicants who move from car to car
on the subways with tales of lost homes, unemployment or AIDS;
passive panhandlers slouched on the street behind placards saying
``homeless'' and ``hungry;'' street psychologists who can mug a
queasy conscience with a soft ``God bless you'' after being turned
down.
   ``The best thing you can do if you really want to help,'' Koch
said, ``is to give any such charitable contributions to your church
or your synagogue or the Salvation Army or a whole host of
legitimate agencies that will then use the money for a valid and
good purpose, not for booze and drugs.''
   ``There is nothing wrong about giving money to organizations,''
said Ed Abrahams, New York director of the Coalition for the
Homeless, ``but I don't think when people pass a panhandler they
say, `There's 25 cents that I won't give to my church this week.' ''
   Koch's anti-begging pronouncements have cut down on
contributions, ``but not as much as we thought it would,'' a
panhandler on Fifth Avenue who identified himself as Gerry said
Sunday morning.
   As for the fear that the money goes for drugs and alcohol, ``it
just isn't true,'' said the soft-spoken, white-haired man who said
he has been on the street since January. ``I would say _ I know an
awful lot of panhandlers _ that it's less than 5 percent.''
   ``There are a lot of drug addicts out here,'' said a panhandler
up the street who identified himself as Ed P. ``They need $80-$90 a
day. Some of them get it and shoot it right up.''
   ``If I make $20 a day that's not too bad,'' said Ed, who sleeps
outside the Museum of Modern Art and insists that he is a
panhandler, not a beggar. ``Panhandler sounds better,'' he said.
``A panhandler doesn't steal.''
   Asked why begging is so prevalent, Koch said: ``I guess because
we're easy marks.''
   A survey of 250 people commissioned by Crain's New York Business
earlier this year found that two-thirds gave money to beggars, and
51 percent said they contributed to organizations that help the
homeless.
   The Metropolitan Transit Authority surveyed 1,200 New Yorkers
and found that three out of five gave money to beggars, although 80
percent said they found the panhandlers annoying.
   ``Tourists don't give you money,'' said Gerry, who was all but
ignored by passersby. ``Native New Yorkers give you money.''
   Begging isn't illegal in New York, though panhandlers may be
encouraged to move.
   Seattle, prodded by downtown merchants who were afraid of losing
their customers, enacted an ordinance last year to ban aggressive
panhandling. That inspired laws this year in Minneapolis and Tulsa,
Okla., while Portland, Ore., went after aggressive beggars last
year by making it illegal to interfere with pedestrians.
   Terry Grace, director of development for the soup kitchen at
Holy Apostles Episcopal Church in Manhattan, endorsed Koch's
advice. ``If you give money directly to beggars, they might not use
it to get food,'' she said.
   But the Rev. Bill Greenlaw of Holy Apostles called the mayor's
position ``utterly gratuitous and insensitive.''
   ``I'm assaulted, as is everyone else, by people with their hands
out,'' Greenlaw said. ``I'm offended by that too, but the answer,
it seems to me, is not to advise people not to respond.''
   If the goal is to force beggars to rely on government and
charitable programs, Greenlaw added, there just aren't enough
programs.
   His church, which has 125 members, serves up to 1,000 people in
its soup kitchen every day in addition to taking 300 or so bag
lunches to women and children in dilapidated hotels.
   Douglas Platt, executive director of the First Moravian-Grand
Central Drop-In Center, said 90 percent of the homeless who visit
that center suffer some kind of chemical dependence.
   ``Many panhandlers are ignored by the social service system,''
Platt wrote in The New York Times, ``but the frustrating truth is
that these out-of-pocket donations only aggravate the problems they
are meant to relieve.''
   The root of the problem, Abrahams said, is that welfare payments
are below the poverty level. ``If you have a place to live, you may
have to decide between paying the rent and buying food,'' he said.
   ``Begging is not an equitable way to deal with the problem, or
an efficient way. But it's the only way for some people,'' Abrahams
said.

   Cardinal John J. O'Connor expects to begin a
weekly half-hour television program next month, his chief spokesman
said Sunday.
   The New York prelate's program hopefully will feature ``an
entirely new type of format for a religious program,'' according to
Monsignor Peter Finn, O'Connor's spokesman.
   O'Connor will spend the program discussing religious topics with
guests, Finn said. But he declined to discuss the program in depth,
saying details still were being worked out.
   When O'Connor was named archbishop of New York in 1984 he
expressed interest in having such a regular television program, and
has said he believes religious leaders must use the electronic
media to get their message across.
   In the 1950s another New York bishop, Fulton J. Sheen, became
one of the most popular figures in the early days of television.
His half-hour program on ABC, ``Life is Worth Living,'' drew an
estimated weekly audience of 25 million in 1954.

<TEXT>
   An attacker tried to burn two U.S.
Embassy cars in the carport of an embassy worker's home near the
capital, police said Sunday.
   Police were trying to determine if the attack was related to
earlier attacks on the property of the U.S. and South African
officials.
   In the latest incident, someone poured a flammable liquid around
two U.S. Embassy cars Saturday night in Holder, a suburb of
Canberra, said a police spokesman who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The assailant threw several lit matches on the fluid, which
burst briefly into flames then went out, the spokesman said. Police
found a note in the carport with an anti-American slogan, but
declined to reveal its contents.
   No one was injured.
   ``Obviously security is uppermost in everyone's mind,'' the
spokesman said. ``We will discuss a review of security at the
embassy.'' No one at the U.S. Embassy was immediately available for
comment.
   The spokesman said the attempted arson may be related to three
similar incidents involving the property of the U.S. and South
African embassies.
   On March 22, two incendiary devices were thrown into the
courtyard of a South African Embassy staff member's residence,
causing minor damage to a wall.
   On April 10, a Honda car belonging to the South African
Embassy's third secretary was destroyed in a firebomb attack.
   And on July 17, a firebomb caused superficial damage to a car
belonging to a U.S. military attache. No one was hurt in any of the
attacks.

<HEAD>Zumwalt: Son's Death Pushes Him To Fight Harder For Compensation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Adm. Elmo R. Zumalt Jr., who ordered
the use of Agent Orange in Vietnam, says the cancer death of his
son moves him to work harder for compensation for other veterans
affected by the toxic defoliant.
   ``There are still many hundreds of veterans who do need help,''
Zumwalt said Saturday, the day his son died. ``I believe very
strongly now that the evidence is clear that the Agent Orange is
responsible for the problems many veterans are having.''
   Elmo R. Zumwalt III, 42, who was exposed to Agent Orange, died
at his home in Fayetteville. He was diagnosed in January 1983 as
having non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Two years later doctors found he had
lymphoma Hodgkins disease.
   Zumwalt's son, Elmo Russell Zumwalt IV, suffers from a
congenital dysfunction that confuses his physical senses.
   Since the war, Adm. Zumwalt and his son had pushed for
government assistance to veterans affected by Agent Orange.
   On June 30, the U.S. Supreme Court removed the last legal
obstacle to a $180 million settlement between Vietnam veterans and
the manufacturers of Agent Orange. The justices let stand rulings
that dismissed lawsuits by about 300 veterans who had challenged
the 1984 settlement.
   In Washington, a White House spokesman said, ``The President and
Mrs. Reagan are deeply saddened and extend their prayers to the
Zumwalt family.''
   The younger Zumwalt was commanding a boat along the rivers of
the Ca Mau Peninsula when his father, the American naval commander
in Vietnam, ordered the spraying of Agent Orange to defoliate the
jungle along the waterways in order to save servicemen by depriving
the enemy of concealment for ambushes.
   Before the spraying, U.S. forces had a 6 percent casualty rate
each month. Afterward, that figure dropped to less than 1 percent.
   ``I do not second guess the decisions Dad made in Vietnam, nor
do I doubt for a minute that the saving of human life was always
his first priority in his conduct of the war,'' the younger Zumwalt
once said. ``I have the greatest love and admiration for him as a
man, and the deepest respect for him as a military leader.''
   Young Zumwalt once swam through water doused with Agent Orange
to collect weapons from a convoy of Viet Cong boats, winning over a
hostile crew that had called him ``the little admiral'' and ``brass
brat'' behind his back.
   The Zumwalts chronicled their battle with cancer in 1986 with
the book, ``My Father, My Son,'' which they wrote with author John
Pekkanen. The book was presented in a made-for-television movie in
May.
   Zumwalt said his son was strong until the end, even joking and
teasing with family members during conversations that began Friday
evening.
   ``We had a long conversation, his wife and children and his
brother and me, with him from about 7:30 (Friday night) until about
1 o'clock this morning,'' the admiral said Saturday. ``He was
rational and very courageous.''
   Zumwalt was standing by his son's side with other family members
when his son died in his sleep.

<TEXT>
   A sprightly new production of Rossini's ``The
Barber of Seville'' has been added to the New York City Opera
repertoire.
   At the second performance in the New York State Theater on
Saturday, Erie Mills was Rosina, Gran Wilson was Count Almaviva,
Robert Orth was Figaro and Jan Opalach was Rosina's guardian Dr.
Bartolo.
   Lofti Mansouri directed stage action, which was lively but not
eccentric. Desmond Heeley, who has designed prestigious stage and
opera productions in London and at the Metropolitan Opera, designed
sets and costumes. Some of Miss Mills' costumes looked like those
of Rosina's soon after the opera's premiere in 1816.
   The set was attractive, with a facade centered inside an
archway. The facade was turned around to become either an outside
door with street in front of it or the inside door of a room.
   Miss Mills seems so natural as Rosina, her singing so delightful
and her acting so charming, that it would be easy simply to accept
and ignore her. Thinking about it later, one recognizes and
appreciates her artistry.
   Figaro was dressed in a green velvet suit trimmed with orange.
With Orth's toothy smile, he presents himself originally as an
early 19th century nerd. This Figaro smoothed out into a pleasant
fellow rather than the ``character'' he sometimes is.
   Wilson has a sweet tenor that does not turn cloying and he's a
slim, elegant Count. He also acted so effectively in his
impersonations as an elderly, drunk soldier and a singing teacher
that he added much to the mirth of this ``Barber.'' Opalach, in a
gray wig that stuck out like donkey ears on each side, sang with
conviction and was amusing as Bartolo.
   Harry Dworchak as the real singing teacher and Jane Shaulis as
Bartolo's housekeeper sang well and James Billings made the tiny
part of a sleepy servant greatly amusing every time he was on stage.
   Music director Sergiu Comissiona conducted.
   The opera was sung in Italian. English surtitles in white
flashed on a screen above the stage but were overlighted and left
on the screen so briefly that most of them couldn't be read
enitrely.

   A charismatic Catholic church has
attracted even more than the 20,000 people predicted from across
the country for a service at which many expect miracles of healing
or at least faith, officials say.
   Monday rosary services at St. John Neumann Catholic Church have
become the focus of national attention since three parishioners
claimed to receive messages from the Virgin Mary during weekly
rosaries.
   ``I believe Mary will bring blessings to us then,'' said Mary
Constancio, a former hospital therapist, who along with her husband
quit their jobs to spend more time praying.
   Thousands of pilgrims arrived for two days of worship in advance
of the Monday night Mass and rosary.
   Lubbock police and the Texas State Guard, which are responsible
for crowd control, said dozens of worshipers stayed at the church
overnight into Sunday.
   ``They were down there all last night, praying and lighting
candles and singing,'' said Col. Ray Huffman of the Lubbock police.
   Mike Slate, Mary Constancio and Theresa Werner have said that
Mary has told them to expect a miracle on Monday's Feast of the
Assumption, the day Catholics celebrate the ascension of Mary into
Heaven.
   While many handicapped people have come to the church hoping for
phsyical healing, others said they were seeking spiritual renewal.
   Roberto Garcia, his wife, niece and 11-year-old son drove from
Fort Morgan, Colo., to Lubbock and attended Sunday's Mass.
   ``My son has been sick a long time,'' Garcia said. ``Last year I
had to carry him in my arms. Now he can walk but he's still sick.''
   Garcia said he doesn't know what to expect Monday but wanted to
come anyway. ``Maybe my son can get better,'' he said.
   Cindy Lewis of Miami said she came to strengthen her faith.
   ``Like they said in church, that so many people would come here
to pray together is a miracle,'' she said. ``It really doesn't
matter what happens tomorrow (Monday).''
   Sunday's throng of worshipers sparked concern from officials
about crowd control on Monday.
   ``I've seen people leave their car in the middle of traffic if
they're late for a (football) kickoff,'' said policeman Huffman.
``You can just imagine what would happen if they're late for a
miracle.''

<TEXT>
   AIDS has spawned a new kind of hypochondriac:
people convinced they are infected by the AIDS virus despite
medical evidence to the contrary, a psychologist who has treated
such people said Sunday.
   Even monthly blood tests for up to a year have failed to quell
the fear in some of them, said Miami psychologist Larry Harmon. In
many cases, the fear stems from guilt over a past sexual incident.
   ``These people are terrified,'' and their condition can make
them avoid sex with their spouses for fear of infecting them, and
disrupt their concentration at work, Harmon said.
   One of his patients was afraid to hold his newborn baby for fear
of infecting the child, he said in an interview.
   Harmon discussed treatment of people with ``AFRAIDS,'' which
stands for acute fear regarding AIDS, at the annual meeting of the
American Psychological Association.
   When anxiety and depression causes such symptoms as weight loss,
fatigue or reduced resistance to disease, afflicted people
interpret the symptoms as signs of AIDS, he said.
   Even a bruise from a bumped elbow may be perceived as the mark
of an AIDS-related cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma, he said.
   He said he has treated 10 patients since seeing his first case
two years ago, and other psychologists have told him they are
seeing it too. But he did not have any figures on how many cases
might exist.
   The problem often is rooted in guilt over an extramarital
affair, a visit to a prostitute or a homosexual experience, he
said. Sometimes the experience occurred years before.
   Sex with an infected person can spread the AIDS virus.
   One man Harmon treated, married for 10 years, had had sex wih a
female neighbor. About a month later he heard his minister describe
AIDS as punishment for sins, and about a week after that he noticed
he had lost weight and suffered diarrhea. Both were due to anxiety,
but the man interpreted them as evidence of AIDS, Harmon said.
   His worry persisted after a blood test proved negative, and he
was referred to Harmon by an AIDS hot line.
   Most people can significantly reduce their anxiety with
treatment, he said. Therapists can explain the facts about acquired
immune deficiency syndrome, and explain how people who are worried
tend to become over-concerned by coughs or other ``symptoms'' most
people would ignore.
   Harmon asks his patients to carry copies of negative blood test
results in their wallets. He also teaches them about reducing
anxiety by focusing on their present lives and what is going on
around them, and dealing with guilt.
   Harmon said people who recognize the problem in themselves or
others should contact an AIDS hot line for the name of a
psychologist familiar with AIDS-related issues.

   A race car bumped into another car at a
rural speedway, sending it careening into a fence and killing a
4-year-old spectator, authorities said.
   Five other people were injured in the accident during a stock
car race Saturday night at Tommy's LaSalle Speedway three miles
east of here.
   ``It's the first time anything like this happened,'' Tom Glynn,
owner of the speedway.
   ``When you read about it happening at the big tracks _ Daytona
or Talladega _ it's one thing,'' he added. ``But when it hits home,
it's something. It was a terrible thing to happen.''
   The dead boy was identified as Joshua Rhodes of Streator, said
Master Sgt. LeRoy Lawless of the Illinois State Police.
   Both Lawless and Glynn said a car driven by Gary May, 24, of
Minonk was bumped by another car coming out of a turn on the oval
track. May's car hit a retaining fence, uprooting several fence
posts embedded in concrete and sending a piece of fence into the
first two rows of spectators.
   May was uninjured. The driver of the car that bumped his car has
not been identified.
   ``It wasn't anybody's fault,'' Glynn said. ``They we're just
going at it (racing) hard.''
   The Saturday night races draw as many as 2,000 spectators, Glynn
said.
   Seven-year-old Jason Bryan of Ottawa was listed in fair
condition Sunday at Illinois Valley Community Hospital in Peru,
said spokeswoman Barb Husser. Four other people were either treated
and released after the accident or held overnight, she said.

   The Soviet Union pulled half its troops out of
Afghanistan by Sunday, one day before the deadline, and rebels
captured a key provincial capital after troops left, the commander
of Soviet forces in Afghanistan said.
   Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov said at a news conference in the Afghan
capital, Kabul, that none of the troops he commands remains in 25
of Afghanistan's 30 provinces, the official Tass news agency
reported.
   Under a U.N.-sponsored agreement, the Soviet Union was to have
half its estimated 100,000 troops out by Monday.
   U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas fired missiles at the Afghan
capital, Kabul, and shelled two other Afghan cities, killing 19
people, the news agency said Sunday.
   From May 15, when the Soviet pullout began, to July 15, the
anti-communist insurgents carried out almost 3,000 armed attacks
and 96 terrorist and diversionary operations, Gromov told reporters.
   He confirmed Western reports that rebels took control of the
northern provincial capital of Kunduz after Soviet troops left the
area in the first week of August. Tass quoted him as saying he
``had no doubt that in the very near future,'' Afghanistan's
Marxist government would regain control.
   Kunduz lies 40 miles south of the Soviet border along a major
road leading from Kabul to the Soviet Union.
   Reports reaching Islamabad, Pakistan, said almost all provincial
capitals remain in communist hands. Guerrillas have seized three
provincial capitals since May 15 but abandoned them later under
heavy Soviet aerial bombardment.
   Red Army troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979. Under
U.N.-mediated peace accords signed in Geneva in April, all the
troops are to be out by Feb. 15.
   Afghanistan's official Radio Kabul said the halfway point in
withdrawal was reached Saturday, when a Soviet motorized regiment
of 200 vehicles and 3,000 troops left for home from the western
Afghan city of Herat.
   As President Reagan flew from Washington to New Orleans, his
spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, told reporters: ``The Soviets appear
to be on schedule in withdrawing from Afghanistan. Under the Geneva
accord, half of their forces should be out by today. We can never
be absolutely certain, but it appears they have met that schedule.''
   Officials of the Afghan government said their armed forces were
capable of defending the country without Soviet troops.
   ``At this critical moment in the fate of the country, the armed
forces will steadfastly defend the republic, strengthen vigilance
and battle-readiness. On this score I, as the head of the general
staff, have no doubts,'' Col. Gen. Shah Nawaz Tanai told the Soviet
Red Army newspaper, Krasnaya Zvezda, in an interview published
Sunday.
   Some Western, Pakistani and guerrilla sources have predicted
Kabul's communist government will fall quickly after the Soviet
military leaves. Even a former Soviet military adviser in
Afghanistan, Maj. Gen. Kim M. Tsagolov, has expressed doubt the
Afghan army can hold its own after the Soviet pullout.
   Tanai, in the newspaper interview, acknowledged rebels were
focusing their attacks on areas evacuated by Soviet troops, but
said Afghan government forces are ``resolutely repulsing'' the
guerrillas.
   In weekend fighting, government troops killed several insurgents
in the Asmar district of the Afghan province of Kunar, Tass
reported. Twenty-seven rebels were killed and an arms depot was
captured in the Injil district of the western province of Herat,
the news agency said.
   Tass did not say whether the combat operations were conducted by
Afghan or Soviet troops.
   In Kabul, three missiles killed four women and a child and
wounded six people, Tass reported. Shelling in the residential
areas of Gardez and Khost killed 14 people and wounded 20,
according to the news agency.
   Tass said a mosque was destroyed and several apartment buildings
damaged in Gardez, about 60 miles southeast of Kabul.
   Afghan army units killed 30 rebels in the Buri Heil district
near Khost, the news agency said.

<TEXT>
   Democrats taking up the chant ``Where
was George'' might be tempted to ask their own vice presidential
nominee Lloyd Bentsen, ``Where is George?''
   Bentsen, campaigning in the state both he and Bush call home,
hardly ever mentions the vice president. His barbs, even when
clearly aimed at Bush, start with ``The Reagan administration,'' or
``The Republicans,'' or simply ``They.''
   Around the country, Democratic partisans recite ``Where was
George'' as both a rallying cry and chide to Bush as failing to
speak up when the administration made policy gaffes like the sale
of arms to Iran.
   Bentsen denied in an interview with reporters that he is making
any special effort to avoid discussing Bush by name. But even in
the small group covering his campaign, he is keeping his jibes
subtle.
   ``I'm going to make the issues and pound on them and that's what
I'm trying to do,'' the Texas senator said.
   Bentsen's aides say there are several reasons not to attack Bush
directly, chief among them the vice president's own Texas
background. Texans may not warm to personal attacks against one of
their own.
   In addition, while Bentsen and Bush are not political allies,
they and their families are privately friendly, according to both
sides. The vice president himself has been holding fire, saying
he's running against Democratic presidential nominee Mike Dukakis
and not Bentsen, who is one of Texas' most popular figures.
   Bentsen seems to be returning the favor. For example, he
declined to comment on a published report that Bush has been
misrepresenting his war record.
   ``I'm not going to get into that, what happens in combat,'' said
Bentsen, himself a World War II bomber pilot. ``I'm not going to
question his story at all.''
   But while there's cordiality now, the political climate is
heating up. Bush has announced plans to move some of his national
campaign operation to Texas.
   ``It doesn't worry me, he's had his operations here before''
Bentsen said of Bush, referring to the 1970 campaign when the two
men last faced each other in an election and Bentsen won.
   Bentsen says he is prepared to take the gloves off and start
pounding Bush when it becomes necessary.
   ``I'm sure we will be as we go along,'' he said. ``Let's see how
the campaign develops. I've attacked the issues and this
administration of which he is a major part.''

   Massachusetts Republicans believe they have a
special role at the national convention, providing other delegates
an inside look at the Democrat they love to hate _ Michael Dukakis.
   ``The people from Massachusetts know Mike Dukakis best, and they
will help call attention to the `Massachusetts Mirage' and help to
describe who Mike Dukakis really is,'' said Andrew Card, a former
White House aide and state representative who has rejoined the Bush
campaign. The delegation will act as a ``truth squad of sorts,'' he
said.
   Joseph Malone, the former state GOP executive director who is
running against Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said he has talked
to Georgia Republicans ``who lament the fact that they never really
got the message out about how bad Jimmy Carter would be for
America. We don't want to repeat that mistake.''
   ``The Massachusetts delegation will be the most well-informed
delegation in terms of Mike Dukakis, and there's a responsibility
on our part that other Republicans throughout the nation know the
facts,'' Malone said.
   Dukakis has been the chief target of state Republicans since he
won his first gubernatorial race in 1974. He is in his 10th year as
governor, losing a re-election bid in 1978 and returning to office
in 1983.
   State Republicans believe the nation is getting a skewed view of
Dukakis through television.
   ``He is holding himself out now as something he really isn't at
all, portraying himself as a moderate and in some cases a
conservative,'' said Assistant Senate Republican Leader David Locke.
   ``He's an authentic, dues-paying, card-carrying, textbook
liberal. That's what he's always been, but that's not the image he
portrays,'' Locke said. ``I think we might be helpful to the other
delegations who are looking for an inside view of Dukakis.''
   Massachusetts Republican Chairman Ray Shamie plans to unveil a
video Tuesday produced by the state committee that attacks Dukakis
on issues from the environment to the budget. State party officials
plan to distribute the tape to the other 49 state party chiefs.
   But the Massachusetts delegation does not have any plans to
dispatch delegates to various convention caucuses in a formal way.
   ``We've discussed that and my understanding is that we will just
wait to be pounced upon,'' said House GOP Leader Steven Pierce.

   Sonny Bono is on the road again.
   As part of the superstar duo Sonny and Cher in the 1960s, Bono
and his former wife toured to promote such hits as, ``I've Got You,
Babe.''
   Now as mayor of Palm Springs, he's trying to drum up business
for his city.
   Bono arrived Sunday in Toronto, where he will spend four days
trying to sell the benefits of the desert city at a convention of
trade associations.
   The mayor will work at Palm Springs' booth, autographing
posters, giving interviews and promoting the Palm Springs
Convention Center. Palm Springs has long been a favorite winter
vacation spot for Canadians.
   ``Sonny's going to work the booth, pump lots of flesh and
schmooze with planners _ people who plan conventions,'' city
spokeswoman Ann Erdman said. ``The purpose being to promote tourism
in Palm Springs and to line up conventions.''
   Bono's first big publicity trip was a jaunt to New York last
month, where he met with Mayor Edward I. Koch, appeared on
television and radio shows and attended another convention.
   Bono, a restaurant owner in his city, has worked 12-hour days or
longer at City Hall since he was elected mayor in April.

<TEXT>
   A strong earthquake occurred Sunday near the
coast of central Chile, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center
reported. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.
   The earthquake at 1:53 p.m. EDT registered 6.5 on the Richter
scale, but did not generate a Pacific-wide tsunami, or sea wave,
the center here said.
   The National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.,
said the quake was felt strongly in Caldera, Chile, about 400 miles
north of Santiago, capital of the South American country.
   The magnitude was the largest recorded in that general area
since a quake measuring 7.3 occurred Oct. 4, 1983.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 6.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 5.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter
scale.

   President Reagan lauded his loyal vice
president for ``strength, vision and true grit'' Sunday as he
arrived in a Republican National Convention city where speculation
swirled endlessly about George Bush's choice of a running mate.
   ``The masquerade is over. It's time to talk issues; to use the
dreaded `L' word, to say the policies of our opposition and the
congressional leadership of his party are liberal, liberal,
liberal,'' Reagan said in prepared remarks for a campaign rally a
few blocks from the New Orleans convention hall.
   Bush was at home in Washington, his nomination set for next
Wednesday night, satisfied to let Reagan start the ball rolling on
a week worth of Dukakis-bashing.
   Talk of a running mate dominated the political discussion in the
sweltering city, and many of the contenders made the rounds of the
morning talk shows before plunging into another day of
pre-convention receptions.
   Sen. Bob Dole put in a plug for his wife, Elizabeth, and
insisted despite evidence to the contrary that he wasn't
campaigning for the post himself. Sen. Alan Simpson described
himself as ``a liability'' and asked Bush to tap Dole _ Bob, that
is. Sen. Dan Quayle expressed the hope that he might be
``acceptable to the whole party.''
   Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, sworn in only Friday,
sounded ready to swap jobs. ``I have a job to do for this president
and until I've heard anything from the vice president, I'm ready to
go to work as attorney general,'' he said.
   A chain link security fence sprang up overnight around the
Superdome, one more strand in the web of security at the hall where
Republicans will spend four days praising extolling Bush and aiming
barbs at Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis.
   Inside, in one of the hundreds of rooms that ring the vast
convention floor, a squad of Republican speechwriters reviewed
scripts submitted by dozens of speakers to make sure they would fit
within the allotted time.
   Dukakis was on Cape Cod, while running mate Lloyd Bentsen
resumed a campaign tour of Texas. Bentsen has generally avoided
mentioning fellow Texan Bush by name, and he told reporters, ``I'm
trying to make the issues and pound on them and that's what I'm
trying to do.''
   The pre-convention weekend approximated an endless, moveable
party, from a Mississippi River dinner cruise for the Yankees from
New Hampshire to an extravagant bash for 5,000 guests hosted by the
city's newspaper, the Times-Picayune.
   ``We're party animals! Right!'' shouted Eduardo Castellou-Vogel,
one of the 700 volunteers recruited to make sure delegates arriving
at the New Orleans airport were in the proper frame of mind.
   ``It's the heart of the Big Easy,'' explained Nita Minter, over
from Slidell, La., for the festivities.
   Reagan's appearance at the downtown rally was one of two
speeches on his New Orleans schedule. His remarks to the delegates
Monday night were set up as the highlight of the opening session of
the convention.
   The president and Bush will meet only briefly Tuesday morning
before the president leaves town in a carefully choreographed
sequence designed to show Bush emerging as the new leader of the
Republican party.
   In his remarks to Republicans in gathered a few blocks from the
Superdome, Reagan ripped into the Democrats.
   ``The party of `yes' has become the party of `no,''' said
Reagan, who was a Democrat until 1962.
   The president accused the Democrats of saying `no' to holding
the line on taxes, to spending cuts and on other issues ranging
from the death penalty to the school prayer amendment. The
televised interviews added little or nothing to the sum of
knowledge about the only mystery of the Republican convention week,
and Bush said nothing to help.
   He had lunch at his official residence in Washington with James
Baker III, his top campaign adviser, then worked on his acceptance
speech with Roger Ailes, his media consultant and debate coach.
   Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, said the ``necessary work''
had been completed on eight to 10 vice presidential candidates in
advance of Bush's pick, although he declined to be drawn into a
discussion of any of them.
   ``He will make a selection that this convention will ratify
heartily,'' said Lee Atwater, Bush's combative campaign manager.
   There was no doubt about that, especially since the vice
president commanded the loyalty of all but a few dozen delegates
pledged to former television evangelist Pat Robertson.
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, less defiant than last week, pledged to
support the vice president's selection but still warned of a
``conservative gap'' if Bush didn't make a right-minded pick. ``We
want a flesh and blood conservative,'' he said on ABC's ``This Week
with David Brinkley.''
   Sen. Lowell Weicker voiced a rebuttal, calling Bush a ``moderate
conservative'' who does not share all the views of the far right.
``They've saddled him with a platform that as far as I'm concerned,
you can pour bacmk in the horse.''
   Simpson of Wyoming said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that he has
asked Bush not to consider him for the ticket. ``I've had a very
checkered career,'' said the No. 2 man in the Republican Party in
the Senate. ``I've punched the lights out of a lot of sacred
cows...I would be a liability for George.''
   The plusses and minuses about the contenders was easy to figure.
   One party source said Kansas Sen. Dole, popular in a region
where Bush ran poorly in the primaries, was lobbying strongly
behind the scenes for the job, and had relayed assurances that he
would toe the line that Bush's handlers would lay down for him. But
one Bush aide said opposition within the camp was strong, largely
because of Dole's penchant for cutting remarks, such as his demand
that Bush ``stop lying about my record'' during the primary
campaign.
   ``Did I say that?'' Dole deadpanned on Sunday. As for possible
opposition from Humphrey, he said, ``Sen. Humphrey's influence is
not widespread.''
   Quayle of Indiana, just 41 years old, said on ABC that he would
``like to believe that I would be acceptable to the whole party.''

<HEAD>NEA President Sees Common Ground Between Union, GOP</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The president of the National Education
Association, spurned by George Bush and other Republican
candidates, said Sunday she sees ``a broad common ground'' between
her union and the GOP.
   Mary Hatwood Futrell, in a pep talk to the small group of NEA
members who are Republican delegates, expresed chagrin that the
vice president did not seek the NEA's endorsement nor grant her
request for a private meeting.
   Bush was not alone. Most of Bush's former rivals also declined
to fill out the NEA's political questionnaires or sit for a
videotaped interview by Futrell.
   The union has been an ardent backer of the Democratic candidate
in every election since 1976, and an implacable foe of the
education and budget policies of the Reagan-Bush administration.
   Calling hers ``a bipartisan organization,'' Futrell said, ``I
believe that there is a broad common ground between NEA and the
Republican Party.''
   She said the NEA supports the GOP's calls for high standards and
improved accountability for schools, teachers and students; for a
greater emphasis on religious and moral values; and for more
attention to the needs of disadvantaged students.
   She didn't mention some other GOP platform positions _ including
support for merit pay, tuition tax credits and home schooling _
that her union opposes.
   The NEA endorsed Michael Dukakis for the Democratic presidential
nomination a few weeks before the Democratic convention. It is
waiting until Sept. 8 to make a formal endorsement for the general
election, after canvassing the 8,400 NEA delegates who attended its
convention here last month.
   The NEA, which boasted nearly 300 Democratic delegates and 92
alternates in Atlanta, has 25 of its members among the GOP
delegates, plus nine alternates, according to a preliminary tally.
   The 1.9 million-member union, which estimates that 600,000 of
its members are Republicans, is giving each delegate $1,000 to
defray convention expenses.

   A small group of United Nations military
observers left for the front Sunday to prepare for the U.N.
peacekeeping force that will monitor a cease-fire in the war
between Iran and Iraq.
   The team from the U.N. Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group was
expected to return to the Iranian capital Monday after checking
logistical needs for the peacekeepers.
   A diplomatic source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the location of the border is not expected to cause major
negotiating problems. The U.N. observers' ``primary job will be to
make sure that no one violates the truce,'' the source said.
   Forces of both countries are now positioned along the border as
hammered out in a 1975 treaty. Iran wants the cease-fire agreement
to be based on that treaty, the Algiers Accords, which gave them
half of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway.
   Iraq has repudiated that agreement, and the struggle for control
over the waterway helped start the fighting in September 1980. The
Shatt-al-Arab, the delta of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, is
Iraq's only outlet to the sea at the Persian Gulf.
   Iran on July 18 accepted a U.N. cease-fire resolution that Iraq
accepted soon after it was passed in July 1987. The cease-fire is
to begin officially on Aug. 20.
   U.N. Resolution 598 said the U.N. force is to ``to verify,
confirm, and supervise the cease-fire and withdrawal'' to
``internationally recognized borders.''
   An informed source who spoke on condition of anonymity said
Turkish, Finnish and Swedish representatives are expected to join
the U.N. advance team on Monday. Military representatives from
Austria, Denmark, Canada and Australia are already in Iran.
   A similar team is working in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad.
   The advance team is laying groundwork for a 350-member unarmed
U.N. peacekeeping force to monitor the border while the two
countries hold direct talks, set to begin Aug. 25.
   In Baghdad, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said Sunday his
nation forced Iran into agreeing to a truce by defeating it on the
battlefield.
   He also called on his people to redouble efforts to rebuild
post-war Iraq.
   ``The decision of peace was taken by Iraq and not by Iran, nor
by the (U.N.) secretary-general (Javier Perez de Cuellar),''
Hussein told his Cabinet in an address shown on state-run
television.
   ``We believed right from the beginning that peace could not be
achieved unless Iraq wins the battle,'' he said. ``And Iraq won the
battle when it rendered Iran incapable of continuing the war.''
   Iran's acceptance of the cease-fire followed defeats by Iraqi
troops, who recaptured the Faw peninsula, the Majnoon islands and
land near the southern port city of Basra.
   In a related development, Tehran Radio quoted Iranian President
Ali Khamenei as saying Sunday that Iran would not accept any
alterations in Resolution 598.
   ``It is possible that the aggressor enemy, which follows no
principle, will try to change the U.N. resolution. But we insist
that we will not accept any change in the articles of the
resolution, not even a word,'' he said.
   The president spoke to a group of troops manning anti-aircraft
batteries along the southern front. Khamenei told the troops that
despite the expected end of the war, they should remain alert.

   Several Soviets who floated down the
Mississippi River on a cruise for peace were invited to help
Republicans welcome President Reagan to the GOP convention Sunday.
   Forty-eight Soviets and 125 Americans rode the Delta Queen
paddlewheeler from St. Louis to New Orleans on a nine-day
Mississippi Peace Cruise. The Republican Party gave the group
tickets for 15 of the Soviet participants to attend a rally for
Reagan at the Superdome.
   ``The Republican Party's assessment of its record and
relationship with the Soviets should be good because there have
been substantial achievements,'' said Yuri Drozdov as he left the
steamboat. ``Now my main interest is, how does the party see the
future?''
   Drozdov, a researcher of nuclear disarmament in Asia and the
Pacific, said he was eager to watch the convention delegates'
``self-expression'' at what he expected to be an emotional,
spirited gathering.
   ``We, too, have our self-expression, but this is a curious
thing,'' he said.
   The Soviets ate lunch at Chez Helene, a soul food restaurant
that's the model for television's ``Frank's Place.'' They were
staying in the rollicking French Quarter, and Alice and Howard
Frazier of Woodmont, Conn., who organized the peace cruise, said
they expected a full night of indulgence.
   ``They are a fun-loving group. We probably won't be able to get
them back to the hotel,'' Alice Frazier said.
   On the river cruise, the Soviets, all members of peace
committees in 11 of the 15 Soviet republics, and Americans
participated in daily workshops on nuclear disarmament, democracy
and glasnost.
   ``We learned a lot about each other,'' said Alice Coleman of
Denver. ``We're really not so different. They love Mark Twain, he's
their favorite American author. They hate Rambo. They like Elvis
Presley.''
   A similar peace cruise was held on the Mississippi in 1986, and
cruises have been held on the Soviet Union's Volga River since
1982, organizers said.

<TEXT>
   Drought-plagued farmers in search of
livestock feed are turning to cannery waste and used grains from
breweries in increasing numbers.
   ``This year we have waiting lists for customers, are totally
sold out and even had to trim our customer list,'' said Larry
Johnson, who works for Miracle Feeds Inc.'s office in Onalaska in
western Wisconsin.
   The feed company hauls malted barley and corn grits from brewery
plants and stores the perishable grain before delivery to farmers,
Johnson said Friday.
   The cooked malted grain and cannery wastes _ sweet corn husks
and cobs and bean and pea plant ends _ can be fed to cows by
farmers trying to cut their bills for corn and other grains.
   Johnson said the used grain is cheaper _ about $20 a ton _ than
some other feeds with similar nutrition. Used brewery grain may
have between 24 percent and 32 percent crude protein when dry, he
said.
   ``It's a really good feed,'' said Kenneth Shibilski, president
of Stevens Point Brewery in Stevens Point, which also has been
getting calls from farmers looking for wet grain.
   Last week, agriculture officials released harvest forecasts
predicting Wisconsin's corn harvest would be down 52 percent
compared with last year and oats will be down 60 percent.
   With smaller harvests and higher grain prices, there also seems
to be more interest in vegetable processing waste, said Milo Olson,
Polk County agriculture agent.
   ``I have several farmers now feeding potato waste,'' he said.
``They (farmers) are looking for more ways to get through'' the
drought.
   Before rains turned Wisconsin fields green in the past few weeks
and raised hopes for a third hay cutting, cannery operators said
they noticed an increase in the number of farmers asking about
bean, corn and pea waste.
   ``There's a lot more interest in it than there's been in the
past,'' said Jack Campbell, with Del Monte operations in Plover,
where waste is available free.
   Some canneries, like Stokely USA's Sun Prairie operations, have
contracts with farmers who take the waste away from the cannery.
   ``One year, you can't give the stuff away and other years,
you've got people fighting for it,'' said Tom Mangus, raw products
manager for Stokely.

   A PLO delegation ended three days of talks
with Jordanian leaders Sunday and officials said they agreed that
Jordan would take no further measures to abolish its influence in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization also reasserted its desire
for confederation with Jordan after a Palestinian state has been
established.
   A senior Palestinian leader was quoted in a Paris-based weekly
as saying the PLO is leaning toward establishing a provisional
government in the Israeli-occupied territories instead of a
government-in-exile.
   The newspaper Journal du Dimanche quoted Salah Khalaf, deputy
chairman of PLO chief Yasser Arafat's Fatah wing, as saying in an
interview that the decision on a provisional government might be
taken at a meeting next month of the Palestine National Council,
the organization's legislature.
   The Amman meetings were the first high-level discussions between
Jordanian and PLO officials since King Hussein's decision two weeks
ago to renounce Jordan's claim to sovereignty over the West Bank of
the Jordan River.
   Hussein also canceled a $1.3 billion West Bank development plan,
ended payments to thousands of civil servants in the occupied
territories and suspended the lower chamber of Jordan's parliament.
Half of the members of the lower House were from the West Bank.
   The king said he was turning over to the PLO full responsibility
for the occupied territories.
   But a PLO statement issued Sunday night in Amman indicated the
PLO did not want further Jordanian moves to remove its influence in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, captured by Israel from Jordan and
Egypt in the 1967 Middle East War.
   The statement said ``both sides came to agreement that Jordan
will provide all facilities and measures that serve the interests
and the life of our people in the occupied territories.''
   PLO Executive Committee member Abdullah Horani told reporters
Sunday night that Jordan will continue to keep open the Jordan
River bridges to the West Bank, will continue to issue Jordanian
passports to West Bank residents and will maintain its oversight of
West Bank schools.
   Most of the 850,000 Palestinians in the West Bank and many of
the 650,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip hold Jordanian
passports. A majority of the 2.8 million residents of Jordan are
from families who fled from Palestine in the 1948 and 1967 wars
with Israel.
   The PLO statement said Jordan made clear that people of
Palestinian origin ``have full rights of citizenship'' but also
would retain ``their rights in Palestine ... including the right to
repatriation and self-determination.''
   Referring indirectly to tensions caused by Hussein's break with
the West Bank, the PLO said it ``expressed deep concern for the
stability of Jordan and its national unity.''
   It restated its call for an eventual Palestinian confederation
with Jordan. Horani said said that would occur only after a
Palestinian state ``is established on the ground.''
   Palestinian officials here confirmed the statements by Khalaf
that creation of a provisional government might be considered by
the Palestine National Council.
   Horani said no date for the council session has been set,
although it is supposed to be held this month or early next month
in Algiers.
   Palestinian leaders have suggested a provisional government
would strengthen their indirect recognition of Israel's right to
exist, but Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel has rejected the
idea of talks with any such government.
   Israel also has said it would not permit the formation of a
Palestinian state in the occupied territories.
   ``For 25 years, the Arabs refused to talk peace with Israel, and
now it's Israel which says `No,''' Khalaf told the Journal du
Dimanche.
   ``My solution for peace is a Palestinian state, a discussion to
establish the borders of this state and mutual recognition of
Israel and Palestine,'' he was quoted as saying.
   He said the PLO was ``thinking seriously of creating a
Palestinian state with a provisional government, legitimately
established, whose political program would be completely different
from the PLO's current charter.''
   That charter has been a major block to American and Israeli
talks with the PLO because it calls for the elimination of Israel.

   Rain was scattered over parts of the eastern third of the nation
Sunday, and while the heat wave continued with more high
temperature records broken, thermometers took a dive in Maine and
the Northwest.
   A very unstable air mass over sections of New England and New
York state set off strong thunderstorms, which generated high wind
that knocked out all communications in the town of Raymond, in
southern New Hampshire, the National Weather Service said.
   A band of showers and thunderstorms reached across Indiana and
western Kentucky and Tennessee to northwestern Mississippi.
   Along the southern Atlantic Coast, the remnants of a tropical
depression helped spread rain and thunderstorms from eastern
sections of the Carolinas across southeastern Georgia to northern
Florida. Jacksonville, Fla., got 3.17 inches of rain in the 24
hours up to 8 a.m., the weather service said.
   The southern Plains sweltered and by 2 p.m. CDT the temperature
had hit 104 at Russell and Hill City in Kansas and Altus Air Force
Base, Okla.
   Farther north, Milwaukee hit 90 degrees or higher for the 34th
time this summer, a record hot streak; the former record of 33 days
was set in 1955.
   Even Lake Erie set a record, with the water reaching a
temperature of 80 degrees Sunday morning at Buffalo, N.Y., the
warmest since record keeping began in 1926.
   Other record highs Sunday were 91 at Beckley, W.Va., the city's
fifth record in a row; 93 at Madison, Wis.; and 96 at Syracuse,
N.Y. Records were tied at Cape Hatteras, N.C., at 90; Dayton, Ohio,
at 95; Des Moines, Iowa, at 100; and Philadelphia at 94.
   A cold front brought relief to Maine, where temperatures were
mostly in the 60s and 70s Sunday afternoon. Portland reached 80
degrees, the 14th day in a row, edging a record of 13 days set in
July 1980, and then dropped to 69 degrees by 3 p.m.
   Residents of the Pacific Northwest have had several days of cool
weather. Temperatures across western Washington and western Oregon
dropped into the 40s and lower 50s Sunday morning.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 57
degrees at Arcata, Calif., to 106 at Phoenix, Ariz. The nation's
low Sunday morning was 29 at Truckee, Calif.
   For Monday, showers and thunderstorms were forecast from New
England to the upper Ohio Valley and central Appalachians, and from
the southern Atlantic and Gulf coast states to southeastern Texas.
Widely scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast from
northern Michigan to eastern North Dakota, over most of Montana,
and from southwestern Texas to eastern Arizona.
   Highs in the 70s were predicted in northern Maine, the Pacific
Northwest and along the Pacific Coast; in the 80s from northern
Minnesota to Michigan and across New York and northern New England,
and over sections of the West between the Rockies and the Sierras;
over 100 across the Plains with some readings near 110 in South
Dakota and Nebraska; between 100 and 110 in the desert Southwest;
and in the 90s across most of the rest of the nation.

   It is Sunday morning on the day before the
Republican National Convention and in the cool confines of the
Cathedral of St. Louis, the Rev. Frank Montalbano invokes God's
blessing for the coming gathering in the Superdome.
   ``We want to thank you for joining us from everywhere,'' says
Montalbano. ``Don't wait for the next Republican convention to come
and see us.''
   He judiciously avoids anything that might be construed as
partisan. ``Catholics are from everywhere,'' he says. ``That's what
being Catholic is about.''
   The cathedral, the oldest in America, is on Jackson Square in
the French Quarter. The square is marked with a new sign declaring
it ``Place Jean Paul Deux,'' a reminder that the pope worshipped
there during his visit last year.
   In fact, there is a kneeler on the left side of the altar used
by John Paul II and no one else.
   Outside the cathedral, Dr. Love is hanging his paintings on the
iron fence enclosing the park on Jackson Square. Each painting uses
the word ``Love'' in some manner: in the shape of buildings, of
shrubbery, as geometric shapes. He is hoping Republicans will find
the message appealing.
   His best seller, he says, is a painting that spells the word
right side up or upside down, in blue for males and pink for
females. The painting is hung so it will rotate easily and Dr. Love
_ he's really M.T. Hol-U-Bar _ explains a complicated ritual for
which side is up that sends a message from one partner to the other.
   Sideways, he says, is a symbol of neutrality which is usually
the way he feels about political parties, except of course this
week.
   In New Orleans, this week, everybody loves the Republicans.
Cabdrivers love them, restaurant owners love them, and shopkeepers
love them. There is even nostalgia for a Republican reviled in the
past. A popular T-shirt bears the legend ``Tanned, Rested and
Ready: Nixon in '88.''
   A man who sculptures balloons, who says his name is simply
``Clown'' when he is at work, is specializing this week in elephant
trunks. ``What does everybody from Washington have in common??'' he
asks. ``They have their nose in government.''
   It's only 9 a.m. but Jackson Square already is steamy.
Delegates, seemingly early risers, are strolling about. You can
tell that they are delegates because they already are wearing tags
around their necks, even though it's a day early.
   The painters who display their wares against the Jackson Square
fence every day are in the spirit of the week. One has a portrait
of Ronald Reagan in a gallery that also includes Cory Aquino.
Another displays one of George Bush, looking as he did about 20
years ago.
   In the sun-splashed Cafe du Monde, Republicans from out of town
are performing a delectable New Orleans ritual, drinking chicory
coffee and eating beignets _ those square, sugar-powdered
confections that compare to doughnuts as steak does to meat loaf.
   Outside two sidewalk musicians are entertaining. On the trombone
one plays a jazz rendition of ``Let Me Call You Sweetheart.''
   It seems an appropriate New Orleans serenade to their visitors.

   Israel closed the Gaza Strip and confined
residents to their homes Sunday after widespread rioting in the
occupied lands. Arab sources said 25 Palestinians were wounded and
Israel said a firebomb thrown at a van burned six Israelis,
including an infant.
   The wounded Israelis were among several families traveling to
visit relatives at the Jewish settlement of Neve Dekalim in the
Gaza Strip, said Menachem Beit-Halachmi, spokesman for the Gush
Katif Jewish settlement council.
   As the van passed the strip's Bureij refugee camp, one of a
group of Arabs hurled a bottle filled with gasoline that broke
through the vehicle's windshield, he said.
   An 8-month-old child was in critical condition with facial
burns, Israel radio said. It said three children ages 2, 8, and 11,
and a teen-ager and an adult received light to moderate injures.
   Troops sealed the area and searched for suspects, the radio said.
   ``We had a meeting with the army tonight, and they promised to
take a series of tough actions,'' Beit-Halachmi said.
   Also Sunday, the army said a 21-year-old Gaza man died of wounds
sustained during the weekend. The death brings to 243 the number of
Arabs killed since the Palestinian uprising began Dec. 8. Four
Israelis also have died.
   The army's curfew on the Gaza Strip means all 650,000 residents
of Gaza will be confined to their homes indefinitely, a military
spokesman said.
   Residents will be barred from traveling to jobs in Israel, and
journalists will be allowed into the area only if accompanied by a
military official, the army said.
   It was the second time the entire Gaza Strip had been placed
under curfew since the Palestinian revolt began. The army took a
similar measure in March.
   Shopkeepers in the seaside strip opened their stores just after
8:30 p.m., enabling residents to stock up on food before the 10
p.m., when the curfew went into effect.
   The riots in Gaza apparently were triggered by the deaths of two
Gazan workers who were burned while sleeping at an Israeli
construction site near Tel Aviv last week, local reporters said.
Police have said Jewish extremists may have set the fire.
   Troops shot and wounded at least 21 Palestinians in Gaza and
four in the West Bank, Arab reporters said. The overall number was
confirmed by hospital officials. The reporters said a 48-year-old
Gaza City man lost an eye when he was hit by a rubber bullet.
   An army spokesman said he did not know of the eye injury and put
the number of wounded at 13.
   The army announced the curfew after closing most of the
140-square-mile strip to outside visitors and restricting at least
187,000 residents to their homes throughout the day. Journalists
were forced to leave the area, Israel radio said.
   ``The curfew is to remain into effect until further notice,''
the army announcement said. ``Residents will not be allowed to
enter Israel, and residents coming back from work will be allowed
to enter the Gaza Strip only at hours set by the military
government.''
   At least half of Gaza's residents commute daily to jobs in
Israeli restaurants, factories and farms.
   `The date at which the Gaza Strip will be reopened to traffic
will be decided upon according to circumstances,'' the army said.
   The statement said the measure was taken ``to undermine
residents' readiness to respond to calls to engage in public
disorder.''
   Underground leaflets from Moslem fundamentalist groups called
for demonstrations to coincide with the Islamic new year, 1409, and
Israeli officials said they expected a new wave of unrest.
   Six of the shootings in Gaza took place in the Jabaliya refugee
camp on the outskirts of Gaza City. Two of those wounded were
18-year-olds who suffered gunshot wounds in the arms or legs, said
officials at Al Ahli Arab and Shifa Hospitals.
   Other injuries occurred in the Shati refugee camp and the Sheikh
Radwan and Tufah neighborhoods of Gaza City, said the officials,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Dowsers Say Drought Hasn't Brought Them Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EFFINGHAM, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The drought hasn't flooded dowsers with
work, and some say it's because people are skeptical of their
powers to find water.
   ``I haven't had any calls and I'm surprised,'' said Dugie Kane,
42, one of 65 people who attended the Illianna Dowsers convention
Saturday.
   Kane, an 18-year veteran of dowsing, and his fellow dowsers
believe their skills help them find underground water, oil and
other resources. Some also say they use dowsing for healing
purposes.
   Some dowsers, who are sometimes called ``water witches,'' use
pendulums, while others use reeds or forked branches. Still others
say they have become so practiced at dowsing they can tell where
water is without using an instrument.
   Kane said doubts about their powers may keep some people away.
   ``A lot of people aren't going to call because of that reason,''
said Kane, of Edwardsville, near St. Louis. ``But common sense
tells me if I need water and someone can help, I'm going to take a
shot at it. Right now I think a lot of people are afraid it's going
to cost them too much to drill a well.''
   Dowser Dale Bingham, 72, of nearby Vandalia, agreed price may
keep people away. He said drilling a well can cost a minimum of
several thousand dollars. Bingham, however, says he has watched
farmers come to Vandalia's water treatment plant this summer to
haul water with their trucks.
   ``For them to haul water is unnecessary because there is water
on their land,'' Bingham said. ``But a dowser will never push
himself on anyone.''
   Bingham said has dowsed thousands of wells in 40 years, and said
he has been wrong only once. Bingham and Kane don't charge for
their water-searching services.
   ``If you want to have a well, call in a well driller and have
them dig it. But if you want water in that well, you better put it
where there's water,'' Bingham said.

   Heavy rains pushed the two main branches
of the Nile River over their banks Sunday, swamping huge sections
of central Sudan and worsening a disaster that already has left 2
million people homeless, news reports said.
   The reports said the Blue Nile and White Nile, which converge at
Khartoum to form the Nile, were overflowing Sunday south of this
capital city.
   Finance Minister Omar Nour el-Dayem told reporters Saturday the
floods have killed at least 58 people, injured 213 and destroyed
167,000 houses in the Khartoum area.
   Irrigation Minister Mahmoud Beshir Gamma said damage was
expected to extend from central and northern Sudan into Egyptian
territory.
   An Egyptian newspaper al-Ahram, in a dispatch from Khartoum,
said in its Monday editions that the two Nile tributaries on Sunday
spilled across a region south of Khartoum ``until only tree tops
remained visible.''
   The El-Gezira district, in central Sudan between the two
branches of the Nile, is one of the country's richest agricultural
zones. It produces cotton, a leading export, and a loss of the crop
could prove disastrous Sudan's already faltering economy.
   For the past 10 days Khartoum and other cities in central,
eastern and northern Sudan have suffered floods caused by heavy
rains that officials said are the worst in the country's history.
   More than 1,200 tons of relief supplies, including tents,
medicine and food, have arrived in Khartoum from donors worldwide,
but Nour el-Dayem told a news conference in Khartoum the aid is
insufficient for the millions affected by the floods.
   Richard Mosovy, a member of the committee coordinating the
relief operation, denied reports that aid was being withheld from
some 750,000 people who fled the civil war and drought in southern
Sundan and moved into squatter camps that ring Khartoum.
   ``It just so happens that those living in outlying areas are
inaccessible to those distributing food,'' Mosovy told reporters.
   Some journalists have said they saw no evidence of aid being
distributed in the camps and there were reports of some supplies
being diverted to the army. Nour el-Dayem denied that and said
``the army is giving its supplies to the people.''
   Intestinal infections and diarrhea epidemics have broken out in
many settlements from people drinking unclean water, the World
Health Organization's representative told international relief
agencies Saturday.
   Dr. Nicholas Ward said cholera was an immediate risk, with
outbreaks of malaria and typhoid expected within weeks.
   The U.N. Emergency Office in Khartoum said more rains were
forecast through August and into September.

   A series of earthquakes, the largest
measuring 5.6 on the Richter scale, shook central Utah and western
Colorado Sunday afternoon, but there were no reports of injuries or
major property damage.
   A small quake measuring 3.5 on the Richter scale occurred at
12:59 p.m., followed at 1:08 p.m. by a moderate jolt measuring 4.3,
said the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information
Center in Golden, Colo.
   A moderate-to-strong quake measuring 5.6 on the Richter scale
occurred at 2:03 p.m., the center said.
   The quakes, centered 34 miles south of Price, were reportedly
felt there and in communities throughout central Utah, including
Manti, Ephraim and Delta. Price is about 120 miles south of Salt
Lake City.
   There were reports of minor ground-shaking as far north as
southern Salt Lake County and as far east as Golden, authorities
said.
   The U.S. Forest Service said a quake-triggered rockslide closed
a road near Price. In the town, police said cans shook off shelves,
but there was no major property damage.

   Osman Geragandi Koko looked at the mounds
of mud above the surface of water covering the flooded shanty town
of Jebel Kusha _Arabic for ``mountain of garbage.''
   ``Seven thousand families lived where there now is water,'' said
Koko, 32, a squatter in the northern Khartoum settlement of Jebel
Kusha. ``The government has brought no relief.''
   The muddy mounds are all that remain of thousands of hovels
destroyed since torrential rains began in central Sudan on Aug. 4,
leaving the desert capital of Khartoum awash and sending the White
Nile and Blue Nile rivers over their banks.
   Government officials have said 58 people have perished in the
floods that destroyed some 167,000 houses and left up to 2 million
people homeless.
   Authorities acknowledge that little has been accomplished so far
in providing aid to the victims, but they blame insufficient
supplies and the suddenness and scope of the catastrophe.
   ``In a matter of hours, towns and millions of people were
submerged,'' Omer El Din, head of the National Flood Emergency
Committee, said Saturday.
   Jebel Kusha was among the areas hardest hit.
   It is one of 23 squatter camps ringing Khartoum that hold an
estimated 500,000 people who fled the civil war and drought in
southern Sudan and sought refuge in the capital.
   Many of the mud huts in Jebel Kusha disintegrated under the
rains, and the floods created a lake with knee-high waters that
extends for more than a half mile from the settlement to the
village of Esba.
   Women and children with plastic jugs and containers waded
through the muddy lake to get to Esba where they begged for clean
water.
   ``We have been suffering for the last 10 days,'' said Koko,
acting as a spokesman for the 15,000 people at Jebel Kusha.
``Nobody has come. We are sick, we are hungry,'' he told a group of
visiting journalists.
   El Din said relief would be provided for the refugees but
supplies received so far met only a fraction of the need and were
quickly used up.
   As of Saturday, 85 cargo planes mainly from Arab and Western
nations had delivered 1,200 tons of emergency supplies including
tents, blankets, medicine, four-wheel-drive vehicles and 400 tons
of food, according to relief officials.
   The United Nations estimates 12,000 tons of food is needed to
help feed the flood victims for a month. It is helping coordinate
the response by international relief agencies and there are reports
the catasrophe could get worse.
   More rain is forecast for this month and into September.

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Utah teen-ager who is one of youngest
delegates to the Republican National Convention says he hopes to
amend the party platform to reflect Mormon family values.
   Steve Densley, a freshman at Mormon Church-owned Brigham Young
University, wants a platform plank recommending that American
families meet together weekly to discuss moral issues such as
illicit drug use and avoiding sexually transmitted diseases such as
AIDS.
   At 18, Densley is the youngest of the 1,274 delegates surveyed
by The Associated Press. More than 2,200 delegates are gathered in
New Orleans for the convention, which opens Monday.
   The proposed plank would reflect a Mormon Church program known
as Family Home Evening, in which families are encouraged to get
together on Monday nights for various activities, including
religious instruction.
   Densley conceded that with the bulk of the platform work
completed, his prospects for success are slim. Densley said he
didn't think of his pro-family plank until after the committee
began its work last week.
   ``What all of these social, moral issues have is a common
starting point _ a lack of moral fiber,'' Densley said. ``What
could turn the country around is a stronger emphasis on the
family.''
   ``It's not a religious issue per se. It could work wonders
nationally,'' said Densley, the oldest of six children in a devout
Mormon family that adheres to the Family Home Evening program.
   Densley graduated from high school only last June, and spent the
summer in political science and pre-law at BYU.
   He said he ran for a spot in the Utah delegation to prove that
teen-agers can play a significant role in politics.

   About 30 youths hurled stones at an East German
bus Sunday as it carried passengers through West Berlin en route to
East Berlin's airport, police said.
   The attack on the government-owned bus followed a day of
commemorations on both sides of the city marking the 27th
anniversary of the Berlin Wall.
   West Berlin police said no one was injured but that several bus
windows were shattered.
   The bus, owned by the East German state airline Interflug, had
picked up passengers in West Berlin who were to take flights from
East Berlin's Schoenefeld airport, said a police spokesman,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Police were unable to catch the assailants, the spokesman said.
   On Saturday, protesters in West Berlin hurled rocks, bottles,
tomatoes, and eggs at East German soldiers stationed on the other
side of the wall.
   West Berlin police arrested four protesters. U.S. military
authorities arrested two others who burned an American flag, West
Berlin police said.
   No injuries were reported.
   On Saturday, West German newspapers marked the wall's
anniversary, saying it should not exist. Meanwhile, communist East
Germany's state-controlled newspapers celebrated its construction
and said it has contributed to East-West peace.
   East German border guards began hastily constructing the 13-foot
wall on Aug. 13, 1961, dividing the city into Eastern and Western
halves. Orders to construct the wall came as the rising flow of
East German refugees to the West threatened to cripple the
communist nation's economy.
   The August 13th Working Group, a West Berlin organization that
monitors human rights in East Germany, says 77 people have been
killed in escape attempts from East Berlin.
   Also Sunday, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl appealed to his
nation to help the growing number of German-heritage immigrants
arriving from the East bloc.
   Speaking on the ZDF television network, Kohl said it was
``shameful'' that some West Germans resent the newcomers.
   ``This is money well-spent,'' Kohl told an interviewer,
referring to the millions of dollars spent to resettle the
immigrants each year.
   Up to 200,000 German-stock people were expected to arrive in
West Germany from Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union this year,
compared to about 80,000 in 1987.
   The main reason for the increase is easing of immigration
restrictions by the Soviet Union and some other East bloc countries.

   President Reagan made his entrance at the
Republican National Convention Sunday riding in a Mardis Gras style
parade and pledging ``every ounce of energy and every fiber of my
being'' in support of George Bush for president.
   The president and his wife, Nancy, rode into the New Orleans
Convention Center in an open antique touring car, preceded by
marching bands, floats and an elephant.
   The crowd that jammed the convention center, standing on the
concrete floor to hear the president, interrupted his speech with
frequent cheers and applause.
   At the beginning of the speech the president was heckled from
the back of the hall by a handful of protesters. They were evicted
and their signs were taken down.
   Reagan spent much of his speech deriding the Democrats, whom he
said had become ``the party of `no.'''
   ``They know what they intend to do once in office,'' the
president said. ``But they don't want the American people to find
out until after the election.''
   ``The masquerade is over,'' he added. ``It's time to talk
issues, to use the dreaded `L' word, to say the policies of our
opposition and the congressional leadership of his party are
liberal, liberal, liberal.''
   ``The party of `yes' has become the party of `no,''' said
Reagan, who was a Democrat until 1962.
   ``Four more years, four more years,'' the crowd chanted as
Reagan walked onto the stage.
   Later, the Republicans chanted ``Bush, Bush Bush,'' as Reagan
got into his speech. He paused briefly, saying, ``That's right.
That's his name.''
   At the outset of his speech, he made several quips at the
Democrats' expense.
   Reagan said he had something in common with Democratic vice
presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen. Without naming Bentsen, he
said, ``neither one of us shares the views of their presidential
nominee.''
   Reagan also suggested he had something in common with Democratic
nominee Michael Dukakis, whom he referred to only as ``their
presidential nominee.''
   ``Come this January, neither one of us will be holding a federal
office,'' he said.
   Declaring that ``we never want to see the day when the Supreme
Court is more interested in criminal rights than in the rights of
the victim and society itself,'' Reagan predicted, ``The next
president may have the opportunity to appoint three and possibly
four new justices shortly after taking office.''
   On foreign affairs, he said, ``What a great moment we have
before us and oh how future generations will dishonor us if now in
a moment of sudden folly we throw it all away.''
   ``We must hold to this moment of hope _ and I tell you with
every ounce of energy and every fiber of my being, only electing
George Bush president of the United States can accomplish that.''
   ``My fellow Republicans, America needs the strength, vision and
true grit of George Bush.''
   The speech was a preview of the one Reagan will make in prime
time on opening night of the GOP convention Monday.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters on the
flight from Washington aboard Air Force One that the convention
speech ``will focus on successes'' of the administration, including
``the president's policies on arms control and military strength.''
   He said it will also contain ``some reminiscing.''
   On Tuesday morning the president will speak at a closed
breakfast for big contributors to the Republican Party.
   Bush, arriving that day to claim the party's nomination, will
cross paths with the president at Belle Chasse Naval Air Station.
After remarks by both men, the Reagans will be off to their
688-acre ranch in the Santa Ynez Mountains near Santa Barbara,
Calif., where Reagan has spent 316 days since becoming president.
   Reagan has been increasingly active on Bush's behalf as the
convention neared with the vice president still lagging behind
Democratic nominee Michael S. Dukakis in public opinion polls.
   On Thursday, the Reagans lunched with Bush and his wife,
Barbara, at the White House, and plans for the previously
unscheduled airport meeting in New Orleans were announced.
   On Friday, Reagan and Bush addressed Cabinet members and
political appointees, the president saying, ``Frankly, I don't
think the American people want to gamble their future on a blind
date.''
   In his weekly radio speech on Saturday, the president continued
to hammer at this theme, picturing Bush as a candidate with a
proven national record and saying of the Democrats, ``While they
talk, we deliver.''
   This will be Reagan's seventh Republican National Convention. He
has attended every one since he switched his registration from
Democratic in 1962.
   At the 1964 convention in San Francisco, he was an alternate
delegate from California. After Barry Goldwater won the nomination,
Reagan campaigned for him with a strongly conservative speech that
was his introduction to the national political arena.
   He first addressed a Republican convention in Miami Beach, Fla.,
in 1968, when Richard Nixon was nominated. When Nixon was
renominated in Miami Beach four years later, Reagan presided over
the convention. He has addressed every GOP convention since then,
telling delegates in Dallas in 1984 that this was ``the last time''
he would address such a gathering as a candidate.

   Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis ended a weekend vacation on Cape Cod on Sunday by attending
a Boston Pops concert conducted by his wife's father.
   Dukakis, who spent Friday and Saturday nights on the Cape,
returned to his Brookline home Sunday night and was to visit
central Massachusetts on Monday and Tuesday.
   The Massachusetts governor walked past reporters as he arrived
at the outdoor concert in Hyannis. Dukakis was asked whether he had
anything he wanted to say on the eve of the Republican National
Convention but avoided the subject.
   ``This is going to be a great concert and we're going to enjoy
it,'' Dukakis said. He sat at a table with his wife, Kitty, her
sister and brother-in-law and several friends.
   The ``Pops by the Sea'' concert, held on the town green, was
conducted by Mrs. Dukakis' father, Harry Ellis Dickson.
   Dukakis was to return to the campaign trail on Wednesday and
travel throughout the final days of the Republican convention,
ending the trip in Texas where he was to be joined by his running
mate, Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen.

   Orbiting space debris poses a threat to
spacecraft and should be eliminated, a National Aeronautics and
Space Administration scientist said Sunday.
   Donald Kessler, a project scientist at NASA's Johnson Space
Center, told an international conference exploring various forms of
space pollution that a particle could strike and damage a
spacecraft. The debris ranges in size from old non-functioning
satellites and rocket boosters to nuts and bolts from
disintegrating spacecraft.
   Kessler estimated that at least 48,000 objects one centimeter or
larger are in orbit about the Earth, but told a Colloquium of the
International Astronomical Union that the true number is probably
much higher.
   In June of 1983, a window of the space shuttle Challenger was
replaced after being struck by a piece of orbiting debris that
caused a small pit. Later, chemical analysis revealed the window
had been hit by a fleck of paint no larger than one
eight-thousandth of an inch in diameter.
   Kessler says such collisions involving the space shuttle are
rare because of the vehicle's low orbit and the relatively short
amount of time the shuttle spends in space. Longer space missions
will require additional protection.
   ``The problem gets to be more severe for something like the
space station, which is planned to be continuously there for 30
years,'' Kessler said.
   Shields are currently being designed to protect the crew from
debris about one centimeter in diameter -- the size of a marble.
   ``The shields weigh an extra 2,000 pounds per module. There are
six modules, so that's an extra 12,000 pounds of weight that are
having to be put into orbit because of the orbital debris
environment,'' Kessler said.
   A presidential directive now requires that American spacecraft
be designed to minimize the creation of space debris. Future rocket
boosters, said Kessler, will probably be designed to fall back to
Earth. Kessler estimated that redesigning boosters might increase
their cost by 10 to 20 percent.
   The U.S. is not alone in recognizing the growing danger of space
debris. Kessler said a 1986 explosion of a spent Ariane rocket
booster spewed 400 pieces of debris into orbit, an event that
``woke the European Space Agency up'' to the problem of orbital
debris.

   Secret Service agents and police combed the
vast Louisiana Superdome on Sunday to make sure it was safe and
bomb-free before delegates to the Republican Convention descended
on the arena.
   The Secret Service would say little about their role at the
convention, except that its agents' first priority is to protect
President Reagan and Vice President George Bush, who is to claim
the GOP presidential nomination this week.
   ``It's a tremendous task. There's a lot involved when you start
talking about securing places, examining sites and allocating
manpower,'' said Rich Adams, an agency spokesman.
   He declined to say how many agents have been assigned to the
convention.
   A major task was completed Sunday, when the Superdome was
evacuated for 1{ hours while agents and police with dogs checked
for explosives.
   Adams said part of the arena, such as rooms that are not being
used, were checked earlier, making the task easier.
   Secret Service agents also will keep an eye on convention
protests, which are being staged six blocks away.
   ``We have to closely monitor them in case they become unruly and
people start jumping fences,'' Adams said, referring to a
5,000-foot-long, 8-foot-high chain-link fence that was erected
around the Superdome for the convention.
   New Orleans Police Lt. Don Bell said work on the fence was
completed Sunday and that a total of 110 officers will work
eight-hour shifts around the clock during the convention.
   ``We're basically observers,'' Bell said. ``It's boring at
times, stressful at times and very interesting. We've never had a
close-up look at a convention like this before.''
   Crowd control is nothing new to the police department, which
must deal with up to 1 million visitors every year during the
raucous Mardi Gras celebration.
   At the entrances to the Superdome, police officers and Secret
Service agents will be stationed near X-ray machines and metal
detectors.
   Police also will do extra duty to direct traffic, and about 110
state troopers will help patrol the tavern- and hotel-lined streets
of the French Quarter, where many of the convention delegates are
staying.

   A peace activist broke a 63-day
liquid-only fast _ one day for each million dollars allegedly spent
on ``Rambo III'' _ by biting into a giant pizza with a pepperoni
peace sign and delivering it to Sylvester Stallone's door.
   Jerry Rubin, a Southern California campaigner against cinema
violence and war toys, didn't see Stallone but was more graciously
received Saturday than in a previous visit to a Stallone residence
when someone squirted him with water over a wall.
   The actor's housekeeper even obliged when Rubin needed to do a
retake of his stunt for TV cameras.
   Rubin's wife, Marissa, and two friends were on hand as the
activist went to Stallone's home and, with media watching,
presented the pizza to a housekeeper.
   When a television crew arrived late, Rubin went back to the door
and got his pizza back to re-enact the event. At one point, the
unwieldy, 3-foot-wide pizza slipped off its cardboard platter and
onto the concrete driveway.
   After his first bite in 63 days, Rubin said he was looking
forward ``to watching movies with popcorn again.''
   One of the placards carried by the group read, ``Sly, Give Pizza
A Chance.'' Rubin said he hoped his attempt at humor would open a
line of communication with Stallone and other makers of violent
films.
   ``We need to reach them to open up that dialogue because it has
gotten out of hand,'' he said. ``In 10 or 20 years from now we're
going to pay a sad price, because these films not only have a
negative effect on children but they have a negative effect on
everyone.''

<HEAD>IRA Praises Killing Of British Soldier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supporters of the Irish
Republican Army on Sunday hailed the killing of a British soldier
in Belgium as a sign of the IRA's strength.
   Martin McGuinness, vice-president of the outlawed IRA's legal
political wing, Sinn Fein, told a rally in Belfast:
   ``It shows the ability of the IRA to bring about a final victory
in Ireland. We saw the IRA battalions at work in Belgium as well as
Holland and Germany. They speak for us. They speak with one voice.''
   The IRA has claimed responsibility for killing Warrant Officer
1st Class Richard Michael Heakin, who was shot to death Friday
night as he drove his car to the ferry at Ostend, Belgium.
   In May, IRA guerrillas killed three British servicemen in West
Germany and Holland.
   The predominantly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to unite
Northern Ireland, a British province where Protestants outnumber
Catholics 3-2, with the mainly Catholic Republic of Ireland.
   McGuinness spoke at a rally marking the 17th anniversary of the
introduction of the British policy of interning guerrilla suspects
without trial. Britain abandoned the policy in 1975.
   Paul Murray, a member of the Irish Northern Aid Committee, a
U.S.-based support group for the IRA, pledged continued assistance.
   He told the rally, ``As long as you campaign against the British
then we in America will support you.''
   In London, Armed Forces Minister Archie Hamilton said
recommendations have been made on whether British servicemen should
continue to use special license plates. He did not say what the
recommendations were, but said they would be given urgent
consideration by the Defense Ministry.
   There have been demands that the special ``British Forces''
license plates for British servicemen be replaced by British plates
or plates from the country where they are serving.
   Heakin, based in Moenchen Bladbach, West Germany, was shot by
one of two men who approached his car when it stopped at a traffic
light in Ostend where he planned to take the ferry to England.
   Richard Livsey, a member of Parliament representing Heakin's
constituency in Wales, said the soldier ``had no chance in his
private car with British Forces number plates. The fact is that as
long as these number plates remain, British servicemen will be
sitting ducks to the IRA.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A computerized toilet seat that lowers
automatically, a talking smoke detector that tells people how to
escape fires and a new version of the old push lawnmower were among
250,000 products on display Sunday at the National Hardware Show.
   The hardware show _ with 3,000 exhibits covering an area the
size of 17 football fields _ is the biggest in its 43-year history
and the country's largest trade show, said manager Pat Dolson.
   About 70,000 retailers are expected to attend the four-day event
at Chicago's McCormick Place exposition center, she said.
   Biggest growth is among lawn and garden exhibitors, who are
taking 40 percent more space than at last year's show, she said.
   ``Do-it-yourself people are moving the home improvement industry
outdoors,'' said Ms. Dolson. ``It's a recreational thing for the
yuppie generation, and we see tremendous growth in this area.''
   Americans spent $17.4 billion on their lawns and gardens last
year, a 23 percent increase over 1986, she said.
   Lawn mowers on display ranged from top-of-the-line Volvos _ a
$5,000 riding lawnmower with four-wheel steering, from Swedish
maker Husqvarna _ to the more humble $69 push mowers made by
American Lawn Mowers of Shelbyville, Indiana.
   Teri McClain, a sale-representative for the family-owned
American firm, said the push mower has returned with sales up 47
percent in the past two years, after a lightweight 17-pound model
of the 50-year-old traditional design was introduced several years
ago.
   ``Joggers and people into aerobics can get a workout while
mowing the lawn,'' she said. ``It's the lawnmower for the new
lifestyle.''
   Other lawn and garden products on display at the four-day show
included solar-powered patio lights made by a New Jersey-based
company, Synergy Inc., and a nine-pound gas-powered set of hedge
trimmers made by HomeLite.
   William Farrell, executive director of the American Hardware
Manufacturers Association of Schaumburg, Ill., said
do-it-yourselfers spent $52 billion at hardware, home center and
building supply outlets last year, and the do-it-youself market is
expected to grow by 12 percent annually, to total $100 billion by
1990.
   Overall, products displayed at the show included the practical
and impractical, the humble and extravagant _ from high-tech
gadgets to the simple ironing board, step ladder and trash can.
   Joseph Sansonetti, chief executive officer of Pioneer
Manufacturing Inc. of St. Petersburg, Florida, has invented the
Vocalert, a computerized smoke detector that not only sounds an
alarm signal but can offer instructions in a calm, authoritative
voice.
   It has a built-in bilingual English-Spanish vocabulary of 100
words and phrases _ that can be programmed to tell people what to
do to escape _ such as ``stay calm'' or ``drop to the floor,''
depending on the intensity of the fire, which its sensors pick up.
   ``It has an intelligence to it and is good for situations in
which people are disoriented like children and the elderly,'' said
Sansonetti said. ``It's going to eliminate the confusion for
everyone.''
   Sansonetti said about 1.2 million units are being produced. The
product, which retails for $89.95, is being marketed by WHS Sales
Inc. of Clearwater, Fla., and should be in stores by mid-fall.
   Sometimes the efforts to build a better mousetrap yield mixed
success.
   Keith Chiu, director of Eletto Industries Inc., of Monterey
Park, Calif., said he spent four years developing the ``intelligent
computerized toilet seat.''
   With a push of the button, the seat can automatically lift up
and down, a fanning mechanism and charcoal filter removes odors,
the temperature can be adjusted to warm the seat. It flushes
automatically and self-cleans, and the seat lowers by itself after
a man uses it.
   Chiu said the product does eliminate some age-old conflicts
between men and women, but its retail price of $350 is discouraging
buyers.
   ``We've discovered that it's too expensive for people,'' he
said. ``At that price, I doubt if I'd buy it myself.''

<TEXT>
   If George Bush has made up his mind about a
vice presidential running mate, he's not even telling his family,
his eldest son said Sunday.
   ``Sphinx-like, I think, is the adjective describing him,'' said
George W. Bush, a Texas delegate to the Republican National
Convention.
   The vice president's wife, Barbara, says she doesn't even want
to know her husband's choice.
   Calling herself the ``world's worst secret keeper,'' Mrs. Bush
said she has asked her husband not tell her about his choice for a
running mate. ``I've kept secrets, but it's agony,'' she said.
``This time, I want to be surprised.''
   With Bush's nomination as the GOP presidential candidate having
been clinched for months, the only suspense in the pre-convention
proceedings has centered on who will be his choice for No. 2.
   But the younger George Bush, of Midland, said his father simply
hasn't told anyone yet.
   ``I was with him all day yesterday. He never answered the
question, which I kept asking: `Who's your choice?'''
   Bush also said he doubted whether the person selected will get
much notice.
   ``The minute you tell the nominee anything, it's over. He's (the
elder Bush) been in this game long enough to know that if you want
it out, you tell the nominee. If you don't want it out, you don't
tell anybody. That's the way he's going to play it.''

   Ex-Gov. Evan Mecham declared himself ``just
sort of a normal delegate from Arizona'' as he arrived here for the
Republican national convention, but the turmoil caused by his
prolonged recall and impeachment battle still made him the center
of attention at a Sunday reception.
   Other Arizona delegates said they hoped to unify behind George
Bush and forget the party's disarray at home.
   State Republicans ``didn't come here to expose the differences
within the Republican Party in Arizona,'' said state party chairman
Burton Kruglick.
   ``This is New Orleans. This is national,'' said delegate Tom
Camp of Phoenix. ``We've left anything that pertains to Arizona
back in Arizona.''
   Some Arizonans suggested Mecham, who was convicted of high
crimes and misdemeanors, might want to mend fences with his chief
rival in the state party, Sen. John McCain, who called for Mecham's
resignation in January. A few months ago, Mecham struck back,
saying McCain lacked honesty and integrity and was not qualified
for vice presidential consideration.
   On Sunday, however, the former governor said he would be in the
Superdome on Monday to hear McCain's address to the opening night
session. ``He's getting a good spotlight and I'm happy for him,''
Mecham said.
   U.S. Rep. Jon Kyl, who was among the congressmen who sought
Mecham's resignation in January but is not a delegate, suggested
some accommodation might be in order for the former governor.
   ``Obviously a person who has been as contentious as he has been
ought to be working to improve his relationships,'' Kyl said. ``But
he's his own man. I'm not going to give him advice.''
   Zane Smith, who helped lead Pat Robertson's campaign in Arizona,
predicted the state delegation would take a break this week from
the intraparty battle. Arizona could play a major part in the
growing conservative movement, he said, adding, ``If the infighting
continues, there won't be that opportunity.''

   George Bush guarded his vice presidential
deliberations Sunday, while one of his prospective running mates
said he didn't want the job and others acted like they were
auditioning for it.
   Bashing Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis was the
order of the day for Sens. Dan Quayle of Indiana and Bob Dole of
Kansas, and Rep. Jack Kemp of New York _ all on Bush's list of
potential vice presidents.
   Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, a close Bush friend who also was
on the list, said ``I would be a liability,'' and disclosed he had
asked the GOP nominee-to-be to drop him from consideration.
   But another name popped up again for consideration _ former
White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker. Republicans outside of the
campaign are urging Bush to take another look at the former Senate
leader, a source said.
   Bush was at the vice presidential residence in Washington and
keeping his own counsel on his deliberations on a running mate. He
had lunch with Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, who is slated
to take command of his presidential campaign, and worked on his
acceptance speech.
   Even top aides, who have conferred regularly with Bush,
disclaimed any knowledge of whether he was leaning toward one
prospect or another.
   ``He'll probably tell us maybe 10 minutes before you find out,''
campaign manager Lee Atwater told reporters in the Superdome, where
the Republican National Convention will convene on Monday.
   Atwater said there was no change in Bush's plan to keep his
choice a secret until Thursday morning. The convention will go
through the formality Wednesday night of naming Bush the GOP
presidential nominee.
   The names mentioned most frequently were Dole and his wife,
former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole, Kemp, Simpson,
Quayle, Attorney General Richard Thornburgh and Sen. Pete Domenici
of New Mexico.
   Former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, also among the
mentioned, was in the convention city for only a few hours to
address a meeting of GOP governors.
   Asked if he were on Bush's list, Alexander said, ``No one's told
me. If I'm on anyone's list, it's a list no one's told me about.''
He said he has had no communication from Bush or his aides about
the vice presidency.
   The Doles were guests of honor at a reception and they told
reporters that Bush aides asked both of them last week for
additional background information.
   Domenici and Quayle, late arrivals in New Orleans Sunday, were
immediately plunged into the running-mate maelstrom.
   ``I really am not out trying to get the job,'' Domenici told
reporters, adding he hasn't heard from the Bush campaign ``for
maybe a week ... My guess is that I'm really a long shot still.''
   ``There's not a dime's worth of difference'' philosophically
among the hopefuls, Quayle said. ``I think we'll just enjoy
ourselves and wait for the big announcement.''
   Thornburgh decided this weekend to come to the convention Monday
to be on hand for President Reagan's farewell speech that night.
   The selection of someone to fill the No. 2 spot on the ticket
was the only suspense at the convention and conservatives were
actively lobbying to get one of their own in that spot.
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire, appearing on the NBC show
``Meet the Press,'' said, ``If George Bush chooses some
establishment Republican as his running mate, we will have
something much worse than a gender gap, we will have a conservative
gap.''
   Humphrey expressed reservations about Simpson and Dole and said
the most acceptable people being talked about were Kemp and Quayle.
   But the New Hampshire senator also said that ``On Friday of next
week when all of this is settled, I'm going to be supporting the
ticket.''
   ``My record is just as conservative as Senator Humphrey's,''
said Dole when asked about the criticism of his record.
   ``Senator Humphrey's influence is not widespread,'' he added.
   Conservative opposition to Simpson was based on the Wyoming
senator's positions on abortion and taxes.
   ``I've had a very checkered career,'' said Simpson, during an
interview on ``Meet the Press.'' ``I've punched the lights out of a
lot of sacred cows. ... I would be a liability for George.''
   On taxes, Simpson suggested he believes the next president may
be forced to ask for a tax increase to deal with the deficit.
   ``Good lord, somebody is going to have to do something in that
area or we'll be off the wall,'' he said.
   In separate talk show appearances, Quayle, Dole and Kemp
concentrated on criticizing Dukakis, an activity that would be at
the top of the agenda for whoever becomes the vice presidential
nominee.
   Interviewed from Evansville, Ind., on the ABC show, ``This Week
with David Brinkley,'' Quayle said Dukakis' Democratic Party
``stands for a party in retreat. It stands for a party of doom and
gloom. They don't have an agenda for the future.''
   As for his own prospects for being on the ticket, Quayle said,
``I would like to believe that I would be acceptable to the whole
party.''
   Dole said, ``I'm not running for vice president.'' In a joking
reference to his wife, the senator said, ``I'm not campaigning for
anyone, but she would be a great addition to the ticket.''
   Dole brushed off his attacks on Bush when they were competing
for the presidential nomination.
   ``Obviously in the primaries, I was not talking about his
strengths,'' said the Kansan.
   Thornburgh said it was ``very flattering'' to be mentioned but,
``I have a job to do for this president (Reagan) and until I've
heard anything from the vice president, I'm ready to go to work as
attorney general of the United States.'' Thornburgh was sworn in to
his new post on Friday.
   Craig Fuller, Bush's chief of staff, said, ``He will make a good
attorney general,'' when asked about Thornburgh. When asked if he
were saying Thornburgh, a former governor of Pennsylvania, was not
under consideration, Fuller said, ``I didn't say for how long.''

   Inmates angry over heat and crowded
conditions set fire to a county jail Sunday, destroying one wing of
the pre-Civil War building. At least eight people were injured.
   Prisoners at the Essex County Jail and House of Correction
pelted firefighters and police with cans and debris as flames
poured through the roof of the jail during the three-hour uprising.
   Two prisoners tried to escape but were caught before leaving the
grounds, authorities said.
   ``Cops got hit, firefighters got hit,'' Lawrence fire Lt. James
Campbell said. ``They threw pipes _ long pipes, I don't know where
they got them from _ bricks, bottles.''
   About 100 prisoners were moved from the destroyed east wing of
the 144-year-old jail to an outdoor recreation area, where some
tried to climb fences before they were contained by a phalanx of
riot police, authorities said. Tear gas was used to subdue the
inmates, authorities said.
   Essex County Special Sheriff Harry Coppola said 250 inmates were
being housed at the jail, about twice its official capacity. The
jail is not air-conditioned, and temperatures in the Boston area
Sunday climbed into the 90s.
   About noon, a group of inmates set a small fire in the gymnasium
that was quickly extinguished.
   But about 1 p.m., a second fire broke out that raged for 1{
hours, destroying a shingled roof over the east wing of the
cross-shaped, three-story granite building.
   At least eight people were injured, including five inmates and
one firefighter who were taken to Lawrence General Hospital and Bon
Secours Hospital in Methuen, authorities said. Hospital officials
said they were being treated for smoke inhalation and cuts.
   The jail predominantly houses prisoners convicted of
misdemeanors with maximum terms of up to 2{ years, officials said.
Among the inmates were 31 federal prisoners awaiting trial who are
kept in the facility under contract with the federal government,
Coppola said.
   Inside the jail yard, about 20 inmates, many clad only in
shorts, chanted ``food'' and ``unfair treatment'' to about 500
spectators who filled a park adjacent to the jail in this city of
60,000 located 30 miles north of Boston.
   State police Trooper Charles McPhail said inmate visitation
rights recently had been revoked because of unspecified problems,
which may also have been a cause for the uprising.
   About 300 police and firefighters from at least eight cities and
towns were called to the disturbance. The police entourage numbered
more than 200 state, county and local officers, including two
squads of helmeted riot police, authorities said.
   During the blaze in the gymnasium, which was set with paper and
other debris, inmates watching from their cells pelted firefighters
with cans and squirted them with shaving cream, Campbell said.
   About 100 firefighters were dispatched to the jail to fight the
second, larger fire. Riot police were called in after firefighting
efforts were hampered by the hail of debris, and the blaze was
under control about 2:30 p.m, officials said.
   About 35 of the jail's 127 cells were destroyed and virtually
all the others suffered smoke and water damage or other damage,
officials said.
   Michael Fair, head of the state's Department of Correction, said
his agency was looking for a place to house 110 to 140 inmates
displaced by the fire. The fire ``certainly puts a tremendous
strain on an already overcrowded system,'' Fair said.
   The state is planning a new facility in nearby Middleton to
replace the Lawrence jail, said state Human Services Secretary
Philip Johnston, the state's top prison official.
   The Lawrence prison, he added, ``is one of the oldest in the
country, and it's a very bad facility. That's the reason we should
get this going as quickly as possible.''
   Prison overcrowding has been a chronic problem in Massachusetts
at state and county facilities. Legislation giving the state
control of county facilities has been stalled in the state
Legislature for at least two years.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, shrugging
off speculation that his stock was rising as a potential
running-mate for George Bush, said Sunday that he is still a long
shot.
   ``I really am not out trying to get the job,'' said Domenici,
who arrived in the convention city Sunday night.
   But he made it clear that he would relish the opportunity to run
against Democrats Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen.
   ``I'm concerned about Michael Dukakis taking over a country
that's really on the way to a real recovery from a period of
enormous stagnation,'' he said.
   ``I know a lot about the American economy and the world economy.
I think I could dispel some of the very strange notions the
Democratic nominee is making about the new era of prosperity he
might bring.''
   Domenici was asked what his liabilities would be as a vice
presidential candidate.
   ``I'm from a very small state. We don't have very many electoral
votes. I'm not very well known. I've always thought Bob Dole was
the logical vice presidential nominee, and he's been through it
(before),'' he said.
   But he added, ``I speak a little Spanish. I'm ethnic. I'm
Italian. I'm an immigrant's son, both mother and father born in
Italy. I speak that language and I speak Spanish. ... Those are the
kinds of things that might give me a chance.''
   Asked if the Bush campaign has been in touch with him, Domenici
said, ``No, I haven't heard anything from them for maybe a week. I
heard some of my friends on TV this morning. I don't know what that
means. Most of them haven't heard anything, either. I think he's
told us he isn't going to tell anybody anything until Wednesday.''
   ``My guess is that I'm really a long shot still,'' Domenici said.

   Leaders of two major opposition groups held
protest rallies on Sunday, the day before the Electoral College
begins ratifying returns from the bitterly contested July 6
elections.
   Manuel J. Clouthier, presidential candidate of the conservative
National Action Party, claimed there was widespread vote fraud and
called on President Miguel de la Madrid to oversee the
nullification of the July balloting and set new elections for May
1990.
   He made the proposal in a letter to the president and released
the text at a midday rally at the Independence Monument. Clouthier
then led a march to Mexico City's main downtown plaza, where police
estimated the crowd at about 15,000.
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, presidential candidate of the leftist
National Democratic Front coalition, repeated his demand that the
Federal Election Commission release a breakdown of votes from
individual polling stations. He spoke at a rally in Juchitan in the
southern state of Oaxaca.
   Last week, Cardenas filed a criminal complaint against two
commission officials, saying the commission had violated the
electoral code by failing to release results from 24,642 voting
stations, nearly half the national total.
   ``Those who form the Electoral College must also know that there
is a people waiting for its resolutions _ who voted on July 6
against imposition, corruption and violence, who voted for
democracy and for a lawful regime and who will not permit abuses or
humiliations,'' he said Sunday.
   The Electoral College is to meet through Aug. 31, and the
opposition groups are expected to continue their almost daily
protest rallies.
   Clouthier, in the letter to de la Madrid, urged the president to
ask all political parties to participate in a what he called a
``Patriotic Conciliation and Electoral Legality Pact.''
   He said participants would instruct their delegates in the
Chamber of Deputies to vote to nullify the elections and appoint an
interim president to take office on Dec. 1, when de la Madrid steps
down at the end of his six-year term.
   New elections then would be held in May 1990, he said.
   ``It is possible that the presidential election ... could be
declared legal, but it won't be considered linked to justice by the
majority of the electorate,'' Clouthier said.
   Demonstrators shouted ``Maquio, Maquio,'' Clouthier's childhood
nickname, and waved the party's blue-and-white flags at the Mexico
City rally. Some carried papier-mache effigies of Carlos Salinas de
Gortari, the candidate of the governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party.
   Both the left and right accuse the government and the governing
party, which has held power since 1929, of widespread fraud during
the balloting and vote tabulations.
   Official results announced a week after the election gave
Salinas 50.36 percent of the vote, Cardenas 31.12 percent and
Clouthier 17.07 percent.
   The opposition plans demonstrations outside the Legislative
Palace when the Chamber of Deputies, serving as the Electoral
College, meets on Monday.
   Parties also have called on residents to protest with 15-minute
blackouts at 8 p.m. every evening while the sessions last. The
college meets through the end of the month to review the results
and formally declare the winner.
   Reeling from its smallest margin of victory ever in a
presidential race, along with congressional losses and the
opposition's refusal to concede, the 59-year-old governing party
has pledged reforms and defended the election process.
   ``In these days, the confrontations could grow,'' Manuel Camacho
Solis, secretary-general of the Institutional Revolutionary Party,
said Friday.
   In an apparent warning to the opposition, he said basic
agreements among the parties were possible, but respect for
decisions of the Federal Elections Commission and the Electoral
College ``should be part of any widely accepted agreement.''
   Representatives of the governing party and the two main
opposition parties have signed a joint declaration saying that
orderly demonstrations would be allowed and no special security
would be needed.
   The left-leaning newspaper La Jornada praised the agreement as
``contributing substantially to resolving what was beginning to
become a conflict.''
   The Chamber of Deputies has 300 seats filled by direct election
and 200 assigned according to the proportion of the vote received.
   On Saturday, the Federal Electoral Commission assigned the
proportional seats, giving the governing party a total of 247 and
opposition parties 227. Certificates on 13 seats for the
Institutional Revolutionary Party were withheld pending resolution
of challenges.

   A group of Pakistanis crossed the border and
opened fire on Indian guards who challenged them, an Indian
official said. He reported 11 Pakistanis killed in the three-hour
battle that followed.
   The official said it was not immediately clear why the
Pakistanis had entered India and how many were in their group. He
gave no explanation of why they were armed.
   The Pakistanis crossed the border in the Samba area near the
city of Jammu at the northern tip of India, according to the
official, M. Dogra, inspector general of the Border Security Force.
   He told reporters that some of the Pakistanis managed to flee
back into Pakistan after the battle.
   ``We cannot say for what purpose they wanted to cross the
frontier illegally,'' Dogra said. ``They certainly had a purpose,
they could not have just strayed.''
   Pakistani diplomats in New Delhi were not immediately available
for comment.
   India and Pakistan have fought three wars since Britain withdrew
and allowed independence for both countries in 1947.

   Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, on George Bush's
list of potential vice presidential candidates, said Sunday that he
would ``do anything'' to help him capture the White House.
   Quayle said he has provided the Bush campaign with the
background information it requested in connection with its search
for a running mate. Members of the Indiana delegation on Sunday
sported red and blue Bush-Quayle buttons.
   ``It's important for George Bush to have the right person,''
Quayle said. But he added that ``there's not a dime's worth of
difference'' philosophically among the contenders for the vice
presidential nomination.
   ``I think George Bush is going to keep this one very, very close
to the chest,'' said Quayle. ``George Bush understands what we need
(in a vice presidential nominee), and I'll do anything I can to
help him.''
   Quayle, 41, known for his conservative voting record during
eight years in the Senate, said he considers himself ``appealing to
conservatives and to moderates.''
   Accompanied by his wife, Marilyn, Quayle was greeted by a brass
band and a crush of camera crews as he arrived at the New Orleans
airport for the Republican National Convention. He later attended a
private reception for the Indiana delegation at the home of
Louisiana state Sen. Ken Hollis.
   ``I think we'll just enjoy ourselves and wait for the big
announcement,'' Quayle said. ``It's sort of like anticipating Keith
Smart's shot at the Superdome.''
   The reference was to the last-second basket that gave Indiana
University a victory over Syracuse in the NCAA basketball
championship last year. The game was played in the Louisiana
Superdome, site of the convention.

   A cabin cruiser exploded about 30 feet
from a lake shore, killing a 5-year-old boy and burning five other
people, three critically, authorities said.
   The 26-foot boat's motor stalled shortly after it was launched
into Lake Murray Saturday afternoon. As the boaters tried to
restart the motor, gas fumes ignited a fireball that quickly
engulfed the boat.
   ``It was completely ablaze from bow to stern. Smoke was visible
from quite a ways back,'' lake patrolman Michael Key said Sunday.
``From what we can tell, two people were blown overboard.''
   Lifeguard Monte Holland, 19, dragged two women ashore.
   ``I rushed down there and saw one little girl burned, sitting on
the dock. I looked out and saw a guy who was trying to stay up and
keep another lady afloat. She wouldn't have stayed afloat if
somebody hadn't helped her,'' Holland said. ``I went out and got
her and then went back in and helped another lady. I did what I had
to do.''
   Bryan Jordon, 5, died of burns at the scene, according to the
Oklahoma Lake Patrol.
   Passengers Cheryle Jordan, 29 and Sarah Weatherford, 26, were in
critical condition Sunday with burns, authorities said. A
Children's Hospital of Oklahoma spokeswoman said Rachael
Weatherford, 5, improved to serious condition late Sunday after
being admitted in critical condition with second- and third-degree
burns over 70 percent of her body.
   Blane L. Fore, 30, the driver of the boat, was in fair condition
Sunday with burns on his leg, and Kenneth Scott Jordan, 29, was in
serious condition.
   Lake Murray is about 30 miles north of the Texas-Oklahoma border
and 140 miles south of Oklahoma City.

   In broad daylight and in mid-Manhattan, the
busiest part of the nation's busiest city, police say they have
seen a marked upswing in especially brazen robberies on the crowded
streets.
   ``We have gangs of people and they swarm like locusts,'' said
police Sgt. Richard A. Scantlebury, a 23-year veteran. ``They will
come up to a field of wheat _ which is three tourists _ and pick
them dry. Then the swarm will move along.''
   One such crime on July 27 made headlines. The Ashcroft family of
Muncie, Ind., was standing outside St. Patrick's Cathedral at 5
p.m. when a 22-year-old man with a pistol jumped out of a car and
demanded their video camera. The bandit was shot to death when, in
trying to flee, he tried to commandeer a car driven by an off-duty
correction officer.
   ``As soon as I heard about that one, I thought, `He must be
crazy on crack,''' said Lt. George Hall, head of the Manhattan
Robbery Squad. The highly addictive form of cocaine is blamed for
many of the thefts.
   The proximity of the Martinique Hotel, one of the city's
homeless hotels, also is a contributing factor. Within blocks of
the Martinique, affluent shoppers browse in Macy's, Lord & Taylor
and other stores.
   ``You have a lot of teen-agers with nothing to do with their
time. They've been plopped into the middle of midtown, wealth,
money and they have nothing,'' the sergeant said.
   ``We have more people coming of age; robbery is a young crime,''
Scantlebury said. ``You rarely find a 43-year-old doing street
robberies. They're not as fleet of foot.''
   Each day, Manhattan offers thieves a potpourri of prey.
Thousands of commuters engulf the island to work and shop, and
tourists keep on coming; last year, 17.8 million tourists came to
New York City, and the numbers are running about the same for 1988,
according to the Convention and Visitors Bureau.
   ``It's like fishing in a stocked lake,'' Scantlebury said.
``There are more people. As a result there are going to be more
victims and a greater chance of a guy getting away.''
   Robberies in the first three months of 1988 were up more than 13
percent, from 835 in the first quarter of 1987 to 950, in Midtown
South Precinct, bordered by 29th and 45th Streets, after a 9
percent increase in 1987, according to police figures. Robberies in
Midtown North Precinct, bordered by 45th and 59th streets, are up
10 percent, from 397 in 1987's first quarter to 437 this year,
after a 2 percent decrease last year.
   To combat the problem, more uniformed police are being deployed
on foot patrol. And when members of the robbery squad are not
investigating cases, they are assigned to keep an eye on the
streets.
   But despite a heavy police presence in the area, ``Times Square
is going nuts,'' Hall said. ``We go by there late at night; we
shudder when we see these unsuspecting tourists coming out of the
theatre at 11, 12 o'clock at night. They're just walking
statistics.''
   Street thieves sometimes use wheels. Bicycles are favored
because they allow a quick getaway even in congested traffic, and a
thief can blend in with the city's ubiquitous bicycle messengers.
   ``They've become so sophisticated they transport their bikes
into Manhattan in the body of a truck,'' Scantlebury said. When
they reach their base, usually in Lower Manhattan, ``they put the
bikes in the truck and drive away,'' escaping police who are
looking for suspects on bikes.
   Then there are thieves who follow victims out of banks and onto
the crowded streets, striking suddenly, without a word, punching
them in the face and grabbing their money.
   Only two of them have been arrested since the ring began its
operations more than a year ago, and prosecution is difficult
because most victims can't identify their attacker.
   For many crimes against tourists, punishment is uncertain. ``The
bad guys know that if you rob a tourist, he's not going to be
around to be a witness,'' Scantlebury said.

<TEXT>
   A West German businessman held
hostage in Lebanon has asked his country to free TWA hijacker
Mohammed Hamadi in exchange for his own release, a magazine said
Sunday.
   The magazine Quick released what it said was a letter Rudolf
Cordes wrote to the West German government. The letter is to be
published in its Wednesday edition.
   Quick said Cordes' wrote in his undated letter:
   ``More than a year and a half has already passed. My health
worsens steadily. A doctor has been here to see me many times.
People are very nice to me here. So why can't Mohammed be set free?
What has he done against West Germany?''
   The letter, according to Quick, was written in German and signed
``A desperate West German.''
   Cordes, 53, was kidnapped Jan. 17, 1987, after arriving in
Beirut as manager of the West German chemical concern Hoechst AG.
West German security sources said he was being held by Hezbollah,
an umbrella organization for Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem factions
in Lebanon.
   Quick also quoted Abdel-Kadar Sahraoui, an Algerian middleman it
says delivered the letter, as saying the kidnappers are no longer
demanding that Hamadi be traded for Cordes.
   Sahraoui was reported as saying that Cordes' captors are now
demanding that West Germany blame Iraq instead of Iran for the
8-year-old Persian Gulf war.
   The magazine said it did not know why Sahraoui's statements
contradicted Cordes' letter. It speculated that Cordes' captors had
not yet told him they were no longer demanding an exchange with
Hamadi.
   Quick did not say how it learned the contents of Cortes' letter.
   The West German government confirmed on Aug. 4 that it received
a letter from Cordes, but has refused to disclose what he wrote.
   Ulrich Strempel, a government spokesman, said he could not
comment on the magazine report, saying that has been the standard
government procedure as long as Cordes was held hostage.
   Mohammed Hamadi is on trial in Frankfurt on charges of air
piracy and murder in the 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner to
Beirut, in which a U.S. Navy diver was killed and 39 Americans were
held hostage for 17 days.
   Hamadi has admitted in court that he was one of the hijackers,
but denied killing the diver.
   A West German court in April convicted Hamadi's older brother,
Abbas, of masterminding the kidnapping of Cordes and another West
German, Alfred Schmidt, in an effort to force authorities to
release Mohammed. Abbas was sentenced to 13 years in prison.
Schmidt was released in September 1987.
   Eighteen foreign hostages, including nine Americans, have been
kidnapped in Lebanon.
   The longest held is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

   Residents of this small farming town and
beyond crowded Sunday into the new Our Lady of Guadalupe Church,
built to replace the one destroyed in last year's tornado that
killed 30 people.
   Bishop Raymundo Peno dedicated the church as a shrine to the
Virgin of Guadalupe, the first such shrine in the El Paso Roman
Catholic Diocese.
   ``In the future, we hope this will become the center for
spiritual growth in West Texas,'' Pena said of the only church in
the predominantly Hispanic town of about 350 people. ``They can
come for spiritual retreats and for pilgrimages.''
   The brown-and-gray brick structure was built on the site of the
old cinder block church, which was leveled during the May 22, 1987,
tornado. The new building, completed in late June, boasts
classrooms, a dormitory and kitchen.
   The church's sanctuary is dominated by a blue-and-orange stained
glass archway with a statuette of the Virgin of Guadalupe in the
center.
   The church held a much larger crowd Sunday than the sanctuary's
official capacity of 276, as lay representatives from every parish
in the vast El Paso Diocese attended. The crowd of about 600
spilled into the halls and outside as worshipers strained to hear.
   ``It's great to have the church back,'' said Tomas Martinez, who
lives a block west of the building. ``If we had a crowd like this
every time, we'd have a pretty good town here.''
   Last year's tornado destroyed about 40 houses. Many of the 30
people who were killed were attending a preschool graduation
ceremony at a community center when the twister hit the structure
with little warning.
   Gabriel Candelas, who grew up across the street from the church,
said he rushed to Saragosa from his home in El Paso when he heard
about the twister. He arrived about 3 a.m., eight hours after the
tornado, he said.
   ``It was unrecognizable _ completely different,'' he said. ``I
couldn't find my parents' house.''
   A little over a year later, the Red Cross, Texas Department of
Community Affairs, and the Catholic Church have rebuilt every
house. A new community center with a 300-person capacity tornado
shelter is a block from the church.
   ``It's definitely had an impact on the people _ tension,
stress,'' Candelas said. ``Some people are very moody because they
lost all they had and their loved ones. But it's getting better.''

<HEAD>Activists Cheer Reagan Minority Record Despite Tiny Convention
Numbers</HEAD>

   More than 1,000 activists insisted Sunday
that ``blacks will not be slaves to a political party'' and cheered
the Reagan record on minority appointments. But they conceded
concern about holding a Republican National Convention with 92
percent white participants.
   ``We want to be critical without being antagonistic,'' said
Clarence Smith, chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission. ``The party has to do more than just sit back
passively.''
   ``That's what the Republican Party has to do, open up its
doors,'' echoed George Smith, a delegate from San Diego. ``The
party has to have more blacks at all levels, at all echelons.''
   A group called the Council of Minority Americans held the
dinner-reception to focus on the blacks, Hispanics and other
minorities named to positions in the federal government. Organizers
insisted that Republicans have a strong record to sell to minority
voters and said Democrats are taking their votes for granted.
   ``You saw the Democratic Party make a statement that the black
vote is simply there,'' said Bill Wilson, a spokesman for the group.
   ``This is not just a one-night arrangement, this is designed to
be the kickoff of an ongoing effort,'' Wilson said. ``You can't get
any economic clout if you can't get a job.''
   The event came on the eve of a GOP convention overwhelmingly
dominated by whites, with fewer than 8 percent of the delegates
coming from minorities, according to an Associated Press survey.
   That rankled many attending, but they insisted the best way to
resolve the disparity was to work within the party.
   ``This is designed to let the convention know there are
minorities who do support the ticket,'' said Lawrence King, an
Omaha, Neb., businessman who organized the council.
   Questioned about the tiny number of blacks and other minorities
represented on the convention floor, King said: ``I think that's
basically the way things are. There are not a lot of black
Republicans.''
   Others argued that George Bush, the certain nominee, has a
strong record on civil rights issues and will lure black voters.
   ``We have perhaps a Republican presidential nominee with the
greatest commitment to civil rights since Richard Nixon,'' said Dan
Smith, an alternate from Los Angeles. ``That's not to say there has
been enough progress. By my reckoning, it ought to be 10 percent or
12 percent.''

   A carriage horse was temporarily overcome by
heat Sunday and a running club changed its plans for a race for the
first time in its history as the worst heat wave in decades
continued to wrack the city.
   It hit 96 degrees at 4 p.m. _ the 31st day this summer that the
temperature exceeded 90 degrees. The record of 37 days was set in
1944.
   Consolidated Edison also reported a record for Sunday
electricity demand: 7,645 megawatts between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m.,
breaking the record of 6,770 megawatts, set last Sunday. Spokesman
Marty Gitten said peak demand often occurs at that hour as people
return home from weekend activities and turn on air conditioners
and lights.
   A horse put to work pulling a carriage across the sizzling
streets collapsed of apparent heat prostration but apparently
suffered no lasting effects, the authorities said.
   The horse collapsed on a street on Manhattan's East Side shortly
after noon. It lay for about 90 minutes before regaining enough
strength to get into a trailer to be taken to its stable nearby,
said William Kapps, chief law-enforcement officer of the American
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
   Horse-drawn sightseeing carriages are banned from city streets
when the temperature tops 90 degrees. The temperature in Central
Park hit 90 at noon, the weather service said. It had not been
determined if the carriage driver would be ticketed, Kapps said.
   For the first time in its 30-year history, the New York Road
Runners Club changed a road race through Central Park to a
non-competitive ``fun run'' because of the oppressive temperatures,
said Fred Lebow, president of the club.
   ``When we announced the decision to run it as a `fun run,' it
was soundly booed,'' he said. However, by the finish of the
3.1-mile run, many of the more than 1,000 participants applauded
his judgment, he said.
   The decision was prompted in part by the deaths of two young men
who collapsed and died after running separate 3{-mile races in
sweltering heat earlier in the summer, Lebow said. Officials said
the two men, who were participating in corporate team competitions,
were not in proper shape to be running.
   None of the runners in Sunday's event suffered any ill effects
from the heat and humidity, Lebow and the city's Emergency Medical
Service said.
   New York City has been roasting for six weeks, enduring what
Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University,
called the worst heat wave since the mid-1950s.

   Five gay activists were arrested Sunday after
a shoving incident during President Reagan's welcoming speech on
the eve of the Republican National Convention, police said.
   The five were carrying signs criticizing the Reagan
administration's AIDs policy, and their supporters said they were
attacked by people in the crowd.
   The demonstrators were booked for disturbing the peace.
   The same charge was lodged against three members of an
organization called Anarchist Relief Front in a separate incident
at 2 a.m. Saturday. The group asserted police roughed up the men as
they were distributing leaflets against racism and white supremacy.
   Police Capt. John Hughes said the three were fighting among
themselves and were arrested after they refused to stop and one
kicked an officer.
   Other demonstrations went off peacefully, including a parade of
feminists and a ``kiss-in'' at which protesters surrounded Roman
Catholic Archbishop Philip N. Hannan and shouted complaints about
church policy on homosexuality.
   
   Police spokesman John Bryson said the incident during Reagan's
appearance occurred when about 10 demonstrators with the gay rights
group Act Up began shoving people and punches were thrown.
   He identified them as Brian K. Jackson of Monroe, La.; Mark
Rexroad of Los Angeles; Joseph M. Benlevi of Princeton, N.J., and
Rand M. Snyder and Herbert S. Quefter, both of New York City.
   Morris Kight, who identified himself as a gay activist from Los
Angeles, denied the demonstrators shoved anyone.
   ``A group of young men physically attacked them,'' he said.
``The Secret Service tried to intervene to protect them, but the
police arrested them.''
   In the incident at Jackson Square involving the archbishop, the
demonstrators staged a homosexual kiss-in at which men and women
walked around in a long oval, kissing as they passed.
   ``We kiss in an aggressive demonstration of affection,'' said a
statement read through a bullhorn. ``We kiss to protest the cruel
and painful bigotry that affects the lives of lesbians and gay men.
We kiss so that all who see us will be forced to confront their
homophobia.''
   At the Democratic Convention in Atlanta, a similar ``kiss-in''
started a shoving match between gay demonstrators and police. But
the Big Easy's officers just stood back and watched.
   ``That's what we are here _ easy going,'' said Officer J. Parker.
   Some of the 40 to 50 demonstrators surged around Hannan after he
came out of St. Louis Cathedral to shake hands with parishioners
between the 10 and 11 o'clock masses.
   ``We're used to demonstrations. Jackson Square is where
everything happens,'' Hannan, resplendant in green and gold
vestments, told a man in a Sunday suit.
   Just behind Hannan, two men in an extended clinch held a
sexually explicit sign above his head.
   ``All I can say is God bless you,'' Hannan said when asked for
comment. He said the Archdiocese of New Orleans was the first group
in the state to open a hospice for patients of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, with another to open soon.
   While this was happening, about 150 women representing 20
feminist groups gathered at Armstrong Park at the other end of the
French Quarter. Many climbed into 13 mule-drawn carriages and
paraded with a Dixieland band.
   Like people in any other New Orleans parade, the group threw
beads to the crowd. They also threw small cups bearing the single
sentence of the Equal Rights Amendment and plastic ``doubloons''
with the legend ``ERA YES'' in white on green. A children's
advocacy group tossed fortune cookies; the slips inside read, ``The
children of today are the leaders of tomorrow.''
   Speakers exhorted the crowd to political action.
   ``We are here to tell the world that the Republican Party has
turned its back on women's rights,'' said Molly Yard, president of
the National Organization for Women. ``But this does not let the
Democrats off the hook. ... They will at their peril ignore women's
issues.''
   She told the group to keep an eye on what the Republicans and
Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis and others in his
party do on women's issues.

<HEAD>Border Patrol Reports 35 Salvadorans Locked inside Sweltering
Boxcar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KINGSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty-five dehydrated Salvadorans were
found locked inside a sweltering boxcar Sunday during temperatures
well over 100 degrees, authorities said.
   U.S. Border Patrol officials found 20 more illegal aliens
outside the locked boxcar but aboard the same freight train bound
for Houston about 10:30 a.m., said Border Patrol agent Cruz McGuire.
   ``It was well over 100 degrees when we found them,'' Border
Patrol agent Ramiro Gonzalez told the Corpus Christi Caller-Times.
``It was probably another 20 to 30 degrees hotter inside the car.''
   The Salvadorans, including three women and two 14-year-old boys,
had been locked inside the car since they boarded the train five
hours earlier in Brownsville, Gonzalez said. Some were trying to
get air through holes in the boxcar, he said.
   ``When we opened the car up, the people were pale and real
sweaty, and then we transported them to the Border Patrol station
in Kingsville and gave them water and we fed them,'' Gonzalez said.
   If the Border Patrol had not intervened, the Salvadorans could
have suffered the same fate as 18 aliens found dead last summer
locked inside a boxcar near the West Texas town of Sierra Blanca.
   The train had traveled about 25 miles north from Brownsville,
which is the southernmost city in Texas and borders Matamoros,
Mexico, when Harlingen Border Patrol agents noticed aliens aboard,
some riding on grain hoppers. The agents then followed the train
through isolated ranch land to Kingsville, about 100 miles north of
Brownsville.
   Officials checked the train car by car at the Kingsville freight
yard until an agent heard voices inside an insulated boxcar,
Gonzalez said. The aliens inside told agents that the door was to
have been kept open to allow ventilation, but either the smuggler
or a train station employee in Brownsville closed and locked the
door, Gonzalez said.
   Authorities did not know the identity of the smuggler whom the
aliens said they paid $300 to $600, Gonzalez said.
   The 35 Salvadorans were detained on immigration charges and
faced deportation, along with a Honduran man and 19 Mexican
nationals, authorities said.

   George Bush is playing the vice president
gambit for everything it's worth, which isn't very much. But then,
it's the only bit of show business available this week at the
Republican National Convention.
   His orchestrated surprise will be good theater for a few hours
in New Orleans. And, obviously, the Republican presidential
nominee's choice of a running mate is a crucial decision in the GOP
bid to keep the White House.
   But nobody is going to remember the theatrics once they are done.
   The Bush plan is to announce the selection on Thursday morning,
with tight secrecy until then. Campaign manager Lee Atwater said
there'll be ``as much drama as we can have,'' the better to boost
interest and television ratings.

   George Bush guarded his vice presidential
deliberations Sunday, while one of his prospective running mates
said he didn't want the job and others acted like they were
auditioning for it.
   Bashing Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis was the
order of the day for Sens. Dan Quayle of Indiana and Bob Dole of
Kansas, and Rep. Jack Kemp of New York _ all on Bush's list of
potential vice presidents.
   Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, a close Bush friend who also was
on the list, said ``I would be a liability,'' and disclosed he had
asked the GOP nominee-to-be to drop him from consideration.
   Bush was at the vice presidential residence in Washington and
keeping his own counsel on his deliberations on a running mate. He
had lunch with Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, who is slated
to take command of his presidential campaign, and worked on his
acceptance speech.
   Even top aides, who have conferred regularly with Bush,
disclaimed any knowledge of whether he was leaning toward one
prospect or another.

   As George Bush approaches the high noon of his
quest for the Republican presidential nomination, he is striving to
move out of the shadow cast by President Reagan while seeking to
capitalize on Reagan's enormous popularity.
   Reagan's shadow has already shortened for Bush. These days he is
seldom dogged with questions about distancing himself from the
president. Instead, the questions now center on whether his
candidacy is exerting too much influence over the Reagan White
House.
   Both Bush and Reagan in recent days have fended off suggestions
that some presidential decisions have been motivated by an effort
to help the Bush campaign.

   ``What you see with me is what you get. I'm not running for
president _ George Bush is,'' says the snowy-haired wife of the

   Mrs. Bush says she is eager to get out on the campaign trail for
the man she ``absolutely adores'' and that she intends to tell
voters about his strength, courage and ability to get things done.
   But her loyalty to her husband of 43 years has its price.
   Calling herself the ``world's worst secret keeper,'' Mrs. Bush
said she has asked her husband not tell her about his choice for a
running mate. ``I've kept secrets, but it's agony,'' she said.
``This time, I want to be surprised.''

   Asking about a sexual partner's health or sexual
history is not a reliable means of avoiding AIDS because many
people lie to have sex, a researcher says.
   One-third of sexually experienced male college students and 10
percent of women admitted in a study that they have told a lie of
some sort to get someone to sleep with them, the researcher said.
   ``Asking partners about risk factors is probably not a very good
strategy for reducing the risk of AIDS,'' said Susan Cochran,
associate professor in the psychology department of California
State University at Northridge.
   She described results of her survey Saturday at the annual
meeting of the American Psychological Association.

   U.S. officials are frustrated by persistent
reports _ some blamed on Soviet disinformation _ that Latin
American children are being butchered for organ transplants in the
United States.
   The reports have been crisscrossing the globe for the past 20
months, confounding U.S. officials who have been trying to locate
their genesis, track their progress and provide credible denials.
   The latest report surfaced last week in Paraguay, after police
raided a house and found seven infants and several pregnant women
who apparently planned to give their babies up for adoption.
   A juvenile judge, Angel Campos, said that while he had no proof,
he believed some of the babies might be dismembered in the United
States for their organs, which could then be sold for hundreds of
dollars.
   The story, circulated by a respected news agency, has been
making the rounds of the world press this week despite adamant
denials from the U.S. Embassy in Asuncion.

   After years of being scorned as
ineffective and anti-American, the United Nations is making a
comeback as a potent instrument of international peacemaking, an
old idea whose time has come again.
   Blue-helmeted U.N. peacekeeping troops are peering through
binoculars from the beaches of Cyprus to the mountains of
Afghanistan. About 350 soon will monitor a cease-fire in the
Iran-Iraq war, and they are likely to be deployed in southern
Africa and Cambodia under emerging peace pacts.
   The United Nations owes its revitalized role to the superpowers'
improved relations and their interest in redirecting resources from
regional conflict to economic development. If the organization is
on a roll, it is because the superpowers have decided the time has
come to exploit it.

   Anti-government groups in Burma called

   In his northern Philippine stronghold,
Ferdinand Marcos remains a pervasive, respected figure more than
two years after a Manila-based uprising toppled his 20-year
authoritarian regime.
   ``I tell you that if he ran again, he would win hands down
here,'' said Rafael Benemerito, mayor of the town of Pagudpud in
the province of Ilocos Norte, where Marcos was born in 1919. ``You
know, we Ilocanos are very clannish.''
   In most of the Philippines, the Marcos years are associated with
massive corruption, economic mismanagement and oppression.
President Corazon Aquino has refused to allow Marcos to return from
Hawaii, where he fled after the February 1986 uprising that
propelled her to power.

   Israeli officials have stirred Arab protests
with plans to dig an opening that will allow tourists to walk along
the entire western wall of the ancient Jewish Temple, which was
destroyed by the Romans in A.D. 70.
   Caretakers of the Al Aqsa mosque complex, built on the 36-acre
plateau that once held the temple, fear any digging will serve as a
pretext to start excavations under the Islamic holy site.
   Palestinians in Jerusalem's Old City rioted in July, forcing
Israeli workers to halt digging an entrance in a narrow side street
off the Via Dolorosa, where tradition says Jesus carried the cross
to his crucifixion.

   Leaked campaign strategy memos laced with
coarse remarks threaten to ignite racial tensions in the early
stages of a mayoral campaign that pits a Jewish city councilman
against black incumbent Tom Bradley.
   The memos were prepared by a consulting firm associated with
39-year-old City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who is seeking to
become the city's first Jewish mayor and poses by many accounts the
first real challenge to Bradley in a decade. Both are Democrats;
the race is nonpartisan.
   The documents by veteran strategists Michael Berman and Carl
D'Agostino, whose firm is known as BAD Campaigns, berate
Yaroslavsky about his grim demeanor, mock Bradley's intelligence,
refer to environmentalists as ``tree huggers'' and slow-growth
advocates as ``crazed homeowners.''

<TEXT>
   Florida citrus merchandisers, always
protective of their high-quality product, are taking action to warn
confused consumers they may be spending too much for diluted-juice
beverages.
   ``Deceptive labeling can cost consumers millions of dollars each
year,'' says Robert Behr, economic research director for the
Florida Department of Citrus.
   Industry leaders are also asking the federal Food and Drug
Administration to implement _ rather than revoke _ a regulation
requiring fruit and vegetable juice products to be clearly labeled
to show the percentage of juice.
   Besides concern that consumers are confusing diluted products
for ``real'' orange and grapefruit juice, industry officials are
reacting to growing competition from other juices and juice-based
drinks.
   For instance, high prices and a poor consumer image have caused
a precipitous decline in sales of 100-percent grapefruit juice over
the past decade. Orange juice, too, has lost some of its market
share to apple juice and others, plus the soft drinks that contain
small amounts of fruit juices.
   Along with its modest consumer-awareness campaign, the Citrus
Department is distributing new grapefruit juice television
commercials, a departure from recent years when such advertising
was limited to newspapers and magazines.
   In the past, 100 percent-pure grapefruit juice has been
primarily advertised as a healthy, wholesome product, says
department publicist Cathy Clay.
   ``In addition to that, we are now showing (in the TV
commercials) that it is more refreshing, invigorating, uplifting,''
she said.
   The department's citrus marketing director, William P. Gordon,
calls the $4.3 million, 23-week run of TV commercials beginning in
mid-September ``a new approach to grapefruit juice advertising ...
to increase top-of-mind awareness and meet the growing competition
from other juices or juice-based beverages.''
   A recent study done for the Citrus Department showed that 40
percent of the consumers questioned believed that a diluted
grapefruit beverage was 100 percent pure juice.
   The product, advertised as a grapefruit cocktail, contained less
than 50 percent grapefruit juice and its label did not show that.
   If only one person out of 10 mistakenly believes a certain
product contains pure juice, consumers could be overspending from
$50 million to $90 million a year, depending on the amount of juice
in that beverage, Behr said.
   ``In some cases, the consumers are actually paying more for a
product that is not 100 percent juice, even though that is what
they believe they are getting,'' he said.
   Few of the diluted-juice beverages on grocery shelves have the
juice content on their labels, department officials say, despite an
FDA regulation requiring such information.
   ``The fruit and vegetable juice labeling rule has been on the
FDA's books for several years, but it has never been implemented,''
said the department's general counsel, Kristen Chadwell.
   And because of pressure from some industry groups, the FDA has
declared its intent to revoke the rule, Ms. Chadwell said.
   ``We, of course, have since sent them our objections to the
revocation and provided them with our research results,'' she said.
   The FDA is expected to decide which way to go by the end of the
year.
   The proliferation of juice-based drinks, blends, cocktails,
beverages and other variations _ with or without proper labeling
information _ has stirred some consumer groups into action.
   The Ralph Nader Center for Science in the Public Interest has
called on the FDA to crack down on manufacturers who do not list
the percentage of juice contained in the products. And the FDA has
been looking into false or misleading labels on some of the diluted
beverages.
   The FDA does require that products sold as orange juice carry
labels declaring the exact percentage of juice they contain.
Florida industry people would like the same rule to apply to
grapefruit juice, eliminating at least that problem for the
confused consumer.

   The United States should abandon farm price
supports and production controls to capitalize on a growing demand
by poorer nations for food, an economics professor says.
   ``U.S. policy not only distorts U.S. production away from its
comparative advantage but contributes to the distortion of
production decisions around the world,'' said John M. Antle, an
associate professor of farm economics at the University of Montana.
   ``Consequently, the U.S. share in commodity trade declines, and
the United States fails to exploit its comparative advantage,'' he
said.
   Antle released a study that predicts developed countries,
including some in East Asia and Latin America, will be shipping
more food to poor ones in coming years.
   The four-year study, ``World Agricultural Development and the
Future of U.S. Agriculture,'' was sponsored by the conservative
American Enterprise Institute.
   The report does not take into account the current drought in
this country and others and its effect on reducing world food
reserves.
   ``Eastern Asia and Latin America are likely to continue to
experience high rates of growth in... food production, and
sub-Saharan Africa can be expected to continue to face stagnation
and even reductions in... food production and real income,'' Antle
said.
   ``The effect of these trends will be to increase further the...
trade in agricultural commodities, especially cereals, between
developed and developing countries,'' his report said.
   The study predicted increased grain production in the United
States and Canada until at least the year 2000. The increase is
greater than projected for 12 European nations that compete with
the U.S. but less than the projected increase for the Soviet Union
and other communist-ruled countries in Asia and Latin America.
   Antle also predicted surpluses of millions of tons of major food
crops in China, East Asia and Southeast Asia in the year 2000,
compared with deficits in 1980. But he forecasts continued or
larger shortfalls for other parts of the Third World.
   Antle also said some countries will remain poor even if they use
their meager resources efficiently, especially semi-arid tropical
regions in south central India, northern and sub-Sahara Africa and
parts of Latin America.
   Most poorer countries will find it hard to increase their
imports as Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea have done, he said.
Those three are small, homogeneous and densely populated with low
transport costs, access to shipping lanes, and have been able to
make investments in human capital and institutions, he said.
   The future of China's potential for increased supply and demand
depends on its government's decisions, Antle added.
   ``What does seem fairly certain is that East Asia and the
middle-income countries of Latin America are particularly well
positioned to take advantage of new technologies and new market
opportunities,'' he said.

   Broadcasters are being urged to restrict the
airing of sexually explicit material while the Federal
Communications Commission studies new guidelines to shield children
from ``indecent'' programs.
   ``I would tell broadcasters they need to be cautious,'' said
Jeff Baumann, general counsel for the National Association of
Broadcasters.
   The FCC is under orders from a federal appeals court to review
the agency's rules governing sexually explicit material on
nighttime television and radio. The inquiry is due to begin shortly
and take several months before new rules are adopted, said Diane
Killory, FCC general counsel.
   In the meantime, it is unclear at what times in the evening
``indecent'' programs can be aired without fear that unsupervised
children will be listening or watching.
   The appeals court ruling suspended a $2,000 fine the FCC levied
early this year against KZKC-TV, Kansas City, for airing the movie
``Private Lessons'' during prime time in May 1987. The action had
been the first against a broadcaster since the FCC toughened its
decency standards in April 1987.
   The July 29 court decision could affect discussions by House and
Senate conferees who will consider an amendment to a budget bill
sponsored by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., to prohibit stations from
airing indecent material at any time.
   Congressional sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said
despite indications the measure would be struck down in court,
chances were good that an election-year Congress would pass a ban
on broadcast indecency.
   Courts have ruled that indecent but not obscene material is
protected by the First Amendment, though children's access to it
may be regulated.
   The July 29 ruling affirmed the FCC's definition of indecency,
adopted from a Supreme Court ruling: ``Language ... that depicts or
describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary
community standards for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory
activities or organs.''
   Obscenity is defined similarly except that it also appeals to
the prurient interest and lacks serious scientific, literary,
artistic or political value.
   The three-judge panel had trouble with the FCC's policy of
restricting indecent programming to between midnight and 6 a.m.,
the time the agency determined that children were not likely to be
in the audience.
   The court said the FCC had ``not adequately thought through''
the time restrictions and must try to devise a rule that will
``promote parental _ as distinguished from government _ control.''
   The court upheld an FCC warning issued against disc jockey
Howard Stern for portions of his show that aired between 6 a.m. and
10 a.m. The FCC reads that part of the decision to permit continued
enforcement of its decency rules during the daytime, Killory said.
   ``But after that it seems questionable whether the court would
let us enforce the indecency rule during an evening broadcast until
we have concluded our inquiry and set a specific time in the
evening,'' Killory said.
   ``The court didn't say when daytime ends or evening begins,''
she said.
   It is possible the FCC won't conclude the inquiry and approve
new rules before the end of the year, she said. In that case, the
matter might be handled by a commission shaped by a new
administration.

   In beds of damp compost, a web resembling
angel hair forms. Tiny stems push out of the mulch, and almost
overnight swell into firm, white mushrooms at one of the nation's
largest mushroom farms.
   There are no caves or fields, just 8.5 acres of sophisticated
mushroom production under the roof at Princeton Farms, in a rural
section of Bureau County.
   This farm and a sister facility in Zellwood, Fla., both owned by
Lyon Foods, market about 32 million pounds of fresh mushrooms a
year, said Princeton manager Ralph Scott.
   ``It's a blending of science and art,'' Scott said. ``Mushrooms
are growing organisms, and you have to handle them very carefully.''
   One popular mushroom misconception is that the sublime fungus
grows only in the dark and with little attention, he said.
Production rooms at Princeton are brightly lit, and the annual
payroll for the labor-intensive business is $6 million.
   The key to mushroom production is rich, black soil blended from
decomposed straw, manure, protein and peat moss.
   Each week 35 tractor-trailer trucks arrive at the farm with
straw shoveled out of horse stalls at Chicago's racetracks. Steam
rises from the long, narrow piles as the pungent material
decomposes, producing temperatures of 160 degrees within the
compost.
   ``Our success is here _ good compost makes good mushrooms,''
Scott said.
   The straw is pasturized, and protein from soybean, peanut or
cottonseed meal is blended into the compost to provide nutrients
for the mushrooms.
   The ``seed'' for the crop is mushroom spawn, which is growing on
millet or rye when it is purchased. It is added to the straw and
covered with peat moss and limestone.
   The entire mixture is held in four-by-six-foot trays, each eight
inches tall.
   The trays are stacked to the ceilings in 45 rooms that resemble
huge walk-in refrigerators. Temperature and humidity are carefully
controlled _ at a cost of about $1 million a year, said Scott.
   The spawn grow a web of fine, white roots from which the
mushrooms sprout. Workers gently spray them to maintain moisture.
   ``It is just light watering, like rain cascading onto the
mushrooms, not like putting two fingers over the hose nozzle and
flooding it,'' Scott said.
   It takes about 36 days for the crop to reach the harvest stage,
and picking is done over the course of a month.
   About half the farm's 425 employees are pickers _ many from
Mexico and Asia _ and they gather 380,000 pounds of mushrooms a
week.
   They climb up the trays, pluck the biggest mushrooms from the
mulch, trim off the bottoms of the stems, and place many of them
directly into clear plastic baskets for supermarket display. The
less handling, the less damage to the delicate mushrooms.
   Larger baskets are used for customers like restaurant operators.
Lower quality mushrooms are sent to canning companies.
   The harvest lands in customers' hands within 24 hours, said
Scott, a 15-year veteran of the mushroom business. In addition to
white and brown mushrooms, Princeton also distributes some
specialty mushrooms like shiitake.
   Like any crop, there are threats to the mushrooms: a type of fly
will eat the spawn; too much water will cause discoloration; a
virus can wipe out production, Scott said. Technicians from the
in-house laboratory monitor 140 variables that can affect the
harvest.
   But improved varieties and growing techniques mean U.S. mushroom
growers now produce 650 million pounds a year, Scott said.

<HEAD>Hospital Workers Reach Tentative Pact, Ratification Vote Monday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A ratification vote was scheduled Monday
for 1,700 hospital workers on strike against eight private
hospitals after negotiators reached a tentative agreement on a
contract over the weekend.
   If ratified, the agreement for Local 250 of the Hospital and
Health Care Workers Union could lead to a return of hospital
technicians, licensed vocational nurses, orderlies and food service
employees back to work.
   However, the union on strike since July 26 would then have to
decide whether to cross the picket lines of 2,000 nurses on strike
since Aug. 2 at six of the medical centers.
   Union trustee Mark Splain said there is a provision in the
tentative agreement that Local 250 members would not go back to
work until the nurses' strike is settled. It was unclear whether
the provision would be strictly enforced, particularly if the
California Nurses Association strike is not quickly settled.
   The dispute between the service worker's union and Affiliated
Hospitals had centered on health benefits and sick leave granted
employees.
   ``We do think it's a fair contract,'' Splain said. ``Compromises
were made on both sides and it does restore the basic cuts in
benefits that we were fighting for. I think the membership will
ratify the contract.''
   According to a Local 250 statement issued Saturday, the proposed
two-year contract grants wage increases of 3 percent for each of
the next two years for licensed vocational nurses and so-called
second wage-tier employees.
   Technicians will get a 1.65 percent raise this year, and 3
percent next year. Some other job classifications will receive a
one-time bonus of between $200 and $300.
   Most importantly, the union said, workers will not have to pay
part of the cost of medical insurance unless they choose to see
doctors not involved in the Affiliated Hospitals' health
maintenance organization.
   The nurses' union is fighting for pay increases and improved
staffing conditions. CNA representatives have said bargaining
between the hospitals and striking nurses would quickly follow any
settlement with the service workers union.

   The measure also authorizes the shift of another $200 million
among various agencies.
   The biggest single sum, $530 million, goes to the Veterans
Administration to pay for a heavier caseload, medical care and some
increased benefits.
   Also included: $75 million for the Justice Department, chiefly
to cover expenses of rioting last year by Cuban detainees in two
federal prisons; $60 million for the Coast Guard; $55 million for
the Agriculture Department, including some drought costs; $49
million for workers who lose their jobs because of competition from
imports; $43 million for payments to miners suffering from black
lung disease; $24 million for processing of refugees, and $15
million for state unemployment programs.
