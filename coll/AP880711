   Jesse Jackson said Monday for the first time
that he would accept the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket if it
were offered to him.
   Jackson technically remained in contention for the Democratic
nomination even though Michael Dukakis has a numerical lock on a
first-ballot victory at the convention.
   He has been saying for weeks that he ought to be offered the
vice presidential nomination. But up until Monday, Jackson refused
to say whether he would take Dukakis up on such an offer.
   He broke his silence amid indications that Dukakis would
announce his choice within a few days.
   ``If it was offered to me, I would accept it,'' Jackson told
reporters after a meeting with Paul Brountas, the Dukakis aide who
has been coordinating the search for a running mate.
   Jackson said he gave Brountas the detailed personal financial
information that has been solicited from prospective running mates,
and said he offered his ``candid view as to the office of vice
president...and what I thought my qualifications would be.''
   Brountas refused to discuss the substance of the discussion,
saying only that it was ``an excellent meeting...very productive.''
   Jackson said ``it is self-evident'' that he wants to be vice
president and said he assured Brountas that he would be a loyal
second to Dukakis.
   However, he said that if he is not chosen, he would expect
further discussions with Dukakis about his role in the fall
campaign.
   Jackson has indicated in recent weeks that his forces might
stage floor fights over platform issues at the Democratic National
Convention, which opens next week.
   But he said Monday: ``We intend to have an effective,
informative convention that would inspire our nation, unify our
party and take us to victory.''
   Jackson said platform disagreements were not discussed in the
meeting with Brountas.
   Brountas returned to Boston Monday night and went to Dukakis'
Brookline home for a late-night meeting with the governor. Dukakis
had met with Brountas earlier in the day.
   Jackson has said he is the most qualified to share the ticket
with Dukakis and has called the others known to be under
consideration ``unknown quantities.''
   They include Sens. John Glenn of Ohio, Albert Gore Jr. of
Tennessee, Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Bob Graham of Florida and
Reps. Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Lee Hamilton of Indiana.
   Jackson, asked what he thought of the vice presidential
selection process, said, ``I have no basis to challenge the
integrity of Mr. Brountas or Gov. Dukakis.''
   He added, ``If this is just a charade, it is a great waste of
their time, at a time when time is precious.''
   Jackson later flew to Cincinnati for a fundraiser. He was
returning to Washington on Tuesday to address the NAACP and hold
meetings.

<TEXT>
   Three gunmen sprayed automatic gunfire
and hurled hand grenades at hundreds of tourists aboard a Greek
cruise ship Monday, killing at least nine people and wounding 98.
The attackers fled on a speedboat.
   Earlier Monday, an explosion killed two men and destroyed a car
parked near a marina where the cruise ship, the City of Poros, was
to dock in the Athens seaside surburb of Paleo Faliron.
   A senior Greek police officer, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said: ``We are assuming the two attacks are connected,
but there's no hard evidence for that so far.''
   He said no one had claimed responsibility for the ship attack.
   A Merchant Marine Ministry spokesman said 400 of the 471 people
aboard were accounted for, but some who jumped ship during the
attack were still missing. Police earlier said 571 passengers were
on the ship.
   ``People who jumped overboard to escape are still being brought
in by other ships so we don't yet know how may still be missing,''
said Piraeus Mayor Andreas Andrianopoulos.
   The ministry spokesman, who also demanded anonymity, said no
Americans were among the injured. A list of passengers was not
available, however. Harbor officials said no Americans were on the
ship.
   The ship's owner, A. Kyrtatos, could not be reached and the
company's central Athens office remained closed after the attack. A
Merchant Marine Ministry official said the company had not provided
the ship's manifest.
   The attack occurred at 8:40 p.m. (1:40 p.m. EDT) as the City of
Poros was returning from a one-day cruise to the islands of Poros,
Hydra and Aegina.
   The ministry spokesman said 15 of the injured were in serious
condition with bullet and shrapnel wounds.
   ``None of the dead tourists has been identified. Most of the
injured are French; there are no Americans injured,'' he said.
   He said 50 passengers remained hospitalized. They were 34
French, 3 Jordanians, 3 Danes, 2 Britons, 2 Norwegians, 1 Moroccan,
1 Swiss and 1 Swede. The nationalities of the other three were not
immediately known.
   Police said three people died from bullet wounds in Piraeus
hospitals and six others were found dead on the deck the cruise
ship's deck. At least three of the dead were foreigners. Only one
of the dead was immediately identified, as the ship's first mate,
Antonis Demaizis.
   Merchant Marine Minister Evangelos Yiannopoulos condemned the
attack as ``a barbarous action of a particularly hateful kind'' and
said coast guard patrols were searching harbors and marinas for the
speedboat.
   The ship had left the island of Aegina in the Saronic Gulf and
was steaming back to the Trocadero marina in Paleo Faliron, port
police said. Passengers were sunning themselves on the deck when
the gunmen opened fire.
   A Swedish passenger who asked not to be identified said he saw a
swarthy man in his early 20s pull an automatic weapon from his
backpack and open fire as he ran along the deck.
   ``Then he threw two hand grenades and fire broke out and the
deck caved in. There were burning sheets of metal falling on the
people in the saloon below,'' said the tourist, who was bruised but
otherwise unhurt.
   Passengers Jean Wogewda of Lorient, France, and his wife
Natalie, were both wounded in the gunfire. Wogewda was shot in both
legs but managed to crawl away.
   ``I was on deck when I heard automatic fire. I turned around and
was thrown into the air by the impact of the bullets hitting my
legs,'' Wogewda said as he lay in a Piraeus hospital.
   ``I saw the man who was shooting and I couldn't believe it and
thought it was a joke. When I saw others falling to the deck, it
turned out to be real.
   ``I only saw one gunman as he reloaded his weapon. Then he
hurled a grenade at the ship's smoke stack setting off a fire. Then
he approached my group and started firing at us again,'' he said.
   Police said three gunmen took part in the attack.
   Wogewda said panic set in and many passengers scattered quickly
for cover. Others grabbed life jackets and jumped over the railing
and into the water.
   In the confusion, the gunmen slipped off the liner, boarded a
speedboat that had pulled alongside and sped away, police said.
   Ships in the vicinity, including Greek navy destroyers on
maneuvers, rushed to the area, plucked passengers from the warm
Mediterranean waters and took them to the port of Piraeus, 16 miles
away.
   The 208-foot City of Poros, smoke pouring from its side, steamed
to Piraeus at full speed.
   Police said the two men killed in the explosion that destroyed
the parked car were believed to be of Arab origin. The car had been
rented to a 36-year-old Lebanese man, Hamoud Al Hamid, police said.
   The car contained explosives, hand grenades and automatic
weapons, police said.
   An amateur photographer aboard a hydrofoil passing near the City
of Poros after the gunmen fled shot film that was screened on Greek
TV. The film showed a helicoper hovering over the liner and at
least 10 smaller vessels coming to the ship's aid.
   Two weeks ago, the American military attache to Greece, Navy
Capt. William E. Nordeen, was assassinated by a booby-trapped car
that exploded as he drove past in his bullet-proof car on his way
to work. The terrorist organization November 17 claimed
responsibility.
   Four Palestinian terrorists on Oct. 7, 1985, hijacked the
Italian luxury liner Achille Lauro during a Mediterranean cruise.
The terrorists killed American passenger Leon Klinghoffer and threw
the body and the wheelchair of the 69-year-old invalid overboard.
   Italian courts later convicted seven Palestinians of planning or
carrying out the attack, including Mohammed Abbas, the leader of
the Palestine Liberation Front who was tried in absentia and
sentenced to life imprisonment.
   Abbas was on a plane carrying the four hijackers out of Egypt
when U.S. fighter planes forced the Egyptian airliner to land in
Sicily, where they were arrested. Italian magistrates said then
they didn't have enough evidence to hold Abbas and let him leave
the country Oct. 12.

   The Sandinista government on Monday
ordered U.S. Ambassador Richard Melton and seven other American
embassy officials to leave the country within 72 hours, accusing
them of state terrorism.
   It also closed the opposition newspaper La Prensa for 15 days,
shut down the Roman Catholic radio station Radio Catolica and
arrested an opposition leader.
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz on Tuesday called the
expulsions order an `` absolute outrage.'' He did not say what
action he planned to take.
   He spoke in Manila while on an Asian tour.
   Melton notified the State Department at 7 p.m. that he and the
seven staff members were given 72 hours to leave Nicaragua, said
department press officer Rudi Boone in Washington. Boone said the
department was drafting a statement.
   The developments came one day after police clashed with
thousands of demonstrators at an anti-Sandinista rally.
   President Daniel Ortega on Sunday described the demonstration as
being part of a U.S. plan to undermine his leftist government and
vowed to ``act with force'' against violations of public order.
   Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto announced the decision to expel
the Americans. He said they were engaging in ``activities
complementary to the state terrorism the administration of U.S.
President Ronald Reagan is carrying out against Nicaragua.''
   D'Escoto said he called Melton to his office Monday afternoon to
advise him of the decision, which declared the ambassador and the
seven others unwelcome. D'Escoto also said he gave Melton a sealed
letter advising Shultz of the expulsions.
   Speaking with reporters at a Foreign Ministry news conference,
D'Escoto called Melton ``a robot of the maniacal (Assistant
Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Elliott) Abrams.''
   D'Escoto's letter identified the seven other U.S. diplomats as
John E. Hope, first secretary in charge of economic and commercial
affairs; Hugh V. Simon Jr., first secretary; Delvin Junker and
David Nolan, both second secretaries; John S. Creamer and Aubrey A.
Carlson, third secrtaries and vice consuls, and Robert Bruce
Murray, an assistant attache.
   D'Escoto said U.S. Embassy officials were at Sunday's opposition
demonstration in Nandaime, about 40 miles south of Managua.
   Melton, he said, came to Nicaragua ``in his mind to fill a
leadership vacuum in this country and he became confused.''
   The government earlier accused Melton of carrying out a
destabilization plan against Nicaragua.
   Melton filled the post left vacant since July 1987, when
Ambassador Harry Bergold returned to Washington.
   It was believed to be the first time Nicaragua had declared an
American ambassador persona non grata.
   On June 6, 1983, the government expelled three U.S. diplomats
accused of taking part in an alleged plot to poison D'Escoto. The
United States responded by closing several Nicaraguan consulates in
the United States.
   Melton presented his credentials here in May. When he arrived in
Nicaragua April 12, Melton, 52, said it was a ``decisive moment in
U.S.-Nicaraguan relations.''
   La Prensa, the only opposition daily in Nicaragua, reopened Oct.
1, 1987, after being shut down by the government for more than a
year.
   The government allowed La Prensa to reopen as part of its
efforts to comply with a regional peace plan that Ortega and the
four other Central American presidents signed in August 1987. Radio
Catolica, shut down in Jan. 1, 1986, for failing to broadcast
Ortega's year-end message to the nation, also was allowed to reopen
last October.
   In closing Radio Catolica, the Interior Ministry accused the
station of ``inciting to violence, disorder and lack of respect for
constitutional government.''
   Monsignor Bismarck Carballo, the station's director, called the
order ``unjust and arbitrary.''
   An official in the Interior Ministry press office, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said police arrested Secretary-General
Miriam Arguello of the Conservative Party for ``being the principal
instigator of yesterday's events in Nandaime.''
   Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, a director of the U.S.-backed rebels
known as Contras, said in Miami earlier Monday: ``The Sandinistas
are demonstrating once again that they are not prepared for
democracy''
   Chamorro said the Contras have been negotiating in good faith
with the Sandinistas, but that continued repression inside
Nicaragua would leave them little choice but to return to armed
struggle.
   Police arrested 42 people, including Carballo's brother, in
breaking up Sunday's anti-government protest, an Interior
Department statement said Monday. The march had been authorized by
Sandinista officials beforehand.
   Police said 10 officers were hurt and that protesters threw
rocks at police, which responded with tear gas.
   Witnesses said police started the fracas.
   The Sandinistas came to power in a popular revolution in July
1979 that ended 42 years of rule by the rightist, pro-American
Somoza dynasty.
   The U.S. government backed, trained and supplied the Contras
since 1981 in their fight against the Sandinistas.
   ``This is to show the people want democracy,'' Ms. Arguello said
before the fighting broke out. Later, a civilian struck her with a
large club as a group of police applauded.
   The march was held to protest government economic policies.
   The Sandinistas have been losing popularity because of the
shattered economy and the ongoing war.

   A vote tally released Monday gave the
government party's candidate for president a majority, but the slow
count fed rumors of party infighting and fraud.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Bartlett said early Monday that Carlos
Salinas de Gortari of the governing Institutuional Revolutionary
Party, known as the PRI for its Spanish initials, had 52.89 percent
of the votes counted.
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist National Democratic Front was
second with 29.10 percent and conservative National Action Party
candidate Manuel Clouthier third with 16.68 percent, Bartlett said.
Election officials said 13.24 million votes had been counted from
Wednesday's election but did not say how many of the nation's 38
million registered voters cast ballots.
   PRI officials in Cardenas' home state of Michoacan conceded that
Cardenas won 58 percent of the vote there to Salinas' 25 percent.
Cardenas was a popular governor of the state from 1980-86.
   Party officials in Mexico City also said privately Cardenas was
expected to win in the federal capital.
   Cardenas has claimed national victory and Clouthier has claimed
to be ahead in the vote. Both accuse the government and PRI of
fraud.
   Salinas had claimed victory before any results were announced.
   Monday's release of results provoked heated protests from
opposition members of the Federal Election Commission.
   They contended at an open committee meeting that the count gave
the impression of a Salinas victory before the information had been
verified by district committees and the rest of the official
computing process.
   Bartlett, the commission chairman, retorted: ``Public opinion
demands information. Let's give information.''
   Officials said the commission still was receiving results from
district commissions on elections for the Chamber of Deputies,
which by law has precedence in counting over the Senate and
presidential races.
   Partial official returns gave 170 of the 500 seats in the lower
house to the PRI, 13 to National Action Party and two to parties
that support Cardenas.
   Clouthier on Monday said irregularities in this year's elections
made for ``the most fraudulent results in history.''
   He the violations he alleged: last-minute changes of polling
place locations; ink used to mark voters' thumbs was not indelible;
brigades of voters who went from precinct to precinct, and people
allowed to vote without showing credentials.
   Clouthier asked a nationwide referendum be held July 30-31 on
the validity of the elections.
   The main source of frustration in the slow count was the
election commission's promise before the voting that returns would
be reported the same day. Officials said the commission's computer
broke down late Wednesday and has not been used since.
   Districts began their official counts at midnight Saturday, a
time set by law.
   Opposition parties kept vigils outside district offices and the
Federal Election Commision in Mexico City in an effort to prevent
manipulation of the results.
   Even officials of the PRI, which has controlled the major
government offices since its founding in 1929, acknowledge the
count is unusually slow. Their excuses includes the computer
problem, weather and a large turnout.
   Three theories have emerged about what has gone wrong: fighting
within the PRI, negotiations with the opposition and fraud by the
governing party.
   Bartlett was an important rival of Salinas for the presidential
nomination. Salinas, one of the party's young ``technocrats,'' has
said he prefers a smaller margin of victory that is credible, but
the old guard is said to favor maintaining the party's usual 70
percent or so by whatever means necessary.
   A backstage tradeoff, perhaps an acceptance of Salinas' victory
in exchange for more opposition congressional seats, would be a
typical PRI tactic. A close associate of Salinas said there had
been ``conversations'' but not negotiations. Clouthier and Cardenas
say they would not make such trades.
   Fraud by the PRI and government has been common in Mexican
election despite laws officials say are designed to guard against
cheating.
   The strong opposition vote and post-election mobilization to
demand that it be respected reflect a political awakening in Mexico.
   Cardenas and Clouthier have urged that protests be peaceful and
legal unless the authorities provoke violence.

   The son of Polish labor leader Lech Walesa is
getting an eyeful during a summer visit to the United States, says
one of the teen-ager's hosts.
   ``He's impressed with the immensity of the tall buildings in
every city we visit and by the automobiles. Every one is different
from the next one,'' said Jan Wydro, who helped arrange the trip by
15-year-old Slawek Walesa.
   Wydro of Oil City is a volunteer with Americacares for Poland, a
foundation that sends medicine to the Communist-ruled nation, and
he met the elder Walesa last year on one of his trips to Poland.
   The Solidarity leader and his wife declined Wydro's invitation
to visit the United States, but Walesa mentioned his son, who was
studying English, might be interested.
   ``I told him the best way for his son to become proficient in
English was to come to America to learn it,'' Wydro said.
   The young Walesa is staying with Wydro's daughter, her husband
and their 17-year-old son in Cooperstown, and is picking up English
``by osmosis,'' Wydro said.
   The second-oldest of Walesa's eight children attended Mass on
Sunday at St. Leocadia in Wilmerding, near Pittsburgh, and was the
honored guest of the Polish congregation at a luncheon reception.
He plans to visit a polka festival Saturday in Pittsburgh and
attend a Pirates baseball game Sunday.

<HEAD>Bush To Propose Strict Conflict-of-Interest Code For Public
Officials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush, whose
presidential campaign was embarrassed by the legal difficulties
surrounding Attorney General Edwin Meese III, plans to propose a
tough new conflict-of-interest code for public officials, aides say.
   Bush's proposals, still being drafted, will build upon his
previous advocacy of a strong ethics office within the White House,
according to aides who spoke only on the condition of anonymity.
   The vice president, the certain Republican presidential nominee,
will spell out his proposals in a speech later this month in New
Mexico to the Business and Professional Women's Association, the
aides said.
   With the announcement last week by Meese that he would resign
this summer, Bush will make ethics in government a major thrust of
his fall presidential campaign, the aides said.
   Meese said he would resign even while claiming that an
independent counsel's report had vindicated him of any wrongdoing.
   Meese's legal difficulties had been a source of concern for the
Bush campaign, and sources said that Bush was relieved that the
attorney general had decided to step down. In a short statement
last week, Bush praised Meese for doing ``the right thing'' in
resigning.
   Now, with the question of Meese resolved, Bush hopes to take the
offensive on the ethics issue, campaign sources said.
   In addition to the vice president's proposal of a strict
conflict of interest code, Bush campaign officials are seeking to
have a denunciation of House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, included
in the 1988 GOP platform, the sources said.
   Bush and other Republicans have been outspoken in their
criticism of Wright over alleged financial irregularities in the
allocation of proceeds from Wright's book of political reflections.
   While details of Bush's conflict-of-interest proposal are still
sketchy, aides said the plan would clearly spell out rules that
future Cabinet members and other presidential appointees would have
to follow.
   Bush associates said the vice president was stung by accusations
last week by Democratic Chairman Paul Kirk that he had used public
funds to pay for campaign appearances.
   Bush aides deny the allegations, asserting that campaign funds
have paid for the trips cited by Kirk. The Bush aides said the Kirk
allegations had further motivated Bush to propose a strong
conflict-of-interest code.
   The vice president spent most of his weekend here at his
oceanside home resting.
   In his sole public appearance, Bush told a Lithuanian festival
that recent reforms undertaken by the Soviet Union raise hopes that
the Soviets may relax their grip on Eastern European nations.
   ``This is a time of change in the Soviet Union, and for the
Lithuanian people, it is a time for hope,'' Bush said.
   He spoke at a Lithuanian Franciscan monastery that was
established in 1947 by Franciscan fathers who escaped from
Lithuania when that country fell to invading Soviet troops.
   ``The United States has always condemned the violation of your
national sovereignty, and in the years ahead we will never condone
the forced occupation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union,'' Bush said.
   He challenged the Soviets to make good on their pledges of
reform by allowing more freedoms in Eastern Europe.
   ``But if this is a time for hope, it is not a time for
complacency or weakness,'' Bush said.
   ``Only the United States is strong enough and committed enough
to stand up for the freedoms of oppressed people all over the
world,'' he said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Dukakis Goes On The Counterattack</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis, recognizing that
George Bush has succeeded in recent efforts to tar his image, has
begun countering with increasing attacks on the Republican vice
president.
   Even with the question of selecting a running mate hanging over
him and obscuring broader campaign themes, Dukakis has expanded and
strengthened his criticisms of Bush.
   Campaigning across the West in his final pre-convention swing
this past weekend, Dukakis hit at Bush with accusations that his
no-tax pledge was a sham, ridiculed him on plant-closing
legislation, needled him for backing off his proclaimed opposition
to offshore drilling, and even associated him through the
administration with the Pentagon procurement scandal.
   While it was sometimes delivered in Dukakis' soft-spoken,
understated manner, or buried deep in his customary stump speeches,
Dukakis' comments were the result of a decision within the campaign
to be more forceful in answering a month of attacks from Bush.
   The vice president has been going after Dukakis regularly on his
Massachusetts record, saying his opponent supported tax increases
and furloughs for convicted murderers.
   ``While they're throwing high inside fastballs, you need to
throw some brush-back pitches too,'' said campaign adviser Kirk
O'Donnell, using a baseball analogy. ``You don't want to see Bush
getting his spikes in so deep he controls the plate. You've got to
keep him honest.''
   A Washington political hand brought in to advise the Dukakis
campaign on communicating its message, O'Donnell traveled with the
Massachusetts governor last week and was advocating a toughened
response to the vice president.
   The move, which other aides referred to as a decision to
``engage'' the vice president, is a result of Bush's apparent
success in his own attacks.
   ``Bush has been banging him around on specific issues to try to
paint him as a liberal, and with some success,'' O'Donnell said.
   In fact, the Dukakis campaign appears in the midst of a critical
transition period, as it continues to grapple with Jesse Jackson
and convention politics but at the same time points ahead to the
real campaign _ against the Republicans.
   After enjoying a lofty double-digit lead over Bush in public
opinion polls during much of the spring, polls in the last several
weeks have shown a narrower lead.
   While the change is in part due to the end of the primary
season, during which Dukakis had the aura of a winner every week,
O'Donnell's comments suggested a recognition within the Dukakis
campaign that some of Bush's darts had hit their mark.
   Dukakis, in an interview with the Los Angeles Times, said he had
concluded he will have to match Bush's negative attacks on him. And
the Massachusetts governor agreed with the suggestion the fall
presidential campaign as a result could be ``nasty.''
   ``Yes, it's unfortunate,'' Dukakis said. ``But as I did in the
primary, you give fair warning, you try to keep it positive, but if
(attacks) continue, you've got to respond.''
   Dukakis' sharpest response has been on the issue of Bush's
promise to oppose new taxes, an assertion Bush has used to depict
his Democratic rival as likely to raise taxes if elected.
   Dukakis has pointed to Bush's support for legislation on health
care and trade that would raise taxes and fees for some Americans,
saying both candidates support the changes but that Bush isn't
being candid in acknowledging they are taxes.
   ``Back where I come from, if it looks like a duck and walks like
a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck,'' Dukakis said,
ridiculing Bush in Los Angeles.
   ``I want the vice president to stand up and tell the truth,
which is, that he and the president supported a $6 billion tax
increase,'' he said Sunday.
   Dukakis has been critical of the Reagan administration, and Bush
by association, for months over Attorney General Edwin Meese, the
Iran-Contra affair, the war on drugs and support for Panama
strongman Manuel Noriega.
   But he displayed a reluctance to engage in real responses to
Bush _ and during the late primaries responded more than once by
mildly saying Bush should quit criticizing others.
   ``He's now looking beyond the convention,'' said Dukakis press
secretary Dayton Duncan. ``He's starting to really look forward to
it being him and Bush.''

<HEAD>Vice Chair Of House Democratic Caucus Warns Against Overconfidence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Democrats start packing their bags for
Atlanta and the coronation of Michael Dukakis, Ohio Democratic
congresswoman Mary Rose Oakar is hoping they leave one item behind:
overconfidence about beating George Bush.
   ``Everyone thinks he's sort of wimpy. I don't see him that
way,'' Oakar said in an interview. ``He's a war hero. Wait until
you see them pull all that stuff out.''
   ``I have some great anxieties that we think this is our year and
we're not going to have the zeal and lust to win that we should
have,'' said Oakar, the vice chair of the House Democratic Caucus,
which Dukakis will appear before on Wednesday.
   Oakar is worried the vice president is already making moves to
shore up relations with two groups never totally comfortable with
President Reagan: women and the elderly.
   The six-term Cleveland congresswoman, also a leader of the
party's platform committee, said the image of Bush as a preppy
milquetoast doesn't square with the popular and savvy GOP
politician she has come to know on Capitol Hill.
   At the annual House gym parties where Bush shows up to have his
picture taken with Democrats and Republicans alike, ``he's one of
the boys,'' said Oakar.
   ``Frankly, on a one-to-one basis, he is not the so-called
elitist type that he appears to be. ... He is much more appealing
in a smaller crowd than he is on Dan Rather's show,'' she said.
   ``I think George Bush is much more formidable than a lot of
people give him credit for,'' the liberal congresswoman said.
   Ohio, with its 23 electoral votes, is rated by both sides as a
key battleground. Ohio Sen. John Glenn has figured prominently in
speculation about possible running mates for Dukakis.
   ``Bush has been laying the groundwork for reconciling all of the
problems Reagan always had, such as the women's problem and the
elderly issue _ two areas that ought to be natural Democratic
constituencies,'' Oakar said.

<HEAD>Meese Complains of News Leaks on Special Prosecutor's Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III is
complaining about news leaks of a special prosecutor's report less
than a week after he declared that the document vindicated him.
   Meese, who has announced he will resign by early August, said
Sunday that whoever leaked details of the report should be held in
contempt of court.
   Meese also denied a claim by his former deputy that he offered
his close friend E. Robert Wallach a job in the Justice Department
while Meese was aware Wallach was under criminal investigation.
   Wallach, a lawyer and longtime Meese confidant, is awaiting
trial in New York on a racketeering indictment accusing him and two
others of taking illegal payments from Wedtech Corp., a Bronx,
N.Y., defense contractor, to influence government officials.
   Independent counsel James McKay filed his report on Meese in
federal court last week, an indication that he does not plan to
seek indictments of the attorney general. The report is still under
court seal, but both Meese and President Reagan maintained last
week that it vindicates the attorney general.
   However, The New York Times on Saturday quoted portions of the
report raising ethical questions about Meese's conduct, including
the job offer to Wallach.
   The Times said the report gives a detailed account of
discussions between Meese and Wallach about the possibility of
Wallach joining the Justice Department, although Meese denied to
both the FBI and a grand jury that he made Wallach a job offer. In
both instances, Meese later changed his testimony, acknowledging
some discussion of a job for Wallach, the Times said, quoting the
report.
   ``At no time whatsoever was there any thought whatsoever of Bob
Wallach taking any job in the Justice Department while there was
any possibility he was under criminal investigation,'' Meese said
Sunday on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press.''
   Meese acknowledged, however, that there had been some discussion
of a possible job for Wallach ``which went out of my mind after I
found out about the criminal investigation.''
   But the special prosecutor's report, according to the Times,
concluded that the job offer remained open even after Meese became
aware of the investigation on April 6, 1987.
   It quoted then-Deputy Attorney General Arnold I. Burns as
telling investigators he was ``astonished'' when Meese told him
after that date that the offer to make Wallach counselor to the
attorney general was still good.
   The report said that Meese on April 17, 1987, denied to the FBI
that Wallach was being considered for a job but four days later
called the FBI to correct his statement, acknowledging that a job
had been offered two weeks earlier, the Times reported.
   Meese also told a grand jury last October that he had not
offered Wallach a job since July 1985 but quickly corrected his
statement when he was shown a copy of an FBI report on his previous
statements.
   The Times also said the report showed Meese was ``closely
involved'' in discussions about a proposed $1 billion Iraqi oil
pipeline. It said he gave conflicting accounts of whether he knew
of alleged plans to have pipeline funds funneled directly to
Israel's Labor Party in a bribe scheme.
   Meese said Sunday that his involvement in the pipeline matter
was limited to asking then-national security adviser Robert
McFarlane to talk to Wallach and responding to a letter from
then-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres about the proposal.
   Meese criticized the Times for quoting from the report before
his lawyers have had a chance to respond.
   He also refused to answer questions about the report's contents,
noting that court orders prohibit discussion until it is unsealed.
   ``Anybody who leaked that report should be held in contempt,''
he said.

<HEAD>Recycling Growing in US, Europe</HEAD>
<HEAD>By CARL HARTMAN</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Europe and the United States are beginning to
adopt similar strategies for disposing of wastes, spurred by common
recognition that there's not enough space to bury it all and
burning causes too much pollution.
   ``For centuries, Western Europeans marveled at the luxury of
available land in North America,'' says a report from the
non-profit Institute for Local Self-Reliance. ``This luxury allowed
for ready access to disposal sites for solid wastes, as well as for
a casual disregard of the maintenance of soil fertility for
agriculture.''
   But as that luxury decreases, new methods are being tried.
   A company in Oakland, Calif., has long collected wine bottles,
washed them and sold them back to vintners at less than the cost of
new bottles. Now the practice is spreading to Michigan,
Massachusetts and New York.
   Italy has passed a law that in 1991 will ban all packaging
unless it can be recycled or will decompose naturally.
   The institute report favors recycling, but says little has been
invested in it and that some professional planners are skeptical.
Neil Seldman, one of the authors, nevertheless sees recycling as
the path that must be followed.
   ``You'll have the bottle manufacturers asking for a national
bottle bill because they don't want to have to deal with 50
different bottle bills, so I would say that within a few years we
will have that,'' he predicted.
   State bottle bills typically require consumers to pay a small
deposit which is refunded by shops when the empties are returned.
The bills have been strongly opposed by business interests,
especially container manufacturers.
   Brenda Platt, the institute's staff engineer, said that some
communities, states and governments are now setting a three-tiered
set of priorities for disposing of waste:
   _First, ``source reduction,'' or discouraging the use of
materials that become waste. Seldman cited a proposal in
Philadelphia that would put one tax on bottles, and a double tax on
``secondary packaging,'' the cardboard or plastic that goes around
a six-pack.
   _``Source separation,'' the separate handling of different kinds
of waste in both homes and businesses. Ms. Platt spoke approvingly
of a ``three container'' system in some communities of West
Germany, with a green container for one type of waste.
   ``If you don't put your recyclables in the green can, they'll
take away the green container and give you maybe a black one, and
you're labeled as the slob of the neighborhood,'' she said. ``Peer
pressure can do a lot to encourage recycling.''
   _Large-scale burning and burial of waste only as a last resort.
   ``Iowa, New York, the Netherlands, Sweden and Italy have
endorsed this hierarchy,'' she said.
   The report says the average American produces about 1,300 pounds
of waste annually, compared with a little over 1,100 pounds for the
average West German. The U.S. figure is for 1986, the German figure
for 1984.
   Disposal methods vary widely. The United States burns only about
5 percent of its waste, while Switzerland burns more than 60
percent. The United States still can bury nearly 85 percent, while
mountainous Switzerland can find space for less than 20 percent.
   Switzerland recycles over 20 percent or uses it as compost for
farmers, twice the proportion in the United States.
   The institute is a research organization that serves local
governments, citizen groups and industry. The West German
government's Marshall Fund of the United States financed the study.

<HEAD>Drought to Juggle Agriculture Earnings, Income</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In agriculture, somebody always gets more or
less than the next guy, and the government says drought is no
exception.
   ``The drought will result in a substantial redistribution of
earnings,'' the Interagency Drought Policy Committee said in its
July report to President Reagan. ``Farmers outside drought areas
will reap higher incomes from higher crop prices.''
   But the report added: ``Farmers in drought areas will have
reduced quantities of crops to sell and will also receive smaller
income support (deficiency) payments as a result of rising prices.''
   One of the tasks facing government is to ensure the fairness of
drought relief, so that some farmers don't harvest
taxpayer-financed windfalls while others see their incomes shrivel
in the dry winds of summer.
   Farmers who lose tomato crops may feel that they are just as
deserving as those whose corn is lost to July heat. So, Congress
and the administration are looking at ways to help all distressed
farmers, including those who grow ``non-program'' crops which are
not covered by acreage controls, price supports and deficiency
payments.
   Some advocate using money saved from lower deficiency payments
and other reduced program benefits to spread among drought-savaged
farmers.
   Overall, the Agriculture Department had expected to spend around
$17 billion on those commodity operations, but now _ because of
drought-induced higher prices _ the deficiency payments will be
much less. The drought has already chewed across some of the areas
that have benefited most from the annual subsidies.
   According to USDA budget officials, the net spending for
commodity programs in the 1988 fiscal year that runs through Sept.
30 was projected at nearly $17.7 billion, down from $22.4 billion
in 1987 and the record of $25.8 billion in 1986.
   For fiscal 1989, or the year that will begin this Oct. 1,
outlays were projected at $17.1 billion. That is the money, for the
most part, that will cover the deficiency payments and other
benefits farmers will get for 1988 production.
   Revised estimates have not been officially announced by USDA,
but some private analysts suggest that outlays may drop to a range
of $8 billion to $12 billion, depending on the final outcome of the
1988 harvests and market prices.
   The department's Economic Research Service, working from those
and other sources, looks at farm income on a calendar year basis,
so the figures are not exactly comparable. However, the agency also
has been revising its estimates to reflect drought impact.
   For example, according to agency economists, direct government
payments to farmers were initially expected to be in the range of
$13 billion to $15 billion in calendar 1988, down from about $17
billion in 1987. That range has since been trimmed to $12 billion
to $14 billion, and further adjustments are expected.
   Government subsidies in the form of direct payments _ including
cash and redeemable payment-in-kind certificates _ have made up a
larger part of farmers' overall cash income in recent years.
   In calendar 1987, for example, when net cash income was a record
$56 billion, direct federal payments totaled $17 billion.
   According to other figures provided by USDA at the request of a
reporter, about 10 states normally account for nearly two-thirds of
the total commodity payments each year. A few move in and out of
the top 10, but analysts say the proportion continues about the
same each year.
   In 1987, the top 10 states collected about $10.6 billion, or
more than 63 percent of payments nationally totaling more than
$16.7 billion. All have been hit by this year's drought.
   Iowa farmers headed the list in 1987 with farm subsidies
totaling about $1.91 billion. Others in the top 10 included:
Illinois, $1.48 billion; Texas, $1.44 billion; Nebraska, $1.27
billion; Minnesota, $1.19 billion; Kansas, $965.4 million; North
Dakota, $719 million; Indiana, $670.2 million; South Dakota, $503.9
million; and Missouri, $489.8 million.

<HEAD>Lawmakers In Battle For Powerful Appropriations Seat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A battle is brewing behind the scenes on
Capitol Hill as three New England lawmakers fight for a single
vacancy on the powerful House Appropriations Committee.
   The struggle has taken on more importance than the usual
jockeying for coveted committee assignments because it pits two
Massachusetts Democrats who had been mentioned as possible
successors to Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis in 1990 _ Reps.
Joseph P. Kennedy II and Chester G. Atkins.
   Kennedy, Atkins and Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, D-Conn., began
lobbying fellow Democrats for their support in April just days
after Rep. Edward P. Boland, D-Mass., announced he would not seek a
19th term, according to another Massachusetts Democrat, Rep. Brian
Donnelly.
   Donnelly, a member of the House Steering and Policy Committee,
which recommends members for new committee assignments, confirmed
information obtained from various congressional sources.
   Donnelly and other lawmakers said the House Democratic
leadership has all but promised to keep Boland's appropriations
seat within New England, but only if the region's Democratic
members can rally behind one candidate. If they cannot, they risk
losing the seat.
   Seats on the Appropriations Committee are among the most coveted
in Congress because of its control over spending. Committee members
are well positioned to include federal money for favored home state
projects.
   Many consider Atkins the favorite. His home state of
Massachusetts boasts a majority of the region's Democratic House
members, and he could reasonably expect an added amount of loyalty
stemming from his position as chairman of the state party. The
second-term congressman is stressing his experience as chairman of
the Massachusetts Senate Ways and Means Committee.
   Kennedy is only a freshman, and it would be unusual for a member
so low on the seniority ladder to secure an appropriations seat.
But Kennedy is considered by some observers to be a ``wild card''
because of his family's legacy.
   ``There's no question when you're a Kennedy you bring special
advantages to the process. That's a fact of life,'' said Morrison,
who works with Kennedy on the House Banking Committee. ``He has
more clout than the average freshman.''
   Kennedy declined to comment.
   Morrison has been lobbying members aggressively, perhaps in the
hopes that he could put together a coalition of Connecticut
Democrats and other non-Massachusetts members while Kennedy and
Atkins split the Massachusetts vote, one lawmaker suggested.
   The battle has already had ramifications on the Massachusetts
gubernatorial race that is expected to develop for 1990 if Dukakis
does not lose his quest for the presidency and decide to seek a
fourth term at the Statehouse.
   Atkins' recent statement that he would not run for governor in
1990 was seen by many Democrats as an attempt to convince House
Speaker Jim Wright and New England lawmakers that he intends to
stay in the House, and therefore is deserving of the appropriations
seat.
   ``That's correct,'' Atkins said. ``They wanted to be assured
that whoever gets that seat that they have a long-term commitment
to the House. That's the kind of committee where when you get on it
and you work you become'' more effective over time. ``My colleagues
wanted to know that I was going to be in a position where I could
do that.''
   Atkins, in a recent interview, stressed that the competition has
been friendly and that all three members have discussed the
position among themselves.
   ``The campaign is being run in a very low-key way so that we can
avoid any kind of divisions that would make it difficult to keep
the seat in the region,'' he said. ``We've been able to maintain
very excellent relations with each other and cooperation with each
other. It's very polite, genteel and low key.''
   Donnelly said the contest is ``very much still up in the air.''
   ``Most members are not going to make commitments until after the
elections because these are very difficult personal decisions to
make. These are not political decisions, they're personal
decisions,'' he said.

   Sen. John Glenn and Rep. George Miller rent
rooms, but that's about as far as that particular comparison can go.
   Glenn, the former astronaut from Ohio who is under consideration
for the Democratic vice presidential nomination, says his interests
in two hotel management companies brought him income of $287,349
last year.
   At the other end of the lodging business, Miller, a California
Democrat, collected between $5,000 and $15,000 in 1987 from three
House colleagues who rented rooms in his townhouse near the Capitol.
   These are some of the details contained in 1987 financial
disclosure statements filed recently by Glenn, Miller and a handful
of other lawmakers who received permission to submit their reports
after the May 15 deadline.
   Glenn's report, which like others gave most information only in
broad dollar ranges, showed that he remained one of the wealthiest
members of the Senate, which is frequently called ``the
millionaires' club.''
   Listing a myriad of investments, he reported assets of from
$7,753,163 to more than $15 million, with liabilities at no more
than $865,000. Glenn said his income last year was between
$1,280,906 and $2,704,480, including his congressional pay of
$87,483 and Marine Corps pension of $16,584.
   Miller reported earnings last year of from $122,397 to $132,397,
including his official salary, $29,914 in speaking and writing fees
and rent from roommates Marty Russo, D-Ill., Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., and Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
   Miller's only listed assets were his houses in Washington and
Martinez, Calif., worth a combined $200,000 to $500,000. His
liabilities, mortgages on the properties, were from $60,000 to
$115,000.
   His only reported gift was a membership in the Big ``C''
Athletic Club in Concord, Calif., worth $1,000.
   Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who chairs the Senate
Agriculture Committee, said he received $39,927 from speaking and
writing fees, with at least $24,959 coming from farm organizations
and agribusinesses.
   He also got free trips from the Chicago Board of Trade, the farm
commodities trading market, but the Windy City wasn't on the
itinerary. One Board of Trade trip took Leahy and his son to West
Palm Beach, Fla. Another transported the senator and his wife to
London.
   Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., reported $49,255 in speaking and
writing honoraria in 1987. His free trips, paid for by business
groups, took him to the mountain resort of White Sulphur Springs,
W.Va.; Sun Valley, Idaho; Ft. Myers, Fla.; Monterey, Calif.; and to
Salt Lake City for a charity skiing event.
   Among Quayle's reported gifts were $287 worth of golf
merchandise at the Kemper Open in suburban Maryland and $825 in
golfing gear from a constituent, professional golfer Fuzzy Zoeller
of New Albana, Ind.
   The depressed condition of U.S. oil and gas production was
evidenced by the disclosure statement filed by Sen. Malcolm Wallop,
R-Wyo. His petroleum leases on at least 912 acres of land brought
him just $74.42 in royalty payments.
   Wallop also reported income of at least $216,433, assets of at
least $1.46 million, liabilities of at least $500,000 and between
$995,000 and $1.9 million worth of sales in stocks and bonds.
   Even more active in the market was Rep. James Scheuer, D-N.Y.,
who bought from $5.6 million to $11.5 million in securities and
sold from $2.5 million to $4.8 million worth. He showed capital
gains ranging from $284,102 to $666,000 and dividend income of
$14,552 to $57,000.
   Rep. Robert Garcia's assets included a legal defense fund
containing between $5,000 and $15,000 to pay lawyers representing
him in the ongoing Wedtech defense contracting probe.
   The New York Democrat has been under investigation since
February 1987 but is ``hopeful and confident he'll be exonerated,''
said his spokesman, Bill Danvers. Garcia has not been indicted in
the case.

   Travis Newsome has been competing in the
World Championship Domino Tournament since 1978. His diligence
finally paid off.
   Newsome, of Kansas City, Mo., beat E.H. Edwards of Waldo, Ark.,
2-1 in an hourlong, best-of-three match Sunday to capture the
singles title. Newsome won $4,000, while Edwards got $1,500 for his
second-place finish.
   Newsome said he would use his prize money to defray some of the
expenses he has incurred traveling to the south Alabama town of
Andalusia, which has played host to the tournament since 1976.
   A Mississippi team won the doubles championship and $4,000.
James Morgan of Bassfield and Harold Marler of Clinton beat Ralph
Foster of Mesquite, Texas, and Daryl McClain of Summerall, Miss.,
2-1. Foster and McClain received $1,500.
   Nearly 500 people from as far away as California competed for
some $45,000 in prizes. The competitors, ranging in age from 7 to
107, gathered at Lurleen B. Wallace State Junior College's
gymnasium for the event, which is sponsored by the Andalusia Rotary
Club and the local chamber of commerce.
   Charles Tomberlin, co-chairman of the tournament, is credited
with creating the domino championship.
   ``They call me Dr. Domino because in 1976, when the Bicentennial
committee came around asking clubs to sponsor a Bicentennial
project, I jokingly suggested a domino tournament to my fellow
Rotarians,'' said Tomberlin, who remembered playing the game as a
child.
   Tomberlin said he sent letters to George Bush and Michael
Dukakis asking the two likely presidential nominees to play each
other in this year's tournament.
   ``I never got a response,'' he said, laughing. ``We probably
could have really packed them in if those two came.''

<HEAD>Tests Show B-1 Bombers May Fall Short of Performing Mission</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's B-1 bombers may not be able to
fulfill their mission of penetrating Soviet air defenses in the
1990s, according to congressional and administration officials
citing new test results.
   Recent tests have shown problems with the B-1's Electronic
Countermeasures, or ECM, system used to foil enemy radar, House
Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., said in a
memorandum sent to panel members and disclosed on Sunday.
   Plans to build the B-1 were shelved during the Carter
administration but revived under President Reagan as he persuaded
Congress that a penetrating bomber was needed to bridge the gap
between the aging fleet of B-52s and the B-2 or Stealth Bomber
expected to become operational in the 1990s.
   Reagan won approval for a version called the B-1B by pledging to
keep the first 100 planes under a $28 billion ceiling. The planes
became operational in 1986, although they are still undergoing
tests and adjustments.
   Aspin said in his two-page memorandum said that ``ECM has been
the chief question mark in the B-1B's future as a penetrating
bomber. It looks like we have our answer. The Air Force is now
admitting that, because of a design flaw, it will never work as
advertised.''
   The memo, excerpts of which were obtained by The Associated
Press, quoted a letter from Air Force officials to the committee
late last month saying that `there are limitations within the
current system architecture.''
   Aspin said in his memo that ``the Air Force acknowledged that
those limitations will prevent the B-1B ECM from ever achieving
full operational capability.''
   Despite the problems, Air Force officials said the plane should
be able to penetrate Soviet air space until the introduction of the
Stealth bomber, which is designed to appear as small as possible on
enemy radar screens.
   Air Force officials confirmed the information in Aspin's memo,
but a spokesman, Capt. Jay de Frank, said ``the current round of
flight tests verified that the most important ECM techniques work,
giving us a high degree of confidence that we can penetrate enemy
defense and accomplish our mission.''
   The Air Force is trying to achieve what it calls Mod-1
capabilities on the bomber's ECM system, meeting specifications
that were supposed to be achieved in 1986, according to Air Force
and congressional officials.
   The current hardware aboard the plane is not capable of meeting
higher Mod-2 capabilities, those thought necessary for the plane to
cope with expected improvements in Soviet air defenses by the
1990s, congressional sources said.
   ``The current system has a limitation which precludes achieving
Mod-2 capabilities without modifying the hardware,'' de Frank said.
``We are evaluating options to address these limitations.''
   The exact nature of the limitations is classified for security
reasons, but one congressional source said ECM devices aboard the
B-1 simply do not have the capacity to handle the job.
   ``It's a little like trying to pour a 12-ounce drink into a
7-ounce glass. It just can't be done,'' said one source, speaking
on condition of anonymity. ``They are a long way from being where
they were supposed to be in 1986.''
   The system is designed to receive signals from Soviet radar and
jam them, masking the B-1 and protecting it from Soviet air
defenses, sources said. The current system can cope with what the
Air Force calls ``significant'' threats, but cannot handle
``secondary'' threats.
   Those threats, although secondary, may be sufficient to prompt
the Air Force to alter or reroute the missions of some of the B-1s
to increase the probability that they could return safely, the
sources said.
   ``We had always thought we could correct the problems. But we
got test results within the last six weeks which showed a basic
problem with the architecture of the ECM,'' said one administration
source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Aspin has been critical of the B-1, and last year released a
report citing shortcomings in the ECM and other systems. In 1987,
Congress approved a $600 million program to test and correct the
defects by 1991.
   One widely publicized problem, leakage from the B-1's fuel
tanks, has already been fixed, and solutions are thought possible
for other headaches, including flight instability and poor
coordination between its terrain-following radar and guidance
controls, administration and congressional sources said.

<HEAD>Crown of the North Sea Oil Trade Worn Uneasily by Aberdeen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ABERDEEN, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roses, not derricks, bedeck the
streets of this capital of North Sea oil, and the tough Scots who
live here are proud of that.
   Oil changed many lives, made some people rich, and pushed out
the ailing fishing industry, but it has not spoiled the city
sandwiched betweeen the rivers Don and Dee or changed Aberdonians,
they say.
   Aberdeen lives with oil, not for it, and felt largely unscathed
by the two decades of vast changes it brought _ at least until last
week's oil rig tragedy claimed 166 lives, including many
Abderdonians.
   ``Aberdeen doesn't see itself as an oil town,'' says the Rev.
James Stewart of the Kirk (church) of St. Nicholas, the seat of the
city's ancient Church of Scotland congregation. ``It's a town on
which oil has made a deep impact, but it has sufficiently deep
roots in the past and in the hinterland to see itself as something
more.''
   The city of 214,000 residents stresses this in a brochure for
tourists: ``Since the discovery of North Sea oil, Aberdeen has
justifiably earned the title of Europe's offshore oil capital.
   ``The city, however, has not been spoiled by this new industry
... Only occasionally can an oil rig be seen far out on the horizon
_ under tow to a new location or at anchor waiting a new contract.''
   Stewart's stone church looms over a city built of granite, from
rowhouses to two early 16th century universities. Splashes of color
come only from miles of roses lining the streets for Aberdeen's
11th attempt to win the ``Britain in Bloom'' competition.
   Aberdeen is a tough, no-frills city.
   ``It's a town where the character of the people in some ways is
a reflection of the stone of which the city is built,'' says
Stewart, a Scotsman who arrived in the city a few years after the
oil boom began in the early 70s.
   ``Granite is a very hard stone, and there's a kind of
independent toughness about the Aberdonians. It's not a city which
wears its heart on its sleeve.''
   In the days after Wednesday's oil rig disaster, that seemed true.
   Memorial services were held and some flags flew at half-staff;
but shoppers thronged the main street as crying seagulls drifted
overhead.
   The city mourned, but privately.
   ``We're a close-knit people,'' said Kathleen Skene, head
bartender at the Aberdeen Petroleum Club, once the elite haven of
North Sea pioneers, oilwise Americans and, since the world oil
slump, a haunt of fish merchants and businessmen.
   ``Most people know someone or know of someone who's been lost.
It certainly affected a lot of lives,'' she said.
   ``Once Aberdeen folk were considered lucky to have oil on their
doorstep,'' said the Sunday Post newspaper, which calls itself
Scotland's largest Sunday paper. ``Now like many mining communities
before them, they have found the Earth doesn't give up its riches
without a price.''
   The first North Sea oil was struck in 1969 and brought to shore
in 1975. At the time, Aberdeen was in decline.
   But from 1970 to 1984, jobs rose by 54 percent, house prices
rose nearly 20 percent a year and annual passengers through
Aberdeen airport rose 1,370 percent to more than a million, the
city says.
   With oil came a lot of outsiders _ what the Aberdonians call
``in-aboot-comers,'' in their dialect _ especially from the United
States.
   ``I think when oil first started we definitely resented the
Americans because they had the good jobs, they made the money, and
a lot of Aberdonians didn't benefit,'' said Ms. Skene. ``Not
everyone made money.''
   Others welcomed oil from the start.
   ``It meant a complete turnaround from fishing to the oil
scene,'' said manager Frank Naughton of North Star Fishing Co., a
major fishing fleet now used mostly as oil support boats. ``With
the decline in fishing, personally I'd say it was a good thing oil
came in.''
   Since the world oil slump, many Americans have gone and the jobs
are not as well paid. But the city still thrives, and until last
week, had settled quietly into oil work.
   Still, the Rev. Stewart believes Aberdeen's granite spirit will
help it face up to the disaster.
   ``It's sobering, but I think it's part of the character of the
people here to pick up the threads and make the best of it.''

<HEAD>Phalanx Of Flamingos Appears On Flats</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KNIK RIVER MUD FLATS, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After flailing at mosquitoes
and sloshing shin-deep through silty water so cold it hurts, the
little band of artists schlop-schlop-schlops through the mud,
keeping an eye on the tide.
   Then they drop their bulky bags and get to work as motorists on
a bridge gawk.
   In minutes, the brown of the vast mud flats is broken by row
upon row of color. A plethora of pink, a bevy of birds _ a phalanx
of flamingos. Plastic in the mud. The transformation becomes art,
courtesy of The Flamingo Institute.
   ``This is the result of a long Alaska winter,'' Robert Wick said
with a grin. He and fellow art teacher H.J. Slider founded the
``institute'' a year or so ago. They prefer to call themselves
curators. ``We wondered what we could do as artists to break up the
monotony.''
   They acquired about 100 plastic flamingos of the yard variety
and periodically set up the flock in unusual places, for art's sake
or for money. But they say they are performance artists, serious
artists _ in the same vein as Christo, the sculptor who
periodically wraps islands or bridges with plastic and fabric.
   In the mud of Knik River, the chevrons of flamingos are slashes
of color. Cars slow down. Occasionally one honks.
   One minute the birds are there. The next, with the tide
changing, they are back in their bags and headed for high ground as
art gives way to Mother Nature.
   Slider said she sees the flamingos not as birds but as a way to
splash pink across Alaska's drab wilderness. Flamingos just happen
to be the medium to transport the color. ``They're handy and
durable and versatile,'' she said.
   Wick said he sees the birds as a way to inject satire and humor
into art.
   ``We're not dealing with it as flamingo formations. We deal with
it as a color,'' he said. ``There's a whole lot of absurdity in
this; the height of kitsch. But you can turn it around and make a
statement with it. The bottom line is, I guess, pure aesthetics.''
   The institute claims about a dozen active members and a few
dozen supporters. The active members ante up $10.
   For about $50, the institute in the past has set up about a
dozen ``flamingoings'' for birthdays, weddings or other occasions.
``About four were more serious art pieces. The rest were
commercial,'' Wick said. ``The only reason we do these gags is to
get money. We're raping our art to get more flamingoes.''
   The birds, bought at $8 a pair, made their first appearance in
August, on Anchorage's park strip, where they were set up like an
orchestra, Wick said.
   With a few exceptions, the institute workers have had few
problems setting up the flock. A state Department of Fish and Game
worker questioned them about having a permit when they set up the
flamingos in a bird refuge south of Anchorage, and officials
refused permission for an installation up on top of a visitors
center in Anchorage.
   ``They said we were an irresponsible group,'' said institute
member Alice Gant.
   Once the birds are set up, institute members usually hover
nearby to protect their flock. ``People will carry them away,''
Slider said.
   Wick said he envisions setting up a flock anchored offshore _ a
flotilla of flamingoes. Or perhaps a flock on a glacier.
   ``You just don't know where they are going to show up,'' Slider
said.

<HEAD>Episcopal Church Body OKs Proposal On Ordination of Homosexuals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A legislative body of the Episcopal Church passed
an proposal Sunday on the ordination of homosexuals that left both
proponents and opponents saying they had prevailed.
   The House of Deputies _ one of the church's two governing bodies
_ passed an amendment during the church's 69th General Convention
that states ``no one shall be denied access to the selection
process for ordination except provided by canons of this church.''
   In order to become part of the church's canon law, the deputies'
amendment would have to be adopted by the House of Bishops, the
church's other governing body, before the convention comes to an
end Monday.
   Currently, official church canon law contains no provisions
barring homosexuals from being ordained, but a 1979 resolution
opposes ordination.
   Church spokesman Richard Henshaw said Sunday's vote was
confusing.
   ``This may be one of those rare moments when both sides think
they have a victory,'' he said.
   Opponents to the ordination of practicing homosexual priests say
the deputies' amendment reaffirms a 1979 church resolution that
said, ``we believe it is not appropriate for this church to ordain
a practicing homosexual.''
   ``The church is clear on its position that it will not ordain
homosexuals. There is a difference between orientation and
behavior. No one has the right to ordination,'' said Dean James R.
Gundrum of South Dakota.
   But proponents of homosexuals becoming eligible for ordination
say the amendment contradicts the 1979 resolution because it refers
to canon law, not a mere resolution.
   ``As a canon, it would supersede a resolution,'' said the Rt.
Rev. Paul Moore Jr., bishop of New York. ``It says nothing is
barred outside the canons. There's nothing in the canon which bars
homosexuals from being considered.''
   Debate on the deputies' proposal prompted the Rev. David
Collins, president of the House of Deputies, to say, ``All of us
are having a problem understanding what the heck we're doing right
now.''
   The General Convention meets every three years to establish
policy for the church's 2.7 million members.
   The church makes a distinction between homosexual activity,
which it says is sinful, and homosexual orientation, which it says
it not.

<TEXT>
   The man who once declared himself
president for life is now a prisoner in his home, a lonely and
bitter old man whose 30-year grip on this nation is being erased
from the public consciousness.
   Family friends say Habib Bourguiba, who turns 85 on Aug. 3, is
deeply unhappy with his life in the secluded villa where he has
been kept under house arrest since his ouster eight months ago.
   The ailing ex-leader has become virtually a non-person in the
Tunisia of President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali, who was prime
minister when he replaced Bourguiba in a bloodless coup on Nov. 7.
   Tunisian media today rarely refer to the man whose word was law
for more than three decades and whose photograph was once a daily
fixture in the nation's newspapers.
   A multitude of bronze statues of Bourguiba in various poses are
being dismantled without fuss by local authorities throughout this
North African Arab nation.
   The innumerable streets, avenues and institutions that carry his
name are gradually being renamed.
   The dismantling cannot be done too abruptly, the weekly Maghreb
newspaper explained, because ``with all his faults and qualities,
he had become a father to us all, a part of our collective
consciousness.
   ``He was a father, even for his adversaries, for five
generations, a father who fascinated us, who inspired fear and who
oppressed us. We loved him and then hated him. He ruled us by our
own wish and by fear. We cannot obliterate him from our collective
memory, even if we try,'' the newspaper wrote.
   On the day after the coup, newly-named Prime Minister Hedi
Baccouche said Bourguiba would be temporarily confined in the villa
at Mornag, 12 miles southeast of the capital.
   But, Baccouche added, he would be treated with the ``honor and
respect'' due a great leader and the architect of independence from
French colonial rule.
   Bourguiba was removed from office after seven prominent Tunisian
physicians declared him mentally and physically crippled by
senility and unfit to carry out his duties.
   The constitution provided for the automatic succession of the
prime minister, Ben Ali, to the presidency in case of the
president's death or incapacity.
   One of Ben Ali's first acts in office was to change sections of
the constitution that had been tailor-made for Bourguiba and
contained undemocratic provisions _ such as the automatic
succession of the prime minister, a presidential appointee.
   Only a few of Bourguiba's family members are allowed to visit
him in the tree-shaded, single-story Mornag villa. Among them are
his son, former Foreign Minister Habib Bourguiba Jr.
   Other politicians and former aides are strictly barred.
   Bourguiba's niece, Saida Sassi, who played a key backstage role
in the last years of Bourguiba's rule, has turned his care over to
a male nurse and a few servants.
   At the height of her power, Mrs. Sassi was reputed to have been
able to make and unmake ministers at will. She was said to be the
nation's real ruler because of her influence over Bourguiba.
   She lived in the villa for a few weeks after the coup, then
moved to France.
   Sources said Bourguiba deeply resented her departure, which
deprived him of the last companion with whom he liked to talk. The
weekly Tunis-Hebdo newspaper said Mrs. Sassi left because ``the
patriarch kept beating her with his cane.''
   Officials in the Ben Ali government said Bourguiba has firmly
refused to endorse the nation's new leader.
   Few Tunisians now publicly praise Bourguiba's role in the
nation's history, but many older officials of the ruling party are
believed to secretly retain their admiration for him, particularly
in the region of his home town of Monastir in central Tunisia.
   During his 32-year virtual dictatorship, he became the first
leader of any Arab nation to grant equal rights to women, to
condemn the crippling annual fas of the religious festival Ramadan
and to advocate an Arab peace settlement with Israel.
   The government has thus far turned a deaf ear to his request to
be allowed to end his days in Monastir.
   Sources say Bourguiba is particularly embittered because Ben Ali
has not replied to the three letters Bourguiba has written to his
successor since his ouster, one of which asked that he be moved to
Monastir.
   The two men have not met since the coup.
   Because of his weakening eyesight, an employee reads him the
newspaper. The old man watches Tunisian television and Italian
broadcasts from nearby Sicily, but cannot look at the screen for
long periods because of his eyesight.
   The nurse accompanies him on his daily walks in the villa's
two-acre garden. Three successive police checkpoints on the single
approach road keep outsiders away.
   When Bourguiba complained recently that his police guards were
throwing their cigarette butts all over his garden, Ben Ali sent a
team of gardeners to clean up and rejuvenate the entire property.

   William Shatner, whose role as Capt. Kirk
of the starship Enterprise overshadowed his other performances,
says directing the new ``Star Trek'' movie is the most enjoyable
thing he's ever done.
   Shatner said the movie, the fifth on the theme, tentatively is
titled ``The Final Frontier'' and probably will feature the return
of the entire cast of the ``Star Trek'' TV series, including
Leonard Nimoy as Mr. Spock.
   Shatner, speaking Saturday at a Star Trek convention, evaded
most other questions about the film but did say the project has
``gone from a story idea to a full-fledged screenplay.''
   The convention drew ``Trekkies,'' as enthusiasts for the
long-rerunning TV series are known, from around the nation.

   Beach Boy Brian Wilson, who sang of good
vibrations and endless summers before sinking into drug addiction
and isolation, has returned from the deep end with a critically
acclaimed solo album and an optimistic outlook.
   With the help of his controversial psychologist, Eugene Landy,
Wilson kicked the drug habit, dropped his weight from more than 300
pounds to a firm 190, and cut an album that critics put in a league
with the Beach Boys' 1966 classic, ``Pet Sounds.''
   ``This album is better than `Pet Sounds,''' Wilson said in a
recent interview. ``There's no comparison to the two, but this one
has more to offer. It has more to offer the teen-agers, the older
folks and the in-between people.''
   Landy, credited as the new album's executive producer, works
with the 46-year-old Wilson 24 hours a day and considers himself
Wilson's friend, therapist and musical collaborator.
   Landy's tactics have raised charges of ethical violations and
sparked a state investigation into his license. But musically, the
Landy-Wilson relationship has been a healthy one, pop critics say.
   The Los Angeles Times, for example, called the new album,
``Brian Wilson,'' a ``remarkable work that recalls the exhilarating
sweep of the Beach Boys' most endearing recordings.''

   Josie Orr, wife of Gov. Robert D. Orr, is
waging a battle with the Navy to recover a 39-piece silver set
donated by the citizens of Indiana almost a century ago for the
battleship USS Indiana.
   ``It is our silver and the Navy has confiscated it,'' Mrs. Orr
said. ``The Navy didn't pay for it, the state didn't pay for it,
the federal government didn't pay for it. The citizens of Indiana
paid for it.''
   Most of the sterling silver serving set is aboard the USS
Nimitz, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier.
   Four pieces are on display at the governor's Indianapolis
residence, and one large bowl, damaged by a mortar during the
Spanish-American War, is at the Statehouse.
   When the USS Indiana was decommissioned after World War I the
set was transferred to the USS Indianapolis, which was sunk in
1945. Mrs. Orr believes all 39 pieces should be on display in
Indianapolis until the Navy commissions another ship bearing the
state's name.
   She began tracking down the set in 1981 after moving into the
governor's residence.
   ``You wouldn't believe what a struggle it was for two years to
find out who had it. That took me two years of sleuthing. Since we
traced it to the Nimitz, we have started negotiations with the Navy
to retrieve our silver,'' Mrs. Orr said recently.
   Navy officials said there are no plans to return any pieces
permanently.
   The silver was designed by Tiffany and Co. and donated in 1896,
when the battleship USS Indiana was commissioned, according to
Judith L. Lotz, a spokeswoman for the Navy in Washington, D.C.

   Even after 50 years of almost daily
chronicling of life in the metropolis he calls Baghdad by the Bay,
newspaper columnist Herb Caen says it's still a marvelous place to
write about.
   ``Like a snake, (San Francisco) sheds its skins, changes its
shape, wanders off in unexpected directions. A hard city for
sentimentalists, which most writers are,'' Caen wrote in Sunday's
San Francisco Chronicle-Examiner, which devoted its feature section
to recounting his years on the job.
   Caen began writing his column for the Chronicle on July 5, 1938,
at age 22. His journalism is mostly gossip; he mentions an average
of 6,768 names a year.
   ``Remember people's names and they'll never forget you. Forget
and they'll never forgive you,'' he often quotes himself as having
once said.
   Caen's column has given birth to endless phrases and puns that
have worked their wa into everyday language on the West Coast.
   These include the Muniserable Railway, in reference to the
city's transit system; glums, the opposite of gays; the Golden
Great Bridge; Hashbury, for the Haight-Ashbury district that was a
marijuana haven in the 1960s, and Italian Swish Colony, his name
for Finnochio's, a famous nightclub featuring female impersonators.

   Two men claimed victory and a third said he
was leading Sunday in the race to become Mexico's new president.
Opposition party activists staked out vote counting centers and
blocked a major bridge and highways.
   The nation appeared to be in for a long count.
   Results from congressional races began trickling into the
Federal Election Commission late in the day. But as the night wore
on there was no word on the presidential race, which is reported
last.
   The commission has been under fire since it failed to deliver on
its promise of results on election day. It has not explained the
delay.
   The opposition has accused the commission of buying time to cook
the numbers in favor of the governing party. There was also
speculation the party was using the time to deal with at least
partial defeat.
   Meanwhile, as part of the most ambitious vote-monitoring effort
in Mexico's history, opposition supporters staked out the district
committees, waiting to see if the official returns matched tallies
posted earlier by poll workers.
   The governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, claimed
victory for its candidate, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, a few hours
after the polls closed Wednesday.
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, candidate for the leftist National
Democratic Front, claimed victory Saturday based on projections
from his party own count of 6.7 million votes. The country has more
than 38 million registered voters.
   ``We have won the presidential elections,'' he told reporters.
``We will not recognize authorities that might rise out of
electoral fraud.''
   PRI spokesman Juan Enriquez rejected Cardenas' claim Sunday.
   ``Figures we have show that's absolutely wrong,'' he told The
Associated Press. ``It appears that we will be slightly above or
slightly below 50 percent.''
   The third major candidate, Manuel J. Clouthier of the
conservative National Action Party, or PAN, said Saturday that a
count carried out by his supporters showed him ahead.
   Voters in 31 states and the Federal District, which includes
Mexico City, also elected a 500-seat chamber and 64 new senators.
   In Mexico City, crowds gathered at several of the committees
marched and sang the national anthem as city police and soldiers
watched them while guarding the ballots.
   In northern Mexico hundreds of PAN supporters occupied the
Cordoba bridge linking Ciudad Juarez with El Paso, Texas, in one of
several coordinated actions of civil disobedience throughout
northern Chihuahua state.
   The bridge protesters set up tents, listened to radios and
watched a soccer match on portable television sets. They waved PAN
flags and chanted ``Victory! Victory!''
   Traffic stoppages also took place in the cities of Delicias,
Jimenez and Parral, all in Chihuahua state. The protesters demanded
that the election commission respect its party's claims of
victories in three congressional districts now held by the PRI.
   The election commission originally said it would start releasing
returns on Wednesday night. Hours before the polls closed, it said
its computer was broken. It later blamed the delay on bad weather.
   The postponement heightened suspicions in an election already
clouded with accusations of fraud by the opposition and citizen
watchdog groups.
   The PRI-dominated election commission refused to let the Gallup
organization do exit polls that might have given an early clue to
the winner.
   Anything other than total victory in the presidential contest
and the 64 Senate races would be a major reversal for PRI.
   Every PRI presidential candidate since 1929 has been accorded at
least 70 percent of the vote and the only Senate seat the party
ever gave up went to the candidate of an alliance including PRI.
The party has never lost a gubernatorial race and it holds all but
11 of the contested seats in the Chamber of Deputies.
   Salinas, 40, a Harvard-educated economist, was the architect of
President Miguel de la Madrid's austerity plan. De la Madrid's
six-year term ends Dec. 1. Salinas campaigned as the candidate of
the ``progressive center'' and promised to modernize the nation's
stagnant politic and economic institutions.
   Cardenas, 54, is a former Michoacan governor and PRI senator who
left the party when it refused to hold presidential primary
elections. He vowed to take the nation back to the Mexican
Revolution's ideals of economic and social justice.
   Clouthier, is a 54-year-old businessman who advocates more
free-market economic policies.

<HEAD>Study Suggests Partial Privatization Of Social Security</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private study says Social Security should be
placed at least partially in private hands so the federal
government won't be tempted to dip into a surplus expected to reach
$500 billion in 27 years.
   The Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. says such a move would give the
United States a chance to dramatically increase its savings rate.
   The study suggests that workers be allowed to divert 2
percentage points of their payroll tax into individual investment
accounts, similar to Individual Retirement Accounts, starting in
1990, when the tax climbs from 7.51 to 7.65 percentage points.
   In exchange for the private accounts, the workers would
eventually get reduced Social Security benefits.
   The approach would ``ensure that most of the Social Security
reserve is productively invested,'' said the study in the July
issue of Morgan's World Financial Markets report. The report is
published by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., a subsidiary of J.P. Morgan
& Co. Inc.

<HEAD>Oregon And Drugs: `A Great Place to Commit A Crime'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES E. BEGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALEM, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oregon, with its unpopulated timberlands and
crowded prisons, has become a haven for illegal drug production and
drug-related crime.
   ``Oregon is looked at as a great place to commit a crime,'' said
Charles Turner, U.S. attorney for Oregon. ``It's a scandal, an
absolute disgrace.''
   The National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws claims
Oregon now leads the nation in marijuana growing because
authorities have cracked down on growers in Hawaii and California,
previously the two leading states.
   Although some dispute that claim, by most accounts Oregon
produces at least the third-largest marijuana crop in the country,
valued at $600 million.
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration says Oregon now also
ranks third in methamphetamine, or ``speed,'' production, behind
California and Texas.
   Oregon was ranked fifth for serious crimes in 1986, the most
recent year for which figures are available, according to the FBI.
   The state's largest city, Portland, was tied with Chicago in a
recent study for the third-highest rate of drug use among crime
suspects.
   The study, conducted in 10 cities by the National Institute of
Justice, found 75 percent of the suspects in Portland who
volunteered for drug tests after their arrest tested positive for
drug use, a percentage surpassed only by New York and San Diego.
   Word has spread among drug dealers that Oregon has no room in
its jails and prisons, law enforcement officials say. In addition,
Turner said, Oregon had the highest number of inmate escapes in the
nation last year.
   ``If we know that for a five-year felony a person is only going
to serve 42 days, what kind of deterrent is that?'' Turner said.
``If we have a significant drug trafficker, we need to take him out
of circulation.''
   The Legislative Emergency Board this spring approved $5.5
million to expand the state's prison capacity, but it will take
time to implement the plan pushed by Gov. Neil Goldschmidt.
   The chaos in the corrections system, along with Oregon's huge
tracts of undeveloped land, makes the state an ideal spot for
marijuana farming and other illicit ventures, authorities say.
   ``It's easy to hide in those conditions,'' state Attorney
General Dave Frohnmayer said in a recent interview. ``Marijuana and
methamphetamines require privacy and concealment.''
   Turner said federal agencies have few people to patrol the
immense forests.
   ``It just didn't happen; the people let it happen,'' said the
outgoing director of the state DEA office, Connell McGeehan,
accusing Oregonians of having a lax attitude toward drugs.
   If there is a tolerant attitude, some believe it might have
started in 1973. That's when the Legislature made Oregon the first
state to remove criminal penalities for possessing less than an
ounce of marijuana.
   ``It's one of the things that suggested to people to come and
roost here and grow pot,'' Turner said.
   The law ``may have sent a larger message,'' Frohnmayer said. But
he added, ``I'm not sure we want to clog our courts with minor
users.''
   Oregon voters two years ago trounced a measure to legalize
private growing and use of limited amounts of marijuana, but
efforts continue to put a similar proposal on the ballot in
November.
   John Sajo of Portland, leader of the initiative drive, said
police exaggerate drug statistics and might even have caused
increased pot growing. ``There was a promise of riches,'' he said.
``People heard about all this money in it.''

<HEAD>Proxmire Says Democrats Better Off Losing Presidential Race</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Democratic Sen. William Proxmire says his party
might be better off losing the presidential election because of the
severe recession he expects will hit the debt-ridden United States
in the next two years.
   Proxmire, D-Wis., who is retiring after 31 years in the Senate,
said he believes a recession or depression is almost certain by
1990, and so it may be better for Democrats if the Republican
nominee wins the election.
   Otherwise, Democrats might be kissing ``the presidency goodbye
for 40 years,'' he said.
   ``Many of us earnestly believe our country is headed for
economic hell-in-a-handbasket,'' Proxmire was quoted as saying in
The Milwaukee Journal on Sunday.
   ``This senator would give very strong odds that sometime in 1989
or 1990, recession and probably depression will hit,'' Proxmire
said. ``The next president and his party at that time will be in a
political dilemma from which there will be no escape.''
   ``Let us face it. You will not get one in 100 to admit it, but
the best thing that could happen to the Democrats might be to lose
the next presidential election.''

   In remarks to reporters following a speech which emphasized the

   Jesse Jackson's supporters are still trying to
get the Illinois delegation to vote for him as a favorite son on
the first ballot at next week's Democratic convention.
   Leon Finney, who managed Jackson's Illinois campaign, said
Sunday that supporting Jackson as a favorite son would ``unify ...
and bind'' the Illinois delegation at the Atlanta convention.
   ``We're just simply saying that Jesse Jackson has elevated our
state to the point that he is a serious contender for the
presidency of the United States,'' Finney said.
   Illinois Democratic State Chairman Vince Demuzio said he didn't
think Jackson's favorite-son pitch would receive much support.
   ``If Jackson wishes to pursue that that's certainly within his
right to do so,'' Demuzio said. ``I would expect that most of the
delegation will be behind Mike Dukakis.''

   Here's a recipe for a food show: Take a snail
breeder from Petaluma, Calif., a caviar packer from Illinois, a
family of goat farmers from New York State, a ham curer from
Smithfield, Va., and 17 Nebraskans. Add more than 700 other
exhibitors from 21 countries, and stir well.
   The 34th annual International Fancy Food & Confection Show of
the National Association for the Specialty Food Trade opened here
Sunday and runs through Wednesday.
   The Nebraskans didn't have the room-sized booths the
internationally known food producers and distillers rented.
Instead, they shared tables to show the nation's gourmets that
their state belongs on the gastronomic map.
   Lu Clinton, of North Platte, Neb., handed out samples of the 23
flavors of cheesecake her company, Sugar Spoon Inc., distributes in
30 states.
   Delores Lintel, of Lincoln, Neb., promoted the 42 varieties of
wild berry preserves made by Grama's Inc. She placed a dollop of
her chokecherry jelly on a piece of bread for a visitor and watched
him smile at the old-timey taste.
   ``It's our best seller,'' Mrs. Lintel said. ``People buy
memories.''
   They also buy completely new tastes.
   Carolyn Collins of Crystal Lake, Ill., specializes in American
freshwater caviar and smoked Mississippi River sturgeon. And she's
selling something called ``dessert caviar.''
   ``All the salt is removed and it's steeped in passion fruit
liqueur,'' she said. ``You serve it in a bittersweet chocolate
cup.''
   In the booth next to Ms. Collins, Tracy Brash of Petaluma was
serving something more traditional _ snails _ but they were
American-raised snails, the only ones she says are commercially
available from this country.
   ``The U.S. Department of Agriculture classifies me as a rancher,
even though I've only got about 10 acres,'' Brash said. ``I tell
people I've got a big spread with about 35,000 head _ but I've
really got a lot more snails than that.''
   Miles and Lillian Cahn of Pine Plains, N.Y., were among the
proudest exhibitors. A dairy drink they introduced only two months
ago was named one of the best new products of the show. Called
``Yo-Goat,'' it consists of whole goat's milk with yogurt cultures.
   Former leather goods manufacturers, the Cahns sold their New
York City business four years ago and moved up the Hudson River to
raise goats on a 600-acre farm.
   ``Now we have 600 purebred alpine goats,'' said Cahn, 66.
   Another animal, the pig, was featured at the booth of Joyner of
Smithfield, producers of some of the nation's most expensive hams.
   ``There are only four companies left who are legally qualified
to sell their hams as Smithfields,'' said Jim Groves, a spokesman
for the Smithfield, Va., company. ``They have to be cured in a
specific way and aged for at least six months. I think all four
companies together turn out fewer than 150,000 hams a year.
   ``Until recently, all hogs for Smithfield hams had to be
fattened on peanuts alone, but we can't do that economically
anymore,'' said Groves. ``Old-time curers, though, could tell if a
hog was peanut-fattened by feeling the oil on the bone of a hanging
ham or by looking at the color of the fat.''

   Stock prices rallied moderately in Tokyo on Monday,
while the dollar ended trading more than 1 yen higher than last
week's closing level.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 188.95-point winner Friday, finished Monday at
27,985.99 points, up 68.91 points or 0.24 percent.
   After opening at 133.60 yen, the U.S. dollar fell slightly to
finish the day at 133.33 yen, but still up 1.36 yen from Friday's
131.97 yen close. It traded mainly between 133.10-133.65 yen.
   Traders were believed to be reacting to improved economic
indicators in the United States, including the jobless rate, which
fell 0.3 percentage points in June.
   An exchange dealer at another commercial bank said the dollar
rose on a comment by an unidentified U.S. government official
Friday that Washington would tolerate the greenback's rise to about
135 yen.
   The dollar closed at 134.80 yen on Monday last week, its highest
closing since late November.

   A group of young Soviet actors will train with the
Royal Shakespeare Company and British drama students will go to
Moscow in the first such exchange of its kind, the International
Foundation for Training in the Arts announced today.
   The Moscow Art Theater School will send 18 of its drama students
for three weeks' training alongside British actors at London's
Barbican Center in September, the foundation said.
   The visit is the first effort of the newly formed foundation,
set up to encourage such exchanges. Supporters include Vanessa
Redgrave and Peter Ustinov and leading Soviet actor-director, Oleg
Tabakov. Dame Peggy Ashcroft is patron.
   The foundation's executive director is Brian Cox, currently
acting the title role in ``Titus Andronicus'' for the Royal
Shakespeare Company.
   The return British visit will be in April 1989.
   ``We are aiming to bring together the vast untapped pool of
teaching skills of top actors and directors. We also plan to
broaden our activities to include all the performing arts, such as
ballet and opera, and to extend our links with East Germany, Poland
and Japan,'' Cox said.
   He said the Soviet actors will live with British families while
the British actors in Moscow will live in ``dormitories.''

   Teamsters President Jackie Presser, who died
after leading the nation's largest union for five years, is being
remembered both as a great leader and a man who maintained the
Teamsters' reputation for corruption.
   ``Jackie will be remembered for guiding the Teamsters through
difficult and successful contract negotiations during some of the
hardest years for organized labor _ the period of Ronald Reagan's
all-out attack on the trade union movement,'' said Tom Turner,
president of the Metropolitan Detroit AFL-CIO.
   Presser, 61, died late Saturday in a suburban Cleveland hospital
of cardiac arrest after being treated for brain cancer.
   A federal lawsuit filed in New York last month claims the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters is dominated by the Mafia.
Presser was a defendant in the lawsuit.
   The Teamsters leader also was awaiting trial in U.S. District
Court in Cleveland on felony embezzlement and racketeering charges
for allegedly participating in a payroll-padding scheme at
Teamsters Local 507 in Cleveland. ``It was pretty much more of the
same, and the union went downhill,'' Ken Paff, national organizer
for the dissident Teamsters for a Democratic Union, said Sunday of
Presser's tenure.
   ``Presser said many times in public that he made millions of
dollars off the union. He saw it as a business, and he inherited it
from his father. We believe the union is a grass-roots union, that
almost everything good we have in this country comes from unions,''
said Paff, a member of the small but vocal opposition within the
larger 1.6-million member union.
   Because of his health problems, Presser, who was paid about
$800,000 a year, temporarily relinquished his duties in May to
Teamsters secretary-treasurer Weldon Mathis.
   A statement released Sunday by Mathis and the union's executive
board said Presser's death ``will be deeply felt.''
   ``He will long be remembered for his progressive ideas and deep
commitment to the labor movement,'' the statement said. ``He was a
great communicator and spokesman for the needs and concerns of
working people.''
   Presser was an FBI informant, and his attorney, John Climaco,
said Presser participated in the payroll-padding scheme with the
agency's approval.
   In a 1986 report, the White House Commission on Organized Crime
concluded that Presser would not have become Teamsters president
without the help of the head of the New York-based Genovese crime
family, Anthony ``Fat Tony'' Salerno.''
   In May, Salerno was acquitted on charges of rigging the
elections of Presser and Roy Williams, Presser's predecessor.
   Presser, who denied ties with the mob, was known for a sometimes
flamboyant personality. He weighed 350 pounds and once entered a
union convention in Las Vegas while seated in a red chariot guided
by men dressed as Roman soldiers.
   Presser used his influence to win a Teamsters endorsement for
Ronald Reagan in 1980 and was rewarded by being named labor
co-chairman for Reagan's inaugural.
   Presser's last major public appearance was in October 1987, when
he spoke to the AFL-CIO biennial convention. At that meeting, the
Teamsters were welcomed back into the union coalition after 30
years of exile on allegations that the union was influenced by
corrupt forces.
   Despite Presser's death, the government will continue its effort
to take control of the Teamsters, said the prosecutor who brought
the New York suit June 28.
   ``Everybody hoped that (former Teamsters President Jimmy) Hoffa
would clean up for (his predecessor, Dave) Beck,'' U.S. Attorney
Rudolph Giuliani of Manhattan told NBC. ``Everybody hoped that
(Frank) Fitzsimmons would clean up for Hoffa. Everybody hoped that
Williams would clean up for Fitzsimmons. And everybody hoped that
Presser would clean up for Williams.
   ``So you can always hope, but from the point of view of fairly
and effectively enforcing the law, you can't depend on hope,'' he
said.
   Beck was convicted of embezzlement, Hoffa of obstructing justice
and mail fraud and Williams of trying to bribe a senator.
Fitzsimmons was investigated but never indicted and died in office
in 1981.
   Presser, the son of Teamsters organizer William ``Big Bill''
Presser, ascended to the Teamsters presidency in 1983 after
Williams' conviction.
   Presser's funeral is scheduled for Tuesday in Cleveland Heights.
   Presser is survived by his fifth wife, Cynthia; his son, Gary;
his daughter, Bari Lynn; and his mother, Faye.

<TEXT>
   At least 2,000 people gathered at the
swept-clean site of a collapsed department store to mourn the 14
dead and hear the disaster and rescue described as ``our finest
hour as well as our greatest tragedy.''
   ``The disaster is now over. The rubble is cleared away. The
victims are taken care of and now we are expected to return to life
as usual,'' Rabbi Arthur Rutberg said Sunday, a day after the last
of the bodies was recovered.
   The three-story Amigo Store collapsed Thursday during a
torrential rain that prompted numerous passersby to duck inside for
cover.
   Fourteen people were killed and six were pulled alive from the
rubble. At least 47 people were injured. Dozens crawled to safety.
   The disaster drew hundreds of volunteers from thoughout the Rio
Grande Valley, many of of whom worked with little rest for three
days straight, searching for the living and the dead.
   ``The greatest lesson of this disaster is that Brownsville,
Texas, is a great community that can work together as one unified
and cooperative entity,'' Rutberg told victims' relatives, friends
and others.
   ``Our lives and our community can never be the same again not
only for those who suffered great losses, but (for) all of us. This
has been our finest hour as well as our greatest tragedy.''
   The service was intended as an emotional release for the
community, said the Rev. Tom Pincelli, another speaker.
   ``I don't think we can just walk away. We want to give a
psychological conclusion to what transpired,'' he said.
   Those at the ceremony included 8-year-old Denise Carerra, who
was pulled from the rubble virtually unscathed while her mother and
4-year-old brother perished, and Bernard Levin, the store owner,
who did not speak or make himself available to reporters.
   Denise's aunt, Guillermina Silva de Carerra, thanked the crowd
tearfully. ``I wish I knew everyone's names so that we knew who to
thank by name. Thank you ... we felt the spiritual and moral
support.''
   A Brownsville woman at the service said she had watched the
rescuers after the accident. ``Inside I feel sad,'' said Martha
Mancilla Meyers. ``Nothing like this has ever happened in
Brownsville before.''
   Officials have said the weight of an estimated 2 inches of
rainfall from a 45-minute downpour may have caused the flat roof to
give way. Others speculated that the roof's drainage holes were
clogged.
   Investigators began examining debris placed in the border city's
dump. Representatives from every agency that participated in the
rescue were to gather this week to review the accident and rescue
efforts, said Mayor Ygnacio Garza.
   A team from the Southern Building Codes Congress International,
based in Birmingham, Ala., arrived to assist in the investigation.
   Glenn Winslow, an investigator for the organization, said that
because the building was destroyed and much of its debris hauled
away, a thorough investigation may be impossible.
   A damage assessment team of officials from the Department of
Housing and Urban Development and the Federal Emergency Management
Agency also was in Brownsville to determine whether the city is
eligible for disaster assistance.
   Meanwhile, Charter Palms Hospital, a mental health center,
offered free counseling to everyone involved, including onlookers.
   The mayor said city officials are considering building a
memorial plaza on the department store site.
   ``It's now time to bring this chapter to an end. A little more
than three days ago I stood in the street in front of a collapsed
building and declared a state of emergency for the city of
Brownsville,'' Garza said.
   ``Tonight I stand here on this spot with all of us and all of
you to state that this emergency is now over. Let us go and pray.
Let us go in peace. Let us go forth.''

<HEAD>Sihanouk, In Unexplained Move, Resigns From Resistance Coalition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince Norodom Sihanouk said today he
has resigned as head of the Cambodian resistance coalition,
surprising the United States and other countries that hoped he
would play a key role in Cambodian peace talks.
   ``For serious reasons that are, for the moment, impossible for
me to enumerate and to explain, please allow me today to resign as
president of Democratic Kampuchea (Cambodia),'' Sihanouk said in a
statement issued by his office here.
   ``I have decided to go into exile in France,'' he said, thanking
Thailand and China, which have given him and his family refuge.
   All through the previous week, Sihanouk had seemed about to take
center stage in impending peace talks on Cambodia. Last week, he
met in Bangkok with Secretary of State George P. Shultz, Japanese
Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno and other Asian leaders attending a
regional meeting.
   Sihanouk, a former Cambodian head of state, had led a
three-party guerrilla coalition fighting Vietnamese troops that
invaded Cambodia in late 1978. The mercurial prince has previously
quit as president, then changed his mind, making such shifts a part
of his traditional diplomacy.
   Vietnam has said it will withdraw all of its troops from
Camobodia by 1990.
   Shultz, speaking to reporters in Jakarta, Indonesia, said he
didn't know how to interpret reports Sihanouk has resigned, adding
that in recent meetings the prince seemed to take a
``constructive'' approach to the Cambodian problem.
   ``He has every intention of seeing this through,'' Shultz said
of the Cambodian leader, who has in the past ``resigned'' from
various positions only to re-accept them later.
   In Tokyo, a Foreign Ministry official called Sihanouk's
statement a surprise and said the ministry is trying to determine
the prince's intentions.
   ``We hope Sihanouk continues in his role as a leader to the
Cambodian problem,'' the Japanese official added, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   A spokesman in Sihanouk's office said he wasn't sure if the
prince would be carrying out his previous pledge to attend peace
talks planned for July 25 in Indonesia.
   Sihanouk was to leave Bangkok for France later today, the
spokesman said.
   In Jakarta, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said today
that Sihanouk sent a letter to the Indonesian government
apologizing for cancelling a visit that was to begin today, but
saying without elaboration that he would go to Jakarta in late July.
   Sihanouk also said he regretted he was cancelling visits to the
countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN,
and to Japan.
   The resistance coalition also includes the Communist Khmer
Rouge, which brutalized Cambodia before the Vietnamese invasion,
and the Khmer People's National Liberation Front led by former
premier Son Sann.
   Sihanouk said in his statement that his son, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, would represent him in the coalition.
   The talks were to involve the three guerrilla factions, the
Vietnamese-installed government in Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos and
ASEAN members.
   ASEAN foreign ministers and their Western allies declared during
annual talks last week in Bangkok that Sihanouk should play a
central role in the talks and a future Cambodian government.
   They strongly endorsed Sihanouk's proposals that a coalition
government comprising all the Cambodian factions be formed to
supervise elections after a Vietnamese withdrawal and an
international peacekeeping force be set up to prevent the
Vietnamese or the Khmer Rouge from retaking power.
   In May 1987, Sihanouk began a year's ``leave of absence'' as
president of the coalition. He later said he wanted to gain more
flexibility in pursuing talks with Hun Sen, prime minister of the
Vietnam-installed government in Cambodia.
   Those talks, held in France in December and January, failed to
produce any breakthroughs. Sihanouk then canceled a scheduled third
round of talks.

   A senior government official says an
agreement has been signed in Pakistan on the repatriation of about
250,000 Pakistanis who were stranded in Bangladesh when it gained
independence.
   Foreign Secretary Nazrul Islam told a news conference the
agreement was signed Saturday in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital,
between the government of Pakistan and Rabita, a humanitarian group
based in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.
   Islam said officials in Dhaka were ``happy'' over the agreement.
   According to the agreement, Rabita will raise nearly $500
million for the repatriation and rehabilitation of 250,000
Pakistanis stranded in Bangladesh since December 1971, when
Bangladesh, then East Pakistan, became an independent country after
a liberation struggle and a war between India and Pakistan.
   By 1973, 174,000 refugees had returned to Pakistan, but the
repatriation ended abruptly when funds ran out, stranding about
250,000 people who remain in refugee camps in Bangladesh.

   Two conservative Persian Gulf Arab states
have made new ties with the communist world: Qatar established
diplomatic relations with China and Kuwait announced a new arms
deal with the Soviet Union.
   Kuwaiti Defense Minister Sheik Nawaf Al-Ahmed signed an
agreement with the Soviet deputy minister of foreign trade and
economic relations, Gen. Yuri Grishin, that ``provides for
supplying Kuwait with certain military equipment,'' an official
announcement in Kuwait on Sunday.
   Neither Kuwaiti officials nor the Soviet Embassy would provide
details of the accord. The Kuwaiti announcement did not say when
the accord was signed.
   The Qatar government announced Sunday that it was establishing
relations with China, leaving Saudi Arabia and Bahrain the only two
Arab states with which China lacks diplomatic ties.
   The announcements were made by Kuwaiti and Qatari news agencies
and radio, monitored in Bahrain.
   The People's Daily newspaper in Beijing said Sunday that Qatar's
ambassador to France, Abdul Rahman Al-Attiyah, and his Chinese
counterpart, Zhou Jue, signed a document establishing relations
Tuesday in France.
   China has a history of good relations with the front-line Arab
states _ Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon _ and the Palestine
Liberation Organization has a permanent mission in Beijing. China
does not recognize Israel.
   However, the pro-Western Arab states of the Gulf Cooperation
Council have moved slowly to recognize Communist China.
   China established ties in 1971 with Kuwait, in 1978 with Oman
and in 1984 with the United Arab Emirates. Qatar, Saudi Arabia and
Bahrain are the three other gulf council states.
   Despite the absence of relations between Saudi Arabia, which
harbors Islam's holiest shrines, and the communist countries, the
Saudi government recently purchased Chinese-made CSS-2
surface-to-surface missiles from Beijing.
   Kuwait had also signed a $325 million arms deal with the Soviets
in 1985, involving surface-to-air missiles.
   It purchased the SAM-7 projectiles after the Congress blocked
its bid to buy American Stinger missiles, complicating Kuwait's
plan to boost its defenses against the spillovers of the 8-year-old
Iran-Iraq war.
   The Qatari and Kuwaiti announcements came as Kuwaiti Crown
Prince Sheik Saad al-Abdullah Al-Sabah flew to Washington on an
official visit.
   Sheik Saad, who also is prime minister, is the first such
ranking Kuwaiti leader to visit the United States since 1968.
   During his stay, he was expected to try to conclude a $1.9
million deal involving the purchase of 40 F-A-18 fighter-bombers
and Maverick anti-ship and anti-tank missiles.

   The rains finally came to parts of the drought-stricken South
and Midwest, bringing jubilation to some and despair to others who
had hoped for too much.
   Thunderstorms in North Carolina and Michigan on Sunday brought
damaging high winds and led to injuries, including six people hit
by lightning in Michigan and a North Carolina woman who was
hospitalized after a power surge went through her electric curling
iron.
   But in Wisconsin, crop rejuvenation came almost overnight.
   ``It (the corn) looks nice and green right now, it's unfolded.
It's probably grown two inches since this morning,'' Wisconsin
farmer Vince Garvoille said Sunday while examining three-quarters
of an inch in his rain gauge. He said his hay probably grew three
inches in the 10 hours after the weekend rain.
   ``It just popped out of the ground,'' Garvoille said. ``It's
amazing what water can do.''
   In Kentucky and Illinois there remained mostly only promises.
Georgia was still hot and dry, with a half inch of rain only in one
area.
   In Iowa, rain in some areas reached five inches.
   A cold front pushed thunderstorms into southern Illinois today.
The National Weather Service predicted scattered thundershowers
through Tuesday, but the amount of rainfall was expected to be less
than half an inch.
   ``Illinois needs more rain than you can imagine to end the
drought,'' said Carl Williams, of the Chicago weather service
office.
   Williams said a ``whiz-bang'' thunderstorm dropped only a trace
of rain at O'Hare International Airport Sunday afternoon, with a
little more falling on downtown Chicago.
   ``It wasn't enough to settle the dust but it was better than
nothing,'' he said.
   Storms moved out of Iowa on Sunday night, but the weather
service said showers and thunderstorms were possible tonight
through Wednesday in parts of the state.
   Five inches of rain fell in parts of Iowa, while other areas got
less than a half-inch from storms late Friday through the weekend,
``still leaving the crops in a tenuous situation,'' said S. Elwynn
Taylor, a climatologist at Iowa State University.
   ``The state as a whole requires four inches of precipitation to
break the drought,'' he said.
   At Logan, Iowa, farmer Ivan Leonard said he got a little more
than five inches over two days.
   ``This is going to be a big boost to the bean crop,'' he said,
adding that it will help salvage some of his corn crop as well.
   A blanket of stagnant air scattered thunderstorms and lightning
across North Carolina, and heavy rains caused some flooding.
   A 20-year-old Transylvania County woman was injured Sunday when
lightning apparently struck her house and power surged through a
curling iron she was using.
   The woman, who was not identified by Transylvania County
Hospital personnel, was in satisfactory condition this morning
suffering from electrical shock, they said.
   The high winds felled trees, knocking out power to about 2,500
customers in the county.
   Areas of Michigan got up to an inch of rain, but with it came
high winds and lightning that injured at least six and cut power to
31,000 residents, officials said.
   But for most of Michigan, the rain brought relief.
   ``When it started downpouring, I was smiling. I was whistling,''
said John Nink, 29, who measured a half inch of rain in his
Traverse City cherry orchard.
   Storms dumped up to 1{ inches of rain on Ohio, but it was far
short of what weather officials say is needed to end the drought.
   Hot, dry weather continued across Georgia except in Valdosta,
which reported more than a half inch of rain Sunday.
   Despite the drought, the Georgia Department of Agriculture
reported that the Georgia peach harvest could be the best in four
years because of irrigation.
   A cold front that has the potential for triggering showers was
headed for Kentucky, but can't be counted on for major drought
relief.
   ``The system is still coming down this way,'' said Marilyn
Scholz, of the weather service in Louisville. ``As far as how much
rain, that's a good question. It still probably won't be as much as
we need.''
   Weekend rainfall of up to a three-quarters of an inch dropped on
parts of Kentucky.
   In Georgia, where 2,500 Army National Guardsmen are getting
ready for two weeks of training, officials said they will take
special precautions at drought-parched Fort Stewart.
   Sgt. 1st Class Jerry Allen, 39, of Cedartown, Ga., said the base
is the driest it's been in the 14 years he's attended summer camp.
   ``It's going to be dusty and it's going to be dangerous,'' said
Allen, an M-1 tank crewman. ``All it takes is one flare or one
spark to set the woods on fire.''

<HEAD>Disappointing Rain in Drought-Battered Midwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   Showers and thunderstorms packing winds up to 58 mph covered
sections of the Northeast, the Midwest and the Southwest today
after disappointingly small rains fell in the drought-battered
Midwest.
   A flash flood watch was in effect for much of west Texas, where
rain was very heavy in some places. Nearly an inch of rain fell in
just one hour near Pandale in southwest Texas.
   Showers and thunderstorms also fell in southern Arizona, eastern
Ohio, western Pennsylvania, northern Nebraska and parts of
Missouri. At Cleveland's Lakefront Airport, winds gusted to 58 mph.
   The storms Sunday in parts of the Midwest left less than a
quarter of an inch of rain in most of Illinois, Indiana and lower
Michigan. Chicago received only a trace of rain.
   A few farmers got a break. An inch of rain fell at Sheridan,
Ind., and more than an inch fell at Alpena, Mich.
   Showers and thunderstorms dissipated late Sunday over Florida,
the Gulf Coast states, the Carolinas, the Tennessee Valley and the
Rockies.
   In Michigan, a gust from a severe thunderstorm Sunday collapsed
Dome World, an indoor softball and golf driving range complex in
Grand Rapids. In Belding, where the Gus Macker Basketball
Tournament was being played, one person was injured by lightning
and another was hurt by falling tree limbs. All the backboards,
each weighing 1,200 pounds, were knocked down.
   Two people were struck by lightning in Bay County, Mich., while
trying to cover a boat, authorities said.
   In High Point, N.C., a severe thunderstorm knocked over a
two-story cinder-block wall of a building under construction, and
blew a roof off a K mart being built down the road. The roof landed
on cars in an adjacent parking lot.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
East Coast to the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, the Gulf Coast states
and the southern Plains, with showers and thunderstorms most
numerous over northern New England and the upper Ohio Valley;
widely scattered showers and thunderstorms over the Rockies; and
showers in the Pacific Northwest.
   High temperatures were forecast for the 70s in the upper Great
Lakes region, the upper Mississippi Valley and the northern Plains;
the 60s and 70s in the Pacific Northwest and along the California
coast; more than 100 degrees in the desert Southwest and
California's central valleys; unseasonably high temperatures in the
mid- to upper 90s in the middle and north Atlantic Coast states;
and 80s and and 90s elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 46
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 94 degrees at Nellis
Air Force Base in Nevada.

   A minister facing trial Wednesday on
federal charges of transporting and harboring illegal aliens was
selling Salvadoran babies, prosecutors allege.
   But the case of the Lutheran minister, and a free-lance
journalist indicted with him, has been embraced by the sanctuary
movement of clergy and lay people who have been aiding refugees
from Central America since the early 1980s.
   The Rev. Glen Remer-Thamert, 44, and Demetria Martinez, 27, were
indicted Dec. 10, accused of helping two pregnant Salvadoran women
enter the United States illegally in August 1986. Both women gave
birth in the United States, and one of the babies was put up for
adoption.
   U.S. Attorney William Lutz, who will prosecute the case, charged
in a court document filed in February that Remer-Thamert was
selling Salvadoran babies for adoption, not helping political
refugees.
   ``As soon as the defendant got his hands on the babies, he meant
to transport the women back to El Salvador,'' the document said.
   Remer-Thamert was indicted on nine counts, including conspiracy,
transporting and harboring illegal aliens and mail fraud. Ms.
Martinez was charged with four counts of transporting and inducing
illegal aliens.
   ``For us, it is not something that is against the law, to give
sanctuary to someone fleeing for his or her life,'' said Patricio
Guerrerortiz, a member of the New Mexico Sanctuary Defense
Committee, which was set up to help pay the defendants' legal
expenses.
   Remer-Thamert has said he is being prosecuted because of his
outspoken criticism of the Reagan administration's policies in
Central America.
   Ms. Martinez, a free-lance writer who covers religion for the
Albuquerque Journal and the National Catholic Reporter, says she
acted solely as a journalist when she accompanied Remer-Thamert and
tried to take steps to ensure she would not so much as travel with
the women to Albuquerque.
   ``I have researched a number of topics that pertain to religion,
including the sanctuary movement and the role of mainline
denominations relative to that movement,'' she said at the time of
her indictment.
   She also has said she never wrote a story about the women,
partly out of fear for their safety.
   The indictment accused Remer-Thamert of submitting false expense
documents to Rainbow House International, an adoption agency, and
of receiving $2,900.
   Remer-Thamert said after his indictment that he was reimbursed
for some costs of helping the women but received no fees.
   The women, Cecelia Elias-Alegria and Inez Campos-Anzora, remain
in the United States and are expected to be called as prosecution
witnesses.
   Sanctuary supporters were elated last month when U.S. District
Judge John Conway ruled that a March 28, 1986, proclamation by
former Gov. Toney Anaya declaring New Mexico a sanctuary state
could be used by Remer-Thamert and Ms. Martinez in their defense.
Conway will hear the case.
   The proclamation was rescinded by Gov. Garrey Carruthers when he
took office in January 1987.
   Remer-Thamert said last week he was dismissed from his social
services job with the state after the indictment. Since then, he
said, he has been taking care of his two children, writing a book
and raising a garden.
   A Salvadoran attorney, Luis Arturo Ventura-Rivas, also was named
in the indictment but he will not be tried because he remains in El
Salvador.

<HEAD>U.S. Air Base Issue Looms Over Shultz, Aquino Talk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino said today
she does not expect her talks with Secretary of State George P.
Shultz to solve an impasse over the presence of U.S. military bases
in the Philippines.
   Shultz said, meanwhile, that Washington has found ``other
options'' if the United States is forced to abandon its largest
military operation in Asia.
   ``The presence of the United States in this region is a
significant factor, it's part of the strategic equation,'' Shultz
told a news conference today.
   ``The idea of the United States not being here is virtually
unthinkable for people,'' he said in Jakarta, Indonesia, today
before leaving for Manila.
   The future of seven U.S. military facilities is expected to be a
major issue in talks with Mrs. Aquino and other leaders. Street
demonstrators and some politicians have called for their removal
even before a bases treaty expires in 1991.
   The Manila stop is part of a nine-nation Asian and Pacific tour
for Shultz.
   Neither the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, nor most of
its six members have publicly voiced support for continued U.S.
military presence in the Philippines. But Shultz said talks with
Japan, Australia and most association members have shown they are
against their removal.
   ``Our military people have had to think about how they are going
to carry out their mission and somewhat to their surprise they
found ... ways of doing it,'' Shultz said. He declined to specify
the options.
   Negotiations between the two countries began in April and were
to have concluded last week. But they have been stalled on the
question of U.S. compensation to the Philippines and proposed curbs
on U.S. military operations at the facilies, sources close to the
talks said.
   Mrs. Aquino indicated in a brief interview with Filipino
reporters at the presidential palace today that she may not bring
up the subject of the bases when she meets with Shultz on Tuesday.
   Reporters asked Mrs. Aquino if she expected her talks with
Shultz to lead to an agreement on compensation to the Philippines
for continued use of Clark Air Base, Subic Naval Base and four
smaller facilities.
   ``No,'' said Mrs. Aquino, ``because the review is still going
on, and it will be up to the review committee to discuss that.
Shultz is not part of the review panel. It is (U.S. Ambassador
Nicholas) Platt and on and on our side, (Foreign Secretary Raul)
Manglapus.''
   The United States currently gives the Philippines $180 million
in economic and military aid annually in exchange for use of the
bases. Manglapus said when the talks began that $1.2 billion a year
was a more ``realistic figure.''
   Sources close to the talks say that the United States is
unwilling to substantially increase current compensation levels
without guarantees from the Manila government that it will extend
the lease on the bases when it expires in 1991.
   In addition, the Senate also has passed a bill that seeks to ban
nuclear weapons or passage through the country of nuclear-armed and
nuclear-powered ships. The bill has not been debated by the more
conservative House of Represenatives.
   Shultz said last month that the United States would scuttle its
military bases in the Philippines and terminate its security
relationship with its former colony if such a bill were enacted.

   A man who says he runs an agency that
helps find abducted children and pledged to use ``guerrilla
tactics'' to return youngsters to their parents has been charged
with attempted abduction and sexual abuse of young boys.
   David Robert Riggs, 37, is being held in the Wood County jail in
lieu of $25,000 bond. He was arrested July 2 by Wood County
sheriff's deputies after a woman in nearby Boaz said he tried to
abduct her 13-year-old grandson.
   Riggs was charged with two felony counts of attempted abduction
and a misdemeanor count of third-degree sexual abuse.
   Riggs represents himself as director of Search Seven New York,
which purportedly does ``aggressive investigations designed to
recover criminally abducted children.''
   In all, six boys in Mason and Wood counties accused Riggs of
propositioning them for photographs July 1 and July 2. He allegedly
offered the boys $5 to pose for photographs on the spot, and more
if they would get in his car and pose in a remote area wearing
bikini underwear he would provide.
   Three boys agreed to pose on the spot but none got into Riggs'
car. The attempted abduction charges stem from his request that
they enter the car; the third-degree sex abuse charge was brought
because one of the boys said Riggs pulled down the boy's swim
trunks and touched his genitals.
   Last week, police searched Riggs' dusty 1973 Oldsmobile Omega,
but police found no exposed film. The one roll in a camera was
loaded incorrectly and contained no photographs.
   Wood County Sheriff Steve Greiner said he hopes to keep Riggs in
custody while investigators continue to study his past.
   So far, authorities here said they have no evidence Riggs has
ever been charged with sexual abuse anywhere else. But Greiner said
they also have found no record that Riggs ever helped locate lost
children in the four years that he has dogged police departments, a
national missing-children center and the parents of abducted
children for information.
   Police said Riggs, a New Yorker who recently moved to the
central Michigan town of Crystal, alternatively represents himself
as a private investigator, the head of a non-profit agency and a
university sociologist.
   His queries prompted the FBI in Pennsylvania and state police in
Illinois to investigate him, officials said. Police in Tennessee
said they closed the door on Riggs when he gave different stories
of who he was.
   The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children _ which
does not work with private investigators _ turned Riggs away when
he was unable to verify who he was or why he wanted detailed
records on every missing child in the United States.
   In June 1987, the center warned parents of missing children
that, despite his claims otherwise, Riggs was not working with the
agency.
   ``No information has been released to him, nor will it be,''
according to the center's deputy director John Rabun.
   ``We said, `OK, David, fine. What are you?''' Rabun said.
``First, he said he was a not-for-profit agency, then he said he
was a private investigator. Later he said he was working for
Columbia University.''
   Rabun said a background check turned up no New York records of a
private investigator's license for Riggs or a tax number for Search
Seven.
   In 1984, Riggs described himself to an Allentown, Pa., newspaper
reporter as a schoolteacher turned salesman who started searching
for missing children because he was outraged by the abductions.
   ``I plan to use `guerrilla tactics' police don't usually use,''
Riggs was quoted as saying. ``This is a battle. This isn't
something you can sit back in your armchair and contemplate your
next attack.''

   Beset by a weak economy but boosted by
Utah's Republican leanings, Gov. Norm Bangerter hopes to salvage
his sagging re-election campaign with an aggressive attack on his
Democratic challenger.
   But some Republican die-hards say it may be too late.
   Bangerter, who trails Democrat Ted Wilson in polls, says he will
spend the dog days of summer in rural Utah and other traditional
GOP strongholds trying to persuade Republicans that Utah has moved
forward under his hand despite a stagnant economy and a record tax
increase.
   ``My biggest challenge and concern is that people are going to
base this decision on emotion rather than facts, and that would be
the biggest mistake,'' Bangerter said in an interview.
   Other Republicans say Bangerter still can win, but they caution
that even in this predominantly Republican state a victory over
Wilson will not come easily.
   ``I believe it's winnable, but the governor has got to get his
case to the people, his record and what he's done. It's a good
case, but we may have passed the point in time where we could
salvage the election,'' said former Republican State Chairman
Charles Akerlow, who presided over the GOP's sweep of major offices
in 1984.
   Bangerter's popularity plummeted after he cajoled the
Legislature last year into passing a $166 million tax increase, the
largest in Utah history.
   His problems have been deepened by the state's weak economy, the
failure of five Utah thrift and loan institutions and dry weather
that made a mockery of his decision several years ago to spend $60
million to install pumps to remove floodwaters from the Great Salt
Lake _ the lake level has since gone down largely on its own.
   Recent initiatives have done little to restore public
confidence. Even his announcement last month of a plan to rebate
$80 million in surplus income taxes and lower rates by 5 percent
failed to revive his candidacy.
   A Deseret News-KSL-TV poll taken in early July and released last
Tuesday found he had the support of 28 percent of the 603 residents
surveyed, compared with 51 percent for Wilson, the former mayor of
Salt Lake City.
   Bangerter lost 2 percentage points of support while Wilson
climbed by the same amount since a similar poll in June. But Dave
Buhler, Bangerter's campaign manager, dismissed the changes as
statistically irrelevant since the poll's margin of error was 4
percentage points.
   A further complication for Bangerter is the independent campaign
of former Republican Merrill Cook. Cook entered the race at the
behest of the Tax Limitation Coalition of Utah, which is sponsoring
three tax-reduction initiatives that have qualified for the
November ballot.
   The latest Deseret News-KSL-TV poll found Cook had the support
of 13 percent of those surveyed, evenly divided among those who
otherwise would vote for Bangerter and Wilson. But Wilson can
afford the loss; Bangerter cannot.
   Bangerter contends that the state's Republican majority will
vote for him once it realizes that, despite the tax increase, he
has made sound decisions. For instance, he said he will emphasize
that during his term the state budget has dropped 8 percent and
unemployment has fallen to 5 percent, the lowest rate of the 1980s.
   ``If the voters want strong, conservative fiscal government,
responsible government, my record provides that,'' Bangerter said.
``I don't think Wilson provides that. He provides a record of
taxing and spending. I have a record of taxing, but not spending.''
   Wilson said his task is to keep Bangerter on the defensive.
   ``I predict my lead will narrow,'' Wilson said. ``I need to get
my story out, and I'm not going to let them take the agenda away
from me. Let's face it, the state is 2-1 Republican.''
   Bangerter appears to have a slight lead in fund-raising. Buhler
said the governor has spent about $350,000 and has $50,000 to
$70,000 in the bank.
   Rob Jolley, Wilson's campaign manager, said the former mayor has
raised about $365,000 and spent $350,000. The largest single
expenditure was $170,000 for a television advertising campaign that
was designed to solidify Wilson's support. Jolley said the ads
apparently did more than expected.
   ``We didn't feel it would bring us a lot of new support. We were
surprised that we gained,'' he said.

   Horse track announcer Ed Grimsley kept
fans at Scioto Downs wondering as they awaited his word on a
decision _ one that would have a much bigger impact than the
outcome of a disputed race.
   Most of the 5,121 harness racing fans in attendance Friday night
gave a big cheer when Grimsley ended the suspense just before the
11th race. He said he would marry Becki Manning, then dropped into
his cadence of calling the race.
   Ms. Manning had used the track's message board to propose to
Grimsley after the eighth race. ``To Ed G., Will You Marry Me?
Becki M.,'' her message read.
   Grimsley got plenty of good-natured advice for and against
marriage from the crowd after the proposal was made, and he took
his time answering. After the ninth race, message board operator
Rob Reed posted an anxious request for Grimsley's response.
``What's The Answer, Ed?'' it said.
   Then came a race won by a horse named Never My Love. ``One of
the judges asked me if the winner of the 10th race was my answer,''
Grimsley said.
   But as the horses approached the start of the 11th race,
Grimsley said over the public address system, ``And the answer to
Becki M. is yes.''
   ``I figured he'd come back with something funny on the message
board,'' Ms. Manning said. ``I was shocked when he said yes, and I
couldn't believe he just went on with the race without missing a
beat.''
   ``I really did it as a joke,'' she added. ``I told him that some
day I was going to ask him to marry me on the message board, It was
sort of a dare.''
   ``It wasn't the first time she had asked,'' Grimsley said. ``I
didn't think I was the marrying type, but I guess I am now.''
   Ms. Manning, 35, and Grimsley, 29, have been dating for two
years. Both are from Sabina in west-central Ohio.

   About 60 nudists took their
seventh annual canoeing trip on the Delaware River without a hitch
_ and without any sunburns, a spokesman says.
   ``We certainly used a lot of sunburn lotion today,'' said
Michael Gesner, the 42-year-old head of two nudists groups with
membership in New Jersey and surrounding states.
   Gesner and members of the Tri-State Sun Club and Tri-State Metro
Naturist Inc. gathered Sunday for a six-hour trip with 31 canoes at
the Delaware Water Gap National Recreational Area for what they
called ``canuding'' as part of National Nude Weekend.
   Gesner says park-goers could not see the nudists' bottom halves
because the canoes blocked them from view.
   ``We just had a good time,'' Gesner said. ``It's not a big deal
any more.''
   He says nudists prefer to go without clothes because it makes
more sense on days like Sunday, when temperatures reached into the
90s.
   ``It's just a practical thing,'' he said.

   A 10-foot-long, 300-pound alligator,
apparently seeking relief from the drought, has set up house in one
of catfish farmer Sherman Yates' ponds.
   Yates isn't too happy about it, but he's not brave enough to ask
his guest to leave.
   ``When we were feeding the catfish at noon Saturday, I saw the
alligator with a whole mouthful of my fish,'' said Yates, who farms
200 acres of ponds 22 miles south of Greenville. ``I've heard of
being generous, but let's not get ridiculous.''
   Yates' ponds are next to the Yazoo National Wildlife Refuge and
the farmer said the alligator apparently came from the refuge
seeking food and water. Refuge officials said ponds in the park are
low because of the drought.
   The refuge's game warden has promised to ask state marine
biologists to remove the alligator, Yates said.
   The unwanted guest has caused harvesting to stop in the pond it
is occupying, the farmer said.
   ``The number of fish he has eaten hasn't gotten me too upset, as
long as they get him out,'' Yates said.
   About 70,000 fish are harvested yearly from the five-foot deep,
350-by-150 yard pond, Yates said.

   Eight skydivers dropped in on a secluded
north Georgia resort wearing nothing but their parachutes, but
then, the several hundred people watching from below didn't have
any clothes on either.
   The nude skydiving Sunday capped a day of events at The Hidden
Valley Nudist Resort, where about 800 guests gathered in honor of
National Nude Weekend. They had several pastimes to choose from
over the weekend _ including sunbathing, camping, swimming and
volleyball _ but the skydiving demonstration was the high point of
the day.
   ``It's the first time someone has skydived nude in Georgia,''
said Evan Bell, a 61-year-old guest relations employee at the
resort.
   Eight men jumped from a plane flying at 3,500 feet, wearing only
their parachutes, and successfully landed in a field at the resort.
   One of the skydivers, Steve Smith, 38, of Fairburn, said, ``I
like the freedom of being nude. I just take my clothes off and we
go from there.''

   ``As much as I like Maxwell's, it's an awful lot of work to keep

   The restaurant's 155 employees were told Sunday afternoon of the

   Maxwell's failing fortunes in the highly competitive Manhattan

hired four chefs with drastically different styles in an effort to
turn the restaurant around.
   Maxwell's Plum, located on the Upper East Side, opened in April

   The government today said Carlos Salinas de
Gortari had a wide lead over his opponents but that election
results still were not final five days after voters cast ballots
for a new president.
   The partial results were released after opposition activists
blocked highways and closed international bridges to press the
government to release the results of the general elections.
   Earlier, one opposition candidate had claimed victory and a
third said he was leading.
   Charges of ballot-box fraud and the Federal Election
Commission's failure to release results clouded what was expected
to be an easy victory for governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party and Salinas, the party's presidential candidate.
   The government said Salinas received 52.89 percent of the votes
counted so far, the Federal Electoral Commission said. Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas of the leftist National Democratic Front trailed with
29.10 percent of the vote, the electoral commission said, and
National Action Party candidate Manuel Clouthier was third with
16.68 percent.
   Mexico has 38 million registered voters. The government said it
has counted about 13.24 million votes, but did not say how many
ballots were cast.
   Protesters who blockaded two bridges across the Rio Grande in
Chihuahua state went home early today after the election commission
released results that showed the National Action Party won three
congressional races in the Juarez area.
   But uncertainty clouded the presidential race.
   The Institutional Revolutionary Party declared Salinas the
winner hours after the polls closed Wednesday.
   Cardenas claimed late Saturday that he had won.
   And Manuel Clouthier of the National Action Party said his
party's figures showed he was ahead in the presidential balloting.
   The governing party leaked early returns on Friday in an attempt
to stifle speculation it had suffered a devastating loss. The
figures gave Salinas 47.4 percent of the 4.5 million votes
tabulated at that point, Cardenas 26.7 percent and Clouthier 20.7
percent.
   The electoral commission said it would first release, one by
one, the results of the 500 Chamber of Deputies races, then
announce winners of the 64 Senate seats before issuing results of
the presidential balloting.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Bartlett, who heads the electoral
commission, said on Sunday the vote-counting process ``is a
question of patience. Politics is the science of patience.''
   He said the breakdown of a new computer system, then bad
weather, prevented the commission from delivering on its pledge to
release preliminary results on election night.
   The Salinas camp has privately acknowledged probable losses to
Cardenas in at least two states and Mexico City _ first-ever
defeats for the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has not
lost a presidential, senate or gubernatorial race since it was
founded in 1929.
   The governing party lost both senate seats in Cardenas' home
state of Michoacan, the government news agency Notimex reported
today. It did not say what party won and PRI officials could not be
reached for comment on the report.
   The surprisingly poor showing has produced a rift in the party
between Salinas supporters who want to modernize the party and an
old guard seeking to use the delay to embarrass the Salinas camp or
ensure traditional margins of victory.
   Bartlett was a top competitor to Salinas for the governing
party's presidential nomination.
   On at least two occasions, Salinas aides assured foreign
reporters the electoral count was proceeding smoothly and results
were imminent, only to be frustrated by commission announcements of
further postponement.
   Aides to Salinas argue that the delay only heightens
expectations of fraud and makes it more difficult for the new team
to embark on its agenda.
   The opposition charges that the governing party is devising
satisfactory electoral results before it releases them.
   ``The lack of information since the very day of the election has
created many doubts with respect to the correct management and the
credibility of the electoral figures,'' Cardenas said in a letter
to Bartlett released Sunday night.
   National Action Party members coordinated protests on Sunday,
particularly in Chihuahua state.
   Protesters blocked the Cordoba bridge, the main link between
Ciudad Juarez and El Paso, Texas; the smaller Zaragoza bridge about
eight miles east; and a bridge at Fabens, Texas, about 20 miles
east of El Paso.
   The Pan American highway outside the state capital of Chihuahua,
200 miles south of the U.S. border, was blocked by party members
Saturday night at the same time as the bridge takeover in Ciudad
Juarez.
   Similar traffic stoppages took place in the Chihuahua cities of
Delicias, Jimenez and Parral.
   Ramon Galindo, campaign coordinator for the National Action
Party, said the Federal Election Commission results showed that the
party had won all three races for the Juarez area lower chamber of
the national legislature.
   ``These numbers signify the death of the (governing party) in
Ciudad Juarez,'' Galindo said as about 1,000 people cheered and
then began departing the Cordova bridge. Another 200 protestors
were also leaving the blocked Zaragoza bridge.

   Opposition supporters shut down
three bridges spanning the U.S. border to protest delayed election
results, then lifted the blockades today when the government
announced that their party won local races.
   The protestors, adherents of the right-of-center National Action
Party, held the bridges for more than 26 hours in a peaceful
demonstration that began Saturday night.
   Their candidates won all three Juarez area races for the federal
legislature's lower house in last Wednesday's balloting.
   In Mexico City on Sunday, opposition activists held vigils
outside centers where ballots were being counted, saying they were
guarding against vote fraud.
   Also, supporters of presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas
of the National Democratic Front demonstrated outside the Interior
Ministry to demand that the government release vote tallies without
rigging the results.
   When the results were announced in this border city, local
National Action Party campaign coordinator Ramon Galindo said they
``signify the death of the (governing party) in Ciudad Juarez.''
   About 1,000 people cheered and then began leaving the Cordova
bridge, the main link between Juarez and El Paso, Texas. Another
200 protesters left the smaller Zaragoza bridge about eight miles
to the east. Protesters had also occupied a bridge 20 miles east of
the city.
   Traffic on Sunday was restricted to the two other bridges that
link Juarez with El Paso.
   As the bridge takeover began in Juarez, National Acton Party
party members blocked the Pan American highway outside the state
capital of Chihuahua, 200 miles south of the U.S. border.
   Similar traffic stoppages took place in the Chihuahua cities of
Delicias, Jimenez and Parral.
   Party leaders were vowing to continue their campaign of civil
resistance if they determined that the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was attempting to cheat them out of
electoral victory.
   Since its creation in 1929, PRI has never lost a gubernatorial
or presidential race. But it has long been accused of massive vote
fraud, especially in Chihuahua.
   The National Action Party is considered a contender in much of
Mexico's north.
   On the Cordova Bridge, the protesters had set up tents and tarps
to escape the sun and food and drink vendors plied their trade. The
air was almost festive there and at the Zaragoza bridge.
   After the government said it would release election results
Sunday night, local National Action Party leaders met and decided
to vacate the bridges as when the tallies were announced, said
party spokesman Francisco Barrio.
   In 1986, Barrio ran for Chihuahua governor and was defeated by
PRI candidate Hernando Baeza in what the National Action Party
termed massive vote fraud.

   The Piper Alpha oil and gas platform
was still burning and smoking early today, five days after
explosions and fire on the North Sea rig killed 166 men in the
world's worst oilfield disaster.
   The semi-submersible support rig, Tharos, found three more
bodies by early today, bringing the total recovered to 20.
   Texas oilfield fire and blowout specialist Red Adair, 73, and
his team waited on the rig to board the tilting, ruined platform.
Adair's team said they had planned to return to the platform today
to continue clearing debris before trying to cap a blazing wellhead.
   But a spokeswoman for the platform's operators, Occidental
Petroleum Corp., said Adair's plans were put on hold by 35 mph
winds and forecasts of possible lightning and thunderstorms.
   Adair said three or four of the platform's 36 wellheads were
still burning, two of them sending up flames 300 feet high. Other
wells have been fractured under the sea and are blowing gas to the
surface in huge bubbles.
   The team boarded the dangerously tilting platform at dawn Sunday
from the Tharos, but was forced off by high winds, heavy seas and a
surge of flames from one wellhead.
   The platform, stricken last Wednesday, stands on the seabed 120
miles northeast of the Scottish coast.
   ``The job will cost millions (of dollars) and it could be that
some of the oil outlets may be closed off permanently with concrete
plugs,'' said John Brading, chairman in Britain of the platform's
operators, Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corp.
   ``The noise from the well blowing out is like a jet plane and
water has to be continually sprayed on to try to keep the heat
down,'' Brading said.
   He said Adair's team would work as close as 10 feet to the
flames, protected by shields.
   ``If Red gets that close and says the job cannot be done, then
we will have to drill a second well and that could take three to
four weeks. Red has been extremely successful in the past, but
every well is different,'' Brading said.
   Gene Grogan, Occidental's vice president of engineering, said
Adair will try to pour in sea water, drilling mud or cement.
   ``If there are dangers in doing that, the other way is to drill
a relief well by drilling down to the same bottom hole location and
then pumping in fluid from there to the other well,'' he said.
   Fourteen of the 64 survivors were still being treated in
Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, three of them with extensive burns.
   The London newspaper Today said 6 million gallons of oil a day
were belching into the North Sea.
   It said that, despite ships working on the slick with dispersal
chemicals, dead seabirds smothered in oil were washing up along the
coast.
   The Department of Energy appointed Lord Cullen, a judge of the
Court of Session in Edinburgh, to head the public inquiry into the
disaster.
   More than 100 churches in Scotland held memorial services Sunday
for the victims.

<HEAD>Good Canola Harvest Helps Take Farmers' Minds Off Drought</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>

   The heat and drought are scorching corn
and soybeans, but a few farmers are counting the cash from a new
crop they just harvested. Canola.
   ``That probably will be the best crop I've got this year,'' said
Don Hiter, who sold about 1,000 bushels of the tiny, black oil-seed
from his 20-acre plot in DeWitt County. ``Everything else is in bad
shape.''
   Canola is a trademark for a variety of rape, a plant whose seeds
are crushed to produce oil for cooking and food production and meal
for livestock feed. Canada grows about 80 percent of the world
supply of rape and little has been raised in the United States.
   There were about 12,000 acres of the crop in Illinois, Indiana,
Ohio, Michigan and Kentucky this year, according to Tony Jones, a
representative of Canola, Inc., an Indianapolis-based seed
distributor.
   That could increase significantly in 1989 because the current
drought threatens to reduce the U.S. harvest of soybeans, another
oil-seed crop, said Jones.
   ``When we harvest Canola next year, we will be riding on the
effect of this drought and we'll still have high prices,'' said
Jones. ``We'll generate good cash flow and know we're getting the
best price of the year without having to tie up storage space.''
   Canola is planted in the fall and grows until cold weather
causes it to become dormant. It resumes its growth in the spring
and is harvested in late June or early July.
   ``It looks like sweet clover when it's in full bloom, covered
with yellow flowers,'' said Hiter. ``You can see it from miles
around. I had a lot of neighbors looking at it.''
   Canola survived the drought because it matured and was harvested
much earlier than the corn crop. The grain got an early start in
the spring, thus avoiding the harsh effects of the drought.
   The plant, which is related to mustard, is about four feet tall
and grows thick enough that ``it smothers all the weeds,'' said
Hiter, who farms 880 acres with his son near Weldon.
   Hiter said he was pleased with his yield of 50 bushels per acre.
   The 1988 Canola sold for $7.25 a bushel, but Hiter had to truck
the seed 100 miles to a grain elevator at Farina, one of only two
receiving points in Illinois.
   Roger Read, who operates a farm supply and grain marketing
business in Madison County, said he and some of his customers also
raised Canola this year. He said they had generally good results,
but hope there will be more places to sell the crop in the future.
   Another advantage of Canola, said Jones, is that the U.S. crop
is harvested earlier than spring-planted Canadian rapeseed, at a
time when processors need it.
   ``Canola gives you flexibility _ another option in your crop
rotation and a chance to spread out your workload,'' Read said.
``With the drought, canola was a bright spot this year _ something
to make you smile and get excited.''

<HEAD>Don't Take Blacks for Granted, Hooks Tells Democrats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats should not take blacks for granted,
and Republicans are making a mistake in ignoring the black vote,
says NAACP Executive Director Benjamin L. Hooks.
   Hooks opened the 79th annual convention of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People Sunday night with
a speech in which he also called on blacks to emphasize self-help.
   ``It would be a tragic mistake to take us for granted,'' Hooks
said in remarks aimed at the Democrats. ``Don't take us for
granted.''
   To the Republicans, he said, ``You're making a terrible mistake
to continue to ignore the black vote.''
   Blacks have won an inspiring measure of economic, political and
social freedom, Hooks said. But racism and hopelessness persist, he
added.
   He accused the Reagan administration of abandoning the war on
poverty and dismantling civil rights gains.
   ``The question tonight I propose is: Where do we go from here?''
Hooks said.
   In answering his own question, he said:
   ``First of all, we shall go forward to first class citizenship
only if we place renewed emphasis on self-help. What good is
freedom of thought if you can't think? What good is freedom of
speech if you can't speak?''
   Hooks praised Jesse Jackson's presidential campaign as
``brilliant and incredible'' but said the decision to seek or
accept the vice presidency ``is one that he alone has to make.''
   About 16,000 people are expected to attend the five-day
convention, whose theme is ``Vote! Be Heard.'' Vice President
George Bush, the expected Republican presidential nominee, is
scheduled to speak Tuesday and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis,
the expected Democratic nominee, is to address the convention
Wednesday.
   The 11-year-old grandson of Medgar Evers, the field secretary
for the NAACP in Mississippi who was shot to death in 1963, spoke
earlier Sunday in Arlington National Cemetery.
   ``If we didn't have those like Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr.
and Medgar Evers, we wouldn't be free today,'' said Daniel Evers
Everette. ``We wouldn't be able to go anywhere we want to. We
wouldn't be able to do anything we want to.''

<HEAD>Scientist Figures Out How Much Wood A Woodchuck Could Chuck</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Richard Thomas says he's tired of being
asked how much wood a woodchuck could chuck.
   ``They have to be trying to get one up on us well-versed
biologists,'' said Thomas, a fish and wildlife technician for the
state Department of Environmental Conservation. ``I felt it was
high time we replied.''
   So he decided to figure it out.
   First, Thomas consulted the dictionary for a definition of
chuck, which he found to mean ``to toss or discard.'' Woodchucks
can't chuck wood, but they do ``toss or discard'' dirt when they
are digging a burrow.
   Then, he told the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, he
researched woodchucks. He found they weigh 5 to 10 pounds and have
thick, strong legs, perfect for burrowing.
   Their homes consist of a main tunnel 25 to 30 feet long and six
inches wide with three rooms _ one ``spy'' tunnel, one for sleeping
and one for a toilet.
   The last step was figuring volume and weight.
   Thomas multiplied 35 square feet, the typical size of a
woodchuck burrow, by 20 pounds, the approximate weight of a square
foot of soil, to come up with what he believes is the answer to one
of the great unanswered questions of Western civilization.
   How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck
wood?
   ``Oh, about 700 pounds on a good day with the wind at his
back,'' said Thomas. ``I thought everybody knew that.''

Iran Says No</HEAD>

flight recorder not found; pickup 6th pvs, ``The United States

<DATELINE>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper reported today
that Iran recovered the flight recorder from the passenger jet a
U.S. Navy warship shot down over the Persian Gulf. Iran denied the
report.
   The Khaleej Times quoted unidentified salvage experts in Dubai
as saying the Iranians recovered the flight recorder from the Iran
Air A300 Airbus in the past few days.
   But Iran's navy commander said today that search teams have so
far failed to find the flight recorder, Tehran Radio reported.
   Commodore Mohammed Hussein Malekzadegan said in a radio
interview monitored in Cyprus that the recorder may have been
destroyed when the jetliner was shot down July 3 by a missile fired
by the USS Vincennes. Iran said all 290 people aboard were killed.
   The data stored in the recorder could be crucial in determining
whether the Airbus received radio warnings from the Vincennes. It
also could provide information about the aircraft's altitude and
other flight details.
   The newspaper referred to the recorder only as ``the black box''
and did not specify whether it was the flight data recorder or
voice recorder.
   The United States says the Vincennes' crew mistook the Airbus
for an F-14 fighter jet and claims the jet was descending in what
was seen a hostile flight pattern and did not respond to seven
radio warnings.
   Iran says the aircraft was operating normally and climbing as it
approached the vessel after taking off from Bandar Abbas, Iran, on
a 150-mile flight to Dubai.
   Meanwhile, a British intelligence report based on radio
communications monitored in the gulf criticizes the Navy for
shooting down the airliner, The Sunday Times of London reported.
   The report concludes that the flight left Bandar Abbas only
three minutes late, was on the correct flight path and was climbing
when it was shot down, the newspaper said.
   The Navy has said the jet was descending and took off an hour
late.
   The Khaleej Times quoted Italy's naval commander in the gulf,
Rear Adm. Angelo Mariani, as saying heavy traffic in the waterway
and the mixture of civilian and military craft will complicate
investigations into the tragedy.
   The newspaper quoted Mariani as saying the Italian frigate
Espero heard an unidentified U.S. warship issue warnings to an
aircraft shortly before the Airbus was shot down.
   He said the message was transmitted at least once on the
military air distress frequency.
   ``Since we only listen to military frequencies, I cannot confirm
whether the same message was repeated on the civilian international
frequency or not, but I assume it must have been,'' Mariani was
quoted as saying.
   The Pentagon says warnings were sent on both military and
civilian frequencies.
   The U.N. Security Council plans to hold an emergency meeting
Tuesday on the incident, but Iran's leaders expressed doubt that
the body will condemn the United States for the attack.
   ``In view of the council's past performance and also due to its
peculiar composition, Iran is not too optimistic on the outcome of
the session,'' Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati told reporters
in Tehran on Sunday.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Jawad Larijani said a U.S. veto
of a Security Council resolution that would condemn the attack
would not necessarily prompt a violent Iranian reaction.
   The United States, as one of the five permanent members of the
Security Council, has veto power.
   ``We prefer not to be hostile. We prefer that this case should
be settled diplomatically. But we are not naive not to see the
difficulties,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The trustee for PTL says he will examine
deposed founder Jim Bakker's proposal to buy back the ministry, but
he doesn't think Bakker's plan is viable.
   ``The real big problem for (Bakker) is that I think we're going
to have some better offers than his ... That's what we're waiting
on, to see if they develop,'' said the court-appointed trustee,
M.C. Benton.
   Bakker's plan to buy back the Christian retreat and television
ministry calls for PTL's assets to be appraised at $130 million and
all lawsuits against him to be dropped.
   Bakker's conditions were listed in a three-page letter to Benton
released Friday by Ryan Hovis, Bakker's attorney.
   Benton said he is uneasy about Bakker's plan to use the Heritage
USA theme park as collateral for the $100 million loan he will use
to buy the ministry. Benton said Bakker's lawsuits against the
ministry were another hurdle.
   In January, Bakker sued PTL to recover $1.3 million for a house
his family had lived in. That house was sold for $685,000.
   PTL countersued for more than $52 million, saying Bakker and his
wife, Tammy Faye, owed the ministry for excess salaries and
mismanagement.
   The letter released by Hovis did not shed any new light on who
would finance Bakker's $100 million loan. Bakker said the investor
is foreign and is the head of a company worth $2.3 billion.
   The ministry has been in financial straits since Bakker left in
March 1987 after relevations that he had a sexual tryst with church
secretary Jessica Hahn.
   Benton said he continues to hold talks with businessmen
interested in buying the theme park, just south of Charlotte, N.C.
He hopes to make a recommendation on a buyer to the bankruptcy
court by August.

<HEAD>U.N. Agency Projects Food Shortages Due To U.S. Drought</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The crippling drought hitting North America is
expected to reduce world grain stocks to levels that may cause food
shortages in many poor countries, the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization reported today.
   The agency projects world cereal production in 1988 to total
1.785 billion tons, only two million tons more than last year's
level, which was already below the expected production.
   If the drought in the United States ended now, grain production
would fall close to the low levels of 1983, when a drought and
farmers' participation in a government crop reduction program
decreased output, the agency reported.
   As a result, world grain stocks are projected to fall below 310
million tons, or 17 percent of the level the agency considers
necessary to safeguard world food security, the report said. If
crop conditions in the United States and Canada continue to
deteriorate, the ratio could drop even further.
   ``Such a development would have serious implications for the
food security, particularly of many low-income, food-deficit
countries,'' the report said.
   The high grain prices resulting from a lower supply would hit
poor, food-importing countries the hardest, the U.N. agency warned.
It said the rising prices could also reduce food aid from developed
countries.
   The most severely hit crops are coarse grains _ mostly maize,
barley and oats, the report said.
   The agency projected good harvests in other parts of the world.
In Asia the yearly monsoon rains started on time, and production in
Europe and the Soviet is expected to be larger than last year.
Grain production in South America should be slightly lower this
year than last.
   In the Sahel region of sub-Saharan Africa, however, locusts
flourishing in unexpectedly heavy rains have damaged this year's
harvest. Potential crop losses from the pests could hit 1 million
tons, FAO said.

<HEAD>Pueblo Commander Says Persian Gulf Sailors Face More Difficult
Task</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. forces on patrol in the Persian Gulf face
a more difficult situation than the crew of the USS Pueblo, says
the commander of the spy ship whose crew was imprisoned for 11
months in North Korea.
   ``I don't think the Persian Gulf is anywhere near the situation
we had,'' retired Navy Cmdr. Lloyd Bucher said at the 20th reunion
of the Pueblo crew this weekend. ``Those guys have it more
difficult over there.''
   The gulf is an all-out war, Bucher said.
   ``They're trying to deal with these harassing attacks and live
within very constricted rules of engagement,'' he said. ``I don't
see how any person in the history of the U.S. Navy has had to deal
with the tensions these guys are dealing with. I think they're
handling it extremely well.''
   The Pueblo, armed with only two .50-caliber machine guns and
hand-held firearms, was monitoring communist ship movements and
messages in international waters near the North Korean coast when
it was attacked by torpedo boats Jan. 23, 1968.
   One crewman died and 10 others were wounded before the vessel
was seized. The 82 survivors were taken to a prison camp, where
they endured beatings and physical and psychological torture.
   More than 40 Pueblo crew members gathered to renew ties and
discuss the hardships they endured.
   Retired Chief Petty Officer Jim Kell had boarded the Pueblo for
a 30-day assignment shortly before the ship became the first U.S.
military vessel to be captured since 1812.
   ``I would never say I wish it had been somebody else because
I've been through it and it's something I'm never going to
forget,'' Kell said. ``I wish I hadn't been through it, but I
wouldn't wish it on anybody.''
   ``It made 82 people become very close ... but I know some are
still bitter about it,'' said Kell, of El Cajon, Calif.
   Crewman Stu Russell said conversation at the weekend
get-together was ``standard reunion-type stuff about families, jobs
... and what percentage disability you get from the Veterans
Administration.''
   ``Almost invariably, the stories you hear are about funny or
stupid things that happened (during their ordeal). The real
heavyweight stuff isn't talked about much,'' said Russell, of
Eureka, Calif.
   ``It's still been kind of intense, but really good therapy.''
   The crew members were released on Dec. 23, 1968, after the nited
States apologized for ``grave acts'' committed against North Korea
in its claimed territorial waters.

   The government today said Carlos Salinas de
Gortari had a wide lead over his opponents but that election
results still were not final five days after voters cast ballots
for a new president.
   Opposition delegates to the Federal Electoral Commission
immediately denounced the partial results and said the information
was misleading.
   The partial results finally were released after opposition
activists blocked highways and shut down international bridges to
protest the delay.
   Charges of election fraud and the commission's delay in
releasing results clouded what had been expected to be an easy
victory for Salinas and his party, the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party.
   The election commission today said Salinas has won 52.89 percent
of the ballots counted so far. It said Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the
leftist National Democratic Front trailed with 29.10 percent, and
National Action Party candidate Manuel Clouthier was third with
16.68 percent.
   Earlier, Cardenas had claimed victory and Clouthier said he was
leading.
   Both men accused the governing party _ which has not lost a
presidential election since it was founded in 1929 _ of rampant
election fraud.
   Mexico has 38 million registered voters. The government said it
has counted about 13.24 million votes, but did not say how many
ballots were cast.
   Delegates to the commission from the opposition Mexican
Socialist Party and National Action Party said Interior Minister
Manuel Bartlett gave the results without consulting them first.
   They charged Bartlett, who heads the commission, bypassed
vote-counting procedures and said the information gave a misleading
impression that Salinas was near victory. They said Bartlett
released figures directly from districts without a check from the
commission's technical committee.
   ``Public opinion demands information, let's give information,''
Bartlett countered. ``Whether we want to consider it official or
unofficial, it is the information that comes from the district
committees by telephone and from the computation carried out
today.''
   The partial returns also gave 176 seats in the 500-seat Chamber
of Deputies to the governing party, 13 to the right-of-center
National Action Party and two to parties affiliated with the
National Democratic Front.
   The Chamber of Deputies is the lower house of Mexico's congress.
   The election commission only released percentage results for the
Mexican Senate, giving the governing party 60.95 percent of the
total Senate vote. The National Action Party had 15.59 percent and
Cardenas' party had 7.31 percent, the commission said.
   Opposition delegates demanded the commission provide
district-by-district figures for the Senate. Bartlett delayed
action on the request.
   The partial results were released early today at the end of an
election commission session in which opposition delegates
repeatedly accused the government of fraud and criticized the pace
of the vote count.
   Bartlett on Sunday defended the election process, calling it ``a
question of patience. Politics is the science of patience.''
   He said the breakdown of a new computer system, then bad
weather, prevented the commission from delivering on its pledge to
release preliminary results on election night. It then promised it
would release results on Sunday.
   The Salinas camp privately has acknowledged probable losses to
Cardenas in at least two states and Mexico City _ first-ever
defeats for the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has never
lost a presidential, senate or gubernatorial race.
   The surprisingly poor showing has produced a rift in the party
between Salinas supporters who want to modernize the party and an
old guard seeking to use the delay to embarrass the Salinas camp or
ensure traditional margins of victory.
   Bartlett was a top competitor to Salinas for the governing
party's presidential nomination.
   At least twice during the weekend, Salinas aides assured
reporters the electoral count was proceeding smoothly and results
were imminent, only to be frustrated by commission announcements of
further postponement.
   The opposition charges that the governing party is simply
devising satisfactory electoral results before it releases them.
   ``The lack of information since the very day of the election has
created many doubts with respect to the correct management and the
credibility of the electoral figures,'' Cardenas said in a letter
to Bartlett released Sunday night.
   National Action Party members coordinated protests on Sunday,
particularly in Chihuahua state.
   Hundreds of protesters who blockaded bridges across the Rio
Grande in Chihuahua state on Saturday went home early today after
the election commission released results that showed the National
Action Party won three congressional races in the Juarez area.
   Protesters blocked the Cordoba bridge, the main link between
Ciudad Juarez and El Paso, Texas; the smaller Zaragoza bridge about
eight miles east; and a bridge at Fabens, Texas, about 20 miles
east of El Paso.
   The Pan American highway outside the state capital of Chihuahua,
200 miles south of the U.S. border, also was blocked by party
members Saturday night.
   Similar traffic stoppages took place in the Chihuahua cities of
Delicias, Jimenez and Parral.

<HEAD>Officials Say Dynamite Blast Caused Mine Disaster</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KASSEL, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dynamite blast triggered the
underground explosion that killed 51 miners in West Germany's worst
mining disaster in 25 years, the prosecutor in Kassel said today.
   Shortly after the June 1 disaster, officials said they believed
methane gas had exploded in the Stolzenbach mine in Borken, about
70 miles northeast of Frankfurt.
   But prosecutor Stephan Walcher said today that the fatal
explosion was sparked when workers set off dynamite to close a
depleted shaft.
   Walcher said the dynamite blast ignited coal dust in the air,
sending a powerful shock wave through the mine.
   He noted that the use of dynamite is considered normal in mining.
   He also said investigators ruled out that a cigarette lighter
ignited the blast, as West German media speculated after the
disaster.
   Walcher said that the results of the investigation were only
preliminary and it would probably take several more months to
determine if the correct procedures were used in the blasting.
   Three days after the explosion, six surviving miners were
discovered 500 feet underground after their sounds were picked up
by a television crew's microphone, which was lowered into the shaft.
   Carbon monoxide poisoning killed most of the 51 miners who
perished.

<TEXT>
   Overflowing rivers inundated a widening
area of Bangladesh and claimed 15 more lives, raising the death
toll in a week of flooding to at least 136, newspapers reported
today.
   More than 5 million people have been driven from their homes,
mainly in the northeast, as rain-swollen rivers overflowed their
banks and swept through villages and farmlands, the reports said.
   They said the latest deaths occurred Sunday in the northeastern
district of Hobiganj, the northwestern districts of Gaibandha,
Kurigram and Jamalpur, and the central districts of Netrokona and
Comilla.
   Most of the town of Barahmanbaria, 50 miles east of Dhaka, was
under three feet of water and crops over a large surrounding area
were damaged or destroyed, according to officials, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   They said army troops were performing large scale rescue
operations, but many areas remain inaccessible because bridges are
flooded and there is not enough dry land for helicopters to land.
   Road and railway traffic between Dhaka and northeastern
districts today remain blocked for the seventh day because many
bridges and rail crossings are submerged.
   The waters of the Brahmaputra and Jammu rivers, which rose above
flood levels, rushed into neighboring India, the reports said.
   In northeastern India, seven people died in flooding in Assam
state and more than 3,000 families were left stranded in Tripura
state, Indian news agencies reported today.
   Floods are an annual threat in this country of 105 million
people with heavy monsoon rains, which are essential for the
country's rice crop. Bangladesh, one of the poorest nations in the
world, does not have the funds to build dams that would hold back
the flood waters.
   Last year, in the worst flooding in 70 years, some 25 million
people were driven out of their homes and more than 1,200 died.
   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad flew over flood-affected areas
on Sunday. Later, at an emergency Cabinet meeting, he ordered
government officials to personally supervise the relief operations.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed autographs and
mingled with flag-waving Poles today as the Soviet leader began a
six-day visit that is expected to focus on efforts to breathe life
into both countries' economies.
   Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski was at Okecie Airport as
Gorbachev's plane arrived on a mild, sunny morning after a two-hour
flight from Moscow. Gorbachev was accompanied by his wife, Raisa.
   After the official welcoming ceremonies, the Gorbachevs
approached a crowd of several hundred citizens waving Polish flags
on the tarmac. Gorbachev paused to sign several autographs and chat
with people in the crowd.
   On the drive into Warsaw, Gorbachev's motorcade made an
unannounced stop at a traffic circle, where the Soviet Communist
Party general secretary greeted onlookers and signed copies of his
book, ``Perestroika.'' The Polish-language edition is selling on
the Warsaw black market at double the official price of 550 zlotys
($1.25).
   Gorbachev and Jaruzelski later conferred privately at Communist
Party headquarters in Warsaw. A brief communique by the official
news agency PAP said the two exchanged views on economic, political
and social renewal taking place in their countries.
   During the unannounced stop at the traffic circle, which was
televised nationwide, Gorbachev told a neighborhood official: ``I
have arrived on your soil only a few minutes and all over I see
smiles and happy faces. I see your friendly relationship toward
us.''
   ``We feel the same way,'' said the neighborhood official.
   Gorbachev, who is personally popular in Poland, will be working
during the visit to overcome a traditional antipathy among Poles
toward Russians that has existed for centuries.
   His visit is to be capped at week's end by a summit meeting of
the leaders of the Warsaw Pact allies.
   It will be the first summit of the Soviet-led alliance since the
U.S.-Soviet summit in Moscow and since Gorbachev's program of
political and economic reform was soundly endorsed by the
extraordinary Communist Party conference last month in Moscow.
   Poland's leaders say the visit, coming so soon after the
conference, will give new impetus to their ``socialist renewal'' of
the economy and political system.
   The East bloc's best organized opposition, meanwhile, is seeking
assurances of less Soviet interference in Polish affairs.
   On the eve of the visit, however, seven members of the outlawed
Polish Socialist Party were detained when they met in an apartment
in the southwestern city of Wroclaw and police searched the Warsaw
home of the leader of the illegal anti-communist Confederation of
Independent Poland, opposition activists said.
   The banned Solidarity independent labor federation praised
Gorbachev's program of reform in the Soviet Union, saying it could
be significant ``if it serves for changes in the system in Poland
and creation of a new model of Polish-Soviet relations.''
   Solidarity also urged Gorbachev to renounce the ``Brezhnev
doctrine,'' named after the late Soviet leader who intervened in
the affairs of other East bloc countries, ostensibly to protect
their communist systems.
   Brezhnev was in power when the government of Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski quashed Solidarity with a December 1981 military
crackdown, outlawing the federation a year later.
   Gorbachev, in earlier visits to Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia,
has emphasized his view that every East bloc country should be free
to choose its own political course.
   Solidarity also called for ``clear and unambiguous words'' from
Gorbachev on the World War II massacre of 4,000 Polish army
officers in the Katyn forest near Smolensk, which has been blamed
on Soviet soldiers.
   During his visit, Gorbachev is to address the Sejm, or
parliament, and hold meetings with groups of young people, workers
and intellectuals and artists.
   Interest in the Warsaw Pact meeting has intensified amid signs
the Soviets may pull out some or all of their military forces from
Hungary, where 65,000 troops have been stationed since the Soviets
invaded in 1956 to end a rebellion.
   A State Department official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said in Washington last week that intelligence reports
indicated preparations for a Soviet pullout from Hungary.
   The Warsaw Pact includes the Soviet Union, Poland, East Germany,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria.

<HEAD>Officials Debate Great Lakes Diversion Proposal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The factories of the Midwest and the farms of
the South have a common stake in keeping Mississippi River
barge-traffic moving, even if it takes Great Lakes water to do the
job, Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., said today.
   ``If the farmers in the Mississippi delta go under, the
automobile workers in Detroit ... are going to go down also,''
Pryor said on the NBC-TV ``Today'' show.
   River shipping carries 60 percent of the nation's grain, 40
percent of its petroleum and 80 percent of its diesel fuel, Pryor
said.
   But Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., said during the program that
diverting Great Lakes water would be wasting a resource needed in
the drought.
   ``That fresh water in the Great Lakes is 95 percent of the fresh
surface water we have for the whole country,'' Riegle said. ``If we
send it down the Mississippi River to lift the level to float those
barges, that fresh water goes down the river and goes into the gulf
and becomes salt water. So we lose what is a precious resource.''
   Thirteen senators on Friday asked President Reagan to allow an
emergency diversion of water from the Great Lakes to the
Mississippi. They proposed increasing the flow from the lakes to
the river from the 3,000 cubic feet per second to 10,000 cubic feet
per second for 100 days.
   Supporters of diversion said the drought has depressed the
Mississippi River to its lowest level since record-keeping began in
1872, stranding as many as 3,000 barges with losses to the barge
and towing industry expected to run as high as $60 million.
   Opponents said water levels in the Great Lakes have dropped 3
feet in the last two years and the water is needed for Midwest
agriculture.
   House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said in a
Kalamazoo, Mich., speech he would not support efforts to divert
water from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River.
   ``The pressure to do it in times of emergency is great, but in
many ways it probably would be the worst time to lower the level of
the lakes because they're already down in a drought year,'' Foley
said Saturday.
   A 1986 law forbids new diversions of Great Lakes water for use
outside the lakes basin without approval of the governors of all
the states in the region.
   ``Diversion would be a short-sighted policy,'' said Ohio Gov.
Richard Celeste, chairman of the Council of Great Lakes Governors,
on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   ``I am deeply concerned about environmental and economic
consequences for people in the Great Lakes states and Canadian
provinces.''
   Each inch the lakes are lowered costs some $200 million in cargo
carried, $10 million in generating power and $3 million to $5
million in recreation revenue, he said.
   But Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., said on the same program that the
proposed diversion would lower the lakes by an inch or less while
raising the Mississippi up to 1 foot.
   The diversion of lakes water to the Mississippi was increased
during a drought in the 1950s, ``and there were no serious
environmental effects,'' Sasser said.

   About 100 local supporters of one of Mexico's
opposition party presidential candidate called on that country's
government to release the results of last week's election.
   ``We want the government to respect the decision of the
people,'' Salvador Vasquez, president of Mexicans in Support of
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, said Sunday at a rally in front of the Mexican
Consulate.
   Protesters here and across Mexico claim the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party or PRI is fraudulently withholding returns from
Wednesday's election to manipulate them in favor of its candidate,
Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   Cardenas, who broke with the PRI last year, claimed victory
Saturday as the candidate of the leftist National Democratic Front.
   ``We will not tolerate fraud any longer regardless of where we
are,'' said Isabel Vasquez, representing a coalition of voting
rights groups in California which include many Mexican nationals.
   The Mexican government said today, after opposition activists
blocked highways and shut down international bridges to protest the
delay, that Salinas had a wide lead over his opponents but that
results still were not final.
   Manuel Clouthier of the right-wing National Action Party said
his party's figures showed he was ahead in the presidential
balloting.

   A rented car packed with explosives, hand
grenades and automatic weapons exploded today on the main shore
road outside Athens, killing two people, police said.
   The blast occurred at 2:50 p.m. in the seaside suburb of Paleo
Faliron, 4 miles from the Greek capital, a police spokeswoman said.
She said the explosion dismembered the bodies.
   Police said the car containing the exlosives and arms had been
rented to a 36-year-old Lebanese man, Hamoud Al Hamid.
   Police said they had no evidence to indicate American military
personnel had been the target of the blast. They declined to
speculate on what set off the explosives.
   The explosion occurred 10 miles north east of the Hellenic Air
Base, which is staffed by about 700 U.S. Air Force personnel.
   Today's seafront blast came 13 days after the American military
attache to Greece, Navy Capt. William E. Nordeen, was assassinated
by a booby-trapped car that exploded as he drove past in his
bullet-proof car on his way to work.
   The driver of a taxi that was also destroyed by today's blast
said she heard three successive explosions.
   ``The earth really shook as both cars went up in flames,'' said
Vasilliki Tsami, who had been taking a refreshment at a kiosk on
the shore road near a small beach when the explosion occurred. Her
taxi was parked alongside the rented car.

   Israeli troops fired on stone-throwing high
school students in the occupied West Bank today, killing a
16-year-old Palestinian, hospital officials said.
   Economics Minister Gad Yaacobi, meanwhile, said the 7-month-old
Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied
territories has cost Israel more than $600 million. The figure
included Israeli losses in tourism, export and production revenues,
he said.
   Israel's gross national product was $27 billion in 1987,
including $1.6 billion from tourism. In May, tourist officials said
they expected tourism income to drop by about $300 million this
year, mainly because of the uprising.
   In the West Bank village of Anabta today, troops fired on
students who hurled rocks and empty bottles at them after classes
let out, hospital officials in nearby Tulkarem said.
   Hassan Addas was shot three times in the chest, said the
hospital officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. The army
said it was investigating.
   The death brought to 219 the number of Palestinians killed in
the uprising, according to U.N. figures. Four Israelis have also
died.
   Several Israeli Arabs suspected of carrying out arson attacks on
forests and farmland in Israel have been jailed for six months
without trial, the daily Yediot Ahronot reported.
   The newspaper said Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin signed the
order jailing the men from the northern Galilee who allegedly
belonged to an anti-Israeli group called Sons of the Village.
   The defense ministry declined comment.
   Since the uprising began Dec. 8, more than 2,000 Palestinians
from the occupied lands have been jailed for up to six months
without trial under administrative detention, but such measures
rarely have been taken against Israeli Arabs.
   On Sunday, Israeli soldiers fatally shot an Arab youth and
seriously wounded another in West Bank clashes and the army
demolished the homes of five Gaza Strip residents accused of
hurling firebombs at troops.
   Troops shot and killed an Askar resident when Arab youths
erected roadblocks of burning tires and stones along the main
highway outside the camp and hurled rocks at troops, the army said.
   The army later clamped a curfew on Askar's 8,200 residents.
   Officials at Al Ittihad Hospital in Nablus said 17-year-old
Zubdi Mansour Isragi died after a bullet pierced an artery in his
thigh.
   Ittihad officials said the 18-year-old youth was in grave
condition with a gunshot wound in the chest.
   The army did not confirm the report, but said three Arabs were
hurt by gunfire or rubber bullets during a clash in the
marketplace. It did not elaborate.
   Five Israeli soldiers, among them a woman, were indicted on
charges they beat bound Arab detainees and humiliated them by
forcing them to make animal sounds, an Israeli newspaper reported.
   An army official confirmed Sunday that indictments were handed
up in the case, but said he could not provide details.
   An Israeli army lieutenant and four soldiers were indicted
Friday on charges they abused prisoners at the Dahariya detention
center near Hebron, Yediot Ahronot said.
   On March 28, the officer ordered detainees to curse Palestine
Liberation Organization leaders, the newspaper quoted the
indictment as saying. Prisoners who refused were kicked and struck
in the head and chest.
   A military policeman punched a bound and blindfolded prisoner
who was later hospitalized with internal bleeding, the newspaper
said. The officer also smashed the heads of other prisoners against
a wall, the report said.
   Another soldier forced detainees to make animal sounds and beat
them with sticks when they refused, according to the paper.
   The newspaper said the complaints against the five were lodged
by other soldiers.

   All main roads into Custer State Park were
reopened today, a week after lightning sparked a fire that
eventually burned 17,000 acres of timber and came within 3{ miles
of Mount Rushmore National Memorial.
   The fire, which was controlled Sunday afternoon, had been
contained within a 30-mile fire line a day earlier.
   Custer State Park is adjacent to U.S. Forest Service land that
surrounds Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills in western South
Dakota. The 73,000-acre park is the second largest state park in
the nation.
   The park was reopened Sunday but visitors were not allowed back
into all of it Sunday because of traffic problems on the narrow
roads as mop-up crews worked, said fire information officer Lynn
Young.
   ``It's not because of the fire but because of all the vehicles
and the buses and the crews moving around doing mop-up,'' Young
said.
   Two fire crews and two engines continued working today, dousing
lingering embers until there is no more smoke. One helicopter also
was kept on alert and a bulldozer was used to clean out fire lines.
   In addition, roads and campgrounds were still being cleared of
fire debris and utility workers were restoring electricity and
replacing utility poles that were burned in the fire, said fire
information officer Richard Homann.
   The fire, which began July Fourth, was contained after
thundershowers moved through and doused the fire with about a
quarter inch of rain, Young said.
   Lightning from the storms started nine additional fires, but
they were handled by local firefighters, he said.
   ``It's enough to keep us a little nervous, but we haven't got a
big one going,'' he said.
   Young said the Black Hills were just entering the main fire
season, but the drought brought fire problems early this year.
   Elsewhere, firefighters in the Bridger-Teton National Forest in
Wyoming contained the last major fire burning in the forest, the
200-acre ``Pocket'' fire, beating a storm front expected to reach
the area later today with high wind.
   However, three fires in Yellowstone National Park covering
almost 1,900 acres continue to burn unchecked, although park
officials said rain slowed the flames somewhat. Because the fires
were started by lightning, officials will allow them to burn unless
the approach the park's northern border.

<TEXT>
   The prime minister of the Persian Gulf
sheikdom of Kuwait opened week-long talks today with senior Reagan
administration officials after concluding an agreement with the
Soviet Union to buy military equipment.
   His visit is the first by a Kuwaiti leader since 1968.
   The prime minister met first with Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci and planned to meet later in the day with Deputy Secretary
of State John Whitehead.
   At the top of Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheik Saad
Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah's agenda was a move by Congress last week to
block a purchase of air-to-surface missiles from the United States.
   Opponents of the deal were concerned the Mavericks could be used
against Israel in the event of another Middle East war.
   The missiles were stripped from a $1.8 billion package of 40
F-18 jet fighter bombers. The White House and the State Department
criticized the congressional action and said Kuwait should be
enabled to defend itself with U.S. weapons.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the oil-rich
country faced a threat from Iran.
   The crown prince flew to Washington on Sunday aboard a jumbo jet
that was hijacked in April, to underscore his country's
denunciation of terrorism. The same pilot was at the controls.
   Kuwait has staunchly refused to negotiate with terrorists. It
has sustained atttacks but refused to yield 17 prisoners held on
terrorism charges.
   The country is considered pro-Western, but has dealt with the
Soviet Union over the years. The Kuwaiti defense ministry said
Saturday the arms deal with Moscow was in accordance with a policy
of having a diversified source of weapons.
   In statements published Sunday in Kuwaiti newspapers, Sheik Saad
said the choice of the jet, named Al-Jaberiya, was made ``to
symbolize Kuwait's firm rejection of terrorism and blackmail.''
   The emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, also flew
aboard Al-Jaberiya when he attended the emergency Arab summit
conference in Algiers that concentrated on the Palestinian problem.
   It was in the Algerian capital that a group of terrorists, said
to be pro-Iranian Moslem fundamentalists, released the plane that
they commandeered April 5 from a Bangkok-Kuwait flight after a
16-day ordeal and the killing of two Kuwaiti passengers.
   Another Kuwait Airways jetliner was hijacked in 1985, when two
American passengers were murdered. In both instances, Kuwait stood
fast against the demand of the terrorists for the release of 17
companions in Kuwaiti jails, convicted for the 1983 car bombing of
the U.S. and French embassies.
   Three of the 17 were sentenced to death but the sentences have
not yet been carried out. Their release is also a demand of the
Islamic Jihad group in Beirut in return for release of the American
hostages that it holds.
   Sheik Saad was interviewed by editors of the Kuwaiti newspapers
Al-Watan and Kuwait Times while aboard Al-Jaberiya, which is named
after the emir.
   He said his meeting on Tuesday with President Reagan and with
other U.S. officials throughout the week would center on
``bilateral relations, the Iraq-Iran war, the Middle East problem
and the Palestinian uprising.''

<HEAD>Running Mate Choice Looms For Dukakis; Bush Tries to Counter
Ethics Gap</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS day of Dukakis speech to Wednesday in 9th graf, Bush

   Michael Dukakis was back in his home base of Boston today, ready
for a final round of deliberations on who will join him on the
Democratic ticket. Jesse Jackson says he expects to speak privately
with Dukakis in the coming week about the vice presidency.
   As the running drama over a running mate for Dukakis plays on,
Democrats were preparing for the opening of their convention a week
from today in Atlanta.
   Republican George Bush, meanwhile, was returning to Washington
today after a weekend at his seaside retreat in Kennebunkport,
Maine. Aides speaking on condition of anonymity said the vice
president, the certain Republican nominee, was preparing to propose
a strict new conflict-of-interest code for public officials.
   Dukakis has frequently attacked Bush over the ethics of Reagan
administration officials including Attorney General Edwin Meese
III, who last week announced plans to step down.
   Meese, who was under investigation for a year, declared himself
vindicated after an independent counsel decided not to seek an
indictment of him.
   With Meese on the way out, campaign sources said the vice
president hopes to take the offensive on the ethics issue. They
said he would spell out his proposals later this month.
   Bush himself was the target of accusations last week from
Democratic Party chief Paul Kirk, who accused him of using public
funds to pay for campaign appearances. Bush aides denied the
allegations.
   The vice president's only public appearance over the weekend was
at a Lithuanian festival on Sunday near his vacation home. He said
reforms in the Soviet Union signal a ``time of hope,'' but warned
against ``complacency or weakness'' in dealing with Moscow.
   Bush and Jackson were speaking to the same agricultural group
this afternoon in Washington. And all three contenders had
appearances set at the NAACP's convention in Washington, Bush and
Jackson on Tuesday and Dukakis on Wednesday.
   Dukakis, who is struggling to resolve a budget crunch in his
home state, was turning his attention to gubernatorial business
today after a four-day Western trip.
   In a string of appearances during his last pre-convention
campaign swing, Dukakis took Bush to task on a variety of issues,
from the Pentagon procurement scandal to the vice president's
no-tax-hike pledge.
   Dukakis says Bush's support for higher fees for some government
services amounts to backing higher taxes. Bush disputes that.
   Even as he sought to turn up the heat on Bush, Dukakis responded
coolly to talk of possible convention disputes with Jackson.
   ``I think Jesse Jackson can do anything he wants to do,''
Dukakis told reporters in Estes Park, Colo., on Sunday. ``I'm going
to the convention and I'm going to win it.''
   Although Dukakis has the delegates to win the nomination on the
first ballot, Jackson said over the weekend that ``my name will be
in nomination.''
   ``Let no one mislead you. This is not the time for the campaign
to wind down,'' Jackson told his Texas delegates in Forth Worth on
Sunday night.
   He suggested that some disagreements with the Dukakis camp would
be aired at the convention.
   ``When you have unresolved matters, you have created tension,''
he told the delegates.
   However, he denied reports his forces might stage a walkout at
the convention over platform disputes.
   ``It would not be to our advantage to walk out,'' Jackson said
Saturday in Los Angeles. ``The threat is not that we're going to
walk out. The threat is that we're going to stay and expand and
build and grow and make a difference.''
   Although Jackson has met several times with Dukakis in recent
weeks, he says the two have yet to discuss in depth the possibility
of Jackson being on the ticket. Jackson said he expects to have
such a private talk before the start of the convention on July 18.
   The leading contenders for the vice presidential nomination are
believed to be Sens. John Glenn of Ohio, Bob Graham of Florida,
Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, along with
Reps. Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Lee Hamilton of Indiana.
   The Republicans, for their part, intend to fight for a share of
the spotlight during the Democratic convention. Bush intends to
campaign next week during the gathering, but spokeswoman Sheila
Tate says details of his schedule have not yet been set.

   A court today convicted four right-wing
terrorists of mass murder and sentenced them to life in prison for
the 1980 bombing of the Bologna train station, which killed 85
people.
   Investigators said the Aug. 2, 1980, attack on the station's
waiting room was the work of neo-Fascists, possibly with the help
from elements of Italy's secret services seeking to destabilize the
country and establish a right-wing dictatorship.
   Sentenced to life were Valerio Fioravanti, 43-year-old
Massimiliano Fachini, 40-year-old Sergio Picciafuoco and Francesca
Mambro. Ages were not given for Fioravanti and Ms. Mambro.
   Also today, two defendants were acquitted of mass murder charges
stemming from the bombing and 11 others were acquitted of
subversive association charges.
   Eight of the defendants were convicted and three acquitted on
charges of belonging to an armed band, a blanket charge in
terrorist cases. Sentences ranged from six to 16 years.
   The jury verdicts were read by presiding judge Mario Antonnaci
in Bologna criminal court.
   Among those acquitted on charges of subversive association were
Licio Gelli, two other reputed leading right-wing terrorists _
Francesco Pazienza and Stefano delle Chiaie _ and two former
officials of Italy's secret service police force SISMI _ Gen.
Pietro Musumeci and Col. Giuseppe Belmonte.
   Prosecutor Libero Mancuso said Gelli and Pazienza were convicted
of ``crimes against the democratic order, that is covering up the
responsibility of the authors (of the bombing). They are thus both
directly connected to the massacre.''
   Gelli, Pazienza and the former secret service officials were
convicted on charges of aggravated slander in connection with
attempts to mislead investigators in the case. Gelli was sentenced
to five years on the charge, while the three others were each given
three-year terms.
   Gelli will not have to serve the sentence because under terms of
his extradition from Switzerland last year he can only be tried in
Italy in connection with the 1982 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano, the
biggest banking scandal in postwar Italy.
   Gelli, who headed the Propaganda Due lodge, which has been
accused of conspiracy to bring down the constitutional government
and sponsoring right-wing terrorism, is charged with fraudulent
bankruptcy in the Banco Ambrosiano case.

   To critics, ferrets are ill-tempered little
cousins of the weasel: sharp-fanged beasts that threaten to spread
rabies and look like stretched-out rats when their owners parade
them around on leashes.
   George Harmon, head of the International Ferret Association,
offers a contrasting view: ``Ferrets are love with four legs.''
   Jennifer Au would surely agree. The 19-year-old Manassas woman
went to jail for refusing to produce a ferret authorities believe
may have bitten a 5-year-old boy.
   Ms. Au faces a contempt of court hearing Thursday after
arranging to have her ferret whisked away to a location she claims
not to know. Meanwhile, the boy has had to undergo rabies shots
with potentially dangerous side effects.
   Ms. Au spent five days in jail on a contempt-of-court charge to
protect her ferret from being killed to perform a rabies test,
displaying a loyalty Harmon said is not uncommon among the
tightknit society of ferret lovers.
   ``I'm really surprised somebody hasn't gotten killed over a
ferret,'' said Harmon, a longtime fancier of the animal whose
international network has its headquarters in a small office above
the Better Business Bureau.
   ``If somebody comes into your house to impound your ferret,
wouldn't you fight to protect it?'' he said. ``Particularly if it
was innocent.''
   Harmon's group, which claims more than 100,000 members in 19
countries, registers about 1,500 ferrets per month, sort of what
the American Kennel Club does for dogs, but not all its tasks are
so mundane.
   Some ferret lovers rescue the animals from authorities in
California, where owning the animals is banned, while others hide
them in New England states where they are outlawed.
   The International Ferret Association is also preparing to wage a
battle to prevent ferrets from being used as laboratory animals at
the University of Oregon.
   The group is raising money to try to keep Ms. Au out of jail. So
far it has collected more than $300. Harmon acknowledges that her
fight to save her ferret ``is the worst case we've ever had.''
   Authorities must remove the heads of ferrets to test them for
rabies, a viral disease of the central nervous system. Ms. Au
maintains they have already decapitated the ferret that actually
bit the child, as well as a third ferret that was at the scene. The
authorities found no rabies.
   The lack of reliable rabies tests that can be performed on
living ferrets is cited by officials who try to keep the furry
animals outlawed.
   Doctors also have documented cases of ferrets attacking babies,
mutilating ears and noses. Some officials worry that ferrets will
establish colonies in the wild and disrupt the environment.
   Harmon said at least six states _ California, New Hampshire,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Georgia and Hawaii _ have passed laws
that force ferret owners underground. Federal statistics show
ferrets are far less likely to spread rabies than dogs and cats, he
said.
   Harmon said he has been bitten thousands of times in the 32
years he has owned ferrets, which have been used for centuries to
catch rats, mice and rabbits. He has never contracted rabies and
said few cases of the disease have been attributed to the animals,
which he said number up to 8 million in the United States.
   ``They've got a mouth _ anything with a mouth will bite,''
Harmon said. ``They have teeth like cats. Yeah, they'll draw blood,
but they'll hold on. They don't bite and let loose and bite again,
like dogs.''

   Sammy Ray has been ``bootlegging'' research
funds to study oysters for 40 years, but the money has been a
pittance against the diseases that have ravaged oyster populations
in bays from Maryland to Texas.
   And now this summer's drought _ from the Eastern Shore of
Maryland to the nation's midsection _ promises to destroy more
oyster beds from the Chesapeake Bay to the Gulf of Mexico.
   ``We're facing one of the most severe crises we've ever had in
the gulf,'' says Ray, oyster researcher and coordinator of graduate
and special programs at Texas A&M University.
   The situation appears just as dire along the once oyster-rich
shores of the Chesapeake Bay, where Rep. Roy Dyson worries that a
way of life since colonial days may become nothing more than fodder
for National Geographic specials on vacant shucking houses and
packing sheds.
   ``We're on a crash course with disaster if something doesn't
happen,'' Larry Simns, president of the Maryland Watermen's
Association, testified before a House committee last month.
   Dyson, watermen and researchers are making their case for the
federal government's first concerted study of the oyster _ which
Dyson calls the world's most commercially valuable shellfish.
   Researchers say they know little about the diseases, Dermo and
MSX, that have wiped out oysters in the Delaware Bay, reduced
harvests by up to 90 percent in some parts of the Chesapeake Bay,
and wallop the gulf from year to year.
   But they do know Dermo and MSX are one-celled parasites that
flourish when temperatures soar and salinity rises because of low
freshwater runoff, Ray said.
   ``We have been helping ourselves to the oyster these many
centuries we've been in Maryland, and now we've got to lend a hand
to help the oyster,'' says Dyson, D-Md.
   Without intervention, he says, ``watermen of the Chesapeake Bay
will become watermen of the past. A whole way of life will change
on the Chesapeake Bay, and it's not for the better.''
   Dyson has introduced legislation that would set aside $68
million over 10 years to support oyster research projects through a
National Oyster Disease Program to be administered by the chief
scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   According to the staff of the House Committee on Merchant Marine
and Fisheries, the domestic oyster harvest has declined since the
early 1900s. Landings fell from 90 million pounds in meat weight in
1929 to an average of 54 million pounds in the 1970s. The dropped
further to 46 million pounds in 1986. The dollar value of the 1986
harvest was about $78 million.
   Both Dermo and MSX are at record levels in the Chesapeake and 30
percent to 50 percent of the oysters harvested in 1986-1987 died
from the diseases. From a level of 27 million pounds harvested in
1963-64, Ray said the bay's harvest dropped to 8 million pounds by
the mid-1980s.
   The Gulf of Mexico harvest varies annually according to climatic
conditions, ranging in recent years from lows of 13 million to 15
million pounds a season to highs of 25 million pounds, Ray said.
   A recent study found Dermo widely distributed in the most
productive areas of the gulf, with up to 50 percent of the oysters
dying of the disease in some of the primary production areas of
Texas and Florida.
   The Pacific oyster business reported major mortalities in the
late 1960s and 1970s and scientists have been unable to identify a
specific disease, the staff said.
   Although the Gulf Coast has not shown a downward trend like the
Chesapeake, Ray worries that may happen, ``particularly if we don't
get a break in the drought.'' A 50 percent drop in production is
possible.
   Nevertheless, ``it's very difficult for us to get funding for
sustained research.''
   Although the dry weather has emperiled many oyster beds, health
officials in Louisiana earlier this month opened thousands of acres
of beds closed for 20 years because the drought-lowered Mississippi
River is carrying less sewage and industrial waste into the gulf.
With the river flow lowered, less pollution is being spewed into
coastal areas where oysters grow.
   While some may dismiss the oyster as nothing more than a
delicacy, Ray, who has a doctorate in biology, says oyster beds are
significant in an estuary's ecosystem.
   ``Some of the best fishing areas are oyster reefs _ a lot of
organisms are attracted to oysters, and they attract fish.''

   A gasoline tanker truck exploded today
while unloading fuel, burning down an oil company office, sending
flames 500 feet into the sky and injuring two people, authorities
said.
   The explosion occurred about 7 a.m. as the truck driver was
unloading fuel into an underground tank at Plains Oil Co., a mile
west of this northeastern Colorado community, authorities said.
   The driver told ambulance attendants that he was climbing into
the truck cab to turn off the engine when the blast hit.
   Officials said a volunteer firefighter who lives near the Plains
Oil office, Jeff Hunker, dragged the driver away from the flames.
   The fire, visible up to five miles away, was so hot that
firefighters had to wait 45 minutes before they could begin
battling it. The crews trained hoses on gasoline storage tanks to
keep them from exploding.
   The fire spread to the Plains Oil office and burned it to the
ground. The truck cab and tank melted, officials said.
   Authorities evacuated a nearby park, officials said.
   The tanker truck driver was in critical condition and was to be
transferred to the burn unit at University Hospital in Denver, said
Rhonnie Kuebler of Sterling Regional MedCenter.
   A Plains Oil employee was listed in fair condition at the
Sterling hospital, Kuebler said.

   U.S. officials expressed optimism for
prospects of peace in Angola as South Africa, Angola, Cuba and the
United States opened talks today aimed at ending the long-running
conflict.
   The officials met at the U.S. Coast Guard base on Governors
Island in New York harbor for talks that are expected to end late
Tuesday or early Wednesday, said Anne Stoddard, a spokeswoman for
the U.S. Mission to the United Nations.
   U.S. officials in Washington said there were some hopeful signs
on a timetable for a Cuban troop withdrawal from Angola as part of
a peace settlement. A peace settlement may also be linked to black
majority rule in Namibia.
   One indication is that the Soviet Union, which has provided
Angola's Marxist government with billions of dollars in military
equipment since 1975, has shown interest in ending the conflict
there through a negotiated settlement, said the officials, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   They also say Angola for the first time has accepted the
principle of a total Cuban troop withdrawal.
   But Cuba has steadily increased its troop commitment to Angola
in the past six months. Close to 50,000 Cubans are believed to be
stationed there, compared with 35,000 to 37,000 last fall, the
officials said.
   According to the U.S. officials, Cuba probably has increased its
troop deployment to strengthen its bargaining position for the
negotiations.
   The U.S. goal is to achieve a timetable for a full Cuban troop
withdrawal that would take place simultaneously with implementation
of a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for
independence in neighboring Namibia, which has been administered by
South Africa for 70 years.
   Angola and Cuba thus far have said the Cuban withdrawal should
take place over four years, while the Namibian independence process
should be consistent with the one-year timetable specified in the
U.N. resolution.
   But the Reagan administration sees the four-year proposal for
the Cuban withdrawal as an opening bargaining position that is
subject to change as peace talks proceed. Disagreement over a
timetable for a Cuban pullback is probably the most difficult
unresolved issue.
   The four parties first met in London in early May and then
reconvened late last month in Cairo, Egypt. In Cairo, the parties
agreed that a statement of principles governing future negotiations
would be useful.
   The U.S. delegation will be led by Assistant Secretary of State
Chester Crocker, who heads the African affairs bureau and has been
working on a southern Africa peace settlement since he joined the
administration in 1981.
   The Angola civil war and the struggle for independence in
Namibia are among the oldest armed conflicts in the world.
   The United States is a party to the Angolan conflict because it
has been supporting an anti-communist guerrilla movement since
1985. But the administration does not regard this involvement as an
appropriate item for the ongoing negotiations because it believes
the talks should focus on the withdrawal of foreign forces from
that country.
   South Africa has repeatedly sent troops across the border into
Angola in support of the U.S.-backed rebel forces there. Angola's
government wants the permanent withdrawal of all South African
forces from Angola.
   Shortly after the Cairo talks ended in late June, South African
troops clashed with Cuban and Angolan forces in southwest Angola
near the Namibian border.

   President Reagan has approved U.S.
compensation for the families of the 290 people who died aboard the
Iranian airliner shot down by a U.S. warship, the White House
announced today.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwarter said Reagan was acting to ``ease the
hardship of the families'' and said no money would go to the
Iranian government.
   Fitzwater said that the amount of compensation had not yet been
decided upon and that the payments could be subject to
congressional approval.
   Fitzwater said the payments would be made through an
intermediary party, whom he did not name.
   He said that Reagan, while believing that the ``actions of the
USS Vincennes ... were justified defensive actions,'' was also
``saddened at the tragic deaths of the innocent victims of this
accident.''
   The spokesman stressed that the payments would be ``ex gratia,''
or voluntary, and would be subject ``to normal U.S. legal
requirements, including, if necessary, action by Congress.''
   Consequently, he said, ``details concerning time, amount and
other matters remain to be worked out.''
   Fitzwater also reiterated the U.S. position that Iran bears a
``heavy burden'' for allowing the Iran Air jetliner to fly over an
area where a firefight was raging between the Vincennes and Iranian
gunboats.
   Minutes before Fitzwater met with reporters, Reagan as much as
confirmed that compensation would be paid.
   Posing for photographers with Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon
Duarte and asked about the matter, Reagan commented, ``Well, I have
said from the start that we are a compassionate people.''
   Reagan has said that he regretted the shooting down of the Iran
Air Airbus on July 3 by the USS Vincennes, a Navy cruiser whose
captain had thought the ship was under attack by an F-14 Iranian
fighter jet.
   The Pentagon says the Vincennes' sophisticated Aegis radar and
tracking system had picked up a radio identification from the
Airbus broadcast on a frequency used only by military aircraft,
leading Capt. Will C. Rogers III to conclude that his ship faced
attack from an F-14.
   But the president also told reporters last week that he didn't
want to move too quickly on the question of compensation, saying at
one point that ``I will await the result of the investigation'' by
a naval investigative team sent to the Persian Gulf.
   But, when asked during the Oval Office picture-taking session
today whether he had decided that compensation should be granted,
the president said, ``We are a compassionate people and I think we
all have compassion for the families of those unfortunate people.''
   When he said that a statement would be coming, a reporter
responded, ``I assume it's going to be in the affirmative.''
   Reagan nodded his agreement.
   Asked about public opinion polls showing that a majority of
Americans surveyed had said they opposed paying such compensation,
the president said, ``I think that they have tied that to our
feelings about the government and what it did with regard to our
people in the embassy there (in Tehran) when the ayatollah
(Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini) came in.''
   In saying there would be no payments to Khomeini's government,
Reagan said:
   ``We don't feel that any such thing is called for. As I've said,
we all can have compassion for the innocent people who are the
victims.''
   Asked whether sending such compensation might send a bad signal,
he said, ``I don't ever find compassion a bad precedent.''
   Asked if he could say how much money would be involved, Reagan
replied, ``Don't know.''
   He did say ``there are some details about that that are still
being considered and worked out.''
   Administration officials had hinted over the weekend that a
decision to award compensation was near.
   ``We want to do the right thing,'' Michael Armacost, the
undersecretary of state, said Sunday.
   Armacost said that as compensation for relatives of ``innocent
victims of an air tragedy, ... we are considering a humanitarian
payment to the victims' families, and that includes a lot of third
country national families.''
   The payments would be ``ex gratia,'' he said, using a legal term
that translates from Latin as ``out of grace'' and means that the
party making compensation does not acknowledge culpability.
   Administration officials have argued that Iran should have
ensured that the airliner did not fly over a firefight that they
say was started by Iranian forces. They also say the airplane
ignored 12 warnings from U.S. warships and did not adequately
identify itself as a commercial flight.
   ``We would not contemplate payments to the Iranian government.
... I think one possibility would be through the Red Cross or
through the Red Crescent, humanitarian organizations who would deal
ith the individuals,'' Armacost said during an appearance on the
CBS-TV program ``Face the Nation.''
   The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Vernon Walters, said
that when Iran takes its case before an emergency meeting of the
Security Council on Tuesday, he will ``defend the circumstances
under which this occurred.''
   ``And above all, I'm going to urge that the way to stop these
incidents in the future is to stop the war, in accordance with the
resolution of the United Nations, of which Iran is a member,''
Walters said on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley.''
   ``We have always maintained that the way to stop these incidents
is to stop the war,'' Walters said. ``Nearly a year ago, the
Security Council passed a mandatory, obligatory resolution, 598,
calling on all belligerents to stop the hostilities, to withdraw to
internationally recognized boundaries, to exchange prisoners of
war, to set up an impartial group to consider the origins of the
war, and the cost of reconstruction.''
   Armacost disputed an accusation by the Iranian ambassador to the
United Nations, Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati, that the United States
is siding with Iraq in the war.
   Because Iraq has accepted the resolution and Iran has not,
Armacost said, ``we have ... felt it was appropriate to generate
pressure to encourage Iran to comply'' by protecting oil tankers in
the gulf from Iranian attack.
   The United States has increased the number of warships it
maintains in the Persian Gulf since it agreed last year to put
American flags on 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers and escort them through
the waterway. Last September, the administration directed U.S.
commanders to assist other tankers that came under attack, even if
they did not carry the Stars and Stripes.
   ``We remain neutral in the war,'' Armacost said. ``Objectively,
in some ways, there may be the appearance of a tilt, but it's a
tilt toward peace, not toward Iraq. The fact of the matter is that
there is a resolution in the U.N. that calls for a comprehensive
cease-fire.
   ``Our view ... is that neither country can win the war. The
question is whether they will muster the will to end it.''
   Armacost and Walters said they did not take at face value
declarations by some Iranian leaders that they would not seek
revenge for the deaths of the 290 passengers.
   ``We can't afford to let our guard down and we have `upped' our
security alert in the areas,'' Armacost said.
   Walters said ``the Iranian government is composed of extremely
unpredictable people and it's very difficult to say they will or
will not do anything.''

<TEXT>
   The state's method of electing state
district judges was challenged today in a federal lawsuit that
charges the at-large system makes it more difficult for
Mexican-Americans and blacks to be elected.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Midland by three
groups on behalf of the League of United Latin American Citizens
and local citizens, focuses on approximately 20 counties, said
Rolando L. Rios, an attorney.
   ``If judges are to be elected, then all members of the
electorate should have a fair and equal chance to elect judges of
their choice,'' said Domingo Garcia, chairman of the Texas Rural
Legal Foundation.
   The foundation was joined by the Southwest Voter Registration
Education Project and Texas Rural Legal Aid in filing the suit.
   Counties named as examples in the lawsuit included Harris,
Dallas, Ector, McClennan, Tarrant, Midland, Travis, Jefferson,
Galveston, Lubbock, Fort Bend, Smith, Brazos, Brazoria, Taylor,
Wichita, Angelina, Gregg and Bell.
   According to the suit, those counties contain 190 state judicial
districts and a combined minority population of nearly 30 percent,
but only 10 of the judges _ 5.3 percent _ are minorities.
   ``The number of minority judges sitting in those counties is
minuscule,'' said William L. Garrent, a Dallas lawyer.
   In the at-large system, all the judges in a county are elected
by the voters of the whole county. If a county is mostly white,
that makes it more difficult for a minority candidate to win.
   If the county is divided into districts, it's more likely that
minorities will make up a majority in at least one of the districts.
   The lawyers said many Texas counties have only a single state
district judge, and so were not named.
   Rios said that if the lawsuit is successful and single-member
districts are created, the number of minority judges in the
counties could increase from fewer than 20 to more than 110.

   Atlanta is a great place to live, but even the
residents acknowledge you wouldn't want to visit here.
   Nevertheless, Atlanta offers a handful of attractions to people
visiting the nation's third-busiest convention city: Braves
baseball games, a shopping spree at Saks, a trip to the gigantic
Six Flags Over Georgia amusement park and maybe an evening spent at
nearby Stone Mountain Park watching a laser light show on the side
of the world's largest outcropping of granite.
   The 35,000 folks in town for the Democratic National Convention
next week won't be able to do two of those: the Braves are in
Philadelphia and New York all week, while the laser show takes
place at night when the convention sessions occur.
   On the other hand, there is an eclectic assortment of dining
available: The telephone listings run for 28 pages from A Kenneth
Melear Barbecue No. 1 and A Taste of New Orleans to Zorba's Corner
and Zorba's Gyro.
   In two hotels _ the Westin Peachtree Plaza and Hyatt Regency _
delegates can have drinks and dinner in a revolving restaurant,
watching the city spin below.
   Convention organizers, however, have warned restaurant owners
not to expect too much business from the Democrats, unless the
businessmen are willing to stay open much later than usual to
accommodate delegates after the long evening sessions.
   Other places to visit in Atlanta include:
   _ The High Museum of Art, a 130,000-square-foot museum with a
permanent collection that includes European and American paintings
and sculpture and West African sculpture and decorative arts.
   _ The Jimmy Carter Library, which includes a replica of the Oval
Office and Carter's presidential memorabilia.
   _ The Martin Luther King Jr. Center For Nonviolent Social
Change, adjacent to Ebenezer Baptist Church, the civil rights
leader's base, and a block away from his birthplace. King's tomb is
at the center, which also features a display of memorabilia.
   _ Zoo Atlanta, a newly renovated attraction. It recently
unveiled the Ford African Rain Forest featuring the city's famous
gorilla, Willie B.
   _ Cyclorama, next to the zoo, which features a 100-year-old
painting depicting the Civil War Battle of Atlanta. Spectators sit
in a revolving platform while listening to a narrative of the
battle.
   _ Fernbank Science Center, one of the nation's largest
planetariums with regularly scheduled programs.
   _ Fox Theatre, built in 1920 as an open courtyard in a Moorish
city. Now a national landmark, a renovation was recently completed
and tours are available, although the building is a working theater
and concert hall.

<HEAD>Ancient Sculptures Arrive At Emory, First Trip Outside Italy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN S. CARLSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Photographs'' from antiquity of a Roman
empress, Hadrian's lover Antinous and various slaves and private
citizens go on exhibit Thursday on their first trip outside Italy.
   The 19 marble portrait sculptures from imperial Rome are from
the vast collection of the Roman National Museum, which agreed to
loan them for an exhibit by the Emory University Museum of Art and
Archaeology.
   Emory financed the packing, shipping and publication of a
catalog co-written by Maxwell Anderson, director of the Emory
museum, and Leila Nista, inspector of archaeology for the Roman
museum. Following an international symposium next January on
private portraiture in the Roman world, the busts return to Italy
for their first exhibit at the Roman National Museum.
   The current exhibit of Roman portraiture will remain at Emory
until Jan. 3. ``It's here for the longest period of time allowed by
Italian law to the day _ six months,'' said Anderson, who was a
visiting professor at the University of Rome last year.
   The wealth of information about the original location, function
and method of display for most of the busts ``furnish invaluable
evidence about the uses of portraiture in antiquity,'' Anderson
said.
   Romans from most economic classes could afford life-sized
sculptured heads of themselves and it was customary for slaves to
commission their portraits when they were freed, he said. After
subjects died, their sculptures usually were buried along with
their remains or were placed on display in a gallery in the home of
their descendants.
   Among the marble busts are an elegant woman and an older,
melancholy man, fashioned around the time of Nero in the first
century, A.D.
   ``These were slaves of the first imperial family of Rome,'' said
Anderson.
   They found in an underground tomb just outside the city walls in
1847, but have never been displayed until now, Anderson said.
   Also on exhibit is a bust of the Empress Faustina Minor found in
the late 1800s in the Roman Forum's House of the Vestal Virgins.
This mother of 13 children by Emperor Marcus Aurelius apparently
was honored with a portrait display for lending her support to a
renovation of the temple, Anderson said.
   The bust of Antinous was found in 1869 in the sanctuary of the
Earth mother goddess Magna Mater at Ostia, a seaport colony for
which Hadrian served as benefactor, according to the exhibit
catalog.

   President Daniel arap Moi wants Kenya to
scrap a policy that forbids the nation's high schools to teach
William Shakespeare's plays, the Kenya Times reported Monday.
   The plays were dropped from school courses in 1981 in what an
official report said was a move to get rid of ``the colonial
hangover in independent Kenya,'' which gained independence from
Britain in 1963.
   Moi on Sunday urged the Education Ministry to change its policy,
saying he regarded the British writer as ``an international
figure.''
   ``The Ministry of Education dropped Shakespeare thinking it is
colonial. But I do not see why it should not be part of our
syllabus in secondary schools,'' Moi was quoted as saying in a
speech.

<HEAD>Pope John Paul II Stamp Cancellation Suit Ruled Moot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's no point in deciding whether special
stamp cancellations during Pope John Paul II's visit violated the
separation of church and state, a federal appeals court ruled
Monday.
   ``Because the pope's 1987 visit is history and no other visits
are planned, the appellants can escape mootness only by showing
that the Postal Service's action is `capable of repetition, yet
evading review,''' the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said.
   The ruling upheld a decision in Texas against a suit filed by
Ralph B. Shirley and the Society of Separationists Inc. against the
San Antonio postmaster.
   The lawsuit was filed Aug. 25, 1987, about a month after the
U.S. Postal Service announced plans for special hand cancellations
of stamps at stations in each of the nine cities the pope was to
visit in September.
   It claimed the cancellations marked a religious event, thereby
supporting Roman Catholicism in violation of the First Amendment to
the Constitution.
   The district court denied the request for an injunction, saying
that only about 10,000 stamps _ one-tenth of one percent of the
mail processed that day _ were likely to get the papal cancellation
on Sept. 13 in San Antonio.
   In January, the court ruled the question moot, so hypothetical
that it was meaningless to rule on.
   Shirley and the separationists appealed. The Postal Service had
honored the pope with stamp cancellations in 1979, 1981, twice in
1984, and in 1987, and was likely to do so again because the pope
was likely to visit this country again, they said.
   The court disagreed.

<HEAD>Colleges Use Increasingly Sophisticated Means of Fund-Raising</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colleges are growing increasingly
sophisticated in their fund-raising among alumni, turning to
computers and, in some cases, using researchers to comb tax forms,
land-holding records and divorce decrees to separate the haves from
the have-nots.
   The University of Michigan added nearly 24,628 names to its list
of potential major donors by asking a quarter-million alumni to
fill out a detailed census.
   Michigan, which raised $62 million last year and garnered $173
million in a multi-year ``Campaign for Michigan,'' consulted with a
sociologist and behavioral psychologist in framing its four-page
questionnaire in 1986.
   The Michigan grads were asked not only their job and
biographical data, but their personal and household income, how
they felt about their alma mater, and whether they were sending
their children to Ann Arbor.
   ``We didn't say it was or it wasn't'' going to be used to gauge
their capacity to give, said Margaret Fisher, a Michigan
development office worker. Nearly 115,000 alumni responded, and 86
percent gave their income.
   The university ranked the potential major donors in 24
categories and also identified what another Michigan development
officer calls ``persistent non-donors'' who may be dropped from
future solicitations.
   Fund-raising is big business for colleges and universities. Some
employ specialists by the score whose full-time job is to convince
people to unleash their charitable instinct.
   Sixty-five campuses have embarked on drives to raise more than
$100 million apiece. Washington University in St. Louis recently
wrapped up a campaign with a record $607 million in hand, and
Stanford University has passed the halfway mark in a $1.1 billion
drive launched last year.
   The stock market collapse last October made the going tougher,
but it has not derailed any of the major drives.
   Stanford, which took in $198 million last year alone, is ``a
little bit behind in gifts this year _ 14 or 15 percent _ compared
to last year, but so is everybody else,'' said David Fulton,
director of communications for the university's development office.
   Not all the information on wealthy prospects comes from alumni
themselves.
   Many campus development offices _ as the fund-raising operations
are called _ have researchers combing public records for clues on
whom to approach. Some hire commercial firms to do their
prospecting.
   ``Once confined to consulting dusty alumni files, research on
donors today can include checks of land holdings, court records of
estate and divorce proceedings, stock proxies, tax forms and
memberships in clubs and on corporate boards,'' the Chronicle of
Higher Education noted in its June 22 issue.
   ``In fact, college researchers who study donors are so much like
detectives that they even refer to potential contributors as
`suspects,''' the Chronicle reported.
   Sometimes, it added, ``they step on a few toes,'' as when one
landowner was outraged to learn from a county clerk that a college
researcher was probing into the size of his holdings.
   Kathleen Foley, who checks prospects for Carleton College, told
the Chronicle that to remain unobtrusive, some researchers send
requests for information on plain white stationery and have the
responses sent to their home addresses.
   According to Gerlinda S. Melchiori, the University of Michigan's
deputy director of administrative services for development and
communications, alumni surveys can yield ``what every fund-raiser
dreams of: an in-house prospect ranking system.''
   Writing in the July-August issue of Currents, a magazine
published by the Council for Advancement and Support of Education,
Melchiori said Michigan used profiles of 2,800 known major donors
to prepare the list of 24,628 new prospects _ ``more than members
of our major gift staff have time to pursue,'' Melchiori noted.
   The rankings, she said, ``help us determine who deserves
additional prospect research and who warrants immediate follow-up.''
   The same computer techniques can be used to figure out who isn't
likely to respond to the pitch.
   ``We're now analyzing our so-called persistent non-donors. We
can identify alumni who share their characteristics and thus must
likely would not be responsive to mail solicitation. We will then
be able to drop people in those groups from our annual mailings,''
Melchiori wrote.
   Fisher emphasized, ``We're not releasing any information on
individuals to anyone outside the university.''

   A helicopter landed in a state prison
recreation yard today, picked up two inmates and made a daring
getaway under fire from guards, corrections officials said.
   The prison was immediately locked down and a head count was
under way to determine who had escaped, said Don Caviness, a
spokesman for the New Mexico Corrections Department.
   Department of Public Safety spokesman Dan Taylor said the brown
and beige helicopter apparently flew into the area at a low
altitude about 9:40 a.m.
   The chopper picked up two inmates and took off, flying away at
low altitude as corrections officers blazed away. Taylor said New
Mexico National Guard and U.S. Customs Service helicopters have
taken to the air searching for the craft.
   The Penitentiary of New Mexico, 12 miles southwest of here,
activated its emergency notification system to the press and nearby
residents, informing them of the escape.

   Despite temperatures in the 90s, a 1910
Stanley Steamer showed its mettle by puffing up Dead Horse Hill in
record time in a recreation of a race that was an early proving
ground for motorized horsepower.
   Sue Keith of McClean, Va., guided her 78-year-old steamer up the
mile-long incline in 45 seconds Sunday to eclipse the 54-second
mark established by L.F.N. Baldwin in his Stanley Racing Car in
1909.
   From 1905 until 1911, the climb sponsored by the Worcester
Automobile Club was one of new automobile industry's major tests,
annually attracting more than 10,000 spectators.
   The race was first recreated in 1985 by a company celebrating
its centennial, and this year three other 100-year-old companies
joined in staging it.
   The event attracted 56 antique autos. One of the slowest took
eight minutes to climb the hill, but most managed in about three
minutes.
   ``It's an event I'm glad to see re-enacted,'' said Peter Morgan
of Morgan Construction, one of the sponsors. ``It's fun to go up
the hill and be cheered at every crest.''

   You can win for losing after all if you bought a

number 9696.
   The actual winning number was 9690. But the number 9696 was
written down by a lottery employee to be read during a live
television broadcast of lottery numbers.
   Holders of tickets bearing both numbers will receive prizes,
officials said.
   ``Although the correct Daily-4 numbers were furnished to news
media and the retail ticket outlets, lottery officials have vowed
to pay on both numbers rather than disappoint players who would
have won with the number that was announced,'' Lottery Commissioner
Michael Carr said in a statement.
   Payouts on either number will range from $104 to $5,000,
depending on the order in which they were played, said Jack
Schaffer, Carr's chief deputy. Daily-4 tickets cost $1.

   Breakdancing? That's old. If you want to be cool
in Beijing this summer, pool is the game.
   Pool tables have appeared on sidewalks all over the city in a
craze that participants attribute to television coverage of a
recent international pool tournament in Beijing.
   Never mind that many of the tables tilt or rock slightly because
of uneven sidewalks, or that the players miss shots more often than
not.
   ``It's fun, and there isn't much else to do,'' said a young man
watching a game on a recent Sunday evening.
   Twelve tables were set up along one city block alone, most
surrounded by young workers drinking soda and _ according to one
youth _ placing bets, although no money changed hands openly.
   ``That's why some of them like to play,'' the youth said. ``They
don't bet much, just one or two yuan (27 to 54 cents).''
   In a city where most residents flee their tiny, hot apartments
on summer evenings and mahjong and card games are the only
diversions, pool is a welcome discovery. The tables are set up
outdoors because few people have the space inside.
   Shen Li, a driver who works for a textile factory near Beijing,
owns one of the tables. He keeps it disassembled in his one-room
apartment most of the time and sets it up on bricks on the sidewalk
at night and on weekends.
   ``Some friends and I got together and bought it to amuse
ourselves,'' said Shen, a burly man whose pot belly spills out of
his open cotton shirt and over his belt. ``If other people want to
play they pay 1 yuan (27 cents) per game. My friends don't pay,''
he said.
   Game after game was played without anyone paying. ``They're all
my friends,'' Shen said, waving his arm at the crowd of several
dozen onlookers.
   He hasn't yet recouped his $108 investment in the table, but he
isn't worried. ``It's just for fun,'' he said.
   Down the street, a man who identified himself as Li was less
generous.
   ``The table cost me 350 yuan ($95),'' said Li, a skinny man in
his 20s with dirty feet in plastic sandals. ``I get about 20 yuan
(about $5) a day. It's not enough.''
   ``Change your money?'' he asked, revealing the real source of
his earnings _changing currency on the black market.
   Pool is still too new a sport for professional ``sharks'' to
have emerged. Competition is friendly and low-key.
   ``Everyone lives in the neighborhood and we all know each
other,'' said one bystander. ``Who's the best player? There are a
few _ not me.''
   Most of the players seemed vague when asked about the rules of
the game. ``There aren't really any rules,'' said Shen.
   ``It's just like you play in the United States,'' said his
friend, Zhang Chunsheng, whose spread-eagle shooting style won him
two games. Li said he and his friends learned from watching
television.
   Breakdancing _ translated in Chinese as ``thunderbolt dancing''
_ also became a fad in Beijing this spring after the American movie
of that name was shown in theaters.
   One pool fan said he thought private circulation of the American
film ``The Color of Money,'' with Paul Newman as an aging pool
shark, helped boost the game's popularity.
   ``It's a great movie,'' the youth said.
   But police are not keen on the new sport. In some neighborhoods,
they periodically interrupt play and order the tables off the
sidewalks, saying they block traffic.
   ``That hasn't happened here,'' Shen said. ``This is a small
street, not much activity. They don't interfere with us.''

   Voting ended Monday on the A.H. Robins Co.
reorganization plan, which specifies that the maker of the Dalkon
Shield intrauterine birth control device would be purchased by
American Home Products Corp. of New York.
   Stockholders, creditors and claimants in Dalkon Shield
litigation faced a 5 p.m. deadline for delivering ballots to
Corporation Trust Co., a Wilmington, Del., firm hired by Robins to
tabulate the results.
   Robins was forced to file for protection under Chapter 11 of
federal bankruptcy law in 1985 after thousands of women sued the
company, saying they were injured by the Dalkon Shield.
   Under the reorganization plan, Dalkon Shield claimants would
share from a trust of $2.31 billion to $2.735 billion. Also,
Robins' creditors would be paid in full, and stockholders would
receive $29 per share of their Robins stock.
   The results of the vote will be released at Monday's hearing in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Robins spokesman John Taylor said.

step in the process of U.S.-Polish re-engagement.''
   In Warsaw, Olechowski told the state-run news agency PAP that
``an official visit of the Polish Foreign Minister is surely a
significant development in this normalization.''
   Olechowski replaced Marian Orzechowski as foreign minister in
mid-June following a plenum of the Communist Party.
   Mrs. Oakley said Olechowski will meet with Secretary of State
George P. Shultz and other senior administration officials.
   Polish-American relations have improved markedly over the past
year and a half after an extended period of hostile ties that
followed the imposition of martial law by Polish authorities in
1981.

   A section of the Brenner highway that links
Italy to Austria will be closed for two hours Tuesday so
authorities can defuse a World War II bomb, the Italian news agency
ANSA said.
   The agency said the bomb was discovered during construction of
the northern highway exit for Trento, 365 miles north of Rome.
   While the bomb is being defused, authorities will close a
nine-mile stretch of the motorway between the Trento north and the
San Michele all'Adige exits for two hours beginning at 10:30 a.m.
Tuesday.

   A peach pit and barber tools were among
the items found in a 100-year-old time capsule from the cornerstone
of the Benton County Courthouse.
   The capsule was opened Saturday as part of ceremonies
rededicating the building.
   Secretary of State Barbara Roberts pried the lid open, then
helped State Archivist Layne Sawyer removed the contents as County
Commissioner Dale Schrock broadcast the discovery to a crowd of
about 300 people.
   Besides the pit, the officials found tools from Jesse Spencer's
Barbershop and Bathing Salon, a pewter and silver teapot, and
several coins, including an 1871 Indian head penny, an 1888 nickel,
an 1876 dime and an 1854 half-penny.
   Also in the capsule were a leather-bound copy of The General
Laws of Oregon and newspapers, including a July 4, 1888, copy of
the Morning Oregonian.
   A new capsule with 1988 items is to be placed in the cornerstone
this fall.

<HEAD>Meese Comments On Newspaper Story About Sealed Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III complained
Monday that ``it's not only illegal, it's unfair'' that someone
leaked portions of an independent counsel's report on his
activities.
   The New York Times published a story Saturday that said portions
of the report, by independent counsel James McKay, show Meese gave
differing accounts of his knowledge about a possible bribery scheme
involving a $1 billion Iraqi pipeline project.
   Meese, in St. Louis for an FBI gathering, denied he gave
differing accounts.
   Asked Monday if he knew the details in 1985 of plans to pay the
Israeli Labor Party money from the pipeline project, Meese replied:
``No, I have no recollection of knowing anything about that.''
   Meese said he did not read closely a memo from his longtime
friend, E. Robert Wallach, in September 1985 mentioning the planned
payments to the political party.
   ``The first time I focused on that, as I made clear to the
independent counsel when they showed me the memorandum during the
course of depositions, (was) in ... November of 1987,'' Meese said.
   McKay submitted his report July 5 under seal to a federal
appeals court panel in Washington. The report is to be released
publicly in a few weeks, after people named in it have had an
opportunity to file responses.
   Meese said the leaked portions of the report showed only ``one
side of the picture.''
   ``Under the law, there's also supposed to be a response filed by
my lawyers or anyone else who might be mentioned in the report,''
he said. ``So it's not only illegal, it's unfair to only have half
the picture out. The public's entitled to the whole picture, all
sides which should be made public when the report is released
lawfully by the court.''
   Meese, who spoke briefly to reporters after giving an address
that was closed to the media, was asked about his belief that he
had been vindicated.
   ``I have only been talking about the fact that that vindication
comes from one decision that the independent counsel is required to
make,'' Meese said. ``He's only required to find out if there's
been any justification to going forward. And the decision he makes
is whether he should proceed with criminal action.
   ``And in this case, he has indicated that after a thorough and
exhaustive investigation he has determined not to take criminal
action and that's the vindication I've talked about.''
   Meese said he did not believe his actions in the case were open
to any questions of ethics, adding that ``if any issues are raised,
I'm prepared to answer them because I've been totally ethical and
proper as well as lawful in my conduct at all times.''

<HEAD>Northwest Indians Reject Record Offer of Land, Cash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAY RIVER RESERVE, Northwest Territories (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of
15,000 native Indians in Canada's Northwest Territories have
rejected a land claim offer from the federal government.
   All but four of the 300 delegates to a special joint assembly
voted Sunday to reject the offer of $500 million ($415 million
U.S.) in cash and the use of 72,000 square miles of land in the
Mackenzie River region.
   Leaders of the Dene Indians and the northern Metis _ who are
half-descended from French fur traders _ called for more
negotiations with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, setting a two-year
deadline for agreement.
   About 1,000 Indians gathered for a week at Hay River Indian
reservation for the heated debate over whether to accept a
tentative agreement reached in May after protracted negotiations.
   Some bands wanted to sign the agreement because of the toll
taken by poverty, alcoholism and other chronic problems on Indian
settlements.
   But other groups demanded a broader agreement including
provisions for self-government and clear title to their ancestral
land. In the end, there were only three dissenting votes and one
abstention.
   Georges Erasmus, president of the Assembly of First Nations
which represents all Canadian Indians, urged Dene leaders not to
``nail themselves to the cross'' of the federal offer. Anyone too
tired to continue fighting for their rights should step down, he
said.
   The assembly called for a meeting with Mulroney and Indian
Affairs Minister Bill McKnight to renegotiate areas such as
self-government, aboriginal title, taxation and water rights.
   In a letter to the Dene and Metis last week, McKnight termed the
deal the government's last offer and demanded a decision by July
15. He warned that Ottawa may not be willing to reopen negotiations.
   The Snare Lakes Indian band leader, Alexis Arrowmaker, said he
is willing to take that chance. ``We are powerful, we're strong
enough to talk to any government.''
   The Dene live below the timber line in a wintry region rich in
fish, game and mineral resources. Many follow a traditional way of
life by trapping for furs and hunting caribou.
   The original Dene and Meti negotiators of the land claim said
ownership of 72,000 square miles _ an area larger than North Dakota
_ would have made their people the largest private landholders in
North America.
   The government would have retained oil and mineral rights
underneath most of it, but the Indians were offered subsurface
rights for 3,200 square miles.
   In addition, the government promised continued hunting, trapping
and fishing rights on another 480,000 square miles of Crown land,
stretching from the borders of Alberta and Saskatchewan to above
the Arctic Circle.

<HEAD>Soviet Paintings from Time of Revolution Go on Display in
Washington</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An exhibit of Soviet paintings, many hidden
for years by order of Communist Party leaders, will go on display
in Washington on Tuesday in a new show of Soviet openness.
   The show, called ``Russian and Soviet Paintings, 1900-1930,''
will be at the Hirshhorn Museum and is considered the first one of
significance devoted to works from just before and just after the
1917 Russian revolution.
   The exhibit of works on loan from Moscow and Leningrad will
continue until Sept. 25. Unlike many major art exhibits, it will
not be shown in any other U.S. city.
   Included are works by Marc Chagall and Vasilii Kandinsky, who
are among the best-known artists of the 20th century. Both were
born in Russia and died in exile.
   Chagall was appointed commissar of art for the Vitebsk region in
1918, but became disillusioned with the young Soviet state in 1922
and moved moved to Paris. He returned to Moscow only for a visit
shortly before his death in 1985.
   Kandinsky helped reorganize Russian museums after the
revolution. He taught in Germany from 1923 to 1933 and moved to
Paris when the Nazis came to power in Germany. He died in Paris in
1944.
   Both Chagall and Kandinsky were part of the ``avant-garde,'' or
vanguard, movement in Russia, which aroused universal interest in
the early part of the century. Soviet leaders favored or tolerated
it at first, but later suppressed it in favor of ``Socialist
realism,'' which supported their political aims.
   ``Many avant-garde artists feverishly welcomed the revolution,
equating such revolutionary change with unfettered creativity and
free experimentation in form,'' the exhibition's catalog says.
   Artists in the movement ``fell into the shadows'' in the early
1930s, Stanislav Ivanitsky, director of Soviet painting at the
State Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow, said at a news conference in
Washington on Monday. ``It was about 10 or 15 years ago that they
started coming out.''
   Under leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviets have been
increasingly open in their political and artistic expression.
   Next March, the Soviets will see their first show devoted to the
work of Kandinsky. Talks about it are now in progress with the
Guggenheim Museum in New York, Ivanitsky said.
   Also under discussion is an exhibit of American painting to be
shown in the Soviet Union in exchange for the present one in
Washington.

<HEAD>US Negotiator Says No `Star Wars' Link for Strategic Arms Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY CZUCZKA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States will not limit its plans for
space-based defense as a condition for a strategic nuclear arms
treaty, Washington's chief negotiator said Monday on the eve of new
U.S.-Soviet arms talks.
   Max Kampelmen also dismissed Soviet calls for a new formal
commitment by both sides to the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty,
which restricts each country to a missile defense around one site.
He said negotiators have yet to agree on a text pledging both sides
to observe the pact for a certain period.
   Negotiatons on a treaty to reduce strategic, or long-range,
nuclear arms began in March 1985 and enter their 10th round with a
plenary meeting Tuesday. They recessed before the May 29-June 2
summit in Moscow between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   Neither side has announced an ending date for this round, at
which Kampelman said negotiators will try to complete a draft
treaty cutting strategic arsenals in half.
   He said in a statement to reporters that the draft treaty
includes ``many key provisions that are completely agreed ... but
much that is important still remains to be resolved.''
   Kampelman and Soviet chief delegate Alexei Obukhov had lunch
together Monday and discussed issues of ``substance,'' Kampelman
said, but would not elaborate. In response to questions from
journalists, he said they should not expect rapid progress.
   Negotiators probably will work ``carefully,'' and not be
watching the calendar, he said, adding: ``Don't look for drama.
We're at a stage now where hard work is required rather than
drama.''
   The chief U.S. delegate said he hopes this round will at least
``significantly narrow the differences,'' and expressed the belief
a treaty can be completed before Reagan leaves office in January.
The superpowers signed a treaty in December to destroy their
intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
   Obukhov said when he arrived Sunday that the talks should not be
allowed to lose momentum.
   Both sides agree the treaty should reduce their long-range
arsenals over seven years to an overall limit of 6,000 warheads and
1,600 launchers, such as intercontinental missiles and heavy
bombers.
   A principal argument is over limiting nuclear-tipped cruise
missiles on warships. On Saturday, Obukhov linked progress at the
talks to resolving that issue.
   The United States rejected a Soviet proposal for inspectors to
be allowed aboard ships, and says no other satisfactory
verification methods have been found. The sides have agreed not to
include the ship-launched missiles in the 6,000-warhead ceiling.
   A long-standing problem in negotiations on reducing strategic
arms is the Soviet demand that they be linked to limits on the U.S.
effort to develop a space-based defense system _ the Strategic
Defense Initiative, commonly called ``Star Wars.''
   ``We reject Soviet attempts to use these negotiations to have us
end our Strategic Defense Initiative,'' Kampleman said.
   Kampelman mentioned these other major areas of disagreement:
   _The U.S. desire for limits on each kind of intercontinental
ballistic missiles within the overall limit of 6,000.
   _How to count air-launched cruise missiles and keep track of
mobile missiles.
   _``Scores of questions'' on verification.
   Related understandings reached at the Moscow summit included
counting all existing long-range, air-launched cruise missiles and
distinguishing between bombers that carry them and those that do
not.
   On mobile missiles, the sides agreed to restrict them to
designated territories as a means of making the count simpler. The
size of the areas was not determined.

   A helicopter plucked two convicted
murderers and a thief from a state prison yard under fire from
guards today, but the chopper was forced down and those aboard were
captured after an 80-mile aerial chase, officials said.
   The helicopter flew into the Penitentiary of New Mexico about
9:50 a.m. and picked up the three inmates, said Don Caviness, a
spokesman for the New Mexico Corrections Department.
   It flew to Mid-Valley Airport in Los Lunas, about 80 miles south
of here, where it was met by three state police officers, Caviness
said.
   Two of the inmates got out of the helicopter, and one of them
was wounded and captured in a gun battle, according to Ronni Crago,
spokeswoman for the Bernalillo County sheriff's department. The
helicopter took off again and the other inmate fled into on foot
and was being hunted, Crago said.
   The chopper was then chased across the Albuquerque area by a
U.S. Customs Service helicopter and other aircraft and forced down
at Albuquerque International Airport. Two people were taken into
custody at the airport, authorities said.
   Caviness said about 100 inmates were in the prison recreation
yard at the time of the escape. He said guards opened fire from two
towers, but he didn't know if the helicopter was hit.
   The penitentiary was immediately locked down and a head count
was taken to determine who escaped, Caviness said.
   Caviness, when asked whether today's type of escape ever was
envisioned, said: ``This is beyond what we had planned for.''
   The inmates were identified as Daniel Mahoney, 30, serving life
plus 60 years for second-degree murder and armed robbery in
Florida; Francis Preston Mitchell, 26, serving life for
first-degree murder in Utah; and Randy Mack Lackey, 19, of Curry
County, N.M., serving a nine year sentence for larceny.
   Mahoney and Mitchell were being held under an interstate compact
that provides for exchange of prisoners. Caviness said Lackey was a
helicopter pilot and was wounded in the gun battle at Los Lunas.
   In a previous helicopter escape in November 1986, a woman
serving time for bank robbery was snatched from the yard of a
federal prison at Dublin, Calif., by her lover. The couple were
caught 10 days later in a shopping mall while picking up a set of
wedding rings.
   The escape prompted federal prison officials around the country
to build ``chopper stoppers,'' massive wire grids covering prison
yards and other open areas. About 20 of 47 federal prisons had such
barriers in place or under construction by the end of 1986, the
federal Bureau of Prisons said.
   In December 1987, two prisoners fled a maximum-security in
Britain's first helicopter escape. The helicopter had been
chartered to fly over a golf course, then the pilot was forced at
gunpoint to land at the prison.
   In July 1987, a man awaiting trial for bank robbery escaped from
prison in Nice, France, by grabbing onto a rope dangling from a
helicopter. He and an accomplice were captured because some
children thought they were seeing a movie being filmed and followed
the men to their hideout.
   The New Mexico prison suffered one of the most deadly riots in
U.S. prison history when 33 inmates were killed by fellow prisoners
on Feb. 2-3, 1980.
   The prison suffered a mass escape on July 4, 1987, when seven
prisoners broke out. All were eventually recaptured.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's military chief of staff
announced Monday an agreement designed to ease superpower friction
through creation of a ``military-to-military working group,'' but
said the Red Army plans no unilateral withdrawal from Central
Europe.
   Ending a weeklong tour of the United States, Marshal Sergei
Akhromeyev met with President Reagan at the White House before
unveiling the agreement at the Pentagon with the chairman of the
U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William Crowe.
   Along with creation of the joint working group, designed to head
off brushfire incidents between the two sides, the two officials
also announced future tour exchanges among top commanders and
several other steps designed to enhance mutual understanding,
including port visits by warships.
   Akhromeyev and Crowe, flanked by their national flags, were in a
jovial mood, and gingerly handled questions that each might have
exploited to stress their disagreements.
   ``We do have some differences,'' acknowledged Crowe.
``Obviously, we did not try to paper those over.''
   ``But I also think that we clarified our perspectives. We
probably cleared up some misunderstandings, and I think we formed
the basis for further exploration,'' said the American admiral.
   Akhromeyev generously thanked Crowe for taking him on the U.S.
tour, unprecedented for such a high-ranking official of the Soviet
Defense Ministry, where he is No. 2 man next to Defense Minister
Dmitri Yazov. The visit included a cruise aboard an aircraft
carrier at sea, a peek inside a B-1 bomber, a visit to a missile
training facility, a rodeo, a barbeque, the gift of an Indian
headdress, and a trip to Crowe's alma mater, the University of
Oklahoma.
   At the news conference, the two announced agreement to form a
joint ``military to military working group ... to explore the issue
of dangerous military activity in greater detail and make
recommendations.''
   Examples of the sort of friction the group will attempt to
resolve in the future include the fatal shooting by Soviet soldiers
of U.S. Maj. Arthur Nicholson in East Germany in 1985, and the
bumping incident involving U.S. and Soviet ships in the Black Sea
last Feb. 12.
   To stimulate long-range contact, Crowe and Akhromeyev also laid
out a two-year exchange program beginning this fall with a meeting
between senior U.S. and Soviet commanders in Central Europe.
   Also on the agenda are a return visit to the Soviet Union by
Crowe in the summer of 1989, port visits by warships, and tour
exchanges of doctors, historians, the commanders of the services,
and a marksmanship competition.
   Despite the comraderie, Akhromeyev apparently made little
progress convincing Crowe the heavily publicized Soviet ``doctrine
of defensive sufficiency'' has reduced the threat posed by Warsaw
Pact forces. Akhromeyev said ``in the past Soviet military doctrine
allowed for both offensive and defensive military operations. Now,
we are introducing some changes in order to make the military
doctrine purely defensive in character.''
   ``Of course, we realized that our methods of troop training were
a matter of concern, especially in European countries,'' he said,
speaking in Russian.
   ``In accordance with the new defensive doctrine, we are
beginning to introduce some changes in the organizational structure
of the Soviet armed forces, in order to impart a defensive nature
to the armed forces, but this will demand some time,'' he said.
   ``The complete realization of the changes ... bears on bilateral
steps. Therefore, we must sit at the negotiating table and address
the outstanding issues between us,'' he said, meaning that the
Kremlin expects the West to make simultaneous cuts.
   Akhromeyev brushed aside U.S. intelligence reports that some Red
Army units might be pulled out of Hungary, repeating an earlier
declaration there would be no unilateral withdrawals from Eastern
Europe.
   Crowe carefully avoided repeating his past skepticism of the new
Soviet doctine, saying only that in his conversations with
Akhromeyev ``I expressed some of our concerns and reservations, and
the marshal told me to keep watching and to watch very closely. And
I intend to do that.''
   Akhromeyev told him to watch ``exercises, deployments,
structuring of units,'' Crowe said.
   ``The most significant aspect of Marshal Akhromeyev's visit ...
is the opportunity he has had in the last days to take the measure
of the people who operate that equipment, young men and women who
love their country and their way of life,'' Crowe.
   Akhromeyev thanked Crowe for ``taking his time to educate me in
many ways. He was telling me how the American nation was
developed.''
   ``He told me how the American mind became how it is, and I have
never read anything like that in any books,'' the Soviet marshal
said, drawing laughter from the military officers and reporters in
the room.
   The Soviet marshal said he had been especially impressed with
the roads which criss-cross the American Great Plains at one mile
intervals, and said that his nation was trying to improve its rural
transportion system to make sure that more food gets from the field
to the table.

   Hundreds of residents of this coastal town
showed up to help search a beach where a missing teen-ager's
bicycle was found hidden in the brush.
   Within days, state police concluded that 15-year-old Dorene
Raterman had been killed at Del Ray Beach, just a half-mile from
her home, and then two men were arrested in connection with her
death.
   But Dorene's body has not been found. And that leaves the case
resting largely on the testimony of one of the men under arrest,
described as slightly retarded, who says the other one admitted
killing the girl. The second man denies it.
   And as frustration and anger grow, there's been talk in town of
vigilantism.
   ``My son works in a plywood mill and he says that's all they
talk about,'' said Jon G. Blissett, operator of the Gearhart
Chevron station for 26 years. ``There's a lot of people who would
like to get these two guys out of jail. They'd get them to talk.''
   For Judy and Jack Raterman, parents of five boys, waiting for
final word on their only daughter is a nightmare.
   ``It's the most helpless thing in the world,'' Mrs. Raterman
said in an interview. ``There's nothing anybody can do. It's like
being stabbed with a knife _ every day.''
   Dorene left a note to her parents on June 15, saying she would
return home soon from a bike ride to Del Ray Beach.
   ``The beach is something we all frequent,'' Mrs. Raterman said.
``It's just a very quiet, peaceful place. Normally it doesn't get a
lot of traffic like some of the other beaches do.''
   Police got their first major break in the case when a man
reported seeing a girl on a bicycle and two men in a gold MGB
sports car near the beach the evening of June 15.
   The description of the car led them to Tiac K. Eastman, 25, of
Astoria, son of a former county sheriff. Eastman admitted he and
Anthony P. Mullins, both dishwashers at a hotel in nearby Seaside,
had driven to the beach that night in Eastman's car to drink beer
and talk, according to a court affidavit.
   Eastman told police he and Mullins saw the girl, and Mullins
went to talk to her. He said he later heard a scream and that when
Mullins returned he told Eastman he had strangled the girl with a
small chain he carried to secure his wallet, the affidavit said.
   Although Eastman indicated several areas where the body might be
found, searches yielded nothing. He was indicted on a charge of
hindering prosecution for allegedly driving Mullins from the scene.
   The affidavit also said police seized blood-stained clothing and
a set of radio earphones from the apartment of Mullins' father in
Seaside. Mullins, 20, stayed there until he left for San Francisco,
where he was arrested June 29.
   The blood was the same type as Dorene's, and the Ratermans told
police they believed Dorene had her portable radio when she went to
the beach, the affidavit says.
   Mullins has said he's innocent, and an automatic innocent plea
was entered at his arraignment Monday. He was held without bail on
kidnapping and murder charges.
   Police won't speculate publicly on a motive.
   ``It wasn't a premeditated act. It was just a crime of
opportunity,'' said Ed Hauer Jr., coordinator of the Clatsop County
Search and Rescue Team.
   District Attorney Steve Gerttula won't speculate whether he has
enough evidence to convict Mullins.
   Without the body, the case appears to rest heavily on the
testimony of Eastman. If his testmony is thrown out of court,
Mullins could be set free, Gerttula said.
   That could put Mullins in greater trouble in the community.
   When Mullins was taken to court for arraignment last week, he
wore a bulletproof vest. When Eastman was arraigned, the hearing
was held in secret because the judge feared for Eastman's safety.

   The Interior Ministry today closed
down the Roman Catholic Church's radio station, accusing it of
``inciting to violence, disorder and lack of respect for
constitutional government.''
   Monsignor Bismarck Carballo, director of Radio Catolica, told
The Associated Press the order was ``unjust and arbitrary.''
   On Sunday, police used tear gas and beat protesters to break up
an anti-government demonstration by about 10,000 people. President
Daniel Ortega said the rally was part of a U.S. plan to destabilize
the leftist Sandinista government.
   An official in the Interior Ministry's press office, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said the radio station was ordered shut
down because of its broadcasts about the demonstration.
   Carballo said, however, ``all stations in the country reported
yesterday about those events.''
   ``What most concerns us that in our programming yesterday we
repeated a pastoral letter from the bishops issued June 29 and a
homily by Cardinal Miguel Obando in which `the right of the people
to civic protest' is defended,'' the monsignor said.
   Obando y Bravo, who has been a leading critic of the Sandinistas
in their nine years of rule, delivered his homily Sunday.
   Radio Catolica was closed by the government on Jan. 10, 1986. It
was allowed to reopen last September under the Central American
peace agreement signed by Ortega and the region's four other
presidents in August.
   Its news programs were closed for brief periods on June 2 and
June 10.
   Meanwhile, Miriam Arguello, leader of the opposition
Conservative Party, was detained by police during the night. The
Interior Ministry official said she was accused of being ``the
principal instigator of yesterday's events in Nandaime.''
   Sunday's anti-government rally, one of the largest ever in
Nicaragua, was held in Nandaime, a small city 40 miles south of
Managua.
   Ten police officers were injured and at least 38 people arrested
in the confrontation, the official Voice of Nicaragua said. It did
not say how many protesters were hurt.
   The opposition said three of its leaders were arrested.
   ``This is to show the people want democracy,'' protester Myriam
Arguello, secretary-general of the anti-government Conservative
Party, said just minutes before the demonstration turned into a
melee.
   Ortega told reporters afterward that his leftist government
would act ``with total firmness'' against protesters.
   ``We cannot continue being tolerant with those who want to take
advantage of the (political) space,'' he said, referring to recent
freedoms accorded anti-government groups in Nicaragua.
   He said the demonstration was part of a U.S. plan to destabilize
the government.
   Ortega made the comments after visiting the family of a
Sandinista Youth organization member authorities said was killed
Saturday when the car he was riding in was ambushed by U.S.-backed
Contra rebels.
   The violence began after protesters, some carrying signs that
read, ``Democracy Yes, Communism No,'' marched several blocks along
Nandaime's mud-covered streets to gather in an open field for
speeches.
   Scores of police with gas masks and AK-47 rifles stood guard
nearby.
   ``We're here to make sure that order is kept,'' an officer said.
   Witnesses said people began screaming and running for cover when
police began lobbing tear-gas canisters into the crowd.
   Groups of protesters hurled stones and sticks back at the
officers, and one man yelled: ``You murderous dogs!''
   Police beat several people with their fists, feet and rifle
butts. One man stood stunned, blood dripping down his face, his
arms cut.
   Witnesses said police threw one of the rally organizers, Carlos
Huembes, to the ground, then punched and kicked him.
   Plainclothes security agents confiscated film from several
photographers, including one from The Associated Press.
   Police used the tear gas after protesters began hurling rocks, a
state security officer told the AP.
   The demonstration was organized by the Democratic Coordinate, an
umbrella group for anti-government political parties and trade
organizations. It was authorized by the government, which staged
its own pro-Sandinista rally in the town over the weekend.
   Roger Guevara, secretary of the Coordinate, said in a statement
that Huembes and two other Coordinate members arrested at the rally
were being detained Sunday night. The statement identified them as
Agustin Jarquin Anaya and Adan Fletes of the Social Christian party.
   Public discontent with the Sandinistas has increased this year
as Nicaragua's economy worsens and the government's war against the
Contras remains unsettled.
   The government claims the Reagan administration, its last
request for renewed military aid to the Contras killed by Congress
in February, has been attempting to stir up discontent in Nicaragua.
   The Sandinista government was established in July 1979 after a
civil war toppled the rightist government of Anastasio Somoza.
   The U.S.-backed rebels have been fighting the government for
nearly seven years. But they signed a preliminary peace accord on
March 23 and have since held several rounds of talks aimed at
forging a lasting peace.
   A tenuous cease-fire remains in effect as the two sides
negotiate conditions for future talks.

   Former U.S. Rep. John Jenrette, a
recovering alcoholic, says helping an organization for children of
alcoholics is a way to repay his former district.
   Jenrette said he will be spokesman for the new John Jenrette
Center for the Children of Alcoholics, which was organized by some
of his associates.
   The center will focus on pre-teens and direct people to drug and
alcohol abuse programs. It will also sponsor a summer camp for
children who have an alcoholic parent.
   ``I've seen these children. They're generally neglected and
cannot communicate. They keep it inside and it comes out later.
It's a big undertaking but it could be of massive benefit,'' he
said.
   Jenrette, a Democrat, has said his own alcoholism contributed to
his involvement in the federal Abscam scandal. He was convicted in
1980 of conspiracy and accepting a bribe.
   Jenrette, who represented South Carolina's 6th District for six
years, lost his bid for re-election in 1980. In April, he scrapped
plans to try to reclaim the seat.

   Denise St. Aubyn Hubbard, 64, battled
equipment failures and went without food and sleep for the final 24
hours of her 34-day journey to become the oldest woman to sail
across the Atlantic Ocean alone.
   The Great Britain resident was the 70th sailor to finish the
Carlsberg Single-Handed Transatlantic Yacht Race when she arrived
in Newport on Saturday. Frenchman Philippe Poupon won the race with
a 10-day ocean crossing that ended June 15.
   Along the way, St. Aubyn Hubbard jury-rigged her automatic
steering equipment after the main and backup systems on her 42-foot
yacht failed, and hauled in yards of sodden canvas when an
automatic furling mechanism broke and a sail fell into the water.
   She managed without food and sleep in the final 24 hours to cope
with a failed navigational system.
   St. Aubyn Hubbard said she rejected the idea of heading for the
Azores for a stop after her troubles began.
   ``I'm not someone who likes going backward,'' she said. ``I had
a strong feeling that I would make it to this side.''
   A 1948 Olympic diver, St. Aubyn Hubbard was breaking world
women's swimming records at 14. She said she took up sailing in the
mid-1960s as a way to earn a living after her marriage broke up.

   Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and for
fashion photographer Francesco Scavullo, the six most beautiful
women on television are Nicollette Sheridan, Kim Alexis, Delta
Burke, Phylicia Rashad, Diane Sawyer and Courteney Cox.
   Scavullo's photos of his favorites, along with his reasons for
choosing them, appear in the July 16 issue of TV Guide.
   Ms. Sheridan, who appears on CBS' ``Knot's Landing,'' is ``a
great sunshine beauty,'' Scavullo said.
   Ms. Alexis of ABC's ``Good Morning America'' has been ``my
favorite cover girl for years and I'm glad to see her on television
as a fashion editor.''
   Ms. Burke, of CBS' ``Designing Women,'' frets about her weight,
he said. ``Two things she'll never have trouble with are her lovely
skin and eyes.''
   Scavullo first photographed Ms. Rashad, of NBC's ``The Cosby
Show,'' with her baby for Harper's Bazaar. ``She was quite
fabulous,'' he said.
   Diane Sawyer, of CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' ``is a great beauty and a
marvelous newscaster with an incredibly personal style,'' Scavullo
said.
   And Ms. Cox, who appears in NBC's ``Family Ties,'' caught
Scavullo's eye while dancing with Bruce Springsteen in a music
video. ``I don't know if she's Irish, but she has gorgeous Irish
eyes,'' Scavullo said.

   A man convicted of faking a plane crash
during a blizzard was sentenced Monday to a year in prison and
ordered to have a psychiatric evaluation.
   The radio report of a downed jet with three dead passengers and
a badly injured pilot sparked a search that cost $50,000 and
involved as many as 100 people, 20 aircraft and six police agencies.
   Mark Blair, 29, was convicted May 4 of making a false report to
the government, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in
prison and a $10,000 fine.
   Blair said he was not surprised by the sentence, but insists he
is innocent and plans to appeal. ``I feel that the jury didn't
listen,'' Blair said.
   U.S. Circuit Court Judge Hugh Bownes, standing in for ailing
U.S. District Judge Shane Devine, said at the sentencing that Blair
must have known the report would set off a massive ground and air
search.
   ``It seems obvious to me ... that there is some kind of mental
aberration involved for a normal person to set this kind of event
in action,'' said Bownes, who recommended that Blair be sent to a
federal prison in Butner, N.C., that has psychiatric facilities.
   He also ordered Blair to seek counseling during two years'
probation after he serves his sentence.
   At Blair's trial, David Webster, a Navy reservist and Delta
Airlines pilot, said he and his Navy crew tracked the voice of a
man who talked sporadically saying he was loosing blood, was
chilled and weak, and that at least one person in his plane was
dead.
   They were on a flight from Florida to Maine on Jan. 8 when they
were asked to assist in the search. Webster testified the crew was
overcome by emotion when the man said he heard the Navy plane
overhead.
   ``People in my plane were screaming and yelling. ... I got tears
in my eyes thinking, `We're going to get this guy out,' '' Webster
said.
   Blair testified he couldn't have committed the hoax because he
was asleep.
   But one of his neighbors in Laconia, about 20 miles north of
Concord, said he heard the sound of a two-way radio through Blair's
window and a voice crying out for help.
   Bownes denied a request that Blair be released while he appeals.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A booster rocket that was to be tested in two
weeks in Utah was damaged when a workman incorrectly installed a
test gauge, but NASA said today that the accident is not expected
to delay the resumption of space shuttle flights.
   The space shuttle Discovery is poised on its launching pad at
Cape Canaveral, Fla., for liftoff on Sept. 4. The successful
outcome of the booster rocket test in Utah is a requirement for the
launching to take place.
   NASA spokesman David Garrett said the test motor will have to be
disassembled as far as the center field joint for evaluation and
possible repairs, and then be reassembled.
   That, he said, will reuire rescheduling of the test from July 25
to ``at least mid-August.'' But, he added, ``We do not expect it
will affect the STS 26 launch schedule. ''
   STS-26 is the official designation for the first flight of a
space shuttle since a 1968 explosion destroyed Challenger and
killed seven crew members.
   Edward S. Campion, a National Aeronautics and Space
Administration spokesman, said a Morton Thiokol worker damaged the
test rocket over the weekend while attempting to install a gauge
that was to be used during a test firing.
   ``It (the gauge) was installed with an incorrect setting which
caused the hardware to be damaged,'' said Campion.
   Ed Medal, a spokesman for NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in
Huntsville, Ala., said the rocket's center field joint was
inadvertantly overpressurized during leak checks.
   He said one section of the joint was subjected to pressure of
1,000 pounds per square inch. Another section, he said, was to have
been checked at 100 psi, but was mistakenly subjected to the higher
pressure.
   The rocket engine was to be test fired in Utah on July 25.
Campion said NASA officials have said that that test must be
successfully completed before the space shuttle can fly again.
Space shuttle Discovery is now on a launch pad at the Kennedy Space
Center in Florida and is scheduled to be launched early in
September.
   Campion said officials are trying to determine how long the test
firing in Utah will be delayed by the needed repairs and if this
delay will affect the space shuttle launch.
   The test rocket in Utah incorporates a new booster design
created after the January 1986 Challenger accident, which killed
seven astronauts. Space shuttle Challenger exploded after its
launch from the Kennedy Space Center. The explosion was blamed on a
flawed rocket booster design. The space shuttle fleet has been
grounded while the booster had been redesigned and tested.
   NASA officials said the July 25 test was crucial for clearing
the shuttle for the resumption of space flights.

<HEAD>Four Convicted Of Mass Murder In Italian Bombing That Killed 85</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court on Monday sentenced four
right-wing terrorists to life in prison after convicting them of
mass murder for a 1980 bombing that killed 85 people at Bologna's
train station.
   The attack was described by prosecutors as a neo-Fascist plot to
undermine Italy's democracy.
   The court also convicted two defendants of slander: Francesco
Pazienza, the ex-financier linked to several criminal cases in
Italy, and Licio Gelli, the ex-grandmaster of the secret Propaganda
Due (P-2) Masonic lodge.
   The lodge allegedly backed right-wing terrorism and its members
included politicians, military men and leading industrialists.
   But the court, citing insufficient evidence, acquitted Gelli and
Pazienza of a more serious charge of subversive association.
   The verdicts came after a 1{-year trial in which 200 witnesses
testified.
   The Aug. 2, 1980 attack in this northern Italian city injured
200 people and demolished the waiting room filled with holiday
travelers at the station.
   Prosecutors said the terrorists hoped the massacre would help
throw Italy into confusion, paving the way for an eventual rightist
dictatorship. They said some of the defendants, who were members of
Italy's secret services at the time of the attack, aided the
terrorists.
   The jury, led by Judge Mario Antonacci, said the four defendants
who received life sentences _ Italy's stiffest penalty _ were
convicted of mass murder for by carrying out the bombing. They are
Valerio Fioravanti; his wife, Francesca Mambro; Massimiliano
Fachini; and Sergio Picciafuoco.
   Acquitted of the massacre charge for lack of evidence were Paolo
Signorelli and Roberto Rinani. Prosecutor Libero Mancusa had
accused Signorelli, a professor, of masterminding the bombing.
   But Signorelli was convicted of belonging to an armed band _ a
blanket terrorism charge used by Italian prosecutors _ and
sentenced to 12 years in prison, and Rinani got a six-year sentence
for conviction on the same charge.
   In all, eight defendants were convicted and three acquitted on
charges of belonging to an armed band. Sentences ranged from six to
16 years.
   In addition, 11 defendants were acquitted of subversive
association.
   Among those acquitted for lack of sufficient evidence of charges
of subversive association were Stefano delle Chiaie, a reputed
leading right-wing terrorist, and two former officials of Italy's
secret service police force SISMI: Gen. Pietro Musumeci and Col.
Giuseppe Belmonte.
   After convicting Gelli, Pazienza and the two former secret
service officials of aggravated slander, the court sentenced Gelli
to five years in prison and the other three to three years each.
   Gelli won't have to serve his sentence, however. Under terms of
his extradition last year from Switzerland, he can only be tried in
Italy on charges connected to the 1982 collapse of the Milan-based
Banco Ambrosiano, Italy's largest post-war banking scandal. He was
already being tried in absentia when the extradition agreement with
Switzerland was made.
   Pazienza was arrested in New York in 1985 and extradited on
charges of fraud in the Banco Ambrosiano case.
   The slander charge was based on a 1981 incident, in which
explosives similar to the kind used in the 1980 bombing were found
on a train at Bologna's station. The prosecutor contended Gelli,
Pazienza, Musumeci and Belmonte misled investigators into
concluding the explosives found in 1981 were linked to other
rightists terrorists in Italy and West Germany.

   The $12.5 million lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in 1985

   A 40-by-8-foot wall denouncing apartheid
in South Africa will remain under police protection at its
prominent Yale University site until school officials decide its
fate this fall.
   Yale Secretary Sheila Wellington said Sunday the school will
review its policies on freedom of expression when students and
faculty return, and ``it did not seem to be the mature thing to do
to destroy the wall before the review.''
   University officials originally told anti-apartheid activists
the plywood wall, which replaced symbolic shanties destroyed by
arson June 5, could stay for four days. However, the school later
decided it could be erected periodically if it were dismantled and
put in storage for the summer.
   ``Obviously, to react in haste while the university is not in
session and (while) we cannot have the benefit of the ideas and
opinions of faculty and staff and students seems to us to raise
problems accordingly,'' Wellington said.
   Yale's Coalition Against Apartheid, which built the wall,
declared the decision a victory.
   The coalition had said it would not dismantle the structure
until Yale sold all its stock holdings in companies that do
business in South Africa.
   Wellington said it was not a victory for the coalition, but a
decision by Yale President Benno C. Schmidt and herself to
carefully review the school's position.
   Yale has provided 24-hour police protection for the structure,
which Wellington said has been the subject of several arson threats.
   The wall was built June 16 to replace a shantytown that had
stood in the same location for more than two years.

J. Franz, who also sought to be appointed Simmons' legal
representative to pursue appeals Simmons rejected.
   The court said Monday there was no legal basis to grant the
request by Franz, of Star City, head of the anti-death penalty
Arkansas Churches for Life. His attorney, Mark Cambiano of
Morrilton, said an appeal was likely.
   ``I don't know whether we'll try to go straight to the U.S.
Supreme Court or what,'' Cambiano said. ``I'm disappointed. I felt
and I still feel that we are correct in our assessment of the
situation.''
   Simmons was convicted May 12 of two counts of murder in a
rampage Dec. 28 in Russellville in which four other people were
wounded. Police later found the bodies of 14 relatives on his
property north of Dover and he is charged in those deaths.
   Simmons gave up his right to appeal, asked that no one interfere
in his case and said he wanted to die at the earliest possible
date. Franklin County Circuit Court Judge John S. Patterson ruled
May 16 that Simmons knew what he was doing in giving up the appeal.
Franz appealed.
   Lawyers for Simmons, following Simmons' instructions, opposed
Franz' attempt to become his representative. So did the state and
Prosecuting Attorney Johm Bynum of Russellville.
   The Supreme Court said Monday it would review cases of a people
sentenced to die who decided against appeals, but refused to
declare that review of death sentences is mandatory.
   It said Simmons was competent to give up his right to appeal.

<HEAD>Decision On Great Lakes Diversion Weeks Away</HEAD>

   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is still
weeks away from deciding whether more Great Lakes water should be
diverted to the drought-depleted Mississippi River, officials said
Monday.
   The White House, which last month ordered the Corps to examine
the issue, has set no deadline despite mounting regional reguests
for more river water.
   ``There are a lot of traps to watch out for _ environmental,
engineering, international concerns, treaties that would be
involved,'' said White House spokesman B.J. Cooper. ``It is not a
simple decision.''
   Corps spokesman Mike Keuss said the study would be completed
``hopefully by the end of July.''
   Thirteen senators on Friday urged President Reagan to authorize
diversion of an additional 7,000 cubic feet-per-second of Great
Lakes water into the Mississippi, where low levels have stalled as
many as 3,000 barges. The request, similar to one made in late June
by Illinois Gov. James Thompson, proposed increasing the diversion
rate to 10,000 cubic feet-per-second for 100 days.
   The proposals set off an inter-regional squabble between
officials of states bordering the Great Lakes and those depending
upon the Mississippi.
   ``We are a union, and when one of our states and several of our
states find themselves in trouble, we try to come to each other's
help,'' said Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., in an appearance on NBC's
``Today'' show. ``We're not asking for anything that would damage
the Lake Michigan area.''
   Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., on the same program, said he
foresaw the likelihood of immediate lawsuits if Reagan were to
authorize the diversion.
   ``We need to preserve this water. ... It is very important to
the future of the country. If we're ever going to use it, we ought
to use it to drink and not to float ships down the Mississippi,''
Riegle said.
   Under a 1986 law, any increase in the diversion rate requires
the approval of the governor of each of the eight Great Lakes
states.
   Only Thompson of Illinois has said he favors increased diversion.
   The governors of Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin and Minnesota have
said they oppose diverting more water.
   Indiana and New York were awaiting completion of the Corps study
before deciding whether to support or oppose greater diversion.
   ``We have an open mind on this question,'' said Indiana Lt. Gov.
John Mutz, chairman of the state's drought advisory commission.
   The state would not approve diversion for purposes other than
navigation, he said. ``I would not want them sticking their hoses
into this river and irrigating out of there at a time when we are
actually rationing our water for farmers in Indiana,'' he said.
   Pennsylvania has not stated a position.
   Supporters of diversion said the drought has depressed the
Mississippi River to its lowest level since record-keeping began in
1872, stranding as many as 3,000 barges with losses to the barge
and towing industry expected to run as high as $60 million.
   Opponents said water levels in the Great Lakes have dropped 3
feet in the last two years and the water is needed for Midwest
agriculture.
   The lower lake levels have not hindered the St. Lawrence
Seaway's ability to carry goods, said James Emery, administrator of
the U.S. St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corp.
   He suggested the seaway, which connects the Great Lakes and the
Atlantic Ocean, would be a ``viable economic alternative'' for
moving cargo stranded by low water on the Mississippi.

<HEAD>Iran Says Black Box Still Missing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Iran is still searching for
the ``black box'' recorder that may hold important information
about the flight of a jetliner shot down by a U.S. warship, the
Iranian navy commander said Monday.
   Commodore Mohammed Hussein Malekzadegan spoke after the
English-language Dubai newspaper Khaleej Times, quoting salvage
experts it did not identify, said Iranian frogmen recovered the
flight recorder in the Persian Gulf ``a couple of days ago.''
   Malekzadegan said in an interview on Tehran radio the black box
``may have been destroyed'' when missiles fired by the cruiser USS
Vincennes hit the Iran Air Airbus on July 3, killing all 290 people
aboard.
   ``It's also possible that we may find it,'' he said. ``In any
case, the search is continuing.''
   Data in the recorder could help determine whether the Airbus
A300 received radio warnings from the Vincennes. The Pentagon says
the jetliner did not respond to warnings and the cruiser's radar
operators mistook the plane for an F-14 fighter because it seemed
to be emitting military-type responses.
   American officials have backed away from earlier claims that the
plane was descending or was outside civilian flight lanes.
   The Khaleej Times said the salvage experts it quoted had worked
with Iran in the past and expressed surprise that recovery of the
black box had not been announced.
   It also quoted Itay's commander in the gulf, Rear Adm. Angelo
Mariani, as saying the heavy air and sea traffic could complicate
investigations of the tragedy.
   ``There are so many boats, small and big ships, airliners,
military jets of various kinds,'' he said.
   Mariani said the Italian frigate Espero heard a U.S. warship,
not identified, radio at least one warning to an aircraft shortly
before the Airbus was shot down, the Khaleej Times said.
   ``Since we only listen to military frequencies, I cannot confirm
whether the same message was repeated on the civilian international
frequency or not, but I assume it must have been,'' he was quoted
as saying.
   Pentagon spokesmen said repeated warnings were sent on military
and civilian channels.
   In London, the Sunday Times said a British intelligence report
based on monitored radio communications is ``severely critical'' of
the U.S. Navy for shooting the airliner down.
   According to the Times, the report says Iran Air Flight 655 left
Bandar Abbas for Dubai only three minutes late, was on the correct
flight path and was climbing when the missiles struck.
   It said the report suggested a skirmish with armed Iranian
speedboats in which the shooting started July 3 may have been
provoked by U.S. helicopters entering Iranian air space. The
Vincennes and the USS Elmer Montgomery destroyed two boats and
damaged one before the cruiser shot the plane down.
   The U.S. Navy was escorting the year's 46th convoy of
U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers Monday, moving up the gulf to the
sheikdom. The 294,739-ton products carrier Townsend was accompanied
by the frigate Robert G. Bradley, said a spokesman at U.S. Central
Command headquarters in Tampa, Fla.
   Eleven Kuwait-owned tankers have been given U.S. registraton so
the Navy can protect them. Convoys began in July 1987.
   A Navy investigation of the Airbus disaster was in its sixth day
Monday and the Vincennes was anchored off Bahrain with two barges
alongside. Its crew has been restricted to the ship for security
reasons, with sailors allowed ashore only in small groups to make
telephone calls home.

   Two crew members of a Jordanian airliner
hijacked in 1985 have entered U.S. protective custody in order to
testify against a suspected Lebanese terrorist charged in the case,
a prosecutor said Monday.
   The disclosure that the two unidentified members of the Royal
Jordanian airliner had entered the federal witness protection
program was made at a pre-trial hearing in the case of Fawaz
Younis, charged with leading the June 11, 1985 hijacking.
   The former airline employees left their homes in the Middle East
and were placed under U.S. protection following ``their decision to
testify in the trial,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Ramsey Johnson told
U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker.
   A Middle Eastern man who identified Younis at a court-ordered
lineup is also being sought as a witness, Johnson said.
   The FBI is trying to locate the man, who was a passenger on
board the hijacked airliner, because ``we believe he is an
excellent witness,'' he added.
   A former member of Lebanon's Shiite Amal militia, Younis was
arrested last September after he was lured aboard an FBI-chartered
yacht in the Mediterranean by the prospect, according to FBI
agents, of completing a drug deal.
   Jamal Hamdan, a former resident of Cyprus who cooperated with
the FBI's efforts to entice his former friend onto the yacht, is
also in protective custody.
   The federal witness protection program gives people new
identities and helps them set up life in a new location to protect
them from reprisals for testifying against criminal defendants.
   Younis is awaiting trial on charges that he led a group of five
armed men who stormed the Boeing 727 at Beirut International
Airport and forced it to fly to several locations around the
Mediterranean before it returned to Beirut.
   The plane's 74 passengers and crew members, including several
Jordanian sky marshals, were let off the plane before it was blown
up on the runway.
   Parker indicated that he had found a classified document that
contradicts an earlier prosecution statement that the FBI never
considered placing a defense lawyer on the Navy ship where Younis
was interrogated four days after his arrest.
   The secret document was forwarded to the U.S. Court of Appeals
here, which is considering whether Younis' confession to FBI agents
should be admitted as evidence.
   Parker ruled in February that the confession was illegally
obtained because Younis, suffering seasickness and pain from two
broken wrists, was in no condition to exercise his constitutional
right to remain silent.
   Younis suffered the two wrist fractures when FBI agents slammed
him to the deck of the yacht.
   In his opinion, which prosecutors have appealed, Parker said he
couldn't understand why the FBI, during its lengthy planning of the
arrest operation, had not considered putting an attorney aboard the
Navy vessel to advise Younis during the interrogation.
   At Monday's hearing, the judge noted that Johnson had previously
told him the idea ``just didn't come up.''
   Parker, indicating the secret document he had examined
contradicted that answer, told Johnson: ``You are charged with the
knowledge of the information contained'' in the secret documents
turned over to the court.
   On June 30, the appeals court ordered Parker to conduct a
hearing on admitting the document into evidence under the
Classified Information Procedures Act.
   The appeals court said the document ``raises questions that go
directly'' to Younis' claim he was denied a right to counsel during
his interrogation.
   Parker gave Johnson 48 hours to contact government agencies
about declassifying the document and scheduled a hearing for July
18.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev offered
Monday to withdraw an unspecified number of air forces from Eastern
Europe if NATO drops plans to deploy 72 U.S.-built, F-16
fighter-bombers in Italy.
   Gorbachev also said that East and West European leaders should
informally explore ways to break the impasse in negotiations aimed
at reducing conventional forces in Europe.
   The Communist Party chief made the proposals in an address to
the Polish parliament, the Sejm, at the start of a six-day visit to
Poland.
   ``Verbally everyone is for the necessity of reducing
conventional arms and in practice they are still expanding military
reserves,'' said Gorbachev.
   The Soviets want to break that pattern, he added.
   ``For instance, we are ready to withdraw our analogous air
forces from the extended bases in Eastern Europe if NATO agrees not
to deploy its 72 F-16 fighter-bombers.''
   Gorbachev also reiterated a Soviet plan for resuming
conventional arms talks with an exchange of troop data and an
initial withdrawal of 500,000 troops from both NATO and Warsaw Pact
forces in Europe.
   The Soviet leader offered to explore informally with the Western
powers ways to break the deadlock that has long blocked progress
toward a conventional arms reduction agreement.
   The sides have never agreed on how to count their respective
armies and have found no starting point for force reductions.
   ``If NATO shows such readiness, we can discuss the problem of
the lack of balance before the start of official talks about the
data concerning troops,'' he said. Western observers claim Warsaw
Pact forces far outnumber NATO units facing them in Europe.
   NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner expressed skepticism
about the new Soviet offer.
   ``We are committed to establishing a stable and secure balance
of conventional forces at lower levels in Europe,'' Woerner said in
a statement issued in Brussels, Belgium.
   ``A focus on aircraft does not meet this central requirement,''
he added. ``We need asymmetrical reductions, notably in tanks and
artillery, in order to eliminate the most worrying disparities.''
   Referring indirectly to a sore point in the relations between
the Soviet Union and Poland, Gorbachev pledged to pursue the search
for facts explaining the ``blank spots'' in Soviet history.
   But Gorbachev did not mention the massacre of 4,500 Polish
military officers in the Katyn forest shortly after the outbreak of
World War II.
   A joint study commission already has been established to
investigate what happened during Soviet dictator Josef Stalin's
rule, and there had been speculation before Gorbachev's arrival
that he would acknowledge Soviet responsibility for the slaughter.
   ``One cannot change history,'' the Soviet leader said. ``But one
can and should draw conclusions from it.''
   ``We condemn Stalinist repressions,'' Gorbachev said. ``As it is
known, they also covered many Polish communists,'' who disappeared
after being summoned to Moscow by Stalin.
   Several youths staged a demonstration in central Warsaw before
Gorbachev's speech, waving banners saying, ``We demand the truth
about Katyn. Reparation for deportations.''
   The Polish Communist Party chief, Wojciech Jaruzelski, greeted
Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, when their Aeroflot jet arrived at
Warsaw's Okecie Airport.
   The Gorbachevs then approached a crowd of several hundred
flag-waving citizens, and Gorbachev paused to sign several
autographs and chat with people in the crowd.
   Gorbachev's motorcade made an unannounced stop at a traffic
circle in Warsaw, where the Soviet leader got out to greet
onlookers and sign copies of his book, ``Perestroika.''
   Gorbachev and Jaruzelski then conferred privately for two hours
at communist party headquarters. The official news agency PAP said
the two exchanged views on economic, political and social renewal
taking place in their countries.
   The visit to Poland, to be capped at week's end with a summit
meeting of the Warsaw Pact countries, marks Gorbachev's first major
public appearance since the July 1 close of the Soviet Communist
Party Conference in Moscow.
   Government and opposition leaders in Poland expressed hope the
Soviet leader would reinvigorate the movement for Polish economic
reforms.
   The leading opposition group, the outlawed labor union
Solidarity, issued a statement welcoming Gorbachev and lauding his
effort to increase open debate.
   Solidarity said it hoped the visit would lead to significant
changes in Poland and in Soviet-Polish relations.
   But Gennady Gerasimov, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman,
told reporters asking about Solidarity, ``I think it would be
better if these forces join the process of socialist renewal, and
not inhibit it as sometimes happens today.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Brotherhood of Teamsters'
top official in New England, William J. McCarthy, is emerging as a
possible consensus challenger to Jackie Presser's choice for the
union's presidency, sources close to the Teamsters said Monday.
   Presser, who died Saturday night in a suburban Cleveland
hospital after an 18-month battle against lung and brain cancer,
had turned over temporary control of the government-besieged union
in May to Secretary-Treasurer Weldon Mathis, naming him interim
president for 120 days.
   Mathis, 62, is still considered the odds-on-favorite to succeed
Presser, but not without a challenge from some of the 16 regional
vice presidents and board members unhappy with with the way he has
run the union while Presser was incapacitated most of the past year.
   One Teamster insider said ``the big question'' is whether enough
of those 16 vice presidents, many of whom would like the top job,
can unite behind one challenger to Mathis.
   Sources said that McCarthy, of Boston, a Teamster vice president
since 1969, has support from at least five other vice presidents
for mounting a challenge.
   Under the Teamsters' constitution, Mathis and the 16 vice
presidents are required to meet within 15 days of Presser's death
to elect a successor.
   The jockeying is intensifying just two weeks after the
government, claiming all of the Teamsters' top leaders are
influenced by racketeers, filed suit to place the entire union
under the control of a court-appointed trustee.
   The government contends in the suit that crime bosses in New
York and Chicago engineered the elevation of Presser and his
predecessor, Roy Williams, to the union's presidency in 1983 and
1981, respectively.
   Teamster officials have vehemently denied the allegations and a
federal criminal court jury in New York two months ago found that
the government had insuffient evidence to back them up.
   Meanwhile, spokesmen for the union are mum about Presser's
successor.
   ``Nobody's talking about it except the press,'' Duke Zeller, the
Teamsters director of information, said Monday. ``Nothing is going
to happen until after the funeral (Tuesday).''
   Zeller said no executive board meeting has been scheduled yet,
adding that the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta and a
conference meeting of Michigan Teamsters, both next week, may be
complicating factors.
   Until Presser's death, Mathis had intended to host a reception
next week in Atlanta, his home town and base of power in the union,
symbolizing an end to the Teamsters' 32-year enchantment with
Republican presidential candidates.
   Presser picked Mathis to be his number two official in 1985. A
year later, Presser initiated a rewriting of the Teamsters'
constitution so that Mathis, rather the Joseph Trerotola of New
York, the union's ranking vice president, would assume interim
control if he were disabled.
   Mathis, according to Teamster insiders, angered many of the
``old guard'' vice presidents in the way the reins were passed to
him two months ago. Eight of them boycotted the first board meeting
that he convened afterwards.
   In addition, Mathis' strength has been weakened by majority
rank-and-file ``no'' votes on the union's two biggest contracts
this year _ the National Master Freight Agreement, covering most of
the unionized interstate trucking industry, and a three-year accord
with United Parcel Service.
   Because it takes a two-thirds membership vote to disapprove a
contract, they were declared ratified.
   But in a rare departure from the Teamsters' tradition to keep
dissent at the top within the family, McCarthy challenged the terms
of the freight accord openly in conversations with reporters and
addresses before local union halls.
   ``What's amazing is that all this infighting has sloshed out in
the open,'' said Ken Paff, an organizer for a 10,000-member
dissident faction called Teamsters for a Democratic Union.
   Other names that have surfaced as possible challengers to Mathis
for succeeding Presser include Vice Presidents Arnie Weinmeister of
Seattle, Joseph Morgan of Hallandale, Fla., and Walter Shea of
Washington.
   Sources said Weinmeister and Shea have pulled themselves out of
the running, although both, along with Trerotola, are considered to
have the ability to sway other votes on the board.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Lafontant Joseph, a prominent human
rights activist, was found beaten and stabbed to death Monday in a
jeep near the Port-au-Prince airport, police said.
   ``This murder is a very serious incident,'' Jean-Claude Bajeux,
director of the Ecumenical Center for Human Rights, told The
Associated Press. ``It means that the lives of all militants for
human rights in Haiti are in danger.''
   Paul Latortue, a former senatorial candidate who lives in exile
in Puerto Rico, blamed the murder on government leader Lt. Gen.
Henri Namphy.
   ``I have no doubt that this is a political killing,'' he said.
``It's connected with the government.''
   Joseph, 54, director of Haiti's Center of Education for Human
Rights, was found dead in his four-wheel drive vehicle near Mais
Gate International Airport, just outside the capital. A passerby
recognized the dead man and contacted his family.
   The activist's nephew, physician Ronald Joseph, said Joseph had
been stabbed once in his chest and two or three times in his back.
``The body looked mutilated,'' he said.
   Army Maj. Joseph Baguidy, head of Haiti's Bureau of Criminal
Investigation, said police found blood about 500 yards from the
car, indicating Joseph was killed outside the vehicle.
   There appeared to be more than one assailant, Baguidy said. He
did not elaborate.
   The police official said the seats of the car were found in a
horizontal position and that police discovered a pair of women's
sandals in the vehicle.
   He said it was possible a woman may have been in the car with
Joseph, but that no other body had been located.
   ``We are now examining the blood to see whether there was
another victim,'' he said.
   Radio Metropole, an independent station, said Joseph was last
seen alive by his wife, Raymonde, whom he dropped off at their home
Sunday night. Mrs. Joseph, director of the Haitian Women's
Committee Against Torture, was the first to identify her husband's
body.
   Joseph, a lawyer, founded the Center of Education for Human
Rights in 1986 and was a co-founder of the League of Human Rights.
   In November 1980, under dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier, he was
arrested, jailed and tortured for his outspoken criticism of the
government. Joseph was then ordered to leave Haiti, but refused to
do so.
   Before the national elections scheduled for November 29, which
were suspended because of civil violence, Joseph was a candidate
for a Senate seat on the leftist National Front ticket.
   At the time of his death, the activist was director of the
Elliot Pierre High School.
   Latortue said the killing was connected with an incident last
week in which four men in black uniforms with Uzi machine guns
burst into the home of sociologist Laennec Hurbon while he was
away, ransacked the premises and stole $1,300.
   Joseph and Laennec were both prominent members of the National
Congress of Democratic Movements, a political group working to
organize Haitians and uphold the constitution.
   ``It's an attempt to kill one by one those who argue for
democratic development,'' said Latortue, whose brother Gerard was
foreign minister in the government of President Leslie Manigat, who
was ousted in June.
   ``We have entered a different phase in Haiti now where political
killings in the street are going to take place. They don't arrest
you, they kill you in the streets and make it appear that it is the
work of bandits.''
   ``Haitians now live within a system which gives the lives and
property of its citizens no protection. Anything can happen and no
one can prevent any determined gang of killers from doing as it
sees fit,'' Bajeux said.
   Namphy, who took power in a coup June 19, suspended the
constitution Haitians approved in a March 1987 referendum.

   A train carrying about 300 passengers
crashed into a stalled cargo train in southeastern Brazil on
Monday, and railroad authorities said 80 people were injured.
   Valeria Hartt, a spokeswoman for the Sao Paulo State Railroad
Co., said in a telephone interview that only one person was
seriously injured.
   The accident occurred in the city of Valinhos 55 miles northwest
of Sao Paulo, South America's largest city.
   ``The passenger train, heading for Sao Paulo, crashed into the
rear of the cargo train which had stalled on the same tracks
because of a mechanical failure,'' Ms. Hartt said.
   Both trains were partially damaged and the track was expected to
be cleared by Monday night when normal service would resume.
   Ms. Hartt said an investigation would be held to determine why
the passenger train was not warned about the stalled cargo train.

   A West German army general has been
named commander of NATO's Allied Command Europe Mobile Force, NATO
announced Monday.
   Brig. Gen. Peter Heinrich Carstens will replace Italian Maj.
Gen. Franco Angioni on Jan. 1 and assume the rank of major general,
NATO's Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe said.
   The Allied Command Europe Mobile Force, based at Heidelberg,
West Germany, was formed in 1960. The unit of land and air forces
from several NATO nations is designed to deploy quickly at the
first sign of hositilities and to act as a deterrent force by
showing NATO's resolve and unity.
   Carstens, 51, is now based in Cologne where he is West Germany's
assistant chief of staff in charge of training. He will be the
first German general to command the Mobile Force.

<HEAD>Domino Transplant Recipient Dies 14 Months After Procedure</HEAD>

   Clinton House, who survived 14 months with a
donated heart and lungs he received after donating his own healthy
heart in the nation's first domino donor transplant, died Monday,
Johns Hopkins Hospital said.
   House, 29, a Baltimore refrigeration mechanic who suffered from
cystic fibrosis, died of complications related to rejection,
according to Phil Kibak, a spokesman at Johns Hopkins.
   House had received the heart and lungs of a brain-dead accident
victim in a 17-hour operation May 10-11, 1987, and donated his
otherwise healthy heart to John Couch, 39, of Yardley, Pa., Kibak
said.
   Couch is reported to be doing well, Kibak said.
   In February, House was placed on a list awaiting a second double
transplant, Kibak said.
   ``Clint never really took off (with the new organs). He had
problems now and again, primarily related to the rejection,'' Kibak
said.
   Cystic fibrosis causes the production of a thick, sticky mucus
that clogs the lungs and digestive system. It is the nation's most
common inherited disease, afflicting about 30,000 Americans, and
usually kills victims by the time they reach their mid-20s.
   House had awaited the new heart and lungs for a year before a
donor was found.
   The heart-lung procedure was the first so-called domino
transplant performed in the United States. Doctors in Great Britain
had earlier performed a similar procedure.

   The USS Eisenhower, an aircraft carrier of
the 6th Fleet, on Monday began its first maneuvers with the Israeli
navy, the fleet commander said.
   The exercises from the northern port city will involve mock
combat at sea and refueling of the carrier by Israeli naval
vessels, the fleet commander, Vice Adm. Kendall Moranville, told
reporters.
   Moranville said the exercise will continue into next week,
following a weekend break. He would not provide other details.
   The Eisenhower, with 7,000 crew, pilots and Marines aboard,
docked at Haifa in the past but never had conducted maneuvers with
the Israelis, Moranville said. Israel has conducted naval exercises
with other ships in the 6th fleet.
   An Israeli army spokesman, in keeping with Israeli security
policy, refused to say how many Israeli troops were involved in the
operations.

   Comedian Milton Berle, whose 80th
birthday Tuesday will be celebrated with 200 friends, says he is
healthy and feels like a 20-year-old, ``but there's never one
around.''
   ``It'll just be a usual day for me,'' Berle said Monday.
   His wife is throwing a bash for him Tuesday at La Cage Aux
Folles, and the guest list includes Frank Sinatra, Red Buttons,
Steve Allen, Danny Thomas, Sid Caesar, Jack Lemmon, Don Rickles and
Gregory Peck.
   ``Tomorrow night I'm going to miss the All-Star (baseball) game,
but I'm going to have an all-star game of my own,'' said Berle.
   It was his mother, Sandra Berlinger, who bounced Baby Milton on
her knee and said: ``Make me laugh.'' He's kept the nation laughing
ever since.
   Beamed into America's living rooms in 1948, Berle was host of
TV's first hit show, ``Texaco Star Theater,'' which caused power
drains on Tuesday nights.
   Audiences relished Berle's brash, slapstick humor, often
featuring him in women's clothes or taking a cream pie in the face.
   His vaudevillian antics endeared him to a generation of
Americans and earned him the title ``Mr. Television.'' Columnist
Walter Winchell called him ``The Thief of Badgags.''
   ``Even though I have 60 years in this business,'' said Sammy
Davis Jr., ``I hope to know as much as Milton does about show
business when I am 80 years old.''
   Lucille Ball, looking forward to the gathering, said Monday:
``He's really 80 years young and his contribution to the world of
comedy will live forever.''
   ``He's really excited about the party,'' added Ruth Berle, who
has been married to the comedian since 1953.
   Cakes aglow with dozens of candles and birthday wishes will be
the order of the day.
   Berle opens at Caesar's Palace in Atlantic City, N.J., on Aug. 9
with Danny Thomas and Sid Caesar. He then has performances
scheduled in Las Vegas, Nev., beginning Aug. 24.
   ``He's really happiest when he works on stage,'' said Mrs. Berle.
   Berle underwent a heart bypass operation in 1985.

   The first policeman ever shot and
killed on duty in Florida's capital was buried in a driving rain
Monday after a long funeral procession carried family, friends and
other officers through the downpour.
   The motorcade took slain Officer Ernest Ponce de Leon to his
grave after mourners heard Officer William Scott eulogize him as a
``winner'' who had triumphed over personal setbacks.
   Ponce de Leon, 40, had dropped out of high school but later
returned to earn a diploma and attended Florida State University,
Scott said.
   Troopers, sheriff's deputies and officers from Florida, Georgia
and Alabama packed the Tallahassee church where funeral services
were held. Mourners jammed aisles and spilled onto the lawn.
   Ponce de Leon was killed while checking out the occupants of a
car. Three of the people in the car turned out to be Maryland
prison escapees. All have been charged with first-degree murder.

<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Informal weekend talks between the striking
Writers Guild of America and TV and movie producers failed to end
the 19-week strike that has nearly crippled the industry, but at
least one side reported progress.
   ``We're heartened at this point that these informal talks are
continuing,'' guild spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden said Monday.
   The talks between WGA West Executive Director Brian Walton and
Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers negotiator J.
Nicholas Counter III have been held by telephone and in person.
They are in contact daily.
   Guild sources, while refusing to predict when the strike might
end, have indicated substantial progress is being made. ``We're
trying to get this town back to work,'' Walton said Monday.
   The guild and the producers alliance are divided on payments for
reruns of one-hour television programs and shows broadcast
overseas. The strike, which began March 7, has triggered sweeping
layoffs throughout Hollywood and has obliterated the fall
television season.
   The guild's negotitating committee met extensively over the last
several days exploring strategies that might end the strike. The
committee met for four hours Friday and five hours Saturday.
   Herb Steinberg, a spokesman for the alliance, discounted the
importance of the informal talks. ``Negotiations are closed. They
are over,'' Steinberg said. ``Our last contract offer is final.''
Steinberg did not deny, however, that Counter and Walton were
meeting.
   Meanwhile, some of Hollywood's top writer-producers joined
forces Friday to discuss other means of resolving the labor
dispute. Among those participating in the meeting were Gary David
Goldberg of ``Family Ties,'' Glenn Gordon Caron of
``Moonlighting,'' Stephen J. Cannell of ``Wiseguy,'' and Steven
Bochco of ``L.A. Law.''
   Some of the entertainment industry's leading agents also are
interceding on a regular basis in an effort to encourage a strike
settlement.

<HEAD>Senate Says D.C.'s Catholic Schools Can Deny Gay Privileges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate approved on a voice vote Monday
legislation which authorizes Catholic universities in the city to
deny equal treatment to homosexual student organizations.
   The measure was sponsored by Sen. William Armstrong, R-Colo.,
and passed as an amendment to the District of Columbia's $3.2
billion budget bill. Armstrong argued that church institutions, as
a matter of religious liberty, have the right to exclude gay groups
from student organizations accorded campus resources.
   Sen. Lowell Weicker, R-Conn., argued the amendment would codify
discrimination. ``The subject matter before us is outrageous,''
Weicker charged. ``It is just good, old-fashioned straightforward
bigotry ... this thing should go back down the sewer from which it
came.''
   Armstrong denied that his proposal was anti-homosexual, and said
it was designed to correct a problem which arose for Georgetown
University when a D.C. appellate court ruled that the school had
violated the city's Human Rights Code by denying equal treatment to
gay organizations.
   In the wake of that ruling, Georgetown agreed in March to
provide meeting space, a mailbox, and the right to apply for
student government funding to two gay student groups. But the
school was not required, under the settlement, to officially
recognize the student groups. University leaders said official
recognition would violate church teachings.
   Georgetown did not encourage Armstrong to propose his amendment
and has no intention of reversing the March agreement or denying
similar access to gay groups in the future, according to Betsy
Whittleder, a school spokeswoman.
   The city budget bill was approved by the Senate on a 64-29 vote,
but now must go to a House-Senate conference committee to work out
differences between the two chambers.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Feeding Tube Can Be Removed From Comatose Woman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DANBURY, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The family of a 56-year-old comatose woman
can order doctors to remove the feeding tube keeping her alive and
grant what relatives say would have been her wish to die, a judge
ruled Monday.
   Carol McConnell, a registered nurse who suffered permanent brain
damage in a car accident three years ago, remains in a coma at a
Danbury nursing home. She can breathe but is fed by a tube
connected to her stomach. Doctors said she will die if the tube is
removed.
   In a ruling released Monday, Superior Court Judge Anne C.
Dranginis gave the defendants, including the state attorney
general's office, 20 days to appeal.
   ``This is a wonderful decision in favor of the family, but much
more in favor of the public's right to have its wishes carried out
when a person becomes permanently vegetative and expresses clearly
that they didn't want'' to be kept alive by artificial means, said
Stephen Wise, lawyer for McConnell's family.
   During a trial in June, lawyers for the state argued that a 1985
statute regarding the removal of life-support systems prohibits
withholding ``nutrition and hydration.''
   Wise said Mrs. McConnell's three children believe their mother
was a ``totally informed person who knew about life-support systems
and clearly expressed her wishes that they not be administered.''
   Mrs. McConnell's husband, John McConnell, tearfully told
Dranginis last month that his wife wouldn't have wanted to be kept
alive through extraordinary means.
   Mrs. McConnell was head nurse in the Danbury Hospital emergency
room at the time of her car accident.
   The Society for the Right To Die said Connecticut is one of six
states with laws excluding feeding tubes from the life-sustaining
procedures that can be withheld with a relative's permission or
because the patient has so instructed previously in writing in a
so-called ``living will.''
   Seven states permit removal of feeding tubes, while the
legislation is ambiguous in 12 states and the remainder don't have
laws dealing with the subject, the society said.

<HEAD>Watchdog Agency Traces Contracting Probe to Reagan Buildup</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon contracting investigation is a
direct result of President Reagan's defense buildup, and the
spending surge also will soon cause ``many big cost overruns'' on
weapons, the head of the congressional General Accounting Office
said Monday.
   ``History shows that when too much money is pumped into the
acquisition system over a relatively short period of time, we will
have problems,'' Comptroller General Charles Bowsher told the
Senate Armed Services Committee.
   ``We had procurement scandals during World War II, the Korean
War and in the past few years _ all during periods of rapid growth
in defense spending,'' the watchdog agency chief said.
   The current criminal investigation involves allegations that
defense contractors and consultants, many of them former military
men, bribed Pentagon officials for contracting details that could
be vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars. No charges
have yet been filed.
   Criminal investigations aren't the only problems, Bowsher said.
   ``In addition to these scandals, I think the other shoe will
probably fall soon, namely, many big cost overruns,'' he told the
committee.
   ``I suspect the Stealth airplane program, the Navy shipbuilding
programs and the other programs which have to be stretched because
of budget constraints will all result in very large cost increases
that the Congress will have to finance,'' he said.
   Bowsher was referring to a common Defense Department response to
congressionally ordered budget reductions, in which the same number
of weapons are bought over a longer period of time. That commonly
drives up the price of individual weapons.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, during his eight months in
office, has thus far generally opposed program ``stretchouts.''
Instead, he has ordered that some weapons be eliminated. For
example, he has told the Navy to mothball 16 aging frigates and has
ordered Air Force reductions to meet reduced defense budgets.
   Bowsher, comparing the current investigation with past
procurement scandals, said ``one thing that distinguishes that is
it's fairly high up ... The thing that discourages me the most is
that some very senior people might be involved.''
   Past cases generally involved relatively low-level personnel
trading information, Bowsher explained.
   He noted reports that former Assistant Navy Secretary Melvyn
Paisley is a target of the Justice Department probe.
   Bowsher said ``I'm surprised that that an assistant secretary
had that much control over procurement.''
   One of the reforms instituted by former Navy Secretary John
Lehman, who brought Paisley into the Pentagon job, was elimination
of the Navy Materiel Command, an agency that had been involved in
purchasing. Lehman's move was aimed at streamlining procurement.
   But now, said Bowsher, it appears that move, along with some
other procurement changes, may have ``eliminated some of the key
controls'' that had kept a check on spending.
   Still, he said, ``I would suggest not rushing into that area''
and passing a lot of new laws or ordering a halt in what Carlucci
has called ``tainted contracts.'' Carlucci earlier this month
ordered the suspension of nine contracts worth an estimated $1
billion.
   ``It might be better to let the investigative process work,''
said Bowsher. Later, if there are indictments, those contracts
could be suspended and if there are convictions, the contractors
could eventually be debarred from doing business with the Pentagon,
he noted.
   However, the Defense Department announced Monday that it has
debarred two companies and three individuals from doing business
and was moving to suspend a fourth person from his Pentagon job. At
the same time, it said payments were being resumed on most of the
contracts that Carluci suspended July 1.
   Elsewhere in his testimony, Bowsher said ``we need to be
realistic in projecting the quality, cost and schedule of our
systems in relation to the state of technology involved. We still
are unable to get contractors to build things right the first time,
as is clearly obvious in the case of the B-1B (bomber) program.''
   That program, resurrected by Reagan seven years ago after being
scrapped by former President Carter, has been plagued by
difficulties. Most recently, the Air Force acknowledged that the
B-1B is having electronics problems that will be costly to fix, if
they can be repaired.
   ``It is clear to me that some of what went wrong on the B-1B
included concurrency (testing and producing at the same time),
inadequate testing, a push to deliver on time and at cost _ no
matter what, while stretching the state of technology,'' Bowsher
said.
   ``Until we do this better, we will continue to buy into programs
which will not achieve their advertised performance capabilities
and will continue to exacerbate the affordability issues,'' he said.

   Peddlers of hot dogs and sushi, frozen yogurt
and hot soup have for five years ignored a law that would keep them
off the sidewalks where business is best. On Monday, the vendors
fell victim to politics.
   In an effort to rid some of the city's busiest corners of
congestion, police armed with forklifts were sent for take out: not
food, but the pushcarts that sell quick and affordable lunches and
snacks. The vendors were there, with their familiar orange-and-blue
umbrellas, but the pushcarts weren't.
   ``We're trying to spoil the policemen's party,'' said hot dog
vendor Thomas Michaelides. ``They'll get no blood from me today.''
   The vendors called their gathering a protest. A spokesman for
Mayor Edward I. Koch called it capitulation to the law that imposes
fines up to $1,000 and storage costs for impounded pushcarts of $65
a day.
   By 5 p.m., only three carts had been confiscated, police said.
   ``They were faced with confiscation and fines and we warned them
of those consequences and as a result we don't have any carts in
those banned areas,'' said Koch spokesman Cliff Chanin.
   ``So we choose to see it as compliance of the law.''
   Koch admitted the crackdown was political arm-twisting to get
the City Council to pass a new law which would allow six vendors,
chosen by lottery, to work each prime street block, three on one
side and three on the other.
   Vendors and council members balked at that, prompting the
crackdown.
   As angry vendors congregated along Sixth Avenue, handing out
leaflets, the M. Parpis Food Distribution Co., which owns 50
vending carts, went to court to fight the ban. Parpis' lawyers
argued in state Supreme Court that the law is an unreasonable use
of regulatory power. Justice Irving Kirschenbaum disagreed.
   John P. Goros, 38, who owns M. Parpis, said he would appeal.
   The 1983 law bans vendors from Manhattan corners between 34th
and 59th streets and between Third and Eighth avenues _ an area
that includes busy Times Square and Rockefeller Center _ in the
Wall Street area; along First Avenue near the United Nations; and
in Fulton Market in Brooklyn.
   There are 3,300 vendors with permanent licenses and an
additional 1,000 allowed to sell food only in summer, according to
the Health Department.
   As Koch was at City Hall telling reporters, ``I'm not an enemy
of peddlers. I'm the friend of peddlers,'' the police unit hit the
streets.
   What did the police action mean to Michaelides, who's been
hawking hot dogs for 25 years, and whose father did it for years
before him?
   ``It means I've got two kids and I'm out of work now,'' said
Michaelides, whose spot on West 57th Street and Broadway is on the
city hit list.
   Ahmed Abelhady said he could not say what he would like to tell
the mayor, but ``it would not be nice.''
   Abelhady, who doles out chicken and beef sandwiches, said he
doesn't like the lottery system because it would force him to
change locations every year.
   ``I know my customers by name. I know what they like,'' he said.
``They're like friends to me.''

<HEAD>Federal Judge Strikes Down Georgia Abortion Notification Ruling _
Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Monday struck down a Georgia law
requiring minors to tell their parents before getting an abortion,
the second time in as many years the law has failed to pass
constitutional muster.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Hall granted a preliminary injunction
sought by Planned Parenthood to stop implementation of the Parental
Notification Act.
   The law, which requires girls under 18 to notify their parents
before getting an abortion, was to have taken effect July 1. Hall
had blocked its implementation pending his ruling.
   Hall voided a similar but more stringent statute last year after
the Atlanta and Augusta chapters of Planned Parenthood challenged
it, saying it placed too great a burden on teen-age girls.
   The law was rewritten to ease some requirements during the 1988
General Assembly, but the two Planned Parenthood chapters and
Atlanta physician Orrin Moore, who performs abortions, again
challenged it on virtually the same grounds. Their suit was filed
on behalf of more than 4,000 teen-age girls who received abortions
in 1985.
   Under the rewritten law, teen-age girls in some cases would have
had to wait 24 hours after notifying their parents for the abortion
to be performed. The lawsuit challenged that section and also said
the act failed to guarantee anonymity to some girls.
   The suit also challenged a provision of the law that allows a
girl to go to Juvenile Court to obtain a waiver if she does not
wish to notify her parents. The suit said the time involved in
getting such a waiver, sometimes three weeks or more, is too long.

<HEAD>Soviets Purchase Additional Corn From US</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
175,000 metric tons of corn from the United States for delivery
this year under a long-term supply agreement between the two
countries, the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 175,000 tons of
corn would be about 6.9 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.84 per bushel at the
farm level, meaning that the sale could have a farm value of around
$19 million.
   The corn is part of the grain the Soviet Union is committed to
buy during the fifth and final year of the agreement, which calls
for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of U.S. grain.
The pact expires Sept. 30, and there have been negotiations for a
new one.
   According to the agreement, the annual purchases are supposed to
include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The
Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as
wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two
tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.
   With the latest purchases, the Soviets now have bought 4.54
million tons of corn, plus more than 9 million tons of wheat;
830,700 tons of soybeans, and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal.

   Charles J. Cooper, assistant attorney general
in charge of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, is
joining the Washington office of the law firm McGuire, Woods,
Battle & Boothe, it was announced Monday.
   Cooper is to be a partner at the full-service Richmond,
Va.-headquartered law firm, the largest law firm in Virginia with
more than 300 lawyers in eight offices, the firm said in a news
release.
   Cooper will be a litigating attorney before federal agencies and
courts.
   In addition, Michael A. Carvin, Cooper's top aide as deputy
assistant attorney general for the legal counsel's office, also
will join the law firm's Washington office as a litigating attorney.
   Cooper has headed the Office of Legal Counsel for nearly three
years and before then worked in the department's civil rights
division for four years, where he worked closely with William
Bradford Reynolds, who has helped spearhead the Reagan
administration's controversial civil rights policies. Carvin has
been at OLC since May 1987 and before then spent four years in the
department's civil rights division.

   The Reagan administration said Monday that
U.S. participation in a century-old international accord could help
trim America's $2 billion annual loss to film and recording pirates.
   Assistant Secretary of State Eugene McAllister appeared before
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to argue for U.S. membership
in the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic
Works, created in 1886.
   ``Today we are experiencing a technolgical revolution involving
such innovations as computers, communications satellites, optical
discs and many more,'' McAllister noted. ``Many international
copyright experts here and abroad believe that the Berne Convention
is a comprehensive and dynamic instrument which meets the
challenges brought on by the new technologioes.''
   McAllister said the Berne Convention could protect U.S.
copyrights in 79 countries, 24 of which do not belong to the
Universal Copyright Convention. The United States is already a
member of that accord.
   Copyright official Ralph Oman testified that U.S.
representatives recently visited Turkey and Egypt with complaints
of pirating, but were told that since the United States did not
belong to the Berne Convention, U.S. rights were not legally
protected in those countries.
   Other countries on the list of 24 are mainly African, including
South Africa. Romania, Thailand and Uruguay are also among them.
   Oman said the list covers ``minor markets but major pirates.''
He did not further identify any of the pirating countries.
   He noted the spread of U.S. popular culture all over the world.
   ``For the first time U.S. films and recorded music now make more
money abroad than in the United States,'' he said.
   The House already has approved the bill for U.S. membership,
which now awaits action by the Senate.

   With few comparable parallels to go by, the
Reagan administration began work Monday on the ``huge job'' of
assembling the data necessary for compensating the families who
lost relatives aboard an Iranian airliner downed by a U.S. missile
last week.
   A State Department official said the task will be ``highly
discretionary'' because of the unique nature of the incident, in
which a U.S. Navy warship fired on the passenger plane after
mistaking it for an F-14 fighter.
   It is not clear yet, the official said, whether a flat amount
will be paid for each victim or whether the age, number of
dependents and earnings of the victims will be taken into account
in assessing compensation.
   Also to be determined is what role Congress will be required to
play in providing the funding, said the official, who briefed
reporters on the condition that he not be identified.
   ``We have a huge job ahead of us,'' he said. ``We have a lot of
facts to investigate.''
   The official said it is common practice in such incidents for
the government to seek a statement from the families of each victim
releasing the U.S. government from further liability for the
accident.
   He added that the outcome of a Navy investigation will not
affect the government's decisions on compensation.
   The decision to compensate was based on humanitarian concern,
the official said, adding that such issues as negligence or
culpability by either Iran or the United States will not influence
the process.
   The law does not specify a maximum amount the U.S. government
may pay in such cases.
   Besides Iran, citizens from six other countries werre aboard the
plane when it was shot down on July 3. The official said
compensation won't be based on the nationality of each citizen.
   Complicating the task for the administration is the absence of
diplomatic relations between the United States and Iran. The
official said the Red Crescent, an arm of the Red Cross that
operates in the Middle East, would be an acceptable organization
for making the payments.
   At least two of the precedents that could have a bearing on
amounts of compensation to be paid involve Israel.
   In 1980, Israel agreed to pay the U.S. government $6 million in
compensation for an attack by Israeli forces on an American naval
vessel at the outbreak of 1967 Middle East war. The attack on the
USS Liberty in the eastern Mediterranean left 34 American sailors
dead and 75 wounded.
   Like the Iran plane incident, Israel decided on an ``ex gratia''
payment _ meaning it was made out of sympathy but without an
admssion of fault or liability.
   There also was the case of the Israeli downing of a Libyan
passenger plane that strayed over Israeli territory in the early
1970s. Israel paid families of the victims $30,000 per person.
   In addition, the United States has compensated individuals for
damage done by troops on maneuvers in Central America, and is
paying owners of a fishing boat shot up by mistake in the Persian
Gulf.
   Iraq has agreed to pay compensation to the United States for an
incident in which an Iraqi jet, in another case of mistaken
identity, fired on the USS Stark in May 1987, leaving 37 sailors
dead. Negotiations are continuing.
   But the United States denied liability for damages to neutral
embassies in Tripoli, Libya, in a 1986 bombing raid. And similar
requests were turned down when neutral shipping was struck during
the bombing of Haiphong harbor during the Vietnam war.

   The blue and white banners hanging above the
passageways of the media village at the Democratic National
Convention are street signs bearing the names of the famous and
not-so-famous.
   Thomas Jefferson Avenue, Woodrow Wilson Boulevard and other
signs designate each major thoroughfare in the village that was
still being assembled Monday in the Georgia World Congress Center.
   The so-called streets run between trailers of electronic
equipment and blue-curtained makeshift newsrooms. There are no
traffic lights and pedestrians take their chances, stepping over
cables, dodging carts and scooters, ladders and lifts.
   ``We had a huge space,'' said Neel Lattimore, press gallery
supervisor for the DNC. ``So we had to come up with something''
that would enable convention staffers and media personnel to find
their work areas in about 339,000 square feet of exhibit halls.
   The village will accomodate approximately 13,500 reporters and
editors from about 125 news organizations during next week's
convention.
   Jim Thompson, manager of the general contracting firm for the
World Congress Center, suggested the passageways be named after
Democratic presidents, Lattimore said.
   That worked fine through Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman,
John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Jimmy Carter and even Grover
Cleveland, but then the media arrangements staff ran into a problem.
   ``We ran out of Democratic presidents,'' Lattimore said with a
grin.
   So the side streets are Myers Lane, Podrazik Lane and Lattimore
Lane _ named after himself and co-directors of media arrangements
Cindy Myers and Wally Podrazik.
   ``We take it very seriously, trying to make sure everybody gets
what they need, but this is kind of fun,'' Lattimore said.
   The street sign is the closest Lattimore, who works for a public
relations company in Washington, D.C., will come to fame during the
convention _ he hopes.
   ``Next Monday, if somebody knows my name, there's a problem,''
he said.

<HEAD>Planning For Health Care Costs Difficult</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Planning long-range expenditures for Medicare
and other health programs is similar to budgeting defense spending
in that it can be difficult to know what programs will work in the
future, a Democratic senator said Monday.
   ``It's sort of like new missiles in a pipeline,'' said Sen. Jay
Rockefeller of West Virginia. ``Will they work or will they not.
You're talking about what does and doesn't work (in health care)
and we don't necessarily know. ''
   Anticipating ``an avalanche of dollars for the future'' as both
public and private health care costs continue to rise, Rockefeller
proclaimed the matter of setting priorities ``a very scary
business.''
   His comments came after former Health and Welfare Secretary
Joseph Califano told a Senate panel that a growing body of research
is bearing out assertions of many analysts that ``at least 25
percent of the money we spend on health care is wasted.''
   That figure, said Califano, translates to $125 billion a year
and is likely to grow as the United States moves toward allocating
15 percent of its total gross national product to health spending
by the end of the next decade.
   As difficult and dangerous as it is to channel spending toward
medical practices with proven effectiveness, Califano said, ``The
greater danger of hurting people is if we don't embark upon a
program like this.''
   The exchange came as the Senate Finance health subcommittee
opened what is expected to be a protracted series of hearings on
ways to measure the quality of health care.
   Dr. William Roper, head of the federal agency that runs Medicare
and Medicaid, complimented Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, for
holding the hearings.
   Roper noted that Congress has approved his request for the
Health Care Financing Administration to use $10 million in Medicare
trust funds to devise better methods of relating quality medical
outcomes to costs. But he said that evolving field of research is
too big for the government to undertake alone and urged the
academic community to play a larger role.
   Califano, who headed what is now the Health and Human Services
Department under President Carter, said government health cost
containment measures to date have ``basically played musical
chairs, moving health delivery from this setting to that setting.''
   ``We're pretty much near the end of the road in that kind of
approach,'' said Califano, who is a private consultant to the
Chrysler Corp. and other major companies on health insurance.
   The next hurdle, said Califano, is to get a realistic handle on
which medical procedures are worth performing and which are not for
a particular patient.
   ``It's really doctors that have to make that determination,'' he
said.
   Califano ticked off several instances of drastic differences in
medical costs that apparently have no relationship to quality care.
   Three studies released in conjunction with the hearing concluded
that hospital mortality statistics released on the nation's 6,000
hospitals last December were not an accurate measure of the quality
of care given at those institutions.
   They particularly noted that the HCFA statistics did not account
for differences in the severity of illness among patients at the
various hospitals.
   However, Roper acknowledged at the time that the major
shortcoming on the data was lack of a severity of illness
adjustment. He said HCFA officials were studying a number of
alternative methods of injecting such a measure into subsequent
annual releases of the billing data supplied by hospitals.
   ``The main usefulness of this information is for doctors and
hospitals to look carefully at what they're doing and improve what
they're doing for Medicare beneficiaries,'' said Roper.
   ``It is also useful to consumers as a screening tool so that
they can pose useful questions, thoughtful questions for their
doctor or their hospital administrator. Consumers shouldn't use
this information on its own as a guide to picking a hospital.''

<HEAD>Senate Witness Says Noriega Bragged Of Bush Friendship, Drug
Traffic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In disputed Senate testimony, a convicted drug
racketeer said Monday that Panama's military strongman, Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, told him he planned to control the flow of drugs
through Central America and bragged of his ties to the CIA and Vice
President George Bush.
   The witness, John McCann, serving a sentence of life plus 110
years, told Senate Foreign Relations Committee narcotics
investigators that Noriega told him in a private 1983 meeting:
``I'm very friendly with the CIA, they let me do what I want.''
   McCann, who said Noriega conversed with him for nearly an hour
in halting English, added: ``He mentioned he was a very good friend
of the vice president, that he was the man responsible for holding
Central America together and keeping the communists out, and as
long as he did that he could do anything.''
   But some senators questioned McCann's account of a private,
detailed conversation in English with Noriega.
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., quoted both U.S. and former
Panamanian officials as saying Noriega always used interpreters
because his English is poor and not capable of sustaining a
lengthy, substantive conversation.
   McConnell quoted Michael Kozak, the State Department official
who conducted lengthy negotiations with Noriega after he was
indicted on U.S. narcotics charges as saying ``Noriega was not
proficient enough in English to conduct an intelligible
conversation.''
   McCann insisted that he had such conversations with Noriega on
four occasions between 1982 and 1984 and that while Noriega spoke
in ``pigin English,'' his meaning was plain.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who had led McCann through a detailed
description of narcotics dealings in Colombia, Bolivia, Panama and
elsewhere, asserted that McCann has no reason to lie and would be
subject to further punishment if he were convicted of perjury.
   ``I don't think I'd ever get out of jail for the rest of my
life,'' said McCann, who is serving his long prison sentence at the
federal correctional facility at Petersburg, Va.
   Responding to questions, McCann said Noriega may have overblown
any relationship he may have had with Bush.
   ``He told me he was friendly with Vice President Bush and I'm
sure he just said that to impress the point that he had friends in
high places,'' the witness testified.
   McCann said he had successfully sought help from Noriega in
assuring that shipments of cocaine through Panama were not
intercepted.
   He said he once offered the Panamanian general $250,000 in a
closed briefcase but that Noriega refused it, offering no
explanation.
   McCann testified that Noriega later told him to cut his ties
with drug rings in Bolivia, Colombia and other countries and to
deal exclusively with him.
   ``He said I could buy any of the things I wanted right in
Panama, heroin, cocaine, marajuana, antything,'' McCann said.
   The testimony came in the latest round of hearings led by Kerry
to explore the international narcotics racket and the effectiveness
of U.S. efforts to deal with it.

   A member of a peace group was arrested for
the second time in three days Monday when trucks laden with food
and medical supplies bound for Nicaragua tried to cross a bridge
into Mexico, officials said.
   Two vehicles were stopped by U.S. Customs officials when they
attempted to cross the bridge about 1:30 a.m., said Tess Koenig,
spokeswoman for the group calling itself the Veterans' Peace Convoy.
   Louis DeBenedette, the driver of one of the trucks, was arrested
after he refused to leave the bridge, Ms. Koenig said.
   ``He stepped out of the truck, they (police) handcuffed him and
he went to jail,'' Ms. Koenig said. The two trucks were then driven
back into the United States by other group members, she said.
   Convoy members have said they intend to leave the vehicles and
their cargo of food and medical supplies in Nicaragua, but federal
officials say the donation would violate a U.S. trade embargo
against the leftist Nicaraguan government.
   DeBenedette, 45, of Sparta, N.J., was charged with obstructing a
public roadway and bond was set at $500. DeBenedette told other
group members that he wished to remain in jail overnight rather
than post bond, said convoy spokeswoman Irene Rivera.
   DeBenedette was one of eight people arrested Saturday. He was
charged with obstructing a public roadway and resisting arrest. He
was released Saturday night on his own recognizance and fined
$1,250, Ms. Rivera said.
   The eight arrested had rushed a blockade set up by local police
and U.S. Customs officials.
   About 10 tons of supplies remain on the trucks and buses. Convoy
leaders say an additional 280 tons of supplies are being sent by
ship.
   The convoy originally tried to cross the border here June 15.

<HEAD>Transportation Board Urges Tighter Standards on Jetliner Brake
Wear</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air safety authorities on Monday urged that
the federal requirements for brake wear on large jetliners be
tightened to avoid future accidents such as one involving an
American Airlines DC-10 last May at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport.
   The National Transportation Safety Board said that eight of the
10 brakes on the American DC-10 failed when the pilot aborted his
takeoff after getting indications that the plane's flaps or slats
might not have been in the proper position.
   The jetliner with 240 passengers aboard skidded 1,000 feet
beyond the end of the runway, injuring the three cockpit crew
members and five passengers and extensively damaging the aircraft.
   The Federal Aviation Administration, responding to the NTSB
findings, said it agreed with the board's conclusions and is in the
process of developing new minimum requirements for brake wear for
all jetliners and possibly special directives for the DC-10.
   ``We have been following the matter (of revised minimum brake
standards for jetliners) closely since the accident at Dallas-Fort
Worth,'' said an FAA statement. FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said the
review is still ``in the early stages'' and no time frame for
implementing new requirements has been established.
   The pilot of the American DC-10 chose to abort his takeoff from
Dallas-Fort Worth on May 21 after an instrument indicated that the
plane's flaps or slats, which help the jet gain lift, were not in
proper position.
   A later examination showed they were in a position for takeoff
but that the warning signal was activated ``because of a slight
out-of tolerance condition'' involving one of the slats. The NTSB
urged that the warning system be redesigned.
   When the takeoff was aborted, the plane slowed as it should have
from 204 mph to 149 mph during the first six seconds, but the
safety board said ``at that point the deceleration decayed
rapidly.'' The jetliner left the runway traveling 117 mph, lost its
nose gear and plowed through the dirt for 1,000 feet before coming
to a halt.
   Eight of the plane's 10 wheel brakes ``were near the maximum
wear limits'' before the aborted takeoff and failed within 8 or 9
seconds after being applied, the investigators said.

   More Armenians returned to work Monday as a strike
called to press a territorial demand eased, but their southern
republic remained tense, Soviet media and a resident said.
   There were reports of police suppressing a protest demonstration
by Crimean Tatars in the Soviet republic of Uzbekistan.
   Many Armenians decided to return to their jobs because of
appeals by prominent cultural figures at a demonstration Sunday
night to use other means of protest, according to the resident, who
said he was a television reporter.
   ``They suggested meetings, open statements, but not strikes,''
said the resident, who declined to give his name in a telephone
interview from the Armenian capital of Yerevan.
   But other speakers at the rally called for a continuation of the
strike, the reporter and the official news agency Tass reported.
   Soviet newspapers said the walkout began July 4 and virtually
paralyzed Yerevan and other parts of the Armenian republic in the
Caucasus Mountains. Armenians have demanded the annexation of an
Armenian-dominated enclave in the neighboring republic of
Azerbaijan, Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Radio Moscow reported Sunday that public transport and many
factories resumed work in Yerevan. Tass said on Monday that tens of
thousands of Yerevan residents went back to their jobs and that the
overwhelming majority of enterprises had resumed normal operations.
   But Tass and the government newspaper Izvestia said the
situation in Yerevan remained tense.
   Izvestia said hundreds of thousands of people attended Sunday
night's rally. Some speakers harshly criticized Armenian delegates
to the June 28 Communist Party conference in Moscow for ``not
defending national interests,'' according to Izvestia. Resolutions
approved at the conference didn't mention the Nagorno-Karabakh
dispute.
   The legislature of Nagorno-Karabakh has voted to pull out of
Azerbaijan and join Armenia. Armenia's parliament has endorsed the
demand, but Azerbaijan's legislature has rejected it. Armenia and
Nagorno-Karabakh have asked Moscow to intervene.
   The television reporter said many Armenians are hoping a ``just
decision'' will be taken at a meeting he said many believe will
take place July 18 of the Presidium, or executive committee, of the
Supreme Soviet in Moscow. Government officials have announced
neither the date nor topic of such a session of the country's
legislature.
   ``The expectation is that a decision on Karabakh will be taken
in a just way. There are big hopes in the republic,'' the reporter
said.
   Ethnic rioting broke out February in the city of Sumgait in
Azerbaijan in February, and at least 32 people were killed.
   Crimean Tatar activist Reshat Dzhemilev said by telephone from
the Uzbekistan capital of Tashkent that police blocked roads
leading to the city over the weekend to block a demonstration
Sunday.
   He said about 2,000 Crimean Tatars gathered in Tashkent to
protest police actions during a rally in June and some
demonstrators were arrested Sunday but he did not have any figure.
   Crimean Tatars are demanding the right to return to their
homeland that is part of the Ukraine on the Crimean peninsula. The
late dictator Josef Stalin ordered all Crimean Tatars deported from
the area in May 1944, accusing them of betraying their country
during the Nazi occupation.
   The government dropped the collective war crimes charges in
1967, but the Crimean Tatars, who number about 300,000, have not
been allowed to return to the area.

<HEAD>Sugar Cane Workers Excluded from Residence Status Under Proposed
Rule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Monday published a proposed
regulation that would prevent thousands of foreign sugar-cane
harvesters from qualifying for permanent U.S. residence status
under a program for seasonal farm workers.
   The Agriculture Department published the proposed regulation to
comply with an order issued last month by a judge who found the
agency had procrastinated in revising rules he had previously
struck down.
   Last spring, U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan ruled that the
USDA had arbitrarily excluded sugar-cane workers from the seasonal
agricultural worker program.
   Under the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, seasonal
workers who enter this country to harvest perishable farm
commodities have until Nov. 1 to apply for permanent U.S. residency.
   Hogan, in ordering the USDA to redraft its regulations, said
that the department had not justified excluding sugar cane from its
list of perishable commodities and held the agency's definition of
vegetable was ``arbitrary and capricious.''
   In the response published in Monday's Federal Register, the USDA
stood by its previous position but produced a more extensive
definition of vegetable.
   It defined vegetables as ``the human edible herbaceous leaves,
stems, roots, or tubers of plants, which are eaten, either cooked
or raw, chiefly as the principal part of a meal, rather than as a
dessert.''
   The proposed regulation noted that ``sugar cane is not eaten
(cooked or raw) during the main course of a meal, either as a
principal dish or as a side dish.''
   ``While the juice of the sugar cane is digestible, the cane
itself is not digestible by humans,'' the USDA said. ``USDA is
unaware of the use of sugar cane as a vegetable as that term is
defined in horticultural science and in this proposed regulation.''
   The department also noted that `sugar cane did not meet the
definition of `other perishable commodities' because the production
of sugar cane does not involve critical and unpredictable labor
demands.''
   Opponents of the proposed regulation have until July 26 to file
comments with the USDA, according to the terms of Hogan's order.
   Steven Routh, an attorney representing two organizations that
help sugar-cane workers, said he was ``disappointed that the agency
has continued in its past pattern of taking action that's really
designed to keep sugar cane workers out of the ... program.''
   ``They start with the premise that they are going to keep
sugar-cane workers out and reason to that conclusion,'' Routh said.
``There has been a consistent, clear reluctance on their part not
to include sugar cane workers.''
   Routh vowed to return to court next month if the USDA does not
change its position.

   Maltese Prime Minister Eddie Fenech Adami,
seeking a better image for his Mediterranean island nation, opened
talks Monday with Reagan administration officials in a drive to
improve ties with the West.
   Apparently he is succeeding. After a meeting with Deputy
Secretary of State John C. Whitehead, a U.S. official spoke warmly
of Malta's desire to improve relations with the United States.
   ``The United States very much values its friendship with
Malta,'' said Thomas Switzer, a State Department press officer.
   The Maltese government, meanwhile, said in a full-page
advertisement in The Washington Post that military ties with Libya
would not be observed and links with North Korea reduced.
   Fenech Adami calls on President Reagan on Wednesday. It will be
the first meeting between a Maltese prime minister and an American
president in 19 years.
   Fenech Adami, a Christian Democrat, was elected last year after
16 years of Socialist rule. He said before leaving on the visit
that he wanted to repair a ``somewhat distorted'' image the United
States had of Malta during the Socialists' rule.
   Under former Prime Minister Don Mintoff, Malta strengthened its
bonds with Communist nations and with Libya, which the United
States has attacked as a supporter of terrorism.
   Mintoff also tried to persuade Europea rain fell at regular
monitoring stations of the National Weather Service. Forecasters
said an approaching Pacific front might bring thunderstorms, but no
steady rainfall was anticipated.

   Dry weather has evaporated at least half of the ``prairie

worst he's ever seen, said Dale Henegar, commissioner of the state
Game and Fish Department.
   ``A lot of the major marshes are dried up, and the birds paired
up early ... and just simply didn't nest,'' Henegar said. ``The
whole thing looks pretty grim.''

   Residents in drought-stricken areas may notice fewer mosquitoes
but more spider mites that attack house plants and landscape
shrubs, an entomologist said.
   ``Mosquitoes have to have moisture to be able to complete
development,'' said entomologist Jaime Yanes.
   The drought also affects fleas and ticks, but since they are not
dependent on water to reproduce like mosquitoes, they are stronger
in hot, dry conditions, Yanes said.

<HEAD>Ailing Duarte Returns and Vows To Complete Presidential Term</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte,
saying he is ``not cured, but strong,'' returned to El Salvador on
Monday and vowed to complete his term despite his terminal cancer.
   ``I am here now to reassume the presidency, in order to continue
working for what I most love: democracy,'' Duarte said in a brief
statement.
   Duarte, 62, arrived aboard one of the U.S. Air Force's
presidential Boeing 727 after an absence of nearly six weeks. He
left May 31 for diagnosis and treatment of cancer at Walter Reed
Army Medical Center in Washington, where he visited President
Reagan on Monday morning before flying home.
   ``President Reagan and President Duarte are personal friends,''
said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. ``The president
visited him in the hospital last week and invited him to the White
House on his departure for El Salvador.''
   Surgeons removed most of Duarte's cancerous stomach last month.
He then underwent chemotherapy to slow the advance of liver cancer.
Duarte's doctors have said he has between six and 18 months to live.
   Duarte's five-year term ends June 1, 1989.
   The president was leaner than when he left and his face was
somewhat drawn. But his step was firm and his embrace appeared
strong as he greeted Rodolfo Castillo Claramount, the vice
president and acting chief executive, and other officials on the
tarmac of Ilopango Airport outside the capital.
   He was greeted by an honor guard of paratroopers and the air
force band, and by members of the diplomatic corps.
   ``I certainly am not cured. But I am strong. I have the capacity
and the strength to carry out both the medical requisites my
disease demands and my work for the people,'' Duarte said.
   He promised to continue working with the military against
leftist guerrillas ``in order to bring peace to my people ... in
that way I will make it to the first of June and hand power over to
he who is elected by the people.''
   Duarte's governing Christian Democratic Party is in the deepest
crisis of its 28-year history. Each of two bitterly feuding
factions has nominated a presidential candidate.
   The rightist opposition won municipal and legislative elections
in March. The March voting outcome, along with the Christian
Democrats' internal problems, has created the impression that the
rightists could win the March presidential election.
   Fitzwater said in Washington: ``President Duarte simply wanted
to thank the president for his hospitality here and for the support
the United States has shown to El Salvador.
   ``Similarly, President Reagan commented on the outstanding
contributions that President Duarte has made to the growth of
democracy in El Salvador and the president expressed his
appreciation for all of his efforts in the regional peace talks.''

   U.S. investigators probing the Iranian
airliner tragedy want to know if an Iranian air force plane tried
to tell the jet it was being warned off by an American warship,
U.S. military sources said Monday.
   They said another question is whether the civilian air traffic
controller on duty at Bandar Abbas, which the Iran Air Airbus had
just left, heard the U.S. ship's radio messages but did not relay
them to the pilot.
   U.S. officials say the jetliner was shot down July 3, killing
all 290 people aboard, after it did not respond to messages sent by
the USS Vincennes on military and civilian radio channels. The
missile cruiser fired in the belief that the aircraft was an F-14
fighter threatening to attack, they said.
   The questions about the patrol plane, a U.S-built P-3 Orion, and
the air controller emerged on the sixth day of the inquiry by a
team of six U.S. officers.
   A U.S. source, who like the others spoke on condtiion of
anonymity, said: ``The inquiry is trying to look at everything. If
any attempts were made to alert the Airbus, they would of course
want to know that. It would be up to Iran to provide that kind of
information.''
   No indication has emerged whether the U.S. investigators would
have an opportunity to interview Iranian officials. A senior U.S.
officer here said last week it appeared ``highly doubtful.''
   It also was not known whether Iran would let U.S. investigators
review data from the jetiliner's ``black box'' flight recorder if
it is recovered.
   On Monday, they awaited the analysis of computer tapes from the
Vincennes and a second U.S warship that was in the Strait of Hormuz
at the time. The tapes were sent to the United States last week for
scrutiny at a Navy laboratory.
   The U.S. sources said the P-3 apparently was airborne in the
Hormuz area about the time the shootdown occurred, but said they
did not know how close it was or if it monitored the radio traffic
leading up to the Airbus' destruction.
   The P-3, a military version of the Lockheed Electra turboprop
aircraft, is used by the U.S. Navy for long-range anti-submarine
surveillance.
   Iran acquired six P-3s in the mid-1970s and at least one is
still flying, U.S. officials say. It is a familiar sight on almost
daily patrol missions over the Strait of Hormuz and southern
Persian Gulf.
   A British newspaper quoted the air traffic controller on duty at
Bandar Abbas the day the Airbus was shot down as saying Iranian
controllers hear U.S. warships issuing warnings on the radio
``every day,'' but ``we never reply to them.''
   The Times of London identified the controller as Hossein Pirouzi
and quoted him as saying, ``The Americans have no right to be in
the gulf challenging our legitimate right to fly our air routes _
so why should we reply to them?''
   The Vincennes remained at anchor of Bahrain as the investigation
continued. Its crew has been restricted to the ship for security
reasons, with sailors allowed ashore only in small groups to make
telephone calls home.
   Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty leads the investigating team, which
has a 15-day deadline U.S. officials said could be extended.
   The six officers, operating in secrecy, include a military
lawyer and technical experts. Most of the work is being done aboard
the Vincennes and the Navy's gulf flagship, the Coronado.
   One team member, Capt. John J. Kieley III, commanded the U.S.
missile frigate Reuben James in the gulf earlier this year and now
has a Navy staff assignment in the Pentagon.
   Navy sources said computer tapes from the Vincennes and the
frigate Elmer Montgomery, which was nearby, were vital to resolving
such questions as the altitude of the Iranian Airbus when it was
hit by two surface-to-air missiles.
   The Vincennes and Elmer Montgomery skirmished with Iranian
attack boats, sinking two, less than an hour before the Airbus was
shot down, U.S. officials said that might have helped make the
Vincennes' commander, Capt. Will C. Rogers III, believe his ship
was under air attack.
   Iran and Iraq have been at war since September 1980.

   President Reagan has chosen former
Pennsylvania Gov. Dick Thornburgh to replace Edwin Meese III as
attorney general during the remaining six months of the Reagan
presidency, a knowledgeable administration source said Monday.
   The source, who declined to be identified by name, said that
Thornburgh, a moderate Republican who once headed the Justice
Department's criminal division, had accepted the offer.
   Elsie Hillman, head of George Bush's presidential campaign in
Pennsylvania and a Republican National committeewoman, said in
Harrisburg, Pa., that she was told by Bush campaign officials that
Thornburgh had been asked to take the job. Thornburgh served two
four-year terms in the Pennsylvania state capital, Harrisburg.
   Thornburgh, who will turn 56 on Saturday, has been mentioned as
a possible running mate for Bush on the 1988 Republican
presidential ticket. His acceptance of the Justice Department post
would appear to rule out that prospect.
   Reagan told reporters earlier Monday that there would soon be an
announcement of a successor for Meese.
   The attorney general, under fire ever since his arrival in
Washington with Reagan, his longtime associate, announced his
decision to leave the Justice Department on the day last week that
independent counsel James McKay wound up a 14-month investigation
into Meese's ethical behavior in office.
   McKay's 830-page report has not been made public, but reportedly
he decided not to seek an indictment of Meese. That prompted the
attorney general to declare he had been ``vindicated.''
   Reagan said the same thing Saturday.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater declined to confirm or
deny that Reagan has settled on Thornburgh. Fitzwater said ``it's
probably likely that he (Reagan) has decided, but he has not made
an offer.''
   Cable News Network reported that Thornburgh had been interviewed
by White House general counsel A.B. Culvahouse.
   The first reaction on Capitol Hill was favorable.
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., one of those who recommended Thornburgh,
said, ``Dick Thornburgh is an excellent choice. He is an
outstanding administrator and a tough prosecutor. His integrity is
unquestioned. The Senate would be more than happy to strongly
support the governor.
   Sen. Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., a member of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, called Thornburgh ``a highly competent individual.''
   ``We first worked together in the wake of the Three Mile Island
nuclear accident,'' Simpson said. I saw him handle that with
maturity and skill. He dealt honestly with the issue, without
emotion or hysteria. He has a fine grasp of government.''
   Another member of the committee, Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.,
said Thornburgh ``has a fine reputation because of his leadership
in Pennsylvania. However, unless I have worked closely with
nominees in the past and know their capabilities, it is my practice
to reserve judgment until I have carefully reviewed their record.''
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said he did not know whether
Thornburgh had been chosen. But in a chat with reporters at the
White House after a meeting with Reagan on the drought, Leahy said
he did not think that Democrats would seek to block confirmation of
Thornburgh by the Senate.
   ``I don't think there will be anybody who will delay him based
on any partisan reason,'' said Leahy, also a member of the Senate
Judiciary Committee.
   ``There's only a half a year left in the president's term. If
he's named somebody new, we should move as quickly as we can on the
hearings,'' he said. ``There will be no partisan games played with
Mr. Thornburgh.''
   A Democratic source on the Senate committee, speaking on
condition that he not be named, said there was enough time for the
Senate to confirm Thornburgh. ``It's reasonable to think it's
doable this summer,'' he said.
   ``I would strongly urge that the background material on Mr.
Thornburgh get up to the Senate as quickly as possible,'' Leahy
said. ``I think it is essential for the Department of Justice, if
they're going to have a new attorney general, to have one as soon
as possible, and I think it's only fair to the people of the
Department of Justice to have a new leader confirmed as quickly as
possible.''
   White House chief of staff Kenneth Duberstein on Monday asked
Heinz for his view of a Thornburgh nomination, according to Heinz
spokesman Richard Bryers.
   Fitzwater said ``you know that names pop up, people weigh in,
and they have to go through background checks. So, we just have to
avoid these confirmations.'' The spokesman did confirm that Reagan
aides spent much of the weekend discussing whom to nominate as
Meese's successor.
   Thornburgh is no stranger to the Department of Justice. He was
the U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh from 1969 to 1975, then moved to
Washington as assistant attorney general and head of the criminal
division from 1975 to 1977. He served as governor from 1979 until
1987 and now directs the Institute of Politics at Harvard
University's Kennedy School of Government.
   Thornburgh was born in Pittsburgh and has an engineering degree
from Yale and a law degree, with high honors, from the University
of Pittsburgh. He and his wife, Virginia, have four sons.
   Fitzwater had said earlier that the administration wanted to
announce the nominee before Congress adjourns Thursday for the
Democratic National Convention. The convention begins Monday in
Atlanta.
   Meese, meanwhile, complained in St. Louis on Monday that a leak
from the independent counsel's report on his activity is ``not only
illegal, it's unfair.''
   McKay had been investigating Meese's assistance to Wedtech, a
Bronx defense contractor under investigation for payoffs to win
government contracts; his actions in connection with a proposed $1
billion Iraqi oil pipeline project; whether he took actions
favorable to regional Bell telephone companies at a time he held
$14,000 in telephone stock; and a $40,000-a-year job his wife took
from a foundation supported by a Washington real estate family that
leased office space to the Justice Department.
   On Saturday, the New York Times published a story that said
McKay's report show that Meese gave differing accounts of his
knowledge about a possible bribery scheme involving the pipeline
project.
   Meese, who was in St. Louis Monday for an FBI gathering, denied
that. Asked if he knew the details in 1985 of plans to pay the
Israeli Labor Party money from the pipeline project, Meese replied:
``No, I have no recollection of knowing anything about that.''
   Meese said he did not read closely a memo from his longtime
friend, E. Robert Wallach, in September 1985 mentioning the planned
payments to the political party.

   Prince Norodom Sihanouk announced his
resignation as president of the Cambodian guerrilla alliance
Monday, two weeks before the coalition is to open peace talks with
the Vietnamese and Cambodian governments.
   Sihanouk has made the same gesture previously, then returned to
head the fractious alliance of his followers, the radical communist
Khmer Rouge and former Premier Son Sann's anti-communist forces.
   On Monday, Sihanouk also said he was not abandoning efforts to
end more than a decade of war in Cambodia.
   ``No, I will continue my efforts to help my country and my
people,'' he said at the Bangkok airport as he left for Paris. He
said his son, Prince Nodorom Ranariddh, would replace him at the
talks beginning July 25 in Indonesia.
   Roland Eng, Sihanouk's spokesman, said the prince's decision to
resign as head of the coalition came so suddenly that everyone had
their bags packed for the trip to Indonesia. Sihanouk did not say
why he resigned.
   Eng said one reason was that the prince was upset by an article
Sunday in the newspaper The Nation detailing his relations in
Cambodia in the 1960s and 1970s with the Khmer Rouge and Son Sann.
   Sihanouk was deposed as head of state in March 1970 and the
monarchy abolished. The Khmer Rouge defeated the U.S.-backed
government of Lon Nol in April 1975, and independent observers say
more than 1 million Cambodians were killed under its regime.
   Vietnamese forces invaded Cambodia in December 1978, ousted the
Khmer Rouge and installed another communist administration. The
Khmer Rouge then began guerrilla warfare against the Vietnames and
were joined by forces loyal to Sihanouk and Son Sann.
   The Indonesia talks will be the first among the warring parties.
   Sihanouk was the central figure at the meeting last week of the
foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) and their Western partners. They said he should have a
major role in creating a new Camdobidan government.
   Among those at the meeting were Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda
of Thailand, Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Sosuke Uno,
the Japanese foreign minister.
   In a letter published in The Nation on Monday, Sihanouk objected
to allegations in an article that said his government forced
peasants to sell rice to the state at low prices in 1967. He said
the Khmer Rouge fomented the peasant-related violence of that year.
   The 65-year-old prince was asked at the airport if he would
change his mind again about resigning and said: ``No, I will not.''
   His resignation was announced in a statement issued from his
Bangkok office. It said: ``For serious reasons that are, for the
moment, impossible for me to enumerate and to explain, please allow
me today to resign as president of Democratic Kampuchea
(Cambodia).''
   Shultz, in Indonesia, said Monday he did not know how to
interpret Sihanouk's action. He said Sihanouk seemed in their
recent meetings to take a ``constructive'' approach to the
Cambodian problem.
   The foreign ministers of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, at a
conference Monday in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, declared they were
commited a political solution to the Cambodian conflict.
   In a joint communique, they repeated that all Vietnamese troops
will leave Cambodia by 1990 or sooner if a political solution is
reached, but the settlement must guarantee the Khmer Rouge will not
return to power. Vietnam has an estimated 140,000 military
personnel in Cambodia.

   Gov. Edward D. DiPrete said Monday he
would call a special session of the General Assembly if necessary
to restore a four-term congresswoman and a two-time gubernatorial
candidate to the ballot.
   After meeting with legislative leaders for more than an hour,
DiPrete said Republican Rep. Claudine C. Schneider and Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Bruce G. Sundlun should try to win their
ballot slots from the state Board of Elections before the
legislature would take action.
   But if the board rules against the candidates, or lawyers advise
that the board is likely to do so, the Republican governor said he
would call on the legislature to step in.
   ``I personally feel that both Bruce Sundlun and Claudine
Schneider should have their names on the ballot,'' DiPrete said.
``In the final analysis, if I have to call a special session, I
will.''
   Referring to Sundlun, DiPrete said, ``Even if he is my opponent,
I think he should be on the ballot.''
   Schneider and Sundlun face disqualification from the November
election because the signatures and addresses on their candidacy
declarations are not identical to those on their voter registration
cards.
   The Narragansett Board of Canvassers, which must certify a
candidacy, on July 1 discovered that Schneider's declaration
included her middle initial and listed her address as 56 Central
Ave. Her registration omits the initial and lists her address,
correctly, as 56 Central St. The canvassing board referred the
matter to the state Board of Elections.
   Sundlun signed his declaration with his initials and listed his
Providence address as 79 Prospect St. His registration spells out
his first name and omits the word ``street.''
   The Providence Board of Canvassers certified Sundlun's candidacy
despite the discrepancies. However, a political opponent checked
Sundlun's paperwork after the Schneider case became publicized and
complained to the election board.
   The state Board of Elections meets July 25 to determine if
Schneider and Sundlun may remain on the ballot. If the board rules
against them, they could launch write-in campaigns.
   Chairman Joseph R. DiStefano won't say what the board might do,
but said candidates have been disqualified ``time and time again''
for such mistakes.
   The law requiring signatures and addresses to match exactly has
been in effect since 1950 and has survived a state court challenge.
   House Minority Leader Bradford Gorham, who headed a commission
that extensively revised Rhode Island's election laws last year,
said, ``No one, absolutely no one, called for change in this
particular provision.''
   Schneider has served in Congress since 1980. Sundlun lost to
DiPrete in 1986.

   Negotiations began Monday toward ending
South Africa's 73-year rule over neighboring South-West Africa and
fixing a timetable for withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from
Angola.
   Officials from South Africa, Angola, Cuba and the United States
met privately at the U.S. Coast Guard base on Governors Island in
New York harbor on a way to send home all foreign troops in
southern Africa.
   South Africa has said it would accept a U.N. Security Council
resolution calling for the independence of South-West Africa, also
known as Namibia, when Cuban troops leave Marxist-ruled Angola. The
Cubans are fighting rebels supported by the United States and South
Africa.
   This round of talks is expected to end late Tuesday or early
Wednesday, said Anne Stoddard, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Mission
to the United Nations. Disagreement over a timetable for Cuban
withdrawal appears to be the most difficult unresolved issue.
   The U.S. goal is a complete pullout in one year, the same period
the U.N. resolution on Namibian independence allows South Africa to
give up control of that territory.
   Angola and Cuba have insisted the Cuban withdrawal be spread
over four years, but U.S. officials believe that is only a
bargaining position.
   Namibia lies between Angola and South Africa. South Africa
captured it from Germany in World War I and governed it under a
League of Nations mandate abrogated by the United Nations more than
20 years ago.
   In 1971, the World Court declared South Africa's continued rule
over Namibia illegal but the court, a branch of the United Nations,
has no enforcement power.
   The United States is a party to these talks because of the
support it has given Angolan guerrillas since 1985. Civil war has
plagued Angola since it became independent of Portugal in 1975.
   South Africa has repeatedly sent troops across the border from
Namibia into Angola to help the guerrillas and pursue guerrillas
from South-West Africa, and in recent weeks have fought Cuban and
Angolan forces in southwest Angola.
   Cuba has increased its troop strength there from about 37,000
soldiers last fall to an estimated 50,000, U.S. officials in
Washington say, but add they believe the buildup is an attempt to
strengthen its bargaining position.
   The U.S. officials say privately they are Angola's recent
acceptance of the principle of a total Cuban troop withdrawal.
   They also say the Soviet Union, which has provided Angola
billions of dollars worth of military equipment since 1975, has
shown interest in ending the conflict through a negotiated
settlement.
   The four parties first met in London in early May, then
reconvened late last month in Cairo, Egypt. South African and
Angolan officials held a separate meeting in May in Brazzaville,
Congo.

<HEAD>Reagan Goes To Bat For Nebraska Senator</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan went to bat Monday for the
re-election of the newest U.S. senator, Nebraska's David Karnes,
telling a Karnes fund-raiser that GOP presidential candidate George
Bush needs a Republican Senate he can work with.
   ``He needs a Republican Senate so our accomplishments of eight
years will not be undone,'' Reagan said.
   Karnes was appointed by Gov. Kay A. Orr last year to fill the
vacancy caused by the death of Sen. Edward Zorinsky, a Democrat.
   Addressing his remarks to the governor, who he said would see a
television picture of the event, Reagan said: ``Come election day,
people of Nebraska are going to confirm your wisdom in appointing
Dave Karnes to the Senate.''
   Karnes told the audience of about 200 that he had been
privileged to work in the Reagan administration as a White House
fellow in 1981-82 and that he learned ``we have true leadership in
this president.''
   The senator's opponent in November is former Gov. Robert Kerrey.
   The fund-raising event was held at a hotel two blocks from the
White House.

<TEXT>
   Texas oil troubleshooter Red Adair
inspected the burning Piper Alpha platform on Monday from a basket
suspended above the flames and smoke, but rough weather in the
North Sea halted his plans to clear debris.
   Chairman Armand Hammer and other officials of Occidental
Petroleum Corp., the platform's operators, rejected allegations
that warnings of gas leaks went unheeded in the days before
Wednesday night's disaster, which killed 166 of the 230 men on
board.
   Occidental executives have said they believe a gas leak caused
the explosions that rocked the structure 120 miles east of
Scotland, but have maintained the rig complied with all safety
standards.
   Police meanwhile released the names of two Americans involved in
the disaster. They said Carl Busse, 28, of Navasota, Texas, was
among those listed as missing and believed dead. Joseph Wells, 33,
from Santa Barbara, Calif., survived the blaze without injury, they
said.
   Hammer said the explosion was so powerful it overwhelmed the
structure's sophisticated safety system.
   ``Our oil rig had every safety device on it that we could
possibly have,'' Hammer said during a visit to Tel Aviv on Monday,
where he anounced plans for an offshore drilling project in Israel.
   About claims by former employees and families of survivors that
gas leaks discovered earlier were linked to the explosion, Hammer
said:
   ``Our people say that whatever leaks there were were corrected,
and they also were not in the place where we believe the explosion
took place.''
   He said the blast destroyed sensors and alarms before the
automated safety system could shut the platform down.
   ``We had sensors which would have detected ordinary leaks and
would have given us warning, but this explosion was so tremendous
that no sensors would operate there,'' Hammer told the news
conference.
   David Martin, president of Occidental Oil and Gas Corp., the
subsidiary which operates the rig, said in Aberdeen he had ``no
confirmation'' of any leaks prior to Wednesday's explosion but was
aware of reports that some workers had smelled gas.
   Adair, 73, and two assistants had to postpone plans to board the
platform when winds of 35 mph buffeted the site, said an Occidental
spokeswoman who would not give her name. Adair has worked on the
site since Friday and must clear the platform of debris to gain
access to the wellheads and seal them.
   About 30 percent of the debris has been cleared.
   The spokeswoman said the Houston disaster specialist and his
team returned to their base on the semi-submersible service vessel
Tharos.
   It was the second time in two days that Adair's efforts to work
on the platform were frustrated. He was forced to cancel a visit at
dawn Sunday because of heavy seas, high winds and flames shooting
into the air from one of the three wellheads still burning.
   In Red Deer, Alberta, a Canadian who was a former platform
superintendent on the rig, was quoted on Monday as saying the Piper
Alpha rig was ``a bomb waiting to explode.''
   ``I was glad to get off that thing,'' Ralph Miller of Red Deer
was quoted as saying by the Canadian Press news agency.
   Miller, who worked on the rig from 1980-82, said the problem
stemmed from the rig's productivity, according to the news agency.
   The Piper Alpha rig was one of the best producers at 120,000
barrels of oil a day and one of the most profitable in the British
section of the North Sea.
   Miller was quoted as saying that pressure to keep the oil
flowing led to lax maintenance, with valves sometimes not turning
and an inch or more of grease on some of the working decks.
   ``Basically, it went down to neglect. They had safety meetings,
but how much did it help?'' Miller was quoted as saying.

   Israeli soldiers fired on Palestinians hurling
stones at them in the occupied West Bank Monday, killing two
teen-agers and wounding 13 people, hospital officials reported.
   They said 15 Palestinians were treated for beatings inflicted by
Israeli troops.
   The death toll was the highest in the occupied territories for a
single day since June 16, when Israeli soldiers shot to death two
Palestinians and wounded 18 in the village of Beit Furik.
   In Arab east Jerusalem, Palestinian assailants stoned four
Israeli buses and firebombed a fifth. Police said a Palestinian
girl was injured by a stone, and two Palestinians were arrested on
suspicion of stone-throwing.
   Also on Monday, Economics Minister Gad Yaacobi said the
7-month-old Palestinian uprising has cost Israel more than $600
million, including losses in tourism, exports and production
revenues.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel has spent about $160
million to quell the disturbances in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
in which 220 Palestinians and four Israelis have been killed
according to U.N. figures. Israel captured the territories in the
1967 Middle East war. Israel's gross national product was $27
billion in 1987, including $1.6 billion from tourism. Tourism is
expected to lose about $300 million this year.
   Monday's worst clashes occurred in Nablus, the largest town in
the West Bank, where troops fired on a crowd of protesters.
   They shot 17-year-old Sares Anabtawi in the chest and the youth
died on his way to the hospital, officials at Al Ittihad Hospital
said. They said seven Palestinians were treated for gunshot wounds
and 15 for beating injuries.
   Officials at St. John's Hospital in Nablus said six Arabs,
including a 12-year-old boy, were treated for bullet wounds and one
man was in serious condition.
   Hospital officials had said earlier that 16 people were being
treated for gunshot wounds.
   Army officials said they had reports of one dead and nine
wounded, and were investigating whether they were shot by soldiers.
   An army spokeswoman said the disturbances erupted after the
funeral of an elderly Nablus resident who died of natural causes.
   When inciters spread rumors that the man was killed by soldiers,
Nablus residents poured into the streets, burned tires and stoned
troops, the spokeswoman said.
   After news of the death spread in Nablus, Palestinian youths
took to the streets, erecting barricades of burning tires and
throwing stones at soldiers, an Arab reporter said.
   The reporter, speaking on condition of anonymity, said clashes
raged throughout the city, and large numbers of soldiers were
rushed to the scene.
   In the West Bank village of Anabta, troops fired Monday on
students who hurled rocks and empty bottles at them after classes
were released, the army said. A 16-year-old student identified as
Hassan Addas was shot three times in the chest and killed,
according to hospital officials.
   The clash took place as schools reopened in the West Bank for
the first time in a week. The army had closed all 800 schools in
the occupied area, contending they were a focal point of
anti-Israeli riots.
   Also Monday, reserve Gen. Menachem Meron said the Arab uprising
was a threat to Israel's preparedness for combat with neighboring
Arab states.
   ``There is a risk that in time we will turn into experts in riot
control at the expense of combat readiness,'' Meron told the Itim
news agency. ``Does sitting in the territories contribute to our
combat readiness?''
   In another development, several Israeli Arabs suspected of
carrying out arson attacks on forests and farmland in Israel have
been jailed for six months each without trial, the daily Yediot
Ahronot reported.
   The Defense Ministry declined comment.
   Since the uprising began, the government has ordered more than
2,000 Palestinians from the occupied territories jailed without
trial, but such measures have rarely been taken against Israeli
Arabs.

   An aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on
Monday denied allegations by the American television network ABC
that Israeli security agents impersonated one of its news crews to
deceive and arrest a Palestinian.
   Israeli officials investigated and ``found no evidence that
Israeli security personnel impersonated ABC News persons in
arresting a Palestinian Arab'' last month, Avi Pazner told The
Associated Press.
   Pazner said he informed ABC News president Roone Arledge of the
results. Arledge sent a protest telex to Shamir last week demanding
an investigation.
   Dean Reynolds, ABC's Israel correspondent, said Monday: ``ABC
stands by its story. The facts were corroborated by informed
Israeli sources.''
   The network reported last week that Nizar Dakdouk of Salfit
village in the occupied West Bank was arrested by Israeli civilians
posing as ABC News personnel, and it had learned ``the impostors
were members of the Israeli secret security service Shin Bet.''
   Reynolds told the AP on Monday he was not satisfied with the
investigation and had asked Pazner which Israeli agency was
responsible for Dakdouk's arrest.
   ``Mr. Pazner acknowledged that the government didn't even ask
the central question of who arrested this young man,'' Reynolds
said. ``So much for a thorough investigation.''
   Pazner responded: ``The answer I got came from people
representing all the security services, and that includes the army
and the Shin Bet. This was a thorough investigation.''
   Reynolds said ABC learned of the incident June 26, two days
after it allegedly occurred, and complained to police, the army and
Shamir's office. It publicized the complaint last Tuesday because
it had not receive a satisfactory response, Reynolds said at the
time.
   According to the ABC News report, Israeli troops demolished
Dakdouk's home on June 16 on grounds he had thrown a firebomb at a
bus. The young man and his mother said on Israel television the
next day the army should have arrested him if he was suspected of
something, not blown up the house.
   A week after the appearance, Israeli civilians posing as an ABC
News crew arrived at the Dakdouk family's temporary home in two
cars and said they wanted to interview Dakdouk and his brother at
the site of the destroyed house, the report said. They agreed to go.
   One of the cars sped off with Dakdouk later and he was arrested,
ABC said.
   Since the Palestinian rebellion began Dec. 8 in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, Palestinians have claimed repeatedly that
Shin Bet agents patrol the territories in cars marked ``foreign
press'' and film protesters for purposes of identification and
subsequent arrest.
   Pazner said in his letter to Arledge: ``In the past, such and
other accusations have been circulated by Palestinians and ...
after investigations they were proved to be gross exaggerations or
pure fabrications.''
   Reynolds read the letter to the AP.

<HEAD>Report Says People Demand `Stern Measures' Against Officials</HEAD>

   Angry Vietnamese demanded ``stern
measures'' against officials after revelations that a food shortage
has made 10 million people hungry and caused 21 to die of
starvation, a Vietnamese newspaper said.
   In an exchange unusual even for communist Vietnam's current
spate of self-criticism, a group of voters in Ho Chi Minh City also
questioned the National Assembly's choice of a premier, the report
said.
   About 300 people attended a briefing July 2 by a delegation of
assembly deputies, it said. On June 22, the assembly chose
conservative Do Muoi to be premier instead of Vo Van Kiet, a
pioneer of of Western-style economic reforms.
   A text of the article in the July 5 edition of the newspaper
Young Age in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, was obtained Monday
from a Western embassy in Bangkok.
   It said Ly Chanh Trung, head of a delegation of assembly members
that met with the voters, criticized a newspaper report that Thanh
Hoa province near Hanoi enjoyed a bumper harvest and the food
shortage in the north had ended.
   ``This is not true,'' Trung was quoted as saying. ``According to
statistics released by the Council of Ministers, about 10 million
people faced hunger, 4 million people faced serious hunger and 21
people died of starvation in various northern provinces.''
   The Council of Ministers is the Cabinet the premier heads.
   According to the article, ``Many voter representatives were
shocked and became angry upon learning of this fact. They then took
turns to bombard the delegation with questions.''
   A man named Doan Ngoc Tu said: ``Stern measures must be taken
against leading cadres in charge of those localities because they
have failed to cope with the situation.''
   Nguyen Ba Nghe, of a liaison committee for the Industrialists
and Traders Association, said the government should let foreigners
invest directly instead of only through state agencies.
   ``Most of the voters' questions were about the election of the
chairman of the Council of Ministers,'' the article said.
   ``Some voters expressed their opinion as follows: `We need time
to judge the correctness of the National Assembly's decision.
Nevertheless, now that the National Assembly has made a choice, we
must ... join hands in seeking solutions to our current, very
difficult economic, political, and social problems.'''
   Previous official reports from Vietnam said the northern
provinces suffered food shortages and ``near-famine'' because
drought, cold weather, storms and insects devastated last year's
rice crop.
   Kiet, a deputy prime minister, told the National Assembly
session in June the food crisis became worse because the Council of
Ministers did not anticipate it and officials did not take urgent
relief measures.
   Reports in the official media say better harvests early this
year have provided more food for Vietnam's 63 million people, most
of whom live in the impoverished countryside.
   The U.N. World Food Program said June 24 it was sending $9.1
million in food aid to help 1.5 million drought victims in Vietnam.
It said U.N. officials confirmed a serious deterioration of food
supplies for 12 northern provinces.
   Vietnam appealed for more emergency aid but got little because
the policy of most non-communist countries is to isolate the
Vietnamese until they end their occupation of Cambodia, which began
with an invasion in December 1978.

<TEXT>
   The skipper of a U.S. trawler was
charged Monday with unlawful fishing and obstruction after Canadian
patrol boats stopped him from sailing off with four fisheries
officers who had ordered him into port.
   Roy Sheaffer, 39, of Edgartown, Mass., was ordered held in
custody until a bail hearing Wednesday. He did not have to enter a
plea.
   Sheaffer was charged with two counts under the Coastal Fisheries
Protection Act and a third charge of obstruction for refusing to
obey orders from fisheries officers to sail to a Canadian port.
   The 69-foot Mary Elizabeth was loaded with nearly 3 tons of
lobster and flounder when it was found inside Canada's 200-mile
limit, officials said.
   The incident began late Saturday when four Canadian officers
boarded the vessel, based in New Bedford, Mass., on the Georges
Bank fishing ground.
   ``The vessel was found fishing inside Canadian waters and a
boarding was carried out'' by the officers from a patrol boat, said
Bob Prier, regional enforcement director for the Fisheries
Department.
   Sheaffer refused to sail into Halifax and ``attempted to steam
away with four of our officers on board,'' Trade Minister John
Crosbie told Parliament in Ottawa.
   Another Canadian patrol vessel was nearby and caught up with the
Mary Elizabeth. Armed officers went on board and after some
argument arrested Sheaffer, according to Prier.
   ``He's a big man and it took a bit of time to get him under
arrest,'' Prier said. He reporteed there were no injuries.
   Fisheries officers in the area were issued with pistols and
submachine guns last year, and Prier said he doubted whether
Sheaffer would have been apprehended without guns.
   ``A year ago, it's likely the vessel would be heading into
Boston, not into Halifax,'' he said.
   Canadian willingness to use armed force against the Mary
Elizabeth should send a signal to other Americans tempted to fish
in Canadian waters, Prier said. ``They know we have the capability
now of arresting their vessels.''
   At least five American captains were convicted last year of
illegally entering or fishing in Canadian waters, mostly on Georges
Bank, an area of shallow water and lucrative lobster and scallop
beds.
   Sheaffer's three crewmembers, all from the New Bedford area,
were not charged and remained aboard their boat at a federal wharf,
according to officials.
   They said the vessel's catch of 1,700 pounds of lobster and
3,960 pounds of flounder was seized and sold to a local fish
market. The profit will be returned to Sheaffer if he is acquitted
or used toward fines and port charges if he is convicted.
   A conviction under the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act could
result in a fine of up to $750,000 ($622,500 U.S.) plus forfeiture
of the catch.

   Jesse Jackson told a farm group Monday that
all Americans will pay a price for ``the double disaster''
afflicting agriculture: the drought and Reagan administration
policies that have hurt family farmers.
   Jackson, who followed Vice President George Bush to the podium
at a meeting of farm broadcasters, editors and educators, said that
in the seven years of the Reagan administration, ``We've lost
600,000-plus family farmers _ the most efficient farmers in the
history of the world.''
   ``Something has gone awry when this many farmers are driven from
the land while we import food from abroad subsidized by the U.S.
government,'' Jackson told 450 people at the U.S. Agricultural
Communicators' Congress.
   He said the drought was not simply a farmers' problem but ``a
national crisis. It's a national security issue.
   ``All of us must bear the burden...of the double disaster: the
Reagan-Bush family farm policies and this lack of rain.''
   He charged the commodity markets were in ``a profiteering
frenzy'' and said, ``There is good reason to be concerned about
profiteering Pentagon-style'' on the part of mammoth agribusinesses
that could jump in and take over distressed farms.
   The audience included Earl Butz, the colorful and controversial
secretary of agriculture for five years under President Richard
Nixon, who told Jackson, ``You and I came from family farms. We're
part of the exodus....Why do we want to stop it now?''
   Jackson, a South Carolina sharecropper's son, said, ``We left
the family farm coming to get a job....Now the job is not there
either.''
   ``While we leave (farms), fewer insensitive corporations...own
more and control us more. That comes as a threat to me,'' said
Jackson, who called for an international conference ``to address
the implications of food distribution, prices and stability around
the world.''
   Jackson said farming, subject to drought, floods, bugs and other
calamities, cannot operate under classic free-market rules.
   ``Even Pharaoh in ancient Egypt knew that when the drought came
the rest of his system was in trouble,'' he said. ``A new system
was in order. A new vision was in order. New leadership was in
order.''
   Butz, who has an office at Purdue University and lectures across
the country, said afterwards that the farm population is shrinking
less now than it was in the 1960s and 1970s under both Democratic
and Republican administrations. He said he once heard Soviet leader
Leonid Brezhnev lament that 40 percent of his population was on the
farm.
   Butz said that when he was born 40 percent of the American
population was involved in agriculture. ``We'd be a nation of
peasants clear across the board today if someone had had that
philosophy then,'' Butz said.
   After addressing the farm group, Jackson met with Paul Brountas,
a top aide to Michael Dukakis who is coordinating the expected
nominee's search for a running mate.
   Jackson emerged from the meeting and told reporters that he
would accept the No. 2 spot on the ticket if it were offered.
   It was the first time he said publicly he would accept a vice
presidential offer. He has frequently pressed his demand for an
offer, but refused until Monday to say whether he would accept it.
   ``If it was offered to me, I would accept it,'' he said.

were deluged with a half-foot of rain.
   Temperatures approached the 100-degree mark and either broke or
threatened to break records for the date in several Eastern cities.
   The Big Apple again became the Baked Apple, as New York City hit
98 degrees, breaking a 77-year-old record by one degree. It marked
the fifth day in the last six that New Yorkers had to put up with
90-degree-plus heat.
   Newark, N.J., shattered its 98-degree record set in 1936 by
reaching 101 degrees Monday afternoon, the 16th day of 90
degrees-plus there this year.
   Other cities setting record highs for the date were Baltimore,
100; Bridgeport, Conn., 93; and Philadelphia, 100.
   But a cold front across the eastern Great Lakes should bring
relief from the heat to the Northeast and mid-Atlantic region, the
National Weather Service said.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered along the cold front
from northern New England through much of the Ohio and middle
Mississippi valleys into the southern Plains.
   Numerous thunderstorms produced locally heavy rain in parts of
south-central Texas, where rainfall measurements ranged from 3 to 6
inches. More than 6 inches of rain was measured just east of Hunt,
Texas, while areas west of Medina, Texas, received 6 to 7 inches.
   Rivers across much of the region rose by as much as 8 feet
because of the heavy rainfall. A flash flood watch remained in
effect Monday for much of south-central Texas. At least five
drownings were reported in Texas late Sunday and Monday.
   Elsewhere, more than 2 inches of rain was reported in parts of
Kentucky, resulting in some minor street flooding. Thunderstorms
also were reported from the lower Mississippi Valley across the
Southeastern states, and showers and thunderstorms were scattered
across parts of Nebraska and western Iowa. Other showers were
isolated in northern Idaho.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 56
degrees at Bellingham, Wash., to 102 degrees at McAllen, Texas. The
early-morning low in the nation was 36 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Tuesday, the weather service forecast scattered showers and
thunderstorms from the northern Rockies through the northern
Plains, the lower Missouri and middle Mississippi valleys, the
lower Ohio and Tennessee valleys, the eastern Gulf Coast and
Florida, and the Atlantic Coast. Scattered showers were also
expected in Washington state.
   High temperatures were predicted for the 80s or 90s across much
of the nation. Highs should reach the 70s along the Pacific Coast,
the Pacific Northwest, and much of the Great Lakes region, while
highs of 100 to 110 degrees were forecast in the desert Southwest.

<HEAD>Young Pilot Resumes Flight To Paris After Stop For Plane Repairs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old pilot left Montreal Monday on the
next part of his San Diego to Paris journey after his plane was
grounded for a day by mechanical trouble.
   Christopher Lee Marshall left Dorval airport at 2:42 p.m. EDT
headed for Wabush, Labrador, in a single-engine Mooney 252
two-seater, said Doug McGurk, a Transport Canada spokesman.
   The boy from Oceano, Calif., has said the trip will make him the
world's youngest transatlantic pilot and he wants to make the trip
to emulate Charles Lindberg's 1927 flight to Paris. One of his
other goals is to become the youngest pilot to fly around the world.
   The fifth-grade student and son of a commercial pilot is
accompanied by Randy Cunningham, 40, a retired pilot who served in
the Vietnam war. Cunningham limits the boy's flying time to less
than eight hours at a stretch.
   They are scheduled to fly to Greenland and Iceland before
arriving in Paris. The trip began in San Diego last Thursday.
   They had been scheduled to leave Montreal Sunday but were unable
to take off because a voltage regulator aboard the plane had to be
repaired.
   McGurk said the flight from Montreal to Wabush, at 21,000 feet,
would take nearly four hours.
   Lindbergh flew from San Diego to St. Louis, then to New York
before completing his 33{-hour non-stop solo flight across the
Atlantic Ocean to Paris.
   Christopher first took the controls of a plane at age four and
began flying with an instructor three years later.
   Last year he became the youngest pilot to cross the United
States. Tony Aliengena, a 9-year-old from San Juan Capistrano,
Calif., broke the record in April by making a
California-to-Massachusetts round trip.

<HEAD>British Prime Minister Chats Long-Distance With Soviet Citizens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher held a live radio
phone-in with Soviet citizens Monday on topics ranging from
``glasnost'' to household chores and invited a Leningrad schoolgirl
to visit her.
   Mrs. Thatcher fielded 15 calls during the 55-minute program
broadcast live to the Soviet Union on the British Broadcasting
Corp.'s Russian Service. The BBC said more than 200 Soviets called
in.
   Speaking in English translated simultaneously into Russian, the
prime minister was lavish in her praise for Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev and said she hoped the clock will not be turned back on
his policies of glasnost, or openness, and economic reform.
   ``I think that some things are irreversible, but I don't think
that they would go forward with anything like the same momentum if
Mr. Gorbachev were not there,'' she said.
   Moscow dissident Valery Senderov called to solicit her views on
the reforms Gorbachev has already implemented.
   ``I think it's remarkable that after 70 years of what I might
call the old-fashioned kind of communism,'' Mrs. Thatcher said,
``that Mr. Gorbachev should have been able to see that it was not
producing either the standard of living that people wanted or the
standard of social services.''
   To Moscow resident Karin Saakiyan, a Hare Krishna recently
released from a psychiatric hospital, Mrs. Thatcher expressed
optimism about religious freedom in the Soviet Union.
   Reporter Alexander Volkov of Radio Moscow's International
Department asked Mrs. Thatcher whether she still believed the U.S.
Navy was justified in shooting down an Iran Air jetliner on July 3,
killing 290 people.
   The Sunday Times of London reported a British intelligence
agency monitored radio communications in the Persian Gulf before
the incident and determined the plane was on course and climbing,
not descending toward the American warship Vincennes.
   Mrs. Thatcher said that while ``you will know many, many things
now that were not known to that captain,'' warships cannot be asked
to defend commercial ships unless they have the right to defend
themselves when they believe they are under attack.
   But she added:
   ``Yes, there will be times when they make a mistake and this
tragic accident ... underlines the need for an early end to the
Iran-Iraq conflict conflict including an end to all attacks on
shipping by both sides.''
   On a lighter note, Mrs. Thatcher told one curious inquirer from
Leningrad that she has no live-in help at the apartment she and her
husband, Denis, share at No. 10 Downing St. She told the man that
she does most of the cooking when they are not attending banquets
or official lunches.
   Schoolgirl Masha Kuznetsova called to invite young Britons to
visit her family in Leningrad, and was instead invited to meet the
British prime minister in London.
   ``Oh dear, if you come over and your school comes over, I will
ask our ambassador to let me know because I would like to see
you,'' Mrs. Thatcher said. Perhaps you'll come to No. 10 Downing
St. where I live. We'll look forward to a visit.''
   Edited highlights of the program were broadcast later Monday on
the BBC's English-language World Services.
   A BBC spokesman said that until January 1987, the Soviet Union
discouraged its citizens from listening to the BBC Russian Service
by widespread electronic jamming.
   An estimated 18 million people in the Soviet Union listen to the
BBC, company officials have said.

<HEAD>Senate Votes To Let Veterans Take VA Appeals To Court</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate, on the verge of passing a bill to
raise the Veterans Administration to Cabinet level, voted Monday to
let veterans appeal to the courts when their claims for benefits
are denied by the VA.
   The claims bill, passed on an 86-11 vote, also would repeal a
Civil War-era law that limits to $10 the amount a lawyer may charge
for pressing a veteran's claim.
   For several hours, senators debated a bill to create a
department of veterans' affairs as the 14th Cabinet department but
they put off a final vote until Tuesday. Passage of the popular
bill is virtually certain.
   ``Veterans ask only that their voice be heard at the Cabinet
table,'' said Sen. Frank Murkowski of Alaska, senior Republican on
the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee.
   The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, headed by Sen. John
Glenn, D-Ohio, concluded that elevation of VA to the Cabinet
``would best serve America's veterans, the American public and,
ultimately, the president of the United States through
strengthening of the Cabinet as a policymaking mechanism.''
   The Senate defeated an amendment that would have permitted
President Reagan to name the first secretary of veterans' affairs
immediately. Thus, the first appointment will be left to the next
president.
   The House already has voted to raise the VA to Cabinet level but
has refused four times in recent years to pass any bill allowing
court review of VA benefit decisions.
   Nevertheless, Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., chairman of the
Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, said, ``I think this time we
have enough momentum to get this (review) measure approved by the
full Congress.''
   The Senate rejected by a 61-36 margin an amendment by Murkowski
that would have allowed review only of VA regulations, not of the
agency's factual findings about a veteran's claim.
   The Senate-passed bill would permit a court to overturn an
adverse finding by the VA's Board of Veterans' Appeals only when
the court finds the decision ``so utterly lacking in a rational
basis in the evidence that a manifest and grievous injustice would
result if such finding were not set aside.''
   Allowing court review ``would raise veterans to full first-class
citizenship in the nation they fought so courageously to preserve
and defend,'' Cranston said.
   ``Why is it that food stamp recipients ... SSI (welfare)
recipients ... prisoners and those threatened by deportation can go
to court and veterans cannot?'' asked Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
   ``Does anyone, anywhere have evidence that the system is so
broken that without federal court intervention in thousands of
individual claims our veterans are going to be deprived of a fair
shake?'' asked Murkowski. He cited statistics that the Board of
Veterans' Appeals reverses up to 25 percent of claim denials and
said the bill would add about 4,500 cases a year to the nation's
backlogged courts.
   Cranston said the old law limiting attorney fees in VA benefit
cases actually works against veterans.
   ``Whatever behavior characterized the legal profession at the
time the original limitation was enacted following the Civil War
... it is no longer credible to insist that attorneys would prey on
innocent veterans,'' Cranston said.
   Voting against the court-review bill were: Sens. Christopher
Bond, R-Mo.; Orrin Hatch, R-Utah; Howell Heflin, D-Ala.; Richard
Lugar, R-Ind.; James McClure, R-Idaho; Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.;
William Proxmire, D-Wis.; William Roth, R-Del., Warren Rudman,
R-N.H.; Steven Symms, R-Idaho, and Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo.
   Sens. Joseph Biden, D-Del.; Jake Garn, R-Utah, and Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., did not vote.

<TEXT>
   A sociologist who was an adviser to the
banned trade union Solidarity died Monday from injuries sustained
in a mysterious assault nearly two weeks ago, colleagues and the
official media reported.
   Jan Strzelecki, who was about 60, was found June 30 in grave
condition lying near the Vistula River in Warsaw.
   According to police, he apparently had been dragged from his
car, beaten and thrown down an embankment, the official news agency
PAP reported.
   He never regained consciousness after the assault and died
Monday morning, said Ewa Haberka, an official of the Polish
Sociological Society.
   Although he was not a prominent member of Solidarity, Strzelecki
was an active supporter of it, said friends and other union
activists. He was employed as an associate professor and a
researcher for the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the
Polish Academy of Sciences.
   ``Evidence seemed to indicate that he had fallen victim to a
robbery assault, an especially brutal one,'' PAP said, adding that
an intensive investigation was continuing.
   The Polish Sociological Society has posted a reward of $2,325
for information leading to the arrest of the attackers.

   President Reagan, calling Americans ``a
compassionate people,'' said Monday the government will compensate
the families of those who perished in an Iranian airliner shot down
by a U.S. Navy cruiser.
   Without admitting legal liability for the loss of 290 lives when
Iran Air Flight 655 was downed July 3, Reagan said the payments
should be made on behalf of ``the innocent people who were the
victims.''
   There was no immediate indication how much money would be
involved, and a a State Department official said ``we have a lot of
facts to investigate'' before any payments are made.
   In Congress, whose approval apparently would be required, House
Speaker Jim Wright said lawmakers are likely to be sympathetic to
Reagan's request, but some members called the request premature
because of still-unanswered questions about the incident. Some said
compensation should be paid only after Americans being held hostage
in Lebanon are freed.
   In its announcement, the White House said there would be no
lowering of the U.S. military profile in the Persian Gulf. And
Reagan stressed that ``there's certainly going to be no
compensation'' for the Iranian government.
   On the eve of a scheduled United Nations Security Council debate
on the incident, the administration said ultimate responsibility
rests with ``those who refuse to end'' the Iran-Iraq war,
especially Iran ``which has refused for almost a year to accept and
implement Security Council Resolution 598, while it continues
unprovoked attacks on innocent neutral shipping and crews in the
international waters of the gulf.''
   ``We will not countenance any impression that this is a payment
to the government or an admission of liability or is in response to
any other external pressure or external international political
condition between our two countries,'' White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said.
   Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, Mohammad Ja'afar
Mahallati, said the U.S. offer was unsatisfactory.
   ``I have already stated that the proper term is `reparation,'''
Mahallati said. ``(But) reparation is not sufficient definitely
because the root cause of this tragedy and similar tragedies should
be removed from the Persian Gulf.
   ``And it cannot be anything less than withdrawal of U.S. forces
from the Persian Gulf.''
   Democratic presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson called Reagan's
offer ``the correct humanitarian expression.''
   ``It gives us the opportunity now, if Iran responds, to get Iran
and Iraq back to the table, to try to resolve and sign U.N.
Resolution 598 to reduce the tensions in the area, to allow us to
gracefully reduce our military presence in the area, and to maybe
have more U.N. presence in the area,'' he said.
   Amid conflicting reports about whether Iran recovered the flight
recorder from the downed A300 Airbus, the White House said anew
that Capt. Will C. Rogers III, commander of the USS Vincennes, took
``justifiable defensive actions'' to protect himself against feared
attack by an Iranian F-14 warplane.
   Fitzwater also said he wasn't sure whether the administration
would have to ask Congress to appropriate the compensation payments
but that it would not hesitate to do so.
   A State Department official who briefed reporters on condition
of anonymity said it was not yet clear whether a flat amount will
be paid for each victim or whether the age, number of dependents
and earnings of the victims will be taken into account in assessing
compensation.
   ``We have a huge job ahead of us,'' he said. ``We have a lot of
facts to investigate.''
   Reagan, asked whether giving compensation might send a bad
signal, said, ``I don't ever find compassion a bad precedent.''
   On Capitol Hill, Wright, D-Texas, said, ``If the president is
satisfied (that payments are warranted), I would imagine the
Congress would be satisfied.''
   But House Democratic Whip Tony Coelho of California, the party's
chief vote-counter, said he believed the request would ``have some
problems'' and said he was personally opposed to it.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a former prisoner of war in Vietnam,
said that as long as Americans remain hostage in Lebanon by
pro-Iranian elements, ``there will be resentment to any payment, to
any Iranian, under any circumstances.''
   Fitzwater made clear that the money would be channeled through
some third-party organization or intermediary, such as the Red
Crescent, an arm of the Red Cross, and not the Iranian government.
   He acknowledged that the U.S. government had not yet addressed
the question of how, and with whom, to verify the identities of the
dead or survivors who will likely make claims for compensation.
   All but 38 of the Iran Air passengers were from Iran. The others
were from India, Italy, Pakistan, Turkey, Yugoslavia and the United
Arab Emirates.
   During a picture-taking session with Salvadoran President Jose
Napoleon Duarte, who is recuperating from cancer surgery here,
Reagan told reporters: ``I, from the first, have said we're a
compassionate people and I think that we all have compassion for
the families of those unfortunate people who were on that plane.''
   The president said he understood a recent public opinion poll
showing a majority of Americans opposed the granting of
compensation, but said ``I think that they have tied that to our
feelings about the government and what it did with regard to our
people in the embassy there (in Tehran in 1979), when the Ayatollah
(Ruhollah Khomeini) came in (to power).''
   The administration left several questions unanswered. Fitzwater
said he had no idea of the amount of money to be offered.
   As the administration moved on the question of compensation,
there were these other developments:
   _The Khaleej Times in Dubai quoted unidentified salvage experts
in Dubai as saying the Iranians recovered the flight recorder from
the downed airliner in the past few days. But Iran's navy commander
said search teams had so far failed to find the flight recorder,
Tehran Radio reported.
   _With the Security Council convening Tuesday to debate the
incident, the United States, Britain and France were expected to
use their veto power as permanent council members to kill any
attempt to censure the United States.
   Fitzwater said he would not try to compare payments in Iran
airliner case with compensation the United States is seeking from
Iraq for its May 1987 attack on the USS Stark. Thirty-seven
American crewmen were killed.
   There have been reports that the United States is seeking $1
million for the families of each of those victims.

<TEXT>
   A congressman expressed concern Monday about
Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci's receipt of deferred compensation
year from a weapons contractor on whose board he once served and
which now is under investigation in the Pentagon contracting probe.
   Rep. Jim Florio, D-N.J., said Carlucci received the money in
March from the Detroit-based Unisys Corp., on whose board of
directors Carlucci served from 1984 through 1986. Carlucci, after
his appointment last year, disqualified himself from any decisions
involving Unisys.
   Florio, in a letter to Carlucci, wrote, ``While I understand
that this payment was deferred compensation, I am concerned that
such a payment to a secretary of defense who is in charge of
investigating the same defense contractor creates a serious
appearance of a conflict of interest.''
   The payment is explained on a financial disclosure form filed by
Carlucci in May as a ``deferred compensation plan for directors of
Unisys cashed out.''
   An earlier disclosure, filed in November, listed the value as
$82,482. The payment is dated in March, about four months after
Carlucci was reassigned by President Reagan from national security
advisor to secretary of defense.
   Carlucci also transferred into an insurance annuity an annual
pension of $14,300 due from Unisys, according to the disclosure
forms.
   Carlucci left the private sector in January 1987 to rejoin the
administration in the national security post.
   Florio said he questions if the payments _ originally planned
for after Carlucci left federal service _ are appropriate, given
Carlucci's post and the ongoing probe.
   ``I am concerned about the credibility of a secretary of defense
investigating a defense contractor who recently provided him with
compensation,'' Florio said.
   According to Pentagon officials, Carlucci himself is not
directly involved in the investigation of contract fraud.

   The first trial stemming from a reported
abduction and gang rape of a 19-year-old woman was postponed
Monday, after the prosecutor said he needed more time find
impartial jurors in this closeknit town.
   Many potential jurors in this southern Texas town of about 5,000
are related to the victim or defendants or have been exposed to
extensive media coverage of the woman who told authorities she was
kidnapped, raped and sodomized by as many as 20 men March 26.
   Assistant district attorney Rodolfo Gutierrez, the prosecutor,
said unrelated trials scheduled in the court would have forced the
case to be rushed, had it been tried this week.
   ``We'd be under pressure to finish this case this week, and we
just felt it was a little unrealistic at this point, because we
don't know how long it's going to take to select a jury,''
Gutierrez said.
   Orlando Garza and Corando Perez Jr., both 23, were to stand
trial on sexual assault charges Monday, but 229th Judicial District
Judge Ricardo Garcia and defense attorneys agreed to Gutierrez's
request. The date was moved to Sept. 12.
   The woman told police the assaults took place over a four-hour
period and began at a rural area north of town where a late-night
cockfight was taking place. Those at the cockfight, she said,
either ignored her pleas for help or joined in the attacks in the
back seat and on the hood of a car.
   Ten men were indicted April 11 on charges ranging from
kidnapping and aggravated kidnapping to sexual assault. The
prosecutor said some of the rape cases may be combined.

<TEXT>
   In this year's Midwest drought, a farm
newspaper found no shortage of dry wit when it asked its readers,
``How dry is it?''
   Blair Sawall of Clintonville said it was so dry that a certain
snack food company offered to buy his corn curls _ right out of the
ground.
   Dave Stowell of Burlington said his sweet corn was growing so
deep in search of moisture that the roots were being trimmed by a
fellow farmer _ in Australia.
   They were among more than 100 farm readers responding to the
question posed by the Wisconsin State Farmer newspaper as the
Midwest suffered through its most severe dry spell in years.
   John Naparalla of Neshkoro said it was so dry that the creek was
squeaking as it rounded the bends and the spawning carp got
sunburned.
   On a similar theme, Lloyd Kirsch of Gillett said it was so dry
that the baby frogs reached 4 months old and hadn't learned to swim.
   And Alan Cihlar of Mosinee said it was so dry that even the
dam-building beavers were joining farmers in applying for state
water diversion permits.
   Becky Kuehnel of Newton reported it was so dry there that:
   _Cattle exports are up, but so are camel imports;
   _No water spaniels were born this year;
   _And the futures market has a new category _ dried beef.
   A number of northern Illinois readers were also among the
respondents.
   For example, W.J. Hollad of Tiskilwa, Ill., reported his fields
were so parched that the milkweed went dry, the quack grass quit
quacking and the coffee weed wasn't making any coffee.

   Bail for singer Robert DeBarge, who faces
cocaine smuggling charges, was set at $50,000 Monday on the
condition that he be released to a residential drug treatment
center.
   ``We wanted him detained until trial,'' said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Steven G. Madison after U.S. Magistrate Joseph Reichmann
set bail. ``The defendant's own mother confirmed he has had an
ongoing drug problem since 1980 and said perhaps the arrest was a
blessing in disguise.''
   A hearing was set for July 22 on whether DeBarge should be
transferred to Michigan for trial. No trial date has been set.
   DeBarge, 32, who enjoyed success as a member of the singing
group Switch, and his 22-year-old brother, Jonathan, were indicted
last week by a Michigan grand jury that charged them with
conspiring to sell 2.2 pounds of cocaine brought to Michigan from
California.
   The two are members of a large Grand Rapids, Mich., family known
for both its singing talent and the legal troubles of several
members.
   The family's most famous brother, El DeBarge, was fined $100 and
ordered to perform 80 hours of community service after pleading no
contest to assault and battery charges in Grand Rapids in September
1986.
   Robert DeBarge was arrested in April 1986 after he allegedly
told a flight attendant on a flight from Chicago to Grand Rapids
that he was a terrorist and had a bomb. The charge was later
dismissed.
   Tommy DeBarge, another Switch member, received six months in
jail after pleading guilty to cocaine possession in March 1986.

   Prime Minister David Lange was
discharged from a hospital Tuesday morning after a 10-day stay
during which he underwent a minor heart operation.
   Lange's office issued a statement saying he would convalesce at
his Auckland home before returning to work in Wellington next week.
   Lange, 46, was admitted to Green Lane Hospital in Auckland on
July 2 after suffering chest pains.
   Doctors found a narrowing of a coronary artery and operated last
Tuesday. A surgical balloon was maneuvred to the trouble spot and
inflated, widening the artery.
   Deputy Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer has been acting as prime
minister.
   Lange, of the Labor Party, appeared in good spirits upon leaving
the hospital and posed for photographers.

   Congress is likely to be receptive to
President Reagan's request for compensation to families of those
killed in the U.S. shootdown of an Iranian airliner, House Speaker
Jim Wright said Monday.
   But some lawmakers called the request premature because
unanswered questions remain about the incident, and others
continued to call for release of U.S. hostages in Lebanon as a
requirement for any aid. Wright's chief Democratic vote-counter
said approval of the aid was far from a sure thing.
   Offering payments to the bereaved survivors of the 290 victims
would be ``a voluntary act committed by a nation that is both
generous and genuinely regretful'' of the incident, Wright,
D-Texas, told reporters. He said he expected quick action once
Reagan formally makes a request of Congress.
   ``If the president is satisfied (that payments are warranted), I
would imagine the Congress would be satisfied,'' Wright said.
Leading members of the congressional foreign policy and defense
committees have spoken out in favor of making such payments.
   But it was unclear whether approval could be taken for granted.
House Democratic Whip Tony Coelho of California, the party's chief
vote-counter, said he believed the request would ``have some
problems'' and said he was personally opposed to it.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said as long as Americans remain as
hostages in Lebanon, ``there will be resentment to any payment, to
any Iranian, under any circumstances.'' He said he believed Reagan
had made the offer as an emotional response to the downing of the
jetliner.
   The bipartisan leadership of Congress was scheduled to meet with
Reagan on Tuesday, and the compensation issue was expected to be
high on the agenda.
   Wright said it is important that the gesture not be seen as an
acknowledgement of guilt and that it not be routed through the
Iranian government, either of which would make it tougher for
Congress to swallow.
   The administration has emphasized that the compensation would be
distributed through non-governmental channels in Iran.
   A national Washington Post-ABC News poll last week found that 61
percent of those surveyed opposed the idea of paying compensation
and an even greater majority, 71 percent, believed the captain of
the USS Vincennes was justified in firing the missiles that downed
the commercial A300 Airbus.
   But Wright said he believed that was a misleading reading based
on early impressions that payment of compensation would somehow be
an apology to the Iranian government or an admission of U.S.
liability.
   ``It is a different proposition the way in which I think the
president stated it,'' he said.
   Several members of Congress have said the payments ought to be
linked to the release of American hostages being held in Lebanon by
radical factions said to be under Iranian control.
   McCain said letting the hostages go ``would show the Iranians
are interested in peace and concerned about the lives of innocent
human beings.'' He said the payments ``will be perceived as a
payoff to Iran, whether we like it or not.''
   But Wright said there should be no attempt to link the two
issues. ``That would appear to be a form of ransoming our hostages,
which we have refrained from doing,'' he said. Because the payments
would be made directly to bereaved families, no
government-to-government conditions could be attached, he added.
   The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., said his reaction to the president's announcement was
``generally positive,'' but that payment should hinge on whether
the Persian Gulf becomes a safer place.
   ``The actual payment should be made in connection with the end
of the (Iran-Iraq) war or at least the end of attacks by Iran and
Iraq on innocent shipping in the gulf,'' he said.
   Coelho was skeptical about the president's request. ``I'm not
inclined to provide payments to Iranians,'' he said. ``I want to
know who is at fault and everything about it ... Maybe we have
another secret Iran-Contra deal working. I don't understand why
they're trying to move it along.''
   It remained unclear precisely what legal authority would be used
to make the payments, or how they could be negotiated and arranged,
since the United States has no diplomatic relations with Iran.
   But Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., noted that ``if you are
interested in paying money, it's not hard to find a way.'' He said
he supported Reagan's proposal to ``show the Iranian people that
the people of the United States are a just society and that the
propaganda they get from their government about the United States
is false.''
   The payments would be what lawyers call ``ex gratia'' _ made
voluntarily without admitting guilt or liability. Under
international law, nations have no legal liability for damages
caused as a result of war or hostilities.
   But some administration advisers have been concerned that the
United States not be likened to the Soviet Union, which refused to
make compensation after shooting down a Korean Air Lines passenger
plane over the Sea of Japan in 1983, according to congressional
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.

contracts involve six projects at nine companies.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon, acting Monday on an earlier
announcement by Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, banned two
companies and three individuals from doing business with it as a
result of the military procurement investigation.
   At the same time, the Defense Department lifted the suspension
of contract payments on six military projects involving nine
companies that Carlucci on July 1 ordered frozen based on evidence
from affidavits in the case unsealed by a federal court in Dallas.
   Contracts on the nine programs were valued in excess of $1
billion, although work on some of the contracts had already been
completed.
   In a related action, the Pentagon said the Navy ``initiated
action to suspend without pay George Stone,'' a contracting
employee who allegedly passed along information that may have
helped several companies submit winning bids on military programs.
Carlucci had already announced that step.
   And ABC News reported Monday night that a woman who worked in
the office of former Assistant Navy Secretary Melvyn Paisley says
she was ordered to make copies of classified documents by a senior
military aide to the former Pentagon official. Paisley has been a
target of the procurement probe.
   ``I said ... this is wrong. We're not supposed to be doing this.
We're not supposed to duplicate classified material,'' the
unidentified former staffer told the network.
   She said she copied the documents on the directions of Paisley's
executive aide Capt. Robert Toll.
   ``Absolutely false,'' said Toll, who is now retired, in denying
any copying of classified documents.
   ABC also said that William Galvin, a defense consultant whose
name has also surfaced in the investigation, often visited Paisley
at his Pentagon office but staff members did not note the visit on
the official logs.
   Announcement of the banning actions came the day before Carlucci
was scheduled to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee
to explain what actions he was taking on the basis of his July 1
announcement.
   Carlucci's comments surprised some Navy officials, some members
of Congress and contractors who have sought to determine exactly
which payments and contractors were involved. Some of the affected
programs involve dozens of subcontractors, and the legal
implications of Carlucci's action was unclear.
   The two companies that were suspended were Varian Continental of
Dallas and Acquisition Control of Alexandria, Va., the announcement
said. The three individuals were Mark Saunders, Thomas E. Muldoon,
and Joe Bradley.
   The department resumed payment to Unisys in a $712 million
anti-submarine warfare program; to Litton Industries in a $150
million program to develop a handheld digital radio transmitter;
TRW on the anti-submarine warfare program; ITT on a $51 million
fiber optics program; Continental Electronics on a $6.3 million
very low frequency transmitter; Loral Terracom and Canadian
Commercial on a $49 million radio program; and Hughes Aircraft and
Raytheon Corp. on a $38 million carrier combat direction system.
   Earlier Monday, Charles Bowsher, head of the congressional
General Accounting Office, told the Senate Armed Services Committee
that Carlucci should hold off on suspending contracts or debarring
contractors while the probe is under way.
   ``It might be better to let the investigative process work,''
Bowsher said. Later, if there are indictments, those contracts
could be suspended and if there are convictions, the contractors
could eventually be debarred, he noted.
   When he suspended the payments, Carlucci was under political
pressure to demonstrate that he was working to clean up the
military procurement system, widely criticized as a result of the
investigation.
   Carlucci, in his announcement on July 1, said he had initiated
suspension procedures against Stone, Saunders, Bradley and the
Continental Electronics division of Varian Associates Inc.
   According to the affadivits released a day earlier, FBI agents
eavesdropped as Stone read to Saunders, a consultant, the secret
bids from 10 companies competing for a $120 million Advanced
Tactical Air Command and Control system. Payment on that project
was resumed Monday.
   Saunders is a former Navy procurement officer convicted of and
fired for stock trading on insider Navy information in 1982. The
FBI said Saunders was receiving inside contract data from Stone,
his Navy successor, and it ``believes that Saunders is paying Stone
for this information.''
   Stone was one of six Pentagon officials transferred to other
duties after their offices were searched.
   Bradley was placed on administrative leave from his job as vice
president for marketing of Varian Continental, of Palo Alto,
Calif., according to a company spokesman.
   Muldoon, a former employee of the Unisys plant in Great Neck,
N.Y., later set up his own consulting firm in Washington with
clients including Litton, Hazeltine and Emhart. According the
affadavit unsealed in Dallas, Muldoon paid Saunders $4,000 out of
an $8,000 monthly retainer from Litton in exchange for contract
information.

<HEAD>U.N. Envoy Fears Upsurge In Afghan Fighting</HEAD>

   U.N. special envoy Diego Cordovez said Monday
there could be a brutal intensification of the war in Afghanistan
after the scheduled pullout of half of the Soviet military
contingent by Aug. 15.
   At a news conference after returning from his latest trip to the
region, Cordovez appealed anew for a Sept. 1 cease-fire and
establishment of a new Afghan government without Soviet-backed
President Najib and including political leaders from both sides of
the conflict.
   Cordovez said his mission is to solve a ``very serious political
impasse'' and he noted divisions among the various groups in the
seven-party Afghan guerrilla alliance.
   After mid-August ``there could be a very brutal intensification
of the military confrontation'' in the 10-year-old civil war, the
diplomat said.
   Cordovez made the cease-fire proposal in Islamabad, Pakistan, on
Saturday after separate talks with Afghan, Pakistani and Iranian
officials and with Soviet military commanders in Kabul, the capital
of Afghanistan.
   He did not meet with Afghan guerrilla leaders, who have vowed to
continue fighting until the government is toppled.
   His trip was aimed at resolving administrative and technical
problems involving the implementation and monitoring of the Afghan
accords that were signed in Geneva last April.
   Cordovez said he received assurances from Soviet and Afghan
officials that U.N. observers deployed under the agreement will
have access to Afghan airports to watch Soviet troops leave.
   The agreement calls for withdrawal of all Soviet troops by Feb.
15, with the first half to leave by mid-August. It includes
Afghan-Pakistani pledges of non-interference and for a safe return
of Afghan refugees. There are about 3 million refugees in Pakistan
and hundreds of thousands in Iran.
   The Soviet Union sent troops into Afghanistan in December 1979
to help the Marxist government battle the Islamic, anti-communist
guerrillas and has had an estimated 115,000 military personnel in
the country.

   Riot police used tear gas and water
cannons Monday night to scatter hundreds of anti-government
demonstrators who staged a ``March of Hunger'' to protest the
military regime's economic policies.
   Five buses were set afire, police said. A bus driver and a
firefighter were badly burned and were hospitalized in serious
condition, the official news agency Orbe said.
   About 200 demonstrators were detained, Orbe reported. It said
one police officer and five demonstrators were injured, none
seriously.
   The march was called by several communist-controlled
organizations of slum dwellers and joined by hundreds of other
demonstrators, most of them students.
   Police fought running skirmishes with the protesters for almost
three hours. Scattered groups of demonstrators were repatedly
dispersed by police, but quickly regrouped at a different
intersection to resume their protest.
   The demonstrators blocked traffic, sometimes with flaming
barricades, at a number of busy downtown intersections, as
thousands of office workers returned home from work.
   Earlier in the day, a dozen bombs went off at various points in
this capital city of 4.5 million people, causing damage but no
victims, according to police.

   Kentucky's governor blasted the federal government Monday for
being too slow in dealing with the drought, and Iowa's governor
warned that farmers there still face potential disaster despite up
to 5 inches of rain over the weekend.
   Crews began installing pumps on barges Monday to haul fresh
water to southern Louisiana towns plagued by rising salt levels in
the lower Mississippi River, which has been so weakened by the
drought that salty seawater is forcing its way inland.
   A cold front brought showers and lower temperatures to parts of
the Midwest and Plains, but a heat wave lingered in the East. New
York City hit a record 98 degrees, its fifth day in six of highs of
90 or better, and downtown Baltimore reached a record 102.
Connecticut's Department of Environmental Protection said air
quality was unhealthful to very unhealthful.
   Meanwhile, the hot, dry weather has brought big-city smog to the
countryside from Maine to Georgia during the past two weeks, a
Pennsylvania State University professor said Monday.
   Accumulated city pollutants _ mostly from car exhaust _ have
spread across the region, at times pushing ozone levels beyond
federal air quality standards, said John M. Skelly, a professor of
plant pathology who researches the effects of air pollition and
acid rain on forests.
   Much of an area from Maine to Georgia and as far west as Chicago
recorded ozone levels higher than 120 part per billion for 10
straight days ending Friday, he said.
   A reading of of more than 120 for one hour on two consecutive
days violates U.S. Environmental Protection Agency air quality
standards. Levels of 100 or higher can cause shortness of breath,
raspy throats, sore eyes and irritated mucous membranes.
   In Washington, House Speaker Jim Wright said he hopes a drought
relief package with disaster payments of up to $100,000 per farmer
will win committee approval and be ready for floor action in
Congress this week. He said the bill being drawn up would make
farmers in more than 1,880 counties in 37 states that have been
called disaster areas eligible for payments.
   Officials said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is still weeks
away from deciding whether more Great Lakes water should be
diverted to the Mississippi for barge traffic. That is opposed by
most Great Lakes governors and the government of Canada.
   The drought could even force dozens of Kentucky's small
thoroughbred horse operations out of business because it is forcing
up the price of oats and hay, an industry official says.
   In addition, dusty, dry fields cause more respiratory problems
for horses, resulting in higher medical bills, says Nick Nicholson,
executive vice president of the Kentucky Thoroughbred Association.
Kentucky has about 4,000 horse farms and in 1986 public auctions of
horses generated $520 million.
   Some parts of Iowa got up to 5 inches of rain over the weekend,
but totals of about one-half inch were more common.
   ``We're certainly not out of the emergency situation,'' Iowa
Gov. Terry Branstad said. ``Some of the corn crop has already been
severely damaged. They're going to have to have additional moisture
in the very near future, the next 10 days or so.''
   Branstad said farmers who have private crop insurance should be
eligible for public aid programs, even though they'll receive
partial payment for their losses from that coverage, to encourage
more people to get such protection.
   Widespread rain has alleviated the drought across Louisiana but
means only a partial recovery, Agriculture Commissioner Bob Odom
told the Louisiana Farm Bureau Federation convention Monday.
   Of about 700,000 acres of cotton planted across Louisiana, he
said, an estimated 100,000 acres will be abandoned or plowed under
and replanted in soybeans. That could mean a loss of $35 million to
$40 million, he said.
   Hundreds of Kentucky's city and county officials met Monday to
hear predictions that the drought could get worse.
   Because so much ground moisture already has been lost in
Kentucky, ``a return to normal rainfall won't break the drought,''
said state climatologist Glen Conner. ``Severe or extreme
conditions likely will persist through September.''
   Kentucky Gov. Wallace Wilkinson scored Agriculture Secretary
Richard E. Lyng and the U.S. Department of Agriculture for saying
it was too early to determine how much crop yield had been lost.
   ``I don't think Washington has acted strongly or swiftly
enough,'' Wilkinson told reporters. ``Anybody who couldn't
determine that yields have been damaged before now shouldn't be in
agriculture.''
   Parts of Ohio got scattered light rain Monday, the first to fall
this month. Mercer County extension agent Earl J. Beiler told of
two farmers within five miles of each other near Rockford who
reported widely varying amounts.
   ``One had two-tenths (of an inch) and the other had
seven-tenths,'' Beiler said. ``As dry as it is, the seven-tenths
will probably get down and do some good, but the two-tenths is
hardly enough to wash the dust off.''
   Not everyone suffers from too little water.
   Three to 6 inches of rain fell on parts of Texas, flooding some
low-lying roads. Verde Creek reportedly rose 7 feet and the weather
service said the Llano River's north fork near Roosevelt swelled 22
feet.

   The National Trust for Historic Preservation
asked a federal magistrate Monday to stop the demolition of a
historic warehouse district where a food company wants to build a
$50 million corporate headquarters and research complex.
   The trust, a group calling itself People for Responsible Omaha
Urban Development and others want an injunction preventing ConAgra
Inc. from leveling the Jobbers Canyon warehouse district.
   The hearing before Magistrate Richard Kopf was expected to last
a week.
   The 20-acre district near downtown and the Missouri River
consists of turn-of-the-century warehouses and is on the National
Register of Historic Places. Several buildings in the district
already have been razed.
   Steve Achelpohl, who represents the trust, argued that plans for
the riverfront development project should be subject to approval of
the Interstate Commerce Commission, the National Park Service and
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
   He said the federal agencies must approve various aspects of the
project, including railroad track abandonment and changes in flood
control procedures.
   But assistant U.S. attorney Paul Madgett, who represents the
federal agencies, moved for dismissal of the case, saying the
agencies weren't involved in the project and there was no
indication any federal money would be involved.
   Kopf took Madgett's motion under advisement.

<TEXT>
   Heavy rain sent creeks and rivers raging out
of their banks Monday in central Texas, drowning at least one
motorist and stranding others after killing four other people in
the western part of the state.
   In the central Texas Hill Country, Kerr County authorities
searched for a 33-year-old man missing after a truck was swept away
by the rapidly rising Guadalupe River near Hunt. The body of his
13-year-old brother was found about 100 yards downstream.
   The river had risen 21 feet by midafternoon near Hunt,
destroying piers and docks at summer camps along its banks.
Barrels, picnic tables and small rafts floated downstream. But the
waters were receding late in the day.
   Authorities did not release the names of the dead boy or his
missing brother. A third person in the truck, Dan Knight, escaped
harm after vain attempts to save his companions.
   The flooding came nearly a year after 10 teen-agers drowned when
the church bus and van they were in was swept away by the Guadalupe
river near Comfort.
   Sgt. Mike West of the Kerr County sheriff's office said that all
campers seemed to be safe this time. ``A lot of the camps are more
alert now because of what happened last year,'' he said.
   Farther west, Cipriano Enriquez Rodriquez told Pecos County
authorities that he and four family members were caught by flooding
in Perkins Draw late Sunday while driving a state highway to Del
Rio.
   The draw normally is a dry creekbed, but up to 8 inches of rain
Sunday caused flash floods, officials said.
   Rodriquez, 47, of San Jose, Calif., survived by clinging to a
tree overnight, then walked about 4 miles to Sheffield, said Pecos
County Sheriff Bruce Wilson.
   His wife, son-in-law and two grandchildren drowned, officials
said. Their bodies were found Monday morning.
   In the central Texas incident, Knight said he tried to help his
two companions, whom he declined to identify.
   ``I got the both of them (out of the truck) and I put them on my
chest,'' he said. ``In the water they don't weigh that much. We
floated about a half-mile down to the bend and I was still holding
to them. A log hit my head and arm pretty hard and I had to let
them go.''
   ``He risked his own life to save them,'' said a witness, Evelyn
Hickey. ``He had made several attempts at the boy, but the other
man pulled them down. When he couldn't help them anymore, he got
out a long way down stream.''

   U.S. Secretary of State George P.
Shultz said Tuesday the expulsion of the U.S. ambassador and seven
other American diplomats from Nicaragua was an `` absolute
outrage.''
   Shultz made the remark when reporters asked him to comment on
the expulsions, ordered by the leftist Sandinista government on
charges that U.S. Ambassador Richard Melton and the seven others
were undermining the Managua government.
   ``Well, it's an absolute outrage,'' Shultz said of the expulsion
order. He did not say what action he planned to take.
   ``When they talk about destabilizing Nicaragua, it's the
government of Nicaragua that's detabilizing Nicaragua because of
the way they are conducting themselves, including, just yesterday,
breaking up a rally with tear gas and things of that kind,'' Shultz
added.
   The expulsion order came a day after police in Nicaragua clashed
with thousands of anti-Sandinista demonstrators.
   Shultz arrived in Manila Monday for talks with President Corazon
Aquino and other officials. Shultz's 36-hour visit in the
Philippines is his fourth stop on a nine-nation tour of Asia.

<HEAD>Black Families Enter South Boston Project Without Incident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two black families moved into apartments in a
formerly all-white housing project without incident Monday as
authorities kept bystanders and the media at a distance.
   Boston police watched as movers carried furniture and belongings
into the three-story brick buildings at the South Boston project,
which has been without black tenants for more than 10 years.
   South Boston, a predominantly white neighborhood, was the scene
of racial violence when public schools were integrated under a
federal court order more than a decade ago.
   The families were granted three-bedroom apartments as part of an
emergency Boston Housing Authority program.
   The move, however, was unconnected to an integration plan
affecting 31 of Boston's 69 projects. The plan by Boston Mayor
Raymond L. Flynn and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development seeks to provide subsidized housing for an estimated
500 black families passed over for placement in South Boston and
the city's Charlestown section since 1983.
   City officials hope successful implementation of the plan will
stall a lawsuit by minority groups.
   Boston police spokesman James Jordan said authorities have a
``public safety plan'' for the South Boston project, adding,
``should anything happen, the police response would be virtually
immediate. It's an intensive plan, but with a low visibilty as far
as uniforms are concerned.''
   ``I'm no pioneer,'' said one of the new black residents, Bessie
Payne, on the eve of the move. ``I'm just almost a homeless person
_ and I don't like that feeling at all. I'm looking forward to
making a new home and getting my life straightened out again.''
   Many residents watching the families move in said the black
families would not encounter problems from neighbors.
   ``I really think the press has blown it out of proportion,''
said 18-year-old Kelly Manion, watching movers carry furniture
through a doorway decorated with shamrocks. ``We'll get along
together. In fact, it just might be good for the people living
here.''
   Another neighbor, who refused to give her name, said: ``It's
just like any family moving in. They won't be treated any different
than anyone else new to the project.''
   But Julie Jellow was less optimistic about tranquility in the
project. Jellow, 29, said she has received threats and abuse
because of her two children fathered by a black man.

<HEAD>Appeals Board Again Asserts Its Jurisdiction Over Postal Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A General Services Administration appeals
board on Monday reiterated its contention that it has jurisdiction
over a Postal Service contract with Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot
and ruled that it will hear complaints about the contract.
   The Postal Service maintains the GSA does not have authority
over the contract, but on Friday suspended its contract with Perot
because the GSA's Board of Contract Appeals had ordered the pact
suspended.
   ``The Postal Service continues to believe that the contract
appeals board does not have jurisdiction,'' said Jim Van Loozen, a
spokesman for the Postal Service.
   But ``we would hope that they would now bring those matters to
some conclusion ... and rule promptly on those protests,'' Van
Loozen added.
   At least two competitors of Perot had complained to the
contracts board about the pact, under which Perot agreed to study
ways to improve the agency's efficiency.
   Van Loozen said the contract dispute concerns whether the Postal
Service complied with the Brooks Act, a law outlining contracting
procedures for most federal entities.
   ``We have already agreed that we did not comply with the act.
The postal reorganization act of 1970, that set up the Postal
Service as an independent agency, gives us specific authority to
contract for ourselves,'' said Van Loozen.
   The agency last week asked the federal appeals court to rule on
whether the GSA contracts board has jurisdiction over its
activities. No date has been set for that hearing.

   UNITED NATIONS _ The Security Council convenes Tuesday to debate
the shooting down of an Iranian airliner by a U.S. warship, and
Iran wants the Americans condemned for killing the 290 people
aboard.
   The United States, Britain and France are expected to use their
veto power as permanent council members to stop any censure
resolution or demand that the U.S. fleet leave the Persian Gulf.
   Requesting the debate is a turnabout for Iran, which has
boycotted council sessions for years because, it says, the
15-nation body bows to pressure from Washington and is biased
against Iran in the 8-year-old war with Iraq.
   It was not clear Monday whether a resolution would be presented
for a vote. Iranian officials have said they seek condemnation of
the United States and a demand that the U.S. Navy withdraw.
   The White House announced Monday that President Reagan has
approved U.S. compensation for the families of the 290 people who
died aboard the Iranian jet. Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
amount of compensation had not yet been decided upon and the
payments could be subject to congressional approval.

   Pool tables have appeared on sidewalks all over the city in a
craze that participants attribute to television coverage of a

   Never mind that many of the tables tilt or rock slightly because

not.
   In a city where most residents flee their tiny, hot apartments
on summer evenings and mahjong and card games are the only

<HEAD>Chinese University Students Come under Increased Stress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLENE L. FU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As China rushes into economic and social change,
its university students are coming under increasing stress and
pressure to achieve. Officials have begun to offer them
psychological counseling.
   ``Competition, of course, brings more stress to students,'' said
Chen Chongkeng, director of the clinical psychology section of
Beijing University's psychology department.
   At one time under the Chinese communist system students were
assured of a plum job after graduation, but today's students are
told to start looking for employment on their own, and many find
the competition tough.
   A college education also used to be free, with the state picking
up the tuition and giving students a monthly subsidy. But students
soon will have to start paying at least part of the cost.
   Some school authorities are beginning to realize the effect
these changes can have on students, and are providing counseling
services.
   The centers are also part of China's changing attitude toward
psychology and mental health.
   During the ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, all
psychological work ceased, and psychologists were told their field
was ``unscientific.''
   Now, psychology has returned to most major universities and
hospitals. Self-help mental health books are best sellers.
   In 1986, an All-China Youth Mental Health Conference was
convened, and teachers and delegates agreed that psychological
problems among college students was an area of concern, Chen said.
   In this capital, four schools, including the prestigious Beijing
University, have set up counseling centers. At least 30 colleges
and universities nationwide are providing similar services.
   The counseling center at the Beijing Post and Telecommunications
College, started in 1985, has treated 1,224 students, according to
the English-language newspaper China Daily.
   ``College students have many psychological problems which affect
their studies,'' said Wang Yan, a specialist in children's
emotional disorders at Beijing University. ``China is just
beginning to work on mental health, and college students seem to
have the greatest psychological problems.''
   One Beijing University senior told a Chinese newspaper that he
feels ``just like a small boat sailing into the tempestuous sea
with little psychological preparation.''
   Some of the problems are not unusual or serious.
   Chen, who heads the counseling center at Beijing University,
said they rarely see serious cases of mental disorders in the
students who come to the center. Inability of new students to
adjust, and relationship and romantic problems are most common.
   However, some extreme cases have been reported.
   _An 18-year-old freshman at Qinghua University, China's most
prestigious technical school, committed suicide last summer after
failing an English exam.
   _Liu Yong, a senior at Beijing Aviation College, killed himself
last summer after murdering a female classmate. Newspaper reports
said he became emotionally unstable after reading the philosophies
of Jean Paul Sartre and Nietzsche, and the writing of French
novelist Emile Zola.
   The counseling centers provide a much-needed service, Chen said,
but he was critical of their use of what he called ``common sense''
psychology.
   Many of the centers are staffed with well-meaning teachers or
other school personnel who have little training in psychology, he
said.
   By contrast, the clinic at Beijing University is made up of four
people from the psychology department.
   A session with one of the psychologists costs 2 yuan (54 cents).
When the center opened two years ago, treatment was free and four
to five students came every day. However, financial concerns forced
the professors to begin charging for their services this year.
   Chen calls their treatment method ``collective,'' meaning that
they use all methods and schools of psychology, including Freudian
psychotherapy.
   ``We use whatever is suitable for the patient,'' he said.

<HEAD>Poland's Health Care System in Critical Condition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Room 890 in the intensive care unit of the
Banacha Street hospital is spacious and clean. Its neurological
unit has four new heart-monitors and state-of-the-art respirators.
   But it has not had a patient in the last two years.
   ``We have equipment worth tens of thousands of dollars, but we
don't have the zlotys to pay the nurses so the equipment goes
unused,'' said Dr. Andrzej Friedman, a neurologist at the hospital.
   Around the corner, other rooms in the hospital are so crowded
that critically ill stroke patients are kept on beds in the
corridor, a sight typical in many Polish hospitals.
   Forty years after the communist government promised its citizens
free and adequate health care, the system itself is in critical
condition.
   Poles must pay at every stage for decent care.
   Shortages of supplies requires, for example, the
re-sterilization and re-use of disposable needles, intravenous
plasma units and catheters.
   At the same time, Poles in general aren't careful about their
own personal health. They are among the world's heaviest smokers
and drinkers and their diet is high in animal fat.
   The state-run health service, however, puts a low priority on
preventive medicine.
   ``The main difficulty now is the organization of the system and
the enormous bureaucracy. We are short of everything but we could
do better with what we have if the system were better organized,''
said Dr. Zofia Kuratowska, a health adviser to the banned
Solidarity trade union.
   The problems start with hospital buildings. Three-fourths are
more than 50 years old, according to a 1987 World Bank study, which
concluded that half of the oldest hospitals should be replaced
because they cannot be modernized.
   One government solution has been to invest in such huge, modern
showcases as the Health Center for the Polish Mother in Lodz, a
polluted industrial city in central Poland whose residents are
among the country's least healthy.
   The center's attractive working conditions have drained doctors
and nurses from other facilities.
   ``They (the government) are making these monument buildings that
are a real idiocy because they will serve only a few people,'' said
Friedman.
   Diagnosis appears to be one of the weak links of the health
system. CAT-scans to assess brain damage can take two weeks to
process and X-ray film is often faulty.
   ``In our hospitals the machines only work a few hours a day,''
said Kuratowski, the Solidarity adviser. ``People wait weeks for
simple procedures, blocking beds in the hospital, and sometimes
it's very dangerous.''
   She heads the Social Foundation for Workers' Solidarity
established by the union to help administer a $1 million grant it
received last year from the U.S. Congress. The foundation hopes to
establish three diagnostic clinics in Warsaw, Gdansk and Krakow,
but plans have been delayed because the government has yet to
officially register the foundation.
   Being a doctor or nurse is not financially rewarding. At
mid-career a doctor earns about 30,000 zlotys ($69) a month and
nurses 18,000 zlotys ($41), less than the national average of
42,000 ($97).
   ``Because of the salary a lot of doctors are trying to emigrate
or thinking about it,'' said Kuratowska. ``A young doctor does not
make enough money to create a stable life for his family.''
   As a result, some take money on the side, she added.
   ``People in hospitals must pay for just about everything and
very often, unfortunately, the doctors take money as a bribe.''
   The cost to patients often runs high.
   Admission to some Warsaw maternity wards is 100,000 zlotys
($232); complicated cancer or heart operations can cost 500,000
zlotys ($1,162).
   And once a doctor has made a diagnosis, the patient must try to
find medicine, which though inexpensive by Western standards is in
chronic short supply.
   The government allows private or cooperative clinics to take
some of the pressures off on the state system, but treatment is
expensive. A tooth extraction in a private clinic can cost 15,000
zlotys ($34), more than one-third of the monthly wage.
   Although the government plans to reform the health system, it
appears reluctant to endorse reforms that ideologically would
threaten the concept of socialized free medicine.
   Kuratowska believes Poles should be allowed medical insurance so
they can recover some of their costs.
   That, she said, would make things more equitable in a
free-health system where people must pay anyway.

   Today is Wednesday, July 20, the 202nd day of 1988. There are
164 days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On July 20, 1969, Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin
``Buzz'' Aldrin became the first men to set foot on the moon.
Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface at 10:56 p.m. EDT and
proclaimed, ``That's one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for
mankind.'' Aldrin followed 19 minutes later and said, ``Beautiful,
beautiful. Magnificent desolation.''
   On this date:
   In 1810, Colombia declared its independence from Spain.
   In 1861, the Congress of the Confederate States began holding
sessions in Richmond, Va.
   In 1871, the Canadian province of British Columbia entered the
Canadian confederation.
   In 1881, Sioux Indian leader Sitting Bull, a fugitive since the
Battle of the Little Big Horn, surrendered to federal troops.
   In 1917, the draft lottery in World War I went into operation.
   In 1942, the first detachment of the Women's Army Auxiliary
Corps _ later known as WAC _ began basic training at Fort Des
Moines, Iowa.
   In 1944, an attempt by a group of German officials to
assassinate Adolf Hitler failed.
   In 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was nominated for an
unprecedented fourth term at the Democratic convention in Chicago.
   In 1951, Jordan's King Abdullah Ibn Hussein was assassinated in
Jerusalem.
   In 1960, a pair of Polaris missiles was fired from the submerged
USS George Washington off Cape Canaveral, Fla., at a target more
than 1,100 miles away.
   In 1976, America's Viking I robot spacecraft made a successful,
first-ever landing on Mars.
   In 1977, a flash flood hit Johnstown, Pa., killing 80 people and
causing $350 million worth of damage.
   In 1982, bombs planted by the Irish Republican Army exploded in
two London parks, killing eight British soldiers, along with seven
horses belonging to the queen's Household Cavalry.
   Ten years ago: Dr. Peter G. Bourne, the White House expert on
drug abuse, resigned one day after admitting writing a prescription
for a potent sedative to a fictitious name. Hours later, President
Jimmy Carter told a news conference he'd accepted Bourne's
resignation with regret.
   Five years ago: The U.S. House of Representatives censured two
of its members, Illinois Republican Daniel Crane and Massachusetts
Democrat Gerry Studds, both of whom admitted having had sexual
relations with teen-age congressional pages. ABC-TV anchorman Frank
Reynolds died in Washington at age 59.
   One year ago: The UN Security Council voted unanimously to
approve a U.S.-sponsored resolution demanding an end to the Persian
Gulf war _ a move supported by Iraq and dismissed by Iran.
   Today's birthdays: Actress-singer Sally Ann Howes is 58. Video
artist Nam June Paik is 56. Actress Diana Rigg is 50. Singer Kim
Carnes is 42.
   Thought for today: ``A very great part of the mischiefs that vex
this world arises from words.'' _ Edmund Burke, British statesman
(1729-1797).

<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>

   The Social Security fund is developing a surplus
and, like any big bundle of public money, it is also creating a
political controversy.
   Should the funds be used to finance new spending programs?
Should the Social Security tax be reduced? Should the fund be left
alone to build assets for financing retirements in the next century?
   With the surplus projected at $37 billion in the current fiscal
year, rising to nearly $500 billion by 2015, some analysts view it
as the savior of a nation wracked by budget deficits.
   Like a spendthrift who thinks money is wasted if it isn't spent,
some politicians are busily devising plans for new governmental
programs that may or may not have merit, and that otherwise
wouldn't have funds either.
   And some, such as Peter Ferrara of the Heritage Foundation, warn
that the growing surplus is but a temporary thing, a consequence of
young workers paying in big amounts that, inevitably, will be
needed when their retirements come.
   ``The disappointing truth is, Social Security surpluses will
become large deficits in about 25 years,'' says Ferrara, a fellow
in political economy at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative
Washington-based think tank.
   As with others, Ferrara expresses almost no faith in the
judgment of politicians presented with large sums of money, to wit:
   ``If policy-makers assume that such surpluses will eliminate
federal budget deficits and pay off the national debt, they are
likely to abandon attempts to balance the budget, spend billions of
dollars of anticipated revenue that they will never receive, and
plunge the nation into financial catastrophe.''
   Not everyone sees it that way, and some have credentials.
   A.B. Laffer and Associates, a California consulting firm, states
that under current law, projected annual Social Security surpluses
will produce budget surpluses for 20 years or more by 1994. Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., has spoken glowingly of the
surplus and its possibilities.
   Ferrara disagrees. An analysis such as Laffler's, he says, fails
to add any adjustment for inflation or other variables, or for the
effect of economic growth over time. This, he says, leaves a
``badly distorted impression.''
   For at least the next two decades, however, the fund's surpluses
should grow, simply because the youth bulge _ baby boomers, if you
choose _ will be working its way through the economy, paying in
more than it takes out.
   But when they begin to retire, says Ferrara, they will create a
demographic wind shear. By his estimates, all the Social Security
trust funds together will begin adding to the federal deficit in
the year 2013.
   An analysis by J.P. Morgan & Co. expresses similar fears. Rather
than spending, it suggests productive investment of the surplus can
promote domestic savings and investment, and help control the trade
and budget deficits.
   Ferrara would repeal the Social Security payroll-tax increase
made in January and the boost due in January 1990.
   He argues that not only are the increases not needed at this
time, but that eliminating them would tend to add jobs to the
economy that would actually increase Social Security revenues and
finance benefits to be paid in the 2000s.
   He suggests also policy-makers should allow participants the
choice of substituting private savings and insurance accounts for
future Social Security benefits.
   To do so, he contends, ``could reduce reliance on Social
Security in the future sufficiently to avoid the need for any tax
increases, and even possibly create sufficient room for further
payroll tax relief.''
   Morgan recommends partial privatization of the surplus, that is,
allowing contributors to the Social Security system to divert a
portion of their payroll tax to Individual Retirement Accounts _
IRAs _ so as to maximize the return.
   This public debate is only beginning. It has at least a decade
or more to go, and it probably will heat up each year as the
surplus grows.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Here's a bookstore for the cloak-and-dagger set,
one of Washington's best-kept secrets, a reservoir of reading
material for would-be spooks and espionage fans. Understandably,
most of the customers of the National Intelligence Book Center
prefer to remain anonymous.

<TEXT>
   Psst! Tucked away on the sixth floor of a
downtown Washington office building is a bookstore for spies, where
you can learn how to change your identity, determine if your
telephone is bugged, look inside the KGB or get some self-help
guidance on becoming an agent.
   But you almost have to engage in espionage to find the National
Intelligence Book Center, which specializes in books, magazines,
computer software and tapes on spies, cryptography, surveillance,
the CIA, the KGB and spooks of all kinds.
   It is one of Washington's secrets, this whispery one-room shop.
Once you find it, there are plenty of clues that this is not your
run-of-the-mill bookstore.
   Access is controlled by a high-tech security door. Callers on
hold are treated to tape-recorded readings from famous spy tales.
The store is open to the public only three days a week and visitors
must check packages in lockers before entering.
   There is no telling who you'll bump into among the clientele.
   Elizabeth Bancroft, the store's founder and director, refuses to
name her customers. They prefer to remain covert. But patrons
include famous authors, literary editors, doctors, lawyers and, of
course, government officials from the United States and abroad.
   One customer of Ms. Bancroft's mail-order service was said to be
the late William J. Casey, former director of the CIA and author of
``The Secret War Against Hitler,'' posthumously published memoirs
of his service in the CIA's World War II forerunner, the Office of
Strategic Services. Norman Mailer and Jacqueline Onassis reportedly
have contacted the store.
   ``It's a crossroads for people in the intelligence community,''
says writer Jim Hougan. ``I consider myself knowledgeable in this
area, but some of the stuff in her store is really astonishing.''
   Joseph Goulden, another writer hooked on true spy tales, limits
himself to about one visit a month. ``If I went too often, I'd be
broke. I could easily spend $2,000 in there.''
   Browsers _ there are about 30 or 40 a day _ often spend several
hours at the center. Ms. Bancroft said she finally had to remove
chairs from the room to prevent patrons from parking themselves all
day.
   Ms. Bancroft, a crisp, black-haired woman who turned her
fascination with the netherworld of spying into her life's work,
prides herself on the range of books she has compiled.
   Most of the 1,400 titles are non-fiction, but the center stocks
a smattering of spy fiction, such as the works of John Le Carre and
Ian Fleming's James Bond stories.
   The store carries everything from the Soviet-inspired ``Devil
and His Dart: How the CIA Is Plotting in the Third World,'' to
``The Whole Spy Catalogue: an Espionage Lovers' Guide'' and David
Kahn's seminal volume on cryptography, ``The Code Breakers.''
Foreign language books are also displayed, mainly Russian and
French.
   On the lighter side, there are coffee mugs displaying KGB and
CIA emblems, government maps, ``James Bond's Bedside Companion,''
the ``Comic Book of MI5'' and a how-to book on passing the FBI's
entrance exam. The shop doesn't stock material on explosives or
silencers.
   The most popular books, Ms. Bancroft says, are from obscure
publishers: ``How To Disappear Completely And Never Be Found'' and
``How To Create A New Identity.'' The latter, written by
``Anonymous,'' outlines step-by-step ways to get a new driver's
license, credit cards, birth certificate and other documents.
   Among the duds: anything to do with the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``I had to give some Ollie North books away because no one was
buying them,'' Ms. Bancroft says. North, a former Marine lieutenant
colonel, has been indicted for his role in selling weapons to Iran
and diverting the profits to the Nicaraguan Contras.
   Bancroft, a Harvard-educated New Yorker who had worked as a
professional fund-raiser before she plunged into the book business,
started the center as a mail-order operation in her home about two
years ago. She specialized in finding obscure books on intelligence
gathering.
   So successful was the operation _ people routinely showed up at
her doorstep _ that she sold her house, moved into an apartment and
stocked a rented office with books. She expanded into new quarters
in the same building a few months ago.
   Until just recently, Ms. Bancroft didn't advertise. The shop
depended on whisper-of-mouth for customers to learn of its
existence.
   Although she has received strong moral support from well-known
ex-CIA officials, Ms. Bancroft says financing for the store comes
from private investors and loans.
   ``We have had people invest who are interested in the subject
matter, but no one I know of is being funded by an intelligence
group,'' she says.
   With only one assistant, Ms. Bancroft often works 18-hour days,
answering questions from customers, ordering books and wrapping
packages at the store, which started to turn a profit recently.
   Bancroft has no plans to expand to a regular, street-level
operation.
   ``People like the idea that we are hidden away,'' she says.
Besides, she adds, ``I am not big on dealing with the public.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Once traversed by caravans and coveted by
conquerors from Alexander the Great to the czars, Soviet Central
Asia is in the throes of social and demographic change. Its rapid
population growth, outstripping Soviet Europe's, is making this
traditionally Moslem area the new Soviet heartland.

   The hot evening air was laden with
yellow dust from the Kara Kum Desert when dark-eyed Murad Khydyrov
was born in a maple-shaded hospital and swaddled in a long white
cloth.
   Delivered by midwife Maria Trafimova, the infant, one of 120,000
born each year in the arid, oil-rich Soviet republic of Turkmenia,
tilted his nation's demographic balance a bit more away from the
Slavic North and toward the Moslem South.
   Sprawling over an area half the size of the continental United
States and peopled by more than 47 million inhabitants drawn from a
rich, multi-hued palette of ethnic groups, Soviet Central Asia is
now riding a demographic boom that is making it the country's new
heartland.
   Soviet Tadzhikistan alone has more than 30,000 bemedaled ``hero
mothers'' with 10 or more children each. In Turkmenia, children 14
and younger are 40 percent of the total population, and a majority
in some areas. Uzbekistan's overtaxed schools work double shifts.
   Exactly when Central Asians will outnumber their European
countrymen is in dispute. But an Asian majority that is largely
Moslem in customs and rural in lifestyle is forming. As it does, it
presents difficult problems for the Kremlin leadership, which for
seven decades has been dominated by Slavs and other urbanized
Europeans.
   Despite its demographic dynamism, Central Asia wields little
political clout on the national scene. None of its natives sits on
the Politburo, the Communist Party's ruling body, nor do Central
Asians wield heavy responsibility in the Moscow-based central
government.
   At the same time, the region _ from the blond-tinted deserts of
Turkmenia to ``the roof of the Soviet Union,'' the glacier-laced
peaks of the Pamirs in Tadzhikistan, _ is wrestling with the
demands of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's drive for economic and social
change.
   Statistics show ``perestroika,'' the Kremlin's campaign for
national economic renewal, is making slow headway in the five
republics of Soviet Central Asia _ Turkmenia, Tadzhikistan,
Kazakhstan, Kirgizia and Uzbekistan.
   ``Before the revolution, the beys and emirs ruled here,'' says
Khodzhimakhmud Umarov, an official of the State Economic Institute
of Tadzhikistan. ``After the revolution, the people kept on
receiving orders. Most are villagers and their psychology is
attuned to the command economy.''
   Gorbachev is pushing for tougher educational standards, but
Central Asia has always lagged behind the rest of the country in
schooling and continues to do so.
   The Kremlin wants to mobilize all labor resources, but there are
more idle hands in the new Soviet heartland than anywhere else, and
they show little inclination to move where the jobs are: the frigid
Russian North and Siberia.
   Central Asia faces burgeoning underemployment due to te rapid
population rise, and a cautious program launched last year to
promote ``family planning'' as a means of slowing population growth
has run into opposition from many traditionally minded women.
   In Turkemenia, implantation of intrauterine contraceptive
devices is free. ``The technology exists,'' says the health
minister, Kurban B. Chagilov. ``What we have to do is spread the
knowledge and overcome the repugnance.''
   ``Abortion and contraceptives are regarded here as
child-killing,'' says Dr. Yakub T. Tadzhiev, a prominent Tadzhik
public health specialist. ``It's almost unheard of for rural women
to use contraceptives.''
   Clashes between old and new are common in Central Asia. Marxism
co-exists here with Islam and Sufi mysticism. Rampant corruption
and criminal clans not only survive but flourish.
   Rockets bearing cosmonauts shoot skyward from the Baikonur
Cosmodrome on the desolate steppes of Kazakhstan, making Central
Asia the Soviet gate to space. But a lack of water mains in many
areas forces families to draw their drinking water from
microbe-infested irrigation ditches.
   Colossal state-of-the-art dams in mountainous Tadzhikistan
generate 15 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity to drive
sprawling industrial complexes. But in the lush emerald hills, a
bride can still be bought for up to $16,000.
   Decades of atheistic propaganda by the party, government and
state-sponsored Znaniye (Knowledge) Society, as well as the
subjugation of the Islamic clergy to the state, have failed to
shake the faith of millions of Central Asians.

   Even government officials and members of the Communist Party
``pander to obsolete views'' and take part in Moslem rituals,
Gorbachev noted while on a 1986 tour of Uzbekistan. He ordered such
people held ``strictly to account.''
   ``Almost one third of the people in our republic remain under
the control of Islam,'' Murod N. Khudoyev, deputy propaganda chief
for Tadzhikistan's Communist Party, remarked with obvious
disapproval. ``Half of those with a middle-school education see no
difference between the words `Tadzhik' and `Moslem.'''
   Still, Gorbachev's rise to power has tightened the Kremlin's
hold on the area. In the three years since he became general
secretary, party bosses in all five republics have been replaced
and many of their underlings sent into political obilivion.
   One high-level ouster showed how the region's ethnic differences
and latent hostility toward the politically dominant Russians can
flare into violence. In December 1986, Dinmukhamed Kunaev, a
Kazakh, was fired as party boss in corruption-riddled Kazakhstan,
and replaced by a Russian, Gennady Kolbin.
   Thousands of young Kazakhs rioted in the republic's capital,
Alma Ata, and went on a two-day rampage of looting and arson in
which two people were killed, 200 injured and dozens arrested.
   More commonly, though, the Central Asians co-exist with the
large European populations that began flowing southward with the
establishment of czarist power in the 19th century.
   But this is not a melting pot.
   In Dushanbe, Tadzhikistan's sycamore-dotted capital city of
600,000, only about 5 percent of the marriages join Tadzhiks and
Russians. In the countryside, where two-thirds of the republic's
4.8 million people live, laborers in the fields do not understand
simple questions in Russian.
   Nevertheless, Russian is the language of power and prestige and
of local elites.
   In Tashkent, the region's most populous city with 2.1 million
inhabitants, there is only one Russian child among the 829 pupils
of Middle School No. 9, where instruction is in Uzbek.
   But Russian language courses are mandatory.
   ``It's the language of culture and of contact,'' explains the
principal, Natalya A. Mamutova.
   In education, sanitation and health care, the new Soviet seems
more Third World than superpower. In Turkmenia, 55 of every 1,000
babies die before their first birthday, giving the swath of desert
north of Afghanistan and Iran the Soviet Union's highest infant
death rate, a figure more than twice the national average of 25 per
1,000.
   Local officials proudly note that although not a single
university existed in Central Asia before the 1917 Bolshevik
Revolution, Kazakhstan alone now has 275,000 students in its
institutions of higher learning.
   But an army general has complained publicly that Uzbek school
graduates learn so little in school that they have to be taught in
the army to scrub their teeth and that they don't understand the
simplest orders in Russian.
   In some areas of Central Asia, the infant mortality rate is as
high as 70 per 1,000 live births _ seven times the U.S. figure _
the labor daily Trud reported recently.
   Ashkhabad's Maternity Hospital, where seven-pound, one-ounce
Murad Khydyrov was born, is a microcosm of sanitation problems. Its
green walls were streaked with dirt, and a pair of forceps lay on
the floor in the room where Murad was swaddled.
   A special SWAT team of doctors from the European Soviet Union
was dispatched recently to the fabled ancient cities of Samarkand
and Bukhara in Uzbekistan to combat an outbreak of hepatitis.
   With the area's population rise, those problems seem fated to
increase, as well as the knotty task of finding work for Central
Asia's new sons and daughters.
   Tadzhikstan now has 234,000 residents classified as ``not taking
part in social production,'' and Umarov, the economist, says
300,000 new jobs must be created in the next seven years to keep
pace with the birthrate.
   Nevertheless, local elites stress the progress made in the
region under Soviet rule, voice their faith in perestroika and
compare their lands not with Europe, but with neighboring Asian
countries.
   ``If you want to see what Soviet power has done for our people,
go to the peaks of our Pamir mountains, and look down at
Tadzhikistan, then at Afghanistan across the border and compare,''
says Dushabne Mayor Makhsud M. Ikramov.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ With the number of aging Americans growing year
by year, day care centers for the elderly are springing up across
the country as alternatives to nursing homes. One reason is that
day care is less expensive. Adult day care costs an average of
about $28 a day, less than half the cost of full-time care in a
nursing home.

   Michael Chickillo has lost weight and
developed high blood pressure as his wife's Alzheimer's disease has
progressed to the point where she often forgets what she had for
lunch by mid-afternoon.
   ``I told the doctor I'd give my right arm to make it stop,''
Chickillo said recently, choking back tears.
   To give himself time for chores around his home in this
northeastern Pennsylvania city, Chickillo has joined a growing
number of Americans choosing day care for an elderly family member.
   Health care officials say day care is less expensive than a
nursing home and keeps the elderly at home longer. They said it
also provides a respite for people like Chickillo, who must keep a
constant watch on his wife, Lena, when she is home.
   There are 1,700 adult day care centers nationally serving more
than 50,000 people, nearly three times the number of centers open
in 1980 and up from 1,200 in 1985, authorities say.
   Adult day care centers now operate in all 50 states and the
District of Columbia, says Dorothy Howe, program coordinator for
the National Institute on Adult Daycare.
   ``It's across the country, but it's still quite small,'' Ms.
Howe says.
   Cherry Hospital in Goldsboro, N.C., was a pioneer in adult day
care in the United States in 1969 when it recruited an English
doctor to tart a gerontology program.
   Dr. Lionel Z. Cosin, who taught at Oxford University's medical
school, began a day care center for patients in the hospital, which
is 50 miles east of Raleigh, says Lulu Jolliff, an administrator
who worked with Cosin. Cosin had opened a number of the centers in
England before coming to the United States.
   About 2.2 million people care for a spouse or relative who has a
problem with at least one activity of daily living, such as
bathing, dressing or eating, says Lynn Osterkamp, editor of Parent
Care, a national newsletter.
   About 5.8 million of the 29.2 million Americans 65 or older are
in nursing homes, she says.
   Elderly care officials point to the graying of America as one
reason why adult day care will continue to grow.
   By 2030, 65 million Americans will be 65 or older, according to
an estimate by the American Association of Retired Persons.
   Three days a week, Chickillo drives his 75-year-old wife to
Community Day Services in Scranton, where she joins about 30 other
elderly people unable to care for themselves.
   There, they watch television, sing songs, play games and get
physical, speech and occupational therapy under the supervision of
a staff that includes two full-time nurses.
   ``We try to make it as much like a senior center as possible,''
says Janet Ann Melnick, in charge of the four-year-old center.
   On a recent afternoon, Kathy Herne, a volunteer, strummed tunes
such as ``Harvest Moon'' and ``Singing in the Rain'' on a guitar
while half a dozen elderly men and women sat in front of her
clapping, singing along or just listening. At one point, two women
danced together on the tile floor.
   Helga Hartman, who suffers from diabetes and walks with
difficulty, sat at a table toward the back of the room and worked
on a puzzle. Others sat silently at different tables.
   Ms. Howe and day care administrators said the number of centers
would increase even though they have been hurt financially because
adult day care is not covered by Medicare.
   ``There are a number that have to get out of the business simply
because of funding,'' Ms. Howe says.
   Separate bills pending before the U.S. House and Senate would
provide Medicare funding for adult day care.
   Financially needy people are eligible for Medicaid funding for
adult day care in 25 states, but not in Pennsylvania, Howe says.

   The state has budgeted $5.2 million through county agencies for
financial assistance for day care costs at the state's 118 centers,
says John Holloway, who is in charge of adult day care for the
state Department of Aging.
   Adult day care costs an average of about $28 a day, less than
half the cost of a nursing home, authorities say.
   ``It gives people options where, before we had the centers, they
didn't have those options,'' says Mary Ann Outwater, executive
director of Windsor House Adult Day Care in Cambridge, Mass.
   Corporations are beginning to pay attention to the growing need
for adult day care.
   Hallmark Cards Inc., based in Kansas City, Mo., in 1986 began
offering employees a free referral service for day care or other
health needs for their children, elderly parents or disabled family
members.
   Meg Townsend, a company spokesman, says two-career families will
increase the need for adult day care for elderly family members.
   ``There's just not as much time to address family concerns, but
they're as important as ever,'' she says.
   Stride Rite Corp. of Cambridge, Mass., is considering expanding
its subsidized child day centers at two Boston area plants to
include the elderly.
   A survey at the company showed 25 percent of employees care for
an elderly relative and 13 percent more expect to in the next five
years, says Amy Derbedrosian, a spokeswoman for the company.
   Nursing homes have adapted by starting adult day care centers of
their own.
   A 1985 survey of 847 adult day care centers nationwide showed 22
percent were in nursing homes, Ms. Howe says. Churches ran 18
percent of the centers; senior centers, 12 percent; community
centers, 7 percent, and hospitals, 5 percent, the survey showed.
   Ms. Howe says 40 states and the District of Columbia have
developed standards for funding, licensing or certification.
   Elderly people suffering from Alzheimer's disease or other forms
of cognitive impairment make up the majority of adult day care
clients, authorities say.
   A 1987 survey by the Pennsylvania Adult Day Care Association
found two-thirds of the elderly attending day care centers in the
state fit into this catagory, says Barbara K. Visconti, president
of the organization.
   In Pittsburgh, Council Care Adult Day Care has designed one of
its three centers specifically for people with Alzheimer's, an
irreversible neurological disorder that affects 2.5 million
Americans.
   Ruth Kaplan, executive director for the centers, says staff
members at Council Care II play games with the elderly to help them
remember the events of the day and talk about memories of their
youths.
   ``They are being stimulated. If they sat at home and were not
stimulated, it is our feeling they would lose their skills more
rapidly,'' Ms. Kaplan says.
   In Scranton, Chickillo washes the dishes, does the laundry and
cleans the two-story, century-old house in an ethnic, working class
neighborhood when his wife goes to the day care center.
   ``She likes it there, and I tell her she's going to the club,''
says Chickillo, 71.
   Even with the day care center, Chickillo, a retired quality
control engineer, has had to give up playing in the local bowling
league, where he had a 200 average.
   ``It's a burden. My friends, they think I'm dead,'' Chickillo
says.
   In the three years his wife's memory has faded and her
disorientation has increased, Chickillo says he has lost more than
20 pounds and started taking medication for high blood pressure.
   Chickillo says the day care center has lessened the stress of
caring for his wife of 38 years.
   ``This is heaven sent for me because I'm a 24-hour nurse at
home,'' he says.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Trudy Wodinsky has a good voice, she's
attractive and she wants to become a professional opera singer.
Once a divorced mother drawing welfare, today she works as a
secretary while pursuing the career that so far has eluded her. A
New Yorker through-and-through, she has discovered, ``There are too
many Trudys out there.''

<TEXT>
   When aspiring opera singer Trudy Wodinsky found
herself divorced and living on welfare, with an autistic son to
support, her interest in music was put on hold.
   It was an untoward happenstance for Trudy, an attractive
5-foot-1 brunette with dark eyes and long hair and the kind of
figure that only recently got her into trouble when she wore
stretch pants and high heels to the office.
   Here she was, unable to support herself, a talented girl from a
comfortable middle-class family on Long Island that was able to
enroll her in violin lessons at age 9. Her father worked as an
accountant five days a week and did gigs as a jazz saxophonist on
weekends, playing weddings and bar mitzvahs. Her mother was a high
school math teacher and later taught at Queensborough Community
College.
   Trudy won a scholarship to Manhattan School of Music, majoring
in violin. Her passion for opera would come later. She was working
in the college cafeteria when she met her husband-to-be, a student
from Peru, a symphony conductor who eventually worked with singer
Al Martino and others.
   Married at age 18, Trudy had a son at 19. But the marriage fell
apart after about eight years.
   ``I was on welfare for several years because my son's father
wasn't supporting us,'' says Trudy, who now works as a secretary
while actively pursuing an operatic career. She works mainly with
some of New York's prestigious small opera companies, putting in
long nights after long days at the office.
   ``At that time I couldn't do anything. I went from my parents'
home to school to marriage. I was totally unprepared.''
   The road out of her welfare morass began with a part-time job in
a photography studio in the apartment building on Manhattan's West
Side, where she still lives. Next she worked in a health food
store, then for a wholesale gourmet food concern during the
Christmas rush. Her first full-time secretarial job was for an
insurance agency.
   ``That got to be uncomfortable in certain ways, because it was
only a two-person office and the other person was a man,'' she
recalls.
   Next came work at Gimbel's, first in the customer service
department and then in the credit office. About three years ago,
Trudy got her present job as a secretary at Corporate Property
Investors, a Manhattan firm that, among other things, owns and
manages shopping malls around the country.
   As her son grew older and more active, Trudy was no longer able
to control him. He now lives with his father in Queens.
   While she still plays the violin professionally on occasion, she
now spends her extra money for weekly sessions with voice teachers
and coaches, two different things, serious singers will tell you.
In the past few years she has had roles as a soprano with such
amateur groups as the Amato Opera, Bel Canto Opera, New York Opera
Theater and Manhattan Opera.
   The most she has ever been paid for singing with these companies
is a $100 honorarium. She does get paid, however, as a soloist with
a choir that performs in the Catskills during the Jewish holidays.
   ``That's something that's very unfortunate in this country, that
young singers often don't get paid and they do what I do, which is
to support themselves in other ways,'' she says.
   Her days are long these days, 9 to 5 in the office, most nights
in rehearsal, no time for social life. A recent romance fizzled.
Blame her busy schedule.
   ``Right now I'm involved with the Bel Canto Opera, which is a
small opera company,'' she says. ``I'm doing the part of a satyr,
which is half human male, half goat. It's my second male part in a
year. I don't know what they're trying to tell me. They told me
it's definitely not type-casting.''
   Bill Zakariasen, music critic of the New York Daily News, said
in a review of the Amato Opera Company's performance of ``Salvator
Rosa'' that ``Soprano Trudy Wodinsky was very appealing in the
trouser role of Rosa's youthful assistant Gennariello.''
   But nobody would mistake Trudy Wodinsky for a guy in her street
clothes.
   Recently an executive in her company relayed word that she
should dress more appropriately in her office, forgo the stretch
pants that she was wont to wear.
   ``They were form-fitting,'' she says, laughing. ``This day I was
dressed for the theater. I thought I looked rather nice. I had on a
nice black top and black high-heel shoes. A day or two later I was
told I have to learn to project a corporate image.''
   Trudy says Re Koster, an elderly but well-known voice teacher in
The Netherlands, has invited her to visit Amsterdam for some
lessons.
   ``She came to New York and worked with several people,'' she
says. ``She like me a lot and invited me to go. So I'm going to go
and work very intensely for two weeks.''
   In November she will make her New York city recital debut at the
Merkin Concert Hall under the auspices of the Hans and Rosy L.
Epstein Committee for the Enhancement of Creativity Among Children.
   What kind of voice does Trudy Wodinsky have?
   ``If I had to categorize myself I'd call myself a lyric
coloratura soprano,'' says Trudy, who counts Dame Joan Sutherland
and Beverly Sills among the singers she most admires. ``Coloratura
is the very highest of the voices and a lyric is lower and fuller.
I'm kind of in between.''
   Trudy is realistic about her chances of finding a career in
opera.
   ``There are too many Trudys out there, too many sopranos out
there, too many people I'm competing with,'' she says. ``How many
people I don't know. Hundreds of thousands.
   ``I was pretty naive. In the beginning I thought, well, I'm
talented, I have a pretty voice, I'm cute, so everything will work
out for me. I had no idea how difficult it is.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Dian Fossey fought hard to protect the remnants
of Africa's mountain gorillas and apparently paid for it with her
life. Now those who carry on her work hope a forthcoming movie on
Fossey's singular adventure will spur public interest and donations.
   
^By JOE WHEELAN</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The head of a fund that carries on
primate researcher Dian Fossey's work after her murder in Africa
expects a movie about Fossey's life to pique public interest in the
plight of the endangered mountain gorilla.
   Claude Ramsey, head of the Digit Fund _ which continues Fossey's
work today through the Englewood-based Morris Animal Foundation _
hopes the film this fall will keep pressure on gorilla poachers and
heighten awareness of one of the closest primate relatives of man.
   Fewer than 400 of the huge, gentle apes remain in the world
today, none of them in captivity. Most live in Rwanda's Parc
National des Volcans in central Africa's Virunga Mountains, where
Fossey conducted her studies.
   ``The gorillas come across as very friendly in the movie. It's
going to make the world a lot more conscious of the gorillas and
the problem of poaching,'' Ramsey said. ``Since Dian Fossey's
death, poaching has diminished. There's a lull.''
   ``Gorillas in the Mist,'' also the title of the book Fossey
wrote about her research, will feature actress Sigourney Weaver as
the American researcher. Fossey went to Rwanda in early 1967 at the
urging of anthropologist Dr. Louis Leakey and stayed on until her
murder, when she was 53, at Karisoke Research Center on Mount Viske.
   The Morris Animal Foundation hopes the movie will spur public
donations to the Digit Fund. Ramsey said that Karisoke Research
Center needs $65,000 in maintenance funds and $100,000 worth of
capital improvements.
   Fossey founded the Digit Fund in 1978, naming it after a male
gorilla she had befriended and studied closely for 10 years before
it was killed by poachers on 12,000-foot Mount Visoke. His head and
hands were cut off to be sold as souvenirs.
   ``I am anxious to establish a `Digit Fund' to attempt to raise
money to maintain students, to train Rwandans in the patrol of the
park, and for additional census work on the Rwandan side of the
Virungas...so that stronger efforts may be made to protect them and
to actively secure their survival,'' Fossey wrote in 1978. ``Here,
at camp, we wake up each morning wondering who will be next.''
   Ramsey, who has headed the Morris Animal Foundation for 20 of
its 40 years, says Fossey talked to him in 1985 about the the
possibility of the foundation and the Digit Fund working together.
   About a year after Fossey's murder, Stacey Coil, a friend of
Fossey's who had become president of the Digit Fund, suggested that
the Morris Animal Foundation administer the fund.
   Ramsey's foundation now oversees the fund, and the two entities
will officially merge next year. The Digit Fund has about 2,000
donors, he says.
   ``The purpose of the whole fund is to continue Fossey's work at
Karisoke Research Center,'' Ramsey says.
   Three researchers and the center director carry on both Fossey's
studies of the mountain gorilla at Karisoke and her conservation
efforts.
   The Digit Fund also opened a veterinary laboratory at Mount
Visoke in January to provide the gorillas with medical care and to
investigate their health problems. David Kenny of the Denver Zoo
ran the lab for two months and was succeeded by Barkley Hastings of
the London Zoo. Ramsey says veterinarians will be rotated every few
months.
   ``It's a plum job,'' says Ramsey, providing veterinarians with a
unique opportunity to observe and care for gorillas in their native
habitat.
   The Digit Fund also plans to build a Dian Fossey museum at the
foot of the Virunga Mountains some day.
   The movie to be released this fall will deal with Fossey's
skirmishes with poachers _ legendary in Rwanda, where she was known
as ``The Lone Woman of the Forest.''
   Fossey began regular patrols of Mount Visoke's slopes to protect
the gorillas and was known to fire shots to frighten intruders. In
at least one case, Fossey, who had emphysema, helped chase and
capture a poacher thought to be involved in Digit's death.
   Poachers initially were suspected of killing Fossey, but Rwanda
government officials and others have ruled out that theory because
of the way she was killed.
   Fossey was found dead on Dec. 28, 1985, on the floor of her
Karisoke cabin, her skull split by a large knife that she owned.
Beside her on the floor were a pistol and a clip of ammunition.
   The Rwandan government charged Wayne McGuire, a student
researcher at Karisoke, with Fossey's murder, but no credible
motive ever was established. McGuire fled to the United States,
which has no extradition agreement with Rwanda. A native tracker
fired months earlier by Fossey also was charged. He died in a
Rwandan jail.
   Some observers think Fossey's vigorous conservation efforts may
have led parties who wanted economic development of Rwanda's
volcanic region to plot her death.
   Fossey advocated minimal human contact with the gorillas, which
put her at odds with those who wanted to use the gorillas to lure
tourists to the Virunga Mountains. Fossey was concerned that the
gorillas would contract human diseases, against which they have no
immunity. She linked some gorilla deaths on Mount Visoke to human
contact.
   ``I suspect he (the killer) was hired, or suborned, by
influential people who increasingly viewed Dian as a dangerous
impediment to the exploitation of the Parc National des Volcans,
and especially to the exploitation of the gorillas,'' Farley Mowat
wrote in his biography of Fossey, ``Woman in the Mists.''
   Ramsey says Fossey's message has been taken to heart by natives
of Mount Visoke. During dedication ceremonies for the veterinary
laboratory this year, the natives sang and performed skits
promoting the preservation of the mountain gorilla.
   ``I had always suspected that they were not too concerned about
the poaching,'' Ramsey says. ``But now I saw these villagers had
made up their own songs and skits and that poaching truly had
become unpopular there. Two years ago, I'm not really sure it was.''

   It was a broken romance that first brought
New York stage actress Alley Mills to Los Angeles for a career in
television.
   Mills, who stars as the mother on ABC's ``The Wonder Years,''
had grown up in a household devoted to the creative arts. She
attended private school, Bennington College and Yale University,
where she graduated magna cum laude in 1973. She got her master's
degree at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts.
   She was on ``The Patti Page Show'' at 8, and while still at
Bennington had a role in the feature film ``Diary of a Mad
Housewifrst boyfriend, at age 15, was Christopher Reeve, who grew
up to become ``Superme.''
   Her fian.'' But it was a rift with another boyfriend
at the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts, where she
made her professional stage debut, that caused her to flee to Los
Angeles.
   ``I'd never been to California and I heard they were doing
`Voices,' a play by a playwright I loved,'' she says. ``I was
traveling in a Volkswagen Beetle and I walked in to audition in
blue jeans and barefoot. They said I needed an agent. I wrote a
note saying I was outraged that trtant on stage. Otherwise, the techniques
are
the same. You just have to be a little bigger and a little louder
on stage.''
   Audiences expecting to see another off-the-wall Belker on stage
in ``Frankie and Johnny'' are in for a jolt. Johnny is a bit of a
romantic, a man who quotes _ and misquotes _ Shakespeare and who's
not afraid to make a permanent commitment, unlike the skittish
Belker.
   ``Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune'' is a verbal tennis
match.
   ``Mentally, it's difficult,'' Weitz says. ``There is no place to
rest. Carol and I get to the theater a little early each day and
talk about the changes. We're still working on it. There's a lot of
material there to sort out.
   ``I think that I drive the play, and she has all the good laugh
lines _ which is fair.''
   His journey back to New York and off-Broadway from Los Angeles
and television was not part of any grand design. Weitz, born and
raised in Norwalk, Conn., says none of his career was planned.
   ``I just knew that when I graduated from college, I wanted to
work in a regional theater for a little while,'' he says. ``That
was all. The rest just happened.''
   ``A little while'' turned into nearly nine years, but they were
years where he honed his craft doing Shakespeare, Shaw and many
other playwrights in between. His first job after graduating from
Carnegie Tech, now Carnegie Mellon, in Pittsburgh was at the Long
Wharf Theater in Connecticut. He spent a year there, then several
more at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis and finally four years
at Arena Stage in Washington.
   ``Those jobs came from people seeing me work,'' Weitz says.
   He eventually moved to New York and landed roles in several
Broadway plays including ``Norman, Is That You?'' and ``The Basic
Training of Pavlo Hummel.''
   The quest for better-paying jobs took Weitz to Los Angeles and
eventually to ``Hill Street Blues.''
   ``My preference was the stage but I wasn't making enough money,
even though I was working constantly in New York,'' he says.
   The character of Belker stood out in the large, repertory-size
cast on ``Hill Street Blues.'' Whether that was good or bad, Weitz
isn't sure.
   ``If people remember me at all, they'll remember me from `Hill
Street Blues,''' he says. ``I have no control over that. So I don't
even think about it.''
   For now, he is content with ``Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de
Lune,'' finding variety in this lower-class cook.
   ``The role is changing constantly,'' he says. ``I'm always
discovering nuances to make it better.''
   Would he go back to television?
   ``Sure. I would be more than happy to do another character
similar to Belker if it were as well written as Belker was
written,'' Weitz says. ``But I'm still looking.''

   ``D.O.A.'' (Touchstone, VHS-Beta, $89.95; Rated R)
   
   What began life as a first-rate, low-budget thriller starring
Edmond O'Brien in 1949 was remade recently into a perfectly
dreadful mish-mash starring Dennis Quaid.
   The original had a novel premise _ the hero is fed a slow-acting
fatal poison at the outset and spends the rest of the movie
tracking down his murderer. It also had, thanks to Rudolph Mate's
direction and Ernest Laszlo's photography, a classically mournful
``film noir'' quality. O'Brien was at his best as the slightly
seedy small-town businessman who goes to San Francisco for a good
time and meets his doom.
   The folks at Touchstone Studios who snapped up the property
decided for some reason to transport the story to a college campus
where Quaid is cast _ unconvincingly _ as a literature professor
who wrote some brilliant novels and then developed a severe case of
writer's block.
   His entanglements with his ex-wife, a nubile student, a
publish-or-perish colleague and a wealthy alumna are all equally
improbable and ultimately boring. Despite inappropriate stabs at
humor and philosophical seriousness, the movie is mostly an excuse
for a lot of violence. Nearly every major character ends up dead
before it's mercifully over.
   They should have let ``D.O.A.'' R.I.P.

   ``Nuts'' (Warner Home Video, VHS-Beta and available with Spanish
subtitles, $89.95; Rated R)
   
   ``Nuts'' asks and answers the question of just who is crazy.
   Claudia Faith Draper, a smart and oh-so-high-priced hooker
played by Barbra Streisand, is fighting desperately for the right
to go on trial _ and avoid a mental institution _ for killing a
customer. Her harrowing competency hearing is the focus of Martin
Ritt's 1987 film.
   Streisand, who also is the producer, is by turns funny,
frightening and touching. Her character is rarely off-screen,
forcefully arguing her sanity based on her rules, not the court's,
not society's.
   ``I know what you expect me to do,'' she says at one point.
``But I'm not just a picture in your head.''
   She is joined by a wonderful cast in the courtroom drama that
shows off the talents of Maureen Stapleton and Karl Malden as
Claudia's mother and stepfather, Eli Wallach as a psychiatrist,
James Whitmore as the judge, Robert Webber as the prosecutor and
Richard Dreyfuss as her reluctant, court-appointed lawyer.
   The performances are striking. And as Claudia's future is
determined, the tension among the characters is painful and
gripping.
   But it turns, unfortunately, to edginess. It is too drawn out,
as Claudia, with immeasurable help from Dreyfuss' Aaron Levinsky,
resolves a life's worth of troubles before the worldly judge.
   Still, ``Nuts'' has something to say, and it's worth hearing.

<HEAD>Star Watch: A Patrician Among Comics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Summer moviegoers may be surprised to find
the patrician beauty Dina Merrill among such comics as Jackie
Mason, Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase in ``Caddyshack II.''
   Miss Merrill herself is cool about it: ``After all I worked with
Jerry Lewis''; not to mention ``I'll Take Sweden'' with Bob Hope.
   When she was approached by Warner Bros., she admits, ``My
initial reaction was that they'd found the wrong person. My agent
assured me that there was indeed a part that was just right for me.
So I went, and ended up with the job.
   ``I play Bob Stack's wife, and he is the president of the
country club. Jackie Mason's daughter and our daughter are best
friends, and Jackie's daughter wants her father to join the country
club. He's a far-out character who wants to develop all the land
around the country club. Needless to say, terrible things happen
when he tries to join.''
   Mason is the veteran comic whose career zoomed with his one-man
Broadway show. He was a last-minute replacement for Rodney
Dangerfield, who starred in the original ``Caddyshack.'' Miss
Merrill found Mason a puzzlement.
   ``I never could figure out when Jackie was putting me on and
when he wasn't,'' she said. ``He's very straight; he looks at you
and talks with this serious face. He doesn't even twitch.
   ``First you think he's putting you on. Then he looks so serious
you decide no, he isn't. That's when he's gotcha. All of a sudden
you see the twitch, and you say, `I've been had.'
   ``He's a lot of fun, but he was kind of bored with the film. He
kept saying, `You really like this?' I said, `Yeah,' and he said,
`Boring!' He couldn't understand why he had to do it over and over,
and he missed that feedback from an audience.''
   Nothing seems to perturb Dina Merrill. She maintains her cool
serenity in all situations, and laughter comes easily to her. Her
career has been amazingly varied, considering the fact that she has
never had to support herself.
   She was born with a platinum spoon, the daughter of Edward F.
Hutton and Marjorie Merriweather Post of the cereal fortune. Though
she obviously wanted for nothing, she was determined to make her
own name in life. Born Nedinia Hutton (her parents expected a boy
to be called Ned), she chose the acting name of Dina Merrill.
   ``I guess the work ethic comes from my parents,'' she observed.
``My father was a very hard-working guy, and my mother in her own
way was, too. It was always just drilled into me.''
   Her parents were unprepared for their only child to be an
actress. ``There would be total disbelief when I came home and
said, `I got the best job!' This kept going on, then I got married
and retired and they said, `Whew! That's over now. She can do what
she should do: be a wife and mother.' And I did, but then I figured
out I could do both.''
   Dina was married first to socialite Stanley Rumbough with whom
she had a son, Stanley Jr., and a daughter, Nina, and then to actor
Cliff Robertson, with whom she had a daughter, Heather. They have
been separated, and a divorce is expected in the fall.
   Her career has encompassed films (``Operation Petticoat,''
``Butterfield 8''), theater (``Angel Street,'' ``Any Wednesday'')
and television (``Roots II,'' ``Hot Pursuit''). Two years ago she
made her debut in musical comedy, playing Broadway and touring with
``On Your Toes.'' She is now a partner in a film company, Greenroom
Enterprises, and has appeared in its first film, ``Twisted,'' with
more in the works.
   From her New York base, she devotes her energies to such causes
as the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation and the Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts. She also is the only woman on the board of
directors of the Shearson Lehman Hutton brokerage firm.
   Reflecting on her heritage, she said: ``I was very fortunate
that I did have everything I wanted handed to me on a silver
platter, so to speak. But I also had good training from both
parents about the work ethic, about the fact that I was lucky, as
they were. And that a lot of that had to be put back into the
world, to help other people get a start and to be fortunate, too,
in their way.''

reunited in Basel.
   Drawings of them are on display in the first joint showing of
the world's two most important collections of the graphic work of
Hans Holbein the Younger, the Basel burgher who became the court
painter of Henry VIII.
   The exhibit comprises 50 drawings from the collection of Queen
Elizabeth II on loan to the Basel Kunstmuseum and the 80 works
normally on display at the museum.
   ``An ancient wish has come true,'' Kunstmuseum director
Christian Gelhaar said at the opening. The exhibition of the 130
works spans a career that made the German-born Holbein the first
portrait painter to achieve international fame.
   It ranges from a study for a double-portrait of a Basel mayor
and his wife, when he was 19, to a drawing of an English nobleman,
done shortly before the artist fell victim, at the age of 46, to a
plague sweeping London in 1543.
   Holbein, a friend of the Dutch scholar and humanist Erasmus,
came to England in 1526 in search of lucrative orders because the
arts were ``freezing'' in Basel, as Erasmus put it.
   Erasmus sent him to Sir Thomas More, the later Chancellor, who
became Holbein's first patron. More's warning that Holbein ``may
not find England such fruitful and fertile land as he had hoped,''
as he wrote Erasmus, was soon disproved.
   Portraits of Henry Guildford, newly-named treasurer of the crown
by Henry VIII, and his wife, were among the key works Holbein did
during a first two-year stay in England. Another was a More family
portrait which has vanished.
   Returning to Basel, Holbein took with him the studies for More's
family portrait, a gift for Erasmus, and for the portrait of Lady
Mary. The painting he did of her is now in Missouri at the St.
Louis Art Museum.
   By that time, Holbein was wealthy enough to buy two houses in
Basel and received well paid commissions. But iconoclastic riots by
fanatic Protestants boded ill for the future of an ambitious artist.
   One of the victims was his altarpiece of the Last Supper, which
was chopped to pieces. Most of the fragments were salvaged,
however, later joined together in an irregular way and even painted
over. At the exhibition the piece returns to public view after more
than two decades of painstaking restoration.
   In 1532, Holbein made England his permanent home, leaving behind
his family and most of his oeuvre to become known, according to an
ancient English biographical note, as ``the greatest Master Truly
(in the arts) after the Liffe that ever was.''
   The 50 drawings on loan through Sept. 4 from Windsor Castle,
make evident that this last period marked the culmination of his
career as a portrait painter.
   They impress visitors by the unerring way in which Holbein
captured the features of his subjects, his sure sense of pattern
and the proficiency with which the left-handed artist worked with
generous strokes of black and colored chalks.
   A few show that even Holbein had his off-days, as Jane Roberts,
curator of the Print Room at Windsor Castle, commented at the
opening.
   Drawing an annual salary of 120 pounds sterling from the court,
he portrayed merchants, scholars, statesmen and, mostly, members of
the court and nobility.
   Many of them were protagonists in a stormy period of English
history that, somewhat surprisingly, seemed to leave Holbein
unperturbed. The Windsor collection includes drawings of Anne
Boleyn, the second wife of Henry VIII who was beheaded in 1536, of
Jane Seymour, the third wife, as well of Baron Rich, whose
testimony led to the execution of Thomas More.
   No preparatory drawing of Henry VIII survived. And what is rated
as Holbein's most masterful portrait of the monarch is in London _
on loan. It is part of the Lugano Collection of Baron Heinrich von
Thyssen-Bornemisza which Britain, like other countries, is bidding
to be the permanent host.

   Fans of the Go-Go's will recognize the catchy
pop music on Jane Wiedlin's new album, ``Fur.'' They may be
surprised, however, to hear what she has to say.
   ``This is not any easy life, it's hard to hang on to hope,''
Wiedlin sings on ``Inside a Dream,'' the first single. ``There's so
many things need to change. Well, I wonder how we cope.''
   ``The world's a really crummy place, but we can't give up
because we know that,'' Wiedlin said. ``We have to keep fighting to
improve things.''
   Wiedlin was the rhythm guitarist for the Go-Go's, an all-female
band whose debut album, ``Beauty and the Beat,'' went No. 1 in
1982. Their videos presented an image of five cheerful, carefree
young women.
   ``The Go-Go's were always perceived as being upbeat but there
was a lot of suffering as well,'' Wiedlin said.
   ``Fur'' is Wiedlin's second solo record. Anyone familiar with
Go-Go's songs such as ``Our Lips Are Sealed'' and ``Head Over
Heels'' may not be prepared for the more serious mood of ``Inside a
Dream,'' but Wiedlin is not concerned.
   ``I've learned a lesson because of the Go-Go's, and that's not
to worry about how people see me,'' she said in an interview.
   Wiedlin has become more politically active since leaving the
Go-Go's in 1984. On her first solo LP, she included postcards to be
sent to President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev,
urging them to dismantle nuclear arms. She became a vegetarian five
years ago and has campaigned actively for animal rights.
   ``The Go-Gos's were a combination. It's just me and my
personality now and my ideas,'' Wiedlin said. ``I've been more
outspoken on world events and animal rights and so forth.''
   The title song on ``Fur'' is a direct plea not to wear aninal
furs.
   ``I wore a fur coat in the band and it really never occurred to
me, the violence behind it,'' Wiedlin recalled. ``When I see people
wearing fur, they overlook the violence. I want people to connect
fur coats with animals.
   ``I just feel that people should take more responsibility for
their actions.''
   ``Fur'' was Wiedlin's favorite song on the album.
   ``I'm most proud of `Fur' because it's real difficult to write a
song about social issues without sounding preachy or
holier-than-thou,'' she said. ``I've been trying to do that for
years.''
   Wiedlin co-wrote all the songs on ``Fur.'' At the suggestion of
her record label, EMI-Manhattan, she used several different
partners, including Regina Cole, who wrote ``Baby Love'' for
Regina, and Peter Rafelson and Garder Cole, who have worked with
Madonna.
   ``I went with this idea,'' Wiedlin said. ``I don't like writing
by myself anymore. Working with someone, you can talk about
things.''
   Wiedlin has tried to simplify her songwriting style over the
years.
   ``I've become more interested in the way words sound, rather
than their meaning. The idea behind the words is what's most
important.''
   The album was produced by Stephen Hague, who had worked on the
hits ``West End Girls'' and ``What Have I Done to Deserve This?''
for the Pet Shop Boys. Wiedlin said Hague was her ``one and only
choice'' for ``Fur.''
   ``I'd heard a demo that had four or five different bands on it
and every band sounded great,'' she said. ``I had never heard a
producer whose work sounded so consistently good.
   ``He brought this feeling of coherence to the album. He gave it
such a strong sound; it was almost like a concept album.''
   While the recording of ``Fur'' went smoothly, taking only 28
days, Wiedlin disagreed with her record label over the order of
songs. The company wanted to put all the potential singles on one
side and end the record with ``The End of Love,'' which she
considered too depressing. She wanted to end with the more
optomistic ``Whatever It Takes,'' which the label wanted to release
as a single.
   Wiedlin won out but admitted, ``We duked it out on that one.''
   Although her first solo record sold poorly, she's confident
she'll attract a following.
   ``I think that it's slowly building. I'm not very worried about
that,'' Wiedlin said. ``The basis of my following are people that
loved the Go-Go's. That's a hardcore group of people.''
   Wiedlin wants to tour before the end of the year and hopes her
music will get people more involved in social causes.
   ``It has the ability to change things. I get letters from fans
that say they're really proud of me,'' she said. ``I'm trying to
help the animals. Getting even just one fan to help is enough.
   ``I like to encourage people to be active in social change and
trying to improve the world. I've been able to become more active
and more outspoken about my beliefs.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: John Gardner Keeps James Bond Alive</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   EDITOR'S NOTE: American writer Alexandra Ripley has the
unenviable job of doing the sequel to Margaret Mitchell's ``Gone
With the Wind.'' For advice, she might turn to John Gardner, the
British thriller writer who took on the task to continue the James
Bond sagas after Ian Flemming's death.

<TEXT>
   John Gardner is not just a thriller
writer but a master of a very special art: the posthumous sequel.
   At his home in this English village west of London, the
61-year-old author writes James Bond novels, having picked up where
007's creator, Ian Fleming, left off when he died in 1964.
   While American writer Alexandra Ripley is just beginning a
sequel to Margaret Mitchell's ``Gone With the Wind,'' Gardner has
already turned out seven Bond novels, each a best seller in the
United States. The most recent, ``Scorpius,'' is in its sixth
consecutive week on the New York Times best-seller list.
   ``It was a challenge, a little honor,'' Gardner recalled of his
decision to accept a publisher's offer in 1979 to write a Bond
sequel.
   He had already made a name with his books about the adventurer
Boysie Oakes, and with such cloak-and-dagger yarns as ``The Dancing
Dodo'' and ``The Nostradamus Traitor.'' He had also written two
novels featuring Sherlock Holmes' nemesis, Professor Moriarty.
   So when Glidrose Publications, Bond's literary copyright owners,
offered him a shot at old 007 himself, he thought, ``Why not? If I
don't do it, somebody else will.''
   Gardner was then living in Ireland as a tax exile, and already
one Bond sequel, ``Colonel Sun,'' had been published in 1968 by
Kingsley Amis, author of such acclaimed novels as ``Lucky Jim'' and
``One Fat Englishman.'' Amis wrote it under the pseudonym Robert
Markham.
   Gardner first encountered Bond while in bed with the flu in the
early 1960s, when his wife, Margaret, brought ``Casino Royale'' and
``Dr. No'' from the library.
   ``I was absolutely enchanted,'' he recalled.
   ``Fantasy, formula, fun are the three F's of Bond writing,'' he
said in an interview.
   The exploits of the suave, self-possessed hero, a man both
dressed and licensed to kill, demand a lot from a writer, Gardner
said.
   The trick, he says, is to make the Bond novels ``look as if
they've been thrown off in one afternoon. ... You can't let readers
see the joints anywhere.''
   ``I sit down to do Bond and within about four days, I'm cutting
lines out and making it run very fast,'' he said. ``Every chapter I
write I have to go back and say, `no, you can take two lines out
there and you can say that in three words.'
   ``It has to be that tight,'' he said. ``These are books to be
read in an airplane or on a beach.''
   His contract calls for two more Bond novels. Under a separate
agreement he is writing the book of the forthcoming ``License
Revoked,'' the first Bond movie not drawn directly from a Fleming
book.
   Movies, Gardner said, pose the greatest obstacle to
sequel-writing.
   ``People remember the movies far better than the books,'' he
said. ``There's a universal myth that Bond drove an Aston Martin.
He didn't, except for a very short time in `Goldfinger.' He drove a
very old Bentley.''
   Gardner said he had tried to bring his champagne-drinking hero
up to date with AIDS and glasnost.
   ``You can make him a man of the '80s, make him adapt to the
women's movement, the strictures under which we live, all that,''
he said. ``(But) I've had to get round the business of him
transporting arms on normal flights, and of course the technology
has changed so greatly.''
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome posed specific problems for
the libidinous Bond. He tried to work in a joke about condoms but
his publishers rejected it.
   Nor is he allowed to give Bond depth: ``I can't in any way
relate to him as a character like I can to my own. Bond is
one-dimensional; that is one of his successes. His novels are kiss
kiss, bang bang adventures.''
   He is reticent about his earnings from the Bond books, saying:
``I get a percentage of a percentage of a percentage. It puts a
tiny bit of jam on top of the money I earn through my other
writing.''
   Gardner's immediate future looks relatively Bond-free. ``Secret
Families,'' the last in a trilogy about espionage from 1910 to the
present day, will appear next May.
   After ``License Revoked'' he plans ``a modern blockbusting novel
a la Jeffrey Archer'' focusing on the life of a symphony conductor.
   Meanwhile, his only advice to such sequel-writers as Alexandra
Ripley is to be faithful to the original, but not unduly so: ``Try
and make it your own.''

<HEAD>Plants Make Pollutants Into Profits</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Under the sunlit arch of a plastic
greenhouse, an artificial swamp of cattails and elephant grass
sprouts from hydroponic troughs, soaking sustenance from a city's
sewage.
   This could be the waste treatment plant of the future.
   Picture it: A natural system that uses microbes and marsh plants
to transform raw sewage into sparkling clean water. Unlike
conventional sewage facilities, which cost a fortune to run, this
one makes money. It leaves no nasty sludge. It creates energy. It's
so pretty it can be used as a park.
   It sounds too good to be true.
   But it's already becoming a reality. Simple plant-based sewage
treatment systems are being used on a small scale in parts of the
South. And researchers are developing more refined and efficient
systems they say could replace aging and inefficient conventional
plants on a large scale within the next decade.
   ``We're looking at a whole new generation of waste treatment
that's cheaper and much more efficient than anything that's
available now, and produces useful resources,'' said William
Jewell, a Cornell University agricultural engineer.
   ``Our goal is to eliminate pollution at a profit,'' Jewell said.
   Beside Ithaca's new $40 million conventional treatment plant,
which settles, aerates and chemically treats about 5 million
gallons a day, he has set up a pilot model of his system with the
capacity to purify 10,000 gallons of sewage a day _ about what 100
people would produce.
   The demonstration is funded by the state energy office and the
Gas Research Institute, a utility-sponsored group trying to find
new sources of natural gas.
   ``It's leaps and bounds ahead of anything that's been done
before, both in terms of energy used and quality of water
discharged,'' said Ron Isaacson, manager of renewable resources for
the Chicago-based institute.
   In Jewell's two-step system, raw sewage is partially cleaned in
a tankful of bacteria, then piped into long, low troughs in a
greenhouse, where it provides a ``nutrient film'' on which plants
thrive.
   The plants are grown hydroponically _ with no soil. Their roots
form a dense mat as they soak up the pollutants.
   ``It's really a solar-powered filter,'' Jewell said on a recent
tour.
   In the first 4-foot-wide tank of cattails, the water is murky
and smelly. By the time it reaches the end of the 250-foot-long
series of tanks, in a few hours, it's clear as a brook and teeming
with tiny snails and other creatures.
   ``These are copepods,'' said Jewell, scooping up a few flitting,
flea-size crustaceans. ``Whenever you see them, you have
tremendously clean water, like in a stream.''
   To make the water safe to drink, however, would take further
treatment that could be done with a more extensive outdoor
hydroponic system, which he plans to build this fall, or with a
conventional filtration and chlorination plant.
   A bonus to plant-based sewage treatment is that methane, sold as
natural gas, is produced by the first-stage bacterial process. More
can be made by harvesting the plants and processing them using the
same bacteria.
   Jewell figures a plant with the capacity to handle the sewage of
10,000 people, about a third the population of Ithaca, could
generate $400,000 worth of methane a year. The system could also be
used to grow flowers and tree seedlings for city parks or
commercial nurseries.
   But even without those products, Jewell said, his system would
cost far less to build and operate than the plants now in use. He
estimates that for a community of 10,000, his system would cost
less than $1 million to build, compared to at least $5 million for
a conventional plant.
   ``And the quality of water produced by our system far exceeds
that achieved by conventional facilities,'' said Jewell.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has sponsored
pioneering plant-based waste treatment projects in towns in
California, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.
   ``These are the wastewater treatment system of the future for
small towns, especially since the federal grant money for sewage
treatment has dried up in the last few years,'' said B.C.
Wolverton, at NASA's National Space Technology Laboratory in Bay
St. Louis, Miss.
   Wolverton's artificial marshes, which use floating plants like
water hyacinths or rooted ones like bulrushes, have treated all the
chemical waste and sewage from the NASA lab for more than 12 years.
``We've saved many millions of dollars by using these systems.''
   Some towns are using Wolverton's sewage marshes as parks, he
said. ``The settling tanks are underground, and they're growing
canna lilies and calla lilies in the channels.''
   Most of the systems that Wolverton has designed are for towns of
fewer than 3,000 people. But an experimental system in operation in
San Diego, using water hyacinths to make potable water from sewage,
is expected to eventually handle a million gallons a day, he said.
   ``There's a desperate need to come up with a new source of water
in the Southwest,'' said Wolverton. ``This could be an answer.''
   Jewell's system in central New York differs in several ways from
Wolverton's. For one thing, it uses greenhouses and hardy plants,
making it feasible for use in northern climes.
   ``A main drawback to plant-based systems has been the climate
limitation,'' said Jim Basilico, chief of the water and pesticide
research division of the Environmental Protection Agency, which
funded early stages of Jewell's project. ``But if it works in
Ithaca, it can work anywhere.''
   Another advantage of Jewell's system is that because of the type
of bacteria it uses it doesn't produce sludge like other hydroponic
systems and conventional plants do. In most systems, organic
pollutants are broken down by aerobic bacteria, which need oxygen.
It costs the nation half a billion dollars a year in electricity to
fill that oxygen need by aerating sewage, said Jewell.
   ``We spend $200 million in New York state alone just to blow
bubbles through settling tanks,'' he said. ``The anaerobic
alternative doesn't use any energy at all. Instead, it produces
energy.''
   Because they are far more efficient at digesting waste matter,
turning 90 percent of it into methane, anaerobes don't produce
sludge like the fast-growing and inefficient aerobic bacteria do.
   ``I've begun to look at methane production as almost a magic
process,'' said Jewell, who is also developing digesters to make
methane from garbage, agricultural wastes and crops like sorghum.
   Other researchers also are looking into systems that use
anaerobic bacteria to turn pollutants into profitable products.
   Peter Benson, who developed the Gas Research Institute's
methane-from-biomass program, has started a venture called
Renewable Energy Systems, Inc., in Palos Park, Ill. He plans to
sell a system that uses anaerobic bacteria to digest municipal
garbage as an alternative to incinerators or landfills.
   ``The toughest nut to crack is inertia,'' Isaacson said. ``It
will just take a few successful demonstrations in a real-world
situation to prove it works and make people comfortable with it.''

   Frank Sciremammano gets seasick and has
more stories about getting stuck in airports than getting stuck at
sea.
   So it may seem surprising that NASA has given him more than
$100,000 in grants the past two years to study the Antarctic Ocean.
   Sciremammano, a professor at Rochester Institute of Technology,
has only actually seen the Antarctic twice, but he believes he
knows as much about it as anyone, thanks to satellites and
computers.
   ``Satellite oceanography is still in its infancy, but more and
more people are getting interested,'' he said. ``When I got started
in 1984 there were really only two or three groups involved.''
   Now, there are textbooks on the subject and seminars held to
discuss new developments in the field that involves sophisticated
radar measurements taken by satellite to study a wide range of
information about the ocean's behavior.
   Sciremammano says satellites can revolutionize some aspects of
oceanography because scientists will no longer be limited to bits
and pieces of data.
   ``The satellites provide a global picture that traditional
methods can't,'' he said. ``You can put instruments in the water
and get a lot of wonderful information, but only about that
particular point.''
   That's especially important in a place like the Antarctic Ocean,
where a dearth of shipping activity makes dropping off measuring
devices expensive and time-consuming. Studying the Antarctic the
traditional way convinced Sciremammano that satellites were the way
to go.
   ``We spent millions of dollars over years, a lot of time and
effort on the part of a lot of people ... and we really got one
data point,'' he said. ``One good picture ... but in a very limited
geographic area.''
   So now, Sciremammano pores over charts and tables, constantly
checks his electronic mailbox and keeps stacks of computer disks in
his office. He's using one-tenth of all of RIT's computer memory to
store the data he gets from space.
   He said his research, which focuses on the nature of the
circumpolar current which swirls around the continent of Antartica,
could someday provide some definitions for the El Nino, an
unexplained weather phenomenon that causes severe droughts and
flooding on both sides of the Pacific Ocean, and for the
much-talked about ``greenhouse effect.''
   ``We're trying to get a whole budget for the earth's heat
balance,'' he said. ``Everybody understands that heat comes in at
the equator and goes out, more or less, at the poles, but the exact
mechanisms for that transfer are not understood.''
   Sciremammano admits that his work _ he teaches mechanical
engineering _ and his landlocked location make him somewhat of an
oddball oceanographer.
   ``That has its advantages. People leave me alone. I don't have
colleagues coming down to tell me about their latest adventure,''
he said. ``But I do feel a little isolated sometimes.''

   Tiny crustaceans that don't behave like your
average desert dwellers may help identify potentially fertile
farmland in arid regions.
   On the barren waste near Moshe Shakah's office at Sde Boker in
the Negev desert, pine, carob and pistachio trees grow without
irrigation in an area that averages only 3{ inches of rain a year.
The reason, Shahak says, is a grayish, segmented, armor-plated
relative of the wood louse known as an isopod.
   The species Shahak is studying _ Helilepistus realuluri _ has a
name longer than its .7-inch-long body.
   ``The isopod has two qualities you'd never expect to find in the
desert,'' says Shahak, a Ben Gurion University desert ecology
specialist who has studied the isopods since 1972. ``Its rate of
water loss is very high and it has an inflexible life routine.''
   To survive, isopod families stick together and work
cooperatively, Shahak says. ``They formed the first kibbutzim in
the Negev.''
   In order to survive the summer, when temperatures soar over 104
degrees, the isopods must find soil with a moisture content of 6
percent to 10 percent. The family _ an adult male and female and up
to 90 offspring _ digs a tunnel up to 27 inches deep, knowing
intuitively where the moisture content of the soil will be high
enough to sustain them, Shahak says.
   As they burrow, the isopods leave a tell-tale mound of chewed-up
soil above ground, indicating their presence and thus the presence
of life-sustaining soil under the hard desert surface, he says.
   Shahak took soil readings to determine the relative density of
isopod habitation and found a direct correlation between the number
of isopods and the presence of moisture in the soil.
   Aharon Yair, a Hebrew University geomorphologist, did hydrolic
examinations of the soil that verified Shahak's research and
contradicted current belief on where to find moisture in the desert.
   Desert specialists had believed that the soil with the highest
water content was found at the bottom of desert valley beds. Yair's
readings showed that isopods dig their holes halfway down the
slopes of the desert hills, at the point where the rock ends and
the soil begins, Shahak says.
   Five years ago, he planted five species of trees based on those
readings; so far, they are flourishing, he said.
   Dr Eliyahu Ravitz, an expert on desert research at Hebrew
University's Faculty of Agriculture, says that while the findings
are interesting, moisture was not the only element that contributed
to soil's fertility, and that most trees need soil with at least 20
percent water content, far more than the 6 percent to 10 percent
needed by the isopods.
   Shahak said there appeared to be enough nitrogen, phosphorus and

<HEAD>Plants Make Pollutants Into Profits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Under the sunlit arch of a plastic
greenhouse, an artificial swamp of cattails and elephant grass
sprouts from hydroponic troughs, soaking sustenance from a city's
sewage.
   This could be the waste treatment plant of the future.
   Picture it: A natural system that uses microbes and marsh plants
to transform raw sewage into sparkling clean water. Unlike
conventional sewage facilities, which cost a fortune to run, this
one makes money. It leaves no nasty sludge. It creates energy. It's
so pretty it can be used as a park.
   ``We're looking at a whole new generation of waste treatment
that's cheaper and much more efficient than anything that's
available now, and produces useful resources,'' said William
Jewell, a Cornell University agricultural engineer.
   Beside Ithaca's new $40 million conventional treatment plant,
which settles, aerates and chemically treats about 5 million
gallons a day, Jewell has set up a pilot model of his system with
the capacity to purify 10,000 gallons of sewage a day _ about what
100 people would produce.
   The demonstration is funded by the state energy office and the
Gas Research Institute, a utility-sponsored group trying to find
new sources of natural gas.
   In Jewell's system, raw sewage is partially cleaned in a tankful
of bacteria, then piped into long, low troughs in a greenhouse,
where it provides a ``nutrient film'' on which plants thrive. The
plants are grown hydroponically _ with no soil. Their roots form a
dense mat as they soak up the pollutants.
   A bonus to Jewell's sewage plant is that methane, sold as
natural gas, is produced by the first-stage bacterial process. More
can be made by harvesting the plants and putting them through a
digester using the same bacteria.
   Jewell figures a plant with the capacity to handle the sewage of
10,000 people could generate $400,000 worth of methane a year. He
estimates that for a community of 10,000, his system would cost
less than $1 million to build, compared to at least $5 million for
a conventional plant.
   ``These are the wastewater treatment system of the future for
small towns, especially since the federal grant money for sewage
treatment has dried up in the last few years,'' said B.C.
Wolverton, at NASA's National Space Technology Laboratory in Bay
St. Louis, Miss.
   Wolverton's artificial marshes, which use floating plants like
water hyacinths or rooted ones like bulrushes, have treated all the
chemical waste and sewage from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration lab for more than 12 years. ``We've saved many
millions of dollars by using these systems.''
   Most of the systems that Wolverton has designed are for towns of
fewer than 3,000 people. But an experimental system in San Diego,
using water hyacinths to make potable water from sewage, is
expected to handle a million gallons a day.

<HEAD>This Oceanographer is No Jacques Cousteau</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frank Sciremammano gets seasick and has
more stories about getting stuck in airports than getting stuck at
sea.
   So it may seem surprising that NASA has given him more than
$100,000 in grants the past two years to study the Antarctic Ocean.
   Sciremammano, a professor at Rochester Institute of Technology,
has only actually seen the Antarctic twice, but he believes he
knows as much about it as anyone, thanks to satellites and
computers.
   ``Satellite oceanography is still in its infancy, but more and
more people are getting interested,'' he said. ``When I got started
in 1984 there were really only two or three groups involved.''
   Now, there are textbooks on the subject and seminars to discuss
new developments in the field that involves sophisticated radar
measurements taken by satellite to study a wide range of
information about the ocean's behavior.
   Sciremammano says satellites can revolutionize some aspects of
oceanography because scientists will no longer be limited to bits
and pieces of data.
   ``The satellites provide a global picture that traditional
methods can't,'' he said. ``You can put instruments in the water
and get a lot of wonderful information, but only about that
particular point.''
   So Sciremammano pores over charts and tables, checks his
electronic mailbox and keeps stacks of computer disks in his office.
   He said his research, which focuses on the nature of the
circumpolar current which swirls around the continent of Antartica,
could someday provide some definitions for the El Nino, an
unexplained weather phenomenon that causes severe droughts and
flooding on both sides of the Pacific Ocean, and for the
much-talked about ``greenhouse effect.''
   Sciremammano admits that his work _ he teaches mechanical
engineering _ and his landlocked location make him somewhat of an
oddball oceanographer.
   ``That has its advantages. People leave me alone. I don't have
colleagues coming down to tell me about their latest adventure,''
he said. ``But I do feel a little isolated sometimes.''

<HEAD>Desert Creature Points Way to Precious Water</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tiny crustaceans that don't behave like your
average desert dwellers may help identify potentially fertile
farmland in arid regions.
   On the barren waste near Moshe Shakah's office at Sde Boker in
the Negev desert, pine, carob and pistachio trees grow without
irrigation in an area that averages only 3{ inches of rain a year.
The reason, Shahak says, is a grayish, segmented, armor-plated
relative of the wood louse known as an isopod.
   The species Shahak is studying _ Helilepistus realuluri _ has a
name longer than its .7-inch-long body.
   ``The isopod has two qualities you'd never expect to find in the
desert,'' says Shahak, a Ben Gurion University desert ecology
specialist who has studied the isopods since 1972. ``Its rate of
water loss is very high and it has an inflexible life routine.''
   In order to survive the summer, when temperatures soar over 104
degrees, the isopods must find soil with a moisture content of 6
percent to 10 percent. The family _ an adult male and female and up
to 90 offspring _ digs a tunnel up to 27 inches deep, knowing
intuitively where the moisture content of the soil will be high
enough to sustain them, Shahak says.
   As they burrow, the isopods leave a tell-tale mound of chewed-up
soil above ground, indicating their presence and thus the presence
of life-sustaining soil under the hard desert surface, he says.
   Shahak found a direct correlation between the number of isopods
and the presence of moisture in the soil.
   Aharon Yair, a Hebrew University geomorphologist, verified
Shahak's data, which contradicted current belief that the soil with
the highest water content was found at the bottom of desert valley
beds. Yair's readings showed that isopods dig their holes halfway
down the slopes of the desert hills, at the point where the rock
ends and the soil begins.
   Dr Eliyahu Ravitz, an expert on desert research at Hebrew
University's Faculty of Agriculture, says that the findings are
interesting, but that most trees need soil with at least 20 percent
water content.
   Shahak said he increased the moisture in the areas pinpointed by
isopods by digging holes to trap rainwater not normally absorbed by
the baked earth.
   He believes his findings could help solve the severe food
shortages caused by extended periods of drought in Ethiopia and
other African nations.
   ``If it works here, it will work in Africa too,'' he said.

<HEAD>Lung Associations Warns on Complications of Hay Fever</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Serous otitis media is cq</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Children with hay fever should be watched for
complications that can lead to hearing loss and headaches, the
American Lung Association warns.
   A child who complains of fullness in the ears and popping
sounds, or who has earaches, may have serous otitis media, the
association says. Such a child may also have a mild hearing loss
that may make him talk louder or fail to pay attention to teachers
or television.
   Serous otitis media is a chronic inflammation of the ear
passages that blocks normal drainage of secretions, providing a
breeding ground for bacteria. If the disease goes untreated,
increased hearing loss may hinder learning and speech development.
   Another hay fever complication, chronic sinusitis, produces
headaches, foul-smelling breath, year-round nasal congestion and a
thick mucousy discharge from the nose. The inflammation of the
sinus cavities can lead to infection.
   Both complications can be treated with medication, the
association says.
   While the risk of serous otitis media declines in adolescence,
the chance of chronic sinusitis from hay fever continues into
adulthood, said association spokesman Robert Lemanske Jr. of the
University of Wisconsin Hospitals in Madison.

<HEAD>Air Force Studies Plan to Launch Rockets From Offshore Platforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force is
studying the use of enormous oil-drilling platforms as offshore
launch pads.
   One plan would be to tow the world's largest type of drilling
platform, known in the oil industry as a Gorilla, into Vandenberg
harbor, load a rocket aboard and tow it several miles offshore. At
the launching spot, the floating platform's legs would be lowered
until it was standing on the ocean floor. The rocket could then be
fueled and launched by remote control from Vandenberg.
   ``SAMTO is interested in pursuing the offshore concept, and this
is one method,'' said Capt. David Blehm of the Air Force's Space
and Missile Test Organization, which is working with the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration to develop a new advanced
launch system.
   Other offshore ideas include launching rockets from a remote
Pacific isle, a ship, a man-made island or one of the Channel
Islands.
   ``There is a certain giggle factor associated with it,'' said
John Pike, associate director for space policy at the Federation of
American Scientists in Washington, D.C. ``On the other hand, why
not?''
   Cutting costs and conserving land at Vandenberg are two
motivations for the offshore plan. The never-used space shuttle
launch pad cost $3.3 billion. A rig offshore supposedly could be
built for $100 million and be connected by cable to existing launch
control facilities.
   Spurring the studies are plans for up to 50 launches a year,
beginning in 1996. Pike said the Strategic Defense Initiative and
planned space station would be potential major users of the
advanced launch system rockets.
   The California Coastal Commission would investigate the impact
on sea life and water quality of offshore launch schemes.

<HEAD>`Pessimistic' View May Predict Poorer Health Decades Later</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pessimism may be bad for your health, a study
suggests.
   The study of 99 men found that those with a pessimistic outlook
about unfortunate experiences around age 25 tended to have poorer
physical health 20 to 35 years later.
   The men had filled out questionnaires in 1946 that asked about
difficult wartime experiences. Independent judges studied the
causes they offered for bad events, ranking them for stability
(such as ``it's never going to go away,'' rather than ``it was a
one-time thing''), globality (``it's going to ruin everything I
do'' vs. ``it has no bearing on my life,'') and internality (``it's
me'' instead of ``it's the heat in this place.'').
   A pessimistic explanatory style ranks high on those three
factors, the researchers from the University of Michigan, Dartmouth
Medical School and the University of Pennsylvania said in
describing study results in the July issue of the Journal of
Personality and Social Psychology.
   Records from physical examinations showed that a pessimistic
explanatory style best predicted poor health at age 45, with less
reliable predictions at ages 50, 55 and 60.
   Among the possible explanations are that people with a
pessimistic style may fail to seek or follow medical advice, or
maybe they neglect basic health care in the first place,
researchers said.
   The men were academically successful, independent and healthy,
so results of the study may not apply to people in general, they
said.

<HEAD>Detector Checks For Brain Waves Of A Lie</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lie detector that measures brain waves would be
more accurate than polygraphs, which measure bodily functions, says
its developer.
   ``It would probably not falsely accuse any innocent people, and
it would probably pick up 70 to 90 percent of guilty people,'' says
J. Peter Rosenfeld, a Northwestern University professor of
psychology and of neurobiology and physiology. ``I think that's
better than existing units.''
   The American Medical Association and the congressional Office of
Technology Assessment have said polygraphs are wrong 15 percent to
50 percent of the time.
   Rosenfeld's lie detector picks up brain-wave activity through
electrodes attached to the scalp, amplifying the signals and
feeding them into a computer, which coordinates the information and
displays it on a video screen.
   ``If sensory information has a special meaning for you ... then
your brain will respond with a special kind of trough called the P3
wave,'' he said.
   In tests at Northwestern, subjects have been asked to look at a
series of words, most with no special meaning. ``Occasionally,
they'll see a word that is meaningful, like some anti-social act
they're involved in _ cheating on tests or using drugs _ which is
sometimes the case here,'' Rosenfeld said.
   ``When they see terms like that, their brain waves break into P3
waves.''
   Polygraphs measure the physical expression of emotions _ pulse,
sweating, blood pressure and breathing, he said.
   Advertising researchers have measured P3 waves to better gauge
what consumers want instead of what they say they want, and
psychiatrists can detect certain disorders, such as attention
deficits, by measuring them, he said.
   Rosenfeld has worked on the detector for almost four years and
says it could be widely used within three more. He published a
study last year and will publish another this summer in the
International Journal of Neuroscience.
   ``It's a perfectly valid way of detecting lies,'' said Sidney
Weinstein, a professor of neurology at New York University College
of Medicine in New York City and editor of the Danbury, Conn.-based
neuroscience journal.
   However, a brain-wave lie detector would probably cost 10 times
as much as the $500 to $600 for a polygraph, and the operator would
need a great deal more training, Weinstein said.

   A record number of American corporations changed
their names during the first six months of 1988, with financial
institutions and manufacturing companies heading the list,
according to a corporate identity survey.
   Of the 931 name changes, 53 percent were because of mergers and
acquisitions, the survey by Anspach Grossman Portugal Inc. found.
Another 21 percent stemmed from divestitures, spinoffs, leveraged
buyouts and sales of assets, the survey showed.
   But some companies created new names hoping for a new corporate
image, said the report released today.
   Last year, 1,753 corporations changed their names, 919 in the
first half.
   ``Special circumstances apply to every name change situation,''
said Joel Portugal, a principal of Anspach Grossman Portugal.
``It's difficult to generalize, to say real names are better than
created names or vice versa.''
   Eighteen of the newly named companies are listed on the New York
Stock Exchange, including three whose names became initials during
the first half of 1988. Allegis Corp. returned to UAL Corporation;
Bell Canada Enterprises Inc., changed to BCE, Inc.; and Sealed
Power Co. became SPX Corp.
   Three Japanese corporations operating in the United States
simplified their names: Konishiroku U.S.A. changed to Konica U.S.A;
Nippon Kogaku became Nikon Corp.; and Nippon Kokan America is now

   Some known names disappeared during the first half of the year.
Standard Oil is now BP America after a merger; and Diamond Crystal
Salt has become DSLT Inc. after selling its salt operations.

   The dollar steadied in moderate but nervous
trading in Europe today in response to what appeared to be
concerted central bank intervention. Gold prices rose.
   The central banks of West Germany, Switzerland, Italy, the
Netherlands and Belgium intervened, selling dollars in the open
market when the U.S. currency reached 1.8435 West German marks
early today, dealers said.
   The amount of intervention was not known, but it was sufficient
to put a lid on the dollar's advance, traders said.
   ``I think the dollar is a bit high. Some profit-taking will
prevent it from moving much higher,'' a trader in Rome said.
   But another Rome trader said he expected the dollar to continue
its advance.
   ``For now, the market is going only in one direction,'' he said.
   He added that some profit-taking was likely this week ahead of
the U.S. trade figures for May, to be released Friday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.36 Japanese yen to a closing 133.33
yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 133.31 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Friday's

Swiss francs, up from 1.5295; 6.1925 French francs, up from 6.1820;

   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.6978, compared
with $1.7015 on Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $438.90 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $438.50. At mid-morning today, the

Trading ranged between 133.10-133.65 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average index of
25 selected issues, the market's main barometer, closed today at
27,985.99 points, up 68.91 points, or 0.24 percent.
   ``There is a strong wait-and-see attitude in the market,'' a
trader with a major Tokyo brokerage said. ``But the rise in the
Nikkei reflected the market's overall energy.'' The Nikkei index
was a 188.95-point winner Friday.
   Volume on the market's first section was 1.1 billion shares,
down from 1.4 billion traded Friday. Only 400 million shares were
traded on the first section during the afternoon session, when
foodstuffs, constructions and real estates were being sought.
   Traders said the market was nervous about higher interest rates,
and showed concern about reports today that analysts expect the
U.S. Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy and perhaps raise
the official U.S. discount rate this week.
   Exchange dealers were believed to be reacting to improved
economic indicators in the United States, including the jobless
rate, which fell 0.3 percentage points in June.
   An exchange dealer at a major commercial bank in Tokyo said the
dollar also rose on a comment by an unidentified U.S. government
official Friday that Washington would tolerate the greenback's rise
to about 135 yen.
   The dollar came close to that level last Monday, reaching 134.80
yen, its highest closing since late November.

   Stock prices were narrowly mixed Monday as
concerns about inflation crept back into the market.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 selected issues
was up 0.2 point, or 0.01 percent, at 1,877.4 at midday.
   Volume was light at 223 million shares, compared with 340.9
million shares at the same time Friday.
   Dealers reported a modest amount of two-way business by
institutions. The best gainers were the international stocks,
helped by the dollar's advance on foreign exchange markets. But
profit-taking eroded the price of some stocks that posted good
gains late last week.
   Dealers said the market was showing a delayed reaction to
Friday's surprisingly sharp drop in U.S. unemployment figures. The
figures depressed Wall Street late last week but left London
equities unscathed amid bullish sentiment generated by a major
order for British military equipment by Saudi Arabia.
   ``People are getting very worried the Americans are going to
start bumping up their interest rates because of inflation
worries,'' one dealer said.
   Consequently, ``we may well have to put up our interest rates to
keep sterling where we want it,'' he added.

<HEAD>Seed Corn Companies Look to South America In Drought</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Analysts say there should be no shortage
of seed corn for next year's crop even if this year's drought
decimates 1988 yields, but seed corn producers aren't taking any
chances.
   With Midwest fields withering, American seed corn companies are
looking south for crops this winter to replenish their stockpiles.
   ``We are looking in Texas, Argentina and Chile,'' said Joan
Olson, a spokeswoman for Northrup King Co., one of the top five
seed corn producers for the U.S. market.
   The nation's largest seed corn producer, Pioneer Hi-Bred
International of Des Moines, is negotiating for more corn
production in Chile and Argentina if the U.S. drought results in
crop widespread crop failure, said Owen Newlin, a senior vice
president at the company.
   He said Pioneer already grows seed for the local market in South
America, and has processing plants that can shell and dry corn
there.
   ``We will be increasing their capacity considerably,'' Newlin
said.
   He added that after pollination of the U.S. seed corn crop in
about two weeks the company will decide how much production it will
need from South America, as well as from Florida and Texas.
   ``We haven't got all of our plans firmed up,'' Newlin said. ``We
don't really know how bad things are going to be here.''
   DeKalb Corp., the second-largest seed corn producer in the
United States, still expects to ``get a crop in the U.S. large
enough'' to meet its needs, said spokesman Bob Pritchard.
   But he noted that the company has a processing plant in Chile,
and ``obviously we're considering all the options.''
   Despite the drought, there are no predictions of shortages of
seed corn for next spring.
   About a fourth of hybrid seed corn is grown under irrigation,
and enough leftover seed sits in company warehouses to plant up to
half of this year's corn acreage again, observers say.
   But a short harvest this year will likely result in expanded
planting next year. Many seed corn companies expect 1989 corn
acreage to increase 10 percent to 15 percent.
   ``I think there will be ample seed corn to plant, but a good bit
of it will be lower quality simply because it's carry-over,'' said
Craig Carver, a stock analyst with Dain Bosworth in Minneapolis.

<TEXT>
   The British retailer Ward White Group PLC said
Monday it requested information from Payless Cashways Inc. about
the U.S. home-improvement store chain.
   Ward White said it might make a takeover bid for the Kansas
City, Mo.-based Payless Cashways, although the British company's
interest in an acquisition currently is at a low level, Philip
Horwath, Ward White's company secretary, said.
   ``We were just requesting information as a fact-finding
operation, that's all,'' Horwath said. ``We are on the outlook for
acquisitions in the United States in that field and we do request
information from companies from time to time and there is nothing
particularly exceptional about it.''
   Last month, Payless Cashways accepted a sweetened management
buyout offer of $908.8 million, or $27 a share. The offer, led by
Payless Chairman David Stanley, was designed to thwart a possible
takeover attempt by New York investor Asher Edelman.
   Ward White, which is based in Wellingborough, Britain, already
operates 160 do-it-yourself automotive retail outlets in the United
States through its White Plains, N.Y.-based Whitlock Corp. division.
   In Britain, Ward White operates 93 Payless DIY Ltd. stores which
sell building materials and furnishings, and 370 Halfords Ltd.
stores which sell automotive accessories.
   Payless Cashways has 200 stores in 26 states.

   Stock prices edged upward today in a sluggish
start to a midsummer week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.07 to 2,107.22 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 552 up, 380 down and
465 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to just 16.06 million shares as of
10 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said traders were looking ahead optimistically to
earnings reports for the second quarter, the bulk of which will be

   News Friday that the unemployment rate fell to a 14-year low in
June reinforced hopes on Wall Street that many companies' results
for the second quarter would benefit from unexpected strength in
the economy.
   That same momentum, however, is also considered likely to cause
the Federal Reserve to think harder about tightening credit soon.
   Interest rates were mostly steady in early credit-market
activity today.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jackie Presser vowed five years ago to clean
up the Teamsters Union. He didn't succeed, according to government
prosecutors, but Presser breathed new life into the nation's
largest union, returned it to the mainstream of the American labor
movement and, just maybe, helped put it on a path towards reform.
   Presser, 61, died Saturday night at a suburban Cleveland
hospital after a battle with cancer, two months after giving up the
reins of the 1.6-million-member union to Weldon Mathis, the No. 2
official and Presser's apparent choice as his successor.
   While Presser himself had been the subject of 14 criminal
investigations and was under indictment when he died, his moves to
put Mathis in control were consistent with a career-long effort to
repair the Teamsters' image.
   Mathis, 62, has never been linked with any organized crime
figures. And except for nepotism that is common to many unions, he
is free of scandal.
   Presser had initiated a change in the union's constitution in
1986 so that Mathis, rather than First Vice President Joseph
Trerotola of New York, would become interim president.
   Trerotola, 70, has never been indicted. But many of the hundreds
of local Teamster officials that prosecutors have pursued over the
past dozen years have been under his jurisdiction as head of the
union's Eastern Conference in New York and New Jersey.
   Mathis was empowered as the Teamsters' acting president for 120
days or until early September. Starting out as a business agent for
a Teamster local in Atlanta, he climbed his way through the union's
hierarchy over 38 years.
   When Presser passed the reins to Mathis on an interim basis,
Trerotola led a boycott by half of the 16 executive board members
at the first meeting convened afterwards, setting up a possible
challenge to him.
   No permanent successor to Presser will be chosen until after his
funeral Tuesday, labor officials said. But labor insiders doubt a
successful challenge to Mathis can be mounted.
   ``Jackie may have decided it when he yielded the power for four
months,'' one source said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
   Walter Shea, the Teamster's chief policy operative in Washington
with the soft-spoken demeanor of a State Department diplomat, is
said by union insiders to have the most support for challenging
Mathis.
   Several other of the 16 union vice presidents also would like
the job, although the only ones with sufficient support for
mounting a challenge are Joseph Morgan of Hallandale, Fla., and
Arnie Weinmeister of Seattle, according to sources in the union.
   Based on who attended the May meeting that Mathis convened in
Arizona, he is still believed to have the necessary nine-vote
majority, including his own, for winning the top job.
   The only way he could be denied the union presidency would be if
all his potential rivals united behind a single challenger.
``That's the big question,'' said one Teamster insider.
   Presser died just two weeks after the government, in a
first-ever suit of its kind, moved to place control of the entire
union under a court-appointed trustee.
   Among the government's claims were that Presser, Mathis and the
Teamsters' 16 board members were controlled by organized crime or,
at best, unwilling or incapable of removing the Cosa Nostra's
domination over the union's affairs the past three decades.
   Presser denied ever being under mob control, but it was a fine
line that he walked, remembering the disappearance of former
Teamsters chief Jimmy Hoffa after his release from jail and bid to
reassume control of the union.
   ``If you're totally honest and try to clean up the union and you
try to do it fast enough and without making accommodations so the
government won't get you, the other guys _ the hoods _ will get
you,'' he said of the Teamsters' presidency in a 1977 interview.
``It's a death chair either way.''
   Despite Presser's death, the government will pursue its takeover
suit, U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani of New York said Sunday.
   Presser himself was under indictment for allegedly participating
in a ghost employee payroll-padding in which some $700,000 from a
Cleveland Teamsters local that he also headed was funneled to
organized crime figures.
   Armed with reams of government documents showing Presser to have
been an informant for both the FBI and the Internal Revenue
Service, his attorneys had prepared an elaborate defense on the
premise that any wrongdoing was done under the auspices of the
government.
   Altogether during his 40-year union career, Presser was the
subject of at least 14 criminal probes. But unlike past Teamster
chiefs given the same scrutiny, Presser believed in using public
relations to counter the union's image as corrupt.
   As an Ohio Teamster leader during the early 1970s, Presser was
widely credited with reducing the power of organized crime figures
through his own aggressiveness in contract bargaining. And in 1977
he persuaded then-Teamster President Frank Fitzsimmons to establish
a large public relations apparatus and put him in charge of it.
   Taking over as president in 1983, Presser immediately began to
polish the international union's image. He was the first Teamster
president in modern times to testify voluntarily before a
congressional committee.
   Presser promised senators he would try to cleanse the union of
corrupt influences but cautioned ``there's no way I can be a
policeman.''
   Earlier this month, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the ranking
Republican on the Senate Labor Committee, credited Presser with
bringing ``honorable'' people into the union's hierarchy and
helping clean up the Central States Pension Plan.
   ``Mr. Presser, regardless of what anybody else may think of him,
has lived up to every promise he made to me,'' Hatch said. ``There
is no one person who can straighten it all out.''
   Last year, while convalescing from cancer treatments, Presser
guided the Teamsters back into the AFL-CIO after 30 years of bitter
rivalry between the two groups.
   He turned the Teamsters' political action fund into the biggest
campaign chest of any group in the country, and the computer
network he purchased to keep financial tabs on every company with a
Teamsters contract is the most sophisticated in the labor movement.
   Presser also replaced much of the union's headquarters staff
that had grown moribund under Hoffa's successors, Fitzsimmons and
Roy Williams.
   ``Fitzsimmons was on the golf course all the time and Williams
stayed in Kansas City,'' one veteran Teamster official recalled.
``Jackie came in and started taking names. He wanted to know
everything that was going on. All of a sudden the Teamsters were a
union again.''

   Representatives of the 151 member nations of
the World Bank, the biggest source of aid to the Third World, are
expected to approve an increase to $500 million of its reserves
against possible loan losses, a bank official said Monday.
   The official, who spoke on condition he not be named, said the
increase was recommended by bank president Barber B. Conable.
   The bank approves loans worth about $17 billion every year.
   Eight countries are more than six months in arrears on their
repayments to the bank, an unprecedentedly large number. They are:
Nicaragua, Guayana, Liberia, Syria, Peru, Sierra Leone, Zambia and
most recently, Panama.
   In the past, the bank has only put up reserves against
prospective losses when a country was two years overdue on its
repayments. Under the new decision, the reserves would be set up
when a country is six months late.
   The U.S. government owns the largest block of shares in the
bank, which earns about $1 billion annually.
   The bank has approved an increase in its capital to enable it to
raise its lending in the 1990s.

Under the promotion, adult passengers who begin their trips in
Louisville, Ky.; Buffalo, N.Y.; and the Wisconsin cities of Green
Bay and Madison will be eligible for children's excursion fares on
tickets purchased in July for travel during off-peak periods
through Sept. 11.
   On a flight from Green Bay to Houston, for example, the fare
would be reduced from $348 to $158 under the promotion.
   In 500 other markets, Northwest has cut its MaxSaver fares, the
lowest discount tickets available. Northwest said the new fares
take effect immediately.
   In 17 markets, Northwest has trimmed its round-trip discount
fares by more than $100. The biggest savings is available for a
round trip between Albany, N.Y., and Tulsa, Okla., where the fare
has been cut from $368 to $218.
   Fares in nearly 300 other markets have been reduced by at least
$40. The discount fares carry restrictions.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Plunge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened sharply lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction to substantial
weekend rains in some key growing areas of the drought-stricken
Midwest.
   Prices of some contracts for future delivery of corn, oats and
soybeans dropped their limits for daily trading immediately after
the opening bell. Wheat also was sharply lower.
   ``It's all because of the improved weather,'' said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``We had a
foreshadowing of this last week when the grains sold off, and over
the weekend we had the rains.''
   Weekend showers brought relief to parts of Wisconsin, Michigan,
Indiana and Iowa, where some areas received up to five inches of
rain.
   Lespinasse said private forecasters expected scattered showers
to continue in the Midwest for the next couple of days, which
should keep the pressure on grain futures prices.
   Cautious trading was expected ahead of Tuesday's special crop
report from the Agriculture Department, which will provide
planted-acreage totals and revised supply-demand projections.
   In early trading, wheat was 9{ cents to 13 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.85 a bushel; corn was 14}
cents to 15 cents lower with July at $2.95{ a bushel; oats were 10
cents to 12 cents lower with July at $2.81 a bushel; soybeans were
31 cents to 42{ cents lower with July at $8.82 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly higher while pork futures were mostly
lower in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .55 cent lower to .53 cent higher with August
at 65.55 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .23 cent to 1.05 cents
higher with August at 75.30 cents a pound; hogs were 1.35 cents
lower to .05 cent higher with July at 45.40 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .20 cent to 1.40 cents lower with July at 32.80
cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mixed and pork futures finished lower on
Friday.

<TEXT>
   Beecham Group PLC, a major British pharmaceuticals
company, said Monday it sold its last U.S. cosmetics business,
Beecham Cosmetics Inc., for $91.5 million.
   The buyer of Beecham Cosmetics, which owns the Jovan and
Vitabath brands, is a consortium organized by the division's
management and Bankers Trust Co. of New York.
   The sale marks the completion of Beecham Group's withdrawal from
the U.S. cosmetics business, although it still has interests in
pharmaceuticals and toiletries in the United States. It sold its
Germaine Monteil and Diane von Furstenberg cosmetics businesses in
the United States in March 1987.
   A Beecham spokeswoman, who spoke on condition that she not be
identified, in accordance with British practice, said the company
decided to withdraw because its cosmetics interests were not large
enough to compete adequately in the U.S. market.
   Beecham intends to concentrate on developing its pharmaceuticals
and toiletry business in the United States, she said.

   A secretary at the Machinists union local
office here said today that she has been fired after picketing the
building for almost two weeks in a contract dispute.
   Cheryl Gaal, who had worked in the union office for 12 years,
said the union's executive committee voted to dismiss her Sunday
night.
   ``They fired me for exercising my right to strike,'' said Ms.
Gaal. ``I don't think that's very smart for a labor organization.''
   Ms. Gaal had gone on strike against the Machinists to demand
more pay for performing jobs that she said were the duties of union
officials, not the office secretary. She demanded more money and an
upgrade to administrative aide, but the union refused.
   Union officers were forced to cross her solo picket line to
enter the Local 971 headquarters, which principally serves local
Pratt & Whitney employees.
   She said her own union, the Office and Professional Employees
International, had supported her strike.
   Ms. Gaal says she is looking into filing both unfair labor
practice and sex discrimination charges against the local.
   Telephone calls to the Machinist union headquarters this morning
were not answered.
   Previously, local President Fred Thorpe said it was not fair to
pay Ms. Gaal, who was earning $13.55 an hour, more than members of
the Machinists union.

   The MGM movie and television production
company will be split off from MGM-UA Communications Co. by
majority owner Kirk Kerkorian in a restructuring worth $400
million, it was announced today.
   Investor Burt Sugarman and two movie producers will acquire 25
percent of MGM, formerly the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures studios,
with its familar roaring lion logo. Kerkorian will retain at least
57 percent.
   MGM-UA stock was off $1 a share at $14.75 in midday trading,
after formal announcement of the deal by MGM-UA and Sugarman's
Barris Industries Inc.
   Rumors of a sale or restructuring have been circulating for
weeks. The transaction announced today was first reported Sunday in
the Los Angeles Times.
   Sugarman, the Beverly Hills investor who recently failed to gain
control of Media General Inc. of Richmond, Va., in a bitter proxy
battle, will team up with movie producers Jon Peters and Peter
Guber to buy 25 percent of MGM.
   Present stockholders of MGM-UA will be offered the right to buy
new MGM stock for $8 a share, the same price paid by the Sugarman
group.
   Kerkorian, holder of 82 percent of MGM-UA, will exercise all his
subscription rights to the new MGM stock, and will buy any MGM
stock which isn't purchased by others, the announcement said.
   That will give Kerkorian at least 57 percent of MGM as well as
retaining controlling interest in the original company, to be
renamed United Artists.
   Under the arrangement, MGM-UA will sell 50 million shares of new
stock in MGM for $8 a share. Of the proceeds, $100 million would
come back to MGM and the rest would be used to repay MGM-UA debt.
   Both companies will continue to produce movies and MGM will have
a 50 percent share in the present MGM-UA distribution system. The
deal is expected to close in the fall, the companies said.
   MGM's library of 3,000 movies was sold to Turner Broadcasting
System Inc. in 1986 for more than $1 billion, and its studio lot
was later sold to Lorimar-Telepictures Corp. The deal is expected
to close in the fall, the companies said.
   Guber will be MGM's chairman and chief executive officer and
Peters will be president and chief operating officer. The pair has
produced such movies as ``The Color Purple,'' ``Witches of
Eastwick'' and ``Caddyshack.''
   Peters and Guber manage Barris Industries, producer of TV's
``The Newlywed Game'' and ``The Dating Game.''
   A hint that further shuffling may be in the offing was contained
in a company statement attributed to MGM-UA president Stephen
Silbert: ``We are still considering further transactions which, if
they come to fruition, could result in MGM-UA's stockholders being
offered the opportunity to dispose of all or part of their shares.''
   MGM-UA, which has endured several quarters of losses, produced
the successful movie ``Moonstruck'' and TV's ``thirtysomething.''
It has a library of 1,000 titles, including the ``Rocky'' and
``Pink Panther'' movies.

   Prices on the London Stock Exchange slipped Monday
as traders awaited several British and U.S. economic reports due
this week.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 0.4
point, or 0.02 percent, to 1,876.8.
   Trading volume was 416 million shares, down from Friday's 598
million shares.
   Dealers said there was little incentive to open new positions in
advance of the economic reports. On Friday, reports are to be
releases on the British retail price index for June and the U.S.
trade figures for May.
   Until then, activity likely would remain slow, dealers said.
   ``This is a big week for indicators,'' said Jeremy Evans, market
strategist at County NatWest WoodMac in London.

   Textron Inc. announced Monday it plans
to sell its Raycon unit to George Fischer Corp. of Mount Prospect,
Ill. for an undisclosed amount.
   The sale is expected to close sometime this month, Textron
officials said.
   According to Textron, Raycon is among the leading producers and
distributors of electrical discharge machines worldwide and also
develops and markets industrial laser systems.
   Raycon was founded in 1965 and became part of Textron after the
Ex-Cell-O acquisition in 1986. The company employs 160 people at
its manufacturing facilities in Ann Arbor and Owosso, Mich.
   Textron has operations in aerospace technology, commercial
products and financial services.
   Textron earned $256 million on revenue of $7.2 billion in 1987,
but does not break figures for the Raycon unit, said spokesman
Raymond W. Caine Jr.
   George Fischer Corp. is a subsidiary of Georg Fisher AG of
Schaffhausen, Switzerland. The Swiss company was founded in 1802
and employs 14,500 people _ 500 of them in the United States. Its
businesses include foundries, piping systems, manufacturing
technology and plant engineering and construction.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures dropped to their lowest
levels in about a month Monday as weekend rains in the thirsty
Midwest prompted a third straight day of plummeting prices on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   Most contracts traded down their daily limits within minutes of
the opening bell. The contracts for July delivery, on which the
limits have been removed pending their July 20 expiration,
continued to trade _ generally lower.
   July soybeans fell 66 cents a bushel to $8.58, the lowest price
for that contract since June 3. Corn for July delivery dropped 20{
cents to $2.89 a bushel, the lowest level since June 15.
   Weekend showers that brought widespread relief to Midwestern
croplands eased fears of drastic yield reductions, analysts said.
   Some private forecasters expected scattered showers to continue
in the Corn Belt for the next couple of days, which should keep the
pressure on grain futures prices, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   But, he cautioned, ``if the weather goes back to hot and dry,
and that persists for a week or 10 days, we will go back up again.
One rain does not make a crop.''
   At the close, wheat was 16} cents to the limit 20 cents lower
with July at $3.68 a bushel; corn was 12{ cents to 20{ cents lower
with July at $2.89 a bushel; oats were 14{ cents to 27 cents lower
with July at $2.66 a bushel; soybeans were 38 cents to 66 cents
lower with July at $8.58 a bushel.

<HEAD>Lyng Says Drought Could Prompt Relaxed Crop Acreage Controls Next
Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The drought may force the government to ease
crop acreage controls next year to help the United States rebuild
its grain inventories, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said
Monday.
   But the United States ``will continue to be a major player'' in
world agriculture and in 1989 ``should be able to bounce back''
from this year's drought losses, he said.
   Lyng's remarks were prepared for delivery at a meeting of farm
magazine, extension, advertising, co-op and broadcast editors.
   A larger portion of the United States suffered from some degree
of drought stress in May and June than at any point since records
began in 1895, he said.
   Moreover, on July 2, about 35 percent of the contiguous United
States was in the ``severe to extreme'' drought category, he said.
In 1934, more than 60 percent was so rated, and in August 1954 more
than 50 percent was in that category.
   ``Because of the large early season area now experiencing
drought in the U.S., 1988 appears to have the potential to approach
or exceed the drought-affected areas of the 1930s and 1950s,'' Lyng
said.
   Even with the severe drought, there will be an adequate supply
of food grains and livestock feed grains so that the United States
``will be able to take care of our domestic needs and our export
demand,'' he said.
   Lyng said total consumption of 1988 crops will probably be
somewhat less than previously estimated because prices are much
higher.
   ``But it is important to note that we will have no shortages,
that we will still be able to accommodate the needs of our overseas
buyers,'' he said.

<HEAD>Consumers Used $2.84 Billion in Coupons To Shop in 1987</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shoppers traded in $2.84 billion worth of
coupons in buying food, pharmaceuticals and other consumer goods
last year, a 6 percent increase from 1986, a marketing firm
reported Monday.
   But of the 215.2 billion coupons distributed by companies to
promote their products, more than 208 billion went unused,
according to a study by Manufacturers Coupon Control Center, which
is a subsidiary of Dun & Bradstreet Corp.
   Slightly more than 3 percent of the total, or 7.15 billion, were
redeemed, which was a fraction ahead of 1986, the report said.
   ``The lack of strong growth this year reflects a maturing
industry,'' the study said. ``After several years of innovative
marketing techniques, including using coupons to introduce new
products, couponing has achieved a level of penetration that makes
significant growth in the immediate future unlikely.''
   While the number of coupons redeemed leveled off, their average
value increased 14 percent, to 39.7 cents from 37.6 cents, the
report said.
   Since 1983, coupon distribution has grown 51 percent and last
year more than 2,000 companies used coupons to promote their
products and boost sales, the report said. During the same period,
the number of coupons redeemed grew by 29 percent.
   Newspaper inserts continued to be the most popular form of
coupon distribution in 1987, while all other media forms, except
direct mail, declined, the report said.
   Grocery coupons inside and outside product packaging tended to
be the most popular with consumers, with a 14 percent and 13
percent redemption rate, respectively, compared with other methods
of distribution.
   Grocery coupons contained in Sunday newspaper inserts were
redeemed at a 3.6 percent rate and those printed inside newspapers
averaged 2 percent, the study found.

   Anheuser-Busch Companies Inc. said
Monday it plans to build a $300 million brewery near here that will
employ more than 450 workers upon completion.
   Chairman August A. Busch III said at a luncheon that the plan
``reflects our confidence in the future of our company, and in the
kind of leadership and business climate we have found in
Cartersville and the state of Georgia.''
   Anheuser-Busch officials said 1,000 workers will be employed at
the peak of construction of the brewery.
   Hiring of the permanent work force will begin early in 1990, and
the brewery is expected to be completed in the spring of 1992. The
brewery will employ more than 450 workers, the company said.
   The brewery will be the St. Louis-based company's 13th brewing
facility in the United States, with the capability of producing up
to 6 million barrels of beer a year. The facility will primarily
serve Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee but also will supply beer to
other Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic states.
   Anheuser-Busch and its subsidiaries recorded gross sales of more
than $9 billion in 1987. In addition to brewing, its subsidiaries
include baking and frozen food products, container manufacturing,
family entertainment and the St. Louis Cardinals baseball team.

<HEAD>Designers, Retailers and American Express Join Forces in New Ad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's almost like a mini-catalog: A magazine
advertisement offers designer clothing and accessories that readers
can order immediately from some of the nation's top retailers by
using the American Express card.
   The main thrust of the seven-page ad, which appears in the
August issue of Elle magazine, is that you can use American Express
for retail purchases. But it also gives consumers a chance to do
some one-time shopping at three upscale stores that are getting
some big national exposure.
   One section of the ad shows wool separates by Crisca that can be
ordered by phone from Burdine's. Another displays watches by
Raymond Weil and cosmetics by Stendhal that can be bought from
Macy's, while a third offers Bruno Magli shoes and a shoulder bag
available at Neiman Marcus.
   Each of the models in the ad holds an American Express card, and
each page reminds consumers the merchandise can be paid for with
the card. The Macy's and Burdine's sections additionally note
toll-free telephone numbers readers can call to place their orders.
   The ad is an extension of traditional cooperative advertising,
in which a product is prominently displayed while a retailer's name
is noted in comparatively small print, often at the bottom of a
page.
   Elle, an upscale women's magazine, carries traditional coop ads.
In its July issue, for example, two ads for Yves Saint Laurent note
that the French designer label is available at Neiman Marcus, Saks
Fifth Avenue or I. Magnin.
   What's different about this newest ad is the prominent display
of the retailers and the charge card along with the merchandise. It
looks like a catalog, it gives the consumer a chance to buy an
advertised item immediately and it tells the shopper how to do it.
   The ad accomplishes several objectives for retailers.
   It offers them a chance to further their upscale image by
associating themselves with designer merchandise and with American
Express, which is perceived as a prestige card, said Joseph
Ronning, a retail industry analyst with the investment firm Brown
Brothers Harriman Inc.
   The ad also gives the retailers a chance to pick up some
business from customers outside their immediate areas and generate
future sales, Ronning said.
   Burdine's, for example, has 27 stores in Florida, and it is
likely that readers in far-off states would, after seeing the ad,
shop in one of its stores during a vacation, he said.
   The ad is also a way for consumers to find that if they have an
American Express card, they can still shop at a store even if they
don't have the retailer's own credit card.
   ``For all of them, it's important to tell the customer you can
use your AmEx card here,'' Ronning said.
   But the one with the most to gain from the ad is American
Express, which is wants to establish itself as a retail charge
card, and not just a travel and entertainment card.
   In recent months, American Express has tried to move in on the
retail turf traditionally held by Visa and MasterCard. The company
is offering incentives for cardholders to buy merchandise with the
card, including 90 days of insurance on every retail purchase made
through American Express.
   The Elle spread, done by the advertising agency Cabouli Inc., is
an extension of coop ads American Express took out with restaurants
in the past, said Keith Hark, a spokesman for American Express. He
said all the companies named in the latest ad contributed toward
its cost, but he declined to say how much any one of them paid.
   Jim Dunaway, director of information for the Newspaper
Advertising Bureau, a trade group, said American Express is
``trying to build the sale into their advertising.''
   Dunaway compared the Elle display to ads American Express has
placed on newspaper weather pages. Travelers, who are likely to
consult those pages, could be inspired to use their charge cards
during their trip, he said.

<HEAD>Reynolds Closes Grand Rapids Extrusion Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reynolds Metals Co. will close its
Grand Rapids plant, which produces auto bumper parts and other
extruded products, by the end of the year, the company said Monday.
   The plant will begin phasing down operations immediately, said
C. Stephen Thomas, vice president and general manager of the
Reynolds Extrusion Division.
   Thomas said Reynolds will work with state and local government
agencies to help find new employment for the plant's 275 hourly
employees and 61 salaried employees.
   It was unknown whether any of the Grand Rapids plant employees
would be transferred to Reynolds' other extrusion plants, in
Bellwood, Va., Louisville, Ky., and Torrance, Calif., company
spokeswoman Lou Anne Nabhan said.
   About 98 percent of the hourly employees and a large percentage
of the salaried employees are vested in the company's pension plan
and many are eligible for early retirement, Thomas said.
   Thomas said employees had agreed to wage and benefit reductions
in recent years to cut operating costs.
   ``Yet, after several years of effort to make the facility more
competitive and to stem continuing operating losses here, we have
no alternative to today's action,'' he said.
   The age of the plant _ built by the federal government in World
War II, leased to Reynolds in 1946 and purchased by the company in
1949 _ was cited as a major factor in its closing.
   Nabhan said it was not known when the first reductions in the
work force would occur. No decision had been made on disposition of
the site, buildings or equipment.

<HEAD>Major Central Bankers Agree On New Capital Requirements</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BASEL, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Central bankers from leading
industrial countries agreed Monday on common standards for the
minimum capital reserves that banks must hold.
   The accord ``will help to strengthen the soundness and stability
of the international banking system and will remove an important
source of competitive inequality for banks arising from differences
in national supervisory requirements,'' said Karl Otto Poehl,
president of West Germany's central bank.
   It represents ``a significant step forward in international
supervisory cooperation,'' he said after the meeting at the
headquarters of the Bank for International Settlements.
   The new standards detail a framework for measuring capital
adequacy and set a minimum reserve standard for each country's
authorities to put into force.
   A BIS committee chaired by Bank of England associate director
Peter Cooke completed the draft proposals last December.
   Swiss and British banks, which already have high capital
requirements, are expected to benefit particularly from the new
rules. Banks in France and Japan generally will have to boost their
reserves because their countries have relatively lenient
requirements.
   Central bankers endorsed a target capital ratio of 8 percent of
a bank's assets, to be achieved in each country by the end of 1992.
At least half of a bank's capital base counted toward the standard
must consist of equity capital and published reserves from
after-tax retained earnings.
   Central bankers from the Group of 10 major industrial countries
and Switzerland attended Monday's meeting.
   The Group of 10 includes Belgium, West Germany, France, Britain,
Italy, Japan, Canada, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United States.

   Financially troubled Heck's Inc. said
Thursday it would close 35 of its 120 discount department stores as
part of a federal bankruptcy court reorganization plan.
   Company spokesman Bill Bragg said the affected stores were in
West Virginia, Virginia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio and
Pennsylvania.
   Bragg said the stores being eliminated were closed Saturday for
inventory. He said they would reopen later this week for
liquidation sales.
   Federal Bankruptcy Judge Ronald Pearson last week gave Heck's
permission to close 40 stores.
   The company said it would eliminate 700 to 1,000 jobs by closing
the stores, which company President John Isaac said ``have
demonstrated in the past and present that they have not contributed
to the company.
   A disclosure form filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission earlier this year said Heck's, which has lost $94.5
million since December 1983, had closed 53 stores since December
1986, not counting the 35 closings announced Thursday.
   The Nitro-based chain had a high of 166 stores in 1985.

   Stock prices crept ahead in quiet trading
Monday, getting off to a sluggish start on a midsummer week.
   Analysts said declines in commodity prices and interest rates
worked in the market's favor, but failed to stir up any great signs
of enthusiasm among traders.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.16 to 2,111.31.
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 759 up, 682
down and 522 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 123.30 million
shares, down from 136.07 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 143.83 million shares.
   Analysts said traders were looking ahead optimistically to
earnings reports for the second quarter, the bulk of which will be
issued over the next two to three weeks.
   News on Friday that the unemployment rate fell to a 14-year low
in June reinforced hopes on Wall Street that many companies'
results for the second quarter would benefit from unexpected
strength in the economy.
   That same momentum in business activity has stirred talk that
the Federal Reserve would think harder about tightening credit soon.
   But interest rates declined slightly in credit-market activity
Monday as prices of many key commodities tumbled. Word of weekend
rains in the Farm Belt sent farm commodity prices lower, in
particular.
   Gainers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, up ] at 126}; Philip Morris, up 1[ at 86{; General
Electric, up { at 43}, and Coca-Cola, up | at 37{.
   But American Telephone & Telegraph slipped [ to 26]; General
Motors was down ] at 77], and Eastman Kodak lost [ to 44|.
   Careercom was one of the day's bi$ggest percentage losers,
falling 1| to 13. The company said it had ended preliminary talks
about a possible merger, although its investment bankers continue
to study ways to ``maximize shareholder value.''
   Unocal, discussed as a possible takeover candidate by analysts
quoted in the New York Times, climbed 1| to 37[.
   Sun Electric rose 1[ to 18. An investment group whose takeover
advances have been resisted by Sun said it was interested in
acquiring the company with or without the approval of Sun's
management.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $2.50 billion, or 0.09
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.21 to 153.02.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose .53 to 312.81, and S&P's
500-stock composite index was up .53 at 270.55.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dipped .18 to 394.15. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 308.58, down .44.

<HEAD>Dollar Up Against Some Currencies; Gold Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar climbed to recent highs against
several major currencies Monday in choppy domestic dealings after
posting gains earlier in Europe despite concerted central bank
intervention.
   Gold prices fell sharply.
   The dollar reached its highest point since last October against
the British pound and West German mark. It reached its highest
point since last August against the French franc and Italian lira.
   Led by West Germany's central Bundesbank, intervention began
early in the European trading session. West Germany, which stepped
in sporadically to sell dollars throughout last week, was
accompanied by the central banks of Switzerland, Italy, the
Netherlands, Austria, and Belgium, dealers in Europe said.
   The Federal Reserve also was believed to have sold dollars, but
the U.S. currency continued to resist the downward pressure.
   ``It's a general feeling that U.S. interest rates are going
higher and that there is progress in the trade deficit,'' one
London trader said in explaining the dollar's apparent strength in
the face of intervention.
   If the Federal Reserve pushes up interest rates to keep the
economy from overheating, dollar securities would become more
attractive to foreign investors.
   Earl Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust and Savings Bank
in Chicago, said the total amount of dollars sold during the
interventions was rumored to be in the neighborhood of $1 billion,
which he characterized as not particularly excessive considering
the number of banks involved.
   Traders in New York said the market was buffeted throughout the
session by mixed messages regarding the level of the U.S. currency.
   ``There were rumors to the effect that the Bundesbank is not
looking for an appreciation of the mark, that the Bank of Japan and
the (Fed) are happy with the level of the dollar,'' said John
McCarthy, a vice president and trader at Irving Trust Co.
   But on the bearish side, McCarthy cited former White House
economic adviser Martin Feldstein's prediction that the dollar
would trade at 100 Japanese yen within three years.
   ``When you get these arbitrary statements, people get positioned
badly and they bail out of the market,'' McCarthy said. ``It was a
yo-yo day where people were caught both ways.''
   Traders said they expected some skittishness in the market ahead
of the government's release on Friday of the merchandise trade
report for May.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 1.36 yen to a closing 133.33 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at the lower rate of 132.96 yen. In New York
the dollar closed at 133.07 yen, down from 133.29 yen on Friday.
   The dollar appreciated against the British pound. In London, it
cost $1.6900 to buy one pound, cheaper than Friday's $1.7015. In
New York, one pound fetched $1.6925, less expensive than $1.6996 on
Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday:
1.8423 West German marks, up from 1.8415; 1.5305 Swiss francs, down
from 1.5325; 6.2065 French francs, up from 6.1945; 1,367.25 Italian
lire, up from 1,364.50; and 1.2072 Canaidan dollars, down from
1.2091.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday:
1.8460 West German marks, up from 1.8378; 1.5350 Swiss francs, up
from 1.5295; 6.2080 French francs, up from 6.1820; 2.0750 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.0605; 1,364.50 Italian lire, up from 1,355.50;
and 1.2082 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2095.
   Gold prices fell in Europe after New York traders began selling
platinum during the European afternoon. Dealers in Zurich said the
downward slide appeared limited, and predicted that new buying
would emerge.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold closed at $434.60 a troy
ounce, down from $439.10 on Friday. Republic National Bank of New
York said gold was bid at $434.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT,
down from $439 late Friday.
   In London, gold finished at a bid price of $435.10 a troy ounce,
down from late Friday's $438.50, while in Zurich, the bid price was
$435.50, down from $439.50 Friday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose
96 cents to close at a bid $442.04.
   Silver on New York's Comex finished at $6.937 a troy ounce, down
from $7 on Friday. In London the metal was quoted at a late bid
price of $6.94 a troy ounce, down from Friday's $7.01.

<HEAD>More Withdrawn Than Deposited In Savings Institutions In May</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Savings institution depositors withdrew more
money from their accounts than they deposited in May for the first
time in seven months, while losses continued to erode the ailing
industry's capital, the government said Monday.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said net withdrawals at the
nation's 3,102 federally insured S&Ls totaled $941 million in May.
But the decline came after seven consecutive months of net deposit
gains totaling $28 billion.
   Through the first nine months of last year, thrift institutions
were troubled by what industry analysts called a ``slow-motion
run'' as uncertain depositors withdrew their money.
   However, after the October stock market crash, investors pulled
their money out of risky stock investments and put it into insured
S&L and bank acounts.
   James Barth, chief economist at the bank board, said there was
no obvious explanation for the May deposit drain, but he noted that
commercial banks and money market mutual funds experienced a
similar decline.
   Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., industry analyst, said S&Ls appear
to be trying to resist the rise in interest rates and thus are
attracting fewer deposits.
   Meanwhile, thrift institutions' capital _ the difference between
what they owe in liabilities and own in assets _ shrank by $303
million in May after falling $392 million in April.
   Capital numbers are closely watched because they can provide a
good indication of industry losses, which totaled a post-Depression
record $7.6 billion last year and $3.8 billion for the first three
months of this year.
   The May capital shrinkage was smaller than declines in all but
one of the previous 12 months, but Ely noted that capital tends to
shrink the most in the third month of every quarter when many
institutions credit interest earnings to depositors.
   ``We're not going to get a read on the second quarter until we
see how June turns out,'' he said.
   Savings institutions closed $21.1 billion in mortgage loans in
May, up from $19.1 billion in April but down sharply from $24.6
billion a year ago. Barth attributed the decline to a drop in
refinancing activity.

   Ford Motor Co. is extending through Oct. 5 its
buyer incentive offerings, which had been scheduled to expire on
Wednesday, the No. 2 automaker announced Monday.
   Unlike General Motors Corp., which trimmed rebates on many of
its vehicles in a similar extension two weeks ago, Ford made few
changes.
   Ford reduced rebates on the Mustang with 2.3-liter engine and
manual transmission to $500 from $750; on the Ford Taurus and
Mercury Sable to $500 from $600; and on Ford Tempo and Mercury
Topaz to $400 from $500.
   Other rebates _ ranging from $300 on Ranger S compact pickup
trucks, Festiva and 1988 Ford Escort, to $1,000 on Ford Thunderbird
Turbo Coupe and Mercury XR-7 _ remain unchanged.
   Ford said it was continuing the incentive program to keep its
dealers competitive but noted that sales were strong and
inventories low on many models.

<HEAD>Hasbro Agrees to Purchase Certain Assets in Coleco Lines</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hasbro Inc. announced Monday it has
agreed to purchase certain assets of the indoor-outdoor children's
furniture and ride-on divisions of financially troubled Coleco
Industries Inc. for $21 million.
   Under the agreement, Hasbro officials said it will purchase
specific assets, including inventory and tooling, machinery and
equipment and some property rights.
   Hasbro will also buy two manufacturing facilities in Amsterdam,
N.Y., officials said, where the acquired product lines are produced.
   The lines include plastic wading and splashing pools, pool
filers, children's outdoor furniture and clubhouses, and pedal- and
battery-operated cycles.
   Those lines, which helped launched Coleco in the toy business in
1956, had sales last year of $77 million. The toymaker is based in
West Hartford, Conn.
   ``The addition of these products will provide additional balance
and stability to our overall line,'' said Hasbro chairman Stephen
Hassenfeld in a printed release.
   The agreement is subject to approval by the board of directors
of both companies.
   The deal has been a topic of speculation for more than a month.
   Coleco has been trying since March without success to
restructure its massive debt.
   The company had proposed exchanging $335 million of bonds for a
combination of new bonds and stock, saying the exchange would save
it millions of dollars a year in interest payments and supply cash
for the business.
   When that plan collapsed, Coleco received short-term financing
from a group of 12 foreign and domestic lenders, to which it owes
$103 million.
   The company produces such well-known toys as Cabbage Patch Kids
dolls and Scrabble board games. It lost $47.4 million in the first
quarter that ended April 2. It has lost money in four of the past
five years, including $215 million in the last two years.

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines on Monday reported a 15.7 decline
in June passenger traffic in what the company called a reflection
of the continued ``downsizing'' of the financially pressed carrier.
   Revenue passenger miles _ the amount of miles flown by paying
passengers _ were down 18.6 percent for the first six months of
1988 compared to the first half of 1987.
   Spokeswoman Paula Musto noted that available seat miles in June
dropped 14.1 percent, while capacity from January through June was
off 13.5 percent over last year.
   ``There's no question it's part of a trend. Eastern has been
downsized,'' she said. ``Of course, you would like to have the
airline grow.''
   The company, which wants to cut labor costs by some 30 percent,
blames union intransigence as a major reason for cutting back on
its flights.
   The June figures were 2.53 billion revenue passenger miles
compared with 3.00 billion a year ago, on capacity of 3.98 billion
available seat miles this year and 4.63 billion in June 1987.
   Six-month traffic this year was 15.64 billion revenue passenger
miles, down from 19.20 billion the year before, while capacity was
25.44 billion available seat miles against 29.40 billion.
   Eastern lost $241 million last year and reportedly is losing $1
million a day.
   Meanwhile, the company took out full-page newspaper ads Monday
in Miami, New York, Washington, Boston, Atlanta and Philadelphia
calling attention to last week's management-labor agreements to
improve communications and discussion of safety concerns.
   The ad carried the heading, ``Hope for a breakthrough.''
   ``Given the stiff financial challenges facing the company, it's
clear that a successful future depends on the quick resolution of
our labor contract negotiations over economic issues _ and anything
that improves the environment between management and labor can only
help in these ongoing efforts,'' said the ad, the latest in a
series of full-page advertisements taken out by both sides.

<HEAD>NJ Insurer Draws Heat From State Regulators Over Drought Insurance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New Jersey insurance company has drawn the
ire of drought-suffering farmers and state regulators who say the
insurer appears to be backing off an offer to provide drought
insurance.
   Insurance officials in at least three states _ Minnesota,
Indiana and Ohio _ are looking into the policies offered during a
six-week period in May and June by Federal Insurance Co., a
subsidiary of Chubb Group Insurance Cos. of Warren, N.J.
   ``People are in a panic out here,'' Keith Kendall, an
administrative officer for the Indiana Insurance Department, said
Monday. ``They were lined up around the block to buy this stuff.''
   The company is offering to return premiums to farmers, saying
sales of the policies exceeded its coverage capacity. But officials
in Minnesota and Indiana warned that Chubb could possibly lose its
license to do business in those states if it did not provide the
coverage.
   Essentially, the policy offers coverage for crop damage due to
below-average rainfall. Depending on the policy, the less rain that
falls, the more money is paid.
   Chubb said the policy is a variation on the type of coverage
offered to outdoor-event promoters insuring against a rain-out.
   Chubb said Monday that only about 40 policies actually had been
issued out of thousands of applications filed May 1 to June 17. The
company said Federal's insurance agent, Good Weather International,
which developed the policy, was authorized to provide only up to
$22.5 million in coverage in the Farm Belt states.
   Shortly before the enrollment period expired, news stories about
the drought and Good Weather's marketing brought on a flood of
applications, Chubb spokeswoman Mary Lu Korkuch said. About 8,000
to 9,000 applications had come in since June 17, she said.
   ``We are still seeking to determine the magnitude of coverage
requested above the capacity limit which we are committed to, and
we are working to develop a proposal to state insurance
commissioners about how to best manage the situation,'' she said.
   State regulators said Chubb promised to underwrite hundreds of
millions of dollars in policies. The company would not comment on a
figure, but Kendall said Chubb had $50 million in Indiana policies
alone.
   Chubb sent out letters over the weekend to insurance agents
offering refunds to farmers who sent in premiums in exchange for
canceling the contracts, Ms. Korkuch said.
   Kendall criticized the company's stance that it had no
obligation to provide insurance to applicants. He noted that the
period covered by the policies was limited to June, July and August
and said that to offer refunds five weeks after the beginning of
the period was unfair.
   ``We're going to get Federal to stand behind all applications
solicited in the state of Indiana,'' he said.
   The state's insurance commissioner, Harry Eakin, said over the
weekend that about 1,700 Indiana farmers had signed contracts for
the coverage, paying $15 million to $20 million in premiums for
coverage. He set a hearing for July 26 to determine whether Good
Weather or Federal acted unfairly or deceptively.
   In Minnesota, officials said Chubb should issue drought policies
to about 1,000 farmers there.
   A 1987 state law says that if a farmer's premium check is
cashed, as has happened in most Minnesota cases, the policy cannot
be canceled by the company or farmer, officials said.
   State and company representatives in Minnesota plan to meet to
discuss the issue.
   In Ohio, Peg Ising, an assistant director to the state insurance
division, said, ``We're looking at the situation in Ohio at the
present time.''
   Most crop insurance is backed by the U.S. Agriculture
Department's Federal Crop Insurance Corp., which has an April 15
application deadline and covers a range of natural afflictions at
once.
   Few companies provide coverage for specific problems _ such as
drought. Ms. Korkuch said Chubb had been doing so for three or four
years.
   Chubb apparently had been having trouble finding a company to
offer reinsurance, said Eric Edgington, a spokesman for Federal
Crop Insurance Corp.
   ``In years like this, only Uncle Sam has pockets deep enough,''
he said.

<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices tumbled to their lowest levels in more
than five weeks Monday as weekend rains in the parched Midwest
prompted a third straight day of plummeting grain prices on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   Trading on other commodities exchanges also featured extreme
price movements. Cattle futures soared while most pork futures were
sharply lower; sugar took a hard hit; platinum plunged its daily
limit, leading other precious metals down; energy futures sank; and
stock-index futures advanced.
   In Chicago, prices on most corn, oat and soybean contracts fell
their daily limits within minutes of the opening bell. But the
contracts for July delivery, on which the limits have been removed
pending their July 20 expiration, continued to trade _ generally
lower.
   July soybeans dropped 66 cents a bushel to $8.58, the lowest
settlement price for that contract since June 3. Corn for July
delivery dropped 21\ cents to $2.88\ a bushel, the lowest level
since June 15.
   Weekend showers brought fairly widespread relief to Midwestern
croplands, easing fears of drastic yield reductions and spurring
profit-taking in the trading pits, analysts said. Forecasts for
more rain in the Corn Belt later this week forced further
reductions in the market's estimate of prospective grain values.
   Oat futures prices reached a record $3.94 a bushel on June 28.
Corn for near-month delivery hit $3.59 a bushel on July 5.
   But experts say soybeans, which have fallen about 22 percent
since reaching a 15-year high of $10.99{ on June 23, still could
rally beyond that point.
   ``Soybeans generally go through the major pod-setting stage from
the end of July through August,'' said Cathy Leow, an analyst with
Thomson McKinnons Securities in New York. ``We did not get enough
rain to bring the crop back and basically we're still in a weather
market.''
   ``It all depends on the weather,'' agreed Victor Lespinasse, a
trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``Unless the weather goes
back to its previous very hot and dry pattern over a wide area,
we're not going to go back up.
   ``But if the weather goes back to hot and dry, and that persists
for a week or 10 days, we will go back up again,'' he said. ``One
rain does not make a crop.''
   In a 6-to-10-day outlook issued after the close, the National
Weather Service predicted temperatures and rainfall closer to
normal in the Midwest for the first half of next week.
   Cautious trading was expected Tuesday ahead of an Agriculture
Department report on planted-acreage totals and revised
supply-demand projections.
   Wheat settled 16} cents to 19} cents lower with July at $3.68 a
bushel; corn was 13 cents to 21\ cents lower with July at $2.88\ a
bushel; oats were 15 cents to 27 cents lower with July at $2.66 a
bushel; soybeans were 44 cents to 66 cents lower with July at $8.58
a bushel.
   Cattle for near-month delivery surged the 1.50-cents-a pound
limit on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in reaction to lower grain
prices and strong packer demand, said Charlie Richardson, an
analyst in Denver with Lind-Waldock & Co.
   Near-month cattle futures had fallen in recent weeks as grain
prices rose, reflecting widespread producer selling of cattle due
to high feed prices. But Richardson said many traders believe
cattle futures have bottomed out.
   Pork futures were down sharply to limit-down due to concerns
about the nation's large hog herd, he said.
   Live cattle were .30 cent to 1.50 cents higher with August at
66.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .60 cent to 1.50 cents
higher with August at 76.02 cents a pound; hogs were 1.50 cents
lower to .10 cent higher with July at 45.47 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were 1.40 cents lower to .40 cent higher with July at
32.70 cents a pound.
   Sugar futures fell in sympathy with soybeans on New York's
Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange, where the October contract settled
.54 cent lower at 13.39 cents a pound.
   Platinum sank its $25 limit on the New York Mercantile Exchange
in reaction to lower grains, a stronger dollar and an apparent
easing of racial tensions in South Africa, said Bernard Savakl,
metals analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New York. The October
contract settled at $552.30 a troy ounce.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled $4.50 to $4.60
lower with August at $436.40 a troy ounce; silver was 6.3 cents to
6.7 cents lower with July at $6.937 a troy ounce.
   Near-month crude oil prices tumbled 68 cents a barrel on the
Nymex to the lowest close since late 1986, hurt by a selloff that
traders blamed on too much supply and renewed skepticism about
OPEC's ability to restrain production.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 67 cents to 73 cents
lower with August at $14.78 a barrel; heating oil was 1.97 cents to
2.06 cents lower with August at 41.33 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 1.04 cents to 1.99 cents lower with August at 52.13
cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures gained on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for September delivery of the Standard & Poor's
500 index settled .90 point higher at 272.45.

<HEAD>Dow Jones Announces Slight Rise In Second-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dow Jones & Co. Inc., publisher of the Wall
Street Journal, reported Monday it had slightly higher earnings for
the second quarter despite a drop in revenue for its business
publications.
   The company attributed the decline in its publications unit to
decreased financial advertising following last October's stock
market crash.
   Net income for the three months ended June 30, was $49.5 million
compared with $49.1 million in the year-ago period, the company
reported. Earnings per share of 51 cents remained unchanged.
   Overall revenue rose 32.2 percent to $413.8 million from $313.05
million, while revenue for the company's business publications
segment declined 8.2 percent to $201 million from $218.9 million,
the company said.
   Operating income, up 27.5 percent for the company as a whole in
the second period, fell 31.2 percent in its financial publications
unit.
   The company said its quarterly revenue increase was due largely
to the consolidation of the financial results of Telerate Inc., an
electronic information system, into Dow Jones, which owns 56
percent.
   Profits for the first half of 1988 increased 32.2 percent to
$153.1 million, or $1.59 a share, from $115.8 million, or $1.20 a
share, from the same 1987 period.
   The company said first-half profits included a one-time
after-tax gain of $64.5 million, or 67 cents a share, from the
February sale of the company's book-publishing subsidiary, Richard
D. Irwin Inc. Dow Jones said it had recorded an after-tax gain of
$29.4 million, or 30 cents a share, from the sale of its interest
in South China Morning Post Ltd. in the first half of 1987.
   Dow Jones also publishes Barron's, the Far Eastern Economic
Review, among other publications.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices rose modestly Monday in quiet
trading following a week of steady decline. Analysts said the
market drew some support from lower commodity prices.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond advanced about \
point, or $2.50 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which
moves inversely to its price and is often an indicator of interest
rate trends, declined to 9.06 percent from 9.09 percent late Friday.
   The yield on the 30-year issue had risen steadily since July 1,
when it stood at 8.83 percent.
   ``The big thing is nothing happened,'' said Ward McCarthy, chief
financial economist for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. ``This
market was a big yawner.''
   The only development of note, he said, was that bond values were
boosted slightly by steep falls in the prices of oil and farm
commodities _ which quelled inflationary fears. Inflation is a key
enemy of bond prices, since it tends to erode the value of
fixed-income securities.
   Crude oil prices tumbled 68 cents a barrel to the lowest close
since late 1986, while grain and soybean futures dropped to their
lowest levels in about a month.
   In addition, lower bond prices from the previous week attracted
some bargain hunters, said Elizabeth Reiners, a vice president at
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   At the Treasury's latest bond auction, meanwhile, interest rates
on short-term government securities rose to the highest level since
the October stock market crash.
   The Treasury sold $6.6 billion in three-month bills at an
average discount rate of 6.72 percent, up from 6.57 percent last
week. Another $6.6 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 6.99 percent, up from 6.75 percent last
week.
   The rates were the highest since Oct. 19, when three-month bills
sold for 6.84 percent and six-month bills averaged 7.21 percent.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues were unchanged to 1-16 point higher, intermediate
maturities gained 1-32 point to 3-32 point, and 20-year issues
jumped 9-16 point, according to figures provided by Telerate Inc.,
a business-information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, rose 1.26 to 1,141.76.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, edged up 0.39 to 282.83.
   In corporate trading, industrials and utilities rose \ point in
light activity, according to the investment firm Salomon Brothers
Inc.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills, meanwhile, fell 4 basis
points to 6.61 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a
percentage point. Six-month bills also lost 4 basis points, at 6.93
percent, while one-year bills slipped 1 basis point to 7.23 percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 7 9-16 percent, up from 7 7-16
percent late Friday.

<HEAD>CPC's Profit Up 45 Percent in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CPC International Inc. said its
profit jumped 45 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier,
boosted in part by growth in its consumer food and corn refining
operations.
   The food conglomerate said its second-quarter profit rose to $72
million, or 91 cents a share, from $49.8 million, or 61 cents a
share, in the second quarter of 1987.
   The earnings gain occurred despite a decline in second-quarter
revenue, to $1.23 billion from $1.32 billion a year earlier.
   In the first six months of the year, CPC earned $130 million, or
$1.64 a share, up from $92.5 million, or $1.13 a share, in the same
period last year. Revenue for the six-month period fell to $2.31
billion from $2.52 billion in 1987.
   The figures do not reflect a special gain of $126 million from a
restructuring last year that included the sale of European
operations and interests in Asian companies.
   The strength of European currencies against the dollar, a lower
debt burden and lower U.S. tax rate contributed to the
second-quarter earnings performance, said Chairman James R. Eiszner.
   ``For the year 1988 we now expect that CPC's earnings per share
will show an increase of 30 percent or more, excluding the special
gain in 1987,'' Eiszner said.
   The drought gripping the nation's Farm Belt probably will not
have a significant impact on earnings because more than half of
CPC's revenue comes from operations in 47 foreign countries, he
said.
   The company's brands include Hellmann's mayonnaise, Mazola corn
oil and margarine, Skippy peanut butter, Thomas' English muffins,
Arnold breads, Mueller's pasta products, Karo and Golden Griddle
syrups, and Knorr soups and sauces.

   House Speaker Jim Wright said Monday he hopes
that a relief package with disaster payments of up to $100,000 for
drought-stricken farmers will win committee approval and be ready
for floor action in Congress this week.
   ``The relief shall be targeted to those who need aid the most _
primarily family farmers,'' Wright, D-Texas, told reporters.
   He also said that ``there should be no windfalls for major
corporations and wealthy individuals'' in the package being
fashioned by the House and Senate Agriculture committees. He said
disaster payments should be capped at $100,000 for each individual.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., called for
expedited action but added that he remains uncertain about just
what features should be included or what snags might exist. ``If we
can agree on a bipartisan drought package, I would like to see us
do that this week,'' Byrd said.
   But Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate
Agriculture Committee, told reporters following a White House
meeting with President Reagan that Congress should not rush
legislation through recklessly.
   ``I don't think anybody should put artificial deadlines on it,''
he said. ``The important thing is that you tell people that are
about to go bankrupt that there is hope, that there will be
planting and raising herds next year. ... I think we're all agreed
that that's going to be the goal. It's going to be a bipartisan
piece of legislation and one that the president can sign.''
   ``We would like to have this bill ready for House consideration
bfore this week expires,'' Wright said. ``If this should prove
impossible, we shall plan to vote during the week of July 26.''
   ``The drought of 1988 is one of the hottest and driest spells of
continuous weather on record,'' Wright said. ``It affects almost
all agricultural regions of the country, particularly the Northern
Plains states, the Corn Belt and the Mississippi Delta.''
   He said the relief bill being drawn up would make farmers in
more than 1,880 counties in 37 states that have been called
disaster areas eligible for payments from the government.
   As outlined by Wright, government-held hay and feed grains would
be made available to livestock producers up to a value of $50,000
per individual. The drought has wiped out a substantial amount of
hay in the Farm Belt and, as a result, feed is now at a premium.
   Under the bill, Wright said, drought-stricken farmers would not
be required to refund to the government so-called deficiency
payments they have received in advance.
   Deficiency payments are income supports provided to farmers by
the government. They represent the difference between market prices
and congressionally set target prices, which are adjusted annually
by the secretary of agriculture.
   As estimates of this year's harvest have grown smaller, crop
prices have increased accordingly. As a result, the gap between
market prices and target prices has diminished and the size of
deficiency payments for many farmers also has shrunk.
   Forty percent of these payments, however, have already been made
in advance. As things stand, some of these farmers would be obliged
to refund to the government a portion of their advance deficiency
payment at a time when the drought has robbed them of a crop to
take to market.
   Wright said the legislation would encourage the Farmers Home
Administration to restructure loans and delay collection from
drought victims.
   Wright cautioned that consumers should be protected under the
legislation and livestock producers should be provided with
immediate relief.
   ``The bill cannot be a budget buster,'' Wright said. ``To the
extent possible, it should be paid for out of the savings the
government is anticipating from lower deficiency payments.''
   Tentative provisions sketched in by congressional sources said
the measure would cancel the 50-cent cut in dairy price supports
scheduled for next year.
   Payments for wheat, feed grains, cotton and rice farmers would
equal 65 percent of expected earnings for any losses greater than
35 percent of yields.
   For example, corn growers would be paid at a rate of 65 percent
of the target price of $2.93 a bushel or $1.90 a bushel. Payments
would start once a farmer suffered a loss of more than 35 percent
of the historical yield that he has established with the
Agriculture Department.
   A corn grower with 100 acres and a historical yield of 100
bushels would receive a payment of $12,350 as a disaster payment if
his crop were wiped out.
   It remains unclear, however, just how much might be saved in
deficiency payments as a result of the drought. And the savings
will not merely be from smaller deficiency payments. Heightened
demand is emptying government grain bins, thus lowering substantial
storage costs borne by taxpayers.
   Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., said Friday that budget savings
due to the drought would be at least $5.3 billion through fiscal
1990 and could top $10 billion. Lawmakers have been talking about
recycling some or all of these savings to distribute to
drought-stricken farmers as disaster payments.
   The extent of the drought damage remains uncertain. Lawmakers,
farmers and policy-makers are awaiting Tuesday's official crop
production estimates from the Department of Agriculture. They
should offer the best available guide to the magnitude of the
destruction caused by fierce heat and lack of rainfall in the
midcontinent.

   The $400 million split of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
studios from MGM-UA Communications Inc. may not be financier Kirk
Kerkorian's last shuffle involving the two big Hollywood names,
MGM-UA's president indicated Monday.
   ``We're still considering further transactions,'' said Stephen
Silbert, president and chief operating officer of MGM-UA, which
announced Monday it would spin off its MGM unit.
   Kerkorian, who controls 82 percent of MGM-UA, will end up with
at least 57 percent of the new MGM and 25 percent will go to a
company controlled by investor Burt Sugarman and two movie
producers, the companies said. The rest will be offered for sale to
public holders of MGM-UA stock, with Kerkorian buying anything left
over.
   MGM-UA, maker of the Oscar-winning movie ``Moonstruck'' and
popular TV series ``thirtysomething,'' has had several losing
quarters and Kerkorian acknowledged in April he was considering
selling all or part of the company.
   Silbert declined to say what the next move might be, but said
the MGM sale was ``a separate, free-standing transaction,'' and
wasn't part of some larger deal.
   Analysts suggested the deal's primary value was to raise money
to pay off MGM-UA's debt, and the company's stock closed at $15 a
share Monday, down 75 cents from Friday's close.
   The transaction recreates MGM, known for its roaring lion logo,
as a separate, publicly held producer of movies and television
shows. The company will be run by producers Jon Peters and Peter
Guber, major shareholders in Sugarman's Barris Industries Inc. and
makers of ``The Color Purple'' and ``Witches of Eastwick.''
   MGM will get a 50 percent interest in the present MGM-UA
distribution network. Barris and Kerkorian's investment vehicle,
Tracinda Corp., will each appoint half the MGM board.
   MGM-UA, to be renamed United Artists Corp., will also make
movies and TV shows, and has a library of 1,000 movies including
the ``Rocky'' and ``Pink Panther'' series.
   The transaction, expected to close in the fall, calls for
issuing approximately 50 million shares of new stock in MGM, to be
sold for $8 a share.
   Barris Industries will buy 25 percent of the new stock for $100
million.
   Present holders of MGM-UA will get rights to buy the rest, and
Kerkorian has agreed to exercise all his rights, giving him at
least 57 percent of the new MGM. Kerkorian also will buy any shares
that aren't bought by MGM-UA public shareholders, the companies
said.
   Under the arrangement, MGM-UA will sell 50 million shares of new
stock in MGM for $8 a share.
   Of the proceeds, $100 million would come back to MGM and $300
million will be used in part to pay off its $230 million bank debt,
Silbert said. He added that up to 9 million new shares will be
issued for sale to Barris in employee stock option plans.
   In Kerkorian's last shuffle of the companies in 1986, MGM's
3,000-film library, including such classics as ``Gone with the
Wind'' and ``The Wizard of Oz,'' was sold to Turner Broadcasting
Systems Inc. for $1.3 billion and the MGM studio lot was sold to
Lorimar-Telepictures Corp.
   MGM will own ``Moonstruck'' and other movies produced under the
MGM-UA label since 1986.
   Analysts said the deal allows Kerkorian to pump cash into United
Artists while retaining an interest in the well-known MGM name.
   ``Every company would probably jump at the opportunity to
recapitalize and get rid of their debt,'' said Jeffrey Logsdon of
the Crowell Weedon & Co. investment firm in Los Angeles.
   Guber and Peters joined forces with Sugarman last year by
merging their private production firm with his Barris Industries
Inc., maker of TV's ``The Newlywed Game'' and ``The Dating Game.''
   Guber said the MGM name will add luster to movies he and Peters
have in the works, including ``Batman'' starring Jack Nicholson and
``Rainman,'' with Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise.
   ``To have the opportunity to be part of that terrific tradition
and to be able to bring it to another level is a once in a lifetime
opportunity for us,'' Guber said.

   Knight-Ridder Inc. will buy Dialog Information
Services Inc., the world's biggest electronic information retrieval
company, for $353 million from Lockheed Corp., Knight-Ridder
announced Monday.
   Dialog, which had revenue of $98 million last year, has more
than 91,000 subscribers in 86 countries, and collects information
from more than 320 databases.
   ``The acquisition of Dialog represents a significant increase in
Knight-Ridder's commitment to electronic information services and
doubles the size of our rapidly expanding business information
services division,'' said James K. Batten, president and chief
executive officer of Knight-Ridder.
   David K. Ray, president of the company's business information
services division, said the Dialog acquisition would complement
existing Knight-Ridder databases.
   ``Dialog has been a pioneer in the electronic information
businesses and is an industry leader in terms of number of
customers, revenue, size, breadth and depth of database,'' Ray said.
   The sale was expected to be completed in the third quarter.
   Knight-Ridder is a national information and communications
company with operations that include broadcasting, publishing,
cable television and information services.
   Lockheed has received a number of inquiries about selling Dialog
over the past year and a half, said spokesman Hud Englehart in the
company's Calabasas, Calif., headquarters.
   ``It's a matter of having a very interested buyer making a very
attractive offer,'' Englehart said, noting the sale price was 3{
times Dialog's annual revenue.
   In 1987, Dialog had a pretax profit of $17 million on revenue of
$98.1 million.

<TEXT>
   Apollo Computer Inc. announced Monday
two new low- to mid-range workstations designed to enhance efforts
to recapture its position in the business computer marketplace.
   The two systems, the Series 4500 and Series 3500 workstations,
give Apollo a new product line with an upgraded computer chip that
could seriously challenge industry leader Sun Microsystems Corp. of
Sunnyvale, Calif., several analysts said.
   Apollo has been losing its market share for two years to Sun and
other manufacuturers of workstations, powerful computers for single
users.
   The 3500 will be only the second workstation to offer a powerful
computer chip developed by Motorola of Austin, Texas. But analysts
note the price for the 3500 is about half of the $15,000
workstation by Hewlett-Packard Inc. using the Motorola chip.
   The $19,000 Series 4500, which is nearly twice as powerful as
the Apollo Series 4000 workstation introduced last year, is so far
the only system offering an extra-fast Motorola presently being
tested, according to Apollo.
   Both the 3500 and 4500 systems are scheduled to be available in
December, the company announced Monday.
   In over-the-counter trading, Apollo fell 12{ cents a share to
$10.75 on volume of 1.6 million shares.
   ``This is the last piece of the puzzle,'' said Apollo
spokeswoman Donna Ruane. ``With the new low- and mid-range systems,
it sets us up for a period of new growth.''
   On March 1, Apollo announced the $70,000 Domain Series 10000, a
high-powered workstation targeted for specialized technical
customers. Ruane said sales have so far been slow on the 10000,
which is scheduled to be shipped later this year.
   Jennifer Johnson, an analyst at International Data Corp. in
Framingham, said Apollo's introduction of the Motorola chip should
make significant gains in its competition with Sun.
   Yet Johnson warned Apollo may be too confident of increased
sales.
   ``The most significant aspect of the announcement is that they
leap-froged Sun with the Motorola chip ... It's a very good product
line and Apollo is being aggressive, but they are keeping the price
down, planning to get high (sales) volume. They might be getting a
bit too over aggressive,'' she said.
   Robert Herwick of Hambrecht & Quist in New York said the new
products give Apollo the strongest overall line since 1986, but it
may take time to convince customers.
   ``This is more than just another feeble attempt to catch up to
Sun,'' said Herwick. ``We've probably seen the worst of the pain
Apollo will go through because of a less-competitive product line.
There's likely to be some recovery now.''

<HEAD>Cooper Says Parties Are Interested in Purchase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Cooper Companies Inc., which has
been trying to sell all or part of its operations for more than a
year, said Monday it has received ``indications of interest'' from
parties in buying its principal businesses.
   Cooper, which is involved in optometric, ophthalmic surgical and
diagnostic businesses, said it is working with its investment
banker, Morgan Stanley & Co., to begin discussions and negotiations
with some of the newly interested parties.
   Gene Elsbree, a Cooper spokesman, wouldn't name the companies
interested in buying Cooper's businesses but said they include
American and foreign firms.
   Cooper said it hoped to be able to propose specific deals to its
board within 30 days.
   In trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, Cooper fell 50
cents a share to $11.12{.
   Cooper said it has enough cash flow to finance the company until
the sale of one of its principal businesses, but expects to
complete within the next few weeks the previously announced $40
million of ``bridge financing'' to help until the asset sales are
completed.
   The federal government last October blocked Ciba-Geigy's
proposed $150 million purchase of Cooper's worldwide contact lens
and solutions businesses. Cooper wound up selling Ciba-Geigy only
its international solutions business for $50 million.
   Earlier this year, the government blocked Schering-Plough Corp.,
parent of contact lens maker Wesley-Jessen, from buying Cooper's
worldwide lens business for $150 million. Schering-Plough also
agreed to buy both Cooper's worldwide contact and U.S. solutions
businesses for $195 million, but the government again blocked it on
antitrust grounds.
   On May 5, Cooper announced the Federal Trade Commission's
decision and announced the company would put all its assets up for
sale.
   In its second fiscal quarter ending April 30, Cooper had a net
loss of $12 million on sales of $232 million. For its fiscal year
ending Oct. 31, 1987, Cooper posted income of $52 million on sales
of $627 million.

<HEAD>Stocks Higher, Dollar Lower In Morning Tokyo Activity</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   The U.S. dollar declined against the Japanese in
Tuesday morning trading, while share prices edged higher on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar was changing hands at 132.88 yen by late morning,
down from Monday's close of 133.33 yen and from Tuesday's opening
level of 132.90 yen.
   Exchange dealers said market players were reluctant to
participate ahead of the release of Japanese trade figures for the
first half of this year, due out Tuesday afternoon in Tokyo, and
U.S. trade figures for May, to be announced Friday in Washington.
   On the stock exchange, the widely-followed Nikkei Stock Average
of 225 selected issues finished the morning session up 94.03 points
at 28.080.02 in moderate trading.
   Securities brokers attributed the gain to active buying by
institutional investors.
   ``Institutional investors sat back for the whole of last week
while the exchange rates were fluctuating,'' said Seiko Negishi, a
broker at Sanyo Securities. ``But they came back to the market this
week as they saw the yen-dollar rate settling around where it is
now.''
   Negishi also said institutional investors, who tend to be more
sensitive about the market situation abroad than do private
investors, reacted favorably to a decline in long-term interest
rates in Japan and the United States.
