   Two young men and two young women who
apparently were inhaling laughing gas to get high were found dead
Monday in a storeroom of a building housing a dental clinic,
authorities said.
   The bodies were found shortly before noon in a small room near
an empty tank of nitrous oxide, a gas used by dentists as an
anesthetic, Iron County prosecutor Scott Burns.
   ``It's believed that they were inhaling the gas,'' he said.
   Burns said there was no sign of forced entry.
   He identified the victims as Owen Marc Gregerson, 18, and Shawn
Williams, 19, both of Cedar City; Christine Cherie Miller, 20, of
Fillmore; and Margaret J. Probert, 20, of Scipio.
   The bodies were sent to the state medical examiner's office for
a determination of the cause of death, but Burns said preliminary
investigation shows they were asphyxiated.
   ``It's just a tragic accident and our hearts go out to the
families,'' he said. ``We've never had injuries or deaths due to
nitrous oxide. It's common throughout the United States for people
to try to gain access to that to try to get high.''

   Territorial conflicts that brought about the
war between Iran and Iraq eight years ago will jeopardize the truce
that both countries have accepted, an Iranian specialist in
international law said Monday.
   A 1975 border treaty could be the solution and for Iran there
``should be no questions,'' said Alireza Deyihim, deputy dean of
Iran's diplomatic academy that is affiliated with the Foreign
Ministry.
   He said in an interview that both countries had accepted the
1975 pact and Iraq ``clearly violated international law'' when it
abrogated the treaty unilaterally in 1979.
   Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after a series of border
skirmishes.
   Iran and Iraq agreed Monday to accept the United Nations's call
for a cease-fire. U.N. Security Council resolution 598 also states
that both Iraqi and Iranian forces should withdraw ``to the
internationally recognized borders without delay'' after the
cease-fire is in place.
   Deyihim said Iran believes that phrase means the forces should
withdraw to the borders agreed upon in the 1975 treaty between Iraq
and Iran's government of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi that was
overthrown in 1979 in the revolt led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   ``Both countries have ratified this treaty and announced
ratification to the United Nations,'' Deyihim said. ``That treaty
settled all problems including the border in the Shatt-al-Arab,''
the 120-mile waterway that flows into the Persian Gulf and forms
the southern border between the warring neighbors.
   Deyihim, who entered Iran's foreign service 17 years ago and was
involved in the 1975 treaty negotiations, said if Iraq had wanted
to renegotiate parts of the agreement it could have used the
complaints procedure that is part of the pact.
   He claimed Iraq had removed many of about 570 markers set to
delineate the 730-mile border after the 1975 treaty .
   ``They removed them ... and even pulled out trees'' that marked
the border, he said.
   ``We hope that this (border issue) does not cause a delay in
implementing the cease-fire.'' he added.

<TEXT>
   Japan's doors are hesitantly open to a trickle of
Americans seeking an experimental anti-AIDS drug that has not been
approved for use in the United States.
   The drug, dextran sulfate, was developed in Japan in the 1960s
and has been used to treat arteriosclerosis and high cholesterol.
   Within the last year, however, Japanese and American researchers
have shown in the test tube that the compound is a potent agent
against infection by HIV, which causes the fatal acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   Now researchers are trying to determine whether dextran sulfate
is effective when given to AIDS patients and whether they can take
large doses over a long period.
   The drug's potential has received wide publicity, and some
American AIDS sufferers or their friends have sought the drug in
Japan.
   ``A year ago I started receiving calls from American guys who
asked if dextran sulfate was available,'' said Manabu Yamamoto,
manager at the American Pharmacy in central Tokyo. ``I had no idea
it could be used against AIDS.''
   Now, Yamamoto says, two or three Americans come in every month
seeking dextran sulfate.
   The American Pharmacy is one of three pharmacies in the Tokyo
area that were authorized two months ago to sell the compound under
tight control _ but without a doctor's prescription _ by the
Phamarceutical Division of Kowa Co. Ltd., one of about a dozen
makers of dextran sulfate in Japan.
   ``We talked it over with the Ministry of Health, and decided for
humanitarian reasons it would be sold to American tourists,'' said
Kowa spokesman Kazuhiro Endo.
   Endo said the company limited over-the-counter sales to three
pharmacies because if dextran sulfate were widely available, it
would be difficult to give proper warnings to purchasers. ``There
could be damage, and we as a pharmaceutical company are quite
worried about this,'' he said.
   A buyer at the American Pharmacy must sign a form in English
stating how many tablets were purchased, that they were for
personal use, that the drug is approved in Japan for treatment of
high cholesterol at a dosage of 450-900 milligrams a day, and that
it affects blood coagulation and should not be used by hemophiliacs.
   A separate page includes information on adverse reactions, such
as skin eruptions, anorexia and diarrhea.
   The dosages being considered for AIDS therapy are much higher
than routine use in Japan. ``We don't have any information on this
drug in such high dosage,'' Endo said, adding that if a patient
takes a high dosage, ``the risks might be higher.''
   He declined to name all three pharmacies permitted to sell the
drug, though he said their names were well-known to San Francicso
AIDS sufferers. He said Kowa was concerned that people that people
with irrational fears of AIDS might experiment with dangerously
high doses.
   The three pharmacies reportedly have anywhere from two to 30
customers per month.
   The company also worries that buyers might start a black market
business exporting the drug, which sells at the American Pharmacy
for $272 for 1,000 300-milligram tablets.
   Kowa is not doing AIDS research with dextran sulfate. Japan's
leader in that area is a 70-year-old chemical firm, Ueno Fine
Chemicals, which has no medicines currently on the market.
   Ueno is worried that its research, backed in the United States
by the National Institute of Health, may be harmed by personal
imports by American AIDS sufferers.
   ``From a humane point of view, we will not do anything'' to stop
the drug's sale to Americans, said Dr. Ryuji Ueno, director of the
department of medicine at his family's company. ``We are just a
little disappointed, though.''
   At stake for the company is the possibility of a lucrative U.S.
market if the drug is proved effective.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently reaffirmed its
policy of letting AIDS patients import drugs for their personal use
even if they have not been approved.
   But the FDA last week ordered inspectors to block imports of
dextran sulfate from Polydex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. of Toronto,
Canada, saying the Canadian company was promoting its unproven drug
in violation of federal rules.
   The FDA has approved clinical tests of Ueno's dextran sulfate
compound but approval for use of the drug in AIDS therapy still is
a long way off, Ueno said in a telephone interview from his
laboratory near Osaka. So far, he said, the drug has been tested
for side effects on patients at San Francisco General Hospital.
   The current phase of tests, which began July 7, involves giving
patients increasingly higher doses to see whether the drug is
effective against HIV and to determine its side effects, Ueno said.
The research is being done at nine AIDS-treatment centers in the
United States and will take six months.
   Ueno said the FDA had granted his compound ``open drug status,''
meaning authorities will help fund research and give the drug a
protected market for seven years if it is successful.
   Japan has had only 80 AIDS cases, according to the Ministry of
Health and Welfare, so few that the drug could not be tested on
patients.
   AIDS is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Other
means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or
blood products, and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles
or syringes by drug abusers. AIDS can also be passed from mother to
child at or before birth.

   Rene Poirier, a Roman Catholic priest deported
from Haiti after he criticized the military government, said in an
interview Sunday he told his superiors last week that ``something
could happen to me.''
   ``I told them that if they heard I'd received a bullet in my
head, don't be surprised,'' Poirier said in the telephone interview.
   The priest, a native of Cornwall, Ont., arrived in Montreal
Saturday on a flight from New York.
   He was asked why be believed he could be the target of killers
and said ``the system is becoming much more repressive and anything
is possible.''
   Poirier said he was expelled because he spoke out against
injustice and encouraged the poor to organize politically. He
acknowledged he had refused a military demand to provide a list of
parish members who attended one of his recent religious services.
   He said the troopers who seized him Friday did not have a
warrant for his arrest and did not know his name.
   ``All they knew was that I was the (parish) priest and therefore
wicked,'' he said.
   Poirier gave this account of his expulsion:
   Several soldiers entered his parish in Grand Goave, 30 miles
southeast of the capital of Port-au-Prince, and drove him to a
prison where he was not allowed to call the Canadian Embassy.
   The soldiers took him to the airport where he was placed aboard
a commercial jetliner, and when he tried to resist they struck him
with their rifles and threw him face down on the aisle.
   It was a New York-bound flight and after spending the night in
New York he flew to Montreal.
   A Haitian radio station said the government accused Poirier of
making ``insulting public declarations which are liable to disturb
the social and political order established in the country.''
   A statement by the Canadian government said it was ``deeply
distressed and unhappy at the cavalier way that Father Poirier was
deported and (we) will be expressing our dissatisfaction to the
Haitian authorities.''
   Poirier was seized the same day that Haiti's leader, Lt. Gen.
Henri Namphy, was touring the Grand Goave region. Namphy said at
that time that Haiti's problems should be solved by Haitians, not
foreigners.
   Namphy, the armed forces commander, ousted civilian President
Leslie Manigat in June and sent him into exile. Namphy headed a
three-man junta that had ruled Haiti for two years after dictator
Jean-Claude Duvalier fled the country during violent protests in
February 1986. Duvalier now lives in France.

   Forest fires killed 69 people and injured 116 in
China during the first half of the year, but the deaths represented
a sharp drop from the same period a year ago, a newspaper reported
today.
   An official of the Central Forest Fire Prevention Headquarters
attributed the improved record to more rain in the north and
stepped-up efforts to upgrade the nation's fire-fighting
capabilities, the China Daily said.
   The number of deaths declined 48 percent over the same period
last year, the unidentified official was quoted as saying.
   The official said there were 9,700 forest fires during the first
half of the year, 33 percent fewer than for the same period of
1987; and that 120,694 acres of forest were burned through June,
down 85 percent, the paper reported.

   Elephants at the Beijing Zoo have forgotten the
taste of bananas and tigers are now rarely thrown a live chicken.
Hard times have befallen their keepers.
   The official China Daily said today that the 3,000 animals,
birds and fish at China's largest zoo have come across lean days
because of inadequate funding and sharp rises in food prices.
   With the quadrupling of banana prices in recent years, elephants
have been put on a diet of nutritious but less palatable carrots,
zoo officials said.
   Tigers now get just two meals a day, down from three, and are
fasting one day a week, zoo officials said, explaining that the big
cats are used to eating irregularly in the wild.
   In addition, tigers, lions and other carnivores that used to
have a twice-weekly treat of a live chicken or rabbit now feast on
such delicacies only when they are sick or weak.
   The report said the zoo had to give away its most popular seal
because it couldn't afford the annual expense of up to $13,500 in
fish.
   ``We don't want to adopt these cruel measures, but as our budget
is tightened, there seems to be no other way around,'' the report
quoted Jiang Hongtao, office director of the zoo, as saying.
   The daily said expenses at the zoo have shot up from $1.1
million in 1984 to $1.9 million last year.
   The state last year provided $810,000, and the zoo had to make
up the rest by introducing video games, bumper cars and other
sources of recreation. Admission to the zoo costs less than a
nickel.
   The zoo's chief accountant, Yang Qingchuan, said expenses may
double next year because of swiftly rising food costs.
   Consumer prices rose 19 percent in June compared to the same
month in 1987, while prices of some food items have nearly doubled
in the past year with the elimination of some government price
controls.
   The zoo opened in 1908 and is home to rare animals such as the
giant panda and the golden monkey. It is one of the capital's main
tourist attractions.

<HEAD>Poll: Equality Closer But Society Still Racist</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Americans believe the United States has moved
toward racial equality during the past quarter century, but a
majority say society remains racist overall, a Media
General-Associated Press poll has found.
   Twenty-five years after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. declared
his dream of equal opportunity, more than eight in 10 respondents
in the poll said the goal is closer and seven in 10 said it is
attainable.
   But while 54 percent said blacks and other minorities have the
same opportunities as whites in the United States, a sizable 42
percent of all respondents, including 69 percent of blacks,
disagreed.
   There were other measures of concern over inequality found by
the national survey of 1,223 adults. Among them:
   _Respondents were evenly divided on whether minorities receive
equal treatment in the nation's criminal justice system, and three
in 10 said minorities are denied justice because of their race.
   _Of those who said racial equality can be achieved, four in 10
said it would not occur within their lifetimes.
   _Majorities in all education, income and ideological groups, and
all but the oldest age group, said American society is racist
overall. Fifty-three percent of whites agreed, as did 68 percent of
blacks. In all, 55 percent said society is racist, 37 percent said
not and the rest had no opinion.
   It was a quarter century ago, in August 1963, that King
delivered his celebrated ``I have a dream'' speech to 200,000
demonstrators in Washington, establishing civil rights at the
forefront of the nation's social agenda.
   ``I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia sons
of former slaves and sons of former slave owners will be able to
sit down together at the table of brotherhood,'' King said. ``I
have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a
nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin,
but by the content of their character.''
   The Civil Rights Act became law a year later, prompting sweeping
changes in the then-segregated South. But many Americans in the
poll, particularly the better-educated, indicated that the advances
are not complete.
   Among respondents with postgraduate degrees, only 28 percent
said blacks and other minorities have the same opportunities as
whites now. By contrast, 65 percent of those with only high school
diplomas said there is equality.
   On the question of the criminal justice system, 46 percent of
whites said minorities received equal treatment, but 40 percent
said not, and nearly 15 percent didn't know. Sixty-one percent of
blacks said minorities did not receive equal treatment in the
criminal justice system.
   Even with the perceptions of inequality, the poll found divided
opinion among blacks and solid opposition among whites to the
practice of giving minorities preference in hiring and college
admissions to address past inequalities.
   Forty-eight percent of blacks were in favor and 44 percent were
opposed to preferential treatment in hiring, and they split 44-47
on preference in college admissions. More than 80 percent of whites
opposed both.
   Despite their sense of racism and discrimination in society, 94
percent of the blacks said they had close friends who are white. A
smaller share of whites, 67 percent, said they had close friends
who are black.
   The Media General-AP poll consisted of telephone interviews June
22-July 2 with a randomly selected sample of adults across the
nation, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.
   Media General Inc., a communications company based in Richmond,
Va., publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News

   The Media General-Associated Press poll on civil
rights was based on telephone interviews June 22-July 2 with 1,223
adults in the continental United States.
   Phone numbers were selected randomly by computer and interviews
were conducted with the adult at each household who had the most
recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that if
every adult American were asked the same questions, the results
theoretically would be within 3 points of the poll's results, 19
times out of 20. The error margin is larger for subgroups _ 9
points, for example, for blacks, who made up 11 percent of the
adjusted sample, their share of the adult population.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and
responses in this poll; because of rounding, some totals may exceed
100:
   1. Overall, do you think blacks and other minorities have the
same opportunities as whites in the United States, or not?
   Yes: 54 percent. No: 42 percent. Don't know or no answer: 4
percent.
   2. In the past 25 years, do you think the country has moved
closer to equal opportunity among the races, or farther away from
it, or has there been no movement?
   Closer: 84 percent. Farther: 5 percent. No movement: 7 percent.
DK-NA: 4 percent.
   3. Do you think it is possible to achieve equal opportunity
among the races in the United States, or not?
   Yes: 71 percent. No: 24 percent. DK-NA: 5 percent.
   3a. If yes: Do you think it will happen in your lifetime, or not?
   Yes: 53 percent. No: 40 percent. DK-NA: 7 percent.
   4. Do you think blacks and other minorities should receive
preference in hiring to make up for past inequalities, or not?
   Yes: 15 percent. No: 79 percent. DK-NA: 6 percent.
   5. Do you think blacks and other minorities should receive
preference in college admissions to make up for past inequalities,
or not?
   Yes: 18 percent. No: 76 percent. DK-NA: 5 percent.
   6. Do you think blacks and other minorities receive equal
treatment as whites in the criminal justice system, or not?
   Yes: 43 percent. No: 43 percent. DK-NA: 15 percent.
   6a. If no: Do you think blacks and other minorities are denied
justice because of their race, or not?
   Yes: 69 percent. No: 24 percent. DK-NA: 7 percent.
   7. Do you think Jesse Jackson's campaign for the Democratic
presidential nomination advanced the cause of civil rights, set
back the cause of civil rights, or had no effect on it?
   Advanced: 51 percent. Set back: 7 percent. No effect: 33
percent. DK-NA: 9 percent.
   8. Do you have any close friends who are black, or not?
   Among whites: Yes: 67 percent. No: 31 percent. DK-NA: 2 percent.
   9. Do you have any close friends who are white, or not?
   Among blacks Yes: 94 percent. No: 5 percent. DK-NA: 2 percent.
   10. Do you think American society overall is racist, or not?
   Yes: 55 percent. No: 37 percent. DK-NA: 9 percent.

<TEXT>
   More than 50 cars of a freight train
derailed Monday, causing tankers to break open and spill a
flammable industrial solvent, and forcing the evacuation of about
300 people overnight, authorities said.
   Authorities built a dike, using booms supplied by the U.S. Coast
Guard, to keep the pool of liquid xylene from flowing into nearby
Beaver Dam Creek, said Lucy Justus, spokeswoman for the state
Environmental Protection Division.
   The Elbert County sheriff's department and officials with CSX
Transportation Inc. estimated 57 cars in the 95-car CSX train
derailed about 1:30 p.m. in this rural community.
   Elbert Memorial Hospital reported treating about 20 people who
had breathed fumes from the liquid chemical, which is used in
aviation fuel and as a solvent for resins, enamels and lacquers.
   None were seriously injured and all were released after ``they
were washed down and looked at by a physician,'' said Tom Johnson,
a hospital official.
   ``The primary hazard is that it (xylene) is flammable. There are
vapors and fumes which are mildly toxic by inhalation or
ingestion,'' Ms. Justus said.
   The fractured tanker, which contained about 30,000 gallons of
xylene, leaked its contents at a rate that grew to 3,000 gallons an
hour, she said. A second tanker also was leaking the chemical,
although at a much slower rate, she said. Five of the derailed cars
contained xylene, she said.
   CSX Transportation spokesman Ripley Watson said the train, which
was headed to Hamlet, N.C., from Atlanta, also carried coal, pulp
board, lumber, soybean meal and a number of piggybacked truck
trailers.
   He said the train was going about 35 mph when it derailed. There
was no immediate indication of what caused the derailment.
   Cleanup was expected to begin after daylight Tuesday. Ms. Justus
said the liquid probably would be allowed to soak into the dirt
field where it spilled and the contaminated soil would be dug up
and taken to a hazardous waste landfill.
   The Elberton Civic Center was set up as a clearing house for aid
to the evacuees. Most found shelter at motels or at the homes of
family and friends in the area, although the Rev. Gary Purvis,
pastor of First Baptist Church of Elberton, said he expected some
evacuees would sleep on the pews at his church.
   Middleton is four miles northeast of Elberton, in eastern
Georgia about midway between Atlanta and Columbia, S.C.

   Actor Martin Landau is savoring his part in the
new movie ``Tucker: The Man and His Dream,'' saying it is one of
the best roles he's had in 25 years.
   ``This role allowed me to act. I loved it,'' Landau said in an
interview published Sunday in The New York Times.
   Landau, perhaps best known as master illusionist Rolin' Hand in
television's ``Mission: Impossible,'' plays Abe Karatz in Francis
Ford Coppola's film, which opens this week.
   His character is an amiable businessman-hustler who advises
Preston Tucker, an industrialist who tried to break into the
automobile industry following World War II.
   Their friendship forms a subplot of the movie. ``I think of it
as a love story,'' Landau said, ``a very healthy love story between
two men.''
   ``In size and dimension, it's probably the best role I've had
since `Cleopatra,''' Landau said, referring to the 1963 movie.

   Gary Coleman, who became a star as the tiny
hero of NBC's ``Diff'rent Strokes,'' says he blames his parents for
his lack of maturity and a resulting reputation as a difficult,
spoiled child star.
   ``I have a lot of trouble with industry people that respect my
work, respect my craft, but don't respect me because I have that
shadowy reputation,'' Coleman told Bob Costas on the forthcoming
NBC talk show ``Later with Bob Costas.''
   The 20-year-old actor is only 4-foot-8 because of drugs he takes
to keep his body from rejecting two kidney transplants.
   In the three years since ``Diff'rent Strokes'' went off the air,
Coleman has had just two acting jobs.
   ``I just hope people understand that if I'm crazy or if I'm rude
or if I have a bad reputation, it's 10 percent my fault and 90
percent of those that were supposed to have been helping me and
caring for me,'' he said.
   He said he has little contact with his parents, calling them on
the phone ``once in a blue moon.''
   The Costas show is slated to debut later this month.

   Soviet defector Natalia Makarova says that
although she hasn't danced with Leningrad's Kirov Ballet for 18
years, she's always had a ``spiritual contact'' with the troupe.
   Miss Makarova, 47, rejoined her former company Saturday during
its London visit to dance one performance of the pas de deux from
Act II of ``Swan Lake,'' after getting special permission from
Moscow.
   As she took her bow, many in the audience stood, clapping and
shouting, ``Bravo!''
   Miss Makarova defected in 1970 during the Kirov's last visit to
London, saying she wanted greater artistic freedom and opportunity.
   She said in an interview before Saturday's performance that she
would have liked to rejoin the Kirov, if she were younger.
   ``One company has been in my heart all these years, and I never
lose spiritual contact with them. It is the most happy moment in my
life,'' she said. ``It fulfills my own soul.''

   Pro basketball player Sidney Moncrief
told youngsters in a summer reading program that if he'd paid more
attention to reading himself that day, he wouldn't have had a
weekend encounter with the law.
   Moncrief said he wished he'd read his speedometer while driving
to speak to the program Saturday.
   ``If I had read my speed, I wouldn't have been stopped by a
state trooper'' while en route to the ceremony for about 150
participants in the Central Arkansas Library System's Summer
Reading Program.
   Moncrief, who plays for the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks, has an

elaborate on the traffic stop. An Arkansas State Police dispatcher
said he had no information about it.

   Although Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton had a full
agenda at the National Governors Association meeting, one of his
main objectives was living down the long speech he made at the
Democratic National Convention.
   Clinton said he received a request to speak at the governors'
meeting from its incoming chairman and fellow Democrat, Virginia
Gov. Gerald Baliles.
   ``Governor Baliles just suggested that I begin my remarks with
the words, `in conclusion,''' Clinton said Sunday, drawing applause
from those gathered to hear a debate on education issues.
   Those two words drew a roar of applause when Clinton wrapped up
his speech in Atlanta to nominate Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis for president.
   Clinton was allotted 15 minutes for the nationally-televised
speech but spoke for more than twice that. The speech was panned as
boring and too long. Clinton admitted as much later.

   Congressman Floyd Spence is planning a
homecoming to South Carolina for the first time since his
double-lung transplant and his marriage to a woman 23 years his
junior.
   The 60-year-old Republican congressman who's running for
re-election in South Carolina this fall says he's grateful to be
alive. On May 6, his lungs, devastated by years of emphysema, were
replaced with a pair from an 18-year-old youth killed in a
motorcycle accident in Texas.
   And on July 3, he married Debbie Williams, a woman he had been
courting 8{ years.
   Spence said in an interview with The (Columbia, S.C.) State
newspaper from Jackson, Miss., that his illness has cost him votes
because of questions about his ability to represent the district.
   But Spence says he's recovering well and is able to exercise 90
minutes a day. His convalescence was highlighted by a get-well note
from former White House aide Oliver North and a telephone call from
singer Barbara Mandrell, he said.
   Spence and his bride are scheduled to arrive in Columbia
tonight. He plans to attend a fund-raiser for his campaign on
Tuesday.

   Parishioners at St. Mark's United Methodist
Church can simply say, ``Charge it,'' the next time the collection
plate comes their way.
   Officers of the church's finance committee decided to accept
donations via MasterCard and Visa, beginning Sunday.
   ``A lot of people may look at it with distaste, but they don't
have to utilize it,'' said Ron Ecklund, chairman of the church
finance committee. ``Some people have requested it and we're a
large enough church that we can accommodate them. I think
convenience is the number one advantage.''
   Any of the 3,000 parishioners who make credit-card donations
will get a receipt they can put in an envelope and drop in the
collection plate.
   ``People still feel good about putting something in the
collection plate,'' Ecklund said. ``I always feel awkward sitting
in the pew and not putting anything in the collection plate when it
is passed.''
   Congregation members also can arrange to have a certain amount
automatically charged to their bank account on a specified day of
the month.

   The couple met a year ago, and Boatwright proposed after the Air

   They decided to get married by telephone because Boatwright

said the bride, who hopes to join her husband within six weeks.
   About 30 people gathered at the bride's home for the ceremony,

   When Caterpillar Inc. struts its stuff, it
does it in a big way.
   The company staged a ``power parade'' Sunday, displaying $15
million worth of its finest earth-moving equipment in a showcase of
sophisticated engineering and raw power for 10,000 customers and
employees.
   The Peoria-based Caterpillar trotted out 76 machines _ from the
largest track-type tractor in production on any assembly line, down
to its smallest paving vehicle.
   The demonstration track built near Peoria for the parade looked
like a giant construction site. Scrapers used in highway
construction pulled up dirt and dumped it back. Excavators dug
holes, filled their buckets with dirt and then loaded empty dump
trucks used in mining and construction.
   Graders leveled the rumpled ground and compactors rumbled along,
packing the dirt down again.
   There were tests of strength for hydraulic-powered swing arms.
Other machines did push-ups, intricate driving and even waved to
the crowd in unison.
   But the crowd's favorite was a wheel loader that used one tooth
on its massive front bucket to gently crack an egg.

   Former NBC reporter Linda Ellerbee said she
was afraid that colleague Jessica Savitch was on a suicidal course
because of problems including drug use but her approaches to
network management went unheeded.
   Savitch was killed in a car accident Oct. 26, 1983, in New Hope,
Pa. The accident was not linked to drug use.
   Recent books about Savitch describe her as a tormented women who
was well aware that she had moved up the ladder on her appealing
presence and was resented by more experienced colleagues.
   Her career nose-dived after a disastrous newsbrief in which she
appeared on the air virtually incoherent.
   ``At one point,'' Ellerbee said, ``I went to NBC management and
said, `You have to do something. This woman's in trouble.' An NBC
vice president said to me, `We're afraid to do anything. We're
afraid she'll kill herself on our time.''
   Ellerbee says on the first installment of the new late-night
talk show ``Later with Bob Costas,'' to be broadcast Aug. 22, that
she and her NBC correspondents decided to try to help Savitch.
   Ellerbee said she, former NBC correspondent John Hart and other
NBC News colleagues met in Ellerbee's office and decided Hart would
get advice from his psychiatrist on how to approach Savitch. But
she died in the car wreck that weekend.
   Savitch's story is worth telling, Ellerbee said, ``as a
cautionary tale'' for young women and men entering the television
news field.
   Ellerbee, who now free-lances her commentary and hopes to have a
PBS version of ABC's ``Our World,'' says television news has
changed little in its attitude toward women who go into the
business.
   ``Jessica is just what the business wanted,'' she said. ``Let's
be candid _ what the men who run the business wanted. She looked
the part, and they didn't care that she wasn't a very good reporter
and that she wasn't a very good writer.
   ``They just wanted what they wanted out of her, and it's a
tragedy that they didn't want more. Jessica might have been able to
give more had they expected more from the very beginning.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Reagan is Bush Surrogate with Conservatives</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A surrogate campaigner for George Bush has
been trying to reassure the political right that the vice president
isn't straying too far from conservative doctrine as he moves
toward the center in his presidential campaign.
   The surrogate's name is Ronald Reagan.
   Increasingly the president sprinkles his speeches with such
phrases as ``Vice President Bush and I'' and ``Nancy, Vice
President Bush and me.''
   He also has both praised and glossed over positions that Bush
has taken that are at variance with his own conservative stands.
   In a recent speech to a group of evangelical youth, for example,
he tackled the issue of day care for children. Reagan has opposed
government-subsidized child care proposals.
   Bush, however, trails in the polls among women voters and has
attempted to close that ``gender gap'' with proposals including a
$2.2 billion plan to give low-income families a $1,000-per-child
tax credit for day care.
   Conservatives have generally been against this kind of thing,
and it is one of a number of issues on which Bush has been
exploring new territory in a campaign that is expected to be fought
out in the political center.
   Reagan, speaking to the Student Congress on Evangelism,
approached the matter this way:
   ``Vice President Bush has proposed an innovative plan, one that
would strengthen the family. ... The basic idea here is that the
government would simply let families keep up to $1,000 more of
their own money. That's money the family itself can decide how to
spend. Working mothers could put the money toward child care. But
by giving each family this tax credit the vice president's plan
would also permit thousands of mothers to choose to stay home with
their children.''
   Reagan suggests that even though it goes against the grain of
traditional conservative thought, Bush's day-care program is really
pro-family and amounts to a kind of tax cut _ things that
conservatives like.
   The president also tiptoed around the differences between his
position and the vice president's on abortion.
   Bush has said he would accept abortion if necessary to save the
life of the mother or in instances of rape and incest. The
president has said repeatedly he would accept the operation only if
needed to save the mother's life.
   The way Reagan spelled it out to the evangelicals was:
   ``Many who seek abortions do so in harrowing circumstances. And
just as tolerance means accepting that many in good faith hold
views different from our own, it also means that no man or woman
should sit in judgment on another. I believe _ and Vice President
Bush believes with me _ that we must rise above bitterness and
reproach to find positive answers to the tragedy of abortion.''
   No mention of their differences _ just ``positive answers'' for
people in ``harrowing circumstances.''
   As the campaign goes on, Bush is expected to stake out
increasingly independent stands.
   ``He's talking about education, he's talking about child care,
soon he is going to be talking about flexibility in defense
posture, he's talking about public service,'' said Stephen J.
Wayne, a specialist in the presidency and electoral politics at
George Washington University.
   Not the usual fare for conservative rallies.
   So are Reagan's explanations part of a plan to bolster Bush's
conservative credentials?
   ``I don't know if it has been strategically laid out as such,
but it makes sense,'' said Daniel L. Casey, executive director of
the American Conservative Union. ``That is probably the single best
way to use him.''

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis' challenge to debate George Bush
on foreign policy and defense is the Democratic presidential
nominee's confident counterattack in an area that could be either a
weakness or a weapon for him.
   Dukakis' staff seemed taken aback by Bush's claim last week that
Dukakis would unilaterally disarm the nation, an unusually
aggressive attack at this early stage of the general election
campaign.
   ``Shrill'' was the way Dukakis described it as he delivered a
series of escalating responses ending in the call for a
mid-September debate on the issue.
   It had already been clear, however, that Bush would strive to
paint Dukakis as inexperienced and out of step on national security
matters as the vice president moved to recover from a substantial
deficit in the polls.
   Foreign policy, defense and national security concerns are
widely regarded as the weakest areas for Dukakis for a variety of
reasons. It is the one area in which Dukakis, a statehouse
politician, has no record. And despite his familiarity with several
languages, Dukakis is not a veteran traveler to foreign capitals.
   Bush, for all his image problems, can point to his experience in
the international arena even before his vice presidency as
ambassador to China and CIA director.
   But Dukakis has been hammering away at Bush on the foreign
affairs missteps of the Reagan administration. The Dukakis campaign
clearly believes that Bush is vulnerable on the Iran-Contra affair,
dealings with Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega, the Pentagon
contracting scandal and other problems.
   Dukakis raised that criticism to a new level on Friday while
campaigning in California when he said Bush doesn't ``have what it
takes'' to run the country.
   ``Anybody who sits there and does nothing while we trade arms to
the Ayatollah, and says he didn't know that Noriega was doing drugs
and running drugs (and) is a suspected murderer, and went to the
Philippines in the early '80s and commended (Ferdinand) Marcos for
his commitment to democracy, in my judgment doesn't have what it
takes to lead this country when it comes to foreign policy,''
Dukakis said.
   A day earlier, however, Dukakis had fed the impression he could
misstep on military issues when he was questioned about Bush's
charges. Asked initially if he still supported a nuclear freeze,
which was debated before arms reduction talks began in 1985,
Dukakis responded ``sure.''
   Moments later aboard his campaign jet, Dukakis aides hastily
arranged a news conference and brought the candidate back to where
reporters were sitting on the plane. There, when asked, he
clarified his response and said that the issue had moved beyond the
question of a nuclear freeze to that of arms reductions.
   ``The reason we were all for the freeze originally was because
we wanted to stop the administration from expanding the arsenal,''
Dukakis said. He said that had changed now that negotiations
centered on reductions.
   ``Did I favor the freeze? Sure. I'm for reductions now. So's the
administration,'' he said. ``I'm for developing certain weapons
systems (and) for substantially reducing others.''
   In attacking the Democratic nominee, Bush pointed to Dukakis'
opposition to some new systems, particularly land-based nuclear
weapons. Dukakis has said he doesn't rule out modernization of the
land-based arsenal _ that is, producing a new type of missile. Yet
he opposes current options _ the MX and the smaller Midgetman.
   Dukakis aides point to his support for other systems, such as
the new Trident submarine-based missile and cruise missiles, and
for development of the bomb-carrying Stealth aircraft.
   Dukakis generally prefers to talk about his plans to beef up
conventional forces, although he has not been specific on how to
pay for expensive upgrades in equipment, weaponry, supplies and
training. It is on conventional forces that he can be expected to
focus if he gets that debate with Bush.

   The owners of 1988 passenger vans and large
sedans are likely to have fewer damage claims and lower repair
bills, while those who own sports cars and some compact cars may
not be as lucky, according to an insurance industry report.
   The study by the Highway Loss Data Institute, an insurance
research group, examined both the frequency of insurance collision
claims and the average amount of the claim for 60 new cars that had
repairs paid through insurance policies during the first nine
months of the 1988 model year.
   ``Even among cars of the same size class and body style there
were large variations in results,'' the insurance group said. But
it said that in general, larger cars had a better collision loss
record than smaller vehicles.
   The average claim payment ranged from $800 to $3,500, depending
on the type of vehicle. The frequency of claims ranged from six to
nearly 17 per 100 vehicles, the study said.
   The study did not provide dollar amounts for all vehicle claims,
but said the average repair bill for the 60 cars was $1,921. The
average number of claims filed was 11.1 per 100 insured vehicles.
   It singled out the Chevrolet Astro van as having the lowest
average loss payment per claim, 60 percent lower than average for
all passenger vehicles examined. The Jaguar XJ6 had the highest, 83
percent higher than average for all cars, while the Mazda MX-6 and
the Ford Mustang also had average repair costs per claim that were
at least 50 percent higher than average.
   The study said the passenger vehicles with ``substantially
better than average'' results in both frequency of claims and
average cost of repairs also were vans _ the Plymouth Grand Voyager
and Dodge Caravan _ and two large, 4-door sedans _ the Chevrolet
Caprice and the Mercury Grand Marquis.
   All four of these vehicles had claim frequencies and loss
payments at least 30 percent below the average for all cars.
   The least number of claims per vehicles on the road involved the
4-door Cadillac DeVille which had 46 percent fewer claims than
average for all cars.
   At the other extreme, the cars with the poorest showing in both
claim frequencies and repair costs were the Ford Mustang and
Chevrolet Camaro, both in the ``sports-speciality'' category, and
the 2-door Mazda MX-6 in the small car category.
   All three had claim frequencies and loss payments more than 20
percent above average. The Mustang had more than twice the average
repair cost than reported for all cars _ the highest among the 60
cars _ and 32 percent more claims.
   The 2-door Toyota Celica had the most number of claims, 53
percent more than the average for all cars.
   While both the number of claims and the average cost of repairs
ranged widely among vehicles of different size and design, the
insurance group said they also varied significantly within groups
of basically similar cars.
   For example, the frequency of claims among the ``small'' cars
ranged from 12 percent below average for the Mercury Tracer to 53
percent above average for the Toyota Celica and 46 percent above
average for the Pontiac LeMans.
   In the mid-size category, the frequency of claims ranged from 32
percent below average for the Chevrolet Celebrity to 29 percent
above average for the Renault Medallion. Repair costs ranged from
21 percent below average per claim for the Celebrity to 25 percent
above average for the Chevrolet Cavalier.
   The study examined 60 model 1988 passenger vehicles that had
collision claims filed from June 1987 through February 1988. While
there are about 400 various 1988 car types, only 60 had sufficient
highway exposure during the period to be included in the study, the
institute said.

   Here are the relative frequency of claims and
repair cost comparisions of 1988 model cars examined by the
insurance industry, according to the Highway Loss Data Institute.
   The number in each column reflects relative claim frequencies or
repair costs compared to the average (reflected by the figure 100)
for all cars examined. For claim frequency, 100 is equivalent to
11.1 claims per 100 insured vehicles; for average loss payment per
claim, 100 is equivalent to $1,921.
   (Example: a claim frequency 123 would reflect 23 percent more
claims than average for all vehicles listed. A claim frequency of
88 would reflect 12 percent fewer claims than average for all
vehicles listed. A repair cost figure of 82 reflects a cost 18
percent lower than average, while a repair cost figure of 166
reflects a cost 66 percent higher than average.)

<HEAD>US Officials Keeping Eye on Falling Soviet Satellite</HEAD>

   Federal officials have begun contingency
planning in case an out-of-control Russian satellite powered by a
nuclear reactor plunges to earth inside the United States.
   At the moment, ``we don't anticipate at all that it will land on
the United States,'' says Peg Malloy, a spokeswoman for the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. ``But we need to have our act together
to respond to any catastrophic emergency, so we're coordinating an
inter-agency effort right now.''
   The planning work has drawn together representatives from the
Departments of Defense, State, Health and Human Services and Energy
in addition to the Environmental Protection Agency, the spokeswoman
added.
   The various agencies are working to tailor FEMA's general
``Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan'' to deal with the
possibility of radioactive satellite pieces being spread across the
countryside, Ms. Malloy said.
   The agency's radiological emergency plan was originally
developed in the wake of the Three-Mile Island nuclear plant
disaster, she added.
   The concern of the planners is a nuclear-powered,
ocean-surveillance satellite launched by the Soviet Union last
December 12 to keep track of U.S. Navy vessels. The satellite,
designated by the Soviets as Cosmos 1900, began its life in space
in a low circular orbit about 160 miles above the earth's surface.
   Soviet controllers unexpectedly lost radio contact with the
craft in April and the Russian news agency Tass reported May 11
that the satellite could fall to Earth in August or September.
   Soviet officials have insisted there is no reason to fear
radioactive debris from the spacecraft's re-entry. But according to
Pentagon officials, the Soviets have apparently been unable to
separate either the nuclear reactor or the fuel section from the
rest of the satellite _ two common safeguards.
   That raises the possibility Cosmos 1900 could re-enter the
atmosphere in one piece, meaning it might not burn up completely.
That could spread harmful radioactive debris, just as Cosmos 954
did over Canada in 1978.
   ``At the moment, it's still a one-piece satellite,'' Navy Cmdr.
Dugald Gillies, a spokesman for the U.S. Space Command, said
recently.
   The orbit of Cosmos 1900 is continuing to decay and the
spacecraft is now under constant surveillance, Gillies said.
   ``Re-entry is not imminent,'' he said. ``But the period for a
revolution is continuing to decline and it's continuing to come in
closer to Earth. We're keeping a close watch on it.''
   While the U.S. Space Command is not yet prepared to predict when
the Russian satellite will re-enter the atmosphere, the European
Space Agency in Paris said last week it thought the plunge would
occur in mid-September.
   ``Cosmos 1900 is expected to re-enter around the middle of
September, give or take four weeks,'' the agency said in a
statement. ``Only a few days before the satellite re-enters can the
entry location be predicted.
   ``Until then, experts can only say that Cosmos 1900 will
re-enter somewhere between latitudes 65 degrees north and 65
degrees south'' _ meaning anywhere in the world between the Arctic
and Antarctic Circles.
   ``It's not coming down as fast as originally anticipated, but
it's coming down,'' added Ms. Malloy.
   Should Cosmos 1900 fall within U.S. borders, FEMA will have an
emergency response team ready, she said.
   The size and composition of the response team will depend upon a
variety of factors, including whether the satellite debris is
radioactive and where it lands, she said.
   The Soviet Union has launched more than 30 nuclear-powered
satellites over the years and in at least two cases, radioactive
debris from such satellites has fallen to the Earth's surface.
Besides the crash of Cosmos 954 over Canada in 1978, the nuclear
core of Cosmos 1402 splashed into the Indian Ocean in 1983.

<HEAD>Murdoch Agrees To Pay $3 Billion For Annenberg's Triangle
Publications</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rupert Murdoch has agreed to buy Triangle
Publications Inc. for $3 billion in one of the most expensive media
deals ever and one that would add TV Guide, the nation's
largest-selling weekly magazine, to his empire.
   The purchase of the privately-held company from Walter Annenberg
includes two other publications: the Daily Racing Form and
Seventeen magazine, Murdoch said Sunday.
   ``These publications are the most valuable and prized publishing
properties in the world,'' Murdoch said in a statement announcing
the purchase by his News Corp.
   The purchase of TV Guide raises anti-trust questions because of
Murdoch's ownership of the Fox Television Network, said Andrew J.
Schwartzman, executive director of the Media Access Project, a
Washington, D.C.-based public interest telecommunications firm.
   But a spokesman for Murdoch said TV Guide would be run
separately from Murdoch's other holdings, which include newspapers
and magazines on four continents.
   Murdoch began negotiating with the 80-year-old Annenberg for
Triangle a month ago.
   ``They (the Triangle publications) have been developed
brilliantly by Ambassador Annenberg and we plan to make them the
cornerstone of a great American publishing company,'' Murdoch said.
   Annenberg, chairman of Triangle, said in a statement: ``I am
very happy that my publications are passing to Mr. Murdoch's
company. I now plan to devote the rest of my life to education and
philanthropy.''
   His past philanthropies include the establishment of the
Annenberg School of Communications at the University of
Pennsylvania, to which he has given one-third of Triangle's stock
over the years.
   Murdoch and Annenberg were in Los Angeles and would have no
further comment, said Murdoch spokesman Howard Rubenstein. The
spokesman declined to say who initiated the talks for the sale,
which is contingent upon signing of a final contract.
   The largest media takeover was Capital Cities Inc.'s $3.5
billion purchase of ABC in 1986.
   Annenberg, who was U.S. ambassador to the Court of St. James in
London during the Nixon administration, took over Triangle from his
father in the 1930s. He founded TV Guide in 1952 and it quickly
became Triangle's flagship, earning an estimated $75 million per
year.
   TV Guide has an audited circulation of more than 17 million
copies.
   Triangle was valued at about $1 billion last year by Wall Street
analysts.
   ``The three best businesses in America are the Daily Racing
Form, TV Guide and the Wall Street Journal,'' Annenberg said in a
1987 interview, when he indicated that the three publications would
be sold before 1990.
   Schwartzman said joint ownership of TV Guide and the Fox network
could allow Murdoch to use the publication to favor Fox programs
and stations. Such treatment could hurt small independent TV
stations, for which TV Guide is an essential advertising medium,
said Schwartzman.
   ``Any media conglomeration of this scope ought to set off
warning signals at the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice
Department,'' Schwartzman said.
   But Rubinstein said, ``The TV Guide will be run totally
independent of all Mr. Murdoch's other interests.''
   Murdoch, 58, is perhaps best known in America for his work at
the New York Post, which he purchased in 1976 and converted from
one of the country's most liberal dailies to a conservative paper
with screaming headlines.
   He sold the Post earlier this year to conform with federal
regulations barring dual ownership of a television station and a
newspaper in the same city. His holdings have an estimated value of
$2.2 billion.

<HEAD>GOP Delegates Aren't Choosy on Vice President Selection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delegates to the Republican National
Convention aren't particularly choosy about a vice presidential
candidate, with the largest group inclined to accept anyone George
Bush selects.
   In an Associated Press survey, the ``candidate'' backed by the
largest group of delegates, 39 percent, was nobody in particular.
   Two former presidential candidates, Jack Kemp and Bob Dole, each
were favored by 14 percent.
   Others mentioned by a smattering of delegates included Chrysler
Corp. Chairman Lee A. Iacocca, major league baseball Commissioner
Peter Ueberroth, former White House communications director Patrick
Buchanan and a couple of otherwise unknowns whose candidacies were
advanced by relatives who happen to be delegates.
   Of the 1,274 GOP delegates responding to the AP survey, 492 said
they had no particular choice for the No. 2 spot on the party's
ticket.
   That sentiment is not at all uncommon as delegates tend to defer
to whatever decision their party's presidential nominee makes on
the issue of a running mate.
   Two-thirds of the Democratic delegates did not name anyone as
their choice for vice president, but when Michael Dukakis picked
Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as his running mate, that decision was
endorsed by acclamation at last month's convention in Atlanta.
   Bush has said he will not announce his running mate until Aug.
18, the final day of the Republican convention.
   The AP survey did show some sentiment for a female vice
presidential candidate. Polls have shown that Bush lags behind
Dukakis among female voters, and 10 percent of the delegates
responding to the AP survey said one way to overcome this would be
to pick a woman as his running mate.
   Fourteen percent of the GOP delegates scattered their support
among four women: former United Nations Ambassador Jeane
Kirkpatrick, who was named by 82 delegates, former Transportation
Secretary Elizabeth Dole, supported by 79 delegates, Sen. Nancy
Kassebaum of Kansas with 17 delegates and Supreme Court Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor with five delegates.
   Kassebaum has said she does not want to be considered for the
vice presidential spot, as has California Gov. George Deukmejian,
who was named as the choice of two dozen delegates.
   The delegates' vice presidential choices cut across lines of
education, gender and political experience, with roughly the same
percentages of college graduates supporting Dole as Kemp, for
example.
   The survey was conducted by AP bureaus in all 50 states, as well
as Puerto Rico and is based on responses from 56 percent of the
2,277 delegates who will attend the GOP convention.

   Charles Haid, who portrayed Officer Andy
Renko on television's old ``Hill Street Blues'' and stars in the
movie ``The Rescue,'' was plucked from the ocean after he took a
spill off his sail boat.
   Haid, 40, said he was never in danger after falling from the
catamaran about a mile off Broad Beach on Saturday afternoon. He
said a couple pulled him from the water 45 minutes later.
   Haid said he fell into the water while trying to attach himself
to a harness that allows him to lean out over the water as the
wind-tipped boat rides on one pontoon.
   ``I was hooking on, my hook slipped and I went off the back,''
Haid said after the accident.
   His brother, who also was on the boat, lost sight of him, and
went back to shore for help.
   The actor, who was wearing a wet suit and a life preserver, said
he ``would have just floated ashore'' if the unidentified couple
hadn't come along.

<HEAD>U.S. District Judge J. Skelly Wright Noted For Desegregation
Rulings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   J. Skelly Wright, whose 38-year career as a
federal judge included decisions on major cases balancing
individual rights and government power, has died at age 77.
   Wright, who participated in the Pentagon Papers case and wrote
the decree ending de facto segregation in the nation's capital,
died Saturday of cancer.
   He had retired last year after 25 years on the U.S. Court of
Appeals here _ two as chief judge _ and 13 years as a U.S. District
judge in his native New Orleans.
   Wright, whose full name was James Skelly Wright, graduated from
Loyola University Law School in 1934 and became an assistant U.S.
attorney three years later. Following military duty in London,
Wright returned to New Orleans to practice law before being named
U.S. attorney in 1948.
   The next year, at the age of 38, he was appointed to the U.S.
District Court, becoming the youngest man to hold the post at that
time.
   After his 1960 order desegregating the New Orleans school system
drew threats against his life, President Kennedy reassigned Wright
to Washington, D.C.
   In 1967, Wright's order overturned the District school system's
racially separate ``tracking system'' for grouping students. The
``Wright decree,'' in addressing de facto segregation, was
considered one of the most significant education rulings since the
1954 Supreme Court decision outlawing the doctrine of ``separate
but equal'' schools.
   In the 1971 Pentagon Papers case involving an attempt by the
government on national security grounds to restrain publication of
military documents by The Washington Post, he dissented from the
ruling of two other judges on a three-member appeals court panel.
   In favoring the right of the newspaper to publish, he wrote:
``To allow a government to suppress free speech simply through a
system of bureaucratic classification would sell our heritage far,
far too cheaply.''
   Survivors include his wife, Helen, a son, James Skelly Wright
Jr., one brother, James Edward Wright Jr. of New Orleans, and three
sisters, Rosemary Ruckert and Katherine Hotard of New Orleans and
Margaret Hewes of Birmingham, Ala.

<HEAD>Jordan Will Recognize Exile Government; PLO Working On Declaration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HALABY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A week after abandoning any claim to the
Israeli-occupied West Bank, King Hussein says he would recognize
the establishment of a Palestinian government-in-exile and welcome
a PLO embassy in Amman.
   The Jordanian monarch made the comments to reporters Sunday as
draft documents calling for an independent Palestinian state
circulated in Israel's occupied lands, where the uprising entered
its ninth month today.
   By severing administrative ties with the West Bank, Hussein has
challenged the PLO to make good on its claims to leadership in the
territory that Israel seized from his family's control 21 years ago.
   Without hesitation, Hussein told foreign reporters on Sunday
that he would ``immediately'' recognize a Palestinian
government-in-exile.
   In Israel on Sunday, U.S. envoy Richard Murphy indicated the
United States had not abandoned hope Hussein will play an important
role in the peace process.
   ``Jordan has been and will remain a strategic anchor for peace
in the region,'' the assistant secretary of state told reporters.
``(Hussein's) interest is in peace, and I assume his actions were
taken toward that goal.''
   U.S. policy under the Reagan administration has relied heavily
on Jordan as a stand-in for the PLO, which Israel refuses to
recognize.
   Murphy was scheduled to travel to Jordan today for talks.
   He said dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization is
possible, but Israeli Prime Minister Yitzak Shamir told Murphy that
U.S. contacts with the PLO would only lead to further violence in
the occupied lands.
   Despite the Israeli occupation, Jordan has maintained heavy
economic and political ties with the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Its
dinar is the dominant currency and many Palestinians carry
Jordanian passports.
   In the past two weeks, the king has scrapped a $1.3-billion
development plan for the territories, laid off or retired 21,200
Jordanian employees there and shut the separate ministry for
territorial affairs in his government.
   He said Sunday the option of reversing these measures ``does not
exist.''
   ``We are in a new reality of position,'' the king said in a
somber tone, adding: ``Jordan has no sovereignty over the West Bank
and Gaza ... both belong to the Palestinian people.''
   It is not clear how Hussein's moves may affect the Palestinian
uprising in the occupied lands, which has claimed the lives of at
least 237 Arabs and four Israelis.
   But Palestinians and others have suggested Hussein is trying to
pressure the PLO to make good on its claims of Palestinian
leadership. If the PLO fails, the argument goes, Jordan might be
ready to step back in.
   Commenting on measures to be taken regarding citizenship, the
king said that ``passports will all remain (with Jordanian citizens
of Palestinian origin) until a Palestinian state is created and
they can choose their own citizenship.''
   Hussein also denied media reports that both bridges linking
Jordan with the West Bank are to be closed down.
   ``Bridges are the lifeline,'' he said. ``We have no intension to
close them ... nor has it (the idea) crossed our minds.''
   The king said he hoped to see the PLO's mission in Amman ``enjoy
the diplomatic status like other missions ... like an embassy.''
   He said, however, that ``we have nothing to say to the PLO
delegation'' that is due to visit Jordan later in the week, though
adding ``we shall keep in touch in the future ... there are no
differences between us.''
   Palestinian sources in the occupied territories, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Sunday that a draft of a declaration
of independence had been forwarded to the PLO for approval.
   The Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot on Sunday published what it
said was a draft declaration of independence signed by 152
Palestinians.
   The declaration called for a state based on a 1947 U.N.
partition plan, which would encompass much of Israel's northern
Galilee and Arab east Jerusalem as well as the West Bank and Gaza.
   A different draft obtained by The Associated Press made no
mention of 1947 borders, calling for a state in the West Bank and
Gaza with Arab east Jerusalem as its capital.
   Both draft versions said PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat would be
president of a government-in-exile.
   Israel television on Saturday said one draft version of the
declaration was seized by Israeli security forces during a search
at the east Jerusalem Arab Studies Institute immediately after the
institute's leader, Faisal Husseini, was arrested on Aug. 1.

<HEAD>Writers Ratify Contract; Producers Gear Up to Salvage Devastated
TV Season</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Writers are back to work trying to salvage the
fall TV season after ratifying a contract that ends one of
Hollywood's longest strikes, but it could be weeks before scripts
reach producers.
   Some scriptwriters sat down in front of word processors and
typewriters after the Writers Guild of America overwhelming
ratified the four-year contract Sunday.
   ``A lot of them are already going to work and they will be
working night and day now. Business is going to be booming,'' said
Cheryl Rhoden, spokeswoman for the Writers Guild of America.
   ``Most people expect to see the first finished scripts for
episodes in about four weeks.''
   The guild approved the pact with the Alliance of Motion Picture
and Television Producers by 2,111 to 412, or 83.7 percent, said
guild President George Kirgo.
   The 22-week walkout by the 9,000 members crippled Hollywood and
will delay the start of the fall TV season, perhaps until November.
   Writer Dave Fuller was anxious to return to work on a new HBO
series and feature film he is co-writing with partner Rick Natain.
   ``I'm going to try to pick up all the momentum we lost during
the 22-week layoff,'' Fuller said.
   Ratification came in the 154th day of the longest strike ever to
cause a major disruption of film and television production.
Hollywood has endured a more protracted strike, involving
musicians, but the Writers Guild's longest previous walkout, in
1960, lasted 153 days.
   The impact of the strike, which began March 7, reached beyond
writers, producers and behind-the-scenes personnel, affecting
businesses including equipment rentals and caterers and has cost
the television networks tens of millions of dollars.
   Producers are ``pleased that the WGA membership has ratified the
new agreement and we are able once again to get this industry back
to work,'' said Nicholas Counter III, president of the 217-member
alliance.
   Divisiveness, however, was expected to linger, Ms. Rhoden said.
   ``It was a very difficult time. Over a period of time, some of
the rancor and anger will be forgotten. I don't think the spirit
will be forgotten, though. They (the writers) will remember this
for a long time,'' she said.
   The financial loss to union members was estimated at $500,000
each week, and the guild paid out more than $2 million in hardship
loans to members.
   The median income for working union members is $43,000, although
the guild does have some millionaires.
   In arguing for acceptance of the proposal, guild negotiators
said the pact would provide writers more creative control over
scripts and over the re-acquisition of original screenplays. But
the union acknowledged it was not very successful in winning larger
payments for reruns of television programs sold to foreign markets,
a major strike issue.
   ``We went in looking for modest improvements and we made
achievements in all those areas,'' Ms. Rhoden said.
   Writers will choose between the existing formula, which pays a
maximum of about $4,400 for a one-hour show rerun abroad, or a plan
that pays 1.2 percent of the producer's foreign sales, within a
range of 85 percent to 130 percent of the current payment.
   Television producers usually make up production costs with their
share of payments for reruns of prime-time shows.
   Rising production costs and reduced demand for expensive
hourlong shows prompted the producers to propose revisions for
domestic reruns.
   Under the new formula, payments for domestic one-hour reruns
would be tied to sales of the show as opposed to a set dollar
amount.
   Writers have been earning about $16,000 for one-hour programs,
but under the new system that could range from $8,000 to $24,000,
depending on the syndication sales. Writers can seek a return to
the fixed-payment formula through binding arbitration if the
syndication market improves.
   The contract also calls for salary increases of 5 percent in the
first 18 months, another 5 percent in the next 18 months and 4.5
percent the fourth year.

   Retired federal Judge J. Skelly Wright, who
participated in the Pentagon Papers case and wrote the decree
ending de facto segregation in the nation's capital, died Saturday
of cancer. He was 77.
   His retirement last year after 25 years on the U.S. Court of
Appeals here _ two as chief judge _ and 13 years as a U.S. District
Judge in his native city of New Orleans ended a judicial career in
which he played a key role in many cases involving conflicts
between the rights of citizens and the powers of the federal
government.
   After Wright's 1960 order desegregating the New Orleans school
system, President Kennedy reassigned him to Washington, D.C. In
1967, Wright issued an order that overturned the District school
system's racially separate ``tracking system'' for grouping
students. The ``Wright decree,'' in addressing de facto
segregation, was considered one of the most significant education
rulings since the 1954 Supreme Court decision outlawing ``separate
but equal.''
   In the 1971 Pentagon Papers case that involved an attempt by the
government on national security grounds to restrain publication by
The Washington Post of portions of the documents, Wright dissented
from the ruling of two other judges on a three-member appeals court
panel.
   In favoring the right of the newspaper to publish, he wrote:
``To allow a government to suppress free speech simply through a
system of bureaucratic classification would sell our heritage far,
far too cheaply.''

She was 79.
   She and her husband, the late Elmo Coney, founded the
neighborhood group Citizens Forum in 1964 to combat housing
discrimination against blacks.
   It grew into an effort to collect trash, plant trees and watch
out for neighbors in poor, inner-city areas. She ran the volunteer
group until she and her husband retired in 1981.
   Groups modeled after Citizens Forum sprang up in Detroit,
Washington, D.C., and other cities. Six times, her work was

<TEXT>
   U.S. officials are sending a team to a remote
part of Somalia this week to see what can be done to help hundreds
of thousands of refugees in the war-ravaged Horn of Africa.
   Rebel fighting in Somalia on Africa's east coast has caused more
than 200,000 refugees to flee into Ethiopia, moving at the rate of
1,000 a day since heavy fighting erupted last May, officials say.
   ``Because of the war, we are in the dark,'' said Bart Kull, a
spokesman for the Agency for International Development. ``Their
purpose is to try to assess what may be needed in terms of
humanitarian assistance.''
   The fighting, however, may prevent the U.S. team from going near
the northern area, officials said. U.N. officials evacuated their
people from the region in June for safety reasons, said Patricia
Fagan, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commission on Refugees.
   ``The whole Horn of Africa is in turmoil,'' she said.

   Defense officials say the Soviet Union has
resumed sending nuclear submarines to off America's east coast
after refraining from the patrols for several months.
   The officials, who agreed to discuss the matter only if not
identified, disclosed last week that a lone Soviet ``Yankee'' sub
reappeared during the first week of June inside an Atlantic patrol
zone long favored by the Russians.
   The submarine was replaced by another Yankee after completing
its deployment, suggesting the Soviets intend to maintain the
patrols at least for the time being, the officials said.
   Rear Adm. William O. Studeman, the director of naval
intelligence, acknowledged Friday that the Soviets had resumed
U.S.-coast patrols with the Yankee subs. The Navy's intelligence
office added in a statement, without explanation: ``We anticipate
that Yankees will periodically patrol off our coasts, but not on
the regular basis that had been the case prior to 1987.''

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A terrorist attack aboard a cruise ship
last month has frightened thousands of Americans away from this
country that depends so highly on foreign vacationers, tourism
officials report.
   Aegean Sea island-hopping cruises have begun to regain
popularity but hotel and tourism officials say the July 11 gun and
grenade assault aboard the City of Poros cruise ship led to a wave
of hotel cancellations.
   The terrorist action left nine dead and more than 90 injured.
The attack occurred as the City of Poros returned from a one-day
island-hopping tour with 471 passengers aboard.
   Killed in the attack were three French citizens, two Hungarians,
a Dane, a Swede and two unidentified men. No Americans were among
the casualties.
   Greek security officials have still not established who was
responsible for the assault and no arrests have been made in
connection with the case. The Abu Nidal organization, a Palestinian
group known for other terrorist attacks, is suspected of
involvement.
   Most of the hotel cancellations have been by American business
people who planned to attend conferences in the Greek capital and
American vacationers on tour groups, hotel officials said. They
said Europeans did not appear to have been frightened away by the
attack.
   ``Three major business conferences that were to be attended by
some 900 Americans were canceled almost immediately after the ship
massacre,'' Eva Veloudakis, public relations manager at the
Intercontinental Hotel in Athens told The Associated Press.
   About 400,000 American vacationers were expected to visit Greece
in 1988, a 65 percent increase over last year's figure of 260,000,
leading tourism officials said.
   According to Joanne Despotopoulou of the government's National
Tourist Organization, about 4,000 Americans canceled their visits
in the immediate aftermath of the attack.
   Tour operators estimated the figure was much higher.
   ``Since the attack we've had a great drop in American
visitors,'' said a tour operator who asked not to be named.``Our
bookings are down by approximately 10 percent compared to last
year.''
   ``Cruises are gradually picking up again but there was a
noticeable slump in their popularity following the attack,'' said
Ms. Despotopoulou. ``A lot of tourists, and particularly the
Japanese, stopped going on them and took up classical tours by bus
instead.''
   In 1987, 8 million tourists visited Greece, led by Britons and
West Germans, totaling 1.9 million and 1.2 million respectively.
   Tourism is Greece's biggest foreign exchange earner. According
to the Bank of Greece, tourists brought in approximately $2.2
billion in foreign exchange in 1988, more than 5 percent of the
country's gross national product.
   American visitors to Greece dropped dramatically in 1985, when
the United States issued a travel advisory on the potential danger
of flying to Athens after the hijacking of a TWA jetliner.
   The plane was seized during a flight from Athens to Rome.
   A U.S navy diver was murdered by the hijackers and 39 other
poeple were held captive for 17 days until their eventual release
in Beirut, Lebanon.
   Greece lost $100 million in tourism revenues because of
terrorism in 1985, according to official figures of the European
Economic Community.
   The cruise ship industry _ always popular among high income
earners _ was the hardest hit, with Americans canceling 35 percent
of their bookings.
   When the 1985 advisory was lifted after six weeks, the Greek
government set about trying to lure tourists, especially Americans,
with an expensive publicity campaign.
   Top tourism officials say the country plans a similar publicity
campaign in an effort to blunt negative reaction from last month's
attack.

   The dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen
Monday, while share prices fell.
   The dollar opened the week at 133.80 yen, up from last Friday's
133.12 yen close, and finished the day at 133.97 yen. Its high was
134.05 yen Monday and its low was 133.72 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 61.20-point loser during Saturday's half-day
session, continued its slide and closed at 28,253.12 points, down
109.60 points or 0.38 percent.
   Traders attributed the U.S. currency's strength against the yen
to its rise on overseas markets late last week. The dollar rose to
a 19-month high against the West German mark in New York last
Friday, propped up in part by strong earnings and payroll figures
in the July U.S. employment report released by the U.S. Labor
Department last week.
   Speculative mark-selling fueled the dollar's rise, the traders
added.
   Dealers on the stock exchange said sluggishness during the
summer holidays contributed to quiet, thin trading.
   ``This week and next week is the holiday season in Japan,'' said
Michio Katsumata of Nomura Securities, Japan's largest brokerage.
``The market is very quiet and the trading volume is very thin.''

<HEAD>Galveston Voters Go To Polls Again on Casino Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF AWALT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GALVESTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the third time in four years,
residents vote on a referendum to allow casinos, with the
opposition saying approval could return Galveston to the days when
illegal gambling and prostitution flourished.
   But Galvestonians for Economic Development, the pro-gambling
group that initiated a petition to bring the issue before voters
Saturday, speak of the jobs and money such an industry could bring
to this tourist-oriented island city suffering high unemployment.
   The contest has been a feverish, complete with phone banks,
rallies and an advertising war.
   ``It's been very divisive. It's a decision between two entirely
different choices for the future of our city,'' said H.L. ``Shrub''
Kempner Jr., co-chairman of Galvestonians Against Casino Gambling.
   ``It is a question of whether we become contaminated by the
casinos ... in terms of trashing our town or whether we move on
toward other ways of developing our economy,'' Kempner said.
   The non-binding referendum asks voters in this scity of nearly
200,000 residents to approve a gambling district that proponents
say will consist of four casino hotels with at least 500 rooms each.
   Voters rejected legalized gambling proposals in 1984 and 1987.
But gambling promoters say last November's statewide approval of
pari-mutuel horse racing signals a change in attitude that will be
reflected in voter approval Saturday.
   They also are optimistic that proposals to limit the size of the
district and earmark a percentage of its proceeds to benefit the
elderly will help win support.
   ``It's similar to ... pari-mutuel gambling and bingo and lots of
other things in state of Texas that had to be attempted several
times,'' said Pete Fredriksen, chairman of Galvestonians for
Economic Development.
   Both sides admit that polls show voters evenly split on the
gambling question, with about 10 percent to 15 percent undecided.
The winner may well be decided by which side gets the highest
turnout.
   The referendum, if approved, would require the passage of
similar legislation in the state House and Senate before returning
for a binding local-option vote.
   Rep. Lloyd Criss supports the casino district, while Rep. James
Hury, a former Galveston County district attorney, opposes it.
State Sen. Chet Brooks, meanwhile, says he is duty-bound to
introduce the legislation if it passes.
   Law enforcement officials also have joined in the debate.
   ``When we study what's happened with casino gambling in other
locations, we see a tremendous amount of street crime and we also
see organized crime's involvement with casinos,'' said County
District Attorney Mike Guarino, adding that tax benefits would be
outweighed by the increased demands on law enforcement and courts.
   But Fredrikson dismisses such speculation.
   ``I keep telling them, `Guys, you've been watching too many
``Godfather'' movies,''' he said.
   ``We believe that these casinos would be an economic tool to
expand our economy. The estimates are that they would create 20,000
direct and indirect jobs and put over $600 million on the tax rolls
here,'' Fredrikson said.
   Galveston's unemployment rate this year has ranged from 11
percent to 8.9 percent, according to the Texas Employment
Commission. Its 9.7 percent June rate compared with nearby
Houston's 7.7 percent, and ranked 21st out of 27 metropolitan areas
in the state.
   Galveston became a haven of crime and vice in the 1950s before a
government crackdown ran casino and slot machine operators out of
business.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Publications on teen fashion, television and
horse racing are the newest divergent entries in Rupert Murdoch's
wide-ranging communications empire.
   Murdoch's $3 billion agreement to buy Triangle Publications,
publishers of TV Guide, Seventeen magazine and the Daily Racing
Form, from Walter Annenberg was announced Sunday.
   It was the latest deal by a man who parlayed a small family
newspaper in his native Australia into billions of dollars in
broadcasting, book, newspaper and magazine holdings on four
continents, including the fledgling Fox Television Network.
   The prospect of having the same man own TV Guide and a
television network raised some eyebrows, but Murdoch said the
popular magazine will be operated independently from his other
holdings.
   Murdoch, now a United States citizen, assumed ownership of his
father's paper, the tiny Adelaide News, and built from there. His
wife, Anna Murdoch, met him while working as a reporter at one of
his Australian papers.
   In 1969, he purchased The Sun, a London-based tabloid. In
addition to sensationalist stories, Murdoch added daily photos of
bare-breasted women. Circulation soared from 950,000 to 4 million.
Later, he took over the respected newspapers The Times and The
Sunday Times of London.
   Murdoch's early U.S. acquisitions included the San Antonio
(Texas) Express and News, a daily newspaper, and the National Star,
a weekly gossip magazine. He owned both when he paid $30 million
for the New York Post in 1976.
   Though bare breasts did not become a commonplace on the pages of
the Post, other aspects of his style were evident: conservative
editorial stance, screaming headlines, outrageous stories.
Circulation increased, but did not bring a similar increase in
advertising revenue.
   But if he lost millions at the Post, the rest of his empire
flourished: Profits for the News Corporation Ltd., his worldwide
company, were 32 times higher when Murdoch sold the paper in
February than when he bought it 12 years earlier.
   While running the Post, Murdoch also purchased the iconoclastic
liberal weekly the Village Voice, which he has since sold, and New
York magazine. Adweek named him Publisher of the Year in 1982.
   Murdoch moved to Manhattan during the mid-1970s. After becoming
an American citizen in 1985, he began buying television stations.
   But an enemy made with his stance at the Post came back to haunt
him. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., got legislation passed setting
an imminent deadline for enforcement of a Federal Communications
Commission rule requiring Murdoch to end his dual ownership of
newspapers and television stations in Boston and New York.
   During his presidential run in 1980, Kennedy was hammered
repeatedly by the Post. Murdoch papers also delighted in running
photos of an overweight Kennedy with headlines like ``Tubby Teddy.''
   ``You seldom achieve big things in life without making some
enemies on the way,'' Murdoch said earlier this year.
   Murdoch still owns the San Antonio paper; his other U.S.
newspaper holding is the Boston Herald. His efforts these days are
focused on converting Fox into the nation's fourth commercial
network.
   And Murdoch has promised to keep looking for new deals.
   ``Now you're going to see joint ventures and start-ups _ new
newspapers, magazines and television services,'' Murdoch said five
months before swinging the $3 billion Triangle Publications deal.

   With the sale of Triangle Publications Inc.,
former U.S. Ambassador Walter H. Annenberg leaves a business his
father began but he saved, partially with the addition of the
highly successful TV Guide.
   Annenberg and Rupert Murdoch on Sunday announced that Murdoch's
News Corp. would buy the Radnor-based Triangle Publications for $3
billion.
   The sale will give Murdoch The Daily Racing Form, Seventeen
magazine and TV Guide, the largest-selling weekly magazine in the
country with an audited circulation of more than 17 million copies.
   The 80-year-old Annenberg, chairman of Triangle and friend of
President Reagans, also claimed The Philadelphia Inquirer and the
Philadelphia Daily News in his empire until 1969, when he sold the
papers to Knight Newspapers Inc., a forerunner of Knight-Ridder Inc.
   Annenberg, in a statement, said: ``I am very happy that my
publications are passing to Mr. Murdoch's company. I now plan to
devote the rest of my life to education and philanthropy.''
   Born in 1908, Annenberg was the son of Moses Annenberg, who
owned Daily Racing Form and General News Bureau, which transmitted
race results from tracks to bookie offices.
   But while Moses Annenberg made money, up to $6 million a year,
he failed to comply with U.S. tax laws and was sentenced in 1940 to
three years' imprisonment for tax invasion. He was released for
treatment of a brain tumor and died in 1942.
   Walter Annenberg's biographers say the death of his father
provided the impetus for the son's career.
   A plaque kept by Annenberg states his driving force, ``Cause my
works on earth to reflect honor on my father's memory.'' His motto
is, ``Adversity. It either inspires you or destroys you.''
   In his 30s, Walter took over the family business, including the
papers but minus the wire company. The business was worth $3
million to $4 million, but the family's debts included $4 million
in back taxes.
   To pay off the debts, Walter streamlined the business and sold
real estate.
   Forbes magazine puts Annenberg's personal worth now at $1
billion. His share of Triangle is 35 percent.
   Annenberg divides his time between three homes: a mansion in
suburban Philadelphia, a 273-acre spread in Rancho Mirage, Calif.,
where he plays host to the Reagans, and a home in Colorado with a
view of Pikes Peak.
   He was appointed U.S. ambassador to the Court of St. James by
then-President Richard Nixon and was later made an honorary knight.
   Annenberg is also known for his art collection, which includes
works by Cezanne, Renoir, Matisse and van Gogh. He estimates its
value at $400 million.
   Annenberg has donated millions to charities and the arts, and
founded the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of
Communications. He has given a third of Triangle stock, worth $300
million, to the Penn school.
   In February, he donated $10 million to his old prep school, the
Peddie School in Hightstown, N.J.
   Besides his wife, Leonore, Annenberg's immediate family includes
a daughter, Wallis, and five elderly sisters. His only son
committed suicide.
   Annenberg told Fortune magazine last year that ``capitalists
have a fundamental responsibility to operate with respect for the
citizenry. If we get too greedy, we're going to end up like pigs in
the slaughterhouse.''

<HEAD>President Of State-Run Railroad Resigns After Second Fatal Wreck</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state-run railroad's chief resigned after a
second fatal train crash in six weeks and union leaders claimed the
accidents stemmed from the government cutting corners at the
expense of safety.
   Transport Minister Michel Delebarre said he accepted the
resignation offered Sunday by 53-year-old Philippe Rouvillois, who
had been president of the railroad for just six months.
   Union leaders said the Rouvillois' resignation would only gloss
over a fundamental problem _ the government's scrimping on safety
to save money.
   A 29-year-old man was killed and 57 people were injured Saturday
when a four-car passenger train crashed into a barrier at the end
of the line in Paris' Gare de L'Est station.
   On June 27, a train crash at another Paris station, the Gare de
Lyon, killed 56 people and injured 32. That accident was blamed on
brake failure.
   Seven of Saturday's injured remained hospitalized Sunday, none
of them in a life-threatening condition, hospital officials said.
   An initial investigation indicated the cause of Saturday's crash
was mechanical failure _ not human error.
   The railroad, known by its French initials as SNCF, said the
conductor applied the brakes, which appeared to work normally, but
the engine drove the train into the barrier anyway.
   The two major accidents and several minor incidents have
heightened concern about safety on the railroads.
   On Saturday night, Delebarre said instructions given by the
government after the June 27 crash had not been adequately followed.
   ``I don't believe in fate,'' he said. ``The safety instructions
given on July 20 to the (railroad) board of directors ... remain
still insufficiently followed up.''
   Those measures included stricter checks on braking equipment,
more training of mechanics on brake equipment, and installation of
telephone links between passenger cars and the driver.
   In 1985, during a series of three accidents in which 75 died and
nearly 200 were injured, SNCF President Andre Chadeau also resigned.
   ``You can change a man once again, but you will only solve the
problems by answering their causes,'' said the Socialist-run French
Democratic Confederation of Labor. The Communist-led General
Confederation of Labor, France's largest union, said, ``The
government is trying to camouflage its own responsibility.''
   Both unions blamed the accidents on the government's railroad
policy, which they say is based mainly on saving money. The current
plan is to reduce the SNCF's work force by 10,000 a year over the
next four years.
   Railway officials said the driver during Saturday's crash told
them he noticed nothing unusual during his run from Chateau
Thierry, 60 miles northeast of Paris, until he entered the Gare de
L'Est.
   Then, he said, he applied the brakes but could not stop the
train.
   A review of the train's black-box recorder indicated the driver
correctly braked and the train slowed down, SNCF officials said.
But the recording showed that while braking appeared normal, the
engine continued to push the train, which entered the station at 12
mph to 19 mph.
   ``It's like having your foot on the accelerator and the brake at
the same time,'' said SNCF spokesman Yves Chenel.
   The train, which Chenel said was about four years old, is what
is known as a ``reversible,'' meaning it can be either pulled by an
engine or pushed by it. When it is pushed, the driver controls the
train from a cabin in the first car.
   The train was being pushed when the first car slammed into the
barrier, rode up on it and twisted at a right angle. The other
three cars and the engine remained on the tracks.
   Most likely, there was a malfunction in the control cable
connecting the driving cabin in the first car and the engine at the
rear, the railway officials said.
   Separate investigations were being carried out by the railroad
and police.

<TEXT>
   A man was reunited with his wife
early today, five hours after he drove away from a gas station
thinking she was asleep in the back only to find out she had gone
to the restroom, police said.
   Edward K. Hart, 62, of Huber Heights, Ohio, realized his wife,
Emma Lou, 56, was missing after he stopped 100 miles away at a
McDonald's, bought her a cheeseburger but found the back of his van
empty upon returning.
   Hart went back to the gas station, but it was closed. He then
contacted state police. They directed him to a state police
barracks where his wife was waiting for him.
   ``I stopped to get some gas. As I went out and slammed the door
she went out the other door to go to the bathroom,'' Hart said
today. ``I went down the road about 100 miles to get something to
eat and she wasn't there.''
   ``It was just one of those things that happen,'' said Hart, a
retired businessman. ``She understood. She forgave me.''
   Tim Hart, 19, said both parents called home _ but the father
called before the children learned where their mother was.
   The Harts were traveling south from Marion, Mass., on their way
back to Ohio after a weeklong vacation in New England.

   A 101-year-old former lumberjack climbed to the top
of Mount Fuji today, breaking his own record as the oldest person
to scale Japan's tallest peak.
   Teiichi Igarashi reached the 12,385-foot summit this morning
after an arduous three-day climb during which he slept in huts
along the trail, Kyodo News Service reported.
   Surrounded by 11 relatives, he climbed steadily, stopping to
rest every 30 seconds and supported by his 64-year-old son
Toshikazu, Kyodo said.
   It takes most adults about six hours to climb the mountain.
   Igarashi has scaled the stately peak 13 times since his wife
died in 1975 and he vowed to make the journey in her memory. He
broke the record for most senior climber in 1983 at age 96.
   ``Owing to the kindness of all, I was able to make the climb
again this year ... thank you very much,'' Kyodo quoted Igarashi as
saying at the summit.
   Igarashi was a lumberjack and forest ranger near his home in
Fukushima, about 150 miles northeast of Tokyo, before he retired 11
years ago at age 90.
   Last August, 91-year-old Hulda Crooks of Loma Linda, California
became the oldest woman to reach the summit of the dormant volcano.

   Jesse Jackson says blacks and Jews should form
a council to air their disagreements, a step he advocated in a
meeting with Israeli Ambassador Moshe Arad.
   Jackson met Sunday with Arad in a session that both men
described as cordial but which also included disagreements over the
Middle East, most notably Jackson's call for Palestinian self-rule.
   Jackson said that during the 2{-hour meeting at Arad's home, he
proposed creating ``some kind of council'' or ``conduit for
communication'' so that the two groups, historical allies on civil
rights, can talk with each other when they disagree.
   Arad, in an interview today with Israeli state radio, said he
tried to make clear to Jackson that private citizens should not try
to mediate the Middle East conflict.
   ``One cannot expect people, no matter how talented or
well-known, to mediate between us and our neighbors. It is more
appropriate to leave these kinds of jobs to governments
concerned,'' Arad said he told Jackson.
   ``I also noted the very disconcerting anti-Semitic phenomena
that have been reported recently, especially in his city, Chicago,
and I noted that ... his voice was not heard in condemnation,''
Arad said.
   The former Democratic presidential candidate, who has a history
of poor relations with Jewish groups, initiated the meeting with
Arad. After the session, Jackson told reporters he had invited Arad
to visit him in Chicago, his home town.
   Jackson is supporting Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis'
campaign, but said he acted independently in setting up the meeting
with the ambassador.
   Although Jackson said he and Arad did not shy away from
controversial subjects, he refused to detail many of the points of
contention. ``I did share my points of view,'' he said, adding he
would ``keep them private.''
   Rather, Jackson stressed that the meeting allowed the men to get
to know each other personally.
   Jackson said he did advocate self-determination for the
Palestinians along with security for Israel, an issue the men
delved into in ``depth and detail.''
   ``Israelis and Palestinians are trapped in a death grip'' which
must be broken, Jackson said. He said he would ultimately like to
see an international peace conference on the Middle East.
   Arad issued a statement in which he said the session ``provided
a useful opportunity to review the situation in the Middle East,
especially the Arab-Israeli conflict, to discuss issues of mutual
concern and to clarify points of difference.''
   Atlanta businessman Ed Elson, chairman of the American Jewish
Committee, described the mood at the meeting which he helped to
organize as ``gracious, generous.'' New York businessman Peter
Strauss and Rep. Mervin Dymally, D-Calif., also took part in the
meeting.
   Jackson's relations with the organized Jewish community have
long been strained by a number of factors, including his strong
support for Palestinian rights and a derogatory remark about Jews
in the 1984 campaign.

   Thunderstorms swept across sections of the Midwest, South and
Northeast today after causing damage in sections of Minnesota and
Wisconsin.
   An intense line of thunderstorms that developed ahead of a cold
front spawned high winds that blew down trees and power lines in
southeast Minnesota and western Wisconsin on Sunday evening. The
thunderstorms weakened overnight and drifted into central Wisconsin
and northern Iowa.
   Other thunderstorms rumbled across northern Georgia, southern
Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi early today.
   Rain and thunderstorms were scattered across eastern Nebraska,
western Kansas, Vermont, New Hampshire and the Carolinas.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms scattered
from Florida across southeast Louisiana; and from upper Michigan
into central Colorado.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 70s to 80s over the
northern Atlantic Coast states, Pennsylvania, the Great Lakes
region, upper Mississippi Valley, Northern Plains, upper Missouri
Valley, the Northwest and along the California coast; near 100 over
much of Oklahoma and the eastern Texas; between near 100 and 110
over the Desert Southwest; and 90s across most of the rest of the
nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 45
degrees at Kalispell, Mont., to 93 at Phoenix, Ariz.

   Overcrowding and safety violations caused
an aging ferry to capsize in the Ganges River, killing as many as
400 people, a government report said. The ferry accident was said
to be India's worst ever.
   Strong currents hampered efforts today to pull the two-decker
from the rising monsoon-swollen river. Hundreds of relatives stood
by watching.
   A senior government official, discussing the confidential report
on condition of anonymity, said authorities believed at least 300
people on the lower deck died when the ferry overturned Saturday
morning.
   About 200 people were on the upper deck, he said. Authorities
believe about 100 people swam to safety or were rescued by
villagers.
   Only about a dozen bodies have been found, and most of the
missing were believed trapped inside the 35-year-old ferry.
   ``It was badly overcrowded. The situation was made more
dangerous by wheat bags loaded on the ferry. Many lives could have
been saved if the ferry had carried water safety equipment such as
life jackets,'' said the senior official.
   Survivors said they protested when 150 bags of wheat were loaded
onto the ferry. The steam-powered vessel started wavering soon
after it left the banks and capsized about 100 yards from the shore.
   Navy divers attempted to reach the submerged boat today, but the
river was too muddy and its current too swift, said H.S. Pathak,
head of the eight-member diving team.
   ``We are trying our best, but because of the current, we are not
able to go near the launch,'' Pathak said. ``The water is too
muddy. We can't see anything, so we just have to feel by our
hands.''
   Authorities said the water was still rising and the submerged
boat was sinking in the river bed. The water depth was estimated at
12 to 30 feet.
   Katihar Commissioner Madan Mohan Singh estimated the boat was
resting in about six feet of sand.
   ``We are planning to break the ferry. Only then will we be able
to get the bodies out,'' Singh said.
   Katihar District Police Chief P.S. Natarajah said chances of
finding any survivors were ``very, very dim.''
   He said the death toll may never be known because some bodies
probably were carried downstream 30 to 60 miles by the surging
water.
   The ferry was designed to carry about 160 people, but was was
always overcrowded, he said. Jetty workers, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said 535 tickets were sold for the trip.
   Katihar Police Inspector N. Kumar said about 2,000 relatives and
residents were waiting along the rain-swollen river for the bodies
to be recovered.
   ``Police are trying to control the crowds and console them,'' he
said.
   Family members railed against authorities as numerous officials
arrived to review recovery efforts.
   ``Give back our family members. We don't want (government)
ministers,'' they shouted.
   One survivor, Chadrasekhar D. Tiwary, said he was standing on
the ferry's upper deck when it started wavering.
   ``As soon as the ferry tilted, I knew we were going down. I saw
three women crying for help. They probably drowned,'' the
50-year-old farmer said.
   Ram Prasad Yadaw's wife and four other family members vanished
in the accident.
   ``The women and children suffered the worst. They had to sit on
the lower deck,'' he said. ``I am sure my wife is dead.''
   It was the worst boat accident ever in India, according to the
United News of India. At least 150 people died on July 5, 1970,
when a boat capsized in Krishna River in eastern India.
   The Navy divers came from New Delhi, the Indian capital about
650 miles west of Katihar.
   Mangan Chand, a police officer, said only one body surfaced near
the ferry Sunday. Ten to 12 bodies were found Saturday, according
to Bihar state officials.
   Chand said his father and uncle were aboard the ferry. He said
he was waiting for the bodies so he could cremate them according to
Hindu rites.
   The boat trip is normally used by Hindu pilgrims going across
the river to worship at a shrine of Lord Shiva in Deoghar town.
Lord Shiva is the destroyer diety in the Hindu trinity.
   Boat accidents are common during the annual monsoon rains when
major rivers overflow their banks.

<HEAD>Slain Beatle Portrayed as Reclusive, Anorexic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Lennon spent much of a three-year span
tucked away in his room, sleeping or sitting in a lotus position
with his head enveloped in tobacco or marijuana smoke, according to
a biography of the slain Beatle.
   An excerpt from the book, ``The Lives of John Lennon'' by
journalist and biographer Albert Goldman, appearing in the Aug. 15
issue of People magazine, discloses a sometimes unflattering
portrait of both Lennon and his second wife, Yoko Ono.
   The book is scheduled to be published later this month by
William Morrow & Co. Inc.
   Between 1976 and 1979, Goldman writes, Lennon ``could not be
more remote.''
   Apart from a few hours in the morning and evening, including
time spent with his son, Sean, ``Lennon is back here in his room,
alone and silent.''
   The author says the idolized Beatle spent most of his adult life
as an anorexic, starving himself to what he perceived as
perfection. The onset of the eating disorder can be traced to 1965,
Goldman writes, ``when some fool described him in print as the `fat
Beatle.' ''
   ``That phrase struck such a blow to his fragile ego that the
wound has never healed.''
   Lennon rarely wore clothing, other than a pair of backless
slippers, and avoided touching anyone, according to the book.
   The 719-page biography also details Yoko Ono's $5,000-a-week
heroin habit in 1979. She reportedly snorted the drug.
   According to the book, Lennon also took heroin and consumed a
great deal of LSD.
   ``I must have taken a thousand trips,'' the book quotes Lennon
as saying. ``I just ate it all the time like candy.''
   Goldman spent more than six years researching the book,
interviewing 1,200 friends, relatives and associates of Lennon, who
was murdered eight years ago in New York.

<HEAD>Khamenei: World Pressured Iraq To Drop Demand For Direct Talks

<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES with Iranian president saying war appears near its

Sunday. No pickup.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   President Ali Khamenei said today his
country's 8-year-old war with Iraq appears to be coming to a close
and claimed world opinion prompted Baghdad to drop its demand for
direct talks before a cease-fire.
   But Khamenei questioned Iraq's sincerity in wanting peace.
   His first public reference to the expected end of the fighting,
Khamenei's comments came at the opening of an international
conference of Islamic scholars and specialists in Third World
issues.
   He said the ``gathering fortunately is taking place in days when
the war that lasted eight years is apparently coming to a close.
   ``There is no doubt that the international public opinion put
pressure on Iraq,'' Khamenei said in his 40-minute speech. ``It is
under that pressure that Iraq was finally forced to accept a
cease-fire.''
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez to Cuellar announced Sunday
that both sides had agreed to a truce that is to take hold in about
two weeks.
   Iran had accepted Iraq's compromise offer that direct talks on a
lasting peace immediately follow a cease-fire. Before making the
offer Saturday, Iraq had insisted that direct talks precede a
cease-fire.
   Speaking without a prepared text, Khamenei said Iraq hesitated
to accept the cease-fire because it wanted to dictate conditions
for peace. Since the spring, Iran has suffered a string of
battlefield defeats.
   ``It would be good for the international community to question
their kind of approach,'' he said. ``It is this regime that should
be doubted. And its true devotion to peace should be looked upon
with great doubt.
   Iraq launched a major offensive against Iran shortly after
Tehran reversed itself and accepted a year-old U.N. cease-fire
resolution last month.
   Meanwhile, the official Islamic Republic News Agency said today
that three people were wounded on Sunday in three hours of Iraqi
shelling across the northern border.
   The Iranian capital is still dressed for war, but headlines
point to progress toward a cease-fire and the country's battered
economy has swiftly reacted to prospects for peace.
   Building entrances are still sandbagged, windows are taped to
prevent them from shattering in a missile explosion and yellow
signs show the way to the nearest air-raid shelter.
   But residents in Tehran, a city of 8 million, seem convinced
these remnants from the last Iraqi missile attacks in April will
disappear before long.
   There were no sensational headlines Sunday in Iran's afternoon
newspapers, which came out before the developments in New York but
after Tehran radio announced Iraq's compromise offer.
   ``New Developments in U.N. Talks for Cease-Fire'' said the small
headline in the Ettela'at newspaper.
   Iranians in the street did not seem surprised by news of the
developments, which broke an impasse in two weeks of U.N.-mediated
negotiations. There were few signs of exuberance.
   ``People were sure the end would come sooner or later,'' said
Said, a middle-aged, English-speaking businessman. ``Iranians know
very well what's going on in the world, perhaps better than many
Westerners.''
   Amid hopes for a post-war recovery, the Iranian riyal has in the
past few weeks risen sharply against the dollar and other
currencies on the black market.
   The dollar was unofficially quoted at 300 riyals at noon Sunday.
This compared to 785 on Aug. 1, and 1,480 before Iran accepted a
U.N. cease-fire resolution on July 18.
   The driver of a vintage Chevrolet said he bought his well-kept
car second- hand eight years ago for 3.5 million riyals and two
months ago, he was offerered 10 million for it.
   ``Now the price is back where it was in 1981,'' he said with a
grin. ``That means the war is over.''

<TEXT>
   President Quett Masire and one of his
aides were injured when an engine on the presidential jet exploded
during a flight to a regional summit meeting in Angola, Masire's
office said today.
   The office said the 10-seater British Aerospace jet made an
emergency landing in the central Angolan town of Cuito Bie about
five minutes after the explosion Sunday afternoon.
   The plane reportedly was flying at 38,000 feet when the blast
occurred, about two hours after it left Gaborone for Angola's
capital, Luanda.
   The engine separated from the plane and fragments of it sprayed
into the cabin, injuring Masire and his chief of protocol, Bashi
Ikiitsing, the office said. Masire's injuries were described as
``minor lacerations'' in his back and he was reported to be
hospitalized in Luanda pending arrangements for him to return to
Gaborone.
   The plane was said to be carrying three crew members and seven
passengers, including Foreign Minister Gaositwe Chiepe and
Presidential Affairs Minister Ponatshego Kedikilwe.
   The Botswanans were scheduled to attend a one-day meeting of
leaders of six southern African states to discuss the latest
developments in negotiations to remove foreign troops from Angola
and end South African rule over South-West Africa, also known as
Namibia.

<TEXT>
   Chinese throughout Southeast Asia today
celebrated an auspicious once-in-a-century date _ 8-8-88 _ with a
wave of weddings, business openings and lavish parties.
   Some hospitals geared up for maternity ward gridlock as women
sought to bring their children into the world on the propitious day.
   And merchants spared no effort to use the date to promote
everything from fast food to real estate, while Hong Kong gamblers
tested their luck in a special lottery with a sweetened jackpot.
   Cantonese-speaking Chinese, who represent the vast majority of
Hong Kong's 5.7 million people and have large communities in
Singapore and Malaysia, have long considered eight to bring good
fortune.
   In the Cantonese dialect, the word for eight is ``baat,'' which
sounds like ``faat,'' the word for prosperity.
   That similarity of sound makes Aug. 8, 1988, a momentous
occasion for superstitious Chinese.
   ``Not only the Cantonese, but everyone is celebrating,'' said
Peter Lee at the Pure Mind, one of many restaurants reporting
record bookings for dinner in Malaysia, where more than one-third
of the 16 million people are ethnic Chinese.
   The big event in Hong Kong was a ceremony atop the new Bank of
China local headquarters to mark placement of the final beam in the
1,221-foot structure, which contractors claim is the tallest
building outside the United States and the fifth-tallest in the
world.
   Dignitaries assembled on the 70th floor to split a roast pig and
a keg of sake to celebrate the occasion.
   In Singapore, at least five buildings held official openings
today, including the 920-foot Overseas Union Bank Center.
   Many couples figured the best way to ensure a life of marital
bliss was to get married today.
   The Hong Kong government reported 278 couples registered to get
married today, a 130 percent increase from a week earlier. Scores
more tied the knot in Singapore, where a mass ceremony called
``Wedding Of The Century'' was held at Neptune Theater Restaurant.
   In Malaysia, the Subang Medical Center and other hospitals
reported nurses and doctors were asked to work overtime because of
expectant mothers wanting to give birth today, even if the birth
had to be induced.
   Malaysian doctors, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
women with Caesarean sections scheduled for other days this week
had asked that the procedure be done today.
   Businessmen, meanwhile, launched every conceivable promotion to
mark the date.
   In Singapore, one real estate agent offered ``a lucky discount''
of 8,888 Singapore dollars ($4,356.86) on a three-story house. A
Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in Malaysia offered 88 children
who turned 8 this month a meal as well as T-shirts sporting
``8888.''
   Several Hong Kong hotels ran promotions tied to the date. Diners
at the Loong Yuen Chinese Restaurant at the Holiday Inn Golden Mile
ate for free if their total bill included four 8s.
   The colony's lottery also held a special drawing today with a
jackpot enlarged by an additional 3,888,888 Hong Kong dollars
(nearly $500,000).
   Despite all the hoopla, local astrologers who consult the
traditional Chinese calendar dismissed suggestions that today was
the century's luckiest day.
   ``It is a good day, but not a special one,'' sniffed astrologer
``Rocky'' Sung Siu-kwong of Hong Kong in a recent interview.
   Indeed, today's scheduled opening of a new light-rail mass
transit system in Hong Kong was put off after a spate of test-run
accidents, including one that killed an 8-year-old boy.
   Little luck rubbed off on the colony's free-wheeling stock
exchange, where prices dropped slightly in light trading. In Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia, however, the commodity exchange launched trading
in cocoa futures to coincide with the date.
   Jiang Jong Yue, a self-described master of geomancy, palmistry,
astrology and name consultant in Malaysia, cautioned that 8-8-88
may not mean prosperity for all.
   He noted the Cantonese pronounciation for four is ``sei,'' the
same as the word that means to die. Since today's date has four
eights, he advised: ``Tread with caution and contain your greed.''

   A bedroom fire in a retirement home
killed one resident and sent smoke billowing through the rest of
the building, injuring 17 other residents and four rescuers,
officials said.
   ``It's a tragedy because one loss of life occurred,'' Fire Chief
Robert Pudney said after Sunday night's blaze. ``But it could have
been worse.''
   The fire at the Golden Age Retirement Home in this Fort
Lauderdale suburb was extinguished within 11 minutes, said Pudney,
adding that the fire's cause had not been determined. The home had
23 residents.
   The fire began in the room of a 75-year-old man who had been
warned not to smoke, said the home's owner.
   ``He's done this before,'' said Cherian Samuel. ``Twice we've
taken his lighter away.''
   Flames spread to a bathroom and an adjacent hallway, but the
thick black smoke caused most of the injuries.
   The smoke forced residents outside the building into a driving
rainstorm, where they gasped for air as they stood beneath yellow
tarpaulins awaiting transportation to a hospital.
   Frantic relatives began arriving at the home to search for loved
ones. A police spokesman said as many as 30 relatives awaited news.
   The injured were taken to Plantation General Hospital, Humana
Hospital Bennett and Broward General Medical Center. Most suffered
from smoke inhalation.
   The rescuers _ two police officers, a firefighter and a
paramedic _ also were treated for smoke inhalation.

   U.S. envoy Richard Murphy criticized Israel
today for failing to establish a dialogue with moderate
Palestinians and for the tough measures used against activists in
the occupied territories.
   His statements came after a 2{-hour meeting with Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin and military officials at the Defense
Ministry in Tel Aviv.
   ``I've discussed America's concern that there is insufficient
dialogue, shall we say, between Israel and the moderate
Palestinians,'' said Murphy, adding he was not suggesting Israel
talk to the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Murphy referred to sharp disagreements with Rabin over Israel's
handling of Palestinian activists.
   Since the uprising began Dec. 8 in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip, about 2,500 alleged agitators have been jailed for up
to six months without trial, the homes of 84 activists have been
demolished and 29 nationalists have been deported.
   ``We don't think they're the way to go. We don't agree with
Israel. On that we've had a very frank exchange,'' said Murphy, who
was to fly to Jordan later today.
   Israel radio said that because of U.S. pressure, Israel agreed
to file criminal charges against Faisal Husseini, a Palestinian who
on July 31 was ordered jailed for six months without trial. The
United States protested Husseini's detention without due process.
   Israeli officials claimed Husseini, who advocated dialogue with
Israeli officials, was a senior representative of PLO chief Yasser
Arafat's outlawed Fatah organization.
   A draft of a proposed Palestinian ``declaration of
independence'' was found by Israeli police in his Arab Studies
Center in Jerusalem and leaked to Israeli newspapers.
   An Israeli official who demanded anonymity confirmed Murphy and
Rabin disagreed on the measures used by Israel in the occupied
lands but said the subject was only a minor part of the agenda. He
said the exchange last only five minutes and Murphy's protest was
perfunctory.
   Speaking on Israel radio before the meeting, Rabin noted he had
held several meetings in recent weeks with Palestinian leaders from
the occupied territories, which Israel seized from Jordan and Egypt
during the 1967 Middle East war.
   The uprising in the occupied lands has left 237 Palestinians and
four Israelis dead.
   Rabin said he was willing to hold talks with Palestinian leaders
from the occupied territories, regardless of their demands, as long
as they are not affiliated with the PLO.
   But Rabin said the Middle East peace process is ``totally
frozen'' and will remain so until after the Israeli and U.S.
elections in November.
   Murphy disagreed, saying ``I don't think its something that
should wait for elections here, there or elsewhere.''
   ``We are encouraging the opening of channels of communications
which have gradually closed down over the last several months, and
we hope that will be undertaken,'' said Murphy.
   Rabin said he would welcome emergence of an indigenous
Palestinian leadership without links to the PLO.
   ``The moment there is Palestinian leadership which says to us,
`We are your partners for dialogue, with us you must reach an
agreement,' I will say immediately, `Let's sit around the table,'
'' Rabin said.
   In a rare display of unity, leaders of the Likud bloc and Labor
Party on Sunday spoke out against a document calling for the
declaration of an independent Palestinian state headed by Arafat.
   Labor and Likud reject negotiating with the PLO, outlawed in
Israel as a terrorist organization, and oppose establishing a
Palestinian state in the occupied lands.
   The origins of the declaration, details of which were published
for the first time on Israel television Saturday, remained a
mystery.
   Hanna Siniora, editor of the Jerusalem-based, pro-PLO, Al Fajr
daily, told Israel television it was ``the work of a Palestinian
think tank. It was passed around to find out the reaction of the
local leadership.''
   Siniora said the PLO leadership should endorse the document,
because ``it would positively affect the situation.''

<TEXT>
   Khartoum and three other Sudanese cities
were declared disaster areas after torrential rains caused floods
that left about 1 million people homeless, the Middle East News
Agency reported today.
   Foreign Minister Hussein Abu-Saleh of Sudan appealed for
international help at a news conference in his country's capital on
Sunday night, the Egyptian state-owned news agency said.
   Later today the news agency reported a serious food shortage
threatened Khartoum but that ``fewer than a dozen'' people died in
the floods Thursday and Friday.
   Cairo newspapers reported dozens of deaths in Sudan, some by
electrocution caused by broken power cables falling into flood
waters.
   The Middle East News Agency also reported anti-government riots
in some districts of Khartoum and said some schools and
universities were closed.
   The agency quoted Sudanese officials as saying the floods were
the worst there since 1946.
   In its unattributed report, the Egyptian agency painted a grim
picture of the situation in Khartoum.
   ``Public utilities in the capital continue to suffer from almost
complete paralysis for the third straight day,'' the report said.
   Khartoum's official Omdurman Radio has gone off the air, the
report said, and only a provincial government-owned radio station
at Wad Medani, 100 miles southeast of the capital, is broadcasting
for a few hours daily.
   Abu-Saleh said Khartoum, the eastern cities of Kassala and
Showak and the northern city of El-Damer were declared disaster
areas because of the flooding. Sudan's finance minister, Omar Nour
El-Dayem ,was quoted as saying about 1 million people were left
homeless because the floods destroyed thousands of dwellings. He
said 5,000 houses were washed away in the Khartoum area alone.
   Sudan has a population of about 23 million.
   Kassala, capital of the eastern province, is 250 miles east of
Khartoum. El-Damer lies 160 miles northeast of the capital.
   ``Entire villages and districts have been isolated by the
flooding, and rescue forces have not been able to reach them
because of the high water level,'' Abu-Saleh was quoted as saying.
He did not identify the affected areas.
   The ministers said flood waters cut telephone and telex
communications and caused power failures which, in turn, disrupted
public utilities.
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt ordered immediate relief for
Sudan, which traditionally has had close ties with Egypt.
   Five Egyptian C-130 military transport planes flew in tents,
medical supplies and food on Sunday. Another five planeloads went
to Khartoum today.
   The flooding has compounded Sudan's economic difficulties, which
include a chronic balance of payments deficit and a $12 billion
foreign debt.
   For several years, the country has been suffering from food
shortages, including bread, increased commodity prices and
deficient public utilities.
   These problems frequently touched off public unrest. Last week
people rioted in Khartoum on three successive days to protest water
and bread shortages and electric power cuts. Police used tear gas
to disperse the rioters who had set fire to tires on the streets.

<HEAD>Britain To Send Diplomat To Iran For First Time In A Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain is to send a diplomat to Iran for the
first time in a year, the Foreign Office said today.
   A Foreign Office spokesman said David Reddaway, a first
secretary, will spend two to three weeks in Tehran to ``test the
water'' and will then report back.
   The announcement followed a marked improvement in relations
between Britain and Tehran over the past six weeks, raising hopes
that British hostages held by pro-Iranian captors in Lebanon might
be freed.
   Officials said Reddaway is expected to visit two Britons jailed
in Tehran, businessman Roger Cooper and a tourist, Nicholas Nicola.
   Last month, Britain and Iran reached a compensation agreement
for damage done in 1980 to each other's embassies and related
properties in London and Tehran.
   The Foreign Office said July 26 that relations were ``in a new
phase'' following Iran's acceptance of U.N. terms for a cease-fire
in the 8-year-old Persian Gulf War.
   Britain last summer recalled its diplomats, who worked out of
the Swedish Embassy in Tehran, and all but broke diplomatic
relations with Iran.
   The move came after a British diplomat was kidnapped and beaten
in apparent reprisal for the arrest by British police of an Iranian
envoy on shoplifting charges.
   The British Embassy was damaged by rioting mobs denouncing
Britain as a U.S. ally after the U.S. Embassy and American
diplomats had been seized. The Iranian eMbassy in London was
damaged during a siege by Iranians opposed to Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini.

   Assailants shot and killed two
men in a Roman Catholic district of Belfast today, police said.
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, accused Protestant
extremists of carrying out the attack.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's police force, said
the gunmen escaped in a car which was found abandoned in a nearby
Protestant area, Shankhill.
   Police said one of the men was killed while delivering beer to a
Catholic working men's club in the Ardoyne. The other was shot on
the street, they said.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Sinn Fein, the
outlawed Irish Republican Army's legal wing, accused Protestant
extremists of carrying out a random sectarian attack.
   The killings followed a series of IRA bombings and shootings in
Northern Ireland, Britain and West Germany which left six dead and
37 injured.
   The predominantly Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule
in Northern Ireland and unite the province with the Irish Republic.

<TEXT>
   Henri Frenay, a leader of the French Resistance
against Nazi occupation during World War II, has died at age 82,
family members said today.
   The family refused to give any details on the date or cause of
death.
   During the occupation, Frenay founded the Resistance group
Combat and the underground newspaper of the same name.
   Born Nov. 19, 1905, in Lyon, he was educated at France's
military academy, St. Cyr, was commissioned a second lieutenant in
1926, promoted to lieutenant in 1928 and captain in 1934.
   Frenay was a captain when the German army invaded France in May
1940. He was captured June 25, 1940, but escaped and returned to
Lyon where he began organizing the Resistance.
   He participated in the French government in exile in Algiers and
was named commissioner for prisoners and deportees. After the
liberation, Frenay served in the French provisional governments of
1944 and 1945 as minister for prisoners, deportees and refugees. He
was promoted to colonel in 1945.
   After the war, the resistance fighter managed a toy company.
   Frenay was author of ``The Night Will End,'' ``Volunteers of the
Night'' and ``The Jean Moulin Riddle.''
   His only son, Henri, said Mass would be celebrated in Paris' St.
Louis des Invalides church at a date to be announced. The church
commemorates France's military heroes and contains the tomb of
Napoleon.

   A housekeeper found a homemade bomb
that failed to explode under the car of a U.S. Air Force sergeant
near his home outside Clark Air Base, a base spokeswoman said today.
   Explosive experts defused the bomb after it was found early
Sunday under the car of Master Sgt. Francisco S. Calabia, Capt.
Maryellen Jadick said.
   A Filipino police officer, Cpl. Danilo Maniti, said the fuse of
the bomb apparently had been lit since it was partially burned, but
it ``must have been snuffed out by rain.''
   No suspect or motive have been found in the attempted bombing,
according to a statement issued by the base.
   The statement said Calabia told investigators he parked his
station wagon at 6:30 a.m. Saturday under a car port in an off-base
housing area.
   Calabia, whose hometown was not given, said he had not received
any warnings or threats, the statement added.
   The incident occurred at a time of heightened security near the
base.
   Communist rebels in October killed three Americans and a
Filipino outside Clark, which is located in Angeles city, about 50
miles north of Manila.
   More than 40 people have been killed in Angeles since May in
murders that police blame mostly on the rebels.
   An American soldier was shot and killed while jogging near his
home on July 25, but police said the airman's estranged Filipino
wife admitted plotting the killing to collect insurance.

<HEAD>Police Return Confiscated T-Shirt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police today returned, with apologies, a
T-shirt they confiscated from a teen-ager because it criticized
military censorship in Israel and angered a crowd of Israelis in a
bus station.
   Tamar Forman, 14, a daughter of U.S. immigrants, said she
planned to continue wearing the white shirt emblazoned in red with
``Freedom of the Press'' in Hebrew, Arabic and English, despite the
controversy it stirred.
   The shirt also bears a mock military censor's stamp and a
picture of a soldier gagging a man, whose hands are tied.
   A policewoman took the shirt from Miss Forman last month after
forcing her to remove it at Jerusalem's central bus station when an
angry crowd of 50 surrounded the girl, cursing her.
   Left-wing legislators said the incident underscored anti-press
feeling in Israel that has intensified during the 8-month-old
Palestinian uprising, in which 237 Arabs and four Israelis have
been killed.
   Miss Forman, who complained to police about the incident last
week, was questioned for 30 minutes today at Jerusalem police
headquarters.
   A policewoman then apologized for the confiscation and returned
the shirt.
   ``The lady said she was sorry and gave me the shirt,'' Miss
Forman said. ``I feel it's good something was done about this, and
I hope this means it won't happen to somebody else.''
   Her mother, Judy Forman, from Trenton, N.J., hugged her daughter
as they left the station and said she was shocked ``that such a
thing could happen to my daughter and in my country, the state of
Israel.''
   Miss Forman said she had worn the shirt several times to school
before the incident. ``I plan to wear it again,'' she added.
   But her father, David, an immigrant from Boston, interrupted to
say: ``Not in the central bus station.''

   One man was killed, five people were wounded and a Greyhound bus
was hit with bullets in five apparently random highway shootings in
Oregon and Colorado, authorities said.
   Jody Wayne Dixon, 28, was killed Sunday evening while he sat
inside a pickup truck in congested traffic on U.S. 26 about 10
miles west of Portland, Ore., police said.
   A second pickup truck raced to the head of the line, pulled in
front of waiting vehicles, got off the freeway and fired on the
traffic from the exit ramp, said Senior Trooper Norma Adamse.
   Earlier Sunday in Portland, a motorist opened fire on the car in
which Diana Harris, 19, was riding on Interstate 84, police said.
Ms. Harris was wounded in the foot and was in good condition at a
hospital, police spokesman Dave Simpson said.
   No arrests were made in the shootings, which police said were
not related.
   Colorado's first shooting occurred Sunday when a Greyhound bus
was hit with three bullets as it passed a van on Interstate 70 in
west-central Colorado. One woman suffered facial cuts from flying
glass. No arrests were made.
   A drive-by shooting on Interstate 70 in northeast Denver later
Sunday left Cung La, 17, in critical condition with a head wound
and his two passengers in good condition, said Denver General
nursing supervisor Pam Bourg. No arrests were made.
   One passenger told investigators their car cut off another car,
which then chased them, said patrolman Dan O'Shea.
   The third Colorado shooting apparently was the result of a
near-collision in Silverthorne, about 60 miles west of Denvert,
said police Lt. Bill Barnett.
   A man was arrested for allegedly shooting at a car carrying a
woman and her four children, Barnett said. No injuries were
reported.
   Last summer, highway shootings killed five people and injured at
least 20 in Southern California.

<HEAD>Tentative Settlement at Public Hospitals May Lead to Private
Sector Deals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICH CARTIERE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tentative agreement aimed at averting a
strike by 1,600 nurses at two public hospitals could lead to
settlements in three strikes involving nearly 4,000 private-sector
nurses, Mayor Art Agnos said.
   Local 790 of United Public Employees announced the tentative
agreement Sunday. Ratification would prevent 1,600 nurses from
striking San Francisco General, which handles the poorest and
sickest people in the city, and Laguna Honda Hospital, which cares
for elderly patients, and a half-dozen city clinics, including one
at a jail.
   ``We reached this settlement on time because none of the parties
wanted to add to the health care fears that have permeated this
city'' since the labor disputes began last month, Agnos said.
   ``I call on all the parties in the private-sector disputes to
take a lesson from the public sector here,'' the mayor said.
   Talks with Local 790 continued round-the-clock throughout the
weekend; the settlement was reached at 4:20 a.m. Sunday.
   Details of the pact were not released. The public-sector
division of Service Employees International Union sought to reduce
nurse-patient ratios and improve measures to retain and recruit
nurses.
   Pay was not an issue with the municipal nurses, but
private-sector nurses say increased pay is the main issue in their
strike.
   Agnos said he told his staff last week to try and settle the
dispute before Tuesday's strike deadline in order to prevent adding
to a labor crisis that so far involves eight private hospitals.
Nine hospitals have not been struck.
   Agnos also called for an immediate resumption of bargaining in
the strikes, in which no new talks have been scheduled. He said he
planned to ``very actively, very aggressively'' involve himself and
other city officials in the disputes.
   About 1,700 licensed vocational nurses and hospital workers in
Local 250 of the Hospital and Health Care Workers Union went on
strike July 26 against seven hospitals. More than 2,100 registered
nurses represented by the California Nurses Association struck at
six of those facilities on Aug. 2.
   On Saturday, 130 nurses represented by the CNA and an
undetermined number of service workers represented by Local 250
also went on strike at French Hospital.
   The struck hospitals have remained open.
   The strike by Local 250 is mainly over health benefits and sick
leave. The CNA wants an 11 percent raise for the first year and a
10 percent raise in the second year of a two-year contract.
   The hospitals are negotiating as a group called Affiliated
Hospitals and have offered 18 percent raises over 31 months, which
would cost the affected six hospitals $40 million. Talks with
French Hospital employees are separate from the other negotiations.

<TEXT>
   Today's 8-8-88 and residents of Eighty
Eight, the southwestern Kentucky town 8.8 miles south of Glasgow,
have gone eight-wild.
   The U.S. Postal Service has sent a mobile post office from
Louisville to help with today's once-in-a-century chance for the
special post mark.
   ABC's ``Good Morning, America'' broadcast a segment of today's
show from this small farming community of 150 residents.
   And, at 8:08 p.m., a couple from Casper, Wyo., plans to wed.
That's 8:08 on 8-8-88 in Eighty Eight.
   Legend has it that Eighty Eight was named by Dabnie Nunnally, a
postmaster in the 1860s. He wanted to give the town a digital name,
reached into his pocket, found 88 cents in change, and that was it.
   Much of the revelry began Sunday, when, in anticipation of the
date, residents and visitors clogged the town's only thoroughfare
to watch a parade, buy souvenirs and have a piece of a
commemorative cake _ 8 feet, 8 inches long, 8.8 inches wide and 8.8
inches high.
   The folks in Eighty Eight, though, were not the only ones
celebrating the once-in-a-century date. Throughout Southeast Asia,
Cantonese-speaking Chinese, who consider the number eight good luck
since it sounds like the word for prosperity in their language,
marked the day with weddings, business openings and lavish parties.
And some hospitals geared up for maternity ward gridlock as women
sought to bring their children into the world on the propitious day.
   It was also a special day for Sylvia Torgerson of Ferryville,
Wis., who came from a family of eight children and turned 88 years
old today. In addition to her 11 children, she has 88 descendants,
the family says.
   In Kentucky, there was even a special commemorative menu at the
Eighty Eight Market.
   ``I got a special 88-cent hamburger,'' said Pearl Russie of
DeKalb, Ill. ``Four cents tax makes 92, so there's 8 cents change.
Good.''
   Ms. Russie, 45, was among Sunday's early arrivals. She drove up
to the front steps of the market in her Oldsmobile. A Delta 88, of
course. Her license plate read ``ANY 88.''
   ``I'm an 88 freak,'' said Ms. Russie, a custodian at Northern
Illinois University.
   She had to buy a new set of tires to make the 500-mile trip,
but, ``when I heard there was a town called Eighty Eight, I had to
come here,'' she said.
   The most talked-about part of the celebration was tonight's
marriage of Tom Accardo and Deborah Muhlbeier.
   In its broadcast this morning from Eighty-Eight, ``Good Morning,
America'' interviewed eight people, including Accardo and Ms.
Muhlbeier.
   ``We're here because we wanted to get married in Eighty Eight,
Kentucky, on 8-8 of '88 at 8:08 p.m. ... on the eighth step of the
Refuge Church of Christ,'' Ms. Muhlbeier said.
   Accardo acknowledged he would have no excuse for forgetting his
wedding anniversary.
   The couple had not yet set a date when they learned of the town
located about 40 miles east of Bowling Green from a television news
report, and decided it would be fun to tie the knot there on 8-8-88.
   The couple tried to write the mayor of Eighty Eight, soon
learning there wasn't one, Accardo said. They heard instead from
Donnie Sue Bacon, the postmistress. Plans for an outdoor wedding,
performed by a county magistrate, soon took shape.
   ``It's fun. We won't ever have this happen again,'' said Ms.
Bacon, who this year has received numerous requests from around the
world for the postmark.

   President Reagan told the nation's governors
today that in his two terms in the White House he had kept his
promise to ``get the federal government off the backs of the
states.''
   Speaking to the 80th annual meeting of the National Governors
Association, the president said, ``In the last 7{ years, we have
broken the federal government of its compulsion to control every
breath the states take.''
   In his text, Reagan never mentioned the presidential contest
between his vice president, George Bush, and Democratic Gov.
Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts.
   Dukakis was not scheduled to appear at the governors conference
until the closing session on Tuesday. Bush was in New Orleans,
where the Republican National Convention will nominate him for
president next week.
   Reagan portrayed himself as a former governor who reversed a
trend toward federal domination of the states.
   ``Too often in the past, when Washington listened to the states,
it heard only what it wanted to hear,'' he said. ``Today, things
are different.
   When governors talk, we not only listen, but we hear.''
   The president said his administration had worked closely with
governors to come up with assistance for farmers hurt by the
widespread drought.
   ``You have advised,'' he said. ``We have responded. America's
farmers are getting help.''
   ``From education to transportation to helping America's poor and
homeless, you have led,'' he said. ``While Washington has been
caught up in partisan intrigue, you've gone out and done the job.''
   Reagan cited welfare reform as an area in which ``the states
will find the way truly to help welfare families become independent
and productive and to put them on the ladder of opportunity.''
   He contrasted state actions with what he called ``program after
program'' enacted by Congress to get people off welfare.
   ``All of those programs have had one thing in common,'' he said
of the federal efforts. ``They've failed.''
   The governors have fought Reagan's effort to shift
responsibility for welfare to the states. They argued that he was
giving them the problem without shifting the funds needed to deal
with it.
   Reagan recalled his days as governor of California when ``I was
sitting where you're sitting, and I was talking about the need to
get the federal government off the backs of the states. ...
   ``I hope that history will record that this former governor went
on to practice what he'd preached and to fight the use of federal
dollars first as bait, then as a club, and to return power and
responsibility to the states where they belong.''
   Earlier, the chairman of the governors association predicted
that Reagan's successor, Democrat or Republican, will turn more
federal power over to the states.
   ``I think both candidates understand there is a return of
authority and responsibility necessary to go back to the states,''
John Sununu, the Republican governor of New Hampshire, said on the
NBC-TV ``Today'' program.
   ``If we're going to be effective and efficient in health care
and education, some of the handcuffing of federal legislation has
to be removed,'' said Sununu, who appeared in the interview with
incoming association chairman Gerald Baliles of Virginia.
   By the time the governors hold their winter meeting in
Washington in 1989, a new president will be in the White House.
   Before the meeting began, Sununu, a strong Bush supporter, and
Baliles, agreed privately to lobby their colleagues to steer clear
of presidential politics during the conference.
   Throughout Reagan's first term and well into his second, the
governors were often at odds with the president over budget
priorities, with Reagan resisting their demands that he cut his
plans for increases in defense spending and that he consider a tax
increase as a means of reducing the budget deficit.
   They also clashed over the president's effort to transfer
responsibility for many domestic programs to the states.
   Even Democratic governors admitted that Reagan won that battle.
   ``Here we are, 7{ years later, not too far from perhaps where
the president first thought we ought to be,'' said Democratic Gov.
Richard Celeste of Ohio.

   NASA today rescheduled the crucial
hot-fire test of shuttle Discovery's engines for Wednesday morning
after replacing the defective valve-sensor combination that caused
a last-second scrub last week.
   The test, in which all three of the shuttle's engines are fired,
was set for 7:30 a.m. EDT. Technicians will begin the countdown for
the test at 6:10 p.m. Tuesday.
   The shuttle's engines were to have been tested last Thursday,
but the sensor reported that a one-inch valve which circulates
coolant before firing had not closed to where it was supposed to
be. The engines' onboard computer, sensing a malfunction, aborted
the test before ignition.
   Technicians spent the weekend swapping out the mechanism. Today,
the blast doors that protect the shuttle during the firing were
being installed and scaffolding removed.
   The engines will be fired for 22 seconds with the shuttle bolted
firmly to the pad. The ship's two solid fuel booster rockets will
not be ignited.
   The firing tests not only the engines, but the entire countdown
process, the shuttle system and launch teams. It is a requirement
since no shuttle has flown in the more than 2{ years since the
Challenger explosion. Dicovery is being treated as if it were an
untried new ship.
   No date has been set for Discovery's launch with five astronauts
on board, but five postponements of the hot-fire test to date have
made it all but certain that NASA can't meet a late September
target.
   The sensor, which signals the valve's open-closed position to
the ship's onboard computer, gave a wrong reading last Thursday,
and the flight readiness firing test was aborted. Engineers
determined that the valve was in the proper position but decided to
replace both because they are in the same subassembly.
   That work was finished by midnight Saturday; crews spent Sunday
reconnecting lines and hoses and testing everything for leaks.

<HEAD>Vincennes Rescues Five Iranian Fishermen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The USS Vincennes, the cruiser that mistakenly
shot down an Iranian airliner last month, rescued five Iranian
fishermen over the weekend who apparently had been drifting in a
dinghy for more than a week, defense officials said today.
   The officials, who asked not to be identified, said the
guided-missile cruiser was on a routine patrol in the Gulf of Oman,
just below the entrance to the Persian Gulf at the Strait of
Hormuz, when it spotted the five fishermen in a small dinghy on
Sunday.
   The men were quickly taken aboard and treated for what was
described as minor injuries, primarily dehydration and hypothermia,
the officials added.
   ``The five identified themselves as fishermen whose boat sank
while working in the Gulf of Oman,'' said one source. ``They had
apparently been adrift for several days, possibly up to eight
days.''
   The sources said the men were still aboard the Vincennes today,
awaiting arranfements to be made for a return to Iran.
   The Vincennes took up patrol duties just outside the Persian
Gulf not long after it accidently shot down an Iranian Air Bus on
July 3, killing all 290 aboard. The guided-missile cruiser had just
emerged from a battle with Iranian gunboats when its radar
operators detected what crew members thought was an Iranian F-14
fighter.
   According to a Pentagon report which has not been released
publicly, the stress of first-time combat contributed to crew
errors in tracking and targeting the ill-fated airliner.

   A racing boat apparently snagged debris during
a race before it flew out of control into a crowd of spectators
along the Allegheny River, injuring 23, authorities said.
   The 1,100-pound, 16-foot boat driven by Robert Wood suddenly
became airborne, veered sharply to the right and slammed into the
crowd near Three Rivers Stadium during Sunday's 11th annual Three
Rivers Regatta, which drew 100,000 people.
   Eleven of the injured were children.
   This morning, hospitals treating the victims reported three
people still in critical condition. One person originally counted
among the race accident victims was injured separately while diving
in the river, said a spokeswoman for one of the five hospitals that
treated the injured.
   Police spokeswoman Margaret Rizza said the injuries included
open fractures, abrasions and severe blunt injuries to the chest,
stomach and head.
   Wood, 23, of North Peterborough, Ontario, suffered minor
injuries and shock, said the race medical director, Barry Carras.
   The accident occurred in choppy water during the seventh lap of
the 50-lap Champion Spark Plug Grand Prix race.
   The 15-boat race, sponsored by the U.S. Formula One Racing
Association Inc., was the highlight of the regatta.
   Spectators lining the 1.2-mile course said the accident happened
so quickly they didn't immediately figure out what had happened.
   ``I was watching the lead boats going around, and I looked up
and saw (Wood's boat) headed right at us about 50 feet out,'' said
Patrick Heyden of Butler County.
   ``The front end lifted and it started coming toward us,'' said
Robert Surovchak, 21, of suburban Bethel Park. ``We had about 10 or
15 seconds to get out of the way, but some of the people didn't
realize what was going on and they got hit.''
   Surovchak was not hurt, but his girlfriend, Julie Saver, 19, of
Pittsburgh, who had been standing beside him, was hospitalized in
serious condition at Allegheny General.
   The race was restarted two hours later, after paramedics
transported the injured from Roberto Clemente Park to five
hospitals. The rest of the race was limited to 20 laps.
   Race officials said Wood's propeller apparently snagged some
debris and came off, causing the boat to lose control and spin
wildly into the crowd at a 90-degree angle. The boat landed on its
side with the engine toward the spectators.
   Another driver in the race, John Provich, 44, of Ambridge, said
authorities recovered a railroad tie from the river with propeller
marks on it. He speculated that Woods' boat hit the railroad tie.
   Police Lt. Leo O'Neill described the wood as ``a rather large
log.''
   ``It was just one of the pieces of debris that was pulled from
the river in that vicinity,'' O'Neill said. ``At this point the
investigation is very broad and we're looking into all aspects.''
   Police said they didn't know how long it would take detectives
and officials of the U.S. Coast Guard to complete the investigation.
   Witnesses said the boat's engines were off when it hit the
riverbank at about 40 mph. But race officials said they did not
know the boat's speed.
   Formula One boats, which have eight- and six-cylinder engines
and weigh up to 1,000 pounds, are the fastest outboard powered race
boats. Drivers can reach more than 140 mph on straightaways and 90
mph on turns.

   Thousands of young people marched
through Burma's capital today chanting anti-government slogans and
singing the national anthem, diplomats said. Students had called
for a nationwide general strike.
   Japan's Kyodo News Agency reported 30,000 people took part in
protests in Rangoon and more than 10,000 students, Buddhist monks
and others staged demonstrations in Mandalay, Burma's second
largest city.
   No violence was reported in what may have been the largest
protest in Burma since democracy was overthrown 26 years ago.
   ``You couldn't see the end of (the crowd),'' said Georgina
Allen, a 22-year-old British student who today returned to Bangkok
from Rangoon. She said she saw ``solid flanks'' of unarmed
demonstrators clenching their fists, cheering and clapping their
hands as they marched along a main street in Rangoon.
   ``We're going for democracy. We're fighting for democracy,'' she
quoted one student as saying.
   Allen said some Burmese students told her, ``We don't want to
change the government. We want a socialist government. We hate the
president. He's an evil man.''
   Many shops were closed and there were reports that some workers
stayed away from their factory jobs, but other stores were open for
business, said Western and Asian diplomats reached by telephone in
the capital, Rangoon.
   The extent of the strike was not immediately clear.
   The demonstrators, most of them wearing handkerchiefs around
their faces to avoid identification, walked in orderly fashion in
the downtown area and there was no confrontation with troops
patrolling the city, the diplomats said.
   They said they did not know whether protests took place in other
parts of the city or the surrounding area.
   Students have been at the forefront of protests against the
nation's new hard-line leader, Sein Lwin. They blame him for
ordering the suppression of demonstrations in Rangoon last March
and June in which, by unofficial count, more than 100 people were
killed.
   Last month, the former army general was named president of Burma
and chairman of its ruling party.
   The Chinese news agency Xinhua in Rangoon quoted official
newspapers as saying demonstrations broke out Saturday in Pegu,
Yenangyang and Thanatpin, with police opening fire to disperse
crowds.
   There were also unconfirmed reports reaching Bangkok that
students and Buddhist monks held weekend demonstrations in
Mandalay, Burma's second largest city.
   Authorities issued orders banning all public gatherings,
speech-making, marches and agitation in Pegu, Yenangyang and
Thanatpin. Martial law was clamped on Rangoon, the capital, on
Wednesday after demonstrators demanded Sein Lwin's ouster.
   The official Rangoon Radio, monitored in Bangkok, said Sunday
that authorities investigating recent disturbances found a list of
those ``who pulled the strings from behind-the-scenes'' and
released 80 people from Insein prison.
   It gave no further details of the alleged ringleaders pinpointed
by the authorities.
   The 80 said to have been released _ 11 students, 66 civilians
and three civil servants _ appeared to be among 149 people the
government said it arrested in connection with last week's
demonstrations.
   Before the demonstrations, authorities arrested a leading
government critic, former Brig. Gen. Aung Gyi, and several other
people, including Associated Press correspondent Sein Win.

   About 600 evacuees have returned home and
cleanup has begun in the aftermath of a train derailment in which
14 cars crashed into a diesel fuel tank that exploded and burned
for nine hours.
   A tank storing anhydrous ammonia was punctured in the Saturday
accident and leaked dangerous fumes, said Troy Fire Chief Gerald
Cherry.
   Several firefighters suffered minor injuries, but no injuries
were reported by residents or the train's crew.
   A preliminary investigation indicated a bearing apparently
burned off a wheel on one car, causing the derailment, said Brian
Sweeney, a spokesman for Burlington Northern Railroad.
   People who were forced to spend Saturday night in a church and
school near this eastern Missouri town were allowed back into their
homes about 11 a.m. Sunday.
   ``I'm worn out,'' said Virginia Metts, 77, who spent Saturday
night at a motel. ``If I'd known how long it would be, I would have
taken some needlepoint or something.''
   The train was traveling from Galesburg, Ill., to St. Louis.

   President Daniel Ortega left today on
a surprise visit to Panama for talks with officials of that
country's military-dominated regime, the newspaper Barricada said.
   Barricada, which is run by Ortega's leftist Sandinista National
Liberation Front, cited sources at the Information and Press
Ministry as saying that Ortega ``will hold talks at the highest
level with representatives of the Panamanian government.''
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, chief of Panama's Defense Force,
currently holds power in Panama. The United States has indicted him
on drug smuggling and money laundering charges and has imposed
economic sanctions on the country in an effort to oust Noriega.
   Barricada gave no details, but sources in Panama, who insisted
on anonymity, said Ortega was scheduled to arrive in Panama City at
midday.
   For security reasons, Nicaraguan government officials did not
disclose the Sandinista leader's schedule, saying only that Ortega
will travel to Ecuador on Wednesday to attend the inauguration of
President Rodrigo Borja.
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who is on a South
American tour, also is scheduled to attend the inauguration. State
Department officials said there were no plans for any meeting
between the two men.
   In Ecuador, the newspaper said, Ortega will ``officially
re-establish diplomatic relations between the two countries.''
Outgoing President Leon Febres Cordero of Ecuador broke diplomatic
ties in 1985, saying a statement Ortega had made was offensive.
   Borja invited Ortega to the inauguration and said one of his
first acts in office will be to re-establish relations with
Nicaragua.

<HEAD>Oregon Fire Grows Overnight, Authorities Considering Evacuations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A fast-moving forest fire in Oregon grew by more than half
overnight to 11,000 acres, while cooler temperatures and higher
humidity helped firefighters in Yellowstone National Park halt the
spread of wildfires there.
   Authorities were considering whether to evacuate a popular
tourist area 25 miles southeast of Bend, Ore., because of the fire
in Deschutes National Forest. The fire continued to burn out of
control this morning despite the efforts of more than 1,000
firefighters.
   The Paulina fire, pushed by winds and low humidity, consumed
4,000 acres of mostly dead lodgepole pine overnight, officials said.
   Laurie Johnson, a U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman, said it was
possible the fire could reach the rim of Newberry Crater today.
   ``If this should happen, spot fires might start within the
crater near East and Paulina lakes,'' Johnson said. ``There's no
reason to panic. The fire is still a ways away.''
   Smoke from the human-caused blaze could be seen as far away as
Idaho.
   ``We've had columns (of smoke) up to three miles high,'' Johnson
said.
   At Yellowstone, some 1,000 firefighters halted the movement of a
19,600-acre blaze toward a religious settlement.
   ``The fires have slowed down,'' park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo
said this morning. ``I know we did not see significant increase in
acreage (overnight), and all the fires continue to be contained
within the park boundaries.''
   Much of the smoke that has billowed from the fires since late
June has begun to lift, unveiling acres and acres of green trees
that somehow managed to survive flames, she said.
   While some 180,000 acres of the 2.2 million-acre park have been
affected by the fires, Anzelmo said once all the smoke clears, the
stands of untouched trees will reduce the number of acres actually
charred.
   On the Fan fire burning in Yellowstone's northwestern corner,
firefighters managed to stop the northern movement of the fire and
keep it out of southern Montana property owned by the Church
Universal and Triumphant.
   Church officials have threatened to sue the National Park
Service if the blaze, which has stalled for several days at about a
quarter-mile from the Yellowstone border, crosses onto their land.
Last week, week church members stood before the flames and prayed
in an attempt to redirect the fire.
   In Idaho, crews continued to mop up the hot spots inside the
fire line on the 1,500-acre Spring Canyon II fire.
   ``We're hoping the weather will stay cool and humidity will stay
up for the next few days,'' spokeman Gary Cornell said.
   Firefighters contained the blaze, which is burning in the
Targhee National Forest near the Wyoming border, Saturday evening.
Officials said they hope to have the fire under control by tonight.

<DATELINE>CRATER LAKE, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists' first dives to the bottom
of Crater Lake turned up no signs of expected hot springs that
might be evidence of ancient volcanic activity, but their submarine
ride gave them a new outlook.
   ``I think so far we have seen similar things, but in much
greater detail than last year,'' when a robot submarine explored
the lake, Oregon State University oceanographer Jack Dymond said
Sunday, describing the first two dives.
   ``We haven't found any actual thermal springs,'' said Dymond,
who made the first manned dive to the bottom of the nation's
deepest lake Friday. The deepest point in the lake is 1,932 feet.
   Dymond and fellow OSU oceanographer Robert Collier are using a
one-man submersible called Deep Rover to search the lake for hot
springs that may be the remnants of volcanic activity that formed
the lake.
   Dymond said he saw what he interpreted as evidence of old hot
springs: deposits of iron and manganese and rock formations with
colored stains on holes or cracks.
   The research could affect efforts by California Energy Co. to
develop hydrothermal energy nearby, outside the boundary of Crater
Lake National Park. If the lake is found to have significant
geothermal features, development in the neighboring Winema National
Forest could be prohibited.
   The two men are in the second year of a three-year effort
financed by the National Park Service to learn why the lake's water
is so clear, with visibility measured to depths of 85 to 115 feet.
   Collier, who made his first dive Saturday, said that at a depth
of 1,200 feet blue light was still visible from above.
   Their work is part of a larger 10-year study started after
scientists in the 1970s noticed a significant reduction in the
lake's clarity. Recent measurements have shown the clarity
returning to levels last measured in the 1930s.
   Dymond and Collier said nothing they have found so far could
settle the question of whether drilling for hydrothermal energy
more than seven miles away would affect the lake.
   California Energy Co. geologist Joe LaFleur said if hot springs
do exist, they wouldn't be affected by the drilling.
   Crater Lake was formed after rain and melted snow filled a
crater, called a caldera, formed when the Mount Mazama volcano
erupted nearly 7,000 years ago and then collapsed into what had
been a chamber filled with molten rock.
   Collier and Dymond said sonar echos off unexpectedly craggy
features on the bottom of the lake made precise navigation
difficult.
   Precise navigation is important. Last year, while using the
remote-controlled submersible, scientists found what looked like a
vent oozing a milky fluid. However, they were never able to
relocate it to take a temperature reading or a fluid sample.

   A vehicle struck a camel on a

linking the Red Sea town of Al-Lith with Mecca in western Saudi
Arabia.
   Saudi Arabia's superhighways usually are safeguarded from
wandering animals by fences, but herdsmen who want to move their
beasts from one side of the road to the other sometimes cut holes
in the barriers to avoid traveling out of their way.

   The government today declared an
immediate cease-fire in the 13-year Angolan war and set Nov. 1 as
the date it plans to begin pulling out of neighboring South-West
Africa.
   However, Foreign Minister Pik Botha said further negotiations
are necessary to determine a timetable for withdrawal of Cuban
troops from Angola and the granting of independence to South-West
Africa, also known as Namibia.
   ``This is the first step of a very long, arduous road to
peace,'' Botha told a news conference.
   Cuba, Angola and the United States also were expected to issue
statements today following last week's fifth round of U.S.-mediated
peace talks.
   Botha said South Africa planned to pull its estimated 3,000
troops out of Angola by Sept. 1.
   South Africa, along with the United States, backs the UNITA
rebel movement in its 13-year-old fight against the Angolan
government. Angola is backed by an estimated 50,000 Cuban troops.
   South Africa has an estimated 50,000 troops in Namibia, and
Botha said withdrawal would begin Nov. 1. But he said the countries
involved must first agree on a single date for the total withdrawal
of Cuban troops from Angola and independence for Namibia.
   The parties plan a sixth round of talks the week of Aug. 22 to
try to resolve the matter. The site of the talks was not announced.
   South Africa has said it will grant Namibia independence next
June 1 if all Cuban forces have left Angola by that date. Cuba,
however, has offered in previous talks to withdraw over four years.
   Today's announcement suggested the two sides were closer to
agreeing on a mutual date than at any time previously.
   Botha said South Africa had invited U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar to South Africa to discuss Namibian
independence.
   ``It's imperative that the secretary general visit South Africa
urgently,'' Botha said.
   The peace talks began in London in May. In the fifth round, held
last week in Geneva, negotiators reportedly agreed on a cease-fire
between South African and Cuban-Angolan forces as well as a mutual
pullback of troops. Details of the agreement were withheld.
   The parties have reached no public agreement on the role of
UNITA, SWAPO or the African National Congress, the main black group
fighting white rule in South Africa. South Africa has called for
the dismantling of seven guerrilla camps it says are operated in
Angola by the outlawed ANC.
   South Africa's mandate over Namibia was terminated by the United
Nations in 1966, but it has retained control over the territory in
defiance of several Security Council resolutions.
   The state-run South African Broadcasting Corp., in a commentary
today, described the current diplomatic climate as ``one that would
hardly have been conceivable just a few months ago.''
   However, it said major problems remained unresolved in regard to
implementation of the U.N. plan for elections in Namibia.
   ``The very substantial costs associated with the plan have
caught some of the parties unawares,'' the report said. ``Apart
from the $600 million needed for organizing U.N.-sponsored
elections, guarantees will have to be found for replacing the $120
million (in) annual economic aid ... that South Africa has borne
until now.''

   Graffito at a Lower East Side park entrance
reads ``Go Home Yuppie Scum.'' But neighbors say reasons for a riot
that pitted hundreds against police reach beyond tensions created
by gentrification and include drug-dealing and homelessness.
   Thirty-eight people, including seven police officers, were
slightly injured in confrontations early Sunday at Tompkins Square
Park; nine were arrested on riot, assault and disorderly conduct
charges, authorities said.
   Six brutality complaints were filed against police, who were
wearing riot gear and were bolstered by mounted officers and
helicopters.
   ``I hope you saw what ... was going on because we didn't start
this,'' said Police Capt. Gerald McNamara. ``We did everything in
our power not to provoke an incident. They didn't charge the crowd
until the bricks and bottles started flying.''
   The riot started as police tried to enforce a 1 a.m. curfew at
the Manhattan park. Some residents had asked that police do so,
saying the park is a nighttime hangout for drug dealers, rowdy
drunks, homeless people and so-called punk rockers, who dress in
black leather and spike their hair.
   At a City Hall news conference this morning, Koch blamed
Sunday's riot both on tempers that flared in the heat and on
``provocateurs.''
   On Sunday, Koch said the curfew at Tompkins Square would be
suspended for the duration of the current heat wave. Today, Koch
said the city will enforce a curfew at two city parks _ Washington
Square and Stuyvesant Park _ where he said residents favor 11 p.m.
closings.
   Neither Koch nor Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward, who appeared
with Koch, said they could conclude whether police used undue
force. Citizens' complaints about extreme use of force will be
investigated, Ward said.
   Aides to Koch handed out photocopies of flyers said to have been
distributed by demonstrators. One warned landlords near Tompkins
Park that if the curfew were enforced ``our organization will
destroy your homes''; another was bordered with drawings of guns
and explosives. Koch called them the work of ``provocateurs,'' and
Ward suggested they were drawn up by ``professional demonstrators.''
   Protesters, bystanders and reporters and photographers
complained of random attacks by police with billy clubs. Police
complained they were pelted with rocks, bottles and sticks.
Firecrackers exploded and at least one fire was set.
   Estimates of the crowd ranged from around 100 to the Police
Department's official estimate of more than 700. The police force
started at about 100 and swelled to 450.
   ``Police were calling people scum, twirling their nightsticks.
And the kids were inciting them, too, but they weren't throwing
bottles or anything,'' said Dan Kelley, 26, who lives in the
neighborhood also known as the East Village.
   The riot started as police attempted to enforce a 1 a.m. curfew
that applies to all city parks but is rarely enforced. Police said
residents had complained that they were having trouble sleeping
because of noise from the park.
   ``It's noisy, there's rampant drug dealing, drug use, all night
revelry,'' said Kim Yarbrough, 41, who lives nearby. ``And the
place looks like a dump.''
   ``It makes it difficult for people to sleep,'' said Phillip
Glazel, 38. ``I've heard lots of complaints from old-timers.''
   Some park habitues, however, saw the police effort as part of a
vague conspiracy of developers and city officials who want to rid
the area the poor, punk-rockers and squatters, and make it more
attractive to affluent whites.
   ``It's being totally gentrified, taken over by the
upper-middle-white-rich class,'' said Mike Huckelberry, 18, a
squatter in a nearby abandoned building.
   ``That's yuppie-bashing,'' said Lee Kelly, who attributed the
clash to hot weather and frustrated police who panicked.
   ``You'll talk to 50 people and get 50 explanations,'' she said.
``But the fact is nothing's happening.''
   The decision to enforce the curfew was made July 11, and an
informal coalition of residents, homeless people, punk rockers and
self-styled revolutionaries held at least two protests during the
past month. Police cleared the park but allowed the homeless to
sleep in one corner.
   On Saturday evening, anticipating a large demonstration, police
turned out in force. At 11:15, about 250 demonstrators marched
around the park, with police standing by while firecrackers were
thrown, McNamara said.
   As the demonstration continued, blocking traffic, officers were
hit with flying debris, he said. McNamara ordered officers on foot
to form a phalanx, led by mounted officers, which charged the crowd
at about 1 a.m.
   ``The crowd went nuts,'' Kelley said. ``Horses were charging in
a sense and then bottles started flying. People started getting hit
by billy clubs. I ran across the street. I was really afraid of
getting trampled.''
   The crowd was dispersed, but bottle- and rock-throwing
skirmishes continued until dawn at several places around the park.
   ``An entire neighborhood was terrorized,'' said Sharon Breslau,
who has lived a half block from the park for the past eight years.
``There was no time for `What? Where? Excuse me, what's your badge
number?' It was a riot.''

   George Bush criticized the Democrats'
platform as ``a document of deceit'' today and suggested there
still may be a chance that he and President Reagan will appear
together at the Republican National Convention next week.
   Initial plans called for Reagan to leave New Orleans before Bush
returns next Tuesday. However, the vice president told reporters on
Air Force II that he would view such a joint appearance as a plus
for his campaign.
   Bush, trying to put his stamp on the GOP platform, flew to the
Republicans' convention city today to call for ``a statement of
solutions'' that he said would cotrast with the invisible policies
of rival Michael Dukakis.
   ``He's the stealth candidate,'' the vice president said in
prepared remarks. ``For while he can't decide about the stealth
bomber, he favors instead stealth policies _ they can be neither
seen nor heard.''
   ``His campaign jets from place to place, but no issues show up
on the radar screen.''
   Besides testifying before the platform committee, Bush was also
to tour the Superdome, where he will be formally nominated next
week as his party's presidential candidate.
   ``Their nominee spoke for 50 minutes in Atlanta and failed to
mention the most important issue of our time: how to make the world
a safer place,'' Bush said.
   ``We need to make this campaign a plan for the future, a
statement of solutions, not an exercise in evasion,'' he said. ``We
should make our principles and our policies crystal clear to the
American people.''
   Bush ran through a litany of positions he had espoused during
his campaign, suggesting their inclusion in the platform.
   These ranged from tax credits for child care to a ban on
offshore dumping, a reduction in the capital gains tax and
imposition of the death penalty for drug kingpins.
   ``If we want to stop our kids from putting drugs in their veins,
they must first have good ideas in their heads and moral character
in their hearts,'' he said.
   On Sunday, Bush spoke with reporters on the grounds of St. Ann's
Episcopal Church in Kennebunkport, Maine, after attending services
with 22 members of his family: his wife, Barbara; his 87-year-old
mother, Dorothy; his five adult children, their spouses and his 10
grandchildren.
   The Bush clan, which occupied the two front pews of the small
oceanfront church, later posed for family photographs outside and
taped television commercials for the fall campaign.
   Bush denied accusations from the Dukakis campaign that he was
shying away from debates.
   ``Not only do I want debates, but I have to because I've got to
get him to stand by his record,'' Bush said.``We've got to spell
these differences out and debates are a good way to do it,'' he
said.
   But Bush was vague on when _ and how often _ he would be willing
to debate Dukakis.
   ``There'll be more than one debate, but how many ... has not
been sorted out yet,'' he said.
   Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich said Bush was only making
a display of bravado for the television cameras and should agree to
debate Sept. 14 in Annapolis, the first of three dates set by a
bipartisan commission.
   Dukakis campaign officials have criticized Bush for refusing to
commit himself to the schedule of debates set by the advisory
commission.
   ``It's time to dock the motorboat in Kennebunkport and launch
the debate in Annapolis,'' Estrich said Sunday.
   Meanwhile, Bush's designated campaign chairman, Treasury
Secretary James A. Baker III, suggested Bush might further distance
himself from positions embraced by the Reagan administration once
he is formally nominated.
   Baker, who is resigning his Cabinet post next week, said Bush
already has started to develop his ``own individual persona.''
   ``He will be seen in an entirely different light once he is his
party's nominee, a bit more free to speak out, speak his own mind,
and speak out on issues distinct and different from the
administration,'' Baker said on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press.''
   Baker also said he did not view Bush's campaign as troubled _
despite low ratings in recent public opinion polls.
   ``But I would agree there are a large number of unfavorables out
there,'' Baker said.
   He suggested the gap corresponded to the ``disapproval rating of
the administration, of the president'' and that it would narrow as
the election approaches.

<HEAD>Team Begins Unloading Toxic Waste From Syrian Ship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENOA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Experts began work Monday to unload from a
Syrian ship 12,000 drums of a toxic substance that shippers have
been trying to dispose of for more than a year.
   Several rusty, leaking drums from the freighter Zanoobia were
being put into larger containers while experts began tests on the
waste, said Giuseppe Francese, head of the Genoa port.
   Unloading the drums will take from two to three months, he said.
   The Zanoobia brought the waste back to Italy two months ago
after foreign countries refused to accept it.
   The Italian state-controlled company Castalia, which won a $6
million contract to dispose of the waste, did not make public the
final destination of the unidentified toxic material, although port
sources said the material may be sent abroad to be incinerated.
   The waste, produced by Italian firms, was returned to Italy
after unsuccessful attempts to dump it in Djibouti, Venezuela and
Syria.

<HEAD>Forecasters Eyeing Tropical Depression Over Southeast Louisiana</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with noon EDT position on Beryl, Alberto

<BYLINE>By JAMES MARTINEZ</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Tropical storm Beryl, the second named storm of the
Atlantic hurricane season, hugged the Louisiana coast today,
forcing evacuations from oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, while the
season's first tropical storm fizzled out near the Canadian coast.
   Beryl was upgraded today from a tropical depression after its
winds strengthened, reaching close to 45 mph with gusts up to 55
mph. The storm strengthened as it drifted closer to the warm waters
of the Gulf of Mexico. Oil companies evacuated more than 2,000
workers from oil rigs in southern Louisiana and the Gulf.
   The tropical storm had a center near latitude 29.5 north and
longitude 89.3 west. It was drifting southeastward at less than 5
mph, and its movement was expected to be slow and erratic through
Tuesday. The storm's center was about 50 miles southeast of New
Orleans.
   ``There is some likelihood it could strengthen,'' said Mark
Zimmer of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. ``It's not
drifting inland, it's drifting away from land, but very slowly.''
   Zimmer said the immediate danger from Beryl was to shipping and
oil rigs along the Gulf coast. People on the coast, he said, should
watch for tides of up to three feet above normal.
   Tropical storm warnings were in effect from Morgan City, La., to
Pensacola, Fla., and small craft from Port O'Connor, Texas,
eastward to Appalachicola, Fla., should remain in port, the center
said.
   ``Right now we're advising people to listen to their radios and
watch television,'' said Andy Valence, mayor of Grand Isle, La.,
about 40 miles south of New Orleans in the Gulf of Mexico.
   ``It's highly unusual for depressions to form over land. Most of
the time they get their start way out in the middle of the ocean,''
said Jim Gross, a forecaster at the National Hurricane Center in
Miami. ``We don't have a lot of experience with systems that form
this way.''
   A tropical weather system becomes a named storm when its winds
hit 39 mph, and a hurricane when wind velocity reaches 74 mph.
   The storm chiefly affected those out on oil rigs in the Gulf,
the weather service said.
   Chevron spokesman Jonathan Lifa said about 2,000 workers were
being evacuated early today. All employees at facilities at Venice
and Leesville in Plaquemines Parish were evacuated by boat and
helicopter, while non-essential personnel were removed from a
facility at Morgan City.
   Lifa said the storm became more threatening as it neared the
gulf.
   ``News reports (over the weekend) were that the center was
partially onshore and partially offshore, so we didn't have high
winds to worry about,'' Lifa said. ``The concern is that the more
it gets into the gulf, the more winds pick up. It is something we
are very concerned about.''
   Texaco spokesman Max Hebert said an unknown number of workers
were taken off Texaco rigs in the Gulf of Mexico today.
   Coast Guard Petty Officer First Class Bob Morehead said the
Coast Guard has not carried out any evacuations, but the storm's
winds buffeted helicopters and created choppy seas for its ships.
   The storm didn't appear to affect Republicans gathering in New
Orleans for their national convention next week; about 2 percent,
or 105, of the delegates have arrived to serve on various
pre-convention panels and committees, said Connie Thumma,
co-director of media operations for the convention.
   ``Better this week than next week,'' said Bill Phillips, the
convention manager.
   The storm was unlikely to have any effect on today's visit by
Vice President George Bush, who landed in New Orleans this morning
for an appearance at GOP platform sessions, said Phillips. Bush
also planned a stop at the Superdome, site of the convention.
   ``Right now New Orleans is mostly getting the weaker western
side of the storm. The folks that have been getting the worst of it
are those south of New Orleans,'' said meteorologist Mike Koziara.
   Meanwhile Alberto, the season's first named storm, fizzled out
today off the Canadian coast, Zimmer said.
   ``It's lost its tropical characteristics,'' he said. ``Now it's
just a storm.'' The center will no longer issue bulletins on it, he
said.
   Shortly after noon Sunday, the forecasters had issued a tropical
storm warning for Maine's coast from Bar Harbor to Eastport, but
they canceled it less than six hours later.
   The storm was most likely to make landfall at Yarmouth, Halifax
or Eddy Point, Nova Scotia, forecasters said.
   Typically, there are 10 named storms during the six-month
hurricane season, which begins June 1. Last year, there were only
three hurricanes and four tropical storms in the Atlantic.

   George Bush flew to the Republican'
convention city a week early today to put his stamp on a party
platform he said would be a sharp contrast to the Democrats'
``exercise in evasion.''
   Aboard Air Force II, on his way to New Orleans from his Maine
home in Kennebunkport, Bush also suggested there still may be a
chance that he and President Reagan will appear together at the
Republican National Convention next week.
   Previously announced plans called for Reagan to leave New
Orleans before Bush returns next Tuesday. However, the vice
president told reporters that he would view such a joint appearance
as a plus for his campaign.
   Bush attacked Dukakis as ``unexperienced'' and therefore a risky
bet as president in remarks Sunday. Dukakis' campaign countered
that Bush's lengthy government ``resume didn't help him when it
mattered.''
   Reagan spoke in Cincinnati today to the National Governors
Association, declaring, ``While Washington has been caught up in
partisan intrigue, you've gone out and done the job.''
   In his remarks prepared for delivery to the governors, Reagan
never mentioned the presidential campaign. He said that during his
two terms in the White House he had kept his promise to ``get the
federal government off the backs of the states.''
   Bush, in remarks prepared for his unusual appearance before the
Republican Platform Committee today, called Dukakis ``the stealth
candidate.''
   ``For while he can't decide about the stealth bomber, he favors
instead stealth policies _ they can be neither seen nor heard. His
campaign jets from place to place, but no issues show up on the
radar screen.''
   Bush called the Democratic platform a ``document of deceit'' and
urged GOP drafters to be more specific.
   ``We need to make this campaign a plan for the future, a
statement of solutions, not an exercise in evasion,'' he said. ``We
should make our principles and our policies crystal clear to the
American people.''
   Bush also was to tour the Superdome where he will be nominated
next week.
   The GOP platform, free of controversy within the party, will
highlight differences with the Democrats.
   ``I think the country is entitled to know the specifics,'' Bush
said Sunday after going to church near his home in Kennebunkport,
Maine. ``The governor of Massachusetts says he is a liberal, says
he is a card-carrying member of the ACLU (the American Civil
Liberties Union), and that didn't come out of the convention.''
   Bush even added new heat to his attacks on Dukakis' foreign
policy experience.
   ``We can't risk the peace and national security of this country
on someone as unexperienced as the governor of Massachusetts,'' the
GOP nominee-to-be said.
   Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich responded by saying Bush
supported arms sales to the Iranians in the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``The vice president's resume didn't help him when it
mattered,'' she said. ``He sat silently by while the administration
peddled arms to the Ayatollah.''
   Presidential politics was the topic in private discussions at
the National Governors' Association meeting, where Dukakis was to
speak on Tuesday. But the chief executives agreed to avoid public
partisanship.
   Republican Gov. John Sununu of New Hampshire, a vigorous Dukakis
critic, promised Sunday to keep the campaign out of the meeting.
   Dukakis, just returned from a three-day campaign swing, needled
Bush for not accepting a debate plan put forth by the two political
parties. The GOP nominee-to-be said the question was not whether to
debate, but when and who will sponsor the confrontations that have
become a staple of presidential campaigns.
   ``There'll be more than one debate, but how many ... has not
been sorted out yet,'' Bush said. ``Not only do I want debates, but
I have to because I've got to get him to stand by his record.''
   The Democratic campaign is ready to talk debate specifics, but
Bush has said those conversations cannot begin until he formally
becomes the Republican nominee at next week's convention.
   Bush ``is talking tough to the cameras but is refusing to meet
Mike Dukakis in a face-to-face debate,'' Estrich said. ``If George
Bush wants to debate foreign policy, Mike Dukakis is ready.''
   Bush, with a unified party behind him but trailing badly in the
polls, moved today to take the spotlight for the next two weeks,
coming to the Republicans' convention city seven days before the
opening gavel to talk to the platform committee.
   The Democrats have ``had their day in sun,'' he said. ``Now we
will have our day.''
   Bush vowed to draw distinctions with the Democrats and their
short platform that spoke of themes and goals and mentioned few
specific programs.
   ``They masked it. They cramped down any discussion of individual
initiatives,'' Bush said. ``Mine will be somewhat more specific.''
   From the Democratic side came the warning that the Republican
platform will be full of phrases that sound acceptable to moderate
voters, but which promise nothing.
   ``They'll say `We're for human rights in South Africa, but we're
not going to oppose apartheid,''' said Rep. William Gray III of
Pennsylvania, who chaired the Democratic platform drafting
committee.
   Bush campaign chairman-to-be James Baker said the next two weeks
will mark a watershed for Bush.
   ``He will be seen in an entirely different light once he is his
party's nominee, a bit more free to speak out, speak his own mind,
and speak out on issues distinct and different from the
administration,'' said Baker, who will step down as Reagan's
Treasury secretary at the end of the GOP convention.

<HEAD>Scientists Announce Discovery of Distant Galaxy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Astronomers have discovered a galaxy 15 billion
light years from Earth, one of the most distant galaxies ever seen,
it was announced today by the Space Telescope Science Institute.
   The galaxy, named 4C41.17, was discovered by scientists using a
new search strategy they developed. It was located because of the
enormous power and peculiar spectrum of its radio emissions.
   The galaxy is more than 90 percent of the distance to the
visible limits of the universe, the announcement said.
   The discovery was made by Ken Chambers, a graduate student at
Johns Hopkins University and George Miley, professor of astronomy
at Leiden University in the Netherlands, who was stationed at the
telescope science institute in Baltimore by the European Space
Agency. They made their observations with Wil van Breugel, an
astronomer at the University of California-Berkeley.
   Extremely distant galaxies are of great interest to astronomers.
Because light from them takes billions of years to reach the Earth,
remote galaxies can be used to provide data about the early stages
of the universe. The record distance of the new galaxy means it is
being seen only about a few billion years after the Big Bang, which
scientists believe marked the beginning of the observable universe.
   The announcement was made in Baltimore at the General Assembly
of the International Astronomical Union.

   The U.S. Navy cruiser that mistakenly shot
down an Iranian airliner last month rescued five Iranian fishermen
who had been adrift at sea for more than a week, the Pentagon said
Monday.
   The USS Vincennes spotted the five men drifting in a small
dinghy around 9 p.m. EDT Sunday in the Gulf of Oman, said Lt. Col.
Keith Schneider, a Pentagon spokesman.
   At the time, the Vincennes was on a routine patrol in the Gulf
of Oman just below the entrance to the Persian Gulf at the Strait
of Hormuz, Schneider added.
   ``Their fishing boat had reportedly sunk eight days before and
they were afloat in a small dinghy,'' the spokesman said.
   ``The fishermen were dehydrated and suffered from hypothermia
and body rash. The USS Vincennes administered emergency medical
care and is currently holding them on board until arrangements can
be made for their safe return.''
   Schneider said the five men had in their possession ``a ship's
registration that provided certain information about the fishing
vessel and crew.''
   The spokesman declined to predict when the men would depart,
saying, ``Their return is being handled through diplomatic
channels.''
   The Vincennes took up patrol duties just outside the Persian
Gulf not long after it accidently shot down an Iranian Airbus on
July 3, killing all 290 aboard.
   The guided-missile cruiser had just emerged from a battle with
Iranian gunboats when its radar operators detected what they
thought was an Iranian F-14 fighter. According to a still-secret
Pentagon report, the stress of first-time combat contributed to
crew errors in tracking and targeting the airliner.

<HEAD>Thousands of Vagrants Warned or Arrested in Byelorussia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>

   Authorities in the Soviet republic of Byelorussia
have arrested or given official warnings for vagrancy to more than
40,000 people in the past four years, a newspaper report said.
   The report in Saturday's Sovietskaya Byelorussia, received
Monday in Moscow, said more than half of the people arrested for
vagrancy had held jobs but either were fired or quit voluntarily
when they started wandering.
   The newspaper added that many others had lost families and homes
while imprisoned and are faced with a suspicious society that does
not want to give them a second chance.
   ``Being isolated from society, many of them lose their families,
their residence permits, homes, and when they return work
collectives often do not wish to accept them and recognize them as
first-class citizens,'' the report said.
   Soviet media have begun paying more attention to social problems
such as homelessness and vagrancy in the more open atmosphere
created by Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost.
   The numbers cited by Sovietskaya Byelorussia _ 8,000 arrests and
35,000 warnings _ were surprisingly large for the republic of 10
million people. There was no indication how they might compare with
figures in other areas of the Soviet Union.
   The Soviet Union guarantees a job and a place to live for all of
its citizens, and proclaims that as one of the benefits of the
Soviet system.
   The newspaper said many of the vagrants turn to theft of
government or personal property.
   More than 80 percent of the vagrants are men, the newspaper
said. Three- quarters of the men and half of the women are under
30. Half have a high school education, but every sixth vagrant has
specialized high school or technical training, it said.

   George Bush, trying to put his stamp on the
Republican Party platform, told drafters today it should include
``a statement of solutions'' in contrast to what he said were the
invisible policies of rival Michael Dukakis.
   ``He's the stealth candidate,'' the vice president said in
prepared remarks. ``For while he can't decide about the stealth
bomber, he favors instead stealth policies _ they can be neither
seen nor heard.''
   ``His campaign jets from place to place, but no issues show up
on the radar screen.''
   Bush told the platform committee, ``We need to make this
campaign a plan for the future, a statement of solutions, not an
exercise in evasion. We should make our principles and our policies
crystal clear to the American people.''
   He listed positions he had espoused during his campaign and
suggested they be included in the platform.
   These ranged from tax credits for child care to a ban on
offshore dumping, a reduction in the capital gains tax and the
death penalty for drug kingpins.
   Before Bush's arrival, the platform committee heard testimony
from witnesses including Contra leader Adolfo Calero who urged the
party to renew its pledge of support for the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Other witnesses, including anti-ERA activist Phyllis Schlafly
and the chairman of Ford Motor Co., lined up today to press their
views on the committee, but the spotlight was on Bush, the man who
will carry the party's standard in the election.
   ``We're just very excited by the fact that he is coming to New
Orleans and appear before (us),'' Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr, chairwoman
of the platform committee, said Sunday.
   Orr and Sen. Bob Kasten of Wisconsin, a co-chairman of the
panel, told reporters they expect there will be no minority planks
in the 1988 platform, continuing a pattern established in 1980 and
1984.
   Bush traveled here from his summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine,
to make an unusual personal appeal to the platform writers, meeting
a week in advance of the Republican National Convention.
   Today, Contra leader Calero told the committee the rebels could
revive their dispersed army of 17,000 and bring down the Sandinista
government within a year ``if we receive the proper support.'' He
said afterward the rebels need $100 million in new U.S. aid.
   He told reporters Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis, an adamant
opponent of Contra aid, ``doesn't understand the Sandinistas
apparently. He doesn't understand the threat they represent.''
   Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, one of the crafters of the
Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law, told a platform panel
subcommittee on the economy, ``If the American people knew the
Dukakis record clearly, he would not be elected.''
   He urged adoption of a four-point plan that includes allowing
Social Security recipients to work without penalty, providing
child-care dividends, lowering the capital gains tax and giving tax
breaks to families with college-bound children.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah told a family subcommittee that the
Democratic plan for child care ``would throw money from the top
down, a Washington bureaucratic approach.'' He urged adoption of a
Republican proposal for child care tax credits, which would be
``putting back money in the pockets of the American family.''
   Kasten, co-chairman of the platform committee, said in an
interview, ``Generally speaking, I sense we're not likely to
revisit in great detail some of the debates we had in '80 and '84
on ERA and abortion.''
   He said, however, that ``the potential for genuine controversy
and division among us exists on ... day care, education, drugs,
handicapped, AIDS _ issues that we didn't thoroughly hash out and
digest in '80 and '84.''
   Republican leaders have said they expect their 1988 platform to
follow the same conservative lines that the GOP established in 1980
and 1984 for the Reagan-Bush ticket, with some new emphasis on
child care, drugs and other emergent domestic issues.
   Bush told reporters Sunday in Maine he would urge his fellow
Republicans to ``be a little more specific than the Democratic
platform committee,'' which produced that party's most general
platform in half a century.
   ``I think the country is entitled to know the specifics,'' said
Bush, who claimed that the Democrats had masked their own and
Dukakis' liberalism.
   The subcommittees _ on the economy, education, family,
agriculture, energy and environment, foreign policy and defense _
will spend Tuesday drafting their planks, which the full committee
will hammer out in sessions over the rest of the week.
   There is no doubt the party will repeat its anti-tax increase
pledge from 1984 and other tenets of the Reagan-Bush administration.
   The 1984 Republican platform opposed any tax hikes and was
silent on the Equal Rights Amendment. It endorsed proposed
constitutional amendments requiring a balanced federal budget and
empowering the president with the line-item veto.
   The GOP platform committee has been gathering testimony around
the country since the end of March.
   The committee will formally vote on the platform it drafts next
Monday, then present it the next day to the full convention for
approval.

   Soviet inspectors arrived Monday to
visit a cruise missile base and a repair shop to check compliance
with the superpower treaty to remove ground-launched medium-range
nuclear missiles from Europe.
   U.S. officials said the 20 Soviets on Tuesday will visit
Florennes air base, 40 miles south of here and a Belgian plant, 10
miles north of Florennes, which the United States uses as a repair
and maintenance shop for its European-based cruise missiles.
   U.S. officials said the United States has deployed 20 cruise
missiles at Florennes and 55 cruise missiles and their launch
canisters are at the plant at Gosselies which belongs to Sabca, an
aviation construction company.
   The Soviet inspectors, led by Viacheslav S. Lyebedev, arrived at
Brussels' Abelag airport and were welcomed by Belgian officials;
U.S. Air Force Col. John Fer, head of the On-Site Inspection
Agency's European field office at Rhein-Main Air Base in West
Germany; and his deputy, U.S. Army Lt. Col Scott G. Lang.
   Under the U.S.-Soviet accord, the United States and the Soviet
Union will remove all ground-launched nuclear missiles with a range
of between 300 and 3,400 miles.
   The treaty, which removes an entire class of nuclear arms, said
Lyebedev, ``marks the beginning of an unprecedented stage in the
history of mankind.''
   ``We will perform our duties in strict compliance with the
provisions of the treaty,'' said Lyebedev, speaking through an
interpreter.
   Fer said the inspections ``are serious business. It is a task we
accept with commitment.''
   In recent weeks, Soviet inspectors have visited U.S. missile
sites and related installations in Britain, West Germany, the
Netherlands and the United States. Italy is the only European
nation not yet visited by Soviet inspectors.
   U.S. inspectors have already visited sites in the Soviet Union,
East Germany and Czechoslovakia.
   The Florennes air base houses the 485th U.S. Tactical Missile
Wing. Under NATO's 1979 decision to deploy 572 cruise and
Pershing-2 missiles in the five European nations, 48 cruise
missiles were to be based at Florennes.
   The repair plant at Gosselies belongs to the Belgian firm of
Sabca, a Belgiasn aviation construction firm, and does maintenance
and control checks on unarmed missiles from Belgium, West Germany,
Britain, Italy and the Netherlands.
   Under the treaty, the United States and the Soviet Union agreed
to remove hundreds of ground-launched medium- and shorter-range
missiles in a three-year period and not to produce or test such
weapons after that. The treaty also gives each party on-site
inspection rights for 13 years.
   The treaty covers U.S. cruise, Pershing-1A and Pershing-2
missiles and Soviet SS-20, SS-4, SS-5, SS-12 and SS-23 missiles.

<TEXT>
   A nephew of the late President Jomo
Kenyatta pleaded guilty Monday to plotting to overthrow the
government, and he was sentenced to six years in jail.
   Andrew Kibathi Muigai entered the plea before Chief Magistrate
Joseph Mango during a 20-minute proceeding.
   Muigai is the brother of former Assistant Minister of Health
Ngengi Muigai. Their father, James Muigai, was the brother of Jomo
Kenyatta, Kenya's first president who died in 1978.
   Andrew Muigai, 35, was accused of being a member of Mwakenya, a
Marxist underground group trying to bring down the government of
President Daniel arap Moi.
   More than 80 people, including journalists, civil servants and
university lecturers and students, have been jailed after admitting
links with the group. Human rights groups such as Amnesty
International claim the confessions are coerced.
   Mwakenya is a Swahili acronym for the Union of Nationalists to
Liberate Kenya. The group says in its literature that its aim is to
bring down Moi's capitalist government and to redistribute the
wealth.
   Muigai admitted he had held a secret meeting with exiled
politician Koigi wa Wamwere, a former member of Parliament who fled
Kenya for Norway in 1986 and is a frequent critic of the Moi
government. Muigai said his meeting with Wamwere occurred Jan. 25
at the town of Namanga on the Kenya-Tanzania border.

   More than 100 seals died in the
coastal waters of the northern West German state of
Schleswig-Holstein over the weekend, officials said Monday.
   That raises the number of seals who have died from a mysterious
virus in Schleswig-Holstein coastal waters to 2,098, said a
spokesman for the state's Environment Ministry.
   Thousands of other seals suffering from the virus have died off
the coasts of the Netherlands and Scandinavia.
   From Friday through Sunday, 134 seal bodies were found on
Schleswig-Hostein beaches, the Environment Ministry spokesman said.
   The virus struck North Sea seals earlier this year. West German
environmentalists blame it on waste from industry, but scientists
say they do not really know what has caused it.

   All classes at the University of
the Western Cape have been suspended this week following
confrontations linked to student demands for the ouster of a law
lecturer, a school official said.
   The step was announced Sunday night by Jakes Gerwel, chief
administrator of the predominantly mixed-race university, after
meetings with senior administrators and faculty.
   Last week, a group of students barged into the office of the law
school dean to demand the ouster of a junior lecturer who
purportedly was considered unhelpful to first-year students.
   Subsequently, students at a meeting voted to launch a
campus-wide class boycott, and there were reports that some
students disregarding the boycott call were assaulted.
   Gerwel said classes were being suspended this week ``to give the
university time to reflect.''
   Western Cape, with an enrollment of about 11,000, has evolved
into South Africa's most militant university. The administration
and faculty, as well as the student body, are active opponents of
apartheid, the government's policy of racial separation.

   Strong currents and muddy waters hampered
efforts Monday to find the bodies of more than 400 people missing
and presumed dead after a ferry capsized on the Ganges River, a
rescue official said.
   It was India's worst boat disaster, according to the United News
of India news agency.
   Only 23 bodies were found by Monday, officials and witnesses
said, including seven that were swept as far as 15 miles downstream
by the waters of the flood-swollen river at Katihar, about 650
miles east of New Delhi.
   About 100 people swam to safety or were rescued by villagers
after the 35-year-old ferry overturned Saturday when it hit a sand
bar while crossing the river.
   Most of the passengers were pilgrims crossing the river Hindus
consider sacred on their way to a shrine in the town of Deoghar.
   ``Now it is becoming clear that some 400 people must have died
in the accident,'' said Jyoti Prasad Mullick, vice chairman of the
local municipal board.
   Indian Navy divers Monday made their first attempt to reach the
boat, which is resting in water up to 30 feet deep. But the divers
were slowed by strong currents and muddy water, said H.S. Pathak,
head of the diving team.
   Katihar Commissioner Madan Mohan Singh said authorities plan to
break open the submerged two-deck ferry to retrieve the bodies.
   Soldiers on a boat used long bamboo poles to try to poke the
bodies out of the vessel.
   About 5,000 villagers and relatives of missing passengers Monday
gathered in drizzling rain on the banks of the Ganges to watch the
operation, according to Katihar Police Inspector N. Kumar.
   The ferry had a capacity to carry about 160 people, but 535
tickets were sold for the trip, according to dockworkers, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   ``It was badly overcrowded,'' said an official, who requested
anonymity. ``Many lives could have been saved if the ferry had
carried water safety equipment such as life jackets.''
   Survivors said they protested when 150 bags of wheat were loaded
on the vessel, which began wavering and capsized about 100 yards
from shore.
   Boat accidents are common in India during the annual monsoon
rains when major rivers overflow their banks.
   At least 150 people died on July 5, 1970, when a boat capsized
in Krishna River in eastern India.

   In Casteau, Belgium, meanwhile, NATO said about 250,000

   NATO's military wing, Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe,
said the soldiers will take part in 20 exercises as part of the
Autumn Forge series.
   The operations range from Bar Frost near the Arctic Circle to
maneuvers throughout the Mediterranean, it said.
   The statement said 17,000 troops from the United States' 1st
Infantry Division at Fort Riley, Kan., will take part in the annual
Reforger _ Return of Forces to Germany _ exercise.
   The U.S. soldiers, the statement said, will join nearly 100,000
troops in a field training maneuver called Certain Challenge in
southern Germany.

   ``We may finally see an end to that long and bloody war,''
Reagan said.
   ``Although this is only a first step in an affirmation of a

and the staying power in the gulf as well as in the Security
Council when it comes to serving peace,'' said Reagan.
   ``I applaud and encourage the efforts of Secretary General Perez
de Cuellar in bringing an end to this struggle,'' he concluded.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parents of a young woman strangled in
Central Park charged in a $25 million lawsuit Monday that a tavern
owner used her killer to lure underage girls to his bar.
   Steven and Ellen Levin charged that Dorrian's Red Hand, owned by
Jack Dorrian, was a ``cesspool of corruption.''
   They alleged that Dorrian served Robert Chambers alcohol on Aug.
26, 1986, the morning he killed their daughter, Jennifer, even
though he was too young to drink.
   They charged that Dorrian served Chambers ``as part and parcel
of a scheme or plan ... to parade Chambers as a decoy and an
enticement for the patronage of his social group and those of
approximately similar age, and more particularly, of the feminine
portion thereof.''
   Chambers, 21, is serving a five- to 15-year sentence for killing
Miss Levin. He pleaded guilty March 25 to first-degree manslaughter
while a jury was deliberating murder charges against him following
his two-month murder trial.
   Chambers strangled Miss Levin, 18, and left her nearly naked and
battered body sprawled beneath a crabapple tree behind the
Metropolitan Museum of Art. A bicyclist discovered the body.
   During the trial, Dorrian put up his $700,000 home to secure a
total of $157,500 bail for Chambers. He said he did it because he
felt sorry for Chambers' mother, Phyllis.
   The Levins' suit, which names Dorrian, his wife Carol, and the
restaurant-bar, charges the defendants were ``negligent, careless
and reckless'' in ``making possible and causing'' the conduct that
led to Miss Levin's death.
   Dorrian called the Levin's allegations ``absolutely
ridiculous.'' He has said that recent legal action against him has
been vindictive because he helped the Chambers family after Miss
Levin was killed.
   Dorrian's liquor license was suspended for two 10-day periods in
1988 for serving alcohol to underage patrons.
   In July, the Levins filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against
Chambers for the wrongful death of their daughter. Their lawyer,
Harry Lipsig, said the lawsuit would hang like a ``Sword of
Damocles'' over Chambers if he should ever come into any money.

   Contra leader Adolfo Calero, seeking a
renewed pledge of support from the Republican Party, said Monday
that Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis doesn't understand the
Nicaraguan Sandinistas and ``the threat they represent.''
   ``He doesn't understand that they are bent on not only
subjecting the Nicaraguan people but to expanding their revolution
throughout Central America. Otherwise he wouldn't be speaking the
way he has,'' the Nicaraguan rebel leader said after addressing the
Republican Platform Committee.
   On the other side, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega says he
found Dukakis' acceptance speech at the Democratic National
Convention inspiring and believes the Sandinista government ``can
trust Dukakis' administrative ability and the administrative
ability of a future Democratic administration to change U.S.
policy.''
   Ortega, quoted in the August issue of Forbes magazine, said, ``I
think that with Dukakis we could have better conditions to work for
a new dialogue. However, I think Mr. Dukakis will doubtless
encounter some serious obstacles; he will be subjected to
McCarthyist pressures from the die-hard conservatives.''
   In New Orleans today, Contra leader Calero made his negative
comments about Dukakis after asking a GOP platform committee to
renew the party's support of the Nicaraguan rebels.
   The platform, to be presented to the convention next week, is
expected to include language similar the party's 1984 statement of
support for the Contras.
   During his testimony, Calero avoided referring specifically to
Dukakis, saying only that many Americans seem to lack understanding
about the situation in his homeland.
   Questioned later by reporters, however, Calero said of Dukakis,
who opposes aid to the Contras, ``He doesn't understand the
Sandinistas apparently. He does not understand the threat they
represent.''
   Calero, one of seven directors of the Nicaraguan Resistance,
said if Congress would give ``proper support'' the Contras could
bring down the Sandinista government in a year. He said Sandinista
soldiers would defect and the Contras could not only revive their
dispersed forces of 17,000, but double their numbers in a few
months.
   Critics see that outlook as overly optimistic, not only because
of the uphill congressional battle for funds but in light of recent
in-fighting among the Contra factions and defection of the southern
fighting faction from the larger force.
   Calero said a repeat of the $100 million in military and
humanitarian aid approved in 1986 could turn the tide for the
weakened Contras and pressure the Sandinistas back to a serious
negotiating posture.
   Senate Republicans and Democrats are pondering a resumption of
military aid to the Contras, but the figures under consideration
generally are much lower.
   Without the aid, Calero told the platform hearing, ``the chances
are very dim'' for peace negotiations to resume.
   He told the platform committee that the Contras are committed to
peace through negotiation, although the rebel leaders have rejected
Sandinista proposals to resume peace talks that broke off June 9
without agreement. In late June, the Nicaraguan government offered
to have talks in Miami but the Contras said the talks should be in
a Central American country.
   In Congress, an aid package proposed by Senate Democratic leader
Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, was considered Monday by Senate
Republicans.
   It would allow release of $16 million in military aid this fall
if President Reagan certified that the Nicaraguan government had
disrupted the peace and stability of Central America.
   Calero termed the $27 million humanitarian aid package currently
proposed by Senate leaders _ with the $16 million in stockpiled
military supplies releaseable by separate presidential and
congressional approval _ ``totally inadequate.''

   Jean Porter Dubos, a microbiologist, co-author
with her husband of a classic history of tuberculosis and a
collaborator on his 1969 Pulitzer Prize-winning book of
non-fiction, has died. She was 70.
   Mrs. Dubos died Saturday at her apartment, Rockefeller
University announced Monday. Her family said she had suffered from
ovarian cancer for 2{ years. She had been undergoing chemotherapy
treatment.
   Letha Jean Porter, born Jan. 1, 1918, in Upper Sandusky, Ohio,
and known as Jean, began her career as a laboratory assistant in
the Dubos Laboratory of Comparative Pathology and Tropical Medicine
at Harvard Medical School in 1942.
   She then returned with Rene Jules Dubos in 1944 to what was then
Rockefeller Institute, where they established a laboratory to study
tuberculosis. She became his second wife in 1946. He died in 1982.
   They wrote ``The White Plague _ Tuberculosis, Man and Society,''
considered a classic about the history of tuberculosis. The 1950
book, reprinted last year, stresses social reform rather than
surgical intervention or chemotherapy to control disease.
   She was a collaborator on ``So Human An Animal: How We Are
Shaped by Surroundings and Events,'' which won her husband a
Pulitzer for general non-fiction in 1969.
   Funeral services are scheduled Thursday in Manhattan.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of Burmese marched in
Rangoon and 14 other cities Monday to protest the government of
President Sein Lwin, and eight people were killed, diplomats and
official media reported.
   Rangoon radio, monitored in Bangkok, reported ``mass
demonstrations'' in areas ranging from Moulmein on the southern
coast to Taunggyi in the wild, mountainous area of the Shan states.
   It reported ``violent incidents'' in Mandalay, 370 miles north
of Rangoon, and Mergui on the southern coast, with four people
killed and 12 wounded by security forces in each city. No violence
was reported in Rangoon.
   Newspapers in Rangoon reported weekend demonstrations in Pegu,
Thanatpin and Yenangyaung, and said police opened fire to disperse
crowds. At least five people were reported killed and several
wounded.
   Japan's Kyodo News Agency reported from Rangoon that 30,000
people marched and demonstrated in the capital Monday and more than
10,000 students, Buddhist monks and citizens went into the streets
of Mandalay, Burma's second-largest city.
   ``It was learned that the security forces used louspeakers
requesting demonstrators to disperse and completely avoided using
their weapons to impose control'' in Rangoon, the radio said.
   In a detailed account rare for Burma's official media, the radio
said protesters in Rangoon marched and chanted slogans,
congregating both in the heart of the city and in outlying areas.
Up to 4,000 were said to have been involved in one demonstration.
   The radio said 62 people had been arrested for looting or
``agitation'' since Sunday.
   Student activists spread pamphlets urging the overthrow of Sein
Lwin and had called for a nationwide general strike Monday. Rangoon
residents said the date was chosen because eight is an auspicious
number and Monday was the eighth day of the eighth month of 1988.
   Many stores were reported closed, but it was difficult for
diplomats in Rangoon to determine how many factory workers, civil
servants and others stayed away from work there and in other parts
of the country.
   Returning tourists said taxi drivers demanded twice the normal
rate for rides and U.S. dollars were in great demand.
   Foreign journalists have followed developments by telephone and
by monitoring official media because of restrictions on travel to
Rangoon, the only legal entry point for most outsiders. Foreign
reporters usually entered the country in the past on tourist vbisas
issued at Burmese embassies.
   Days after his election late last month, Sein Lwin ordered the
arrests of the most outspoken critic of the authoritarian
government, former Brig. Gen. Aung Gyi, other dissidents and
Associated Press correspondent Sein Win.
   The International Federation of Newspaper Publishers in Paris
said it had sent a telegram to Sein Lwin asking for ``assurances
that this distinguished newsman is not being detained for
exercising any of his human rights, including those of freedom of
expression and free journalistic activity.''
   Sein Win, 66, received the federation's Golden Pen of Freedom
award in 1963.
   Martial law was declared in Rangoon last Wednesday after
demonstrators marched through the city demanding the ouster of Sein
Lwin, a former general who became president and head of the
government party when Ne Win resigned after 26 years in power.
   In Bangkok, visiting Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain
said her government could do little to encourage democracy and a
more liberal economic system in Burma, a former British colony.
   ``I don't think that there is anything we can do,'' she told a
news conference. ``It's a problem that Burma will have to solve
herself. ... She's a very independent country.''
   Virtually every major city and town in Burma has been the site
of anti-government demonstrations since last fall.
   Rangoon radio said Sunday authorities investigating recent
disturbances had found a list of those ``who pulled the strings
from behind the scenes,'' but gave no details.
   It also said 80 people detained at Insein prison had been freed.
Those released _ 11 students, 66 other civilians and three civil
servants _ appeared to be those among 149 reported arrested last
week.
   Students have led the protest against Sein Lwin, whom they blame
for the bloody suppression of demonstrations in Rangoon during
March and June.

   NASA officials said Monday that a
new valve had tested out satisfactorily in the space shuttle
Discovery's engine compartment and they rescheduled the ship's
oft-postponed main engine test firing for Wednesday.
   The countdown for the test will begin at 6:10 p.m. EDT Tuesday.
The 22-second engine firing is set for 7:30 a.m.
   The engine test was halted Thursday in the last second when a
sensor reported that a valve had not closed as it was supposed to.
Engineers determined that the sensor, not the valve, was
malfunctioning but decided to replace both parts as a unit.
   That required erecting scaffolding, removing extensive plumbing
and wiring and gaining access to the crowded engine compartment.
The changeout was completed by midnight Saturday. The work of
reconnecting and testing all parts and removing the work platforms
was being completed Monday.
   ``Work on changing the hydrogen fuel bleed valve in Discovery's
number two main engine went better than expected over the
weekend,'' the space agency announced Monday, in setting the new
test date.
   ``The recovery from the problem on Thursday shows that the team
is working smoothly and I am expecting an on-time engine firing on
Wednesday morning,'' said Hugh Harris, a spokesman for NASA's
Kennedy Space Center.
   All three of Discovery's engines will be fired, using only a
portion of the half million gallons of fuel in the external tank,
while the shuttle remains bolted to the launch pad. The two solid
fuel rocket boosters flanking the shuttle tank will not be ignited.
   In the past, a flight readiness firing has been required only
for new shuttles, except for one time when a malfunction made a
retest necessary. But the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration is treating Discovery as an untried ship because of
the long time since the last flight and the many changes made since
the Challenger disaster.
   Challenger exploded 73 seconds after launch on Jan. 28, 1986,
with the loss of seven lives and there have been no American manned
missions since then. A leak in Challenger's right booster was
blamed for the accident. The boosters have been redesigned to
prevent a recurrence.
   Discovery's test-firing has been postponed five times for
various malfunctions, including leaks in ground equipment and last
wee's abort.
   No date has been set for Discovery's four-day flight with five
astronauts aboard, but the delays have made it all but certain that
NASA can't meet a late September target.

<HEAD>Thousands of Soviet Jews Visiting Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Soviet Jews are getting a
first-hand look at Israel after a 21-year travel ban to the Jewish
state. Some say they don't like what they see, while others dream
of staying forever.
   About 2,000 Soviet Jews are in Israel visiting their immigrant
relatives, according to Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. Hundreds
more arrive each month.
   Until this year, relatives of the more than 200,000 Soviet Jews
who emigrated to Israel have been permitted only telephone or
letter contact, and family visits were forbidden.
   Although diplomatic ties cut by the Kremlin to protest Israel's
1967 seizure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip have not been renewed,
recent changes in the Soviet political climate have made tourism
possible for those Jews who have relatives in Israel.
   The visitors are permitted to stay up to two months and are
restricted to bringing about $10 a day out of the Soviet Union.
   Airfare and visa charges amount to about $3,000, a large sum for
Soviets who on average make about $285 a month.
   A Foreign Ministry official said the visits were ``a very
positive trend'' and were accompanied by the arrival of a Soviet
consular delegation in Israel last year and the departure of a
similar Israeli mission to Moscow last month.
   Israeli officials hope the visits will help boost Soviet Jewish
emigration to Israel, which reached a record low last month.
   While Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union attained an
eight-year high of 1,639 in July, during the first seven months of
1988 only about 12 percent of 16,178 emigrants decided to settle in
Israel.
   To boost emigration, the Jewish Agency's Russian Department has
begun organizing free promotional tours that include seminars on
Israel's history and culture. Officials say the funding is
unlimited.
   ``We've turned into a travel agency,'' one official said as he
added the name of another Soviet Jew requesting a tour to a long
list of visitors on his desk. ``The phones never stop ringing.''
   Mina Helman of Riga said the tour had given her a glimpse of
``the astonishing Jerusalem, the lively Tel Aviv and the beautiful
Negev desert.''
   But some Soviet Jews said their time in Israel had revealed
problems in finding jobs and housing, as well as a constant state
of tension with Israel's Arab neighbors.
   ``I have spent 10 days in Israel and now I don't know if I want
to settle here,'' said a middle-aged man who said he was a
``refusenik'' _ a Soviet Jew denied an emigration permit.
   Chaim Finkelstein, 60, a construction worker from Kishinev, said
his visit convinced him that ``Israeli politics are ugly.''
   ``You have too many (political) parties. There must be a limit
somewhere and too much democracy can be harmful,'' he told the
daily newspaper Yediot Ahronot.
   Some Soviet Jewish immigrants in Israel agreed their countrymen
would be better off settling elsewhere.
   ``It's a crime to encourage people to come here. The absorption
system is a disaster,'' said Vika Ladizhinsky, whose father, Yefim,
a well-known immigrant painter, hanged himself in 1982 because he
failed to get the reception in Israel he had expected.
   Some Soviet Jews said the visits had strengthened their desire
to live in Israel.
   Marina, a Moscow teacher in her 40s who declined to give her
last name, said the Israel she saw during a 40-day visit was
markedly different from the hostile picture portrayed in the
official Soviet media.
   ``I thought people were being killed in the streets of Israel,''
she said of Soviet coverage of the 8-month-old Palestinian
rebellion in the Israeli-occupied territories. ``I'll tell all my
friends to come to Israel immediately.''
   Berta, 66, a gynecologist on a two-week visit with her sister,
said she wanted to settle in Israel with her husband, and was using
the visit to find out about job opportunities and pensions.
   Most of the Soviet visitors praised Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
reforms, saying they had greatly simplified the procedure for
getting exit visas.
   One middle-aged Leningrad woman, her relatives said, was
``reborn,'' by her trip. The woman sat on a bench, silently
embracing her mother and sister.
   ``She cannot talk,'' the mother said. ``She is too distressed.
She goes back in two days.''

   Sporting a ``Where was George?'' button and
flashing a broad smile, former U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan left a
hospital Monday, more than a week after she nearly drowned in her
swimming pool.
   ``Thank you for my life,'' Ms. Jordan, 52, told emergency
medical personnel and nurses who cared for her during her stay at
Brackenridge Hospital.
   Dr. William Deaton said Ms. Jordan is ``in excellent condition,
and she should return to her normal lifestyle within a couple of
weeks.''
   There is no explanation of what caused Ms. Jordan to lose
consciousness in her pool on July 30, Deaton said. He said it was
most likely a heart rhythm disturbance.
   The ``Where was George'' button refers to a Democratic National
Convention speech by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., that criticized
Vice President George Bush's role in the Reagan administration.

   Haid said he fell into the water while trying to attach himself

   ``I was hooking on, my hook slipped and I went off the back,''

   Actor LeVar Burton attributes his downfall
after ``Roots'' to money, drugs and women, but says meditation is
responsible for his comeback.
   Burton, who played the African slave boy Kunta Kinte in
``Roots,'' recently landed a part on ``Star Trek: The New
Generation.''
   ``I lost my balance,'' Burton said in an interview for an
article to appear in TV Guide's Aug. 13 edition. ``It turned my
world upside down and it took me a long time to find myself again.''
   Burton, 31, said he began psychotherapy just over three years
ago. He developed an interest in spiritualism and began meditating,
practiced ``Rolfing,'' a process of strenuous body manipulation,
breathing, fire-walking and even ``leaped blindfolded off a 30-foot
pole as a way of challening his fear,'' the article said.
   As he began to piece his life back together, Burton said he
decided to use spiritualism to will himself back into a good acting
job.

   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz
narrowly escaped an assassination attempt today when a bomb
exploded near his motorcade. A window of his wife's car was
shattered, but she was not injured.
   The government blamed the attack on Shultz's motorcade _ and
another bombing today at the U.S. commissary in La Paz _ on cocaine
traffickers. No injuries were reported in either bombing, although
the entrance to the commissary building was damaged.
   The bomb attack on Shultz's motorcade occurred on the outskirts
of the Bolivian capital as the secretary of state and his party
were driving in from the airport. The bomb blew a hole in the road
and scattered chunks of pavement over a wide area.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said in Washington
that windows were smashed or tires blown on three cars in the
motorcade. She said Shultz's wife, Helena, was in the first car
that was damaged, medical personnel were in the second and State
Department spokesman Charles Redman was in the third. Shultz and
his wife were in separate cars.
   Ms. Oakley said Shultz was proceeding with his schedule as
planned.
   ``If people are hoping for some sort of interruption in our drug
interdiction efforts, that is not in the cards,'' Redman told
reporters at a briefing in La Paz. He said he was paraphrasing
Shultz.
   The explosion occurred seconds after Shultz's car passed over
the road but before all 11 cars in the official motorcade had gone
by. The explosion occurred between the sixth and seventh vehicle.
   The blast was seen by this reporter from a vantage point a few
cars behind the official motorcade.
   
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombings,
but Foreign Minister Guillermo Bedregal said both were the work of
cocaine dealers. U.S. cooperation with government efforts to stem
the thriving cocaine trade has fueled anti-American sentiment in
Bolivia.
   After the highway blast, dozens of police officers closed the
road and climbed a nearby hill to search for the bombers. They
found a wire they said had denotated the bomb by remote control.
   Shultz, 67, was riding in one of the first few cars of the
motorcade. Riding in his car was Bolivia's foreign minister and
U.S. Embassy charge d'affaires David Greenley. A police escort
accompanied the motorcade.
   The secretary of state had been scheduled to go the Sheraton
Hotel in La Paz but instead was rushed directly to the U.S. Embassy.
   Shultz has been secretary of state since 1982. He has traveled
widely abroad during that time, but has never before been attacked.
   In La Paz, Shultz was expected to praise the government's
efforts in fighting cocaine production and smuggling. The
government crackdown, and U.S. cooperation, has angered drug barons
here as well as peasants, many of whom depend on the coca crop for
their livelihood.
   Shultz is on a 10-day, nine-country Latin American tour aimed at
gaining support for the Reagan administration's policies. He flew
to Bolivia today from Brazil. He began his tour Aug. 1 in Guatemala
City. The trip was scheduled to end Wednesday in Ecuador.

   Residents made a big stink when the
machine Wisconsin Power and Light Co. uses to add odor to natural
gas broke.
   The utility was flooded with hundreds of telephone calls Sunday
from customers who thought there had been a gas leak.
   Natural gas has no odor and one is regularly added so that a
leak, which can result in an explosion if gas builds up, can be
detected.
   WPL spokesman Don Piepenburg said the machine, which normally
adds the odor a little at a time, dumped it all at once.
   He said the machine was shut down and utility representatives
went door-to-door to assure residents there was no leak or danger.

<HEAD>Two Catholics Killed In Suspected Protestant Revenge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gunmen firing from a car shot
and killed two Roman Catholics on Monday in a suspected revenge
slaying by Protestants for a new round of Irish Republican Army
attacks.
   The gunmen escaped after the killings in the Catholic Ardoyne
area of north Belfast and abandoned their car in the Protestant
Shankill district, about two miles away, police said.
   Police sources and moderate Catholic leaders blamed the attack
on Protestant extremists taking random revenge for a series of IRA
bombings and shootings in Northern Ireland, Britain and West
Germany, which left six dead and 37 injured last week.
   Witnesses said the assailants pumped bullets from a machine gun
into Seamus Morris, who was standing with friends on a street
corner. The killers sped off into a side road as the 17-year-old
fell dying from head and stomach wounds, the witnesses said.
   In the side street, the car was confronted by a Guinness truck
delivering beer to a club. The gunmen fired a burst through the
windscreen, hitting the driver's assistant in the head and chest,
witnesses said.
   The wounded man was rushed to north Belfast's Mater Hospital,
where he died 30 minutes later, hospital authorities said. The
youth was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.
   ``It is clear that loyalist (Protestant) gunmen think they can
retaliate on innocent workers for the cold-blooded murders of last
week,'' said Brian Feeney, a local councilor of the main moderate
Catholic party, the Social Democratic and Labor Party.
   Sinn Fein, political front of the outlawed IRA, also blamed
Protestant gunmen, but said the attack was not in revenge for the
IRA's latest campaign of violence against British rule.
   ``There is no logic behind the retaliation theory,'' said Gerry
McGuigan, Sinn Fein councilor for Ardoyne.
   Police sources said suspicion fell on the Ulster Volunteer Force
which, like the mainly Catholic IRA, is an outlawed guerrilla
movement. It was the first attack for more than a month by
Protestant extremists.
   The killings, in broad daylight in a shopping district, took
place as police chiefs and Protestant political leaders met to try
to devise new security measures against the IRA.
   The IRA, preparing for next year's 20th anniversary of the
deployment of British troops to stop sectarian feuding, has said
its new campaign is aimed at British military targets.
   Last week's attacks included bombing British army barracks in
London and West Germany, killing two elderly Protestants on
temporary maintenance work at a police station, and dragging a
part-time soldier from a store and killing him in front of his
family.
   Also on Monday, a British soldier, Cpl. Alex Bannister, 21, who
was shot and wounded in Catholic West Belfast three weeks ago, died
of his injuries, the Defense Ministry said.
   The three deaths brought to 1,840 the number of people killed
violently in Northern Ireland since sectarian violence flared in
1969 and Britain sent in troops.
   The IRA is fighting a bomb-and-bullet campaign to end British

   Americans in more than 7,200 towns were set
to turn on porch and house lights Tuesday night in the fifth annual
``National Night Out Against Crime.''
   Vice President George Bush will switch on a giant light bulb in
downtown Philadelphia at 8 p.m. to kick off the symbolic message to
criminals that people intend to fight for safe neighborhoods.
   The annual anti-crime effort is organized each year by the
Pennsylvania-based National Town Watch Association. Its goals are
to heighten crime prevention awareness, generate support for local
anti-crime efforts, strengthen neighborhood spirit and promote
cooperation with law enforcement agencies.
   ``The event turns the clock back about 30 years to a time when
neighbors routinely kept an eye out for each other, kids played
outside until well after sunset and people knew the cop on the
beat,'' said Matt Peskin of Wynnewood, national project coordinator.
   Organizers of the national effort said lights will go on this
year in all 50 states, in all the U.S. terrorities, and in hundreds
of U.S. military bases around the world.
   After people join in the turn-on, also depicted this year as a
turn-off on drugs, they can go outside to visit with neighbors and
police as well as participate in block parties, cookouts, parades
and other activities.
   Electric industry officials estimate that leaving a couple of
lights on all night for a year would cost the average homeowner
about $30.
   Among events Tuesday night:
   In Dayton, Ohio, the world's largest banner will be unfurled,
24,000 square foot, bearing the message: ``Dayton's National Night
Out Against Crime-Drugs.''
   Residents of Chesapeake, Va., plan a ``Dunk the Criminal''
booth. An 88-minute police-civilian softball game is scheduled at
Ashland, Ky.
   Police in Anaheim, Calif., plan to distribute free light bulbs
at a senior citizen center, and in Chicago seniors will launch that
city's campaign by distributing blue ribbons. Mayor Edward Koch of
New York also will hand out ribbons.
   Joining in will be U.S. military installations in West Germany,
England, South Korea, the Netherlands, Iceland, Belgium, Cuba and
Japan. And in Canada, neighborhoods in Edmonton and Burlington
planned to turn out.

<TEXT>
   Authorities investigating a boat racing
accident that injured 23 spectators eliminated a floating railroad
tie as the cause Monday, leaving the wake from other boats as the
prime explanation.
   Early reports suggested the boat driven by 1987 Canadian
National Champion Robert Wood struck the railroad tie.
   ``There's no connection,'' said Public Safety Director Glenn
Cannon. ``There are no marks on it at all to indicate that it was
struck by anything, and we have a witness who places it near the
shore before the impact occurred.''
   Wood's boat, which was clocked at more than 116 mph during time
trials for the Champion Spark Plug Grand Prix event, catapulted out
of the Allegheny River, veered right and crashed into the bank,
where spectators were watching the 11th annual Three Rivers Regatta.
   ``It just seems he hit a wake,'' Cannon said. ``It lifted him up
in the air. When it came down it didn't come down in the manner it
should have. He tried to steer the boat to the left.''
   Wood, who suffered minor injuries and shock, told police he
believed his boat was buffeted by air from the boats he was
following.
   Investigators hoped to determine the speed by studying videotape
of the scene shot from a blimp for Secaucus, N.J., television
station WWOR. The station was covering the New York Mets-Pittsburgh
Pirates baseball game nearby at Three Rivers stadium.
   The boat appeared to slow after it veered toward shore,
apparently no longer under power.
   ``Not only that, but as he hit, the bottom of the engine would
have begun striking the bottom of the river,'' Cannon said. ``And
there's a man-made edge, called riprap, stones together with
cement, that slowed the boat tremendously.''
   Divers continued looking Monday for the last missing piece of
the boat, a piece of metal that was located below the propeller.
The part could confirm whether debris in the river contributed to
the accident, Cannon said.
   Meanwhile, city officials started reviewing crowd control
measures.
   The Parks Department previously used fence to keep spectators
from the river's edge, but ``for some reason ... that was
discontinued,'' Cannon said.
   The fence will probably be back next year, putting an additional
15 to 20 feet of concrete walkway between the water and spectators,
he said.
   Only one of the injured remained in critical condition Monday,
said Allegheny General Hospital spokeswoman Karen Long. Two others
improved to serious, seven remained hospitalized in serious to good
condition, and 13 others were released.

<HEAD>Governors Applaud Vintage Reagan Speech on Big Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's governors warmly applauded
President Reagan on Monday for a vintage attack on Washington and a
tribute to their initiatives in dealing with national issues such
as welfare and job creation.
   ``He was talking language we understand,'' Republican Gov.
Thomas Kean of New Jersey said of Reagan's address to the National
Governors Association.
   Democratic Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas replied,
``Absolutely,'' when asked if he thought it was a political speech
designed to help Vice President George Bush in the presidential
campaign.
   ``But it was one that was appropriate within the limits of the
association,'' Clinton added. ``I think it was as political as he
could be without stepping out of line.''
   Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, the association's most
prominent current member, was not present for the president's
speech.
   The Democratic presidential candidate planned to attend the
closing session of the NGA meeting on Tuesday and then have a
closed strategy session with Democratic governors.
   Reagan never mentioned Bush, Dukakis or the presidential
campaign, but he touted the economic statistics certain to be a key
part of the Bush campaign.
   ``Our states, like our citizens, have known the blessings of the
longest peacetime economic expansion on record,'' he told the
governors, citing the creation of more than 17 million jobs during
his two terms as well as a current unemployment rate that is the
lowest in 14 years.
   The largest part of the president's speech was devoted to citing
the virtues of states as opposed to the federal government _ a
familiar theme of the Reagan presidency.
   ``In the last seven and one-half years we have broken the
federal government of its compulsion to control every breath the
states take,'' Reagan said.
   He said that ``too often in the past when Washington listened to
the states, it heard only what it wanted to hear. Today, things are
different. When governors talk, we not only listen, but we hear.''
   Praising state initiatives, Reagan said that ``from education,
to transportation, to helping America's poor and homeless, you have
led. While Washington has been caught up in partisan intrigue,
you've gone out and done the job.''
   The governors were meeting between the two national political
conventions, but they studiously avoided allowing the campaign to
intrude on their meeting.
   Reagan held to that non-partisan approach. But he was far more
partisan during a stop at U.S. Precision Lens, a firm located a few
miles from the governors meeting.
   Still avoiding mentioning Dukakis by name, the president said,
``I've heard some people bad mouthing our economy recently. I think
they must have stopped reading the newspaper that day in 1981 when
they handed over the lease to the White House.''
   He said ``some people are telling you to take for granted the
economic growth of today and of the last seven years.''
   He characterized that message as telling people ``you can take
prosperity for granted, it's time for a change, take a chance on
us.''
   Reagan said that was ``sort of like someone telling you that
you've stored up all the cold beer you could want, so now you can
unplug the refrigerator. ... You can't unplug our pro-growth
economic policies and expect things to stay the same.''
   Democratic Gov. Richard Celeste of Ohio retorted that ``the
issue is bread and butter, not cold beer.''
   Celeste called Reagan's speech to the governors ``a wonderful
trip down memory lane. ... All of us would agree on the importance
of initiatives on the state level.''
   Kean said Reagan would be a help to Bush, but ``anybody, no
matter how good they are, is a marginal help. It's up to the
candidate who's running.''

Complaint</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines will pay $70,000 to resolve
a government complaint that it discriminated against flight
attendant applicants based on their citizenship status, the Justice
Department said Monday.
   The settlement will cost the air carrier $53,000 in back pay and
$17,000 in federal civil penalties.
   The agreement will affect 33 applicants who qualified as
``intending citizens,'' but whom American refused to consider for
employment _ either because they could not produce an alien
registration card or because their cards had expiration dates.
   ``Intending citizens'' under the 1986 immigration law are
permanent and temporary residents admitted under the new
legalization program, and refugees and those who have sought asylum
who intend to become citizens. The act prohibits employers from
discriminating against them.
   ``We hope this settlement will put others in the airline
industry on notice that the challenged practices are proscribed by
the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986,'' said Lawrence J.
Siskind, the special counsel named under the statute.
   Siskind's office enforces prohibitions against employment
discrimination based on national origin and citizenship status.
   The agreement settles a complaint filed April 12 and cannot be
construed as an admission of liability by American, the department
said.

<HEAD>Discoveries Encourage Search For Intelligent Life Beyond Earth</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The discovery of new planets and of complex
organic chemicals in comets is encouraging astronomers to intensify
their search of the universe for intelligent life beyond the Earth.
   ``The circumstantial evidence is mounting every day'' that
intelligent life could have developed elsewhere in the universe,
Michael J. Klein, manager of NASA's radio search for life, said
Monday. ``It is encouraging.''
   Klein said discoveries announced last week that planet-like
objects have been found orbiting distant stars, and that organic
chemicals thought to be the precursors to life exist in comets
support fundamental theories about life evolving from cosmic
chemistry.
   ``That is the circumstantial evidence that life exists
elsewhere,'' Klein said. ``We know now that the materials are
there. It gives us a good feeling that we are on the right track.''
   He commented at the 20th assembly of the International
Astronomical Union, which is meeting in Baltimore.
   Klein heads a project called the Search for Extraterrestial
Intelligence, or SETI, that is planning to mount an intensified
search for radio signals from civilizations that may exist on
planets orbiting distant stars.
   Programs run by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, by Harvard University, and others have listened for
intelligence-directed radio signals for more than 20 years, but
only a small fraction of the vast universe, and the many radio
frequencies that must be monitored have actually been checked.
   The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is operated by the
California Institute of Technology for NASA, has proposed to expand
the effort with sophisticated new equipment that would listen to
tens of millions of channels at the same time. The equipment would
be monitoried by a computer capable of identifying signals that
could be sent by intelligent life.
   Klein said the new equipment would be able to look at a 1,000
different stars that are thought to be similar to the Earth's sun,
locations that experts believe hold the best chance for the
evolution of life.
   There also would be ``whole sky survey'' in many radio
frequencies in which every portion of the heavens would be
systematically searched.
   Searches in the past ``have only scratched the surface,'' said
Klein.
   The new equipment would be 10 million times more thorough than
present equipment, he said, noting, ``In the first few minutes we
would be able to match all of the searches that were done before.''
   But even with the new devices the job is immense, said Frank
Drake, chairman of a SETI committee of the astronomical union and
an astronomer at the University of California, Santa Cruz.
   ``Many people think the project should succeed in the next year
or two,'' he said. ``That's probably not going to happen. The
universe is so huge and the cosmic haystack so large, it will take
us decades.''
   Drake added: ``The consequences of success are so great that
it's worth dealing with the problems.''
   The theory behind the SETI work is that because there are
billions of galaxies, each with billions of stars, the odds are
good that the conditions that permitted life to evolve on Earth
must exist elsewhere.
   If so, then intelligent life could have developed along the same
lines as it did here on Earth. Civilizations that are equal to or
more advanced than humankind would be sending out signals, just as
occurs on Earth. The SETI project is looking for those signals.
   Such signals may ``leak out'' just as to do on Earth, Drake said.
   ``The strongest sign of our existence in the universe is the
accumulation of our television signals,'' he said. The second most
common radio signal from Earth comes from military communications.
   Klein said the federal budget now under consideration by
Congress includes a $6 million appropriation for the enhanced SETI
equipment. He said the total project would last 10 years and cost
$90 million.
   If the funding is approved, the intensified search could begin
in 1992, with all of the new equipment on line by 1994.

<HEAD>`L.A. Law' Star Reveals Breast Cancer; Will Do NBC Documentary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jill Eikenberry revealed Monday that she was
undergoing treatment for breast cancer while filming the first six
episodes of the hit NBC series ``L.A. Law'' two years ago.
   Eikenberry made a surprise appearance at a news conference held
by NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff to announce she
will help produce with NBC News a documentary about breast cancer
survivors, ``Destined to Survive: 100 Roads to Recovery,'' to air
Oct. 12.
   ``I was one of the lucky ones. I didn't have to lose a breast,''
said Eikenberry, who said the cancer was discovered between filming
of the pilot and beginning of production of the series. ``I had to
undergo radiation therapy during the first six episodes of `L.A.
Law.' It was not an easy time,'' she said.
   Eikenberry plays attorney Ann Kelsey on the series. She and
co-star Michael Tucker are married in real life as well as on the
series.
   ``Between the period of my treatment and diagnosis, I underwent
a tremendous amount of soul-searching and terror, despite the
incredible support of my husband, my family and my friends,'' said
Eikenberry. ``The only real rays of hope came from the women who
had been through these things and survived. They were the ones who
made me feel I wasn't alone.''
   The documentary will profile 100 survivors of breast cancer,
some famous, such as first lady Nancy Reagan, and others not. The
aim is to encourage other women to carefully check themselves for
signs of the disease.
   ``We brought this project to Brandon because we felt, I felt he
would be sympathetic because of his history with Hodgkin's disease,
because he's also destined to live,'' Eikenberry said.
   Tartikoff said he underwent successful treatment of Hodgkin's
disease, a form of cancer, several years ago before he went on to
huge success programming NBC's prime-time lineup.
   ``When Jill brought this to me it honestly did touch a chord,''
he said. ``I do think that what this will say to people who face
any form of cancer, particularly breast cancer, is that you cannot
only survive, you can triumph, flourish and lead meaningful,
productive lives.''

<HEAD>Pershing II Motors to Be Destroyed in Texas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States notified the Soviet Union on
Monday it will begin destroying rocket motors from Pershing II
nuclear missiles on Sept. 8 in Texas.
   The Defense Department, in a brief statement, said the notice
was forwarded to Moscow in accordance with the terms of the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty.
   That treaty, which became effective earlier this summer,
requires the superpowers to dismantle and destroy the
intermediate-and shorter-range nuclear missiles in their arsenals.
The United States has two such types of missiles _ the
ground-launched cruise missile and the Pershing II.
   Destruction of the solid-fuel rocket motors for the Pershing II
missiles will begin on Sept. 8, ``weather permitting,'' at the
Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant near Marshall, Texas, the Pentagon
said. The motors will be destroyed through ``static firing.''
   In a static firing, the motor is bolted into a concrete and
steel structure, ignited and allowed to burn up all its fuel.
   ``The empty motor case will later be crushed and buried in an
approved landfill within the grounds of the ammunition plant,'' the
Pentagon said. ``Under the terms of the INF treaty, Soviet
inspectors have the right to be present during the destruction
process.''

<TEXT>
   Months behind in an industry where everything
is due last week, producers and scriptwriters scrambled Monday to
regroup after a 22-week strike that idled thousands and devastated
the fall television schedule.
   The Writers Guild of America membership Sunday voted 2,111 to
412, or by 83.7 percent, in favor of the pact with the Alliance of
Motion Picture and Television Producers.
   ``I would say nobody's in fighting form,'' NBC Entertainment
President Brandon Tartikoff said.
   The walkout crippled Hollywood and left the upcoming TV season
in shambles. The season's start will be delayed, perhaps until
mid-October or later, despite the anticipated glut of written
material.
   The production season for prime-time television usually begins
in late June and early July.
   ``What we are going to do this morning is what we normally do in
May. We have two writers' meetings today and three tomorrow,''
producer Tony Thomas said in a telephone interview as he drove to
work. ``We are starting from scratch, which is what everyone in
town is doing.''
   Thomas, producer of TV's ``Beauty and the Beast,'' ``The Golden
Girls,'' ``It's A Living'' and ``Empty Nest,'' said the networks
have not reduced their orders, and he expects to produce 22 shows
for ``Beauty and the Beast'' and ``The Golden Girls.''
   ``Probably around the production of the fourth and fifth episode
we will start to feel the crunch because of lack of planning and
have to start spending more money,'' Thomas said. ``You're always
behind in TV, and that will just happen sooner.''
   The ratification came in the 154th day of one of the longest and
most painful strikes in modern Hollywood history, eclipsing by one
day the WGA's 1960 walkout that lasted 153 days.
   ``There have been hardships,'' said Al Di Tolla, president of
the International Association of Theatrical and Stage Employees,
which is holding its annual conference in Reno, Nev., this week.
   Di Tolla said the five-month strike resulted in the worst
unemployment rate in the history of his union, which covers
carpenters, electricians, set decorators, costumers and other
crafts.
   Of the 75,000-member union, up to 60 percent were unemployed, Di
Tolla said. One-third of the union's members are based in Los
Angeles.
   Timothy Wurtz and his writing partner, Glenn Benest, have two
television movies for CBS and two feature films for 20th Century
Fox that will all be due in coming weeks. ``Today, we're starting
on the second draft of one of the TV movies,'' Wurtz said. ``And we
have to deliver a second draft on one of the features within six
weeks.''
   Wurtz said he typically writes four to five hours in the morning
and devotes afternoons to business. ``Now, I might be working eight
to 10 hours a day writing, and I may be working more than five days
a week.''
   At restaurants and messenger services, two peripheral businesses
affected by the strike, managers noted an upswing in business as
early as last week, when a tentative agreement was reached
following several days of rumor.
   ``Thursday and Friday we had a little burst of business,'' said
Frank Casado, who with his wife Lucy owns the El Adobe Mexican
restaurant on Melrose Avenue across the street from Paramount
Studios.
   ``I look forward to things improving. Beside the writers, you
have all the extras. And the carpenters and electricians, those
guys eat pretty good too,'' Casado said. ``It may take awhile. They
may need a few checks to get back ahead of things.''
   Jim Burke, manager of the LA Express messenger service, also
said business had picked up Thursday and Friday. Before the strike,
Burke said, LA Express dealt almost exclusively with entertainment
industry clients and suffered a 50 percent loss in business.
   He said he pushed for new, non-entertainment clients and
recouped about 90 percent of his regular business
   ``Now we hope to go through the roof,'' he said.
   The WGA has 9,000 members, most living and working in Southern
California. The alliance has 217 member companies, responsible for
85 percent of network prime-time television and 90 percent of
feature film production and distribution.

<HEAD>Easter, Sons Convicted of Murder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman and her three sons were convicted Monday
of murder in the deaths of three police officers whose
bullet-riddled bodies lay in a motel room from which the family
held police at bay for 10 hours.
   A Wayne County Circuit Court jury deliberated for 17 hours over
four days in convicting Alberta Easter, 70, and her sons, William
Lemons, 44, Roy Lemons, 48, and George Lemons, 46, of three counts
of first-degree murder each.
   Murder convictions carry mandatory life prison terms.
   They were charged in the deaths of Inkster Officers Daniel
Dubiel, 36, and Clay Hoover, 24, and Sgt. Ira Parker, 41.
   The jury, which heard 13 weeks of testimony, also found the sons
also were found guilty of felony firearms and felonious assault
charges.
   There were many trial delays because George Lemons must have
dialysis treatments.
   The police officers had been trying to serve a bad check warrant
on Easter and one of the Lemons when they were shot. Easter and her
sons then negotiated with police for the release of the officers,
who medical witnesses testified were dead during the siege at the
Bungalow Motel.
   Police and the Easter family exchanged gunfire during much of
the night of July 9, 1987, before the family gave up early the next
day. They have been jailed ever since.
   Easter had claimed both that the officers shot each other while
exchanging gunfire with the family inside the room, and that they
were shot during exchanges between the family and officers outside.
   But autopsy reports said the officers were killed within minutes
of entering the motel room. Hoover and Dubiel were shot 29 times
each, one report said.
   Dubiel and Hoover initially tried to serve the warrant and
called for help from Parker when Easter asked for a delay in her
arrest, saying she wanted to try to straighten the matter out
without going to jail.

<TEXT>
   Seat belt use has curtailed the number of
traffic fatalities, but there is no clear-cut evidence that belt
use laws have reduced the number of injuries in highway accidents,
an insurance industry study claims.
   The report by the Highway Loss Data Institute outlined the
results of a study of automobile accident injury claims before and
after the enactment of mandatory auto seat belt use laws in eight
states.
   It acknowledged that belt use by motorists has reduced the
number of highway fatalities but that the study ``found no
clear-cut evidence of comparable reductions'' in overall injuries
as reflected by accident claims in the eight states.
   ``These results are disappointing,'' the report added.
   The study, which was released this week, examined accident
claims submitted before and after seat belt laws went into effect
in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Maryland,
Michigan and Texas.
   While injury claims declined in Michigan and Connecticut after
belt-use laws went into effect there, they increased from 2 percent
to 6 percent in Texas, Florida and Kansas.
   In New Jersey the number of injury claims remained stable even
though overall collision claims increased as much as 11 percent. No
significant change was found in total injury claims in New York or
Maryland, although the most serious injuries _ those with claims of
more than $1,000 _ increased in both states.
   According to the study, the sharpest injury increases were found
among claims of $1,000 or more. Those jumped 15 percent in Texas,
20 percent in Kansas, 8 percent in Maryland and as much as 7
percent in New York.
   Highway safety experts suggested that belt use in some of the
accidents might have prevented fatalities, but the motorists were
still seriously injured _ inceasing the latter category.
   The sharpest decline in injury claims occurred in Michigan
where, depending on the severity of the injury, there were 6
percent to 17 percent fewer claims filed after belt-use laws went
into effect in 1985.
   ``Although these reductions are impressive, the magnitude of the
decreases are probably due to other factors in addition to the seat
belt law,'' the study said. It noted, for example, that total
collision claims declined as much as 6 percent in Michigan during
the years examined.
   The study suggested several reasons why the belt-use laws in the
eight states did not have a greater effect on overall injury losses:
   _Most insurance claims are for relatively minor injuries, while
belt use is designed to be most effective in preventing serious
injuries.
   _The benefits of belt use in preventing serious injuries may be
``masked'' by injury claims that may be relatively minor but still
expensive to treat.
   _Insurance claim records included injuries to individuals who
may not be subject to belt-use laws such as people riding in the
rear seat of a car.
   _Some of the effects ``could easily have been masked by normal
year-to-year fluctuations'' in accident claims.
   The study compared injury claims submitted to a dozen insurance
companies in the eight states during the 12 months prior to
enactment of belt-use laws and during the 12 months to 24 months
after the laws went into force.

   Iran and Iraq will begin a cease-fire on
Aug. 20 in their 8-year-old Persian Gulf war, Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar announced today.
   The U.N. chief made the announcement to the Security Council,
climaxing several days of intense diplomacy that ended a deadlock
in nearly two weeks of U.N.-mediated truce talks.
   He said face-to-face negotiations between the two sides would
begin Aug. 25 in Geneva under U.N. auspices. The war has killed or
wounded 1 million people since it began in September 1980.
   ``In exercise of the mandate given me by the Security Council, I
now call upon the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Iraq
to observe a cease-fire and discontinue all military activity on
land, at sea and in the air, as of 0300 GMT Aug. 20 (11 p.m. EDT
Aug. 19),'' he said in a statement to the 15-member council.
   ``I note that military activity has decreased in the past few
days,'' the U.N. chief said. ``I wish on this occason to appeal to
all concerned in the strongest possible terms to exercise the
utmost restraint and to refrain forthwith from any hostile action
on land, at sea and in the air in the period of entry into effect
of the cease-fire.''
   But the secretary-general did not announce the other crucial
dates in a U.N. peace plan: The dates for a troop withdrawal,
prisoner exchange and the establishment of a tribunal to assess
responsibility.
   Those dates are to be announced later.
   As he made his announcement, the envoys of Iran and Iraq were
both in the council chamber. It was the first time the two were
present together in the council since the war began. Iran has been
boycotting council sessions.
   Ambassador Mohammed Ja'afar Mahallati of Iran and Ambassador
Ismat Kittani of Iraq did not acknowledge each other's presence,
although they passed within a few feet of each other.
   ``I wish to express my deepest appreciation of the efforts made
by the parties, the members of the Security Council and others over
the past two weeks,'' Perez de Cuellar said. ``I am confident that
I shall be able to count on the continuing cooperation of the
Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Iraq.''
   The Security Council was to convene Tuesday to authorize the
350-man U.N. peacekeeping force which will supervise the
cease-fire. Perez de Cuellar said earlier that it would take about
two weeks to deploy the peacekeeping force from 24 nations that
will monitor the truce along the 730-mile front.
   A report released today by the secretary-general estimated the
cost of the force at $74 million for the first six months.
   In Tehran earlier today, President Ali Khamenei declared the war
is ``apparently coming to a close'' and said international public
opinion had forced Iraq to drop its demand for direct talks before
a cease-fire.
   But he said in a speech to a gathering of Islamic scholars and
specialists in Third World issues that he doubts Iraq is genuinely
interested in peace.
   The U.N. peace talks began after Iran reversed itself and
announced July 18 that it would accept Security Council Resolution
598. Provisions in the resolution include troop withdrawal to
international boundaries and repatriation of prisoners taken in the
war.
   The cease-fire date announcement came after Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati of Iran delivered what amounted to Iran's formal
acceptance of the compromise proposal Saturday by Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein that a cease-fire be followed rapidly by direct
talks on a lasting peace.
   The U.N. peace talks had faltered over Iraq's demand for
face-to-face talks before a cease-fire.
   Iraq's compromise accepted, Kittani declared Sunday as he
entered a meeting with Perez de Cuellar: ``It's a very good day. I
think we are on the road to peace.''
   As he left, Kittani said he had a good meeting, but when asked
if he was satisfied, he said, ``That's something else.''
   Before offering the compromise, Iraq said direct talks were
needed to test Iran's intentions. It accepted Resolution 598 last
year and said it would not now be stampeded into a cease-fire.
   Badly battered by a string of battlefield defeats, Iran had been
pressing for an immediate truce. In the past few weeks, Baghdad has
launched repeated attacks in which Iran says at least 1,700 of its
people were injured by chemical weapons.
   Iraq had been urged by many nations to compromise and agree to
an early cease-fire and peace settlement. But a major factor, U.N.
diplomats said, was the Security Council's assurance to Iraq last
week that its five permanent members would guarantee a peace
settlement.
   The five _ the United States, Britain, China, France and the
Soviet Union _ promised Iraq that they would insist that Iran not
exploit a truce.
   ``We've made another step on the road to peace,'' U.S.
Ambassador Vernon A. Walters said after the Security Council met
with Perez de Cuellar on Sunday. ``There are hurdles of tremendous
resentment and bitterness of eight years of war, but in physical
steps to end the war, we are moving rapidly.''
   The British ambassador, Sir Crispen Tickell, said: ``We are
focusing now on logistical arrangements that should follow a
cease-fire.''
   Asked if there were major problems, he replied: ``It's much more
a question of logistics, sorting out the many problems attendant on
setting up this (peacekeeping) force.''

<HEAD>Reagan May Sign Bill Increasing Industry Liability in Nuke
Accident</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan is expected to sign
legislation to require nuclear power companies to take a bigger
financial responsibility for damages arising from a reactor
accident, an administration official said Monday.
   ``We have strongly supported this bill,'' the official said of
the proposed 15-year renewal of the 1957 Price-Anderson Act that
won final congressional approval on a voice vote Friday in the
Senate.
   ``It is likely that he will sign it,'' said the Office of
Management and Budget official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Price-Anderson Act is unique because it is the only federal
statute that sets a limit on how much a company or an entire
industry can be forced to pay to victims of an industrial accident.
   The bill would set the liability limit for the nuclear
generating industry at $7.1 billion for all damages from a single
accident. That is 10 times the amount the industry was responsible
for under the previous law, which expired a year ago.
   If damage awards exceeded the limit, Congress would have to come
up with a legislative plan to supply the rest of the money.
   The $7.1 billion limit walks a line between the nuclear
industry, which sought a lower figure, and interest groups like
Public Citizen, the Ralph Nader-founded organization which pushed
for a higher limit or none at all.
   Public Citizen has pointed to government studies suggesting that
a catastrophic nuclear accident could cause $100 billion or more in
damages. Critics say the Treasury could end up providing most of
the compensation.
   David Hamilton, national field director of U.S. Public Interest
Research Group, said that ``while the (new) cap is a net
improvement over current law, the revision does little more than
current law to encourage corporate responsibility, to protect
taxpayers from having to pay for a nuclear accident or to ensure
that all legitimate victims of an accident are compensated.''
   Steve Unglesbee, director of legislative communications for the
American Nuclear Energy Council, an industry group, called the
legislation ``a big step forward in compensation'' for victims.
   Renewal of the Price-Anderson Act is not expected to spur
construction of new nuclear power plants. Unglesbee says that to
revive the industry, the federal licensing procedure needs to be
streamlined and a standardized plant design must be established.
   And barring an accident requiring large payments to victims, the
higher liability limit is not expected to have any major impact on
electricity rates charged by utilities with nuclear plants,
according to congressional aides.

<HEAD>Former Actor Seeks House Nomination; Illinoisans To Pick Successor
to Price</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA W. BARNAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Former actor Ben Jones of ``Dukes of Hazzard'' fame tries again
for Congress in Tuesday's Georgia primary, while voters in southern
Illinois chose a successor to the late Rep. Mel Price and Colorado
voters also pick House nominees.
   Also at stake as Georgians settle on nominees in 10 House
districts is the Democratic nod for the seat held by Republican
Rep. Newt Gingrich. Gingrich, who is unopposed for his party's
nomination, has been in the forefront of efforts to force an
investigation of House Speaker Jim Wright.
   In the Atlanta area's 4th congressional district, Jones, who
played the rustic mechanic ``Cooter'' on the comedy series, is
regarded as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination to face
Republican Rep. Pat Swindall in the fall.
   Swindall, a two-term congressman whose views appeal to the
religious right, is considered vulnerable as a result of his
admission that he considered accepting laundered drug money during
a home loan transaction.
   The congressman, videotaped by government investigators, said he
was ashamed he considered the deal but insisted he broke no law
because he ultimately rejected it. He has no primary opposition.
   Jones, who won 47 percent of the vote in his race against
Swindall in 1986, faces attorney Nick Moraitakis and theater
operator John Stembler.
   In the 6th District, which runs south and west of Atlanta, David
Worley, a 30-year-old attorney, and businessman Clyde Eugene Owens,
51, are competing for the chance to face Gingrich, a five-term
congressman, in November.
   In Illinois, the election to fill the unexpired term of Price is
a dress rehearsal for the Nov. 8 general election, when the same
candidates vie for a full two-year term in the 21st district.
Price, a Democrat who had held the seat for nearly 44 years, died
April 22 at 83.
   Democrat Jerry Costello, 38, is the St. Clair County board
chairman and one of southern Illinois' most powerful party leaders.
His opponent, Republican Robert Gaffner, 55, an administrator at
St. Louis Community College, came within 843 votes of defeating
Price in 1986.
   The two men had emerged as their parties' November nominees
after Price announced he would not run for another term.
   In Colorado, the action in determining nominees for the six
House seats was on the Republican side, with primary contests to
determine opponents to Democratic congressmen David Skaggs of the
2nd District and Ben Nighthorse Campbell in the 3rd.
   State Rep. David Bath of Arvada and former Secretary of State
Mary Estill Buchanan face off to oppose Skaggs in the Boulder
County district, which includes the northwest fringes of the Denver
area.
   Buchanan was Colorado's first woman secretary of state. In 1980,
she won the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate and lost to Democrat
Gary Hart in a close race.
   In the 3rd District, which spans much of western and southern
Colorado, one of the two GOP candidates, Montrose County
Commissioner Ken Neesham, has suspended his campaign. He is
embroiled in a criminal investigation of alleged illegal use of
county road equipment.
   The other, real estate agent Jim Zartman, has been traveling
1,000 miles a week throughout the district to gain name recognition
in hopes of unseating Campbell.
   And in Lyons, Ga., Annie Laurie Hussey, who has been Toombs
County probate judge since 1945, is seeking her 12th four-year term
in office at the age of 91.
   ``My doctor says I'm healthy and all the lawyers in Toombs
County are behind me,'' said the judge, a great-grandmother.
   Jackie Driskell, a legal secretary, is running against Mrs.
Hussey.

<TEXT>
   George P. Shultz joined the Reagan
administration in 1982 and, combined with previous tasks during his
service to President Nixon, he has spent 11 years as a Cabinet
officer, sixth on the all-time list.
   During his tenure as secretary of state, Shultz has flown over 1
million miles to more than 70 countries, and it was on a visit to
Bolivia on Monday that he had his closest brush with danger.
   A bomb exploded as his motorcade was making its way from the
airport to downtown La Paz, but Shultz and other members of his
party escaped injury.
   When Alexander M. Haig Jr. resigned unexpectedly as secretary in
June 1982, President Reagan was intent on finding a replacement who
could win swift Senate confirmation.
   Reagan settled quickly on Shultz, whose appointment was greeted
with bipartisan praise. He assumed his duties less than a month
later, becoming the first official in U.S. history to serve in four
Cabinet-level posts _ State, Treasury, Labor and the Office of
Management and Budget.
   Shultz's most significant achievement has been was a treaty with
the Soviet Union to abolish all U.S. and Soviet intermediate-range
nuclear missiles. His biggest disappointments thus far have been
the administration's inability to bring about peace and democracy
in Nicaragua and to promote Arab-Israeli peace negotiations.
   But Shultz cannot be faulted for lack of effort. He has made
four trips to the Middle East this year and, on Wednesday, he will
make his third trip to Central America in five weeks.
   Shultz became secretary of state after serving as president of
the Bechtel Group, an international construction and engineering
firm where his annual income was estimated at $500,000 to $1
million.
   To many, Shultz looks and sounds like an economics professor on
leave from Stanford University, which he is.
   ``They've established a chair in my honor,'' he frequently
remarks. ``I told them when I`m through with this job, I`ll need a
couch.''

   The new Central Park Zoo opened Monday amid much
fanfare, with a collection of penguins, polar bears, piranhas and
their pals entertaining huge crowds in their recently renovated $30
million home.
   A four-block-long line snaked through the park within an hour of
the opening as New Yorkers waited for their first look at rarities
such as the Golfodulcean Dart poison frog, the tufted puffin or the
plumbeous water redstart (that's a bird, folks).
   ``These animals know how to act. They're not like people, who
have to learn how to act,'' said 11-year-old Patricia Benitez, one
of the first visitors to the Tropic Zone _ one of the zoo's three
new natural habitats.
   Monkeys, bats, fish and frogs were featured there; the Polar
Circle hosts polar bears, penguins and arctic foxes; the Temperate
Territory is home to otters, red pandas, turtles and sea lions. In
all, 13,701 visitors toured the three areas on its first day, the
Parks Department said.
   ``When Mayor Koch appointed me five years ago, I promised to be
a man for all species,'' said Parks Commissioner Henry Stern, who
introduced the 450 animals from more than 100 species.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch then cut the ribbon to officially open the
new facility before playing straight man to a frisky sea lion named
Finn.
   Finn, circling in the newly renovated sea lion tank in the
middle of the park, waved to Koch, waved to the visitors, caught
fish tossed by the mayor and barked on request.
   The renovation of the zoo was supposed to cost $28 million, but
came in at about $30 million, partly because work took several
months longer than anticipated, Stern said. Construction on the new
zoo began in April 1985.
   ``The other zoo was like a Sing-Sing for animals,'' said Stern,
referring to the facility shut down in the winter of 1983. ``So
we've built a humane zoo, a zoo for the 1990s.''
   There was one other new feature: Visitors, who once toured for
free, now pay $1; senior citizens pay 50 cents, while kids come
through for a quarter.

   Helena M. O'Brien was an Army nurse in Hawaii
during World War II when she met her future husband.
   Five months after the war's end, she and George P. Shultz, a
Marine officer at the time, were married. They celebrated their
42nd wedding anniversary last February.
   ``O'Bie'' Shultz, as she is known to friends, is a frequent
traveling companion of her husband, the secretary of state, and was
a passenger in Shultz's motorcade Monday in La Paz, Bolivia, when a
terrorist bomb went off.
   The car in which she was riding was slightly damaged but she and
others in the caravan escaped injury.
   The Shultzes have remained a very close couple over the years, a
fact amply demonstrated at the time of his appointment to the State
Department in July 1982.
   On arrival in Washington after being summoned from London,
Shultz found two limousines awaiting him at the airport.
   One, he was told, was for him, the other for his wife to take
her anywhere she wanted to go while Shultz had his interview with
President Reagan.
   Shultz waved off the second car. ``No,'' he said, ``she'll come
with me. We're a package deal.''
   Mrs. Shultz, who does not tell her age, lists her special
interests and hobbies as handicapped children, gardening, golf,
traveling and ``taking care of and keeping up with George.''
   She looks forward to the time next January when Shultz returns
to private life after six years at the State Department. They have
homes in Stanford, Calif., and Cummington, Mass., and have five
children and five grandchildren.
   The last was born after the Moscow summit. Afterward, Mrs.
Shultz scrapped plans to accompany her husband to Spain and the
Middle East, going instead to California to help with her new
grandchild.

<TEXT>
   The Navy said Monday it had successfully
demonstrated a submarine ``capsule launch'' system for a Tomahawk
cruise missile during a test in the Gulf of Mexico.
   The test firing was performed by the nuclear-powered USS
Providence on Sunday and involved a conventional land-attack
version of the Tomahawk fitted into a specially added ``capsule''
in the bow of the submarine.
   The cruise missile _ carrying an inert warhead for the test _
was launched from the submerged submarine and then ``flew a fully
guided land-attack mission of approximately 450 miles to a recovery
area on the Eglin Air Force Base, Fla., range,'' the Navy said.
   The test was important because it demonstrated that land-attack
cruise missiles can be carried and stored aboard a submarine in the
bow, outside the pressure hull, and fired from that position, said
Bob Holsapple, a spokesman.
   Without such a capsule launch system in the bow, a submarine
cannot be armed with cruise missiles without reducing its arsenal
of on-board torpedoes, he added.

   Daniel F. Gilmore, a veteran foreign
correspondent who covered Europe, Asia and the Middle East for
United Press International during more than 40 years with the wire
service, died Sunday of emphysema. He was 66.
   At the time of his death, Gilmore was senior correspondent for
Maturity News Service, a nationally syndicated wire service
covering issues affecting older Americans.
   Gilmore, a native New Yorker, began his journalism career as a
copy boy for The Associated Press and Time magazine. He joined
United Press, as the agency was then known, in 1941 but left to
join the Army Air Force in 1942.
   He saw action in the European theater during World War II, and
received the Purple Heart and air medal with three clusters.
   Gilmore was the lead radio operator-gunner with the Hell's
Angels B-17 bomber squadron that operated out of England. In March
1944, Gilmore's plane was shot down over Europe and he was rescued
by French Resistance forces, who hid him for two months. German
border guards captured him in the Pyrenees Mountains as he was
attempting to reach Spain. He was freed in May 1945 by British
forces six days before Germany surrendered.
   After rejoining United Press, Gilmore served in bureaus in
London, Rome, Vienna, Frankfurt and Hong Kong. Assignments also
took him to the Soviet Union, the Middle East, Africa and Indochina.
   While in Rome, he met and married Clare Lorene Brubaker, of
Johnstown, Pa., a State Department employee at the U.S. Embassy.
   Gilmore was UPI European news editor from 1962 to 1972. He was
the service's Asian division chief, directing the coverage of the
Vietnam War, from 1972 to 1973. From 1973 until his retirement in
1987, he worked in Washington as head of UPI's national security
affairs team.
   He is survived by his wife Clare; mother, Elizabeth; sister,
Margaret Calkin; and brother, Patrick. Burial will be in Arlington
National Cemetery.

Monday, delivered in English, announcing dates for a cease-fire in
the Iran-Iraq war and the beginning of peace talks:
   Members of the council are aware that over the past two weeks, I
have been engaged in intensive diplomatic activity aimed at
achieving the implementation of Security Council Resolution 598
(1987).
   As a result of these efforts and in exercise of the mandate
given to me by the Security Council, I now call upon the Islamic
Republic of Iran and the Republic of Iraq to observe a cease-fire
and to discontinue all military action on land, at sea and in the
air as of 0300 GMT on 20 August 1988.
   I have been assured by the two parties to the conflict that they
will observe this cease-fire in the context of the full
implementation of Resolution 598.
   The governments of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic
of Iraq have also agreed to the deployment of United Nations
observers as of the time and date of the cease-fire.
   I shall extend to the Islamic Republic of Iran and to the
Republic of Iraq a formal invitation to send their representatives
to Geneva on 25 August for direct talks under my auspices. I am
sending letters in this connection to both sides.
   On the date of the cease-fire, I shall confirm that I am making
the necessary preparations aimed at carrying out the mandate
entrusted to me by the resolution under the various operative
paragraphs, in particular paragraphs 4, 6, 7 and 8.
   I note that military activity has decreased in the past few
days. I wish on this occasion, however, to appeal to all concerned,
in the strongest possible terms, to exercise the utmost restraint
and to refrain from any hostile activity on land, at sea and in the
air in the period before entry into effect of the cease-fire.
   I wish to express my deepest appreciation for the efforts made
by the parties, the members of the Security Council and others over
the past weeks. I am confident that I shall be able to count on the
continuing coooperation of the representatives of the Islamic
Republic of Iran and the Republic of Iraq when we convene in Geneva.
   The restoration of peace will bring to the peoples of both
countries victories far greater than those of war.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Monday passed an emergency hunger
relief bill that extends a temporary food program for a year and
requires the government to buy an extra $110 million in surplus
commodities for the needy.
   The bill, similar to one passed last month by the Senate, also
makes small increases in food stamp benefits and makes it easier
for farmers, the disabled and the elderly to qualify for food
stamps.
   The measure goes to a conference committee to be reconciled with
the Senate bill.
   The House bill, passed by voice vote, extends through fiscal
1989 the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program which
distributes surplus agricultural commodities to the needy.
   The bill earmarks an extra $70 million for TEFAP and the
remaining $40 million for commodities to be distributed by soup
kitchens and food banks.
   Including the food stamp changes, the Congressional Budget
Office has estimated the bill will cost $306 million in fiscal
1989, rising gradually to $671 million in 1993.
   The Reagan administration has said it opposes the bill for
budget and policy reasons.

   The Duchess of York, 28-year-old wife of Prince
Andrew, gave birth today to a 6 lb. 12 oz. daughter, the couple's
first child who is fifth in line to the British throne, Buckingham
Palace said.
   Mother and child are both doing well, the palace said.
   Andrew, the Duke of York and second son of Queen Elizabeth II,
was with his wife when she was ``safely delivered of a daughter at
8:18 p.m. (3:18 p.m EDT) today,'' the palace said.
   ``Her Royal Highness and the child are both well,'' the palace
statement concluded.
   The 28-year-old prince, a Royal Navy lieutenant, returned to
London on Sunday from Singapore, where he has been on duty with the
ship HMS Edinburgh, to be on hand for the birth.
   Andrew drove his wife to the rear entrance of Portland Hospital
from their rented home 21 miles west of London this morning.
   The prince left the hospital briefly but spent the rest of the
day and evening with her. The duchess' mother, Susan Barrantes, who
had flown from her home in Argentina for the birth, also was at the
hospital.
   The queen, who was opening a new Lever Brothers soap-making
plant at Port Sunlight on the Wirral in northwest England, joked
earlier in the day that the baby was taking a long time to arrive.
   ``We hope it is soon. We are fed up with waiting,'' the queen
told young mother Heidi Courtney during a tour of the plant earlier
today.
   Mrs. Courtney's 22-month-old blonde, curly-haired daughter Carla
handed a teddy bear to the queen, who said: ``If it is a little
girl, I hope my grandchild has curly hair like this.''
   Bookmakers William Hill stopped taking bets on the sex and name
of the baby in May after Andrew was quoted as saying it would be a
girl called Annabel.
   The baby will be Her Royal Highness, Princess of York. She is
fifth in line to the throne behind Andrew's older brother, Prince
Charles, his two children, Prince William and Prince Harry, and
Andrew himself. The queen's two other grandchildren, Peter and Zara
Phillips, are the children of her only daughter, Anne.
   Dr. Anthony Kenney, 45, the duchess' obstetrician, and a team of
specialists were on hand for her arrival at the $590-a-day
American-owned hospital.
   Most photographers who had camped in front of the hospital for
weeks missed the duchess' arrival. Even the few who were outside
the rear entrance said they caught only a glimpse of the duchess as
the car sped inside.
   The duchess' father, Maj. Ronald Ferguson, was quoted by the
British media as telling fellow polo players that baby's due date
was Aug. 11.
   Andrew married the former Sarah Ferguson on July 23, 1986 at
Westminster Abbey.
   Hours after his arrival on Sunday, Andrew took his wife for a
20-minute drive in the Surrey countryside on what was the hottest
day of the year.
   Outside the hospital, crowds had been waiting for several days
and started growing as soon as the word was out that the duchess
had been admitted.
   A white banner has been flying outside the hospital for several
days saying: ``Any Minute Now!''

   Farm state governors Monday approved a
resolution commending the Reagan administration and Congress for
quick action on an aid package for farmers hit hard by the drought.
   The governors, in a report from a task force chaired by Iowa
Gov. Terry Branstad, also urged continued federal and state
attention to the problems of farmers struggling to cope with
today's economics and international trade imbalances.
   The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of the
National Governors' Association unanimously approved a resolution
praising Washington for quick action on a $3.9 billion bill to
provide emergency help to farmers whose crops and livestock are
suffering because of this year's drought.
   ``The legislation that Congress is set to pass is excellent,
far-reaching legislation that provides assistance to livestock and
crop producers,'' the committee, chaired by North Dakota Gov.
George A. Sinner, a Democrat, said in its resolution.
   A House-Senate conference committee approved a compromise
version of the bill Thursday, and the Senate approved it Monday.
The legislation was expected to receive final legislative approval
in the House as early as Tuesday. President Reagan is expected to
sign it into law within days of receiving it.
   Governors at the National Governors' Association annual meeting
this week in Cincinnati said U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng has been particularly cooperative in aiding the drought relief
effort.
   ``I've been in this business a long time, folks, and I've never
seen this kind of response from the Department of Agriculture,''
said Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich, a member of the governors'
agriculture committee.
   The committee approved the 67-page report from Branstad's task
force. The report urges federal and state governments to give
continuing attention and support to rural America as it fights to
cope with depressed farm prices and declining value of farm land.
   The task force's report said the average price of farm land per
acre went from $219 in 1972 to $823 in 1982, then back down to $547
in 1987.
   It urged states to help rural communities prepare for the future
by creating special offices for rural affairs, providing tailored
development information for rural areas and helping rural
industries develop new products and find new markets.
   The report also urged Washington to shape federal policies with
more sensivitity to their impact on rural America.

   Iranian leaders issued new calls for
vigilance Monday, the day the U.N. secretary-general announced a
cease-fire in the long war with Iraq, but people in the Iranian
capital seemed ready for peace.
   Newspapers carried reports on a Cabinet meeting in which members
stressed the need ``for complete readiness and presence of
combatants'' and more military volunteers. State television said
the Iraqis shelled a village, wounding three civilians, and Tehran
radio reported several violations of Iranian air space by Iraqi
fighters.
   Residents of Tehran appeared convinced the end to the fighting
was at hand. Even President Ali Khamenei, who expressed serious
doubts about the truce prospects a few days ago, told an
international conference the 8-year-old war ``is apparently coming
to a close.''
   He told a conference of Islamic scholars, however, that Iraq's
conduct during negotiations at the United Nations in New York
``gives us the right to have doubts about their real aims.''
   Kayhan, one of the main afternoon papers, carried the headline
``Cease-fire to be announced tonight.'' Inside were photographs and
brief biographies of ``martyrs'' _ Iranians killed in action.
   Javier Perez de Cuellar, the U.N. secretary-general, announced
Monday in New York that the truce will begin Aug. 20 and peace
negotiations between Iran and Iraq will open five days later in
Geneva.
   A driver who spoke English and said he formerly held a well-paid
job in construction, told a visitor: ``My son, Romin, has sent a
message that he is coming home in four weeks now that the fighting
ends. He has been in the army for two years and eight months.
Luckily he has not been wounded. The place where is he is now is
pretty quiet.''
   A 25-year-old named Fahrad said he was excused from military
service because of injuries he suffered in a car accident while
studying petrochemical engineering in Los Angeles.
   ``Many of my generation are dead,'' he said. ``In a way I was
lucky to have been in that accident.''
   An Associated Press reporter requested permission to visit
front-line troops preparing for the truce, but a Ministry of
Islamic Guidance official said it was not possible. A request to
visit Tehran's war cemetery brought the same answer.
   The English-language Tehran Times carried comments from Iranians
on Monday about the government's acceptance of a U.N. Security
Council's cease-fire resolution a year after it was passed.
   Brig. Gen. Morteza Mohammadi, described as commander of
``Division 81 in Khoramabad'' gave what seemed a typical answer:
   ``Being a follower of the imam (Ayatollah Ruhollah Kkhomeini),
we obey his decree whatever it is.
   ``In fact, there are three major reasons for our compliance:
First, being Moslems, Imam Khomeini is our religious leader.
Second, being Iranians, Imam Khomeini is the leader of the leader
of the Islamic revolution. Thirdly, we are the army, and Imam
Khomeini is the supreme commander of the armed forces.''
   Private Khazrullah Panah said:: ``Although I enjoy war, the
imam's order is the ultimate order for us.''
   Habibullah Nasrullah Tabar, a 20-year-old Basij (volunteer)
said: ``If the imam tells us to fight for a hundred years we will.
If he deems it right to negotiate with the enemy, we will too.''

<HEAD>Diner Spills Beans; Tax Refund Considered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORRANCE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It may not add up to a hill of beans,
but some 7-Eleven store clerks have been wrongly charging state
sales tax on cold burritos.
   The case is causing heartburn for 7-Eleven bosses and state tax
authorities, who say they may have to consider a refund of excess
taxes charged on the Mexican-style snacks.
   The state's tax agency, the Board of Equalization, is trying to
work out just how much tax may have been mistakenly charged on
burritos over the last three years at the 1,500 7-Eleven franchises
in California, said Paul Hand, a board supervisor.
   There are no immediate plans for a refund but one may be
considered, Hand said. Any refund would have to come from the
state, since that's where the money ended up, Hand said.
   Burritos fall into a sort of gray area when it comes to sales
tax. Fast food prepared by a store worker is taxed 6{ percent in
Los Angeles County and 6 percent in most other counties. But food
that isn't prepared by employees isn't taxed.
   Three years ago, Tom McFarland, who estimates he's eaten about
75 beef burritos from 7-Eleven, noticed the tax, got hot under the
collar, and complained to the company.
   Norman Corlett, a spokesman for Southland Corp., which owns
7-Eleven, said clerks were notified to sell the burritos without
tax.
   But McFarland, 39, an unemployed electrical engineer from
Torrance, noticed recently the tax was still being charged, and he
spilled the beans to the Board of Equalization.
   Corlett said Southland has repeated its notice to clerks.
   Hand said state authorities don't know how many burritos may
have been improperly taxed. Corlett refused to reveal the extent of
7-Eleven's burrito sales in California.
   Further complicating things is the fact 7-Elevens are equipped
with microwave ovens. If clerks cook the burrito in the microwave,
it's taxable; if the customer cooks his own, it's considered a
grocery item and not taxable.

   Two more people have died of injuries
suffered in the crash of a Bulgarian airliner last week, bringing
the death toll to 27, the state news agency BTA reported Monday.
   The Soviet-designed Yak-40 jetliner, with 33 passengers and four
crew members on board, crashed into a river bed Tuesday after
failing to take off from Sofia airport. The cause of the accident
has not been determined.
   The latest casualties were a 29-year-old Yugoslav and the flight
engineer, the agency said.
   Twenty-three people died at the time of the crash, and two more
died a day later.
   Nine passengers remain hospitalized, all of them Bulgarians.
   The plane was scheduled to fly from the Bulgarian capital to the
city of Varna on the Black Sea.

   Vice President George Bush exhorted
Republican platform writers Monday to make GOP policies clear,
including an ironclad commitment against a tax increase, rather
than turn out a ``document of deceit'' as he said the Democrats had
done.
   Bush said the Republican platform must offer American voters ``a
plan for the future, a statement of solutions, not an exercise in
evasion.''
   He journeyed here from his vacation home in Kennebunkport,
Maine, to put his personal stamp on the platform that the
106-member committee will draft this week and present to the
Republican National Convention next Tuesday.
   Committee members cheered when he depicted Democratic nominee
Michael Dukakis as ``the stealth candidate'' whose ``policies are
invisible.''
   He said Dukakis' declaration in his acceptance speech that this
is an election ``about competence, not ideology,'' was merely ``an
attempt to convince America that ideas don't matter.''
   ``Our campaign will be different because ideas do matter,'' said
Bush, adding that voters must choose between ``two entire sets of
values.''
   ``I will not raise your taxes, period, and I hope the plaform
will say the same thing,'' he said. ``I believe that the way to cut
the federal deficit is to rein in spending, not by rounding up more
taxes.''
   On other issues, he made a pitch for his proposed $2.2 billion
child-care tax credit for low-income families, and pledged tough
enforcement of fair trade laws.
   He went over many other campaign stands, including his calls for
tax-free college savings bonds, a ban on ocean dumping of sludge
and imposition of the death penalty for narcotics kingpins and
killers of police.
   Bush promised ``faster action to clean up toxic waste (and) a
tougher line on acid rain.''
   He repeated his pledge ``to develop and deploy a strategic
defense system as soon as possible,'' and he accused Dukakis of
being ``silent at best and unsteady at worst'' on arms control and
foreign policy issues.
   Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr, the chairman of the platform committee,
hailed Bush as ``a champion of traditional values.''
   She said that ``vague generalities in the Democratic platform
are going to cost the taxpayer close to $45 billion in 1989.''
   Orr, speaking with reporters, provided no specifics but said
that was the preliminary estimate of Republican analysts who have
taken a close look at both the Democratic platform and Dukakis'
campaign promises.
   Her committee spent most of the day divided into seven
subcommittees, hearing testimony from more than 200 witnesses,
including Contra leader Adolfo Calero, anti-ERA activist Phyllis
Schlafly and Edward Teller, the H-bomb inventor and father of the
Strategic Defense Initiative.
   The 1988 GOP platform was expected to hew closely to the
anti-tax and anti-abortion lines of the party's 1984 platform, with
new or reworded planks on such emergent issues as AIDS, drugs,
education and child care.
   Calero urged ``the party of Lincoln'' to renew its pledge of
support for the Nicaraguan rebels.
   He told reporters Dukakis, an adamant opponent of Contra aid,
``doesn't understand the Sandinistas apparently. He doesn't
understand the threat they represent. He doesn't understand that
they are bent on ... expanding the revolution.''
   In a subcommittee hearing on family and community, witnesses
clashed over whether the party should change its traditional
conservative positions on such issues as child care and abortion.
   Bill Hamilton, director of Planned Parenthood's Washington
office, said a poll conducted by his organization showed that the
party's convention delegates ``disagree with many of the planks and
with the tone of your 1984 platform around family planning and
other reproductive health questions.''
   For instance, he said, the 400 delegates interviewed by
telephone in late June and early July by the Analysis Group of New
Haven, Conn., were evenly split on a constitutional amendment
against abortion and a majority believed abortion a private matter
between a woman, her family and doctor.
   But Kay James of the National Right to Life and the Black
Americans for Life said that the right-to-privacy argument is ``the
new catchword for abortion.''
   She and others urged the GOP to maintain its condemnation of
abortion.
   Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, one of the crafters of the
Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law, told the subcommittee on the
economy, ``Half of the growth in federal revenues ought to go back
to people who pull the wagon, who do the work, who pay the taxes.
Democrats want people who ride in the wagon to get all the money so
they can watch Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson share the reins.''
   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah told a family subcommittee that the
Democrats' $2.5 billion child-care bill ``would throw money from
the top down, a Washington bureaucratic approach.''
   Sen. Bob Kasten of Wisconsin, co-chairman of the platform
committee, said in an interview, ``Generally speaking, I sense
we're not likely to revisit in great detail some of the debates we
had in '80 and '84 on ERA and abortion.''
   The seven subcommittees will vote on proposed planks Tuesday,
then the full panel will spend three days trying to put the entire
platform together.

   South Africa, Cuba and Angola
on Monday declared an immediate cease-fire in the 13-year Angolan
war. South Africa also said it plans to begin granting independence
to South-West Africa on Nov. 1.
   Foreign Minister Roelof Botha cautioned, however, that more
talks are needed to reach agreement on a mutual date for the
withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola and independence for
South-West Africa, commonly known as Namibia.
   Botha said South Africa, Cuba, Angola and mediators from the
United States will seek to set a date when they hold peace talks
the week of Aug. 22 at a site still to be announced.
   ``A de facto cessation of hostilities (in Angola) is now in
effect,'' Botha told a news conference in Pretoria.
   ``This is the first step of a very long, arduous road to peace.''
   Angola's Marxist government later said it had accepted the
agreement along with its Cuban allies. Its Foreign Ministry
statement was reported by Angola's official Angop news agency and
monitored in Lisbon. Angola is a former Portuguese colony.
   The Cuban government news agency Prensa Latina said an agreement
in principle ending fighting in Namibia and granting Namibia
independence this year has been converted into a permanent treaty
and goes into force at once.
   It said in a dispatch from Havana, monitored in Mexico City,
that Cuba, Angola and South Africa agreed in Geneva last week to
make the tentative 14-point agreement reached in July in New York
``an official treaty.''
   The South-West African People's Organization (SWAPO), which has
fought since 1966 for Namibian independence, said it would abide by
the cease-fire pact.
   But UNITA (the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola) said, ``There can be no effective cease-fire in Angola if
UNITA's position is not taken into account.''
   Neither SWAPO nor UNITA was involved in the direct peace
negotiations.
   Jonas Savimbi's UNITA rebel movement has said it will not be
bound by any agreement unless Unita is brought into negotiations.
It seeks a power-sharing accord with the Angolan government, which
refuses to negotiate with it.
   In Washington, the State Department released a joint statement
in the name of Cuba, Angola and South Africa, stating that the
parties set a Sept. 1 deadline for agreement on a timetable for the
total withdrawal of Cuban troops.
   Other U.S. officials said they believe agreement is possible if
Cuba and Angola drop their insistence on a four-year withdrawal
time frame and agree to an 18-month to 24-month withdrawal period.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Cuba
and Angola also would have to agree on a substantial Cuban troop
withdrawal during the early phases.
   The developments followed last week's fifth round of peace talks
held in Geneva.
   Botha said South Africa planned to pull its estimated 3,000
troops out of Angola by Sept. 1.
   South Africa and the United States back UNITA in its fight
against the Angolan government, which is supported by an estimated
50,000 Cuban troops.
   Botha said South Africa sent a formal recommendation to U.N.
Secretary- General Javier Perez de Cuellar indicating his country's
willingness to begin withdrawing from Namibia on Nov. 1. He said
South Africa invited Perez de Cuellar for a visit to discuss
Namibian independence.
   South Africa has administered Namibia for 73 years and has an
estimated 50,000 troops in the territory.
   Botha said South Africa will not begin pulling out of Namibia on
Nov. 1 unless Namibia's independence date is linked with the total
Cuban withdrawal from Angola.
   At Geneva, South Africa proposed calling for Namibian
independence by next June 1 if Cuba leaves Angola by that date.
   Botha's announcement Monday suggested the two sides were close
to agreeing on a common date.
   South Africa would grant Namibia its independence under terms of
U.N. Resolution 435, which the Security Council passed in 1978 and
which calls for U.N.-supervised elections, Botha said.
   The United Nations in 1966 revoked South Africa's mandate over
Namibia, a huge, but sparsely populated land of 1.3 million people.
   SWAPO, which has bases in southern Angola, would be the clear
favorite to win independence elections in Namibia.
   Issues that would still have to be resolved include:
   _The future of UNITA.
   _African National Congress bases in Angola. South Africa says
the ANC, the main black group fighting to overthrow South Africa's
white-led government, has seven military bases in Angola and South
Africa wants them shut down.
   _Financial aid for Namibia. South Africa now spends millions of
dollars annually on Namibia and guarantees its loans. South Africa
wants someone else to help Namibia pay its bills.

   Water-borne diseases have claimed 30
more lives in India, raising to at least 858 the number of people
killed by the epidemic, according to media reports.
   Cholera and gastroenteritis have claimed 11 more lives in New
Delhi, the United News of India and Press Trust of India reported
Sunday. At least 260 people in the capital have died of the
diseases, the reports said.
   More than 6,000 people in New Delhi were admitted to hospitals
with symptoms of the diseases, the reports said. They said 818 of
the cases were diagnosed as cholera.
   Health clinics have inoculated more than 28 million Indians
again cholera, United News said. India's population is 800 million.
   Health officials blame the epidemic, which began in early July,
on flood waters washing through sewage and uncollected garbage and
seeping into drinking water supplies.
   The slums of New Delhi, where the garbage has not been collected
in months, is hardest-hit by the epidemic.

   One of the Navy's key contracting offices has
become so dependent on outside consultants it has turned
contractors into the watchdogs of other contractors, according to
an internal Navy report.
   The report by the Navy's inspector general, which focuses on the
Naval Sea Systems Command, complains that ``in some case, it has
become difficult to determine where government workers' functions
stop and contractors' begin.''
   There also is no question but that private consultants working
for the Navy ``have been given access to information which should
be seen by only government personnel,'' the report states.
   Contracts have been awarded to consultants to write
specifications, prepare cost estimates and monitor other
contractors, the report continues. And it is ``arguable'' whether
in the process, the command hasn't ``abdicated to contractors whose
primary motive is profit'' the responsibility for protecting the
public interest, the report concluded.
   ``Through budget and contract review, it is estimated that (the
command) will expend more than $500 million of its $708 million
fiscal 1988 contract support services budget for program management
support work more appropriately and traditionally performed by
government employees,'' it said.
   The inspector general recommended the Navy command slash its use
of outside contractors by 50 percent over the next three years and
hold ``in abeyance'' any contracts whose purpose could not be
clearly established.
   The Navy said Monday the Sea Systems Command had yet to respond
to those recommendations.
   The inspector general's review was completed in April but did
not become public knowledge until Monday. The Navy declined to
release the document after it was described in the New York Times,
but a copy was obtained from sources.
   The Naval Sea Systems Command is the arm of the Navy responsible
for procuring new ships and their on-board weapon systems.
   The audit results are surfacing two months after the public
disclosure of a long-running Justice Department investigation into
defense procurement fraud. That probe has led to search warrants
aimed at a variety of Defense Department and contractor officials
and outside consultants, although no indictments have been returned
as yet.
   The Justice probe appears to focus on private consultants who
sell their services to military contractors, promising ``inside''
information on the government's procurement plans and the bids of
other firms.
   Private consultants are frequently employed by the military
services as well, however, and the inspector general's report
criticizes the Navy for its reliance on such consultants and the
access to sensitive information they enjoy.
   ``These problems, with their potential for conflict of interest
and misuse of information, suggest the very circumstances involving
consultants ... that appear to be at the very center of the current
procurement fraud investigation,'' asserted Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.,
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.
   The inspector general's report is ``greatly troubling,'' Aspin
added in an Aug. 5 letter to Navy Under Secretary Lawrence Garrett.
   The Navy said in a statement Monday the Sea Systems Command was
``carefully evaluating the recommendations concerning its use of
contractor support services'' and would respond ``through the chain
of command.''
   A Navy official who asked not to be named said, however, the
command had turned to consultants because there were not enough
government employees familiar with the highly technical aspects of
the sophisticated weapons now being purchased.
   Personnel restrictions imposed by Congress and the Office of
Management and Budget in recent years have prevented the command
from hiring more workers itself, the source added.
   Thus consultants have been hired to help the Navy decide what
types of warships it should build; how they should be designed, and
what yards should build them, the official said. Consultants also
are assisting in overseeing contractor performance, the source said.
   ``The Navy does not have any basic factual problems with this
report,'' the source added. ``But given the circumstances, the Sea
Systems Command also doesn't think it had much choice.''

<HEAD>Commission Studying Status of Nagorno-Karabakh</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet commission studying conditions in a
disputed southern region may recommend giving it more autonomy to
help end a standoff between two ethnic groups, a prominent
historian said Monday.
   The commission's work on the status of Nagorno-Karabakh is
connected with preparations for a long-promised plenum of the
Communist Party Central Committee on ethnic relations, said Yevgeny
Ambartsumov.
   Among the compromise solutions the commission is considering is
upgrading the enclave's status from an autonomous region within the
Azerbaijani republic to that of an autonomous republic, which has
its own constitution and laws, he said.
   ``We must find a realistic compromise that would take into
account the aspirations of Armenian people, and the people of
Nagorno-Karabakh, and contribute to better ethnic relations,'' he
said at a government-sponsored news conference.
   He said he did not know when the commission would issue its
report.
   Ambartsumov, a department head at the Soviet Academy of
Sciences' Institute of Economics of the World Socialist System, is
half Armenian. He appeared at a news conference sponsored by the
government news agency Novosti with Azerbaijani writer Chengiz
Guseinov.
   Nagorno-Karabakh is dominated by ethnic Armenians, who have been
agitating since February to have their region taken from Azerbaijan
and annexed to Armenia.
   Demonstrations of hundreds of thousands of people have been held
in Yerevan, the Armenian capital. There have been general strikes
in Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. Ethnic rioting broke out in the
Azerbaijani city Sumgait in early March, killing 32 people, 26 of
them Armenians.
   On July 18, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the nation's
highest executive body, rejected demands to unite Nagorno-Karabakh
with Armenia.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has said that the
policy-making Central Committee should hold a meeting on ethnic
relations, but there has been no indication when it will be.
   Ambartsumov said poor reporting by Soviet media contributed to
the tension in Armenia, portraying Armenians mourning those killed
in Sumgait as extremists and nationalists.
   He called for ``full information, correct information,'' under
Gorbachev's policy of glasnost.
   The situation was quieter but still tense in the southern
republics.
   ``The situation is not very good, but it is more or less quiet
and we have time to start a more profound analysis,'' he said.
   Ambartsumov said Armenians have gained more involvement in the
life of Nagorno-Karabakh. ``In sharp contrast to past developments,
Armenia today is engaged in discussion and solution of the problems
of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is part of Azerbaijan,'' he said.
   Armenian construction workers are building roads and improving
the airport, and food deliveries are being made from Yerevan, he
said.

   President Reagan has directed federal agencies
to develop responses in the event the Soviet Union refuses to tear
down a radar installation considered by the United States to be in
violation of an arms-control treaty.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday that a
third, five-year review of compliance by the superpowers to the
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty will be held in Geneva beginning Aug.
24.
   He said the principal objective of the United States at the
review session is to ``obtain the Soviet Union's agreement to
correct its violations of the ABM treaty and to satisfy other U.S.
concerns regarding Soviet non-compliance with its obligations under
the treaty.''
   Fitzwater, repeating a stand that Reagan and other top officials
have stated in the past, said the Soviet Union's large,
``phased-array radar'' station at Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, ``is a
significant violation'' of a central element of the ABM treaty of
1972.
   ``In preparation for the upcoming review,'' Fitzwater's
statement said, ``the president has issued guidance that the U.S.
delegation should continue to make it clear that the existence of
the Krasnoyarsk radar violation calls into question the viability
of the ABM treaty. ... ''
   ``It should be dismantled without further delay and without
condition,'' the statement said. ``Unless resolved, the Krasnoyarsk
radar violation will force the United States to consider the
exercise of its rights under international law to take appropriate
and proportionate responses.''
   The statement did not define what those responses might entail.
   But it did say that among the options would be for the United
States to declare the Krasnoyarsk radar ``to be a material breach
of the ABM treaty.''
   ``The president also has directed that the Department of
Defense, working with other executive branch agencies and the
Congress, take the lead in developing a range of appropriate and
proportionate responses for consideration if the Soviet Union
continues to refuse to correct the Krasnoyarsk violation,'' the
statement said.
   ``After hearing what the Soviet Union has to say at the
five-year ABM Treaty Review,'' it said, ``should the situation
remain unresolved, the president will consult with the Congress and
our allies concerning next steps.''

   Thousands of Israeli couples were married
Monday on the eighth day of the eighth month of 1988, but some
astrologists said the position of the stars was not lucky for
matrimonial bliss.
   ``We are happy to get married on this date, 8-8-88, because we
become a part of history,'' one bride, identified only as Ayelet,
told Israel radio.
   Her fiance, Shmuel, whose family name was not given, said he
heard ``a lot of astrological talk about this date. If this is
really true, we may be lucky.''
   Another couple, Sarah and Moshe, said they would celebrate by
``having everything in eight: Lighting eight candles and arranging
eight flowers. We shall be happy after getting married on the 8th
day of the eight month, '88.''
   Ayelet and Shmuel had a difficult time reserving a wedding hall,
even for a fee of $9,375 that included the cost of the wedding
dresses, recorded music and fried chicken for the guests, the Al
Hamishmar newspaper reported.
   Reservations for wedding halls, where most Israeli marriage
services are performed, had been streaming in.
   ``Halls throughout the country were booked solid months ago by
couples seeking to take advantage,'' of what the Chinese consider
to be a lucky number, the Jerusalem Post reported.
   Many astrologists said Monday was lucky for marriage.
   ``The convergence of eight, a number that is suffused with life,
creates circumstances ... especially favorable for romantic love by
catalyzing a release of dormant positive energy forces,'' Madame
Sheli, an astrologist told the Jerusalem Post.
   And there were astrologists who said the position of the stars
and the number eight may carry unpleasant surprises.
   ``There's a difficult position of the stars,'' said astrologist
Miriam Binyamini. ``The whole year 1988 is thought to be a hard one
because of the number eight. It's a difficult number. I wouldn't
get married on that day.''
   ``Such a day is good for business, money, sex ... sex by itself,
not accompanied by romantics,'' she told Israel radio. She added:
   ``These couples would have money. But they will have to invest a
great effort in building a happy marriage. I assume today's
marriages would not turn that happy, especially in the area of
simple family relations.''
   One Israeli couple, Yochi and Erez, told Israel radio they
decided to marry on 8-8-88 because ``otherwise we would have to
wait 11 years, till the 9-9-99.''
   ``God forbid!,'' Ms. Binyamini said. ``Then the stars are even
worse.''

   President Reagan intends to elevate William
Barclay Allen to be chairman of the Commission on Civil Rights,
succeeding the late Clarence M. Pendleton Jr., the White House said
Monday.
   Allen has been a member of the commission since 1987 and was a
member of the panel's California Advisory Committee for two years
prior to that.
   He has been a professor of government for the Claremont Graduate
School at Harvey Mudd College in California and is a graduate of
Pepperdine University and Claremont Graduate School.
   Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on
Civil Rights, criticized the selection of Allen.
   ``Regrettably the president has named another right-wing
idealogue as chairman of the civil rights commission,'' Neas said.
``His decision continues to ensure that the commission will lack
any credibility and will remain a joke.''
   The White House also announced that Reagan intends to nominate
Thomas C. Griscom, who recently resigned as White House
communications director, to be a member of the board of the
Communications Satellite Corp., succeeding Neal B. Freeman.
   Griscom would serve on the board of directors until the date of
the annual meeting of Comsat, if confirmed for the position by the
Senate.
   From April 1987 through July of this year, Griscom was assistant
to the president for communications and planning. Before that, he
was president and chief operating officer of Ogilvy and Mather
Public Affairs.

   The official investigation report on last
month's shootdown of an Iranian airliner by a Navy cruiser was
delivered Monday to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm.
William J. Crowe, defense officials said.
   The report by a military board of inquiry was forwarded to Crowe
by Gen. George Crist, the head of the U.S. Central Command, which
is responsible for all U.S. military forces in the Mideast.
   Last week, sources disclosed that investigators had concluded
the USS Vincennes attacked and destroyed an Iranian airliner on
July 3 because of human mistakes made under the stress of combat.
   Because of the mistakes, the captain of the Vincennes believed
his ship had survived its first combat only to confront an
approaching, ``hostile'' Iranian jet fighter, said the sources. In
reality, the radar contact was a civilian airliner with 290 people
aboard that had just taken off from a large military base at Bandar
Abbas, Iran.
   The defense officials said Monday that Crist ``had made some
changes'' and inserted some of his own observations and
recommendations in the inquiry report, which was prepared by Rear
Adm. William Fogarty.
   ``But he made no bottom-line changes,'' added one official, who
like the others demanded anonymity.
   It was not known how long Crowe would take to review the report
and forward it to Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci. The Pentagon
has said it will release an unclassified version of the report
after it reaches Carlucci.

<HEAD>Federal Safety Investigators Call For More Controller Training</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal safety investigators called Monday for
a ``back-to-basics'' training program for air traffic controllers
at Chicago's busy O'Hare International Airport because of an
unusually high number of controller errors.
   The National Transportation Safety Board said that a majority of
the controller errors recorded at O'Hare's radar control facility
during the first six months of the year involved a ``breakdown in
basic (controller) skills.''
   But the safety board said problems at O'Hare, the second busiest
airport in the world with an average of nearly 2,200 takeoffs and
landings a day, go beyond controller skills.
   It called on the FAA to take immediate actions to provide
controllers at O'Hare with newer and better radar and computer
equipment, find ways to increase controller staffing, reduce peak
traffic loads, improve controller training and develop better
quality assurance.
   The FAA declined to comment directly on the NTSB
recommendations, which came out of a special safety board
investigation of O'Hare's air traffic operations because of a
sudden increase in controller errors earlier this year.
   The FAA, however, announced that it planned a special
broad-ranging review of O'Hare by a team of agency and aviation
industry experts with a report to be submitted to FAA Administrator
Allan McArtor by Sept. 20.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said the review will go beyond air
traffic control questions and include an examination of the
airport's overall operation. Participants in the review will
include representatives from the airlines, pilots union, various
aviation organizations and the City of Chicago, Farrar said.
   ``Overall more than 50 organizations have been invited to
participate in the review,'' said Farrar.
   O'Hare Airport is the second busiest in the world with 796,939
arrivals and departures last year, second only to Atlanta's
Hartsfield International. Last year O'Hare handled more than 56
million passengers, more than any other airport.
   It also has been the subject of numerous investigations by the
FAA, the NTSB and congressional committees because of safety
concerns. The latest investigation by the NTSB was prompted by
reports in June that controllers had committed 19 operational
errors where aircraft had been allowed to fly dangerously close to
one another, seven more than during all of 1987.
   After examining these incidents, NTSB investigators concluded
that in many cases ``controllers failed to follow the procedures''
and in a majority of the cases the errors involved a ``breakdown in
basic (air traffic control) skills.''
   The safety board said that in many cases the controllers'
performance was affected by ``excessive workload, lack of
attentiveness, foregetting, perceptual problems, fatigue, and
excessive time on position without a break.''
   But the board said it was ``concerned that these controllers,
working at one of the nation's busiest terminal radar facilities
failed to act in accordance with basic controller standards and
principles'' and questioned the effectiveness of the FAA's overall
quality control program.
   Other areas of NTSB concern at O'Hare were:
   _ Continuing excessive overtime with many controllers saying
they are required to work six-day weeks.
   _ Shortages in the number of controllers. While the FAA has
authorized additional controllers at O'Hare's radar facility, the
number of controllers there actually has increased by only five in
the last two years, investigators said.
   _ The need for newer and better computer, radar and
communications equipment. Some of the equipment has been in use at
other facilities for years, the safety board said. It said that 26
other FAA facilities are currently scheduled to received the FAA's
most advanced terminal radar system before it is scheduled to come
to O'Hare.

   Eight-pound, eight-ounce babies were born Monday, the date of
8-8-88, a bank offered an 88-day certificate of deposit,
mathematicians declaimed on eights and gamblers went eight-ball
wild.
   Kelli-Lee O'Brien was born at 8:08 a.m. Monday in Hackensack,
N.J., at a weight of 8 pounds, 8{ ounces. Her mother's
obstetrician, who was making his eighth delivery in his
two-week-old private practice, has eight children.
   ``It's been hysterical around here all morning,'' said Jean
Werner, head nurse in the labor and delivery unit of Hackensack
Medical Center. ``Everybody can't believe it. Everybody thought
they were joking with all the eights coming up,'' she said.
   Kelli-Lee's parents, Kirsten, 23, and James, 25, of Vernon,
coincidentally gave their daughter a name with eight letters.
   Not to be out-done, William Royal Crowder Jr. weighed 8 pounds,
8 ounces at birth Monday at Richmond, Va. His parents are William
R. and Karen Crowder of Virginia's Dinwiddie County.
   Prince Andrew and the Duchess of York, both 28, had a baby girl
Monday at 8:18 p.m. London time. The child's great-grandmother,
Elizabeth the Queen Mother, last week celebrated her 88th birthday.
   In Roanoke, Va., Helen Canary turned 88 on the day of eights.
``I've seen a whole lot in 88 years, yes,'' Ms. Canary said.
   Tourists descended on tiny Eighty Eight, Ky., and radio stations
called from around the world called residents for interviews.
   Tascosa National Bank in Amarillo, Texas, offered 88-day
personal certificates of deposit at 8[ percent interest. Minimum
deposit? You guessed it: $8,888.
   The eighth day of the eighth month of the 88th year also was the
kick-off day for the centennial anniversary of the American
Mathematical Society based in Providence, R.I.
   In a press release for the weeklong conference, Martin Gardner,
a former columnist for Scientific American magazine, wrote:
   ``Eight is, from a standpoint of pure arithmetic, the second
cube, the sixth Fibonacci number, and the sum of the first three
digits of pi.
   ``Applied to the outside world, eight takes on more glamour as
the notes of an octave, the arms of an octopus, the eight-cylinder
motor, stock market eighths, the figure-8 knot, the skater's figure
8, the eight-hour work day, behind the eight ball, old Spanish
pieces of eight, and the eighth wonder of the world.''
   Monday was the eighth birthday of Stephan Lollar of Burlington,
Vt., so his grandmother, Connie Lollar of Springfield, Mo., sent
him a special eight ball.
   Her late husband, White Sox player Sherm Lollar, hit his 1,000th
major league hit in the eighth inning of a game in 1958 against Red
Sox pitcher Tommy Brewer, then took the ball and painted it black
with a white 8.
   Mrs. Lollar also painted an oversized card for her grandson with
images of crazy eights, arachnids, the semiphore signal for 8 and
an octillion _ a 1 followed by 27 zeros. She also wrote an 88-line
poem in which each line ended with a word rhyming with ``eight.''
   Michigan gamblers also noted the date, triggered higher than
usual sales in both the three-digit and four-digit daily numbers
games, said Bureau of State Lottery spokeswoman Laurie Kipp-Klecha.
By mid-afternoon, more than 10,520 four-digit tickets with the 8888
combination had been sold, she said.
   Connecticut's state lottery sold out the numbers 8888 early
Monday after about 1,600 tickets were sold. ``The computer realized
we had reached $8 million (in potential liability) and sales were
stopped,'' said Ed Harrigan, a spokesman for the state Division of
Special Revenue. That $8 million limit was set earlier and had
nothing to do with the date.
   ``When you get that many numbers, it's a powerful manifestation
... because it's 11 years before it shows up again,'' said Joanne
Benedetto, a numerologist at the Chrystal Cave Bookstore in Orange,
Calif.
   In Europe, throngs of young West German couples rushed to city
registry offices to get married, hoping the date would bring them
luck. Many ceremonies were not preregistered and appeared to be
spur-of-the-moment, including 58 such weddings in Duesseldorf.
   More than 10,000 Germans stormed the northern Bavarian town of
Blindheim to buy stamps bearing the village's postal code: 8888.
   Thousands of Israelis also filled wedding halls. A couple
identified only as Ayelet and Shmuel said they would celebrate
their anniversary by ``having everything in eight: lighting eight
candles and arranging eight flowers.''

<HEAD>Tropical Storm Warnings Expand Over Parts of the Gulf Coast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered across the Southeast on
Monday, with locally heavy rain associated with tropical storm
Beryl, and rain also developed along a line from the Great Lakes to
the Texas Panhandle.
   Tropical storm warnings were expanded to cover the Gulf Coast
from Morgan City, La., to Pensacola, Fla. It had sustained wind
blowing at 45 mph with gusts to 55 mph in squalls over the Gulf of
Mexico.
   Locally heavy rain soaked the central Gulf Coast in association
with Beryl. Valparaiso, Fa., got 2.20 inches of rain in the morning
and Mary Esther, Fla., got 1.45 inches.
   Showers and thunderstorms also developed during the middle of
the day across the southern third of Florida. And showers and
thunderstorms were scattered along the southern Atlantic Coast.
   Showers and thunderstorms developed along a slowly moving cold
front that extended from the north-central Great Lakes through the
lower Missouri Valley into the Texas Panhandle. The front's forward
motion was resisted by very warm, humid air dominating the middle
Mississippi Valley and the southern Plains.
   The cold front helped produce showers and thunderstorms that
brought locally heavy rain to parts of the upper Mississippi
Valley. Eau Claire, Wis., got 1.81 inches of rain from
thunderstorms during the morning and parts of northern Iowa got 1
to 3 inches during the night. Decorah, Iowa, got 2.72 inches and
Rowan, Iowa, got 2.66 inches.
   Elsewhere, showers were scattered over the northern third of New
England during the afternoon. And scattered showers and
thunderstorms developed over the southern high Plains into parts of
central Colorado.
   It was a hot day across parts of the southern Plains and lower
Missouri Valley, with temperatures above 100 degrees from central
Texas through central Oklahoma and across parts of northwestern and
north-central Missouri.
   Kansas City, Mo., hit a record high of 104. In Texas, Dallas and
Fort Worth tied their record of 106 and Corpus Christi tied its
record of 99.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55
degrees at Arcata, Calif., to 106 in Texas at Waco and Dallas-Fort
Worth. The low for Monday morning was 36 at Butte, Mont., and
Truckee, Calif.
   For Tuesday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from the lower Mississippi Valley across the Gulf Coast to the
southern Atlantic Coast and Florida. Scattered showers and
thunderstorms also were forecast from New England through the lower
Great Lakes and middle Mississippi Valley into eastern Kansas.
   Highs in the 70s were predicted along the central and northern
Pacific Coast region and across the upper Great Lakes; from the
upper 90s to 105 from southern Oklahoma through central Texas into
the Rio Grande Valley; between 100 and 110 across the desert
Southwest; and in the 80s or 90s across much of the rest of the
nation.

<HEAD>Detroit Papers To Join 19 Others With Working Agreements</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Detroit will be among 20 cities in which two
newspapers have combined some of their operations to keep one of
the publications alive, according to the American Newspaper
Publishers Association.
   The joint operating agreement between the Detroit Free Press and
the Detroit News, approved Monday by the Justice Department, is the
fifth approved under the Newspaper Preservation Act.
   The law, enacted in 1970, allows a limited antitrust exemption
to preserve independent editorial voices in a community where one
newspaper is in danger of failing.
   Many agreements that had joined the operations of newspapers in
other cities before the law was enacted were grandfathered under
the act and allowed to continue in effect, said Terry Maguire, ANPA
senior vice president and general counsel. Those pre-1970
agreements had been reached by the newspapers themselves without
need of any government action.
   Previous agreements approved under the Newspaper Preservation
Act involved newspapers Anchorage, Alaska, in 1974; Cincinnati in
1979; Chattanooga, Tenn., in 1980 and Seattle in 1982.
   The Anchorage agreement later was dissolved.
   According to Maguire, other joint operating agreements
grandfathered under the act and still in effect involve newspapers
in Albuquerque, N.M.; El Paso, Texas; Nashville, Tenn.; Evansville,
Ind., Tuscon, Ariz.; Tulsa, Okla.; Fort Wayne, Ind.; Birmingham,
Ala.; Salt Lake City; Shreveport La.; Knoxville, Tenn., Charleston,
W.Va.; Pittsburgh; Honolulu; San Francisco; and Miami.
   Other agreements grandfathered under the law but were later
dissolved included those between newspapers in Oil City and
Franklin, Pa.; St. Louis; and Columbus, Ohio, he said.

<HEAD>Two Afghan Airmen Defect To Pakistan in Fighter Plane</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY GANNON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Afghan airmen in a Soviet-built
MiG-19 abandoned a bombing mission over Afghanistan on Monday and
flew their fighter jet to Pakistan, where they asked for political
asylum, authorities said.
   Pakistan officials meanwhile refused to confirm or deny
newspaper accounts that the Islamabad government was holding a
Soviet pilot shot down last week.
   Authorities at the northwest border village of Parachinar said
the two Afghan fliers landed their fully armed plane, handed over
sidearms and asked for asylum.
   They said the men told Parachinar airport security that they,
along with another two fighters, had been sent from Kabul to bomb
Moslem guerrilla positions in eastern Paktia province. While the
others attacked Paktia, the pilot swerved his aircraft toward
Pakistan, they said.
   Airport security fired on the MiG, fearing it was coming in to
bomb the airport although the pilot, identified as Maj. Munir, and
the other airman, Capt. Wazir, advised the control tower they
wanted to defect.
   They circled the airport four times before they were allowed to
land, local authorities said. The fighter was loaded with rockets
and bombs.
   Newspaper reports said a Soviet airman was flown to Islamabad,
the Pakistani capital, after surviving the downing of his Su-20
ground attack fighter by a U.S.-built Pakistan air force F-16 last
Thursday. The plane reportedly was shot down near the border
village of Miranshah.
   Over the course of the 10-year war in neighboring Afghanistan, a
half-dozen Afghan pilots have defected to Pakistan with their
aircraft. This was the first defection reported since the Soviets
began their withdrawal from Afghanistan on May 15.
   Cross-border incursions in Pakistani airspace have occurred
frequently during the long conflict between the Marxist government
in Kabul and Islamic guerrillas.
   An air force official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
``there has been some increase'' since the signing of an April 14
agreement providing for the phased withdrawal of more than 100,000
Soviet soldiers from Afghanistan.
   Guerrilla reports from North Waziristan, where Miranshah is
located, said four Afghan refugees were killed last Wednesday when
a Soviet or Afghan fighter jet bombed Pakistani territory.

   Javier Perez de Cuellar is mild of manner
and would not boast of his diplomatic skill, but he had reason for
pride Monday when he announced a cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war.
   The Iran-Iraq war is the latest in several seemingly intractable
conflicts for which the United Nations has been asked to help find
a solution.
   The Soviet Union is withdrawing its estimated 115,000 soldiers
from a 10-year-old civil war in Afghanistan under a U.N.-mediated
agreement signed April 14.
   Combatants in Cambodia, southwestern Africa and the Western
Sahara have asked the world organization to find ways of ending
their wars without a defeat for any party.
   Perez de Cuellar's diplomatic successes in Afghanistan and the
gulf contrast with his early disappointment in the 74-day Falkland
Islands war between Argentina and Britain. It was fought in 1982,
the year after he became U.N. chief executive.
   The soft-spoken diplomat from Peru, now 68, is known for
discretion and diligence. He likes to quote the French aphorism
``Le ton fait la chanson,'' which means the melody makes the song,
not a loud voice.
   The secretary-general tried to create harmony between Britain
and Argentina as London's fleet of warships steamed toward the
Falklands, but both sides hardened their positions after two weeks
of talks. Argentina also claims the islands, which it calls the
Malvinas.
   Before the Falklands conflict ended, Israel invaded Lebanon. The
Israelis defied Security Council demands for a cease-fire and
withdrawal, and bypassed the 7,000-member U.N. peacekeeping force
in southern Lebanon.
   With infinite patience, Perez de Cuellar insists it is ``much
easier for a government to make concessions to the United Nations
than to make concessions to one another or to a big power.''
   That theory bore fruit in the past week, when Iraq abandoned its
demand for direct talks with Iran as a first step toward peace,
accepting Perez de Cuellar's compromise suggestion for direct talks
immediately after a cease-fire takes effect.
   He announced Monday that the truce would begin Aug. 20 and the
peace talks Aug. 25.
   After he became secretary-general, Perez de Cuellar said he
would not seek a second five-year term because the U.N. chief must
remain independent and not curry favor with the five permanent
Security Council members. He relented, however, and was re-elected
in 1986 with no serious opposition.
   A career diplomat, he was Peru's ambassador to the United
Nations from 1971-75 and served on the Security Council in 1973-74.
   He was U.N. special representative to Cyprus in 1975-77 and, in
1979, was appointed undersecretary-general for political affairs.
He held that post until becoming secretary-general and also was
special representative to Afghanistan in 1981.

   The Duchess of York gave birth Monday to a
daughter, the first child for her and husband Prince Andrew and
fifth in line to the British throne, Buckingham Palace announced.
   The child, who weighed six pounds, 12 ounces, and the mother,
the former Sarah Ferguson, are doing well, the palace said.
   Andrew, Duke of York and second son of Queen Elizabeth II, was
with his wife when she was ``safely delivered of a daughter at 8:18
p.m. (3:18 p.m. EDT) today,'' the palace said.
   In May, Andrew was quoted as saying the child would be named
Annabel.
   ``All members of the royal family are very pleased with the
news,'' a palace spokesman said later. He was not identified, in
keeping with British custom.
   An official notice including the statement was posted on the
gates of Buckingham Palace, also in keeping with royal family
custom, to the cheers of a waiting crowd.
   Dr. Barry Lewis, the family pediatrician, said as he left the
hospital: ``The atmosphere inside was very cheerful. Everyone is
delighted.''
   Town crier Peter Moore, dressed in a red tunic and swinging a
brass hand bell, opened bottles of champagne and announced the
birth to crowds of reporters and members of the public waiting
outside the hospital.
   Andrew left the hospital hours after his daughter's birth,
smiling broadly and waving to the well-wishers as got into a car
and drove away slowly.
   Maj. Ronald Ferguson, father of the duchess, said at his country
home that he was ``absolutely thrilled'' and added: ``If they've
chosen a name, I'm not aware of it.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her husband, Denis,
visiting Bangkok, Thailand, sent congratulations: ``It is wonderful
news and your happiness will be shared by the whole nation.''
   The baby's birth at 18 minutes past 8 p.m. on the eighth day of
the eighth month of 1988 is being taken by well-wishers as a sign
of good fortune. The day is considered highly auspicious by
Cantonese-speaking Chinese, whose word for eight is similar to that
for prosperity.
   Andrew, a Royal Navy lieutenant who returned on Sunday from sea
duty in Singapore to be with his 28-year-old wife, had driven her
to the rear entrance of Portland Hospital from their rented home 21
miles west of London Monday morning.
   The prince, also 28, looked nervous and anxious as left the
hospital after 1{ hours, only to return later _ still looking
worried. The duchess' mother, Susan Barrantes, also joined her at
the hospital, smiling and looking relaxed.
   ``Any Moment Now!'' proclaimed a banner hanging outside the
hospital, where crowds gathered to await the birth of the queen's
fifth grandchild.
   Dozens of photographers who have spent weeks camped outside the
hospital's main entrance missed the arrival of the red-haired
duchess, and the few at the back entrance just caught a glimpse of
her as the car raced by.
   The queen, who was opening a new soap plant at Port Sunlight on
the Wirral in northwest England, joked that the baby was taking a
long time to arrive.
   ``We hope it is soon. We are fed up with waiting,'' she told
young mother Heidi Courtney during a tour of the plant.
   Mrs. Courtney's 22-month-old, curly haired daughter, Carla,
handed a teddy bear to the queen, who said: ``If it is a little
girl, I hope my grandchild has curly hair like this.''
   The baby will be Her Royal Highness, Princess of York. She is
fifth in line to the throne behind Andrew's older brother, Prince
Charles, his two children, Prince William and Prince Harry, and
Andrew himself. The queen's two other grandchildren, Peter and Zara
Phillips, are the children of her only daughter, Anne.
   Millions of TV viewers around the world watched the July 23,
1986, Westminster Abbey wedding of the handsome prince and the
vivacious young working woman he had known since childhood.
   The duchess chose Dr. Anthony Kenney as her obstetrician rather
than the queen's gynecologist, Dr. George Pinker, who has delivered
all royal babies for the past 10 years.
   The duchess also broke tradition by choosing the modern 86-bed
Portland Hospital, which costs $588 a day and is privately owned by
American Medical International. Sarah's sisters-in-law, Anne and
the Princess of Wales, used the private wing of St. Mary's Hospital
in Paddington, a hospital of the government-funded National Health
Service.
   The day after the duchess' pregnancy was announced Jan. 25, she
celebrated by flying a helicopter from a Royal Air Force base in
Oxfordshire.
   The rest of her pregnancy was action-packed, including three
skiing trips. She suffered a fall while on the slopes at Klosters
when she was four months pregnant. On July 8, she escaped injury
when her car collided with an oncoming car on a highway 20 miles
outside London.

<TEXT>
   The five-month writers strike that just ended
will push back NBC's mid-season replacements a month or so, but
otherwise the network is in good shape for the fall, NBC
Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff said Monday.
   NBC will have two weeks of prime-time coverage of the Summer
Olympics beginning Sept. 15. That made the network less vulnerable
to delays in the new season of entertainment shows caused by the
strike, but had threatened to devalue the promotional platform
afforded by the multimillion-dollar Olympics coverage.
   ``We've had a lot of time to sort of digest what was happening
and prepare for the day when it (the strike) would be over,''
Tartikoff told a news conference, though he added, ``I would say
nobody's in fighting form.''
   Most of NBC's schedule will premiere in October. Three shows
that make up the Tuesday lineup, ``Matlock,'' ``In the Heat of the
Night'' and ``Midnight Caller,'' will be delayed until the end of
November because of ABC's airing of its miniseries ``War and
Remembrance'' that month, not directly because of the strike,
Tartikoff said.
   Premiering the week of Oct. 3 will be ``ALF,'' ``The Hogan
Family,'' ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' ``Highway to Heaven,'' ``The
Cosby Show,'' ``A Different World,'' ``Dear John,'' ``Sonny
Spoon,'' ``227,'' ``Amen,'' ``Golden Girls,'' ``Empty Nest'' and
``The Magical World of Disney.''
   The week of Oct. 24 will have ``Tattinger's,'' ``Something Is
Out There,'' ``Hunter,'' ``Family Ties'' and ``Day by Day.'' The
next week, NBC will add ``Baby Boom,'' ``Night Court,'' ``Cheers,''
``L.A. Law'' and ``Miami Vice.''
   ``It's not going to be our tack to rush shows on the air,
particularly the new ones, and diminish the possibility for
long-term success to get on one week early,'' Tartikoff said.
   ``We were prepared and we did give script orders early enough so
they could be meaningful at this time. I think that's why we're
getting on sooner'' than the other two networks, he said.
   Besides the Olympics, NBC also had several series, including its
top-rated ``The Cosby Show,'' that were able to stay in production
under independent contracts with the Writers Guild.
   ``Mid-season might come after the February sweeps,'' a delay of
about a month, Tartikoff said.
   ``Hardy Boys,'' a remake considered during the strike, will be
made as a two-hour movie, but NBC has no series commitment.
   The extensive research the network did in looking for old shows
to re-shoot was not an exercise in futility, Tartikoff said.
   ``We did the entire history of television in a seven-week
period,'' he said. ``The one thing you realize when you go back is
that television at one time was a much more varied marketplace, and
there were a lot more interesting ideas out there than are the
tableaux today. Out of that there have been some ideas and
offshoots'' that could become the germs of new series ideas.
   Tartikoff also announced that NBC has struck a deal with the
network's former president, Grant Tinker, who now heads GTG
Entertainment, for a two-hour pilot called ``Bay Watch.'' It would
hit the air in the fall of 1989.
   Tinker currently is producing two shows for CBS.

<HEAD>British Actor Alan Napier Of `Batman' Fame Dead At 85</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British actor Alan Napier, whose
butler character tidied up the Bat Cave but never divulged his
master's identity in the 1960s ``Batman'' television series, died
Monday at the age of 85.
   Napier died at the Berkley East Convalescent Hospital in Santa
Monica, where he had been living since June, said nursing
supervisor Naseem Chunara. He suffered a stroke last year and had
been ill for several days, she said.
   In a career that spanned four decades, the tall, elegant
Englishman appeared in more than 50 films, including ``My Fair
Lady,'' ``Tender is the Night,'' and ``Journey to the Center of the
Earth.''
   His best-remembered role, however, was Alfred Pennyworth,
Batman's trusted servant in the television series.
   The ``Batman'' series, based on the comic strip, achieved
enormous popularity during its short run from January 1966 to March
1968 with its campy dialogue and celebrity villains.
   Adam West played the Caped Crusader and Burt Ward was his
sidekick Robin, the Boy Wonder. Guest villains included Burgess
Meredith as the Penquin, Cesar Romero as the Joker, Vincent Price
as Egghead and the late Victor Buono as King Tut.
   Batman's cover identity was that of millionaire Bruce Wayne.
Pennyworth worked in both the above-ground Wayne mansion and in the
Bat Cave crime lab, where his duties included dusting the Bat
Computer.
   Born Alan Napier-Clavering in Birmingham, England, his other
films included ``We Are Not Alone,'' 1939; ``The Invisible Man
Returns,'' 1940; ``The House of the Seven Gables,'' 1940; ``The
Song of Bernadette,'' 1943; ``Cat People,'' 1942; ``Lassie Come
Home,'' 1943; ``Forever Amber,'' 1947.
   He also appeared as the Earl of Warwick in ``Joan of Arc'' in
1948 and portrayed Cicero in ``Julius Caesar'' in 1953.
   Funeral arrangements are pending at Pierce Brothers Mortuary in
Westwood Village.

<HEAD>Final Qualifying Test Of Redesigned Shuttle Booster Set For Aug.

<HEAD>With AM-Space Shuttle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRIGHAM CITY, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last of five full-scale
test-firings required to qualify the redesigned space shuttle
booster rocket for flight is scheduled for Aug. 18, Morton Thiokol
Inc. announced Monday.
   A successful test of the 126-foot-long rocket at the aerospace
company's northern Utah plant 25 miles west of here would clear the
way for resumption of shuttle flights, on hold since the Jan. 28,
1986, Challenger disaster.
   A faulty seal between sections of one of Challenger's two
boosters was blamed by a presidential commission for the explosion
that destroyed the spacecraft shortly after launch.
   Morton Thiokol spokesman Rocky Raab said next week's test,
following the successful fourth firing on June 14, will incorporate
several intentional flaws to test backup systems to their limits.
   ``It's severely flawed. It has flaws in every joint but one. Two
of the three field joints and the case-to-nozzle joint are
flawed,'' he said.
   ``We have already tested full-sized motors in short duration
tests with these same types of flaws. This test will allow us to
demonstrate that with a full-duration test, further adding to the
confidence in the redesign,'' Raab added.
   The two-minute test will burn approximately 1.1 million pounds
of solid fuel propellant, sending a cloud of smoke and flame
thousands of feet into the sky.
   The redesigned rocket developed by Morton Thiokol to replace
Challenger-era boosters incorporates new and additional O-ring
seals made of cold-resistant materials, as well as improved
insulation intended to further reduce the possibility of flaming
exhaust gases leaking through a joint rather than the rocket motor.
   Such a leak ignited Challenger's exterior liquid fuel tank.

<HEAD>Three More Children Won't Testify In McMartin Pre-School Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three children have refused to testify in the
McMartin Pre-School molestation trial, a prosecutor said Monday,
placing in jeopardy 27 of the 99 molestation charges against the
school's operators.
   Deputy District Attorney Lael Rubin said outside court that the
prosecution might try to prove the charges without the three
children, ``but it's an extraordinarily difficult thing to do.''
   She said the children have refused to testify because they don't
want to revive painful memories and because they remain
traumatized. Two boys, she said, continue to have ``strong
nightmares,'' and one girl has lost her memory of all events prior
to a year ago _ a sign of ``massive depression.''
   ``While we have a responsiblity to present all of the evidence,
we also have a responsiblity not to increase trauma to kids,'' Ms.
Rubin told reporters of the decision not to force the children into
court.
   Another child refused to testify last month, and the judge
refused a prosecution bid to use her videotaped preliminary hearing
testimony from 1985. Three charges were based on her allegations.
   Raymond Buckey, 30, and Peggy McMartin Buckey, 61, are charged
with 99 molestations and one joint count of conspiracy with 82 of
the counts naming only Buckey. The molestations allegedly took
place at their now-defunct McMartin Pre-School in suburban
Manhattan Beach.
   The case has been in Los Angeles courts for five years, and the
trial has been under way for more than a year. Nine children have
testified so far in the case, which once focused on 41 youngsters.
   With 30 charges resting on four children who will not testify,
the prosecution stands to lose nearly a third of the charges to
dismissal if the judge finds insufficient evidence to support them.
   Buckey's attorney, Danny Davis, said outside court he was not
surprised at the development and had suspected earlier that the
prosecution would drop some of the child witnesses.
   ``The remaining three witnesses had more contradictions and
unbelievable accounts (in their testimony),'' he said. ``They were
a liablity (to the prosecution.)
   ``I think the prosecution case is falling of its own weight.''
   Davis said he would vigorously oppose any effort to have the
children's parents testify instead of the alleged victims.
   Prosecutors dropped charges against five other teachers at the
school in 1986.

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
announced Monday that Iran and Iraq will begin a cease-fire in
their 8-year-old war on Aug. 20 and will open peace negotitions
five days later in Geneva.
   ``The restoration of peace will bring to the peoples of both
countries victories far greater than those of war,'' he said in a
statement, capping a full year of U.N. peace efforts and three
weeks of intense, delicate diplomacy.
   The Persian Gulf war killed or wounded more than 1 million
people and cost hundreds of billions of dollars.
   The U.N. chief told the 15-nation Security Council the two sides
would begin direct talks on a comprehensive peace settlement Aug.
25 in Geneva. He said he would preside and the level of the talks
was to be decided.
   ``I now call upon the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic
of Iraq to observe a cease-fire and to discontinue all military
action on land, at sea and in the air as of 0300 GMT on 20 August
1988,'' he said in his statement.
   The starting time of 3 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time Aug. 20 is 11
p.m. EDT Aug. 19.
   ``I have been assured by the two parties to the conflict that
they will observe this cease-fire in the context of the full
implementation of Resolution 598,'' a peace plan adopted by the
Security Council more than a year ago.
   As he spoke, the envoys of Iran and Iraq were both present in
the Security Council for the first time since the war started. But
Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati and Iraqi Ambassador
Ismat Kittani did not acknowledge each other's presence.
   The council will meet Tuesday to authorize a 350-man unarmed
U.N. peace-keeping force, including a naval contingent, to monitor
the cease-fire and troop withdrawal.
   Perez de Cuellar did not announce dates for all peace plan
elements, including troop withdrawal, prisoner exchange, direct
peace talks and an investigation into which side started the war.
   The agreement is the second U.N. negotiating success this year.
Moscow is withdrawing Soviet soldiers from Afghanistan under a
U.N.-mediated agreement signed April 14.
   ``This is not a personal success for me,'' Perez de Cuellar said
later in answer to reporters' questions. ``It is a success for the
two parties, for the Security Council, for the U.N. organization.''
   Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, later told a news
conference:
   ``I wish to declare my government is prepared to accept the
demand of the secretary-general and that of the entire world
community to refrain from any military action on land, sea and air,
starting today.''
   ``Let me express my sincere hope that today's historic
announcement will be the first step in the implementation of all
provisions of Resolution 598, and the achievement of a just,
comprehensive and honorable setttlement, returning peace and
stability to all the region.'' .
   Asked if Iran was ready to make peace with Iraq, he said: ``Of
course, there is no question about it.''
   Iraq's Kittani told reporters: ``This is a happy day. I don't
think anyone is unhappy. We in Iraq have been waiting for this day
...
   ``Now we begin the arduous but happy march that begins from
here. I am sure it will not be a smooth road, but it will be much
more pleasant than fighting and bloodshed.''
   U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters told reporters: ``This is a
historic date for the participating countries, a historic day for
the United States which has pressed so hard to bring this war to
and end, and a truly historic day for the United Nations.''
   Iraq had foreign exchange reserves of $35 billion when the war
began and now owes an estimated $60 billion. Iran has not borrowed,
but its foreign exchange reserves have declined to a few billion
dollars.
   A financial journal published in Paris, La Tribune, estimates
Iran needs $80 billion and Iraq $30 billion to rebuild
transportation, oil installations, housing, factories, schools and
hospitals.
   U.N. negotiations had been deadlocked over Iraq's demand for
direct talks with Iran before a cease-fire. Iran had rejected that
demand, saying it wanted a truce first, then direct talks. Perez de
Cuellar proposed a compromise formula that includes direct talks
immediately after a cease-fire.
   People in Tehran seemed convinced Monday the fighting would end.
   A 25-year-old man named Fahrad said he was excused from military
service because of injuries suffered in a car crash while studying
petrochemical engineering in Los Angeles.
   He told an Associated Press reporter: ``Many of my generation
are dead. In a way I was lucky to have been in that accident.''
   Diplomats in Baghdad said efforts to keep the guns silent may
continue for years because of border and other issues.
   Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after border skirmishes.
   President Reagan said: ``We may finally see an end to that long
and bloody war. ... I applaud and encourage the efforts of
Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar.''
   About two weeks will be needed to deploy the peacekeepers and
their operation will cost $74 million for the six months
authorized. They will be drawn from about 25 nations, each paying
for the soldiers it sends.
   A report by Perez de Cuellar said the U.N. Iran-Iraq Military
Observer Group will:
   _Establish agreed cease-fire lines on the basis of forward
defended areas existing when the truce begins, with adjustments
when the sides are too close.
   _Monitor compliance with the cease-fire.
   _Investigate alleged violations and restore the situation in
each case.
   _Use negotiations to prevent changes in the status quo pending
withdrawal to internationally recognized boundaries.
   _Supervise, verify and confirm withdrawal.
   _Obtain agreement on other arrangements, such as weapons
limitations near the border and patrolling of sensitive areas by
U.N. naval personnel.

<HEAD>Scientists Announce Discovery of Most Distant Galaxy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Astronomers on Monday announced the discovery
of the most distant galaxy known, a cluster of stars 15 billion
light years away that formed long before the Earth and the sun.
   ``This is very unusual and very rare,'' said Ken Chambers of
Johns Hopkins University, one of the co-discovers. ``We're seeing
something from before the Earth formed, possibly before our own
galaxy, and when the universe was very different than today.''
   The distant galaxy, known as 4C41.17, is far too faint to be
seen by the eye, but it emits a radio signal a billion times more
powerful than the sun's radio signal.
   ``It is one of the most powerful radio galaxies we know of,''
said Chambers.
   Though the galaxy was located by radio signals, its distance
from Earth was established by analyzing the optical spectrum, or
type of light, put out by the galaxy.
   Chambers said the galaxy puts out a sharp optical signal of the
type characteristic of hydrogen and carbon. The wavelength of the
emission, however, is stretched by movement away from the observer.
   This stretch causes the light color to shift toward red, the
so-called ``red shift.'' By measuring this shift, the astronomers
could calculate the distance of the galaxy.
   A red shift of 3.8 found for 4C41.17 shows that it is about 15
billion light years away. A light year is the distance light
travels in a year, about 5.8 trillion miles.
   Chambers said at 15 billion light years, the galaxy is about 90
percent of the distance to what is thought to be the edge of the
universe. He said it also gives a view back in time and the galaxy
as seen now is only few billion years after the Big Bang, the
massive explosion that is thought to have started the universe
expanding outward.
   The galaxy is thought to be ``primitive,'' or in an early stage
of formation, Chambers said.
   ``To be able to study the dynamics as it is forming will tell us
a lot of how galaxies are formed,'' he said.
   The Earth and sun are thought to have formed about 4.6 billion
years ago.
   The study of the distant galaxy was announced at the 20th
assembly of the International Astronomical Union. Chambers'
co-discovers were George Miley, a European Space Agency
representative at the Space Telescope Science Institute, and Wil
van Bruegel, an astronomer at the University of California,
Berkeley.

   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said
Monday that Pakistan is continuing ``destructive actions'' in
violation of the pact intended to end the war in Afghanisan.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said Shevardnadze made
the comment during a meeting at the Foreign Ministry with U.S.
Ambassador Jack Matlock.
   Shevardnadze returned Sunday from a four-day visit to
Afghanistan and Tass said Matlock requested the meeting.
   While in Kabul, the Afghan capital, Shevardnadze and Afghan
officials said Pakistan was continuing to supply weapons to the
rebels fighting Afghanistan's Marxist government.
   The Soviet Union sent troops into Afghanistan in December 1979
to help the government fight the anti-communist rebels. Under
Geneva accords signed April 14 by Pakistan and Afghanistan, with
the Soviet Union and the United States as guarantors, the Soviets
are to withdraw all of their military units by Feb. 15.
   It was estimated that the Soviets had about 120,000 military
personnel in Afghanistan when the withdrawal began May 15. The pact
called for half the Soviet forces to be out of the country by Aug.
15
   Tass reported that Shevardnadze, in his talks with Matlock,
``corroborated the viewpoint that an obvious imbalance emerged in
the Afghan settlement.''
   It quoted him as saying, ``At a time when the Afghan government
and the Soviet Union consistently adhered to the course toward
implementing in full the Geneva agreements, Pakistan continued
destructive actions.''
   Shevardnadze also said the United States, as a guarantor, has an
obligation to ensure ``the letter and the spirit'' of the pact,
according to Tass.
   It said Matlock delivered a letter to the foreign minister from
Secretary of State George P. Shultz, but said nothing about the
contents.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Richard Gilbert declined to comment about
the letter.
   Shevardnadze told reporters in Kabul Sunday that the Soviet
withdrawal would would proceed on schedule despite the Pakistani
``infractions.''
   He said the Soviet troops would be out of 25 of Afghanistan's 30
provinces soon, and half of the force would be out as promised by
Aug. 15.
   Shevardnadze did not specify the five provinces where Soviet
troops would remain for some time. Afghan officials earlier this
year announced formation of a special northern zone, where the bulk
of the nation's natural resources are located, and it is believed
the government is establishing a stronghold.

<HEAD>House OKs Bill To Combat Illegal Ivory Imports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Monday passed legislation to
combat illegal trafficking in African elephant ivory.
   Sent to the Senate by voice vote, the measure would prohibit
imports into this country of any ivory taken in violation of the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.
   That worldwide agreement uses a system of quotas and ivory
markings in an effort to regulate the international trade in ivory
from African elephants, whose numbers have fallen to an estimated
700,000 from 1.5 million in 1979.
   The bill would ban importation of raw ivory from any nation
without a native elephant population and would prohibit exportation
of raw ivory from the United States.
   The legislation would require the Interior Department to license
all U.S. commercial importers and exporters of ivory and to declare
moratoria on ivory imports from nations lacking adequate elephant
protection programs.
   The department would have to do a country-by-country review of
the programs and decide by Dec. 31, 1989, whether a particular
nation's preservation efforts are adequate.
   Violations of the proposed law would carry a maximum civil
penalty of $5,000 and a maximum criminal penalty of a $200,000 fine
and a year in prison.

   Republican support for a Democratic Contra aid
plan collapsed Monday after GOP senators and leaders of the
Nicaraguan rebels denounced it and White House officials said it
might prove impossible to implement.
   Following an hour-long private meeting to discuss the Democratic
attempt to forge a bipartisan Contra-aid policy, many Republicans
emerged to criticize the effort, some calling it an attempt to
provide political cover for opponents of Contra aid.
   ``The Democratic plan is unsatisfactory,'' said Sen. Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C. ``I hope they will change their minds and do what
has to be done.''
   ``They know that it won't work or they wouldn't be supporting
it,'' Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said of the Democrats. He
complained that many of the Democrats who have added their support
to the compromise effort are long-time opponents of arming the
Contra rebels to fight Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who took part in the initial
negotiations last week, told reporters: ``Negotiations are over
with. I don't think there is any more room. We've gone as far as we
can go.''
   He predicted Democrats will hold together on the issue, and he
dismissed the GOP complaints, saying `` They really don't have a
leg to stand on, substantively.''
   Despite the rancor, Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas
said he would take ``one last shot'' at meeting his colleagues'
objections to the proposal.
   And Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., the chief architect
of the Democratic Contra-aid package, said discussions had resumed
between the White House and Dole's office and told his colleagues:
``I still hope that we can have the co-sponsorship of my amendment
by Mr. Dole and others on the Republican side. I would like to have
an action by the Senate that is strongly bipartisan.''
   Dole said that in the hours after the breakup of the GOP
senators' meeting some progress at compromise had been made.
   But he added: ``I wouldn't want to be overly optimistic.''
   Sources inside the meeting said Colin Powell, President Reagan's
national security adviser, reported that representatives of the
government agencies that would have to implement the plan told him
it does not provide sufficient funds to do the job.
   Powell told reporters on Friday that he thought progress had
been made in working out an acceptable package but a source quoted
him as telling the GOP senators that the White House now has
serious reservations about it.
   ``He said, ``We cannot implement it. We've talked with the
people who would have to implement it and it cannot be done,'''
according to the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   They also said Contra leaders contacted the White House and
several GOP senators Monday morning to declare their unanimous
opposition to the plan. They quoted them as saying they would
rather risk getting no aid at all than to accept restrictions
drafted by the Democrats.
   Bosco Matamoros, a spokesman for the Contra resistance forces,
told the Associated Press that Contra leaders see the Democratic
plan as unacceptable and resulting from ``internal politics in the
United States which basically seek to reward (Nicaraguan President)
Daniel Ortega for not complying with the commitments of the peace
process.''
   ``This new legislation will only increase the pressures on the
resistance which brought the Sandinistas to the negotiating
table,'' Matamoros said. ``It will place the option on us to
surrender or become refugees.''
   Virtually all Senate Democrats had endorsed the compromise
drafted late last week by Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd,
D-W.Va., Dole and a handful of other leaders of both parties.
   The Democratic plan would permit $27.1 million in immediate
non-lethal ``humanitarian'' logistical aid to the Contras.
   But it also would give Reagan an opportunity to ask Congress in
September or October to release some $16.3 million in previously
purchased arms, ammunition and other military supplies now stored
in warehouses in Central America.
   Byrd and House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, promised Republican
leaders last week that they would bring a military aid proposal to
a prompt vote in both houses of Congress if Reagan certifies that
Nicaragua has disrupted the ``peace and stability'' of Central
America by taking two of three possible actions.
   The three include: an unprovoked military attack on the Contras;
continued ``blatant violations'' of the regional peace plan; and
continued ``unacceptable levels of military assistance by
Soviet-bloc countries, including Cuba.''
   But several Republicans emerging from the meeting, most of them
Contra supporters, said the plan is fatally flawed.
   Stevens said a chief objection is that there is no effective
method of getting the military supplies to the Contras inside
Nicaragua from the warehouses in Honduras.
   ``They would have to come out of Nicaragua to pick it up in
Honduras,'' Stevens said. ``That won't work.''
   Some senators also complained that the Democratic plan bars U.S.
intelligence agencies and the Pentagon from delivering military aid
to the Contras, saying that because deliveries must be made in the
face of the Sandinista armed forces, those are the only agencies
equipped to do the job.
   Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho, said the Democratic plan is intended
merely to provide political insurance for Contra-aid opponents.
   ``We shouldn't give cover to the people who have been trying to
destroy the freedom fighters for their entire careers in the
Senate,'' Symms said. ``It's just a political cover for people to
use so they can say they are for Contra aid when in reality it's a
death knell for the Contras.''
   He said there was an apparent consensus inside the meeting that
Republicans should seek a vote on a proposal drafted earlier by
Dole that would not only provide ``humanitarian'' aid for the
Contras and a vote on releasing the stored arms already approved
but would provide $20 million in new military aid as well.
   If the Byrd plan were adopted it could defuse a potential
embarrassment for the Democrats whose presidential candidate,
Michael Dukakis, has opposed military aid to the Contras while his
running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, has voted for it in the
past.

   The House approved legislation Monday to
temporarily bar the Reagan administration from carrying out a plan
to require shrimp fishermen to use devices to protect endangered
and threatened sea turtles.
   The bill, sent to the Senate by voice vote, would prohibit
making the devices mandatory before Sept. 30, a month after such
regulations are slated to take effect.
   The delay is to allow House and Senate negotiators time to work
out differences in their versions of legislation to reauthorize the
Endangered Species Act.
   Both bills would prohibit requiring the devices in inshore
waters until May 1990. The Senate bill also would ban device
regulations for offshore waters until next May.
   Turtles often drown when snared in shrimp nets.

<HEAD>Henri Frenay, Major Figure In French Resistance, 82</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Henri Frenay, a professional soldier who became a
major figure in the French Resistance during the Nazi occupation of
France in World War II, died at the age of 82, family members said
Monday.
   Frenay died Saturday in Porte-Vecchio on the French
Mediterranean island of Corsica, the home of his wife, Chilina, and
was buried there Sunday, Le Monde newspaper reported. Cause of
death was not given.
   His only child, Henri, said in a statement that a Mass would be
celebrated in Paris at a date to be announced later. On Monday
night, the presidential palace said in a statement that President
Francois Mitterrand would attend the ceremony and ``would hope the
nation renders a solemn homage to Henri Frenay.''
   Last March, Mitterrand, himself a Resistance figure, awarded
Frenay the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor, calling him ``the
incarnation of the young, interior Resistance.''
   Frenay _ known by the pseudonym Charvet _ founded the Secret
Army during the occupation, the Resistance group Combat, and the
underground Resistance newspaper of the same name.
   Born Nov. 19, 1905 in Lyon, Frenay was educated at France's
military academy, St. Cyr. A captain when Germany invaded France in
May 1940, Frenay was captured the following month, but escaped. He
returned to Lyon where he at once began organizing resistance
against the Germans.
   After the Liberation, he served in the provisional governments
of 1944 and 1945 as minister for prisoners, deportees and refugees.
   He was promoted to colonel in 1945.
   Frenay wrote several books on the Resistance, including ``La
Nuit Finira'' (The Night Will End), published in 1974;
``Volontaires de la Nuit'' (Volunteers of the Night) 1975, and
``L'Enigme Jean Moulin'' (The Jean Moulin Riddle) 1977.
   His vision of his mission differed from that of Gen. Charles de
Gaulle, who wanted all resistance groups to work under the umbrella
of his London-based leadership.
   ``Well, Charvet, France will choose between you and me,''
Frenay, quoting de Gaulle, recounted in his book ``La Nuit Finira.''
   In the 1965 presidential election, Frenay called for a vote
against de Gaulle, who he said represented a ``haughty and obsolete
nationalism.''
   After the war, Frenay became administrator of a toy company.

   Proponents of making English the
state's official language got enough signatures with one day to
spare to put their proposed constitutional amendment before the
voters.
   The group, Florida English, thought it had enough signatures to
get the issue on the November ballot, but last Tuesday learned it
was 930 short.
   ``They have made it,'' Ethel Baxter, assistant director of the
division of elections, said Monday afteroon.
   The deadline was Tuesday at 5 p.m.
   ``Now that it's on the ballot, we think it will pass
overwhelmingly,'' said Pat Fulton, a spokeswoman for Florida
English.
   ``We still have more work ahead of us,'' Fulton said in a
telephone interview from Miami. ``We overcame some odds _ you know,
the last minute numbers problem.''
   The referendum would ask voters to designate English as the
official language, but would leave it up to the state Legislature
to decide what, if any, government practices would be changed.
   In June, a group called English Plus, launched a campaign
against the constitutional amendment, saying the law is
discriminatory and could cripple business and tourism in a state
with strong ties to Latin America.
   Signatures of 8 percent of the Floridians who voted in the last
general election are needed to get an amendment on the ballot by
initiative. Besides that statewide requirement of 342,939 names,
the 8 percent minimum must be met in 10 of the state's 19
congressional districts, which was what gave Florida English some
trouble.
   The group collected 5,273 signatures to make up for the
signature shortage in three days, Fulton said.

   A fire alarm went off when a fatal blaze
broke out at a retirement home, but an employee turned it off
because residents previously had activated the alarm as a prank,
police said Monday.
   One resident, Howard Sheder, 74, died in Sunday's fire at the
Golden Age Retirement Home and 17 other residents were taken to
hospitals, mainly for treatment of smoke inhalation. Four rescue
workers and a man who aided them also were treated for smoke
inhalation and exhaustion.
   The fire may have been caused by someone smoking in a room, said
Cherian Samuel, owner of the 23-resident home in this Fort
Lauderdale suburb. The official cause of the fire was still
uncertain, police spokesman Ed Plaisted said, however.
   The facility has smoke detectors and passed a fire department
inspection in March 1988, Plaisted said.
   But when a detector went off, the employee ``turned it off
thinking (the residents) were playing with it. Some people in the
neighborhood spotted the fire and called it in,'' Plaisted said.
   The quick work of two police officers in the area when the call
came in and a civilian who aided them saved lives in the nursing
home as thick, black smoke swept through it, the spokesman said.
   ``They went in there with reckless abandon, kicking open bedroom
doors,'' he said.
   Damage to the one-story structure was not heavy; no official
damage estimate was released.
   ``I think it's a tragedy because one loss of life occurred,''
Fire Chief Robert Pudney said, ``but it could have been worse.''
   The blaze was put out within 11 minutes, he said.
   Samuel said the fire began in Sheder's room. He said Sheder had
been warned not to smoke in his room.

<HEAD>House Bill Prohibits Converting Local Contributions To National
Use</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House approved legislation Monday to
prohibit political contributions for state and local campaigns from
being used for a federal race _ a step critics say amounts to
protection for members of Congress.
   The bill was sent to the Senate by voice vote.
   However, several members disputed criticism voiced by Fred
Wertheimer, president of the self-described citizens lobby Common
Cause.
   Current election law permits some money raised for state or
local races to be used in a campaign for Congress so long as the
candidate did not violate any federal restrictions on the sources
or amounts of contributions.
   In a letter last week to House members, Wertheimer said that
with the proposed law ``incumbent members of Congress would be
making it far more difficult for a state or local official to
challenge a sitting member of Congress.''
   ``Members of Congress could continue, as they now do, to raise
re-election campaign funds throughout their term while preventing
challengers from using any money that may have been raised prior to
declaring for federal office, even though that money meets
contribution limits in federal law,'' he wrote.
   Wertheimer noted that the bill by Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif.,
``does not provide a similar prohibition on House members using
money raised for House races to run for the Senate.''
   The bill's floor manager, Rep. Al Swift, D-Wash., said the
proposal is intended to ``close a loophole'' in campaign law
created by a ruling by the Federal Elections Commission.
   Swift said the ruling, for example, allows a state official to
use contributions from corporations _ illegal for federal offices _
to cover some expenses connected with raising money for a
congressional race.
   Wertheimer also criticized Swift and other members of the House
Administration Committee for failing to produce ``a single piece of
meaningful campaign finance reform legislation'' in recent years.
   Swift said, however, that the panel won't propose any major
reform package until the Senate first passes one. Senate Democrats
ran into paralyzing Republican filibusters in 1987 and 1988 when
they tried to move a bill setting up spending limits for Senate
races.

<HEAD>Nicaraguan Leader Visits Noriega, Criticizes `Imperialist
Policies'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua
and Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the boss of Panama, declared
Monday that both their countries are victims of U.S. imperialist
policies.
   Noriega, who is under federal U.S. indictment on drug
trafficking charges, welcomed Ortega personally when the Nicaraguan
leader arrived at a military air base for an unannounced three-day
official visit.
   Ortega said his trip was a gesture of solidarity with Panama.
   ``We are here to emphasize the gratitude of the Nicaraguan
people to the people of Panama, who like the Nicaraguan people are
under attack by imperialist policies'' of the United States, Ortega
said in a brief statement to reporters.
   ``We are also here to ratify the friendly relations existing
between the people and government of Nicaragua and the people and
government of Panama.'' Noriega said Ortega's visit ``shows the
points of agreement that exist among peoples who are the object of
aggression.''
   When pressed to explain, Noriega replied: ``Those of the empire
against the weak ones.''
   The Reagan administration supports rebels who have fought since
1981 to overthrow Ortega's leftist Sandinista government.
Washington also has tried economic and diplomatic means in the past
year to force Noriega out as head of the 15,000-member Panamanian
Defense Forces, the position from which he runs the country.
   A federal grand jury in Florida indicted Noriega last February
on drug smuggling charges. Noriega has denied the accusations.
   Last week Secretary of State George P. Shultz tried
unsuccessfully to get the foreign ministers of El Salvador,
Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala to issue a joint declaration
accusing Nicaragua of not living up to a Central American peace
agreement signed Aug. 7, 1987.
   Nicaragua was not invited to the Aug. 1 meeting of Shultz and
the Central American foreign ministers in Guatemala City. Shultz
now is on a Latin American tour and has scheduled meetings Tuesday
with the chief executives of Honduras, Costa Rica and El Salvador.
   He then will travel to the inauguration Wednesday of Ecuador's
left-leaning President-elect Rodrigo Borja, which President Fidel
Castro of Cuba also plans to attend.
   Ortega also had planned to attend Borja's inauguration but then
postponed his trip to Ecuador by one day.
   Nicaraguan officials in Panama said he plans to arrive in Quito,
capital of Ecuador, on Thursday. They did not explain the change in
plans.
   Borja's predecessor, President Leon Febres Cordero, broke
diplomatic relations with Nicaragua in 1985 after Ortega made a
remark Febres considered offensive. Borja promised he would
re-establish relations with the Sandinistas the day after he was
sworn in.
   Asked by reporters to comment on Shultz's activities in Central
America, Ortega said it was the secretary's purpose ``to weaken the
unity so necessary among Latin American nations to defend their
common interests.''

   Attorneys for PTL founder Jim Bakker have
protested the sale of his deposition transcript to a newspaper and
asked a bankruptcy judge to keep future depositions secret, one of
his lawyers said Monday.
   The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer on Wednesday published excerpts of
Bakker's sworn statements to attorneys.
   In the Observer story, Bakker said he believed thousands of
internal PTL documents had been destroyed since he resigned as
president in March 1987 in a sex and money scandal. Ministry
officials have denied that.
   The ministry has been in Chapter 11 reorganization proceedings
since June 1987 and must sell off assets to pay debts.
   Bakker attorneys Ryan Hovis and James Toms won a court order
Thursday to protect the defrocked minister from the release of
further transcripts. The Observer had purchased the documents from
the court reporter transcribing Bakker's deposition.
   Toms said the Observer obtained about half of 20 hours of
deposition given by Bakker so far and that about five more hours of
testimony is yet to be given.
   In his ruling, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds ordered the
transcript sealed and filed with the court clerk at the federal
courthouse in Columbia.
   He noted that neither Bakker nor his attorneys had reviewed the
transcripts before their sale.
   The court reporter told Toms she released the transcript after
getting permission from the bankruptcy trustee's attorney, Toms'
motion said.
   The lawyer said Monday he thought it unfair to Bakker to release
the transcripts piecemeal and before they had properly entered
court.
   ``If you release portions of it, you're releasing it in
fragments, for one thing, before the whole story is told,'' he said
from his office in Hendersonville, N.C.
   On Friday, Bakker's attorneys asked Reynolds to clarify his
position on release of depositions before the process continues.
   ``We're going to basically ask him to say he meant what he
said,'' Toms said Monday.
   The Observer said it plans to protest the order, but it is not
clear when the bankruptcy court might take up the issue again. A
court official said Monday the matter had not yet been added to the
agenda of the next hearing, which is scheduled for Thursday.
   Observer Managing Editor Mark Ethridge III said he believed the
story based on the transcripts was fair, accurate and would not
interfere with justice.
   ``It's not as though it alters the truth,'' Ethridge said.
   He said reporters frequently buy transcripts of trials before
they are entered into the court record.
   Bakker is preparing to defend himself against a $52 million
lawsuit filed by PTL that charges him with grossly mismanaging the
ministry, the business he founded but later left after
acknowledging a sexual encounter with a church secretary.
   The PTL lawsuit alleges that Bakker and former aide David
Taggart took millions of dollars from the ministry for their
personal use even though they knew PTL faced financial trouble.
   On Friday, bankruptcy Trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton announced a
tentative agreement to sell PTL's Heritage USA Christian theme
park, satellite television network and 1,700 undeveloped acres for
$113 million to a Canadian company, Samoth Capital Corp.

<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 3 grafs at bottom to give meeting on Georgia delegation,
House vote on elections measure; CORRECTS spelling of ``sphinx'' in

<TEXT>
   George Bush, teeing off on his Democratic
opponent during a rare pre-convention platform appearance, accused
Michael Dukakis on Monday of being ``the stealth candidate''
pushing policies that ``can be neither seen nor heard.''
   Dukakis _ whose lead in the national polls has triggered an
avalanche of Bush attacks in the past week _ told reporters in
Boston he was not going to respond ``every day to what some
speechwriter has put in front of Mr. Bush.''
   ``George Bush has some of the highest negatives ever recorded in
the history of American politics and I think one of the reasons for
it is people have seen his campaign as an essentially negative
campaign,'' Dukakis said.
   While the presidential contenders engaged in long-distance
sniping, the Republicans' convention city turned much of its
attention to weather reports concerning tropical storm Beryl, which
was near the Louisiana coast and forcing evacuations from oil rigs
on land and in the Gulf of Mexico. The storm was described as
moving slowly and erratically away from land.
   Bush flew into and out of New Orleans in a matter of hours,
taking time to tell the Republican Platform Committee he wanted to
campaign on a crystal-clear statement of party principles.
   Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater said again Monday that Bush is
intentionally playing coy on his selection of a running mate in
order to build interest in a convention that promises no other
surprises. ``He will have a maximum television audience. I'm for
doing anything that will help build up a TV audience,'' Atwater
said.
   Bush has said he will withhold his choice until the last day of
the convention, and his only comment Monday was, ``Still working on
it.''
   He was equally uninformative at a family dinner Sunday night in
Kennebunkport, Maine, where he had spent the weekend.
   ``We went around the table last night at dinner. Some popped off
and argued. I sat silent, like a sphinx,'' Bush said. According to
his oldest son, George W. Bush: ``We bombarded him at dinner.
Nothing. No expression on his face.''
   President Reagan, warming to his role as Bush campaigner,
boasted of the accomplishments of the past seven years of
Republican control of the White House, though he stayed away from
the specifics of the Bush-Dukakis match-up in a speech to the
nation's governors in Cincinnati.
   ``Our states, like our citizens, have known the blessings of the
longest peacetime economic expansion on record,'' Reagan said. ``In
the last seven and one-half years, we have broken the federal
government of its compulsion to control every breath the states
take.''
   Bush and Reagan are not scheduled to appear together at next
week's convention, but the vice president said a joint airport
appearance was possible on the second day of the meeting.
   ``I think the grand planners are working on it,'' Bush said.
Such a joint appearance ``would be good for me. ... There are no
questions on where the president stands on his support for me _
strong.''
   Bush stepped to center stage in the city that will host his
nomination, trailing Dukakis in the polls the week before the GOP
convention opens. He made an unusual appearance for a nominee-to-be
_ speaking in person to the platform committee about what he wants
in the document to be adopted here next week.
   He dismissed the Democrats' platform, adopted last month in
Atlanta, as a ``document of deceit.'' And he told the platform
committee, ``We need to make this campaign a plan for the future, a
statement of solutions, not an exercise in evasion. We should make
our principles and our policies crystal clear to the American
people.''
   He missed no opportunity to attack Dukakis.
   ``He's the stealth candidate,'' the vice president said. ``For
while he can't decide about the stealth bomber, he favors instead
stealth policies _ they can be neither seen nor heard. ... His
campaign jets from place to place, but no issues show up on the
radar screen.
   ``Their nominee spoke for 50 minutes in Atlanta and failed to
mention the most important issue of our time: how to make the world
a safer place,'' he added.
   The stealth bomber is a supersecret craft designed to evade
detection. Dukakis has said he supports development of the bomber
but would not commit to deploying the craft until he saw how well
it would operate.
   Touring the Superdome where he will receive the party's
nomination next week, Bush denied that he was engaging in negative
campaigning.
   ``No, no ... very positive,'' Bush told reporters.
   But he did say, ``We've got to get these differences in focus,''
as he toured a large room where teen-agers were making signs for
the convention.
   Then, refering to the Democratic convention _ where he was a
frequent target _ Bush said: ``That was negative campaigning.''
   Bush had a brown-bag lunch _ turkey sandwich and potato chips _
with the construction workers who are turning the giant football
arena into a political hall.
   ``This is my life, man, and I tell you it's looking great,''
Bush said as he looked around the mostly empty building.
   Members of the party's Committee on Contests spent Monday trying
to resolve challenges to as many as 39 of the 48 delegates from
Georgia. Bush won the primary there, but supporters of television
evangelist Pat Robertson made a run at taking over the party
machinery.
   Regardless who is seated, the delegates must vote for Bush.
   In Washington, the House approved legislation to prohibit
political contributions for state and local campaigns from being
used for a federal race _ a step critics say amounts to protection
for members of Congress.
   The measure goes to the Senate on a voice vote..

   The city will not enforce a 1 a.m. curfew at
most parks this summer to prevent violence similar to a weekend
riot that left 38 people injured, officials said Monday.
   ``The weather is very hot. The beaches are closed. People are
really angry about (the curfew),'' Mayor Edward I. Koch said of the
confrontation early Sunday in Tompkins Square Park on Manhattan's
Lower East Side.
   Koch also blamed ``provocateurs,'' saying they incited the
violence by throwing bottles and fireworks at police.
   ``There are people looking for confrontation. ... And if they
take on a cop, it's at their peril,'' he said.
   Four hundred fifty police officers tangled with 250
demonstrators who gathered in the street outside Tompkins Square
Park to protest its closing. Witnesses charged that protesters and
bystanders were beaten without cause.
   Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward said police tried to close the
park at the request of residents who complained of loud music and
drug dealing.
   Neither Koch nor Ward would say if officers used undue force.
Ward said news footage of officers beating people had to be viewed
in context.
   ``I don't know of any extreme use of force,'' Ward said. But the
Civilain Complaint Review Board said it had received 23 complaints
about police conduct at the riot.
   One alleged victim had a broken finger, three had cuts that
needed stitches, 14 had bruises they said were caused by
nightsticks and five said they were shoved or pushed, said Sandra
Marsh, the board's executive director. ``If there was extreme use
of force, I urge those people to come forward, and their complaints
will be investigated,'' Ward said. Even if officers were attacked,
he said, ``provocation is not a defense to the illegal use of
force.''
   Koch aides distributed photocopies of flyers at a news
conference said to have been handed out by demonstrators. One
warned landlords around Tompkins Square that if the curfew were
enforced ``our organization will destroy your homes''; another was
bordered with drawings of guns and explosives. Koch called them the
work of ``provocateurs,'' and Ward said ``professional
demonstrators'' were involved.
   Curfews at two parks, one in Greenwich Village and one on
Manhattan's East Side, will still be enforced to combat drug
dealing, Koch said.

   ``Cocktail'' poured out another first-place
weekend at the nation's box office with $8.2 million, and Walt
Disney Co. made it a double with ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' in
second place.
   ``Roger Rabbit'' and ``Coming to America,'' both topped the $100
million mark, but the weekend also was hurt with soft openings for
late-summer entrants ``The Blob'' and ``The Rescue.''
   ``Roger Rabbit,'' which earned $5.8 million for the weekend,
became the third Disney film this year to reach the $100 million
level in ticket sales, including ``Three Men And A Baby'' and
``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' which were both released in late 1987.
   In third place was ``Die Hard,'' with the Bruce Willis thriller
earning $5.7 million, followed by ``Coming To America'' with $5
million.
   In fifth place was the John Cleese comedy ``A Fish Called
Wanda,'' which widened its fourth-week distribution to 616 screens
and earned $4.8 million for a $7,794 per screen average.
   ``Midnight Run,'' with Robert DeNiro and Charles Grodin, earned
$3.7 million for sixth place, while longtime summer hit ``Big'' was
in seventh with $2.7 million.
   ``The Blob,'' a remake of the 1958 drive-in thriller featuring
an amorphous mass that grows as it feeds on human victims, did an
anemic $2.6 million for its opening weekend at eighth place.
   ``The Dead Pool,'' the latest ``Dirty Harry'' movie from
actor-director Clint Eastwood, earned $2.2 million for ninth place.
   At the No. 10 spot was ``The Rescue,'' a teen-adventure about a
group of young Americans who attempt to save their military fathers
from imprisonment in North Korea.
   Here are the top films for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross, number of weeks in

<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A remote-controlled bomb exploded on a
road Monday amid the motorcade of Secretary of State George P.
Shultz, shattering the window of his wife's car but causing no
injuries.
   Shultz, part of whose visit to Bolivia was to express U.S.
support for this South American nation's anti-drug efforts, said he
``will not be intimidated ... the war against drugs will be won.''
   The Bolivian government blamed cocaine traffickers for the
assassination attempt on the outskirts of La Paz, and for an
earlier bombing Monday at the U.S. commissary in the capital city.
No injuries were reported but the commissary door was damaged in
that explosion, which happened at 6:30 a.m..
   Speaking at a news conference Monday afternoon, Shultz praised
the Bolivian government's fight against narcotics.
   ``When the history of the war against narcotics is written,
Bolivia will rank high. Millions who are young, still more millions
not yet born will owe you a priceless debt of gratitude,'' Shultz
said.
   He told reporters, ``We will not be intimidated by the tactic of
using violence to try to scare government officials. The war
against drugs will be won and we will not be deterred.''
   Shultz described the bombing as ``anti-democratic and against
human decency. ... The United States supports and will continue to
support Bolivia's strenuous efforts to combat cocaine trafficking.''
   In Washington, State Department officials said a team of State
Department security agents will fly to Bolivia Tuesday to help
investigate the bombings.
   Police said the bomb, which they believe was several sticks of
dynamite, was set off by someone on a grassy hill overlooking the
road seconds after Shultz's car had passed.
   At the time of the blast, about 9:20 a.m., dozens of people were
on the hill watching the 11-car motorcade travel from the airport
to the city.
   Three cars were damaged, including one in which Shultz's wife,
Helena, was traveling.
   The explosion, witnessed by this reporter from a vantage point
several cars behind the official motorcade, blew a hole in the road
and scattered chunks of pavement, rocks and dirt over a wide area.
   Afterward, dozens of police officers hurriedly sealed off the
road and climbed a nearby hill to search for the bombers. They
found a wire they said had been used to detonate the bomb.
   In a statement released at the White House, presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``Terrorist tactics, such as used
against Secretary Shultz and his motorcade in Bolivia today, are
always repugnant.''
   ``Thankfully, the secretary's party was not injured, but the
fact remains that an attack on U.S. officials cannot be tolerated.
We ask the government of Bolivia to bring those responsible to
justice,'' he said.
   Shultz was riding in the first few cars of the motorcade, apart
from his wife. Mrs. Shultz was in the first car that was damaged,
medical personnel were in the second, and Shultz spokesman Charles
Redman was in the third, said State Department spokeswoman Phyllis
Oakley in Washington.
   The bomb, which exploded between the sixth and seventh cars,
smashed windows and blew tires on the three damaged cars.
   Shultz had been scheduled to go the Hotel La Paz but instead was
rushed directly to the U.S. Embassy, which was cordoned off by
police and had sharpshooters dispatched to the roof.
   The rest of Shultz's schedule was unchanged, Ms. Oakley said.
   No claim of responsibility was made, but Foreign Minister
Guillermo Bedregal said both bombings were the work of cocaine
dealers. Bedregal was riding in Shultz's car with U.S. Embassy
charge d'affaires David Greenley.
   Shultz told a group of government officials and business leaders
in La Paz that ``the United States, as the biggest consumer of
drugs in the world, has a special responsibility in this battle.''
   He listed U.S. anti-drug efforts and then noted passage of a law
here that declares 90 percent of coca plants illegal and imposes
stiff penalties on cocaine producers and traffickers.
   ``The pirates and warlords of the drug business have fought you
at every step, with money, intimidation and violence,'' Shultz told
the gathering. ``But there can be no question that Bolivia has made
the right choice. We salute you for that choice.''
   Active U.S. cooperation with government efforts to fight the
drug trade has angered the 350,000 farmers _ from among Bolivia's
6.7 million population _ who depend on coca leaf farming and
cocaine production for a living. They say the U.S. and Bolivian
governments are not doing enough to assist in the transition to
other crops.
   The issue of U.S. economic aid topped the agenda in Shultz's
meetings here, Planning Minister Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada said.
   Shultz said the U.S. government will revise its financial
commitments here and speed up disbursements of funds already
approved by Congress, he reported.
   On Monday evening, the secretary flew to Santa Cruz, 420 miles
east of La Paz, to meet former military strongman Hugo Banzer
Suarez before continuing on to Costa Rica. Banzer now reads the
nationalist Democratic Action Party.
   The 67-year-old Shultz has been secretary of state since 1982.
He has traveled widely during that time but has never been attacked
before.
   Shultz, on a 10-day, nine-country Latin American tour aimed at
gaining support for Reagan administration policies, flew to Bolivia
from Brazil. His tour began Aug. 1 in Guatemala City and is
scheduled to end Wednesday in Ecuador.

   Fireworks exploded in the night sky over
Baghdad early Tuesday and jubilant Iraqis fired thousands of
bullets into the air to celebrate ``the great victory'' over Iran.
   The celebration came after U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar announced in New York on Monday that Iran and Iraq had
agreed to a cease-fire in their eight-year-old war.
   Perez de Cuellar said the cease-fire would start Aug. 20 and
peace negotiations would take place five days later.
   Shortly after midnight, government television called on Iraqis
``to celebrate the great victory achieved by Iraq'' on ``the
greatest day of all.''
   It announced a tree-day period of celebration.
   The war has killed or wounded about 1 million people and cost
both countries billions of dollars.
   Iraqis danced on pickup trucks and waved palm leaves from the
windows of cars driving through Baghdad as tracer bullets and
flares flashed overhead.
   ``The war is over. Victory for Iraq,'' said a man at the
entrance to the Al-Rashid hotel as he looked up at the fireworks.
   ``The war is over, praise be to God,'' said a woman beside him.
   ``Here, take this'' a security man said, offering a reporter an
automatic rifle.
   The guard then fired the rifle into the sky, laughing with other
security men across the street who unleashed scores of rounds from
a machine gun.
   Not all of the bullets went skyward. A car in the Al-Rashid
parking lot had a bullet hole in the hood.
   Children scampered through the streets collecting cartridges.

   The owners of a boarding house where
Eugene O'Neill wrote his first plays agreed Monday to give
preservationists a chance to save the building by moving it to
another location.
   The owners wanted to raze the house, built around 1860, to make
way for a summer home, but the state won a temporary injunction
blocking the demolition.
   The agreement, which still must be formally presented to the
court, ``gives everybody at least something of what they want,''
said state Assistant Attorney General Lawrence Russ, representing
the state Historical Commission.
   The owners gave the state until January to decide whether the
1{-story building can be moved, and until March 1, 1989 to remove
the building from its site on a sandy stretch of the Thames River
in southeastern Connecticut.
   Edward Moukawsher, attorney for the four owners, said the house
is run-down and that it would have been too much of a burden to
restore it. Moukawsher had argued that the house, built in
Carpenter Gothic style, was only of minor historical significance
and that its importance had been exaggerated.
   The O'Neill family's summer home, Monte Cristo Cottage, is
located only a block away from the boarding house and is listed as
a National Historic Landmark.
   The boarding house could not receive that designation because of
its historical similarity to the cottage, Russ said.
   O'Neill was convalescing from tuberculosis when he was taken on
as a winter guest at the boarding house in 1913-14, while the rest
of his family traveled on a theater tour.
   During that time, he produced four one-act plays that were
incorporated into his first published work, ``Thirst and Other One
Act Plays,'' and his first full-length play, ``Bread and Butter,''
said historic preservationists.
   While moving the house would strip it of some of its historical
significance, it still would be the building where O'Neill began
his career as a dramatist, Russ said.
   O'Neill, who died in 1953, won four Pulitzer Prizes for his
plays and the Nobel Prize in literature.
   The agreement was reached on the same day a Superior Court
hearing was set on whether the injunction should remain in effect
pending a trial. Russ conceded that the state would not have been
able to prevent the home's ultimate destruction if a trial had been
held.

<TEXT>
   This tiny town's number came up Monday
_ 8-8-88 _ and visitors crowded in from around the country, calls
came in from around the world and the post office was besieged with
thousands and thousands of letters.
   ``You've got to think of your eight lingo on a day like today,''
said Mike Carroll of nearby Bowling Green, whose favorite number is
eight. ``I bought an eight-pack of beer, and I'm having a great
time, g-r-e-i-g-h-t.''
   Visitors to the southwestern Kentucky town 8.8 miles southeast
of Glasgow could buy sandwiches or an RC Cola-moon pie combination
for 88 cents at the 88 Market under a banner that read ``Happy
Birthday Eighty Eight, Ky.''
   ``It's crazy,'' said the market's owner, Rosemary McPherson.
``It's just unbelievable. The world's gone crazy.''
   Capping the celebration was the 8:08 p.m. wedding of Tom Accardo
and Deborah Muhlbeier of Casper, Wyo., on the eighth step of the
Refuge Church of Christ.
   About 500 well-wishers, most of them residents or tourists,
cheered when the couple said ``I do'' and then climbed into a hot
air balloon tethered across the street from the church and became
airborne for the toss of the bouquet of eight white roses.
   ``8-8 of 88 will be absolutely branded in my mind,'' said
Accardo, 29. ``The people here have been fantastic.''
   ``Our marriage is magical. It's just the icing on the cake and
I'm telling you it's thick icing,'' said Mrs. Accardo, 34. ``The
biggest part of it is the people of Eighty Eight. The town has been
incredible. You walk into town and you're part of the family.''
   Residents gave the couple a wedding cake with an ``88'' perched
on top and a reception for about 600.
   Ms. McPherson said she went to bed in the wee hours after
Sunday's preliminary celebration and got about two hours' sleep
before the telephone started ringing. Calls came in from more than
150 radio stations across the country, as well as stations in
London and Australia, wanting interviews.
   ``I guess every state has contacted us at this time,'' she said.
   She said she was happy and excited, ``but I'm exhausted. I
enjoyed my little store the way it was.''
   She made change for R.A. Edwards of Glasgow, who made out a
check to the 88 Market for $8.88 for a T-shirt, which was actually
$6.29.
   Ms. McPherson's business in Eighty Eight caps and T-shirts
boomed Monday, as did the traffic at a mobile temporary post office
set up across the highway.
   Fred Van Fleet, the U.S. Postal Service's area manager, said the
post office had handled 25,000 pieces of mail Monday for people
wanting the EIGHTY-EIGHT 8-8-88 cancellation.
   ``We've had people come in here from all over the country,'' he
said. ``It's really amazing the number of people that have been
here.''
   Donnie Sue Bacon, Eighty Eight postmistress, said on an average
day the town handles 100 pieces of mail.
   ``I've been here 31 years, and I've never seen anything like
this,'' she said. ``It's really something.''
   ABC's ``Good Morning, America'' broadcast a segment of Monday's
show from this small farming community of 150 residents. They
interviewed eight people.
   Carroll questioned the reasoning for setting the parade, with
88-year-old Eighty Eight resident Elsie Billingsley leading in a
red sports car, on Sunday.
   ``How could they possibly do that?''
   Legend has it that Eighty Eight was named by Dabnie Nunnally, a
postmaster in the 1860s, who took his inspiration from the 88 cents
he found in his pocket.
   Visitors Ray and Loraine Heist of Crescent Springs, who marked
their 49th wedding anniversary Monday, said they heard about the
town's celebration and decided to visit for the day.
   ``I think it's great. People are getting a big kick out of
this,'' Mrs. Heist said.
   Susan Delight Voignier of Lexington, who wore a T-shirt with the
front of her birth certificate printed on the front and the reverse
side printed on the back, was born at 8 a.m. on Aug. 8, 1947, in
New Albany, Ind.
   ``I've been waiting a lot of years for this year. I'm supposed
to be doing other things today, but ... I came down here because
it's magical,'' she said.
   Ms. Voignier sent one piece of mail, a postcard to her mother in
Hamburg, Ind., that said: ``Thank you for the gift of life.''

   Iran is returning equipment it rented to
search for the still-missing flight recorder from the Iran Air
jetliner shot down by the U.S. Navy, the official Islamic Republic
News Agency said Monday.
   IRNA quoted an unidentified airport official in Iran's southern
port city of Bandar Abbas as saying electronic beeps given off by
the flight recorder had almost stopped.
   Iran said an oil-exploration ship equipped with exploratory
devices will continue the search after engine repair work.
   The report quoted another unidentified source as saying the
intensive search, using equipment rented from Britain, was not
really needed as the Navy admitted it shot down the plane.
   The Iran Air Airbus was shot down July 3 by the missile cruiser
USS Vincennes while on a flight over the southern Persian Gulf from
Bandar Abbas to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. All 290 people
on board were killed.
   U.S. Navy officials said the Vincennes mistook the passenger
plane for an F-14 jet fighter planning to attack.

Iran has agreed to Iraq's compromise proposal that direct peace
talks quickly follow a cease-fire.
   Perez de Cuellar's announcement that he would today set a

the establishment of a Palestinian government-in-exile and welcome
a PLO embassy in Amman.
   The Jordanian monarch made the comments to reporters Sunday as
draft documents calling for an independent Palestinian state
circulated in Israel's occupied lands, where the uprising entered
its ninth month today.
   By severing administrative ties with the West Bank, Hussein has
challenged the PLO to make good on its claims to leadership in the
territory that Israel seized from his family's control 21 years ago.

   The owners of 1988 passenger vans and large
sedans are likely to have fewer damage claims and lower repair
bills, while those who own sports cars and some compact cars may
not be as lucky, according to an insurance industry report.
   The study by the Highway Loss Data Institute, an insurance
research group, examined both the frequency of insurance collision
claims and the average amount of the claim for 60 new cars that had
repairs paid through insurance policies during the first nine
months of the 1988 model year.
   ``Even among cars of the same size class and body style there
were large variations in results,'' the insurance group said. But
it said that in general, larger cars had a better collision loss
record than smaller vehicles.

   Children as young as 13, eagerly seeking a martyr's death,
perished as sacrificial mine sweepers. Children, parents and
grandparents were blown to bits or crippled by bombs, shells and
missiles in the cities of both sides. Soldiers and civilians were
maimed by poison warfare.
   In all, more than 1 million people were killed or wounded. The
war cost hundreds of billions of dollars and caused measureless

   The discovery of new planets and of complex

intelligent life could have developed elsewhere in the universe,
Michael J. Klein, manager of NASA's radio search for life, said

   Klein said discoveries announced last week that planet-like
objects have been found orbiting distant stars, and that organic
chemicals thought to be the precursors to life exist in comets
support fundamental theories about life evolving from cosmic
chemistry.
   ``That is the circumstantial evidence that life exists

   The Detroit News and Detroit Free Press will
be allowed to merge their business and production operations
because the smaller Free Press was in danger of financial failure
stemming from years of steady and apparently irreversible losses,
Attorney General Edwin Meese III said Monday.
   In approving the application for a joint operating agreement,
Meese rejected the recommendation of a Justice Department
administrative law judge who said the two newspapers' pricing
policies were unrealistic.
   Meese, however, said there was little prospect for the Free
Press to return to profitability in Detroit's highly competitive
market.
   ``For me, the continuing and persistent operating losses
suffered by the Free Press over the course of nearly a decade, with
no prospect of unilaterally reversing that economic condition in
the foreseeable future, describes a newspaper `in danger of
financial failure','' Meese said in his opinion.
   Meese told reporters that the Free Press' losses were not

   Ten years after Love Canal was
declared a national disaster area because buried chemicals were
oozing to the surface, the largely abandoned neighborhood remains
at the center of environmental debate.
   The former chemical dump that forced hundreds of families from
their homes has been fenced off and surrounded with clay and
plastic liners to prevent chemicals from leaking into groundwater.
   Corroding drums of chemicals have been separated and complex
runoff monitoring and collection systems have been built.
   But even though the contamination has been largely contained and
state officials have begun to talk about restoring the neighborhood
to residential use, critics think Love Canal and hundreds of
similar sites throughout the nation will remain potential disasters
until a safe disposal method is found.

   Novelist Nikos Kazantzakis, who created
joy of life with ``Zorba the Greek'' and a religious storm with
``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' remains popular in his native
land 30 years after his death.
   His novels sell thousands of copies every year, mainly in Greek
but also in English, French, German and Japanese. He is believed to
be the most-read writer in modern Greek.
   ``We have a huge turnover in the half-dozen major Kazantzakis
novels. ... In Greek he's mostly bought by young people, and then
the tourists pick up the foreign language copies,'' said Byron
Dokimakis. He owns a leading bookstore in Heraklion, capital of
Crete, the island where Kazantzakis was born.
   Dokimakis said the two most popular novels are ``Zorba,'' an
exuberant portrayal set on Crete of a man with a huge zest for
life, and ``Last Temptation,'' which presents Jesus as a weak,
unstable man who doubts his divinity and dreams of making love to
Mary Magdalene, the reformed sinner.

   As the TV generation comes of age, more
companies are turning to video magazines, brochures, catalogues and
annual reports to get their message across with sound, sight and
action.
   ``It's very much a growing trend... We're in the television
generation,'' said International Television Association spokesman
Paul Kleyman.
   The group's U.S. members, who operate corporate video efforts,
have grown from 1,600 to 9,000 since 1978. Corporate video outlays
reached $5.5 billion in 1987, up from $1.1 billion in 1980,
according to a recent study, Kleyman said.
   Using telegenic visuals, sharp graphics and background music,
video publications are becoming the way to reach teens and adults
who prefer the tube. Some of the slickly produced videos are
televised companions of printed media. Others stand alone or
supplement face-to-face meetings.
   ``Little by little younger employees are asking for more things
on video,'' said Ron Hale of Southern California Gas Co., which
began ``Newsline,'' a TV show for staffers, in 1984. ``The
generation that has grown up on television expects to get their
information quickly and on the tube.''
   Much like a company newspaper, the magazine-format show features
segments on gaining customers, how to safely use torches when
cutting gas lines, and how gas delivery to some customers was
curtailed during a winter shortage.
   Programs are produced four times yearly, for $20,000 to $25,000
each. The utility's 9,500 employees view them at 200 sites
throughout the company. Some take videocassettes home to watch,
Hale said.
   Allstate Insurance produces its own videos to welcome new
workers, show corporate policyholders how to reduce accidents, and
help claims adjusters standardize estimates. This year some agents
are visiting families with a new life insurance video they can play
on home recorders.
   ``He'll pop the video in the VCR and it will show how the
product can really benefit them,'' said Allstate assistant vice
president Deborah Kamp. ``It's an emotional product that we're
selling. The use of emotions can help people understand the
importance of the product to their family's livelihood.''
   Video publishing also is moving into stockholder meetings.
Instead of speeches from top executives, some corporations show a
company-produced video before taking questions from the floor, said
George Hobgood, who prepares corporate annual reports.
   ``Three years ago I wasn't doing any video work,'' said Hobgood,
who expects to produce five to six annual report videos this year.
``People will watch a 10 or 12 minute video. You may or may not be
able to get them to read the same thing on paper.''
   Since companies must file printed reports with government
agencies, Hobgood doesn't see television replacing print. Cost and
portabability are other print advantages.
   ``I don't see them replacing print,'' said Jody Uttal-Gold, who
has produced corporate videos for five years. Unlike print, she
said, people ``can't take the video home.''
   ``There's still a lot of resistance,'' from some corporations,
she said. ``They don't want to spend that kind of money and they
don't think people are going to view it.''
   Still, video uses are growing as a TV generation finds new
applications for its favorite medium. Redlands, Calif., produced a
video ``windshield tour'' of itself when officials presented a $7
million municipal bond issue to New York firms setting the city's
credit rating last Spring.
   ``Normally it is done verbally and maybe with some flip charts
or slides showing the city or project that's going to be
financed,'' said John Fitzgerald of the firm organizing the bond
issue.
   Video publishing has natural advantages for some topics and
audiences, said Victor Livingston, executive producer of ``Business
Television Report,'' a quarterly videocassette magazine for
television industry executives.
   ``We cover the business of television on television,'' said
Livingston in a telephone interview from New York. The video
magazine is sent on cassettes to targeted industry leaders and
distributed by satellite to TV stations.
   Several printed trade magazines cover the television business.
But Livingston, a former Cablevision Magazine editor, started the
video magazine last Autumn because he ``wondered why the television
industry did not use the power and impact of its own medium to
report on itself.''
   The television magazine shows examples of programs and screens
new technologies, along with on-camera interviews. Also included
are commercials geared for TV executives; such as the Nickelodeon
cable channel and video equipment makers.
   Other video publishing includes colleges sending tapes to high
schools to recruit students and companies issuing video catalogues
of wares. Hardware stores and supermarkets screen videos in their
aisles to demonstrate how products are used.
   Video publishing is growing ``simply because organizations
understand they have to communicate in ways that people are
comfortable being communicated with,'' said Marcy Rothenberg, a
University of Southern California journalism professor. ``It's a
format people are used to seeing. It's visual.''
   Video costs are steep compared to print. Southern California
Gas' Hale said one production of ``Newsline'' costs more than a
year of the utility's employee magazine. Production costs are going
down, but video producers have found they can't sacrifice quality
to save money.
   ``I don't think you can go cheap and have a good result,'' said
Ms. Rothenberg. ``People don't want to see home movies. They want
to see something like what they see on television.''

   If not for a bunch of guys sitting around a
bar in Denver a few years ago, there would be no ``Roseanne'' on
ABC this coming season.
   Well, maybe it isn't world peace, but it has changed the life of
comedian Roseanne Barr who will star as the wisecracking ``domestic
goddess'' in the half-hour comedy that might just be ABC's best bet
for a new season hit.
   ``I was a cocktail waitress. My customers encouraged me to go
down to this comedy club. I didn't know it was there. So I went
down there and watched everybody,'' she said.
   A year later she had written five minutes' worth of material
that led her to Los Angeles where was called from the secondary
stage at The Comedy Store to main room and discovered by comedy
producer George Schlatter.
   The routine at the root of this frenzy of success was described
by Barr for a group of television critics: ``I go, `Hi, I'm a
housewife, domestic goddess, then I tell jokes about my kids and
then I tell jokes about my husband and then I get off.''
   Her remarkable poise as a woman busting into a man's
standup-comic world came from the ``back-and-forthing'' with the
boys in the bar.
   ``If those guys hadn't laughed, I probably wouldn't be doin'
this now.''
   She is pressed on just what one-liners so impressed cocktail
purchasers that they would encourage her to go pro.
   ``Most of it is so filthy, you couldn't print it,'' she says.
   Well, OK.
   ``This guy goes, `Do you know any married women that don't want
to get a divorce but want to have an affair with a married guy
who'll treat 'em real good and spend a lot of money on 'em and make
love a lot and all this stuff?' And I go _ `Yeah. Your wife.'''
   Barr's hapless and seemingly worthless husband is the butt of
many of her jokes, but in real life Bill Pentland was an early
supporter of her career, helping develop her material. He is a
writer and likely sometime performer on the sitcom, scheduled to
debut probably in November. John Goodman (``Raising Arizona'')
plays her TV husband.
   ``My real husband is like a lot more bizarre than my character
husband,'' Barr said. ``He's very funny. He's like the funniest
person I ever knew my whole life, and he's very bizarre and he
doesn't have any respect for anything, and he's very much an
anarchist.''
   They met when she was living in a commune in the Rocky Mountains
and ``he had the only toilet in the county'' since he worked as the
night manager at a motel. ``We were really hippy people.''
   ``Me and him went to this club the first time I ever went down
there. We sat there together and we were both like really appalled
at what they were saying on stage and like what's happened to
comedy?' All the ``pig jokes about women'' convinced the two of
them that Barr should take on the comedy establishment and offer
``the other side.''
   Barr's humor is more than yocks. It has a political,
working-class edge that will likely find its way into the sitcom.
   She doesn't like the sitcom moms offered to the TV public so
far. ``You're just a working stiff and this is your job. I wish
people would stop thinking it was destiny and start thinking it's a
job.
   ``You try to keep everything light and funny as you can because
there's no other way to survive being a working-class person
without any money.''
   Barr said she loves Carol Burnett because ``she's so real and
she seems like your neighbor and somebody you'd like to know.'' But
she says she was baffled by the popularity of the old ``I Love
Lucy'' show.
   ``I like Lucy but I hated that show, because she has to beg her
husband for five bucks and he spanks her... I never ever understood
that even as a little girl.''
   Ralph and Alice Kramden on ``The Honeymooners'' are her
favorites, ``'cause you know they love each other and they're just
picking at each other, which is kind of the thing I want on our
show, rather than `Married ... with Children' and that mean thing.
I just want to like this nice lady that's funny and has this edge,
which is how I see myself.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   FROM THE ``IT'S A JOKE'' FILE _ Bryant Gumbel is still steamed
about the potshots that David Letterman has taken at him since the
megaphone incident a couple of years ago. At a recent news
conference, Gumbel even impuned Letterman's masculinity for not
doing the ``guys'' thing and calling up and apologizing. ``I don't
expect David to do a mea culpa on the air. But I would have thought
he'd be enough of a man to pick up the phone and say, `It's gotten
out of hand, I'm sorry.' That hasn't happened. I'm not asking for
it to happen. I'm really not. I guess what I'm saying is the fact
that it hasn't happened tells me a lot about the guy.'' In an
interview last year, Letterman suggested forming a support group to
meet in a church basement to help Gumbel get over his distress. The
feud stems from the ``Today'' show's prime-time special in 1986
when Letterman shouted out his window with a megaphone as ``Today''
was taping. Gumbel thought it was unprofessional. Letterman
maintains he was invited by the show's producer to pull such a
prank, but someone apparently didn't warn Gumbel.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Nineteen years ago a contingent of Hare Krishnas
founded a community in the Appalachians, and their Palace of Gold
became a big tourist attraction. In recent years, their enclave
also drew its share of trouble.

<DATELINE>NEW VRINDABAN, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They flocked to West Virginia's hill
country to build their Hare Krishna community, seeking peace and a
higher consciousness. Now there's been talk of demons whirling in
the upper air to menace their faith.
   More tangible threats have bedeviled the community below: a
murder a year ago, a mysterious death last spring, arson, lawsuits,
harassment by dissidents, excommunication by the larger Hare
Krishna movement, ugly accusations of child molestation and abuse,
even an FBI ``raid.''
   Through it all, the remnant of adherents at New Vrindaban, down
to 150 to 300 from perhaps twice that strength several years ago,
is carrying on.
   Whatever was wrong in their community in the past, the faithful
say, has been straightened out, and they place their hopes for the
future in their children _ children whose upbringing is admittedly
``different.''
   A 7-year-old worries about the afterlife. ``He asked me, `If you
think of Godhead when you die, do you get to Godhead?''' his
spiritual teacher says.
   The boy had special reasons to wonder. His father's body,
charred, a bullet wound in its head, the remains gnawed by his own
pit bulls, was found near Krishna property this spring.
   Donald Bordenkircher, the Marshall County sheriff, won't say
that Todd Schenker was murdered. He says:
   ``What we have is a male adult who apparently shot himself in
the head, set himself on fire and then threw the gun away. Like
everything at New Vrindaban, this case is very suspicious and
bizarre.''
   In 1987, the FBI seized truckloads of computers, financial
records and sports souvenirs the Krishnas were selling, but never
filed charges and returned most of the goods.
   New Vrindaban, named after a holy town in India, was founded 19
years ago. Here the devotees built their ``Palace of Gold,'' a
dazzling little shrine that once drew some 250,000 tourists a year.
There are far fewer now.
   The remaining believers live below and beyond the hilltop
shrine, scattered in the valleys and ridges in mostly make-do
houses.
   The community was rocked by formal charges against two ashram
teachers that they sexually abused their wards. A former member
claims in a court deposition that New Vrindaban leaders ignored the
sexual molestation of her son, even told her it would advance the
youngster spiritually.
   Other former members say the community's leader, Kirtanananda
Swami Bhaktipada, forced them into childhood marriages. They tell
of beatings and other abuses.
   It was when these and other troubles thickened that Bhaktipada _
a former Columbia University student and the son of a Baptist
minister _ spoke of the demons trying to bring misfortune on the
Palace of Gold.
   The Krishnas have made changes. New ashram leaders have been
brought in. Some Krishna children now attend public schools. And
community teachers have been trained to spot sexual abuse.
   But child molestation charges still are pending against one
former ashram teacher, Schenker's death is unsolved, one swami
still must stand trial on charges he killed a devotee who turned
against the sect, and a two-year federal investigation of the
community continues.
   Devotees are weary.
   ``I feel like an animal in the zoo,'' complains Gopi, an
18-year-old who moved to New Vrindaban with her parents when she
was 12. She left once, but soon returned.
   ``This is my religion. This is what I believe, my home,'' she
says.
   The Krishnas believe in reincarnation, the level of each
succeeding life determined by spiritual attainments and a higher
consciousness. They are vegetarians and allow no drugs, illicit sex
or gambling.
   Menial tasks are considered acts of devotion when performed in
the name of Krishna _ the Krishna who rewards and punishes for the
deeds of past lives. Krishna controls destiny. Krishna is all.

   ``I was crazy and I was lazy until I offered a daisy to Krishna,
with love and devotion...''
   Hari Kirtan croons off-key as he plunks on the piano,
10-year-old fingers stretching to hit the right keys.
   About 30 children live in the ashram, a long building with
rustic bedrooms surrounding a central hall large enough to
roller-skate in. Each of six teachers cares for a half-dozen
children, boys on the right, girls on the left. Their parents work
in the community or raise money on the outside.
   The children rise early for a 5 a.m., two-hour worship service
at the gold embellished temple next door, men on the right, women
on the left.
   Small boys jump wildly through the incense to the rhythm of
drums and cymbals, ponytails flying, saffron robes riding high
above white athletic socks. Small girls in long skirts and scarves
wind through the chanting, dancing crowd with flowers or small
flaming lamps cradled in their hands.
   They attend school (either Krishna or public), eat vegetarian
meals, sing religious songs and play.
   They look happy. They look healthy.
   Former devotees have told of a darker side to ashram life.
   Kanka Dasi, her Krishna name, contends her 12-year-old boy told
her in 1986 that his ashram teachers sexually molested him for five
years.
   She testified in a court deposition that she told Bhaktipada
about the abuse.
   ``He became angry,'' Kanka testified. ``He said I was just a
stupid woman _ how much sex have I had in my life? And I told him
that it didn't compare, that two consenting adults and a child
being molested by a teacher are two different things and it's very
demonic.''
   Kanka said Bhaktipada threatened to expel anyone who supported
the allegations. Other parents did nothing, she said.
   Kanka told her story in a lengthy deposition given for Christina
Mills, a former devotee who left her children with their father at
New Vrindaban two years ago and now is trying to get them back.
   Mills' lawyers filed depositions from several former adherents
who told stories of intimidation, beatings, filth and sexual abuse.
   According to Marshall County Circuit Court records, Kanka said
she was discouraged from being too close with her child lest it
interfere with his spiritual development.
   She left with her son, while the accused teachers remained in
the ashram until the county prosecutor's office filed charges
against them.
   Teacher's aide Frederick Difrancisco, known as ``Lalita'' and 21
at the time, pleaded guilty to third-degree sexual assault and
served six months in a state correctional center. Headmaster Gary
Gardner fled the country rather than face a criminal charge,
authorities said.

   But in the off-season, Hamilton County reports some of the
highest unemployment rates in the nation.
   ``We have a terrible depression every year,'' Lorenzen says.
   In January, Hamilton's unemployment rate hit 15.8 percent, more
than double the national rate, while just 80 miles to the southeast
Albany had a 4.4 jobless rate.
   ``The spring is the slowest time for us,'' says Neil McGovern,
who operates an inn in Speculator. ``Between the bugs and the mud
we have a lot of trouble convincing anyone to come up here in the
spring, partly because we don't believe it ourselves.''
   Summer eases the job pinch. By the Fourth of July, Hamilton
County has virtually full employment.
   When the tourists are not around, everything stops. The two
modest movie theaters shut down. Restaurants and hotels close. And
highway workers stop maintaining the back roads where no one lives.
   To lure winter visitors to the area, which usually gets about
150 inches of snow, the local people created 750 miles of trails
for snowmobiles.
   ``The snowmobiler is the largest contributor to our wintertime
economy. Usually they come in at least overnight and often stay a
Friday and Saturday night while the skiers and ice fishermen are
day-trippers,'' Lorenzen says.
   A furniture maker employs about 20 people in Indian Lake, a
lumbering operation over in Long Lake keeps about 30 people working
and the county has a work force of about 40 people.
   The lack of economic opportunity forces the children to leave
home when they grow up.
   ``They can make a living here, but if they want a career, to be
a doctor or a lawyer, they have to move away,'' says Loretta
Bancroft, who has had five of her children leave the county when
they grew up.
   About the only way young people can afford to stay in Hamilton
County is to follow their father's footsteps. Sheriff Parker
followed his father into law enforcement, and he can rattle off
several examples of sons who took their father's place at garages,
contracting and other jobs around the county.
   While the forces of nature provide local residents with what
economic base they have, it also works to isolate them. Officials
have been forced to shut down one-third of the runway at the
county's only airport because the tops of pine trees in the dense
forest are intruding into the flight path. State officials have
said it would take an amendment to the state Constitution to cut
the trees to allow full use of the runway.
   There has been talk of town house and condominium developments
going up in Speculator and Inlet. Those proposals can generate
heated arguments between people who resent the zoning restrictions
for holding back the local economy and folks who worry about
preserving the wilderness.
   Neil McGovern, who moved his family to Speculator nine years ago
from Long Island, says he's not worried about development turning
Speculator into the kind of suburban sprawl common to so many other
communities.
   ``I moved here from Long Island so I would not have to hear
somebody else's john flush,'' says McGovern. ``We are so far away
from any saturation point.''
   Some conveniences taken for granted most places are not to be
had in Hamilton County.
   ``We have to go out of town for our haircuts,'' McGovern says.
``There are no bagels, and it took my wife and mother-in-law some
time to get used to the 120-mile round-trip to the mall.
   Lorenzen says ``it's a myth'' that living in Hamilton County is
inexpensive. ``We have to truck everything in here. Food is higher.
Gas is higher. People try to do their shopping outside.''
   ``You do try to fix the little things when you can, rather than
call a serviceman,'' says Bill Abrams, who still drives the Chevy
pickup truck his father bought new 21 years ago.
   There are only 892 more people living in the entire county now
than there were in 1925, and the population is not expected to
reach 6,000 for the next two decades.
   Lorenzen, who moved to the shore of Piseco Lake 19 years ago,
says, ``Actually it's a very fine bit of Americana that is slipping
away. A lot of business is carried on on just a handshake and
trust. We don't have to lock our cars. It's an unusual bit of
Americana.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ For 16 days they held out against the Japanese
invasion force, some 1,200 civilians fighting alongside 449
Marines, 68 sailors and six Army Air Corps men. All were either
killed or captured when Wake Island fell on Dec. 23, 1941. A
momument to the military men was erected shortly after the war, but
it was not until this summer that the civilian defenders got their
monument. Many returned to Wake Island for the dedication, some for
the first time since the war.

<TEXT>
   Palm trees and
evergreens grow where once there was only ironwood brush. The
once-countless rats and gooney birds are gone, the coral runway has
been replaced.
   ``It's strange, everything looks so different that walking
around here, looking at the monuments and the old rusted-out guns,
it's almost like looking at someone else's life, like it never
happened to me,'' says Darwin Dodds of Denver, a retired radio and
television broadcaster.
   Dodds was a 22-year-old civilian construction worker captured
when the Japanese invaded this remote tropical atoll in late 1941.
He was one of the defenders of Wake Island who recently returned
for a dedication of a monument in honor of the civilians who fought
alongside the soldiers, sailors and Marines, all of whom were
either killed or captured.
   A memorial to the Marines was erected shortly after the war. But
the civilians _ including construction workers building military
installations and others who worked for Pan American Airways _ got
little credit. It was 1981 before they were deemed eligible for
veterans' benefits, and for 47 years there was no official monument
to them.
   The dedication ceremony drew 42 civilian defenders, 14 military
men, and about about 100 family members. For many of them, the
reunion June 13-16 was their first visit to the island since the
war.
   Ival Dale Milbourn, 64, a retired construction contractor who
lives in Santa Rosa, Calif., still has occasional nightmares about
his war experiences. By bringing his wife, two sons and his
85-year-old father to the reunion, he hoped to put some of the old
ghosts to rest.
   ``This has been a 47-year-dream,'' Milbourn said as he looked
over the post he manned on the day of the first attack on Dec. 8,
1941. ``I just can't explain how I feel, but by having my family
here I feel like they understand why I'm the way I am, why I did
the things I did.''
   Milbourn was 18 years old and a private in the U.S. Marine Corps
when he landed on Wake in late 1941. He still recalls the details
of that first attack, only hours after the Japanese struck Pearl
Harbor. Wake is west of the International Dateline, so it was the
next day there.
   ``We weren't prepared at all,'' says Milbourn, who manned a
3-inch anti-aircraft gun. ``We hadn't even filled the first
sandbag. We ran to our positions and trained right on those planes,
but we were expecting reinforcements and we thought they might be
our own guys.''
   The next 16 days were a blur of daily bombing raids, thwarted
invasions and close-fought battles.
   The outnumbered U.S. troops shot down 21 Japanese planes and
sank at least two destroyers with outmoded weapons salvaged from
warships from World War I. But with no reinforcements and little
ammunition, they surrendered to the Japanese on Dec. 23, 1941.
   ``We were among the last Marines to get the order to
surrender,'' Milbourn recalls, ``and when we were told to give up
our guns, well, that was the first time we ever told an NCO
(non-commissioned officer) `up your bucket' because we'd been told
the Japanese take no prisoners.''
   The Americans were ordered to strip and march down to the old
airstrip, where a ring of machine guns awaited. There they were
tied up and ordered to crouch in the middle of the circle.
   ``We were scared and praying and crying and everything else,''
Milbourn says. ``Then at the last minute, they took the guns down,
because they learned there were civilians among us.''
   The Americans _ 449 Marines, 68 sailors, six Army Air Corps men
and 1,200 civilians _ were left on the airstrip overnight, still
naked and tightly bound.
   The next day they were each given a small piece of bread and a
drink of gasoline-tainted water. It was Dec. 25, 1941.
   ``That was our Christmas dinner, and we had no idea how much
worse it would get,'' Milbourn recalls.
   Most of the prisoners were eventually transferred by boat to
prison camps in Shanghai and Japan. Several prisoners were beheaded
and all were poorly fed along the way. The Japanese kept 98
civilians on the island as slave labor.
   Roger ``Chick'' Bamford of Texarkana, Ark., lied about his age
to join the Marines when he was 15 years old, so he had not even
turned 20 when he was released from prison camp in September 1945,
after the Japanese surrender.
   ``I got the name `Chick' in boot camp because I was such a
kid,'' says Bamford. ``In prison camp the older guys looked out for
me, tried to get me food, because I was in my growing years.''
   Across the atoll, the survivors, many of whom hadn't seen each
other since they were liberated from through all those years in the prison
camps, well, it just
makes you happy to be alive.''
   Of the Americans, 120 were killed in the fighting and 231 died
in captivity. The 98 civilians kept on Wake were executed on Oct.
7, 1943.
   They left behind a reminder of their plight: a large coral
boulder, painstakingly hand-carved with their initials and the
still-legible message that reads``98 US PW (for prisoners of war)
5-10-43.'' Five months later, they were machine-gunned on the beach
in retaliation for a devastating American air strike the day before.
   The memory of those civilians and how they died has haunted many
of the survivors.
   ``When I heard about this trip I thought I wasn't sure I wanted
to go, I didn't know what kind of memories it would bring,'' said
Oscar Ray, 67, now credit manager of a hospital in Boise, Idaho.
The execution of the civilians ``affected me so profoundly that I
couldn't sleep for weeks after hearing about it. I thought it was a
religious duty that I should come back.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Cloyce Webster is a pack rat. He's also a
handyman, storekeeper, cobbler, mechanic, storyteller, artist,
husband and father. In addition to running a cluttered general
store in rural Michigan, he has spent half a century collecting
derelict automobiles and other castoff items most people would call
junk.

<TEXT>
   You won't find Webster, Mich., on any map.
But you won't come across many in these parts who don't know of
Webster and its ``founder,'' Cloyce Webster.
   ``I guess everyone knows about me,'' Webster says, hands thrust
in the pockets of his worn overalls.
   Webster is proprietor of a ramshackle general store on a dirt
road 7 miles north of Fremont. A sign outside reads:
   WEBSTER MICHIGAN
   OPEN 7.A.M. TO 10 P.M.
   CLOSED SUNDAYS
   He has no post office in his store, but he's so well-known
locally that mail addressed to Webster, Mich., reaches him.
   Since first setting up shop here in 1932, Webster has been
collecting derelict automobiles and gadgets, pop bottles and
hubcaps, batteries and milk jugs, toasters and sewing machines, all
kinds of litter that together comprise something of a scrapbook of
the 20th century. Indeed, a trip to Webster throws the visitor into
a time warp, back to the days of Coca-Cola thermometers and 5-cent
soda pop.
   Cloyce Webster, a youthful-looking 70-year-old pack rat,
storekeeper, cobbler, mechanic, storyteller, artist, husband and
father.
   Surrounded by dairy farms that dot the rolling hills of
west-central Michigan, some might call Webster's 27 acres a
junkyard. But among the rusting hulks of 1930s and '40s automobiles
are some treasures.
   ``Sure, I know some of these things are worth a lot,'' he says.
``And I sell some of 'em.''
   He rummages through a box full of antique bottles. ``Here's one
of them old Dr Pepper bottles. Betcha never seen one of them
before.''
   Webster will sell you anything you want. But if you can't pay,
he's been known to make a deal. Cut him some wood, and he'll fix a
battery free of charge.
   Batteries are his specialty. But, he says, he can fix just about
anything ``if I can get the part.''
   Chances are, he has it already.
   Even more remarkably, he knows where it is.
   ``Inventory? I keep it all up here,'' Webster says, pointing to
his soiled, green cap.
   Indeed, there is a touch of organization amid the apparent chaos.
   ``See that '36 Hudson?'' Webster asks, pointing to the
moss-covered automobile partially imbedded in the ground outside
the back of his shop. ``It's filled with table-model radios. That
'35 Chevy over there? Filled with gaskets. Only gaskets.''
   Webster bought most of the old cars and bicycles, although some
were abandoned after being dropped off for repairs. ``I used to buy
everything that came along,'' he says.
   All are for sale.
   ``I can make any one of 'em run,'' Webster insists.
   Entangled in vines and weeds, are probably 500 bicycles and
cars, Webster estimates, not including all the ones in hundreds of
pieces. About 2{ tons of hubcaps are piled up, reaching the
branches of the trees.
   ``I'd clean it all out, but even if I took 10 tons a day out it
would still take seven or eight years to get rid of it all,''
Webster says.
   Inside the weathered building is a cluttered maze of spare parts
and cases of soda bottles stacked to the ceiling, dark and narrow
aisles leading to several rooms. There's a grocery section and a
shoe repair section, where Webster uses car tires to make rubber
soles _ ``guaranteed not to wear out.''
   ``This is where I do my painting,'' Webster says, indicating a
cramped area by a window. There are enamel paints on a cluttered,
flat surface, but no room to sit down.
   It is here that Webster gets away from it all, painting wildlife
scenes on aluminum printing plates.
   ``Ten dollars apiece. I sell lots of 'em,'' Webster says,
pointing to the hundreds of finished products piled in his ``art
department.''
   His subjects come from postcards, photographs, other paintings
or from memory.
   ``I start about 30 of 'em at a time,'' he says proudly,
displaying his favorite nature scenes.
   ``I started drawing on little scraps of paper when I was in the
Air Force so I'd remember what everything looked like,'' Webster
says, taking out a pile of the aging pencil drawings on a shelf.
   An 11th-grade dropout, Webster spent four years in the Air
Force, from 1942 to '46, closing the shop while he was gone.
   When he returned, he married, and he and his wife, Elaine, have
been running the store ever since, living in a rickety house next
door. Webster's 94-year-old father, a former farmer, lives down the
road.
   The Websters have three grown children, one of whom lives nearby
and sometimes helps out at the store, and eight grandchildren.
   Asked if any of his children might take over the business after
he retires, Webster hesitates, as though it was the first time he's
thought about it.
   ``I don't know,'' he says. ``But I'm not retiring any time
soon.''
   That's good news to his regulars.
   ``I've been a regular for five or six years,'' says customer
Floyd Christner, who was here this time for a battery part.
``Whenever I get a flat tire, Cloyce always fixes them _ he fixes
everything.''
   And though some days are slower than others, Webster insists he
does a hearty business, especially considering he doesn't own a
telephone.
   ``If someone wants something, they'd better see me directly,''
he says.
   On Sundays, shaven and spruced up, Webster closes shop and heads
for the United Methodist Church of Hesperia, where he sings in the
choir.
   ``I think I'm pretty good,'' he says, smiling, exposing his two
teeth _ both on the bottom.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ At age 81 and at work on his memoirs, Hugh
MacLennan keeps a surprisingly low profile for a man the Reader's
Guide to the Canadian novel calls ``a writer of unique stature.''
He's written only seven novels and one book of essays in half a
century, but five of those novels won the country's highest
literary prize, the Governor General's Award, and he may have
helped shape Canada's political system.

<TEXT>
   Hugh MacLennan secured a place in Canadian
letters, and the nation's political lexicon, when he explored the
cultural schism between French and English Canada in his evocative
1945 novel, ``Two Solitudes.''
   The title became a code word for the linguistic divide, and
MacLennan was credited with almost single-handedly creating ``Can
Lit,'' a new wave of writing set in Canada that also spelled
success for Margaret Laurence, Robertson Davies and Margaret Atwood.
   In a conversation at his makeshift office in an old YMCA
building, MacLennan, 81, said ``Two Solitudes'' is ``a book a
French-Canadian couldn't have written. They couldn't even do it
now. They're too close to it.''
   Questions draw a stream of observations from a man hooked on
history and the classics and has Thomas Wolfe and Gabriel Garcia
Marquez on his shelves and praises Hemingway as ``the American
Byron.''
   In quick succession, he says Canada is a nation founded by
losers but that's no bad thing; cites Aristotle's maxim that
``drama depends on the familiar''; theorizes that the fall of the
Roman Empire was due to currency devaluation, and praises Harry
Truman's fluency in Latin.
   Now collecting thoughts for a book of memoirs, MacLennan keeps a
surprisingly low profile for a man the Reader's Guide to the
Canadian Novel calls ``a writer of unique stature.''
   The Nova Scotia native lives with his invalid wife, Tota, in a
redbrick apartment building just below Mount Royal and takes a cab
most afternoons to the small office Concordia University puts at
his disposal.
   In a voice retaining the Gaelic lilt of his native Cape Breton,
as well as the rasp of a chain-smoker, MacLennan says he never made
much money from ``Two Solitudes'' after sacrificing royalties to
get it published. ``I only got 40 percent _ still do.''
   Seldom interviewed or mentioned on radio and TV, MacLennan has
published only seven novels and one book of essays in half a
century. ``I endlessly rewrite,'' he explains.
   But five of those novels won the country's highest literary
prize, the Governor General's Award, and ``Two Solitudes'' has been
translated into at least eight languages.
   Critics reserve their highest praise for later books such as
``Each Man's Son'' and ``The Watch That Ends The Night,'' but it is
``Two Solitudes'' that struck the strongest chord in both English
and French and was made into a movie.
   Built around French-Canadian aristocrat Athanase Tallard and his
son, Paul, the novel describes the clash between French Quebec,
with its almost medieval Catholicism, and the mercantile English
who once ran the province.
   ``I remember my publisher thought it would be too gloomy a
title, but I said no, leave it,'' said MacLennan, who recently
reread the book for the first time in years and concluded, ``It's
better than I thought.''
   The title came from a letter written by the German poet Rainer
Maria Rilke who said that even in love, there were two solitudes.
   MacLennan met an icy critical reception when he returned to the
subject of Quebec in his prophetic 1967 novel ``Return of the
Sphinx,'' which predicted separatist violence in the province with
fathers and sons on opposite sides.
   Three years later, he was vindicated when revolutionary violence
erupted, changing Quebec politics forever.
   ``I feel sympathy for these people,'' he says, referring to the
one-in-four Canadians who speak French at home. ``This continent is
never going to start speaking French.''
   He didn't anticipate the dramatic advances French-Canadians
would make by the 1980s, taking political and economic control of
their province, embracing the entrepreneurial spirit and breaking
the shackles of the priests.
   ``It was like lightning. They started going to college and
became more prosperous,'' says MacLennan, who arrived in Montreal
in 1935 to teach Latin and Greek at Lower Canada College boy's
school and has never left.
   He credits an old Montreal friend, former Prime Minister Pierre
Trudeau, with keeping the country together during Quebec's
separatist explosion and having the vision to build a more
tolerant, bilingual nation.
   ``Pierre was the only man who could have handled that situation
when it came. He's absolutely without peer,'' he says, adding with
a chuckle that Trudeau is also a mysterious fellow who in his youth
liked to drive around Montreal on a motorcycle wearing a German
helmet.
   The son of a Presbyterian doctor, the young MacLennan knew more
about Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union than he did his
own country after going to Oxford as a Rhodes scholar and using the
opportunity to travel across Europe.
   ``It was the best education I could ever have. For about a year
I thought I was a Communist but it didn't last long,'' he says,
echoing a theme explored with great understanding in his 1958
novel, ``The Watch That Ends The Night.''
   He recalls disillusionment on a Moscow visit in the 1930s when
commissars tried to claim that since the revolution, cows could be
milked four times a day.
   MacLennan met his American first wife, Dorothy, on the ship back
from Oxford and credits her with shaping his career. ``She really
woke me up to the fact that Canada was a different country than the
States.''
   Her slow death from heart disease is also the heroine's fate in
``The Watch That Ends The Night,'' which MacLennan completed as she
was dying.
   After his first two novels were rejected by publishers _ ``They
said he doesn't write like an American, and he doesn't write like
an Englishman'' _ MacLennan found his voice in 1941 with a story
set in Canada.
   ``Barometer Rising'' is a World War I saga based on a harrowing
moment in MacLennan's childhood, the Halifax explosion of 1917. He
narrowly escaped death when a French munitions ship filled with
explosives collided with a freighter in the harbor. It was the
largest non-nuclear explosion in history and killed more than 1,600
people.
   ``I was this far away from being beheaded,'' said the author,
cupping his hands 2 feet apart.
   It's eight years since the book MacLennan swears will be his
last novel, ``Voices in Time,'' which links Nazi Germany,
separatist Quebec and the world after a cataclysmic future conflict
dubbed ``the Destructions.''
   ``I spent 12 years writing it. I was lost in it. I finally came
to the conclusion that the most lethal people in the world are
politicians.''

   Game show veteran Alex Trebek, host of both
``Jeopardy'' and ``Concentration,'' sees a big difference in the
two television contests.
   ``Jeopardy'' contestants have to be smarter and the producers
are more fussy about who gets to play.
   ```Jeopardy' harks back to the quiz shows of the 1950s when you
had to have intelligence and skill,'' Trebek says. ``You need
brains, knowledge and quick reflexes.
   ```Concentration' is more of a traditional game show. The
contestants match numbers and then get a chance to solve a puzzle.
The important part is solving the puzzle, but getting a match lets
you see more of the puzzle.''
   ``Jeopardy'' is a quiz in which answers are provided in six
categories and the contestants must come up with the questions.
Each category has five answers, and the higher the prize money the
tougher the question.
   Seen on 191 stations around the country, ``Jeopardy'' is the
second-highest rated show in syndication, topped only by ``Wheel of
Fortune.''
   It's tough to get on ``Jeopardy.'' Game shows merely pick
contestants from the audience. Would-be contestants for
``Jeopardy'' must pass a battery of tests. After a written test,
contenders are matched against each other in a mock game to see how
they react to pressure and competition.
   Trebek, relaxing in the living room of his hillside bachelor
home, is wearing a pair of well-worn blue jeans and an old blue
jacket he got for participating in the Bill Cosby celebrity tennis
tournament in 1975.
   His house, overlooking the San Fernando Valley, has a high-tech
look of stark white walls and shiny metal surfaces. But his
collection of Chinese paintings and statuettes, religious icons,
carvings of African animals, other antiques and comfortable
furniture make it homey.
   Trebek grew up in Canada, where he got a degree in philosophy
from the University of Ottawa and worked 12 years for the Canadian
Broadcasting Corp. He had no desire to be a game show host, but
when Alan Thicke, a transplanted Canadian, offered him a job in the
United States as host of ``The Wizard of Odds'' he took it.
   That job lasted a year and he went on to ``High Rollers.'' He's
also been the host of ``The $128,000 Question,'' ``Double Dare''
and ``Battlestars.'' He's been with ``Jeopardy'' for four years and
``Concentration'' for a year.
   ``My real ambition,'' he says, ``is to get into production.
Producing `Jeopardy' for the last three years has whetted my
appetite. I think I can do it. It's just a question of finding the
right projects. I'll produce whatever. Movies for TV, series, game
shows.
   ``I've done a little acting, but you get typecast doing game
shows. Besides, I have a very tight schedule.''
   Trebek says he has learned that a contestant's education and
other background is no indication of how he or she will do on
``Jeopardy.''
   ``You get people from both sexes, from all kinds of
backgrounds,'' he says. ``Generally speaking, people who are bright
and about 30 years old will do best. Young people have quicker
reflexes and that counts on the show. People slow down as they grow
older. I know I have.''
   Trebek says he created a seniors tournament for people over 50
so that older people can compete against their peers. It will be
seen in May. Also a teen tournament is scheduled for February.
   Although many people play along at home, Trebek says the viewers
don't do as well as the contestants.
   ``It's the only show where the contestants are ahead of the
viewers,'' he says. ``With most game shows the people at home are
ahead. Still, it hooks people. They want to play the game. It's
best if there are a number of people watching. What good is it if
you know all the answers and there's nobody there to see you
triumph?''

   Scott Bakula took on a Broadway musical right
after he went into a prime-time television series, with the
understanding that it would be goodbye New York if the TV show
turned into a hit.
   Instead, ``Eisenhower & Lutz'' was canceled by CBS and ``Romance
Romance,'' a modest little musical that uses only four actors and
minimal scenery, has blossomed on Broadway.
   ``The timing was incredible,'' Bakula said the other day,
sitting in his dressing room at the Helen Hayes Theater. ``We
wrapped the series in mid-February and started rehearsals for
`Romance Romance' in March.
   ``I came into it saying, `I've got a TV series and may have to
go back in mid-June,''' he recalls. ``And the producers said,
`OK.'''
   ``Romance Romance,'' two separate one-act musicals, looks at
love in two very different places: turn-of-the-century Vienna and
trendy, modern-day East Hampton, Long Island.
   Bakula plays a rakish man about town in the first act and an
anguished yuppie contemplating an affair with a friend's wife in
the second.
   The show and Bakula were nominated for 1988 Tony awards. Neither
won, but the musical received national exposure on the Tony
telecast and has found a growing audience. A recording by MCA
Classics is scheduled for release in late summer.
   For Bakula, the recognition secured a stage reputation that
sprouted before he first went off to California to do television.
   The 33-year-old Bakula is one of those actors who looks at ease
in both mediums, although he says he is more comfortable on stage
than on television.
   ``I find the camera to be confining, but I've gotten over
that,'' he says. ``I tend to like to be physical on stage _ to move
and to do things.''
   Television requires a certain precision, he says _ hitting your
mark and then being still.
   ``How can you act?'' Bakula asks. ``But that's the trick of it
when you're coming from the theater. Now I'm used to it.''
   Bakula, who hails from St. Louis, found performing a part of his
life while growing up.
   ``I always sang and that led to doing theater,'' he says. He
went to the Univerity of Kansas to study business but later
switched to theater.
   ``I left school and came here to work in 1976, not study
theater,'' Bakula recalls. ``But I ended up studying my head off
all over town for years.''
   Still, Bakula had a job in show business the third day he was in
New York, although he had to leave town again to get it. The work
was in a dinner theater in North Carolina which was doing
``Shenandoah,'' a musical that supported him a lot during his first
years in New York.
   ``Whenever times got lean, it seemed like a company of
`Shenandoah' would come up,'' he says.
   The actor finally made it to Broadway in 1983, seven years after
arriving in New York. He survived ``Marilyn: an American Fable,'' a
short-lived and much-maligned musical based on the life of Marilyn
Monroe. In it, he played New York Yankee legend Joe DiMaggio, one
of Monroe's husbands.
   The troubled show, which had 13 producers listed above the
title, went through weeks of previews after the first director,
choreographer and leading lady were replaced.
   ``It was very frustrating,'' Bakula says now, ``but it was my
first Broadway show, so it also was very exciting.''
   The experience led Bakula almost immediately into a much happier
effort, ``3 Guys Naked from the Waist Down.'' The off-Broadway
musical, written by Michael Rupert and Jerry Colker, was a hip,
offbeat look at the world of stand-up comedians, one job in show
business Bakula had never tried.
   ``Now I know why people are stand-up comics,'' he says. ``When
you are really cooking, you feel like you can stay out there for
two hours, and they'll laugh at anything you say. It's a real heady
kind of feeling to be totally in control of an audience.''
   Bakula went west to appear in a Los Angeles production of the
off-Broadway musical ``Nite Club Confidential.'' He moved into
television with an occasional role on CBS' ``Designing Women'' as
Annie Potts' ex-husband and a major part in ABC's ``Gung Ho,''
which died quickly in a brutal time slot where it faced both
``Dallas'' and ``Miami Vice.''
   Bakula was cast as the fly-by-night lawyer in ``Eisenhower &
Lutz'' in July 1987 but the first episode wasn't filmed until
October. CBS didn't require a pilot because of the sterling
reputation of the show's producers, Alan Burns and MTM.
   The 13 episodes that eventually were made didn't set the
Nielsens afire, though the ratings had started to improve when the
show was canceled.
   ``I can't really explain what CBS did to the show,'' he says.
``We did everything they asked of us. We even got the 18- to
40-year-old audience that sponsors love.
   ``The network only has six half-hour shows on the schedule for
the fall,'' he adds. ``There were not that many slots to fill.''
   Fortunately, while in New York to publicize ``Eisenhower &
Lutz,'' Bakula did an informal audition for Keith Herrmann and
Barry Harman, the composer and director-lyricist of ``Romance
Romance.''
   ``I hadn't sung in a while and my voice was out of shape,'' he
says. But he got the job.
   ``It's kind of like a storybook ending,'' Bakula says ``We
survived opening night, which is a rarity these days, and then got
all those Tony nominations. And business has been getting better.
I'm not going anywhere else for a while.''

   The upcoming 1988 Olympics have become a symbol

   Forty years after its creation and 35
years after a devastating war, South Korea is trying to end decades
of authoritarian rule and build a stable democracy to match its
colossal economic achievements.
   South Korea, founded on Aug. 15, 1948, has become one of the
most modern and rapidly expanding economic powers in Asia, but its
politics have not changed as quickly.
   Despite liberal reforms in the last year, a powerful elite of
government bureaucrats, military commanders and business leaders
still dominates the nation, as it has for most of South Korean
history.
   Political leaders, analysts, intellectuals and others agree the
nation must build an enduring democratic system and stabilize its
turbulent politics if it is to find domestic peace and continue to
modernize and grow. The question is how.
   This nation of 41 million people also faces the challenge of
more fairly sharing the benefits of economic expansion. The
industrial workers who helped build and fuel the economy are
clamoring for change.
   The 1988 Olympic Games being held here in September will be
dramatic proof of how far South Korea has come since the Korean War
ended in an armistice in 1953. The war, which began with an
invasion by communist North Korea, left more than 1 million killed
and injured.
   North Korea still has not given up its hopes of reuniting Korea,
divided by U.S. and Soviet troops at the end of World War II.
   The two governments are locked in a bitter struggle for
supremacy on the peninsula, and both sides claim to be the sole
legitimate Korean government. Hundreds of thousands of troops face
each other in constant tension along a 150-mile demilitarized zone,
including 40,000 U.S. troops supporting the south.
   But signs of progress on the domestic political front and
tentative moves to reduce tension with the north have stirred hope
that South Korea can overcome its challenges.
   After decades of authoritarian rule by military and civilian
strongmen a desire for change sent hundreds of thousands of people
into the streets in the summer of 1987. The demonstrators ranged
from students to middle-class businessmen and forced President Chun
Doo-hwan, who seized power in a 1980 military coup, to agree to
elections and reforms.
   Roh Tae-woo, an ally of Chun who had backed the call for
reforms, won the presidential elections with a slender victory over
a divided opposition. Roh, a former general like Chun, took office
Feb. 25 in South Korea's first peaceful transfer of power.
   Roh, a mix of pragmatist and populist, promised to end decades
of authoritarian rule and usher in full democracy. ``Now nobody
will be able to reverse the current of democracy,'' Roh declared.
   South Korea has seen rapid liberal reforms during the past year.
Political, intellectual and artistic freedom has flowered with the
government no longer trying to regulate almost every aspect of life.
   Restrictions and controls on opposition groups, labor unions,
dissidents, the press and other groups have been lifted or reduced.
Most opposition groups operate freely after years of repression.
   Peaceful protests, strikes and political rallies have become
commonplace in a nation where a year ago riot police suppressed
almost all independent political activity.
   Roh, who cultivates a ``common man'' image, has gained growing
support for his programs. A recent poll said 53 percent of Koreans
approve of the president, but just 21 percent support his
Democratic Justice Party because of past abuses.
   Despite the recent changes, some observers fear the divisions
and antagonisms that have plagued South Korean politics for years
have not been resolved and the nation could again face chaos.
   Opposition groups are determined to end the governing elite's
power and insist they alone can build full democracy.
   Hardline opposition, dissident and labor groups claim Roh is a
front for military rule and say they won't end their struggle to
oust the administration. Radical students, a small but powerful
minority on campuses, continue to stage violent protests.
   Factionalism continues to dominate Korean politics with cliques
under autocratic leaders constantly struggling for power. Factions
are seen as a barrier to democracy because they do not tolerate
differing views and reject compromise as weakness.
   Some political leaders fear the political calm could end after
the Olympics. The opposition intends to keep Roh to his promise of
letting voters evaluate his performance after the Games.
   Opposition leaders want a referendum and say Roh must step down
if he loses. Government leaders say there can be no question of the
president surrendering power.
   Some officials say government hardliners have tolerated moderate
policies because they don't want to offend international opinion
when the Olympics focus world attention on South Korea. But the
hardliners may try to crack down on the opposition later, they say.
   While South Korea seeks political stability, it faces a related
challenge from workers, the poor and others for a much larger share
in the rewards of the economic success they helped create.
   South Korea grew from being one of the poorest Asian nations
with a gross national product of $1.8 billion in 1955 to a GNP of
$119 billion last year. Once almost dependent on foreign aid, Seoul
now has a $10 billion trade surplus with the United States and its
exports flood markets around the world.
   Industrial workers who produce the cars, electronic goods and
other items that have fueled the export boom want dramatic
improvements after decades of poor pay, Spartan lifestyles and long
work hours.
   The government, which in the past backed business and suppressed
labor groups, agrees there must be major changes. Roh has
encouraged business to work with workers and unions.
   ``High economic growth has been a national driving force, but
now attention must also be given to greater distribution of wealth
to help the needy,'' government Democratic Justice Party chairman
Yoon Giel-joong told The Associated Press.
   Some labor leaders contend the concessions are token and many
workers lead poor and bleak lives. They complain of cramped,
squalid housing, poor food and long, exhausting work hours in
dangerous and oppressive working conditions.
   The government rejects opposition claims that 25 percent of the
populations of Seoul and other cities live in poverty. Officials
say about 6 percent of city dwellers are below the official poverty
line of about $300 a month.
   ``The government underestimates the number of the poor to give
themselves legitimacy and to project Korea as a prosperous
nation,'' said Rev. Kim Kwang-soo, a dissident who helps the poor.
   Young Soo-gil, an economist at the Korea Development Institute,
said managers and workers must find a new relationship to increase
living standards without hurting productivity and exports by
driving up costs too much.
   ``It will take some doing,'' he said.

   While South Korea has developed into
one of Asia's success stories, North Korea is one of the world's
most engimatic nations.
   The north, occupying the top half of the 600-mile long
peninsula, is feared for its often wild, irrational policies and
its willingness to use violence against its opponents.
   North Korean President Kim Il Sung, now 76, rules with a
monolithic personality cult that teaches North Koreans to idolize
him.
   Giant statues of Kim, called ``Great Leader,'' dot the country,
the state-run media are filled with slavish praise of the president
and North Koreans are taught that he is loved around the world.
North Koreans generally wear badges bearing Kim's picture.
   ``The centralized control which demands total loyalty to the
leader has produced a pervasive and almost suffocating cult of
personality,'' the Institute of International Affairs in London
said in a recent report.
   Kim is attempting to build the world's first communist dynasty;
his son, Kim Jung Il, has been designated to succeed him. A
personality cult is also being built around the son, who is called
``Dear Leader.''
   The ruling Korean Workers Party enforces rigid control over all
aspects of life. Independent political groups or other
organizations are not tolerated, religion is outlawed and dissent
or opposition is suppressed.
   But the north faces mounting problems. Chronic mismanagement,
rigid state planning and massive military spending have crippled
the economy and there are reports of food shortages.
   North Korea in 1987 because the first nation ever to be declared
in default on its foreign loans by international banks. North
Korean diplomats have been caught selling drugs, liquor and watches
in Western Europe in desperate schemes to raise hard currency.
   The north invaded the south in 1950 to trigger the bloody Korean
War. It maintains the world's sixth largest army and has repeatedly
carried out terrorist attacks against the south.
   The north was blamed for the bombing of a Korean Air Lines
commercial airliner that crashed near Burma last Nov. 29, killing
115 people. The North Koreans deny any involvement.

   Here are some basic facts about South
Korea.
   POPULATION _ 41 million people.
   GEOGRAPHY _ A small, mountainous country about the size of
Indiana or England, South Korea occupies the southern half of the
Korean Peninsula jutting into the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea.
Its only border is with North Korea, but it iarby
China, the Soviet Union and Japan. The country has hot, humid
summers and very cold winters.
   GOVERNMENT _ A republic with a strong presidential system under
which s neighbor to nethe presidency initiates most programs and the prime
minister
and cabinet ministers have little power. The unicameral National
Assembly is playing a growing role.
   The country, dominated by political strongmen for most of its
history, had never had a peaceful transfer of power until Roh
Tae-woo succeeded Chun Doo-hwan as president in February. Chun, a
former general, took power with military backing in 1980.
   HISTORY _ Korea's history can be traced to at least the 1st
century B.C. Small rival kingdoms fought for control of the Korean
peninsula over the centuries, with China often dominating the area.
Japan seized the country in 1910 and proclaimed it a province.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Vibes''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' the Steven Spielberg@George Lucas
homage to the Saturday matinee serial, spawned a host of films in
the same genre, ranging from the good (``Romancing the Stone'') to
the poor (``The Golden Child'').
   Now comes ``Vibes,'' which lands somewhere in between.
   The new Columbia Pictures release most resembles ``Romancing the
Stone'' in that an antagonistic couple are thrown into a fortune
quest in the South American wilderness, falling in love along the
way. ``Vibes'' has some other attributes as well, including
stunning Ecuadorian scenery and the movie debut of rock superstar
Cyndi Lauper.
   The story begins promisingly in a Manhattan psychic lab operated
by Julian Sands (``Room with a View''). Among his subjects is Jeff
Goldblum, a museum worker who can reveal people's secrets by
touching their personal possessions, and Miss Lauper, a blond bimbo
who can foretell the future with the help of a spirit companion
named Lucille.
   The pair take an instant dislike for each other, and their
feelings intensify when they arrive in Ecuador. What are they doing
in Ecuador? Well, it seems that a shady character resembling the TV
detective Columbo has enlisted them to help find his lost son. Why
they would trust such a person is one of the many mysteries
contained in the script.
   Expectably, Peter Falk's ruse is exposed. What he is really
after is Incan treasure hidden for centuries in the Andes. The
search has already claimed two lives, but the lure of fortune has
still attracted thugs and adventurers who will use any means to
snatch it first.
   Such goings-on provide a reasonable basis for a high-tech,
action-adventure. So what goes wrong? For one thing, the leading
characters sound like vintage Damon Runyon, and the script writers,
Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, have supplied one-liners that only
now and then zing.
   Ken Kwapis directed with a good eye for action, but his actors
seldom shine. Goldblum, who has created a number of memorable
characters, is strangely restrained. Falk veers from the amusing to
the annoying.
   That brings us to the celebrated Miss Lauper. She is typecast as
the wise-cracking babe in search of a man, and her role seems to
duplicate Judy Holliday's Billie Dawn in ``Born Yesterday.''
   Yet there are no false notes in the singer's portrayal, and at
times she can be quite touching. A film career could be assured if
_ a big if _ she can slip into roles that depart from her music
videos.
   Deborah Blum and Tony Ganz produced ``Vibes,'' which is rated PG
for language and excitement. Running time: 99 minutes.

   ``Walker'' (MCA Home Video; VHS@Beta, $79.95; Rated R)
   
   ``Walker,'' based on a true story about an early American
incursion into Nicaragua, is one of those movies that flopped at
the box-office but sounds as if it might be an unappreciated gem
just waiting to be rediscovered on ideo.
   Unfortunately, even on the home screen, ``Walker'' is still a
flop _ though with its timely subject it can hardly fail to
generate some interest.
   The film, directed by Alex Cox, retells the story of William
Walker, a soldier of fortune who led a bloody invasion of Nicaragua
in the 1850s.
   Walker, as portrayed by Ed Harris, is a ruthless idealist, who
as he orders mass slaughters of civilians, mouths platitudes about
America's duty to ``protect our neighbors from oppression'' _ and
apparently believes what he's saying.
   According to the filmmakers, Walker sets out on his expedition
at the urging of Cornelius Vanderbilt, played here by Peter Boyle
as a flatulent, foul-mouthed old tyrant who wants to protect his
railroad line running through Nicaragua from rival nationalist
groups.
   The climax of the film is an impassioned speech Walker gives _
shortly before his one-man rule is toppled and he is executed _ in
which he tells the Nicaraguan people that ``America will never
leave you alone.''
   Chilling words, but Cox runs the contemporary angle into the
ground by littering the movie with deliberate anachronisms like
helicopters, cigarette machines and personal computers.
   Much of the dialogue and direction seems sloppy and confused,
and there hasn't been so much blood spilled on screen since ``The
Wild Bunch.''
   Oscar-winner Marlee Matlin has about five good minutes early on
as Walker's deaf girlfriend. But once she dies of cholera, both he
and the movie go downhill fast.

   ``The Lost Weekend,'' (MCA Home Entertainment; VHS@Beta, $59.95;
Not rated)
   
   It is fascinating and frightening to watch Ray Milland as the
literate, desperate alcoholic Don Birnam in ``The Lost Weekend.''
His performance earned him an Academy Award in Billy Wilder's 1945
movie, which also was named best picture.
   Milland and Jane Wyman are the film's stars, but alcohol is the
main character.
   Taken from the Charles Jackson novel of the same name, ``The
Lost Weekend'' shows three days in Birnam's life _ horrible drunken
days when Birnam sinks to the depths of his soul, tormented by his
failure as a writer.
   He rummages madly through his brother's apartment in search of a
bottle of whiskey he himself hid but lost, trudges relentlessly
through Manhattan in search of an open shop to pawn his typewriter.
In one of the film's saddest moments, he chooses a sip from his
tumbler of liquor over the kiss of Helen (Wyman), who loves him.
   Still, Birnam, who talks of writing a novel called ``The
Bottle,'' is witty and eloquent. Drink, he tells a bartender, may
shrink his liver and pickle his kidney. ``But what does it do to my
mind? It tosses the sandbags overboard so the balloon can soar.''
   It makes no difference that the movie is 43 years old, or that
it's in black and white _ even today there could be no more
persuasive advertisement against alcohol abuse.

<HEAD>Helmets Urged To Protect Children In Bicycle-Mounted Child Seats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Children who ride along in bicycle-mounted seats
should wear approved, crash-tested safety helmets, experts say as a
growing number of children are being seriously injured in cycling
accidnts.
   In a study of injuries to bicycle passengers, Dr. James Sargent,
a pediatrician at Boston City Hospital, found that 65 percent of
the injuries to children in bicycle-mounted child seats are to the
head and face.
   ``The reason for that preponderance of head injuries, we
believe, is that these seats put children high off the ground, and
that when the bicycle falls over, the child's head is the highest
part of the whole bicycle.
   ``You combine that with the fact that toddlers don't have much
head control. Their heads are heavy in relation to their bodies,
and they don't have the muscle development an older child has,''
Sargent said.
   California Highway Patrol records of bicycle-related injuries
and deaths to children under age 6, from 1977 to 1986, showed that
the number of injuries to cyclists remained relatively constant.
But injuries to passengers jumped from 17 percent of the total in
1977 to 28 percent in 1986.

   An optical telescope destined to float
next year from a space shuttle orbiting beyond the haze of
atmosphere will let scientists peer into the depths of the universe
and 14 billion years intothe past.
   In orbit, the Edwin P. Hubble Space Telescope should see seven
times as far as the 2 billion light years of the most powerful
earth-bound telescopes.
   First scheduled for an August 1986 launch, it so far hasn't
looked at anything. It sits in a windowless room, wrapped in
silvery thermal blankets, running up bills.
   After the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger accident halted the shuttle
program, a NASA official told Congress the telescope would be
expensive to ``baby-sit.''
   ``Baby-sit makes it sound like the telescope's sitting there,
all ready to go,'' said Bert Bulkin, director of scientific space
programs here at Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. Inc. ``You put it
in the cocoon, and just before flight take it out of the cocoon and
fly it. Well, that's not the case.''
   Beyond $1.5 billion to build the telescope, the cost of
continuing work during the first 30 months of delay will reach $400
million, according to NASA project manager Fred S. Wojtalik. Faulty
devices installed originally have led to dozens of alerts and
driven up costs by as much as $10 million a year.
   That's for a project approved in 1977 at $572 million.
   The telescope was built to work in the vacuum of space and must
be protected from even minute amounts of dust, moisture and noise.
Its 94.5-inch primary mirror has been kept virtually free of
contamination.
   In the ``clean room,'' giant fans cleanse the air through
filters that can screen particles 200 times thinner than a hair.
The 350 scientists, engineers, computer experts and others
attending the craft must wear uncomfortable white ``bunny suits,''
masks and rubber gloves; anyone entering must be covered completely
and pass through an air shower.
   The 42-foot-tall, 25,000-pound, aluminum-framed spacecraft has
been taken apart and almost put back together in preparation for
shipping in November to Cape Canaveral via the Panama Canal. The
scientific instruments, designed to be serviced every three to five
years in space, have been pulled out more than a dozen times for
inspections, repairs and improvements.
   The Hubble got a clean bill of health two years ago after what
Bulkin calls ``57 nightmarish days'' of around-the-clock testing
using extreme cold and heat to simulate space. The longer it sat on
the ground, though, the more problems it developed.
   ``We had alerts coming out of the bazoo,'' Bulkin said.
   When a part fails, an alert is signaled and contractors of other
devices using that part are notified. Reams of computer printouts
have to be analyzed.
   ``If it's a problem like the thermostats, where six out of about
150 of them were bad, and you're sitting on the launch pad, you
replace the bad ones and go,'' he said. ``If you have time, like
we've had for the last two years, then you pull the boxes and fix
them all.''
   Defective thermostats and resistors were replaced and more
efficient solar cells and batteries added.
   For its 17-day trip to Florida, the telescope will be placed in
a 27-by-19-by-60-foot, hermetically sealed, steel container, moved
by barge to the Oakland Army Terminal across San Francisco Bay in
Alameda and be loaded on a ship.
   ``There is a lot of anxiety about the move. The canal is not the
safest area,'' said Bulkin. ``Every time you lift it up, you're
sitting there and your heart goes `Boom! Boom! Boom!' I'm not going
to be happy until it's in orbit from the time it leaves here.''
   In the future, such telescopes will be moved by a specially
modified Army transport plane, but the plane won't be ready in time.
   Meanwhile, budget-minded officials aren't the only ones
concerned about the delay. So are astronomers and the European
Space Agency, which paid 15 percent of the building costs and
provided the sophisticated faint object camera.
   The International Astronomical Union decided five years ago to
hold its 1988 meeting in Baltimore, near the Goddard Space Flight
Center in Greenbelt, which is managing the Hubble instruments,
mission operations and data.
   ``It was to be the centerpiece of the meeting. They expected to
have their first views ready by now,'' said Lisa Hooker, a
spokeswoman for Johns Hopkins University, which was host for the
assembly last week.
   ``We're all frustrated by having to wait so long, but it's going
to be fantastic fun when it's in orbit,'' said Jim Westphal,
professor of planetary science at California Institute of
Technology and a principal investigator on the telescope. ``I
suspect we're going to find many amazing things that will thrill
the public, not once a year but maybe once a week.''
   The Hubble is named after an American astronomer who used the
100-inch Hooker Telescope in Pasadena to examine stars in the
Andromeda Galaxy, the first conclusive proof of galaxies other than
our Milky Way.
   The space telescope is smaller than many land-based
observatories, but should transmit much sharper images because it
will be stationed more than 350 miles above the distorting effects
of the atmosphere. It also will be able to make images in the
ultraviolet or black spectra that can't be made on Earth.
   Telescopes that follow the Hubble into orbit will study X-rays,
gamma rays and infrared radiation.
   The new view of the universe scientists for, Westphal said, is
similar in impact to the vision a very nearsighted person would get
by putting on glasses for the first time. ``I'm prejudiced, but I
think it is well worth the money because it will help solve some of
the puzzles man has wondered about for thousands of years,'' he
said.
   ``I'll let you know after it sends back some pictures,'' Bulkin
said.
   Astronomers plan to look for evidence of planets in other solar
systems, study planets in our solar system in greater detail,
search for ``black holes'' in galaxies and measure the distance
between stars more accurately.
   They will try, too, for a better understanding of the origins
and possible fate of the universe as they gaze at light that took
14 billion years to get here _ close to the beginning of time in
the universe.
   Scientists will be able to explore a region 350 times larger
than they can, said Italian astrophysicist Duccio Macchetto.
   ``Looking far away means going back in time,'' Macchetto said.
``We hope to go back to those periods in which galaxies and quasars
were formed.''

<HEAD>Ultrasound Can Serve As Baby's First Checkup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAR HARBOR, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Baby should have his first checkup,
some experts believe, about five months before birth.
   ``All women should have careful ultrasound in the fourth month
of pregnancy as though it is the baby's first physical exam,'' said
Dr. Judith G. Hall of the University of British Columbia.
   ``Most people think about prenatal diagnosis as preparatory to
early termination'' of the pregnancy, said Hall. ``But really it's
not. It allows us to begin early treatment.''
   Doctors may recommend abortion if ultrasound finds a severe
defect, but this isn't always the case.
   Ultrasound, in which the echoes of sound waves make pictures of
the fetus inside the womb, often is a routine part of prenatal
care, but Hall believes it can be employed much more effectively to
thoroughly examine a growing fetus.
   ``Some of us in the business of doing high-risk obstetrical
ultrasound can probably pick up most of the major congenital
abnormalities,'' agreed Dr. Beryl R. Benacerraf, a radiologist at
Harvard Medical School.
   About 5 percent of babies have significant congenital
malformations, physical defects present at birth that require
extensive treatment or change a child's life. While the newborn
death rate has fallen dramatically over the years, the liklihood of
serious birth defects has not changed.
   At a recent genetics conference at the Jackson Laboratory here,
Hall contended that at least half of all these birth defects could
be spotted before birth through ultrasound exams.
   Benacerraf has shown that doctors can accurately identify
fetuses with Down's syndrome by looking for thighbones that are
slightly shorter than usual and an extra roll of skin on the back
of the neck.
   Even though many women already have ultrasound during pregnancy,
Hall said it is not ordinarily used to take a careful look at the
unborn child's health. Instead, it is primarly intended to measure
the size of the baby's head and the length of his arms so
physicians can determine how old the fetus is.
   Among other things, she said, ultrasound can be used to check
the severity of osteogenesis imperfecta, a birth defect in which
the child suffers broken bones. The scan can help determine whether
the child would benefit from Caesarean section to avoid fractures
during birth.
   Ultrasound can also help spot fetal heart block, a condition in
which the fetus's heart fails to beat strongly enough. This
condition can be treated before birth by giving the mother
digitalis.
   Benacerraf said she believes all pregnant women should have
ultrasound, but she cautioned that many doctors are not trained to
spot birth defects.
   Physicians who have so-called level one training, she said,
``are just getting a couple of measurements and counting heads,''
while those with more sophisticated skills look for the often
subtle signs of abnormalities.
   Benacerraf said a major study, sponsored by the National
Institutes of Health, is trying to determine whether routinely
doing the more sophisticated ultrasound is worth the expense, which
is between $150 and $300. But even if it turns out to make economic
and medical sense on a large scale, it will not immediately be
available everywhere.
   ``There are not that many people trained in this field,'' she
said. ``If, all of a sudden, we decided to scan everybody who's
pregnant, we couldn't possibly handle the volume.''

<HEAD>Pen-Raised Bears Released To Test Survival Skills</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ELIZABETHTON, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mama bear is a crowd-pleaser,
especially with a roly-poly cub romping at her side. But what's a
zoo to do when baby grows up?
   Too often, surplus pen-reared black bears are sold, traded to
dubious buyers or killed, and the mother bred again so zoo visitors
won't be robbed of the baby bear experience, said Michael Pelton, a
wildlife science professor.
   Pelton, of the University of Tennessee, and Doug Scott of the
Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency are tracking radio-collared
bears released from zoo areas into the Cherokee National Forest.
   Pen-raised black bears have been used in research in Tennessee,
but ``this is the first time we've made a concerted effort to keep
track of them,'' Pelton said. ``We want to learn more about how
they react to a new environment after having been born in
captivity...''
   ``The main thrust of the study is to determine simply if these
animals will make it in the wild and if they're suitable for
release,'' Scott said. ``That's the big question. Should we even
take these bears off the hands of zoos, or should we just allow
them to be bought and sold?''
   Six bears, wearing radio collars, have been released, three each
from the Ober Gatlinburg and Grandfather Mountain resort zoos. One
bear grew dependent on area residents for ice cream and other food
handouts. When the zoo that had housed it declined to take it back,
the bear had to be killed. The resort later relented and took back
another bear after similar problems arose, Scott said.
   A third bear was found dead in the forest. Foul play is
suspected and an autopsy is pending. Radio contact has been lost
with a fourth bear.
   Despite the problems, neither Pelton nor Scott is ready to give
up.
   About 20 pen-raised black bears have been released into the wild
in Tennessee over the last 10 to 15 years, but without radio
collars there's no way of knowing their whereabouts, Pelton said.
   In the past, tattoos and ear tags were used on pen-raised bears.
At least three have turned up dead as the result of legal hunts,
which tells researchers they managed to adapt, at least to nature.
   The handling of bears in captivity has a lot to do with their
odds of making it in the wild, Pelton said. Often, they're fed
dried dog food rather than berries and acorns, and are given treats
by zoo visitors. Neither practice boosts their chances of adapting.
   In addition, their cages are sometimes bereft of places to climb
and hide, a more natural environment, and they're allowed too much
contact with humans.
   Several years ago, the state prohibited the caging of Tennessee
black bears in areas other than bona fide zoos or zoological parks.
The law doesn't require special diets or cages to help the bears
survive in the wild if the need arose.
   ``My hope is that the state game people say to the people who
generate these animals, `We need to do a,b,c and d. Otherwise, we
can't work with you,''' Pelton said.

<HEAD>Space Telescope Running Up Big Bills Waiting For Delayed Launch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SUNNYVALE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Edwin P. Hubble Space Telescope is
to float next year from a space shuttle beyond the haze of
atmosphere to let scientists peer into the depths of the universe
and 14 billion years into the past.
   It should see seven times as far as the most powerful
earth-bound scopes.
   Originally scheduled for August 1986 launch, it so far hasn't
looked at anything. It sits wrapped in silvery thermal blankets,
running up bills.
   Beyond $1.5 billion to build it, the cost of work during the 30
months of delay since the Challenger explosion will reach $400
million, NASA says. Faulty devices have driven up costs by as much
as $10 million a year.
   That's for a project envisioned in 1977 as costing $572 million.
   The telescope must be protected from even minute amounts of
dust, moisture and noise. In the ``clean room,'' giant fans cleanse
the air through filters that can screen particles 200 times thinner
than a hair.
   The 42-foot-tall spacecraft has been taken apart and almost put
back together in preparation for shipping in November to Cape
Canaveral. Scientific instruments, designed to be serviced every
three to five years in space, have been out more than a dozen times
for inspections, repairs and improvements.
   Meanwhile, budget-minded officials aren't the only ones
concerned about the delay. So are astronomers and the European
Space Agency, which paid 15 percent of the building costs and
provided a sophisticated faint object camera.
   Data from the Hubble was to be the centerpiece of the
International Astronomical Union's 1988 meeting, scheduled five
years ago and held last week in Baltimore. The Goddard Space Flight
Center in nearby Greenbelt, Md., is managing the instruments,
mission operations and data.
   The Hubble, named for an American astronomer who provided the
first proof of others than our Milky Way, is smaller than many
land-based telescopes, but should give sharper images because it
will be 350 miles above the atmosphere.
   Astronomers will look for evidence of planets in other solar
systems, study planets in our solar system in more detail, search
for black holes and measure the distance between stars more
accurately. They will try, too, for a better understanding of the
origins and possible fate of the universe.

<HEAD>Algae Could Lead to Agricultural Economies In Arid Areas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DURHAM, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Algae growing in ponds in the Israeli desert
could lead to new products to bring agriculture to arid regions.
   ``We are seeding plants that would never grow in the desert,''
said Duke University botanist Joseph Ramus. ``This project is in
its infancy. What we are developing now will come to fruition in
the year 2000 and later.''
   Ramus and Ben Gurion University researchers are growing algae in
labs and transferring them to ponds in the Valley of Arava in the
Negev. The ponds, fed by fossil water from 3,000-foot wells, each
hold a different type of algae.
   They also are growing Saint Peter fish in the ponds. The fish
produce nitrogen to help the algae grow and bring a good price at
market. ``Aquaculture of Saint Peter fish is becoming a big
industry there. It's a real delicacy for them,'' Ramus said. ``One
fish is enough for a meal. It's like the catfish or crawfish
industry in the Southeast.''
   The algae can be used to produce beta carotene, a source of
Vitamin A; phycolloids, which are food thickeners; and
biliproteins, which can be used in food colorings, he said.

<HEAD>Marsh Grass Research Aimed At Preventing Coastal Erosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN MEADOW, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers in this small town are
watching the grass grow _ and hoping to protect coastal wetlands
from wind, waves and development that erode thousands of acres a
year.
   The grass grown on 11 acres of ponds aren't protected from
disease or weather, they're not fertilized and the only thing out
of the ordinary they get is a daily dose of saltwater, from pumps
that simulate the tide.
   U.S. Soil Conservations Service researchers hope the smooth
cut-grass, giant cut-grass and gulf cord grass will prevent the
coastal erosion that takes some 32,000 acres a year of Louisiana's
3.2 million acres of coastal wetlands.
   A tough, reedy carpet of such marsh grass can form a natural
barrier against tides, waves, wind and the effects of dredging
canals and exploring for oil while the roots hold the soil in
place, said the agency's Jack Cutshall.
   The project began in 1984 on land owned by the Louisiana Land
and Exploration Co., an oil and gas company, and researchers expect
to know within a year what types are promising and within five
years those that are suitable for seed production and aerial
seeding projects.
   ``We've learned an awful lot with these plants,'' Cutshall said.
``There was virtually no information on how gulf cord grass grows,
so we've done some original work there. And we've done some
original work on smooth cut-grass.''
   What remains, he said, ``is to find a plant that has the best of
everything.''

<HEAD>Heating Young Chickens Can Make Them Heat-Resistant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chickens die during heat waves because
they can't sweat, but heating chicks seems to make them more
resistant as adults, says a researcher who doesn't have ``the
foggiest idea'' why.
   Chickens exposed to 95 to 100 degree temperatures when they are
5 days old, and again when they are 6 weeks old, seem to have a
survival rate 70 percent to 95 percent better than unheated
chickens, said Michael Denbow, a Virginia Tech associate professor
of poultry science. ``It's kind of neat.''
   Asked how it works, he said, ``We don't have the foggiest idea.''
   Chickens cool off by panting, which evaporates water through
their respiratory systems, said Denbow, who has spent three years
testing the birds. Broilers are usually ready for market at about
six to seven weeks.

<DATELINE>HIGH POINT, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After last year's record growth,
furniture industry analysts projected business would flatten out in
1988.
   So far, their projections are on the mark. But that doesn't mean
the furniture manufacturers, many of them in North Carolina, are
sitting on their hands.
   Faced with the industry's first prolonged no-growth period since
1982, the manufacturers are developing innovative ways to attract
retailers and consumers.
   Some are pushing new furniture lines to catch the eyes of
potential customers. Others are working to improve services. Prices
have been sharpened and new marketing strategies devised.
   ``The people who will be successful will do their homework, come
out with some new lines and sharpen their pricing,'' said High
Point designer Randy Culler.
   Culler, who designs furniture for 10 different companies, feels
it will take good business acumen rather than exotic designs if
manufacturers are to entice consumers to buy as they did in 1987.
   ``I've always said 80 percent of what we do is merchandising and
20 percent (is) design,'' he said in an interview.
   William DiPaolo, vice president of the Southern Furniture Market
Center in High Point, said the business slowdown during the first
few months of this year caused some difficulties for some factories.
   ``Their cash flow has become squeezed,'' he said in an
interview. ``We might start seeing some shorter work weeks.''
   Marty Reddan, an economist for the American Furniture
Manufacturers Association, said shipments and orders from factories
to retailers have been flat this year, when compared with the
record levels of a year ago.
   First quarter shipments, measured by units, were up less than 1
percent over the same period in 1987, he said.
   Jerry Epperson, a furniture industry analyst with Wheat, First
Securities, a Richmond, Va., brokerage house, said the reductions
could lead to shorter work weeks and smaller backlogs in orders.
   ``It's not that business is not clipping along at a good rate,''
he said. ``Retailers are not ordering as far in advance because the
backlogs aren't as large. Business in the popular price points has
been tough most of the year. But it's more complicated than to just
say consumers aren't buying furniture.''
   Epperson said many furniture retailers have been struggling to
comply with the federal tax reforms of 1986. No longer can they pay
their taxes on an installment basis and defer some payments, he
said.
   ``Now they have to pre-pay the government before taking out of
their inventories,'' he said. ``They are less generous in credit
terms and stricter in inventories.
   ``We've seen a year of significant inventory liquidation,''
Epperson said.
   Reddan stressed that 1987 was a record year for shipments and
orders.
   ``You must remember that employment is at an all-time high in
the furniture industry,'' he said. ``Flat is very good _ a lot
better than some people had feared.''
   Until last October's stock market crash, optimism was strong in
North Carolina, the nation's leading producer of household goods.
In 1987, manufacturers shipped nearly $15.8 billion worth of
furniture, a 10 percent increase over 1986. Retail sales last year
advanced 5 percent to $27.2 billion.
   Topping those figures is difficult when the growth in the
national economy has slowed, especially when new home starts,
housing resales and interest rates also reflect a slowdown over
1987.
   ``It will be a flat year at retail, down between 3 to 5 percent
below last year in unit terms,'' Epperson said.
   Prior to last April's Southern Furniture Market in High Point,
some analysts were predicting that manufacturers would bring out
many new product lines to generate business.
   Epperson said that didn't turn out to be the case.
   ``If anything, many factories are cutting back on the number of
items they offer,'' he said. ``When you produce 600 sofas at one
time, the cost is less.''
   Many manufacturers are working to strengthen their relationship
with a smaller number of retailers by providing better services _
such as accelerated delivery, guaranteed delivery or better credit
terms, Epperson said.
   Richard Barentine, executive director of the Furniture
Factories' Marketing Association of the South, said prospects are
picking up for the fall furniture market.
   ``If interest rates remain stable as well as housing starts, and
consumer demand is strong, we'll be OK,'' he said.
   Barentine said many manufacturers have decided to stay with
successful lines rather than try to push new ones. They also follow
consumer preference _ for example, in case goods.
   ``They're willing to pay and in return they demand high
quality,'' Barentine said.
   Judith Cushman, of Furniture Today, a trade publication based in
High Point, said she doesn't anticipate that manufacturers will
respond to sluggish sales by introducing more new lines of
furniture than they usually do at the twice-yearly markets in High
Point.
   ``I don't think we can say across the board there will be a lot
of innovation in order to boost sales,'' she said.

   One controversial furniture industry
marketing tool has become the focus of a lawsuit filed by 13 North
Carolina retailers against Thomasville Furniture Industries, which
implemented a policy in April restricting catalog and telephone
sales.
   To continue as dealers of Thomasville's high-end products,
Thomasville said, its 51 retailers in North Carolina must install a
gallery. Like other manufacturers, Thomasville started a gallery
program in 1982 in which its furniture is displayed in a room-like
setting.
   ``It's a period of adjustment,'' said Judith Cushman, of
Furniture Today, a trade publication. ``The gallery alignment is a
challenge facing the industry. It creates a strong relationship
between the manufacturer and the retailer.''
   Ms. Cushman said many smaller stores are reluctant to devote
valuable floor space to one manufacture's furniture. The result is
fewer dealers selling the products, she said.
   In Thomasville's case, it was a profitable move. In 1982,
Thomasville reported sales of $130 million through 4,000 retailers.
Last year, the number of dealers stood at 555 _ with sales at $260
million.
   However, the 13 plaintiffs allege that restrictions on telephone
and catalog sales violate antitrust laws. The 13 are among 40 North
Carolina retailers that have signed up for the program.

   Does it require a really experienced decorator to get the
maximum decorating mileage out of a dollar?
   Not at all, say designers Mary Meehan and Robert Metzger, who
have come up with a few top-drawer ideas that wouldn't cost all
that much.
   Although both ignored budgetary constraints this spring in rooms
they decorated at New York's Kips Bay Showhouse, they were able to
suggest some low-cost, quick-fix ideas for imparting special style
to your home.
   ``Cost is irrelevant,'' says Miss Meehan, a New York designer
whose clients usually can afford not to pay much attention to the
expense. It is the unexpected that makes for interest, not the
dollars, she says.
   ``In my house in Southampton (Long Island, N.Y.), I have a lot
of junk furniture from second-hand stores that I've painted,'' she
says. ``Put that junk in a room with one thing that's really good _
a rug, painting, chair, armoire, for example _ and it will still
look terrific.''
   She says you can find the money for the splurge item by saving
in other places. ``I prefer to buy an old sofa and put a slipcover
on it and then spend the difference on something with value and
impact,'' she says.
   Another factor that distinguishes rooms created by good
designers, she says, is attention to detail. ``Details make the
difference between a room that look well-planned and one that
doesn't. People notice, but they don't know that they do.''
   An example is to upgrade the lampshades. ``You can turn ordinary
lampshades into custom wonders with store-bought dye and commercial
trims applied with glue,'' she says.
   For about $35, she created a shade by dyeing a plain white
lampshade a very pale pink and then applying a fringe trim in pink
and green at the base and a thinner braid trim with the same colors
at the top. It took only a few minutes and less than a yard of
trim, she says, to create something that would cost about $200 if
custom-made.
   ``Many people are afraid to do things that are not formula,''
says Miss Meehan. ``That is what decorators do. Until they actually
see it in place, they don't know for sure if their choices will
work together. I don't care how good you are. The very best
decorators try some things that won't work and they take them out.''
   Designer Metzger advises dealing with bad walls by slipcovering
them in inexpensive fabric. He seams fabric top and bottom and then
installs it in ready-made hardware that fastens to the ceiling or
wall. Or he uses Velcro fasteners on the wall and fabric, or simply
staples the fabric to the wall.
   Metzger says that sheeting and remnants you can buy for 99 cents
a yard work as well as more costly fabrics and the effect can
completely change the room.
   If cost is a factor, he says, disguise the bad condition of wood
and concrete floors with paint.
   When carpeting a stairway, paint stripes to the left and right
of the carpeted tread to create the illusion of a costly border
treatment.
   To create height and emphasize a mood of grandeur at windows, he
suggests hanging curtains right at the ceiling line. If the
preferred treatment is a shade, it, too, can be hung above the
actual window.
   If you need substantially more storage room, don't overlook the
possibility of converting the unused space under a staircase,
Metzger says. Remove the sheetrock surround and install shelves.
Then cover the space with a hinged door and different sheetrock or
pull-up panels. He suggests painting or wallpapering it to match
the rest of the room.

   Nature provides the outdoor beauty of a landscape, but only you
can improve your indoor view with an eye-catching wallscape or
tablescape.
   Surround that single photo on the wall or the single vase on the
table with complementary objects such as candles, flowers and
souvenirs, suggests Bette Rosenberg, home fashions director for
Spiegel, catalog marketer and merchandiser.
   ``The most important thing to remember when designing a `scape'
is to include the things you love,'' she says.
   For a wallscape, she says, try to gather wall pieces of
different sizes and shapes, such as paintings in round, square and
rectangular frames. Keep the larger and heavier items at the bottom
of the wallscape _ and visualize the result by arranging them on
the floor before hanging them on the wall.
   When creating a tablescape, says Rosenberg, gather items such as
small photographs, lace, candlesticks, dried flowers and silver
trinkets and arrange them in alternating shapes and sizes. Drape
lace over the table to soften the look.
   Tablescapes, she says, can change as often as a mood _ and the
objects don't have to be nailed down.
   Wallscapes and tablescapes can be complementary, if they are
near each other, Rosenberg says.
   ``If you coordinate the colors, you're halfway there. For a more
complete picture, try repeating an object in a painting on the
table. If there's a candle in the painting, put a candle on the
table.
   ``Make sure objects on the wall don't overwhelm objects on the
table. All of the items should be in proportion to one another.''

   One picture may be worth a thousand words, but in today's
decorating climate, the frame may be more valuable than the picture.
   The Professional Picture Frames Association reports an increase
of interest in elaborate frames as well as a trend toward framing
everything from needlepoint and family heirlooms to mementoes and
memorabilia.
   The Lazarus department store in Columbus, Ohio, recently opened
a frame shop next to its stationery department to handle the
increased interest in framed photographs as a decorative accessory.
   A new book, ``Displaying Pictures and Photographs,'' offers
guidance on aesthetic and practical issues in framing, arranging
and lighting art works.
   Caroline Clifton-Mogg, co-author of the book, with Piers
Feethman, says selecting the right frame is not a simple matter;
each instance is unique. Frames can not only show off the art work
to best advantage, but can add luster to insignificant works.
   Until recently, it was considered most appropriate to hang
pictures against a white wall. Now, pictures may hang against
patterned wallpaper or a decorated and colored wall surface.
   Busy backgrounds, however, need strong pictures and frames.
Choose pictures that complement the decorative period of the room,
or introduce a color of the wallpaper in the mat or frame
surrounding the artwork.
   For the best arrangement for framed artwork, says Miss
Clifton-Mogg, consider the style and mood of the room or area in
which the work will hang, as well as the relationship of the mat
and frame to the rest of the decor.
   In a small room with low ceilings, for example, don't hang
several large pictures close together. Dark walls are good
backdrops for monochrome works, line pen and ink drawings, or
strong linear architectural prints.
   When hanging pictures over or near furniture, relate the frames
and subject matter to the furniture, perhaps aligning them in a
symmetrical arrangement by matching the two woods or by tying the
mat to the upholstery color.
   If your double bed lacks a headboard, hang a large picture or
group of pictures above the bed. Make sure the edges of the picture
don't extend beyond the edges of the furniture beneath it.
   When a picture is hung alone, it should be at eye level; when it
is part of a group, choose a darker, broader or heavier-looking
frame to give extra weight to one element.
   A group of framed artworks may be improved by exploiting an
interplay of shapes, says Miss Clifton-Mogg. Introduce a circle,
oval or lozenge shape among the squares and rectangles for a
surprisingly dramatic effect.
   Framed family photographs often are displayed on a table or
mantel in a mix of old and new frames. And, often, small
knick-knacks are mixed in a style that is particularly appealing in
country-style rooms.
   Photographs and small works also are hung in hallways and
staircases.
   The Professional Picture Framers Association offers these tips
to protect the artwork:
   _ Use acid-free matting and adhesives to prevent deterioration.
   _ If framing needlework, have it mounted so it can be removed
without harming the needlework. Lacing is one such method.
   _ For three-dimensional objects, such as medals, use ultraviolet
glass to protect art from the sun's rays.

   If you're thinking of updating your bathroom, you're among an
estimated 7 percent of American households with similar plans.
   A survey in late 1987 for the trade magazine Kitchen and Bath
Business indicated that between 5.2 million and 6.5 million baths
would be remodeled during 1988. The 25,000 consumers surveyed
showed the total dollar outlay for the remodeling would range from
$8.9 billion to $11.6 billion, says Ed Pell, executive editor.
   Last year, consumers spent $8.3 billion on bath remodeling by
professionals. About 70 percent remodeled a master bath; 41 percent
remodeled another bath; 21 percent remodeled a half-bath, and 7
percent added a master bedroom bath. Thirteen percent added a full
bath and 8 percent added a powder room. Nine percent enlarged an
existing bath.
   ``For many years, almost no one paid any attention to the
bath,'' says Pell. ``It was strictly a utility area and the focus
was to get all the equipment into the smallest possible space.''
   Now, he says, the bath has become a kind of focus of the
two-person household.
   Typically, he says, between $3,000 and $6,000 is spent to redo a
bath, although many jobs are on a much smaller scale. For $300, he
says, consumers may put in a new sink or new faucets, a new vanity
or mirrored medicine cabinet. In general, people want heaters,
ventilation equipment, skylights _especially in windowless baths
and in baths with small windows _ and cabinetry for more storage.
   The more expensive remodelings may substitute a whirlpool for a
standard bath, or add exercise equipment, even a small
refrigerator, cooktop and bar sink.
   New York interior designer Nina Hughes says some clients want a
luxurious bath with a whirlpool or steam shower and amenities
ranging from heated towel racks and extra heaters to bidets,
piped-in music and lighting on dimmers.
   ``The transformation of the bath into a luxury room is partly a
result of interest in fitness, partly a response to stressful
times,'' she says. ``Some people have the disposable income to
create a spa environment at home. It's less expensive than actually
going to a spa and home hydrotherapy can be justified as a luxury
because it has a health component.''
   Her biggest problem as a designer, she says, is space. ``What
people want in a bathroom today takes more than 5-by-7 feet,'' she
says. She advises increasing space by invading another room or
taking a closet.
   Among the more popular new bath additions, she says, is a steam
shower with a folding seat. She may hide the steam generator and
controls in a vanity so the unit looks like an ordinary stall
shower.
   One company makes a prefabricated sauna that fits into a space
just less than 4 feet square. According to Finnleo, which imports
the dry-heat units from Scandinavia, no plumbing and little
carpentry is required if the space is available. Cost is about
$2,000.
   If the addition of all this equipment leads to a closed-in
feeling, mirrors can expand visual space and recessing storage
units can help alleviate the problem.

   Redecorating with wallcoverings has become a popular
do-it-yourself project and manufacturers are encouraging the trend
by offering more coordinated patterns and borders in wallpaper
books.
   At the retail level, many shops offer guidance on how to hang
the covering and what types of adhesives to use.
   Retailers suggest you order all the wallcoverings you need at
the same time so they are all from the same color run.
   Before starting the job, check the lot numbers before unwrapping
the rolls and inspect the full length of each roll before you cut
it. If there are damaged rolls, return them.
   Consider what is on the walls in adjacent rooms before deciding
on color and pattern. You can choose a covering in a similar color,
with the same pattern scale or with the same ``feeling'' in mind,
such as a small floral pattern that coordinates with a larger,
bolder floral in the same colors.
   In general, light colors, textures and small overall prints are
unobtrusive, while large, splashy prints, shiny and metallic papers
dramatize space. To minimize bad walls, choose a low-gloss,
textured covering or a large overall print as long as it isn't
shiny.
   Small and dark rooms will seem more spacious if you choose pale
colors and small patterns.
   Lower a ceiling by covering it in a bright color or strong
pattern. Limit the use of a bold print by papering a foyer or hall
or small bath, since large, busy expanses of any pattern can become
tiresome.
   When it's time to apply the wallcovering, cover the pasting
table with plain brown wrapping paper or inexpensive tablecloths or
dropcloths. Don't use newspapers because the ink may come through
to the new covering.
   If you're working on top of old wallpaper, it's best to strip it
from the wall. Strippable or vinyl wallpaper peel off easily when
you grasp a corner and pull. Wash the walls with warm water and
scrape off the remaining glue with a putty knife after you've done
the stripping. If the wallpaper to be covered is in good, tight
condition, you can paper over it.
   At worst, rent a wallpaper steamer or apply wallpaper remover.
They soften the paper so you can scrape it off with a wide putty
knife. After scraping, wash the walls and allow them to dry before
hanging the new wallcovering.
   For a better-looking job, work slowly and don't try to finish
the projct in one day. Wallcovering paste dries slowly enough so
that you can adjust a strip and eliminate seam mismatches and
bubbles, if necessary.
   Save extra wallpaper, which can be used to fix small tears and
loose edges without repapering. For loose seams, apply the paste to
both the wall and the wallpaper, press the paper in place, smooth
it with a seam roller and then wipe away the extra paste.
   To patch a small damaged area, paste a new piece of wallcovering
larger than the tear over the damaged areas, matching the patterns
exactly. Allow the patch to set, but not to dry entirely. Then, cut
through both areas, clean the empty area and repaste the top piece.
Wait 15 minutes and roll the edges smooth.
   Other ways to use wallpaper:
   _ If there is a pattern, cut out some of the motifs and apply
them to lampshades and accessories.
   _ Wallpaper a closet.
   _ Create custom waste receptacles, perhaps from large round ice
cream cartons or plastic or metal wastepaper cans.
   _ Use wallpaper inserts on kitchen cabinets, bathroom counter
tops.
   _ Use for picture frames.
   _ Wallpaper borders can update and enliven old furniture. Just
glue them on.

   The difference between a room that looks right and one that
looks all wrong may be a matter of scale.
   When Marilyn Glass, decorating editor of Ladies Home Journal,
surveyed eight common decorating mistakes, she found seven involved
errors of scale, mainly combining furnishings in mismatched sizes.
   Scale, according to Glass, refers to the size of objects and
their relationship to each other and the space around them.
   A room works better, she says, if the objects are on the same
general level. For examples of good scale, check out model rooms in
stores and in decorating magazines and books, noting the relative
sizes of major pieces of furniture and accessories.
   Some typical errors of judgment include selecting armchairs that
are too shallow and too high-backed for the sofa in the room;
choosing end tables that are too narrow and too high for the
seating; placing a coffee table that is too small in front of a
sofa; using lamps that tower over the furniture and accessories.
   By keeping a set of general decorating guidelines on hand when
you go shopping, you may be able to eliminate all or most of these
errors.
   A sofa should measure a little less than half the length of the
wall it is placed against. (If the room is large enough, try
placing a love seat on one side of the sofa and an upholstered
chair on the other.)
   For toss cushions to go with the upholstery, choose a 20- or
24-inch square for a standard-depth upholstered piece.
   Tables next to the sofa should be about a quarter to one-third
the length of the sofa and their height no more than 4 inches
taller than the top of the arms of the sofa.
   Instead of choosing two matched end tables, select different
styles; for example, an antique chest or a skirted table for one
and a standard rectangular table for the other.
   A coffee table should be about half the length of the sofa and
at a comfortable height in relation to the sofa seat. An
alternative to the single large coffee table is two matching
smaller ones with a little space between them.
   An area rug should be large enough to generously border the
coffee table.
   A painting above the sofa should be about the size of the coffee
table top.
   To camouflage empty corners in a room, use an interesting
panelled folding screen, one or more large plants or a large piece
of furniture.

   A growing interest in traditional interiors has helped pave the
way for the return of the grandfather clock to a place of honor in
many American homes.
   Originally known as a tall or a long case clock (it is still so
called in the antique circuit), it became a ``grandfather clock''
because of the popularity of the song, ``My Grandfather's Clock,''
around 1875.
   According to John Snellenburg, a vice president at Christie's
and a specialist in clocks and watches, interest in buying
grandfather clocks is high, though the clocks don't get much
publicity. Sales figures indicate such clocks are highly desirable
home accessories, he says.
   Those seeking a grandfather clock for the home have to compete
with serious collectors of fine American furniture as well as clock
fanciers who are interested in the development of horology.
   Snellenburg says there are plenty of grandfather clocks to go
around, however.
   The most important consideration in selecting an antique clock
is the condition of both the case and the works. Clocks are usually
survivors, he says, and unless one has been especially abused, it
probably can be put in good working order.
   A good quality English long case clock dating from the 18th
century or early 19th century costs from $1,000 to $3,500 at an
auction. The clock is likely to feature a painted white dial, often
with an arch, and a case of mahogany or oak. The same clock might
cost $3,000 to $5,000 in an antiques store, says Snellenburg.
   American clocks from the same era tend to be more expensive,
especially if signed by a famous maker. It would not be uncommon to
find prices of $40,000 to $100,000 for a signed Willard family
clock, he says. American country clocks might range from $4,000 to
$10,000.
   Snellenburg recommends considering grandfather clocks that are
neither antique nor new.
   ``Some of the 80-year-old clocks are a very good buy now,'' he
says. ``They have good movements and are usually copies of the
traditional English style.''
   When buying an old clock, choose a reputable dealer. If buying
from a dealer who doesn't normally deal in clocks, ask a specialist
to look at it before you buy.
   Old clocks most likely have appreciated in value as they age and
are likely to continue to appreciate if they are in good condition.
   But there are advantages to buying a new grandfather clock.
Today's clocks offer more features, as well as sizes appropriate
for today's interiors. They are dependable as timekeepers and offer
such features as triple chimes, ornate pendulums and a beveled
glass section to reveal the interior workings.
   Prices for new grandfather clocks range from $600 to $7,000,
depending on complexity of design, size and expense of materials _
rare burls, carvings, beveled glass, gold-plated dials. Bigger
movements cost more.
   Most contemporary grandfather clocks play as many as three
different melodies or chimes, says Philip Miller, executive vice
president of Howard Miller Clock Co. Few of the old clocks are
truly musical; they tell the time and strike the hour.
   Contemporary clocks chime the whole tune on the hour and partial
tune on the quarter, half and three-quarter hour. The melodies are
based on church chimes. For example, the Westminster chimes are
taken from a portion of the ``Messiah,'' by Handel, as rendered at
London's Big Ben; the Whittinton chimes are from London's St. Mary
Le Bow.
   In clocks that play three melodies, the chimes are like a music
box, with a selection lever. You can set the tune you want to hear.

   There are almost as many prescriptions for choosing attractive
color combinations as there are colors.
   Some suggest selecting color schemes by looking in your clothes
closet and picking colors you enjoy wearing. One advises a trip to
the supermarket to buy fruits and vegetables and taking them home
to ``play'' with until you decide on a combination you like.
Another idea is to use a favorite painting to identify colors you
enjoy living with.
   Whatever method you choose, finding the colors you like is only
the first hurdle. There are problems that come up no matter what
colors you decide on, says John Pile, author of ``Interior Design.''
   Pile says many people select too many colors for one room; their
``rainbow coalition'' becomes too chaotic and random. Or they
choose an intense color _ like fire engine red _ for large areas.
Others, he says, eschew bright colors altogether and choose safe
neutrals, resulting in dull, uninviting rooms.
   The answer, says Pile, is to learn which color schemes work and
then adapt them to your own environment and color preferences.
   Color harmony is a key to color schemes. The easiest color
schemes to duplicate are harmonious schemes that includes
monochromatic and analogous combinations.
   Monochromatic schemes use a single color in a variety of hues;
neutrals like white, beige and gray predominate. An example would
be a room in which various shades of blue or red were combined. Any
possible monotony could be relieved by colorful artwork,
accessories or even the costumes of the occupants, Pile says.
   Analogous color schemes use hues closer together on the color
wheel. Examples are blue with blue-green, or blue-violet or green
with blue-green and yellow-green.
   Complementary schemes use hues from opposite ends of the color
wheel: red with green, orange with blue, yellow with violet. But
safeguard against over-brightness by choosing a quiet hue for one
of the color and covering large areas with it.
   Texture, pattern and shine affect the appearance of colors, as
does the placement of one color in relation to the others. Light
colors appear lighter when seen against a darker background; dark
colors become darker against a light background. A medium tone can
be made to seem either light or dark by its contrast with its
surroundings.
   Warm colors advance and appear closer; cool colors appear to
recede. Placing sharply contrasting colors together can cause a
sense of vibration. These optical illusions can be used to make
small spaces seem larger and to render oddly shaped rooms less
noticeable.
   A long, narrow room, for example, will seem shaped more normally
if end walls are painted a strong, warm color, while side walls are
painted a light, cool color.
   A dark ceiling will seem lower than the same ceiling in a light
tone.
   Painting a door and wall the same color will cause it to blend
into the room. Painting them different colors will make them stand
out.
   Knowing how colors appear and react with other colors can help
you choose a color scheme that not only appeals to your senses but
also minimizes flaws and creates an atmosphere that can be calm,
restful, stimulating, exciting or dignified.
   In general, it is suggested you select the dominant colors
first. These are the hues that will occupy the largest spaces,
whether floors, walls or ceilings. Then consider the secondary
areas, such as furniture, window treatments and accessories. Add
small streams of color in strong values as accents in the form of
throw cushions and artwork.

   There's an unusually wide choice these days with upholstered
furniture, as the fashionable style variations range from the
formality of 19th-century parlors through the simplicity of country
kitchen or porch to the ageless look of fine leather.
   A fashionable interest in novelty conjures an image of an
adventurous hostess entertaining in a room made to look like the
inside of an Indian wigwam, a Parisian sewer or a 1950s American
diner.
   The 19th-century style appears to be the way to go. Ellen
Frankel, editor of 1,001 Home Ideas magazine, says that at the
recent furniture market in North Carolina, there was a return to
dressmaker details reminiscent of the Victorian era, with contrast
welting, bows, beautifully detailed skirts, a slipcover look on
furniture that is actually upholstered, and pleats and double
ruffles.
   Robert Herring, vice president of Schumacher, a fabric supplier
to high end furniture companies, also endorsed the 19th century as
a treasure trove of ideas for today. His company is preparing a
``Natchez'' collection dominated by high-style Victorian _
watermark silks, damasks, brocades, moires and velvets with
embossed effects.
   According to Sterling Collett, vice president at Drexel
Furniture Co., more formality in fabrics is the watchword. Besides
the damasks and brocades of traditional luxury, needlepoint and
tapestry fabrics are growing popular _ at the expense of casual
stripes, plaids and textured fabrics that have been a mainstay over
the past several years.
   Among the most popular fabrications in the Drexel showroom this
spring were upholstered pieces covered in medium green moire velvet
and ruby red figured damask. Extensive multicolored fringe and
braid trim were applied to the pieces.
   For the future, Schumacher is betting on the ethnic look. ``By
and large,'' said Herring, ``American consumers have become more
sophisticated and are often influenced by museum exhibitions such
as the Gauguin exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution.''
   Schumacher's ethnic collection will be based on Peruvian and
Inca documents in the American Museum of Natural History. Its
introduction this fall will coincide with the opening of a new
museum wing devoted to those cultures.
   According to Frankel, leather remains very popular. She advises
care, however, in choosing leather furniture. Try to make sure the
leather will keep its good looks over the year and not crack, she
says.
   What's out? Mauve apparently is being recolored to look like
rose in many fabric lines. And there is an increase in green at the
expense of blue.
   Should you care what's in and what's not? Not necessarily. But
if you are redecorating over several years, it will be easier to
find coordinating accessories if you choose something that is
beginning its time rather than at its end.

   Furniture bargains are out there, somewhere, says a prominent
furniture restorer _ ``They're just hiding where you'd least expect
to find them.''
   One way to find them, says Homer Formby, is to run an ad in the
local newspaper announcing, ``I Buy Used Furniture.'' It's better
to say ``used'' furniture rather than ``antique,'' he says, to keep
prices reasonable. Then make appointments with callers and go out
on weekend ``treasure hunts.''
   ``You'd be surprised at the number of people who have $20,000
worth of old furniture stuck in a dusty attic or musty basement,''
says Formby.
   Other places to look: ``Flea markets, junk shops and auctions .
.. real estate sales and garage sales. Often, people have lived
with this furniture all their lives, and they're eager to get rid
of it.
   ``Take your time looking, and be thorough. Look in all the nooks
and crannies _ even behind doors.''
   Formby says furniture doesn't have to be 100 years old to be
worth restoring.
   ``I've come across a lot of 50- and 60-year-old reproductions
worth as much, or more, than some 100-year-old antiques,'' he says.
``So think twice before passing over any piece that's made of solid
wood.''

   You can save money and still have custom touches when remodeling
your kitchen, says Jim Krengel, a kitchen designer.
   Some tips from Krengel, who is design director of the Maytag
Kitchen Ideas Center:
   _ Instead of buying a ready-made floor-to-ceiling pantry,
combine two ready-made base cabinets by stacking one on top of the
other. Use the base cabinet with drawers right side up on the
bottom, then top it with a two-door base cabinet turned upside down
with its toe kick space removed.
   Base cabinets are deeped than top cabinets, so you can get more
canned goods and staples into the door cabinet than you could with
an above-counter cabinet.
   If there's still room, use the cabinet top to hold an
attractive, but seldom used serving dish or salad bowl. If the
cabinet top is close to the ceiling, install molding to hide the
edges and give a built-in look.
   _ Attach wall cabinets to the sides or back of a work island or
dining island in the kitchen. The cabinets can provide foot-deep
storage and if you use 42-inch high units behind a 35-inch high
island, the work area is hidden from view.
   _ For a decorative way of storing staples, buy a 15-by-30-inch
or 18-by-30-inch glass door cabinet and turn it on its side. The
glass door will then open out and down and can be fitted with
tilt-out bins for staples such as beans, peas, rice, macaroni,
snacks _ even dog biscuits.
   _ For more storage space for narrow items, re-cover the wasted
space between the wall studs. The space, about 3{ inches deep, is
behind the sheetrock walls. It can be exposed and then painted or
lined with patterned adhesive-backed plastic to house spices,
canned goods, glasses and other skinny items.
   _ If you don't want to eliminate a window, but it is keeping you
from installing a needed storage cabinet, consider installing a
cabinet with glass sides in front of the window. Then place items
like glasses in the cabinet so that the light and view are diffused
but not altogether removed.
   _ If a window is too low and you want to put a counter in front
of it, cut out the counter in front of the window so that a narrow
well is created. You can use the well to hold plants, or herbs and
spices.

   An attractive table setting, it is said, enhances a meal.
   Before selecting your tableware, you should decide on the point
of view you want to take and choose a pattern that reflects your
individual style.
   ``Dinnerware will be the foundation of your well-dressed
table,'' says Alice Kolator, director of public relations for Lenox
China and Crystal. ``Keep a close eye on pattern and color. When
mixing and matching patterns, follow the basic rule that background
colors should always match.''
   ``Flatware,'' she says, ``can repeat and enhance a motif
established by a dinnerware pattern. Or it can make a statement all
its own. It offers great flexibility when mixing and matching
patterns.''
   As for crystal, the ``crowning jewel of your table,'' Ms.
Kolator advises: ``A more heavily cut crystal is best when joined
with simple dinnerware. Delicately cut crystal is more versatile
and can be used with a wide variety of dinnerware patterns.''
   ``The younger generation is fascinated with food and it's
spreading to their dinnerware,'' says Peter Jungkunst, executive
vice president of Jungkunst China. ``People are investigating the
consumer benefits as well as the aesthetics of china.''
   Jungkunst says eating from china encourages food variety in a
meal. ``People are more likely to include all four of the food
groups when serving a meal on china,'' he says, ``while eating on
paper plates encourages one to eat an imbalanced meal.''

   What's the difference between an Oriental rug and a kilim?
   According to the owners of Rug Tower, a New York retail rug
outlet, Oriental rugs are hand-knotted and have pile; kilim is a
generic term for flat-weave pieces that are hand-woven on looms.
(Dhurries are kilims made, for the most part, in India.)
   The leading countries making Oriental rugs, they say, are Iran,
China, India, Pakistan and Turkey.

   Toothpaste and credit cards are among the ``tools'' a furniture
restorer says can use to clean up water spots, cigarette burns or
gashes on wood finishes.
   Toothpaste, says Homer Formby, is a gentle abrasive and can be
used to remove water spots and rings on wood furniture. Just
squeeze toothpaste on to a wet cotton rag and buff the spotted
area, he says. For stubborn rings, combine the toothpaste with
equal parts of baking soda.
   For cigarette burns, dip a cotton swab into nail polish remover
and rub it lightly across the burned area. If any discoloration
remains, scrape it gently with a pen knife. If a slight hollow is
left, mix equal parts nail polish remover with clear nail polish
and apply the mixture with the nail polish brush. Allow each coat
to dry for several minutes until the hollow is filled; it may take
seven or eight coats.
   For scratches, melt a crayon the color of your wood finish and
let the colored wax drip into the gash until it overflows, says
Formby. Let the melted crayon dry 30 minutes and use a credit card
to gently shave off the residue.

   More than 11 million women are currently working from home,
either full time or part time, according to a 1987 survey by Link
Resources, a New York-based consulting firm.
   As a result, finding room for a work-at-home office has become a
common remodeling goal.
   To ensure that work at home is satisfying rather than
frustrating, it is important to set up a special place dedicated to
the work, says Kathleen Christensen, author of ``Women and
Home-Based Work: The Unspoken Contract.''
   If there's no space for a separate office, use part of another
room _ but redo the space so it functions as a real work space.
Interior designer Elaine Ryan suggests using a corner of a room
that is large enough for a small desk and two chairs.
   Create visual separation by removing personal items such as
knickknacks and family photographs. Instead, hang your diplomas,
certificates and other documents on the wall near the desk.
   Paint or wallpaper the office area in a slightly different shade
from the rest of the room. For example, if your walls are white,
cover the office wall with a striped wallpaper with an off-white
background.
   Conceal the space for privacy, or when not in use, by enclosing
it with one or two three-paneled screens in a neutral color.
   If your work does not require client visits, consider converting
a closet into an office work space. Remove the door and use the
closet space for shelving, file cabinets and other supplies.
   Few closets are roomy enough to accommodate a desk as well, but
you can place a desk next to the closet at right angles to it.
Cabinets or shelving used to create an L-shape or small separate
work area can also serve the same purpose, while adding work
storage space at the same time.
   Home office designers say that storage and other needs vary,
depending on the tools you will use. In general, plan for a
telephone and a typewriter or personal computer and printer. All
need electrical outlets.
   The most comfortable height for typing at a typewriter or
computer keyboard is 3 to 4 inches lower than standard desk height.
If it is impossible to provide a surface for that, use a desk chair
with an adjustable height.
   If you're working with computers, you're likely to find that
computer desks and storage components (either custom-made or
ready-made) work best. If you plan to place computer equipment on a
desk, be sure to measure first and take into account the depth
needed for installation. Don't forget to allow for the bulky wires
and plugs at the back of the components.
   When planning the location of the printer, allow space for
continuous feed paper.
   Good lighting is essential for any task, including desk work.
Choices of light sources vary from floor and table lamps to
adjustable desk lamps with goosenecks and spotlights. But most
important is to have the light fall on the work, not on the worker.
Avoid glare by proper placement of the light.
   For a desk chair, choose seating that is adjustable in several
ways, especially if more than one person will be using the desk.
Look for a chair that has an adjustable seat and back height, a
tilting back and a contoured seat and casters for added mobility.

   The unemployment rate last month rose one-tenth of a percentage
point from the 14-year low of 5.3 percent in June. A total of
170,000 more Americans _ 80 percent of them teen-agers _ found

   The dollar was higher in late-morning European
trading today, though dealers said its rise had been temporarily
halted by West German central bank intervention.
   The Bundesbank started selling dollars for West German marks
early in the session to stem the U.S. currency's rise and dealers
said the market was not fazed initially. But by late morning, the
intervention had at least temporarily halted the dollar's advance.
   ``It has put the dollar under control,'' said one trader in
Milan.
   The dollar was boosted late Friday by good U.S. employment data
for July, which fueled market speculation that the U.S. Federal
Reserve will raise interest rates soon. Higher interest rates make
the dollar a more attractive investment.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.85 Japanese yen to a closing 133.97.
Later, in London, it was quoted slightly lower at 133.93 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.9004 West German marks, up from 1.8890; 1.5887
Swiss francs, up from 1.5757; 6.4085 French francs, up from 6.3675;
2.14575 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1315; 1,400.75 Italian lire, up
from 1,393.00; 1.2078 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2050.
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.6915 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.6977 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $431.60 a troy ounce and
at mid-morning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $431.85. Both prices were down from Friday's
late bid of $432.10.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $431.90, down from $433.00 late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid $434.00, up a penny
from Saturday's $433.99.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.80 a troy
ounce, down from Friday's $6.89.

<HEAD>To Maintain Growth, Condom Companies Targeting Women Buyers</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New for PMs.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LITTLE FALLS, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The condom market is leveling off
after heavy growth spurred by fear of AIDS, and the nation's two
biggest manufacturers hope to maintain consumer interest by
targeting female buyers, according to industry officials.
   Carter-Wallace Inc. of New York and Schmid Laboratories of
Little Falls plan soon to release products in feminine-style
packaging that they hope will encourage more women to buy the
prophylactics.
   Women account for an estimated 40 percent of condom purchases,
industry experts say. Schmid Laboratories, the nation's
second-biggest condom seller with 35 percent of the market, wants
to shore up declining sales by appealing to them.
   Last month, the company laid off 150 temporary workers at its
Anderson, S.C., manufacturing plant because of a drop in demand.
   One reason for the slower sales was the higher prices condom
manufacturers recently began paying for Malaysian latex used to
make most of the products. Officials also say new regulations by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have trimmed profit margins
by mandating a tenfold increase in condom testing.
   Schmid president Don Falk said sales remain strong, but are not
near the lofty numbers that followed Surgeon General C. Everett
Koop's advice last year to use condoms to avoid transmitting
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   ``People realized the initial impact was not going to continue
forever,'' Falk said of the sales surge. ``But we are at a higher
production level now than pre-AIDS.''
   Diana Temple, a Salomon Brothers Inc. analyst who follows
Carter-Wallace, says women can be important to the market if more
begin relying on condoms for contraception, as recent studies show
they are.
   ``I think (sales) are moderating,'' Ms. Temple said. ``People
appear to be buying them. The key is if they are using them.''
   Condom company officials would not estimate the dollar amount of
their sales but said the industry estimates it will sell about $404
million worth of condoms in the United States this year, which Ms.
Temple said would represent a 20 percent rise in sales.
   To maintain consumer interest, Carter-Wallace, which controls
half of the market, soon will be marketing Trojans for Women,
spokeswoman Liz Stecher said.
   Schmid soon will introduce Ramses for Her and She's Sheik
condoms, variations on two of the company's top-selling lines.
Among the added feminine touches in the new products are a carrying
case for each condom and disposable envelopes.
   ``The emphasis now is on educating young people to use condoms
if they are sexually active and non-monogomous. We think young
women are more likely to respond to this than young men,'' Falk
said.

<HEAD>Dollar Rebounds In Tokyo, Stocks Continue Slide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar regained lost ground against the
Japanese yen today in Tokyo, while stock prices accumulated further
losses.
   The dollar closed the day at 133.97 yen, up a strong 0.85 yen
from its close Friday at 133.12 yen. It traded briefly today at a
high of 134.05 yen.
   ``The dollar moved up mainly because of the activity around the
West German mark,'' said a dealer at a major Japanese securities
firm, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The dollar rose to a 19-month high against the deutsche mark in
New York on Friday, propped up in part by strong earnings and
payroll figures in the July U.S. employment report released last
week.
   According to the U.S. Labor Department, the nation's jobless
rate rose to 5.4 percent in July from a 14-year low of 5.3 percent
in June.
   In a separate report, the department said the number of non-farm
payrolls in June was revised upward, showing much stronger job
creation than preliminary figures indicated.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, meanwhile, the Nikkei average of
225 selected issues, a 60.20-point loser during Saturday's half-day
session, slid a further 109.60 points, or 0.38 percent, to close
the day at 28,253.12 points.
   Dealers said the market was plagued by interest rate concerns
continuing from the U.S. employment report.
   Volume on the first section of the exchange was estimated at 600
million shares, down from 800 million shares Friday, the most
recent full day of trade.

<HEAD>Farm Sales to Asia Expected to Rise $2 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. farm sales to East Asia are expected to
rise by $2 billion this fiscal year, according to the latest
forecast from the Department of Agriculture.
   The increase, which should bring agricultural sales to East Asia
to $10 billion or $11 billion a year, will come during an overall
expansion of farm exports to the Pacific Rim, USDA says.
   It says farm exports to Canada also are likely to increase and
cites the lower dollar as one major reason.
   Pacific Rim sales probably will account for nearly one-third of
total U.S. agricultural exports this fiscal year, according to a
department report.
   Farm production declined in most of the Pacific Rim last year,
the report said.
   In East Asia, it said, rice consumption is down, in part because
of urban growth and a stronger economy. But at the same time, wheat
consumption is on the upswing, both because of changed eating
habits and increased use of wheat as feed for livestock.
   Similarly, East Asia's coarse grain consumption is expected to
increase 6 percent because of large livestock inventories, strong
industrial use and eased South Korean quotas.
   Drought plaguing the Farm Belt remains an uncertainty, the
report said. It said the heat and lack of grain should reduce
soybean production, but it also said long-term prospects for
soybean exports to East Asia appear promising.
   Fast-food restaurants and higher incomes are expected to
increase East Asian consumption of meat over the long term but
higher livestock feed costs and lower meat product prices mean
growth of production should be slow this year, the report said.
   It said the key to U.S. access to the market depends on East
Asian access to the American textile and clothing markets.
   Easing of Japanese restrictions on beef imports also is expected
to spur consumer demand, according to the analysis.

   The Agriculture Department is continuing to
open emergency programs to additional farmers as drought spreads.
   Maryland and West Virginia are the latest states declared
eligible for Farmers Home Administration emergency loans because of
drought-related crop losses.
   The order from Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng applied to
all 23 counties in Maryland and all 55 counties in West Virginia.
   To be eligible farmers must have crop insurance if available to
offset crop losses, USDA said.
   They also must be able to repay the loan and any other loans
they have outstanding and be unable to obtain credit elsewhere, the
statement said. It said adequate security would be required.
   Designation of Maryland and West Virginia brought the number of
entire states eligible to eight. The others are Alabama, Indiana,
Missouri, Ohio, Wisconsin and Delaware.
   ``This disaster designation only makes FmHA emergency loans
available in the affected counties and does not ensure family
farmers eligibility for such loans,'' Lyng said in letters to
governors of the states.
   Thus far, USDA has approved hay cutting and grazing on Acreage
Conservation Reserve and Conservation Use Acreage as well as hay
cutting on sound-alike but separate Conservation Reserve Program
land in 2,184 counties in 42 states, the department said Friday.
   It said hay cutting on Water Bank Program lands has been
approved in 191 counties in 11 states. Livestock feed aid programs
have been approved for 1,600 counties in 37 states, the department
said.
   It said a program under which farmers get 92 percent of their
payments while producing no crop have been authorized for 107
counties in 21 states.

   Secretary of Agriculture Richard E. Lyng has
named William C. Bailey deputy undersecretary of agriculture for
international affairs and community programs.
   Deputy Undersecretary Richard W. Goldberg remains acting
undersecretary, Lyng said in a statement released by the
department. It said the Bailey appointment becomes effective today.
   Bailey will share responsibility for the department's
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, which has
operations in 2,000 counties across the country, the department
said.
   It said he also will have responsibility for an array of
overseas programs.
   Bailey, a native of Jacksonville, Ill., has been deputy
administrator for program planning and development in the
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service since 1985. He
was the economist for the Senate Agriculture committee from 1979 to
1982 and manager of commodity analysis with General Mills from 1982
to 1985.

<HEAD>RFD-TV Hopes For Good Harvest of Viewers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM NOLAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rock 'n' rollers have MTV, sports fans have
ESPN and investors have the Financial News Network. Now, there's
RFD-TV for farmers _ an idea its developers hope will reap a
bountiful harvest of profits.
   ``We're a whole new concept and we're delivering stories that no
one else is delivering,'' said Patrick Gottsch, chairman and chief
executive officer of the satellite network scheduled to go on the
air Aug. 15.
   ``It seems like there's always something going on with
agriculture,'' he said. ``But one problem is farmers are not
getting accurate or timely information on a daily basis or even an
hourly basis.''
   RFD-TV hopes to change that with 24-hour, seven-day a week
programming available to households with a satellite dish, Gottsch
said in a recent interview, as workers scrambled to build sets and
uncrate equipment in time for the network premiere.
   He said plans call for RFD-TV, named after the U.S. Postal
Service's old acronym for rural free delivery, to grow like the
crops that will be its subject matter, expanding to cable and
low-power television systems.
   Gottsch, who was raised on a farm near Elkhorn and later worked
as a commodity broker and satellite dish dealer, said he came up
with the idea for RFD-TV about three years ago.
   There are 2.8 million home satellite dishes in the United States
and 250,000 in Canada. About 60 percent are in rural areas, Gottsch
said.
   ``It's just a common sense project,'' he said. ``If you take a
drive in the country you see a lot of dishes and they're going to
be watching us.''
   The programming won't be reruns of ``Hee-Haw,'' ``The Real
McCoys'' or ``Mayberry R.F.D.,'' Gottsch said.
   He described the network as a cross between the Financial News
Network, ESPN and the Cable News Network, but geared toward rural
America.
   Universities in all 50 states will produce shows for RFD-TV and
a live prime-time interview show in which viewers may phone in
questions is planned.
   RFD-TV also will have its own barnyard take-off on home shopping
_ video livestock auctions to give farmers a chance to expand their
herds without leaving their living rooms, Gottsch said.
   ``We're very confident people are going to like what they see on
our air _ we're not doing things half-cocked,'' Gottsch said.
``They're going to see a very shiny farm network that they're going
to want to watch.''
   The fledgling Omaha-based network has a 21-member news staff,
with bureaus in Chicago, Washington, Kansas City, Mo., and Fresno,
Calif., Gottsch said.
   The staff will produce seven hours of live news, weather and
markets coverage every week day, and several half-hour summaries
daily.
   ``Currently, agricultural programming is scattered throughout
the television system,'' Gottsch said. ``There is hit-and-miss
coverage on local stations and some largely irrelevant feature
material on the major networks.''
   Advertisers and home satellite dish dealers are excited about
the network.
   ``There is a definite `What do we have to lose?' attitude among
major advertisers,'' Gottsch said. ``Because of satellite
communications, our ad rates are lower than a local TV station.''
   Agricultural advertisers also have been supportive because
``there's a need for a rifle shot approach to the farmer instead of
the shotgun approach,'' he said.
   Because RFD-TV is a free, unscrambled service, the network could
spur lagging satellite dish sales, Gottsch said.
   ``We're the first free and clear channel on satellite in the
last two years. We're good news for the home satellite dealer. We
are definitely a reason for someone to buy home dish,'' he said.
   Despite high start-up costs of more than $3 million, Gottsch
predicted the channel will turn a profit in its first year.
   ``We have built-in shows with built-in audiences with built-in
advertisers,'' said Gottsch, who is among the network's investors.
   ``We only have to sell 13 percent of our available ad time to
turn a profit.''

<HEAD>It's Not `Junk Mail' to Everyone</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   It may be ``junk mail'' to some people, but
more than one American in four would like to receive more
advertising mail, according to a survey done by the Postal Service.
   Thirty-one percent of the people surveyed said they found the
information in mailed advertising useful, and 27 percent said they
would like to receive more, reports John R. Wargo, assistant
postmaster general for marketing.
   In contrast, 15 percent said they wish they received less
advertising in the mail.
   Third-class has been the fastest-growing category of mail in
recent years, raising the U.S. Postal Service to the status of the
nation's third largest advertising medium, trailing only newspapers
and television, said Wargo.
   ``The reason that we're in business is because of the receivers,
and we need to find out what they want and we need to tell the
senders,'' Wargo said of the survey covering 5,300 homes across the
nation.
   The study, done last year, was disclosed to business mailers at
a meeting in Los Angeles and later discussed by Wargo in an
interview.
   He said the study found that the Postal Service handles 17
percent of advertising, compared to 27 percent for newspapers and
22 percent for television.
   ``We believe that we've got a better opportunity to grow if our
receivers are satisfied, they react favorably, and they read it.
What were trying to do is help the sender improve their ability to
get a favorable reaction and more business. And that's going to
keep us in business. It's a straight business proposition.''
   Third-class advertising mail increased 173 percent between 1972
and 1987, while other categories increased by only 44 percent.
   For the average household, third class mail went from three
items a week in 1972 to 8.7 last year. Over the same period the
volume of first-class mail per household went up from 7.4 to 8.6
items a week, while newspapers and magazines dropped from 2.3 to
1.6, according to Wargo's study.
   But while Americans are getting more advertising mail, do they
read it?
   As volume increased, readership has declined, Wargo found.
   Last year 51 percent of third-class mail was read, according to
the study, down from 83 percent in 1972.
   The higher the household income, the more advertising mail
received, but the less that was read, the study found. And yet the
higher income households were more likely to order something, and
ordered more often via mail.
   The most important factor in getting someone to open the ad,
read it and perhaps buy something, Wargo found, was familiarity
with the advertiser.
   ``The highest open-and-read rate is a result of the person
knowing who the company is and having done business with them,''
said Wargo.
   The increase in mail advertising places conflicting demands on
the Postal Service, he said, including a need to see that those
receiving the mail are not offended or bothered by it.
   ``I think there are going to be some senders who say, `Your job
is only to take what we give you.' I don't think we're going to
accept that. On the other hand the receivers are going to say, `You
should screen everything' and I don't think were going to do
that,'' Wargo said.
   ``We're very, very concerned that if this audience does not
continue to have a high level of satisfaction we won't have
anything to sell to'' other advertisers, he said.

<HEAD>Filmmaking More Dangerous Now, Says Stunt Accident Attorney</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer seeking legislation to promote
safety on movie sets says filmmaking is more dangerous now than
when three people were killed on the set of ``Twilight Zone: The
Movie.''
   With pressure for bigger and more spectacular special effects in
movies, attorney Jerry Kroll says stuntmen and women are risking
injury and death daily.
   ``First they were jumping out of cars. Then it was jumping off
buildings, then out of airplanes. Next it will be the Concorde,''
said Kroll.
   ``I think Hollywood is more dangerous today than ever.''
   Kroll, who is handling six lawsuits resulting from movie and TV
set accidents, says the situation is unlikely to change without
legislation.
   ``The `Twilight Zone' focused public attention on safety,''
Kroll said of the 1987 trial that ended with the acquittal of
director John Landis and four co-defendants on involuntary
manslaughter charges.
   ``But the public got to watch John Landis being acquitted, and
the question is was that an acquittal of the industry? I say he was
on trial and not the industry.
   ``If we learned anything from `Twilight Zone,' it's that the
criminal justice system isn't going to make the industry safer,''
said Kroll. ``We have to do it some other way.''
   He is pushing for passage of a bill that would require licensing
of stunt coordinators and special effects coordinators and would
forbid moviemakers to use film footage of any stunt that resulted
in injury or death.
   One of Kroll's clients, stuntman Max Maxwell, was injured in a
special effects explosion during filming of a 1985 action movie.
   ``The film contains footage of my client getting blown up,''
said Kroll. ``It's just not right.''
   ``If filmmakers know they can't use that kind of footage,'' said
Kroll, ``they will have a financial motivation to make sure the
scene is safe when they shoot it.''

   Six years after Hollywood's deadliest movie
accident and a year after a celebrated trial, the ``Twilight Zone''
remains a nagging dilemma for the movie industry.
   Scrutiny of the helicopter crash that killed veteran actor Vic
Morrow and two child actors has resumed with the publication of a
book about the trial of the director, John Landis, and four
co-defendants. Another book on the subject is due next month.
   Participants still debate details of the crash that occurred
July 23, 1982, during filming of a Vietnam War scene for ``Twilight
Zone: The Movie.'' The helicopter crashed during special effects
explosions, also killing 6-year-old Renee Chen and Myca Dinh Le, 7.
   Attorney James Neal, who successfully defended Landis against
manslaughter charges in Los Angeles County Superior Court, says the
case should be ``over and done with.''
   ``The reason it won't go away,'' says attorney Harland Braun,
``is because the system never assessed moral responsibility and no
one accepted moral responsibility.
   ``Landis has never said, `I did the wrong thing,''' said Braun,
who represented associate producer George Folsey Jr. at the trial.
   Despite a jury's acquittal of Landis, Folsey and the
co-defendants of involuntary manslaughter, Braun and two other
defense attorneys _ Arnold Klein, representing special effects
coordinator Paul Stewart, and Eugene Trope, representing pilot
Dorcey Wingo _ believe an acknowledgment of responsibility was
called for.
   ``I don't think much of Landis,'' said Klein. ``He had a
cowardly defense where he blamed everyone else. He never came out
and said he was deeply sorry for that which he was responsible
for.''
   Author Ronald Labrecque, whose book ``Special Effects'' is due
next month, said Landis fuels controversy with his own actions. For
example:
   _In early summer, Landis gave a dinner party at a trendy Beverly
Hills restaurant on the first anniversary of his acquittal.
Attorney Leonard Levine, a guest, said it was a ``nice'' gesture by
Landis to thank those who stood by him.
   _In June, Landis invited the trial jurors to a private screening
of ``Coming to America,'' the Eddie Murphy film he directed. The
jurors accepted, and Landis' action drew more criticism.
   In their newly published book, ``Outrageous Conduct: Art, Ego
and the Twilight Zone Case,'' authors Stephen Farber and Marc Green
sharply criticize Landis, the prosecutor who lost the case and the
movie industry that failed to penalize Landis for the deaths.
   ``There are elements of Hollywood that are morally bankrupt,''
said Green. ``They believe only in the bottom line, and as long as
John Landis' name is above the title of a movie that is the highest
grossing non-sequel in history (``Coming to America''), John Landis
will be welcome in those quarters.''
   ``No one asks questions,'' said Farber.
   Landis refused to be comment on the matter. His Los Angeles
lawyer, Joel Behr, said the director was in Europe and would not
comment even if he were here.
   Neal said Landis acknowledged his role in the accident when he
testified at the trial and should be allowed to ``get on with his
life.''
   ``They did wrong, and certainly it can be argued they were
guilty of violating child labor laws. But it should be over and it
should be done with,'' he said.
   Neal, his associate, James Sanders, and Levine, who represented
production manager Dan Allingham in the manslaughter trial, have
cameo roles in ``Coming To America.''
   Another key player in the ``Twilight Zone'' drama continues to
make news.
   Lea Purwin D'Agostino, the deputy district attorney who spent 10
months prosecuting the case, ran for District Attorney against her
boss, Ira Reiner, in June. She lost and has been transferred to a
lesser job. She calls the reassignment retaliation.
   ``No one is letting me forget it,'' she said. ``Probably,
because it's Hollywood. But there's also the enormity of the
horror, the absolutely needless loss of life for a lousy movie.''
   But Chief Deputy District Attorney Gilbert Garcetti denied the
reassigment was vindictive. He said plans to move Mrs. D'Agostino
to the other job were made several months ago and were not related
to the ``Twilight Zone'' verdict.

   From his farm in the Berkshire Hills,
Frank Patterson wages war on small-town autocrats, wresting from
them the minutes of meetings that even he admits can make pretty
boring reading in his Bulletin.
   So boring, in fact, that Patterson recently cut back publication
of his newsletter from twice monthly to once a month. ``I got an
inkling that too much was too much,'' he said.
   But the tree farmer has vowed to keep publishing the recorded
gatherings of selectmen, assessors, school and health boards for
his 250 readers as long as the money holds out.
   ``We've been operating in the red and I guess we will always
be,'' he said.
   The not-for-profit newsletter celebrates its first anniversary
next month. It has grown to six editions, one for each of the six
towns that hand over their minutes, and contains as many minutes as
Patterson can get. They include such mundane revelations as this,
from the May 5 meeting of the Hancock board of selectmen:
   ``Mr. Bowman appeared before the board with 104 lbs. of rocks,
stating that they had been picked up on 1,000 ft. of road frontage
on his property.''
   And this, from the May 8 meeting of the Hancock health board:
   ``Ruth Bush came to request rent for the landfill. She says she
was not paid for 1987. We will check.''
   About 100 copies are sent free to libraries, post offices and
other town offices, but Patterson has managed to talk the rest of
the subscribers into donations ranging from $5 to $100. Without
such gifts, he said, the paper would not survive.
   He applies the same persuasive logic to advertisers. Recalling a
restaurant that recently pulled a $50 ad the size of a business
card, Patterson said: ``I couldn't convince them that this is a
civic thing. No one is going to come to their restaurant to eat
because of that ad. It costs $100 to eat there anyway.''
   Patterson said he founded the newsletter to keep busy in his
retirement. He is a former purchasing agent for an electric company
who now runs a Christmas tree farm with his wife, Eleanor, 72, who
heads the board of selectmen in their town.
   ``I'm 71 and at my age, if you don't take up something new, your
mind begins to fall into pieces,'' he said.
   The newsletter proudly lists among its supporters two
newspapers, a retired publisher and Pulitzer Prize-winning
historian James MacGregor Burns, who called Patterson ``a local
friend doing what I think are good things.''
   But some apparently disagree.
   Patterson said officials in a few towns balked at releasing
their minutes and complied only after the state attorney general's
office told them they were obligated to make the minutes public.
   In at least one case, Patterson said, his request prompted town
officials to take minutes of their meetings for the first time.
   He said he is still trying to get minutes from New Ashford and
Richmond but is loathe to ask the state for help again.
   ``I'm afraid to stir them up,'' he said of the town officials.
``Then they'll never give them to me.''
   The head of the board of selectmen in New Ashford, one of the
state's smallest towns, with a population of 150 people, said he
has refused to mail the minutes to Patterson's home because of the
expense.
   ``The records are there. All he's got to do is come and get
them,'' said head selectman John H. Haig.
   Marguerite Rawson, head of the Richmond board, said she hasn't
sent minutes to Patterson because she has no time to edit them for
publication by the time they are typed up, usually several weeks
after the meeting.
   ``If he wants, he can sit down at our meetings and take notes,''
she said. ``But I don't have time to play around with his
newsletter. ... It's a sticky situation. I'm not trying to keep
anything from him, but I'm a busy woman. I work days and do this
(board business) at night.''
   Patterson said he's lost $2,500 so far on the newsletter, but he
plans to get it up to 20 editions before calling it quits.
   ``If I can do it here, by George, I can do it anywhere,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Murdoch Company Increases Control of New Zealand Newspapers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A company partly owned by Rupert
Murdoch announced today that it had increased its control of New
Zealand newspapers with the acquisition of four new titles.
   Independent Newspapers Ltd., which is 40 percent owned by
Murdoch's news corporation, said it paid $6 million in New Zealand
currency (about $5 million in U.S. currency) to Brierley
Investments Ltd. for the Daily Taranaki Herald and the Daily News,
in addition to two weeklies, the Sunday Express and the Northern
Star.
   The dailies have a combined circulation of about 35,000,
according to the New Zealand Audit Bureau of Circulations.
   Last month, Independent Newspapers bought newspaper interests of
N.Z. News, a subsidiary of Brierley Investments, in Auckland for
$72 million. Brierley is an investment company operated by Sir
Ronald Brierley, a New Zealand businessman.
   The latest transaction requires government approval.
   Michael Forbes, managing director of N.Z. News, said today that
there were no plans to sell the company's remaining major
newspapers _ the Star in Christchurch, the Oamaru Mail, the
Dannevirke Evening News and two small dailies in the Hawkes Bay
area. The company also retains the Woman's Weekly and a number of
business magazines.
   Independent Newspapers is the country's biggest newspaper chain,
according to chairman Alan Burnet.
   It already owns two dailies in Wellington, the Dominion and the
Evening Post, the Press in Christchurch, the Waikato Times in
Hamilton, the Manawatu Evening Standard in Palmerston North, the
Timaru Herald in Timaru and the Southland Times in Invercargill.

<TEXT>
   Though murder is not one of New York's selling
points, people are paying for the privilege of reliving some of the
city's macabre moments.
   A tour company with the innocuous name of Sidewalks of New York
is offering walking tours of murder sites to curiosity seekers who
want to know where some of the city's better-known victims took
their last breath, according to a report in today's editions of the
New York Post.
   ``I love a good murder,'' publicity agent Marnie Goodman said
while on her tour last Saturday.
   The sites in the $10 two-hour tour include the Omni Park Hotel
on 56th Street and Seventh Avenue, formerly the Park Sheraton,
where organized crime figure Albert Anastasia was riddled with
bullets while getting a shave in a barber shop in 1957. Also
featured are the tree in Central Park under which the body of
Jennifer Levin was found two years ago and the Dakota building on
72nd Street and Central Park West, where Beatle John Lennon was
murdered.
   A real estate broker who happened to be walking by the tour
group with a prospective client for an apartment on West 72nd
Street last week was no doubt less than pleased to hear the guide
refer to a seventh-floor studio as the place where the ``Looking
for Mr. Goodbar'' victim was strangled.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices were higher early Monday afternoon,
but below their best levels as market makers responded to a hike in
British interest rates with widespread markdowns.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 2.6
points, or 0.1 percent, at 1,878.5, at about 12:30 p.m., after
reaching as much as 9.3 points higher in early trading. The index
was up 8.5 points moments before the rate hike flashed across
traders' computer screens.
   Prices rose to their best levels in early business on the back
of an early round of buying by institutional investors. Also
boosting shares was widespread positive sentiment, reinforced by
favorable weekend press comment about London equities.
   But the signal by the Bank of England at about midday for a rise
in the commercial banks' base lending rate to 11 percent from 10.5
percent pulled shares sharply lower.
   The rate move, which took the market by surprise, sparked a bit
of selling, but markdowns took the biggest toll on shares, a dealer
said.
   Trading activity, after the early morning spurt in buying,
tapered off sharply by late morning. Activity was concentrated in a
few, selected shares that were the subject of market speculation or
brokerage recommendations.
   Stock exchange volume by midday was a modest 189.3 million
shares compared with 252.5 million shares at the same time Friday.

<HEAD>Farmer Aims To Reduce Production Costs, Protect Soil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GREENUP, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Terry Holsapple's rather unconventional
approach to farming began with a simple observation _ one crop can
help another crop grow.
   ``When we plowed down a crop of alfalfa, we had the best corn
ever,'' said Holsapple. ``I had been taught to use all these
chemicals. That really gets you to thinking.''
   So, Holsapple decided five years ago to abandon chemically
intensive agriculture and experiment with plants like hairy vetch
and rye. They control weeds, add nutrients and organic matter to
the soil, and protect the land from erosion _ the natural way, he
said.
   ``The yields have not suffered, in fact they might have picked
up a hair,'' said Holsapple, who now raises corn and soybeans with
fewer commercial fertilizers and pesticides. ``That's money in your
pocket.''
   Holsapple, 33, recently showed other interested farmers some of
the techniques _ successful and unsuccessful _ that he uses on his
400-acre farm in Cumberland County.
   It is one of 14 farms across the nation cooperating in
experiments sponsored by the Rodale Institute of Emmanus, Pa., a
nonprofit group doing research on regenerative agriculture.
   ``We need to diversify crops and methods, stop soil erosion and
rely less on fossil fuels,'' said Ken McNamara, Rodale's midwest
research coordinator. ``The systems we develop here will be around
for our children and our grandchildren.''
   During a wagon tour of his farm, Holsapple offered some pointers:
   _Fall-planted hairy vetch can be turned under the soil in the
spring to supply nitrogen for corn, eliminating the need for that
fertilizer in commercial form.
   ``These cover crops don't let weeds get started in the spring,''
said Holsapple. ``That vetch will even smother out horseweed.''
   _A field of tall, lush corn was cultivated to kill weeds and
grasses before they got a good start. Herbicides are a last resort.
   ``You've got to have a rotary hoe or you might as well throw up
your hands and go to town,'' said Holsapple, who paid $15 for a
small used one at a sale. ``If that doesn't work, you can always
come back and spray later.''
   _A field of dead vetch and little corn demonstrated the problem
of planting the grain into the vetch without plowing during a dry
year. The vetch sucked all the moisture out and the corn didn't
germinate.
   Holsapple also experiments with spring peas as a cover crop to
provide nitrogen for corn.
   He raises melons and other produce in small irrigated fields to
sell locally.
   He produces his own seed for vetch, rye and soybeans, buying
only commercial hybrid corn seed.
   And, he adds fertilizers only when a soil test indicates it will
be cost effective.
   ``We just keep trying things,'' said Holsapple. ``The more I do
this, the more enthused I get.''
   Holsapple said the trial-and-error and the work involved in this
kind of farming operation are worthwhile, from a social and
economic standpoint.
   ``There's more profit _ no doubt about it.''

<HEAD>Chubb Offers Farmers Double-Premium Refund</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 3,300 of the 8,717 applicants for
insurance by the Chubb Group of Insurance Companies in Ohio and
nine other Midwestern states have accepted the company's offer to
refund double their premiums.
   Chubb made the offer last month after agents sold $400 million
in drought insurance coverage to farmers. The underwriter had
authorized only $30 million worth of the coverage to be sold. Chubb
contends that a flood of applications in the last days the
insurance was available caused it to be oversold.
   The company operated a 125-person telephone bank during the
weekend to call 3,500 other applicants, even though the deadline
for the double-premium refund expired Friday.
   Chubb said Friday that 852 farmers had accepted the drought
insurance policies originally offered and 106 farmers who were
offered policies decided instead to take the double-premium offer.
Another 359 farmers were ruled ineligible for the insurance because
their applications were too late.
   Chubb offered up to $40 million of insurance nationwide in July
to the applicants on a first-come, first-served basis. Other
farmers who met the deadline were offered double their premiums
back.
   Ohio regulators investigating the drought insurance issue will
subpoena more people next week to explain how the insurance was
marketed.
   ``More questions have been triggered by some of the testimony
we've heard'' during the first week of public meetings, said George
Fabe, director of the Ohio Department of Insurance.
   The department next week will try to sort out which questions
remain and who should be called in to answer them, Fabe said.
Public meetings will probably resume the following week.
   The drought insurance was structured to pay farmers for the lack
of rain between June 1 and Aug. 31, based on a sliding scale. About
600 Ohio farmers applied for the insurance.

<HEAD>Commercial Banks Raise Interest Rates to 11 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's leading commercial banks, heeding a
signal from the Bank of England, announced on Monday a half-point
increase in their base lending rate to 11 percent.
   The central bank, seeking to control inflation, has signaled
seven half-point increases in the benchmark lending rate since
early June, when the rate stood at 7.5 percent. The last increase
was announced on July 18.
   Britain's annual inflation rate stood at 4.6 percent in June.
   A spokesman for the central bank, who wasn't identified in
accordance with British practice, said the latest increase was made
to ``assert the counter-inflation strategy.''
   The Treasury said it was the government's view that the economy
was growing ``at an unsustainable rate and needed to be slowed down
a bit.''
   The Bank of England signaled the rate rise at about midday by
announcing that it was raising its own money market rates.
   Barclays Bank PLC, Midland Bank PLC, Lloyds Bank PLC and
National Westminster Bank PLC quickly raised their base rate.
   Corporate borrowers can obtain loans at one percentage point
above the commercial banks' base lending rate.
   The pound rose after the announcement, which dealers said took
the market by surprise. The pound was selling for $1.6960 after the
bank's signal, up from $1.6915 in late-morning trading.

<TEXT>
   China will open a nationwide bond market at the
end of this year to curb black market trading in sought-after
government bonds, the Finance Ministry said.
   A ministry spokesman said the decision to open the market for
Treasury bonds came after experiments with bond markets in 61
Chinese cities in the first half of the year, the official People's
Daily reported Monday.
   A main purpose of the new market will be to stop
``bond-speculating lords'' who purchase non-matured bonds at low
values and resell them at higher prices, the newspaper said.
   Bonds have become popular among the Chinese because they offer
higher interest rates than regular savings accounts. Bonds issued
in 1985 earn an annual interest rate of 9 percent redeemable after
five years, while 1986 and 1987 bonds pay 10 percent interest.
   China issued 36.2 billion yuan, or about $9.8 billion, worth of
government bonds from 1981 to 1987 to help finance its economic
development programs.
   The government also has permitted some state and collective
enterprises to raise funds by issuing bonds and stocks, and small
stock exchanges are operating in Shanghai, Beijing and some other
cities.

<TEXT>
   Charles T. Price, senior vice president and
general manager of the Chicago Sun-Times, has been named acting
publisher of the newspaper until a replacement is found for Robert
E. Page.
   Price's interim appointment was announced Saturday by Sun-Times
Chairman Leonard P. Shaykin. Shaykin is a managing partner of Adler
& Shaykin, the investment firm that spearheaded a $145 million
leveraged buyout of the newspaper from international media magnate
Rupert Murdoch in 1986.
   Page announced on Thursday that he was selling his minority
interest in the newspaper company to the investor group that owns
it and stepping down as the Sun-Times' president and publisher.
   Shaykin said Price would serve as acting publisher while the
search for a new publisher continues.
   Price, 44, formerly was a partner in the Cleveland law firm of
Baker & Hostetler, where he represented the Sun-Times and other
newspapers.
   The 52-year-old Page decided to leave the newspaper about a
month ago and the deal to buy out his stake _ believed to be around
10 percent _ was consummated Thursday for as much as $2.5 million,
the Tribune said.
   Page came to Chicago from Murdoch's Boston Herald to serve as
the Sun-Times' president and publisher in 1984 after the
Australian's News America Publishing Corp. bought the paper from
its long-time owners, the Field family of Chicago.
   When Murdoch sold the Sun-Times to the investors' group, Page
said he was embarrassed by some of the newspaper's sensationalism
under Murdoch and promised ``a more serious, more purposeful'' look.

<HEAD>Hospital Administrators Blame Technology for Rising Health Care
Costs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many hospital administrators list new
technology as a major cause of escalating health-care costs,
according to a new poll.
   The poll appears in the Monday issue of HealthWeek newspaper. It
was released in New Orleans Sunday, the day before the American
Hospital Association was to open its three-day convention here.
   According to the poll, 32 percent of hospital administrators see
technology as the most important contributor to rising health-care
costs.
   In addition to blaming technology for boosting costs, the
administrators cited labor costs and salaries (20 percent),
government regulations (10 percent), personnel shortages, and lack
of reimbursement as other leading causes the study reprots.
   The SRI Gallup poll, conducted by phone among 100 administrators
at 27 rural, 38 urban and 35 suburban hospitals across the country,
examines issues affecting the delivery of health care services.
   The poll, which has an error range of plus or minus 9.8 percent,
said that 78 percent of the hospital administrators believe the
federal government's cost-containment errors are hurting the
quality of hospital patient care.
   Seven in 10 of the respondents said their hospitals make a
profit on overall patient revenues, one-third said they did not.
   Asked if their hospitals make a profit on Medicare patients, 64
percent said they did not.
   Although 51 percent of the administrators said there has been no
substantial change in the difficulty of getting malpractice
insurance in the past five years, and 11 percent feel it is easier
to get now, 33 percent said it is more difficult to obtain
malpractice insurance today.
   Utilization review, a highly publicized cost-containment
practice, has improved the quality of care for 50 percent of the
hospitals, but 32 percent of the administrators said the practice
had no effect and 17 percent said it had actually hurt the quality
of care.
   Nearly one in four administrators, the largest percentage of
respondents to the question, believes the number of AIDS patients
will increase by 26 percent or more in the next five years.
   Four in five believe it is unacceptable for a medical
professional to refuse to treat an AIDS patient, the study
indicates.
   Commenting on the nursing shortage, seven in 10 administrators
believe it presents a moderate to serious problem.
   Most administrators, 78 percent, are convinced that substantial
pay boosts would have no impact on the nursing shortage according
to the poll.
   HealthWeek is a newspaper serving the health industry. SRI
Gallup, based in Lincoln, Neb., is a health-care marketing research
firm and is a sister group to the Gallup Organization.

   South Korean companies paid $321
million in royalties for high-technology imports from the United
States and other countries during the first half of the year,
government figures show.
   Statistics published Monday by the Ministry of Finance showed
that the royalty payment for the first half was up from $226
million in the same period in 1987.
   Officials attributed the sharp increase to South Korea's growing
demand for high technology for electric, electronic and chemical
products and machinery.
   Royalties for electric and electronic technology more than
doubled, to $134 million from $66 million a year earlier, according
to the statistics.
   Royalty payments for machinery during the six-month period rose
19.6 percent, to $61 million. Royalties for oil refining and
chemicals doubled, to $54 million.
   The United States was the largest supplier of technology to
South Korea during the period with $161 million, followed by Japan
with $112 million, West Germany with $10 million and France with $8
million.

   Cocoa is the fourth commodity to be traded on the 8-year-old
exchange, along with tin, palm oil and rubber. The Kuala Lumpur
exchange is the first futures market for cocoa in Asia.
   Malaysia is the world's third-largest producer of cocoa after
the Ivory Coast and Brazil.
   Trading in cocoa futures was officially launched by Malaysian
Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik with a stroke at the
``bedok,'' a traditional village drum of the coastal Bajau
community. Trading was described as brisk.
   The cocoa contract for delivery in September opened at $1,280 a

<HEAD>Crop Futures Open Sharply Lower On Rain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened sharply lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction to
heavier-than-expected weekend showers on the northern and western
edges of the Corn Belt.
   The thunderstorms were expected to roll into the central Midwest
today, bringing badly-needed moisture and cooler temperatures to
drought-stressed corn and soybean fields.
   ``The weather over the weekend and the next couple of days looks
to be much better than expected,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Prices for future delivery of corn and soybeans flirted with
their respective daily limits of 10 cents and 30 cents a bushel in
early trading. Rain would improve the condition and yield prospects
of those crops, especially with most soybean fields in their
critical pod-filling stage.
   Traders are anxiously awaiting Thursday's crop progress report
from the Agriculture Department, which is expected to reveal a
worsening of crop conditions during July.
   In early trading, wheat was 2 cents to 5 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.74 a bushel; corn was 6{
cents to 10 cents lower with September at $2.99 a bushel; soybeans
were 21 cents to 31{ cents lower with the limitless August contract
at $8.45 a bushel; oats were 4{ cents to 9 cents lower with
September at $2.78{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .47 cent lower to .23 cent higher with August
at 68.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .27 cent lower to .20
cent higher with August at 79.55 cents a pound; hogs were .25 cent
lower to .18 cent higher with August at 45.85 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .13 cent to .85 cent higher with August at 32.80
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled higher on Friday.

<HEAD>CBS Agrees To Buy Miami TV Station</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cash-rich CBS Inc., announcing its first
television station purchase since Laurence A. Tisch took over as
president nearly two years ago, said today it has agreed to buy
WCIX-TV in Miami for $59 million.
   CBS said it also agreed to assume certain program obligations
valued at about $13 million as part of the deal for the station,
which operates on Channel 6 in Miami and is owned by TVX Broadcast
Group Inc. of Norfolk, Va.
   Completion of the deal is subject to regulatory approval.
   WCIX is an independent station, and its acquisition would
increase the number of TV stations that CBS owns and operates to
five, reaching about 20.8 percent of the country. CBS also operates
the CBS television network.
   CBS has faced criticism from its affiliates for failing to
expand its station holdings, particularly in light of the $3
billion in cash that the company has built up as it sold
non-broadcast assets, such as its records and magazines divisions,
over the past two years.
   The companies that own the other two major networks each own
more stations. ABC's parent owns eight stations and NBC's parent
owns seven.
   Tisch has responded by saying that while he wanted to make a
station purchase, the prices being asked were too high.
   CBS currently owns stations in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles
and Philadelphia that reach about 19.4 percent of the country's
viewers.
   Federal regulations limit a network to owning no more than 12
stations reaching a maximum 25 percent of the country.
   CBS already has an affiliate in Miami, but the station, WTVJ,
was acquired by NBC last year for about $270 million. That station
has continued to carry CBS programs, however, under an affiliation
agreement that ends in January.
   Miami is the nation's 16th largest television market. ``The
exciting and fast-growing Maimi market offers a terrific expansion
opportunity for us,'' said Eric Ober, president of the CBS-owned
television station division.
   Tisch was quoted in a statement as saying the purchase
``reflects the commitment of the board and senior management to
make sound investments in good broadcast properties in attractive
local markets.''
   ``We are continuing to evaluate other potential properties with
an eye toward further acquisitions,'' he said.
   Ths acquisition would be the second major purchase by Tisch in
the past four months. CBS bought the broadcast rights for 1992
winter Olympics for $243 million in May.

<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and gas rigs in the
United States jumped this week by 51 to total 945, Baker Hughes
Inc. reports.
   In last week's tally, the rig count had dropped by nine to total
894. A year ago this week, the count was 983, the company announced
Monday.
   Baker Hughes' rig count, the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity, reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December
1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plunged
to less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the
rig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Texas showed the greatest
increase with 19, followed by Oklahoma with 10. Colorado gained
five, followed by Louisiana with four and Wyoming with three.
Kansas and Ohio each gained one rig.
   North Dakota, meanwhile, fell by three, while New Mexico and
Pennsylvania each declined by one. Michigan and California had no
change.

   The stock market was little changed today, still
mired in uncertainty about the outlook for inflation and interest
rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 14.94 points
Thursday and Friday, recovered 2.31 to 2,121.44 by noontime today
on Wall Street.
   But losers slightly outnumbered gainers in the overall tally of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 573 up, 595 down and
599 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders remained concerned about a possible
increase in inflationary pressures and rising interest rates.
   News Friday of continuing expansion in payroll employment during
July prompted increased talk that the Federal Reserve might tighten
credit further.
   ``The Fed is being restrained and cautious in its moves toward
firmness, but the economic data continue to argue that a still
firmer stance is likely in the near future,'' said analysts William
Griggs and Leonard Santow at Griggs & Santow Inc. in their
financial commentary for this week.
   But brokers also said recent evidence of a strong economy
suggested that the large increases in corporate earnings posted in
the second quarter might continue at least for the balance of 1988.

   Bond prices were little changed today in quiet
dealings as traders geared up for the government's quarterly
refunding.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue, which fell } point or
$7.50 per $1,000 in face amount on Friday, was off 1-32 point at
midday.
   Its yield, which moves inversely to its price, held at 9.12
percent, unchanged from late Friday.
   Analysts said they expect traders to snap up the $11 billion in
three-year notes the government is scheduled to sell on Tuesday.
Another $11 billion in 10-year issues will be sold the following
day.
   ``While the economy is clearly stronger than people anticipated,
and that should knock the bond market down, good buying interest in
the refunding is supporting'' the credit markets, said Mitchell
Held, chief financial economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   Bondholders worry that a strong economy will bring about higher
inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income securities and
causes interest rates to rise.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments fell 3-32 point to 1-16 point, intermediate maturities
were 1-32 point to 1-16 point lower, and long-term issues were off
5-32 point, according to Telerate Inc., the financial information
service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   Corporate bonds were slightly higher. Moody's Investment Grade
Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.15
to 283.86.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills slipped to 7.08 percent as
the discount rate fell 1 basis point to 6.88 percent. Yields on
six-month bills rose to 7.61 as the discount rose 2 basis points to
7.25. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.03 percent as the discount
rose 2 basis points to 7.48 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth
of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an
investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the percentage that
bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 7} percent, up from 7 11-16 percent late Friday.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices were little changed on London's Stock
Exchange Monday after the market stumbled on news of an unexpected
hike in British interest rates.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index settled up
0.1 point, or 0.01 percent, at 1,876.0.
   Trading volume was a light 369.2 million shares, sharply lower
than Friday's volume of 416.4 million shares.
   Most of Monday's trading volume came within the first three
hours of business.
   Prices rose to their best levels in early trading on the back of
buying by institutional investors and on widespread positive
sentiment, reinforced by favorable weekend press comment about
London equities.
   But a signal by the Bank of England for a rise in bank base
lending rates to 11 percent from 10.5 percent pulled prices sharply
lower after midday.
   Market watchers said the rate rise caught them completely off
guard.
   ``It was a bolt of lightning from out of the blue,'' one analyst
said.
   Grand Metropolitan PLC, a British liquor and restaurants group,
was the largest gainer on the day, jumping 26 pence, or 44 cents,
to 522 pence a share after the company said it was considering
selling its Inter-Continental Hotels unit.

<HEAD>Drilling To See If City of Culture Sits on Crude Oil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE GANLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The City of Light is a treasure trove of cultural,
archeological and historical gems. Oil companies hope it also holds
black gold.
   On Tuesday, Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine plans to begin
drilling an exploratory oil well on the southern doorstep of Paris
at Ivry-sur-Seine _ the first of several wells in a program that
also envisions exploring within the city itself.
   ``I don't think Paris will ever be Houston,'' said Jean Perrot,
Elf's assistant director of exploration in France. ``But there is
still oil to be found in the Paris Basin.''
   The basin is a 50,000-square-mile expanse stretching eastward
from Paris to the West German frontier.
   Exploration surged in the basin after the discovery in April
1983 of considerable oil deposits at the Chaunoy field, which is in
a rural region about 50 miles south of the capital best known for
its tender white Brie cheese.
   The Ivry site, barely a mile outside the Paris city limits, is
being explored under a permit awarded in December 1985 to Elf,
Total Compagnie Francaise des Petroles and British Petroleum. The
587 square miles covered by the permit includes the city of Paris,
where limited seismic tests already have been carried out.
   It will take as much as four weeks to determine whether Ivry
contains marketable reserves, and whether they might extend inside
the city. But, Perrot said, ``it is quasi-certain that even with a
total failure in Ivry, there will be other exploratory wells.''
   Total said it definitely will drill an exploratory well, likely
before the end of the year.
   In their exploration campaign, the companies say they have
already spent more than the 70 million francs _ about $11.6 million
_ required under the five-year permit, mostly for seismic tests.
   There are more than 1,000 exploratory wells in the Paris Basin,
which produces nearly two-thirds of France's modest oil output.
Some oil also is being pumped from the Aquitaine region of
southwestern France and, minimally, from Alsace on the eastern
frontier. All the regions together produce less than 5 percent of
France's needs.
   The Ivry well is the first to be drilled so close to Paris.
   ``If we are encouraged by Ivry, we will be encouraged to do more
studies of Paris,'' said Alexis Poutchkovsky, a spokesman for Elf.
   ``We could easily find locations'' for derricks within the city,
he said. ``Look at the number of wells in Los Angeles.''
   Oil derricks would not rival the Eiffel Tower for attention,
though. Experts say stadiums, disused factories or even a
discretely moored boat on the Seine River could serve as sites for
horizontal drilling, by which oil is extracted sideways.
   ``We are looking at all solutions,'' Poutchkovsky said.
   Limited seismic readings of the capital were carried out in 1986
when specially equipped trucks sounding out the city depths rolled
down the Champs Elysees while Paris slept.
   More extensive seismic readings showed favorable structures in
Ivry, nearby Orly, Chenevieres to the east, and Roissy to the
north, according to Elf and Total, the two operators on the permit,
which gives Elf a 50 percent share, Total 35 percent and British
Petroleum 15 percent.
   To the uninitiated, exploring for oil in the highly urbanized
Paris region may be akin to searching for water in a desert. But
specialists say about one in five exploratory wells in the Paris
Basis are successful, or about twice the industry's standard ratio.
   Still, ``you will never find a giant (oil field) in the Paris
Basin,'' said Poutchkovsky, nothing the basin has proven reserves
of only about 280 million barrels. By contrast, the biggest oil
basin in the United States, Prudhoe Bay, has 8 billion barrels of
known reserves _ and Saudi Arabia has 167 billion barrels.
   France knew it had oil centuries ago when miners in Alsace
caught drippings in buckets.
   The Paris Basin's first well was discovered in 1958, but it was
not until the Chaunoy find by Esso SAF, the French subsidiary of
Exxon Corp., that the industry took serious notice.
   About 15 companies were operating in the region at the time of
the Chaunoy discovery. Today there are as many as 90, many of them
foreign.
   Triton France, a subsidiary of Triton Energy Corp. of Dallas,
has been established in France since 1980. The first foreign
company to operate in the Paris Basin, it now ranks No. 4 overall
with a production rate of 10,000 barrels a day, said Emmanuel
Mousset, Triton France's director of exploration.
   France had a record year in 1987, producing 22.4 million barrels
of oil. But that was dwarfed by the 464.7 million barrels it
imported.
   Industry executives say costs of extracting the crude are higher
than in the United States and benefits remain marginal.
   ``Exploration is a long affair. To recover investments is a long
process and we are now beginning to recover ours,'' said Mousset at
Triton France.
   Mousset said Triton France, which is associated with Total in 80
percent of its operations, was disappointed not to have a slice of
the exploration permit for the area around the capital.
   ``They have as much chance of finding oil there as anywhere
else,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The dollar closed higher against all the major
currencies except the British pound in European trading Monday.
Gold prices were mixed.
   The pound rose after British commercial banks raised their base
lending rate by half a percentage point to 11 percent, the second
increase in less than a month.
   Traders said the dollar gained after the news late last Friday
of a higher-than-expected rise in the number of Americans at work.
That would pump more money into the American economy and started
speculation that U.S. interest rates will be raised soon to control
inflation.
   The West German central bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve made
concerted sales of dollars Monday to stem the dollar's rise and
pulled the dollar back from its highest levels of the day, dealers
said.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7022 late Monday, more
expensive for buyers than Friday's late $1.6977.
   Other late rates Monday, compared with Friday's late rates,
included: 1.9000 West German marks, up from 1.8890; 1.5857 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5757; 6.3950 French francs, up from 6.3675;
2.1435 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1315; 1,399.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,393.00; 1.2097 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2050.
   Earlier in Tokyo the dollar exchanged at 133.97 Japanese yen at
the close, up from 133.12 yen. In London later the dollar traded at
133.60 yen.
   Gold bullion prices were higher in London, the major market, and
lower in Zurich. Swiss traders said trading was dull and low in
volume.
   Gold closed in London at a bid $432.25 a troy ounce, up from
$432.10 late Friday, and in Zurich at $432 bid, down from $433.
   Gold in Hong Kong closed at $434 bid, up from Saturday's $433.99.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $6.78 a troy
ounce, down from $6.89.

<HEAD>Bondholders File Suit Against American Brands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of 19 institutional investors filed suit
Monday charging that American Brands Inc. violated securities laws
by misstating facts when it offered to buy $1.5 billion in debt as
part of its acquisition of E-II Holdings Inc.
   The complaint, filed against both companies in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan, seeks $350 million in damages.
   Holders of E-II's long-term debt passed up an opportunity to
sell out in late February. American Brands offered to buy two
issues of debt at 103 percent and 104 percent of face value plus
accrued interest, but the offer expired without the company
receiving anywhere near the 51 percent response needed to trigger
the purchases.
   The bonds currently are trading below the price offered by
American Brands.
   The bondholders, led by Prudential Insurance Co., Columbia
Savings and Loan Association and Forstmann-Leff Associates, claim
they based their decision not to sell on American Brands' assertion
that it would retain E-II as a wholly owned subsidiary.
   The plaintiffs, who hold about $600 million of E-II's $1.5
billion in outstanding debt, had expected American Brands to sell
only a ``few segments of E-II's businesses that did not fit into
the core business strategy.''
   Four months later, however, American Brands announced it would
sell most of E-II _ including its debt _ to Riklis Family Corp.
American Brands paid Riklis to retain five E-II businesses.
   E-II's outstanding debt is now the obligation of Riklis.
   In their lawsuit, the bondholders allege American Brands
``pursued a secret strategy completely inconsistent with the
statements made in the tender offer document'' when it was
acquiring E-II shares in February for $17.05 a share, or about $2.7
billion including debt.
   American Brands spokesman Daniel Conforti said the company had
been advised that ``the suits are without merit.'' He said American
Brands ``made it clear at the outset that we would not assume the
indebtedness.''
   American Brands disclaimed any legal responsibility for the
bonds before the merger with E-II was completed, saying the debt
would remain E-II's responsibility once it became a subsidiary.
   The suit seeks compensatory and punitive damages. The two bond
issues in question come due in March 1997 and March 1999. Interest
payments on the debt total about $194 million, according to
published estimates.

<HEAD>Corn, Soybeans Plunge Their Limits On Rain Fears</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn, oat and soybean futures plunged their
permitted daily limits on the Chicago Board of Trade Monday in
reaction to unexpectedly heavy showers sweeping slowly across the
Corn Belt.
   Wheat futures also closed lower.
   A storm system that brought up to an inch of rain to much of
Minnesota, Wisconsin and northern Iowa on Sunday was expected to
pour water Monday night and Tuesday on drought-stressed crops in
the central Midwest.
   ``There's rain around and there's more rain coming,'' said
Victor Lespinasse, a trader for the investment firm Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. ``That's what broke the back of the bulls today.''
   Cooler temperatures were expected in the storm system's wake.
The crops were badly in need of both moisture and cooler
conditions, especially the soybean crop, which is in the middle of
its most vulnerable growth phase.
   Lespinasse called the sell-off ``very gradual, very orderly.''
   Prices opened sharply below Friday's closing levels, then
gradually fell their limits _ 10 cents a bushel for corn and oats,

   The stock market eked out a narrow gain today,
still mired in uncertainty about the outlook for inflation and
interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 14.94 points
Thursday and Friday, recovered 1.25 to 2,120.38 by 3 p.m. today on
Wall Street.
   Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 695 up, 655 down and 550
unchanged.
   Analysts said traders remained concerned about a possible
increase in inflationary pressures and rising interest rates.
   News Friday of continuing expansion in payroll employment during
July prompted increased talk that the Federal Reserve might tighten
credit further.
   ``The Fed is being restrained and cautious in its moves toward
firmness, but the economic data continue to argue that a still
firmer stance is likely in the near future,'' said analysts William
Griggs and Leonard Santow at Griggs & Santow Inc. in their
financial commentary for this week.
   But brokers also said recent evidence of a strong economy
suggested that the large increases in corporate earnings posted in
the second quarter might continue at least for the balance of 1988.
   Interco climbed 3} to 72. City Capital Associates raised its
offer for the company from $64 a share to $70 a share.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.21 to 153.30. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .34 at 304.61.
   Volume on the Big Board came 125.49 million shares with an hour
to go.

   The dollar finished higher against most major
currencies Monday despite concerted central bank intervention to
stem its rise.
   Gold prices were mixed. Republic National Bank of New York said
gold was bid at $430.20 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from
$432 an ounce late Friday.
   The dollar gained ground at home and in Europe as traders
continued to react favorably to last week's better-than-expected
employment report for July and revised data for June.
   ``The dollar continues to advance on the strength or perceived
strength of the U.S. economy,'' said James McGroarty, vice
president at Discount Corp.
   ``People are feeling optimistic that the (Federal Reserve) might
move further in terms of raising interest rates'' to hold down
inflation, he said. Higher interest rates make dollar-denominated
investments more attractive.
   Both the Fed and West Germany's Bundesbank intervened
sporadically throughout the session to keep the dollar from rising
too sharply against the West German mark. But while the action
slowed the dollar's rise, ``it's not stopping it,'' noted Ron
Sapiro, chief dealer at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
   The dollar pierced through 1.90 marks, a level not seen since
January 1987, forcing traders have had to revamp their outlook for
the dollar. Some now speculate that the U.S. currency could top
1.95 marks in the near-term.
   ``It seems the authorities are trying to send signals that they
are sincere in keeping the dollar from moving much higher, but the
market is choosing to ignore them,'' McGroarty said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar traded 133.97 Japanese yen at the close, up
from 133.12 yen. Later in London, the dollar traded at 133.60 yen.
In New York, the dollar closed at 133.73 yen, down from 133.88 yen
on Friday.
   The dollar fell against the pound after British commercial banks
raised their base lending rate by half a percentage point to 11
percent, the second increase in less than a month.
   In London, one British pound rose to $1.7022 late Monday, from
Friday's late $1.6977. In New York it cost $1.7005 to buy one
pound, more expensive than $1.6878 on Friday.
   But the dollar moved higher against most other currencies.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Friday, included: 1.9001 West German marks, up from 1.8948; 1.5883
Swiss francs, up from 1.5826; 6.4115 French francs, up from 6.3865;
1,402.00 Italian lire, up from 1,396.50, and 1.2110 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.2069.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Friday, included: 1.9000 West German marks, up from 1.8890; 1.5857
Swiss francs, up from 1.5757; 6.3950 French francs, up from 6.3675;
2.1435 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1315; 1,399.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,393.00; and 1.2097 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2050.
   Gold rose in Hong Kong to close at $434 a troy ounce from
Saturday's $433.99.
   In London, gold closed at a bid of $432.25 a troy ounce, up from
$432.10 late Friday. But it fell in light trading in Zurich to $432
an ounce from $433 Friday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for August
delivery fell to $430.40 a troy ounce from $432.30 late Friday.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $6.78 a troy
ounce, down from $6.89. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
August delivery slipped to $6.675 an ounce, from $6.855 late Friday.

   Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin announced a
$14.8 million plan Monday to meet the emergency survival needs of
thousands of migrant and seasonal farm workers left without money
or jobs because of the drought.
   But Rep. Albert Bustamante, D-Texas, said the Labor Department's
package is not enough to help migrant workers stranded across the
drought-parched Midwest without a job or enough money to finance
the return trip home.
   ``When you're looking at the amount of money big farmers,
agri-conglomerates are getting, they really are not providing for
the bottom-rung people who do the harvesting and stoop labor,''
Bustamante said.
   ``They should have been more fair in trying to bring relief to
these people,'' said Bustamante, himself a former migrant worker.
   Bustamante said he had sought $20 million to $25 million, which
would have come closer to ``meeting short-term survival needs.''
   A $3.9 billion package of drought assistance for farmers,
ranchers and dairy producers passed the Senate on Monday and could
receive final legislative approval as early as Tuesday in the House.
   Bustamante said he was working with House Majority Whip Tony
Coelho, D-Calif., and House Agriculture Committee Chairman E.
``Kika'' de la Garza to free up more money for the migrant workers.
   Mrs. McLaughlin promised the Labor Department would marshal
funds quickly. She said she also was writing to state governors and
agencies to recommend ``special employment services and
unemployment insurance consideration for migrant farm workers.''
   ``The severe drought in some parts of the nation has had a
devastating effect on migrant farm workers and their families,''
Mrs. McLaughlin said in a statement. ``Some are stranded without
work or money to return home, while others face extreme hardship at
their home base.''
   Mrs. McLaughlin said she has authorized existing migrant worker
programs operating under Labor Department grants to use up to 15
percent of their current funding for emergency services such as
health care, transportation and temporary shelter. The agency said
that could mean up to $9.5 million may be spent.
   She said another $5 million has been set aside from a Job
Partnership Training Act reserve account for displaced workers to
be used specifically for migrant farm workers hurt by the drought.
   The Labor Department also said portions of some states may be
declared disaster areas, triggering a disaster unemployment
insurance program.
   Twenty-two states have asked the Department of Agriculture to be
designated drought-disaster areas. These states have an estimated
200,000 migrant and seasonal farm workers, the Labor Department
said.
   They are Alabama, Delaware, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,
Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New
Jersey, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee,
Texas, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

   The stock market posted its third straight loss
Monday, still mired in uncertainty about the outlook for inflation
and interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 14.94 points last
Thursday and Friday, fell another 11.73 to 2,107.40.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
585 up, 781 down and 578 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 148.80 million
shares, up from 113.40 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 168.99 million shares.
   Analysts said traders remained concerned about a possible
increase in inflationary pressures and rising interest rates.
   News on Friday of continuing expansion in payroll employment
during July prompted increased talk that the Federal Reserve might
tighten credit further.
   ``The Fed is being restrained and cautious in its moves toward

   Phillips Petroleum Co. will sell its
oil and gas holdings in the Williston Basin of Montana and North
Dakota to Conoco for an undisclosed sum, company officials
announced Monday.
   The sale is part of Phillips' strategy to divest non-strategic
assets, company spokesman Dan Harrison said.
   ``It did not have a good fit for us,'' Harrison said of
Williston Basin.
   Since 1985, Phillips has sold gas plants at Williston and Tioga,
N.D., Harrison said.
   Conoco, a subsidiary of Du Pont Co., will obtain Phillips'
interest in about 175 oil and gas wells that produce about 4,000
barrels of oil and 2.8 million cubic feet of natural gas a day.
   Also included in the sale are 234,000 undeveloped acres in
eastern Montana and western North Dakota.
   Harrison said Phillips' interest in the Williston property
amounted to about 2,000 barrels of oil and 1 million cubic feet of
gas a day. He said Phillips' U.S. production last year was 113,000
barrels of oil and 772 million cubic feet of natural gas a day.
   Industry analysts say the amount of domestic oil and gas
reserves up for sale has about doubled in the past year because of
the market created by high exploration costs.
   The transactions usually reflect the seller's need to reduce
debt and the buyer's desire for proven production at a cost lower
than that of exploring for new reserves, the analysts said.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Plunge On Rain Prospects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn, oat and soybean futures plunged their permitted daily
limits Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade following unexpectedly
heavy showers on the Corn Belt's northwestern edge and forecasts
for rain in the central Midwest.
   On other markets, livestock and meat futures were mixed; energy
futures advanced; precious metals fell; and stock-index futures
retreated.
   Wheat futures also closed lower in Chicago. But with rain in the
forecasts, the selling pressure in the grain pits was focused on
corn and soybeans _ the crops that still stand to gain or lose,
depending on the weather.
   A storm system that brought up to an inch of rain to much of
Minnesota, Wisconsin and northern Iowa on Sunday was expected to
pour water on drought-stressed crops in the central Midwest on
Monday night and Tuesday.
   ``There's rain around and there's more rain coming,'' said
Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``That's
what broke the back of the bulls today.''
   Cooler temperatures were expected in the storm system's wake.
The crops were badly in need of both moisture and cooler
conditions, especially the soybean crop, which is in the middle of
its most vulnerable growth phase, analysts said.
   Lespinasse said the sell-off was ``very gradual, very orderly.''
   Prices opened sharply below Friday's closing levels, then
gradually fell their limits _ 10 cents a bushel for corn and oats,
and 30 cents a bushel for all soybean contracts except the August
contract, on which limits has been removed pending its expiration
on Aug. 22.
   After the close, the National Weather Service issued a
6-to-10-day outlook predicting above-normal temperatures and normal
rainfall in most of the Midwest during the first five days of next
week.
   In addition to watching the weather, grain traders are eagerly
awaiting Thursday's crop report from the Agriculture Department.
   The report will contain the government's first grain and soybean
production estimates based on field surveys and is expected to show
a deterioration of crop conditions during July.
   The USDA's last crop report was believed to have reflected most
of the drought damage done to the corn crop, with a predicted
production of 5.2 billion bushels, about 30 percent less than last
year.
   But intense speculation surrounds the USDA's soybean production
figure, which is expected to come out sharply lower than 1.65
billion bushels, the last official estimate.
   Soybean production estimates released by private grain analysts
over the last few days have ranged from 1.4 billion to 1.54 billion
bushels.
   Ted Mao, grain specialist in New York with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., said Thursday's USDA report ``will put to rest, to a
certain extent, the magnitude of ranges as far as crop damage
estimates are concerned.''
   Wheat settled 2\ cents to 6 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in September at $3.76\ a bushel; corn was 3{ cents to 10
cents lower with September at $2.96} a bushel; oats were 10 cents
lower across the board with September at $2.73{ a bushel; soybeans
were 13{ cents to 36{ cents lower with August at $8.40 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange in response to lower feed grain prices and
stronger cash markets, analysts said.
   Live cattle were .58 cent lower to .10 cent higher with August
at 68.47 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .55 cent lower to .17
cent higher with August at 79.37 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent
to .97 cents lower with August at 45.82 cents a pound; and frozen
pork bellies were .87 cent lower to .53 cent higher with August at
32.95 cents a pound.
   Energy futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange leaped higher
in late trading and closed on the day's highs in reaction to news
that Iran and Iraq had agreed to a cease-fire date of Aug. 20, said
Andrew Lebow, an analyst in New York with E.D.&F. Man International
Futures Inc.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 56 cents to 61 cents
higher with September at $15.87 a barrel; heating oil was 1.34
cents to 1.48 cents higher with September at 44.50 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was 1.39 cents to 1.44 cents higher with
September at 46.65 cents a gallon.
   Precious metals moved lower in mostly technically inspired
trading on New York's Commodity Exchange, said Craig Sloane, an
analyst in New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   Gold settled $1.80 to $1.90 lower with August at $430.40 a
pound; silver was 17.2 cents to 17.5 cents lower with September at
$6.715 a troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for September delivery of the Standard
& Poor's 500 index settled 2.40 points lower at 269.80.

<HEAD>Meese Approves Joint Agreement for Detroit News, Free Press</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Detroit News and Detroit Free Press will
be allowed to merge their business and production operations
because the smaller Free Press was in danger of financial failure
stemming from years of steady and apparently irreversible losses,
Attorney General Edwin Meese III said Monday.
   In approving the application for a joint operating agreement,
Meese rejected the recommendation of a Justice Department
administrative law judge who said the two newspapers' pricing
policies were unrealistic.
   Meese, however, said there was little prospect for the Free
Press to return to profitability in Detroit's highly competitive
market.
   ``For me, the continuing and persistent operating losses
suffered by the Free Press over the course of nearly a decade, with
no prospect of unilaterally reversing that economic condition in
the foreseeable future, describes a newspaper `in danger of
financial failure','' Meese said in his opinion.
   Meese told reporters that the Free Press' losses were not
manipulated but came ``from intense competition.''
   The Detroit joint operating agreement was the fifth approved by
the Justice Department under the Newspaper Preservation Act of
1970, which allows limited antitrust exemption to preserve
independent editorial voices in a community where one newspaper is
in danger of failing.
   Previous partial mergers were approved for newspapers in
Anchorage, Alaska, in 1974, Cincinnati in 1979, Chattanooga, Tenn.,
in 1980 and Seattle in 1982.
   The Free Press, owned by Knight-Ridder Inc., and the News, owned
by Gannett Co. Inc., had asked permission in May 1986 to merge
their advertising, circulation and production operations under a
law designed to preserve newspaper competition.
   The newspapers, which rank among the nation's 10 largest, said
the Free Press was in danger of going out of business without the
joint operating agreement. Knight-Ridder's directors had voted to
shut down the Free Press if the Justice Department had rejected the
application for a joint operating agreement.
   Knight-Ridder said in January that the Free Press' operating
losses had totaled $100 million since 1979, and that the News had
lost about $75 million in the same period. The Free Press lost $18
million on revenues of $172 million in 1987.
   ``This decision reaffirms the will of the Congress that two
independent editorial voices should be preserved wherever possible
in the cities of America,'' Alvah H. Chapman Jr., Knight-Ridder
chairman, said in a statement issued in Miami.
   Free Press Publisher David Lawrence said: ``This is the best
single day of my years at the Free Press. It leads the way to the
next century of service for the Free Press, which already has been
part of Michigan for more than a century and a half.''
   Gannett chairman Allen Neuharth and president John J. Curley
also expressed gratification.
   ``We said all along that the JOA was the only way to preserve
two independent news and editorial voices,'' they said in a
statement issued from Gannett headquarters in suburban Arlington,
Va. ``The attorney general's decision is in the best interest of
the community, the readers, the advertisers and the employees.''
   Said Jerry W. Friedheim, president of the American Newspaper
Publishers Association: ``While the administrative law judge in the
Detroit case misapplied the statute in some important ways, we are
pleased that the attorney general appears to have taken a view more
consistent with the intent of Congress.''
   A Justice Department administrative law judge, Morton Needelman,
recommended in December 1987 that Meese deny the request on grounds
that the newspapers' losses were due to unrealistic circulation and
advertising discounts aimed at forcing each other out of business.
   The newspapers denied Needelman's assertion, saying he lacked an
understanding of the newspaper business.
   Bruce McIntyre, publisher of the Oakland Press, one of several
suburban Detroit papers that had criticized the joint operating
agreement request, said he was ``quite surprised'' that Meese had
ignore the advice of the judge who had heard all the evidence in
the case ``and made a very studious decision.''
   While Meese was still considering the case, Free Press Editor
Joe Stroud rejected three cartoons about Meese by staff cartoonist
Bill Day. Another Knight-Ridder paper, the Miami Herald, also
decided not to publish editorial cartoons about Meese while the
case was pending.
   Newspaper employee unions and Detroit Mayor Coleman Young
initially opposed the partial merger, but most dropped their
opposition after Knight-Ridder directors voted to shut down the
Free Press if they failed to win approval of a joint operating
agreement.
   Meese said the owner's threat to close the Free Press was noted
in the record of the case, but was not the deciding factor in his
decision.
   The Newspaper Guild, the last employee union to oppose the joint
operating agreement, dropped its opposition July 25.
   Michigan Gov. James Blanchard and most of the Michigan
congressional delegation supported the agreement.
   The Free Press had circulation in March of 647,763 daily and
721,676 on Sundays, the 10th largest circulation in the nation,
according to the Audit Bureau of Circulation. The circulation of
the News was 688,211 daily and 836,331 on Sundays, the eighth
largest nationally, the bureau said.
   The Free Press was founded in 1831 and purchased by a
predecessor of Knight-Ridder in 1940. The News was founded in 1873
and purchased by Gannett in 1986.

   The nation's biggest airline company, Texas Air Corp., reported
Monday that its second-quarter net loss widened sharply, while
Trans World Airlines Inc. said its profit after taxes nearly
doubled.
   Houston-based Texas Air said its net loss widened to $255.9
million from a loss of $27 million in the second quarter of 1987.
The company blamed a significant part of the loss on government
investigations of alleged safety problems at its two main
subsidiaries, Continental Airlines and Eastern Airlines.
   Texas Air's second-quarter revenue slipped 1.4 percent, to $2.13
billion from $2.16 billion a year earlier.
   The Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation
Administration launched investigations of Eastern and Continental
in mid-April that were unprecedented in their scope. The probes,
which continued for most of the second quarter, concluded that both
airlines were being run safely.
   However, a federal report concluded that labor turmoil at
Miami-based Eastern must be defused before it creates risks to
passengers.
   Texas Air said Monday the investigations cost Eastern and
Houston-based Continental a total of more than $60 million in lost
revenue and $14 million in expenses such as overtime, advertising
and legal and accounting fees.
   ``Both airlines have implemented various marketing and service
programs to counter the effects of these investigations on consumer
confidence, but the companies have continued to experience some
revenue losses beyond the second quarter due to them,'' Texas Air
said in a press statement.
   At Eastern, the second-quarter net loss was $89.8 million,
compared with net income of $27.1 million a year earlier. Eastern's
revenue in the most recent quarter declined to $1 billion from $1.2
billion.
   Continental posted a $19.9 million loss before a $131 million
adjustment associated with a re-estimation of its air traffic
liability. The adjustment had been announced earlier and had no
impact on Continental's cash position, Texas Air said.
   Including the adjustment, Continental lost $150.9 million on
revenue of $1.1 billion in the second quarter. In the same period a
year earlier, the airline lost $71.1 million on revenue of $1
billion.
   The results in the latest quarter brought Texas Air's net loss
for the first half of the year to $380.1 million, widened from a
loss of $127.7 million in the first six months of 1987.
   Texas Air's first-half revenue rose 1.4 percent, to $4.26
billion from $4.20 billion.
   New York-based TWA said its net profit almost doubled in the
second quarter from a year earlier, largely due to a cash payment
it received from a lawsuit against its former owner, the late
Howard Hughes.
   The nation's seventh-largest airline said its net income jumped
to $97.2 million, or $2.70 a share, from $52.8 million, or $1.28 a
share, in the second quarter of 1987.
   In addition to a $49.9 million gain from the Hughes lawsuit, TWA
said its earnings also benefitted in the quarter from cost
controls, a rebound in international passenger traffic which had
been hurt by fears of terrorism, and the long-term advantages of
TWA's merger with Ozark Air Lines.
   TWA's second-quarter revenue rose 8.6 percent, to $1.14 billion
from $1.05 billion a year earlier.
   Profit in the latest quarter includes the $49.9 million gain
from a cash judgment awarded to TWA in 1987 in its long-standing
lawsuit against Hughes. The TWA management's suit, originally filed
in 1962, alleged that the eccentric multimillionaire failed to
provide the carrier with adequate aircraft.
   Although a Delaware court decided in TWA's favor last year, the
payment was not made until the second quarter.
   In the first half of the year, TWA earned $44.7 million, or 50
cents a share, compared with a net loss of $2 million in the first
six months of 1987.
   First-half revenue increased 9.6 percent, to $2.06 billion from
$1.88 billion.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Close Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices were mixed Monday, with long-term
issues rising and shorter maturities slipping.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue rose 7-32 point, or
about $2.20 per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves
inversely to its price, slipped to 9.10 percent from 9.12 percent
late Friday.
   Short-term governments, meanwhile, fell about 1-16 point.
Intermediate maturities were unchanged to 1-16 point higher and
20-year bonds fell 5-16 point, according to Telerate Inc., the
financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   Kevin Flanagan, a money market economist with the investment
firm Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said the long bond rose on the
strength of the dollar and a drop in commodities prices, which
lessen the possibility of inflation.
   ``Long bond people are basically thinking that inflation should
be under control,'' Flanagan said.
   Credit markets are concerned that increased inflation would
erode the value of fixed-income securities such as bonds.
   Traders also bought long bonds on optimism about Tuesday's
planned Treasury auction, in which three-year notes will be
auctioned, Flanagan said.
   On Wednesday, 10-year notes will be auctioned in the second day
of the government's quarterly refunding sale. The $22 billion sale
will not include 30-year issues because the Treasury has
practically exhausted its authority to issue them without
congressional action.
   Flanagan said the price of shorter-term issues fell because
traders expect the Federal Reserve to tighten credit.
   He said the market expected the Fed to allow the federal funds
rate, the interest charges for overnight loans between banks, to
rise. The fed funds rate traded at 7 11-16 percent late Monday,
unchanged from late Friday.
   The Shearson Lehman Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, rose 0.51 to 1,138.19.
   Corporate bonds also rose. Moody's Investment Grade Corporate
Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds
with maturities of five years or longer, advanced 0.38 to 284.09.
   In the tax-exempt market, general obligation and revenue bonds
rose 1-32 point from Friday, with the average yield unchanged at
8.02 percent, according to the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.04 percent as the
discount rate fell 5 basis points to 6.84 percent. Yields on
six-month bills rose to 7.60 percent as the discount rate rose 1
basis point to 7.24 percent. Yields on one-year bills were
unchanged at 8.00 percent as the discount rate was also unchanged
at 7.46 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   In an auction Monday, the Treasury sold $6.8 billion in new
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 6.94 percent, up
from 6.89 percent last week. Another $6.8 billion was sold in
six-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.26 percent, up
from 7.15 percent last week.
   The rates were the highest since Oct. 13, when three-month bills
sold for 6.96 percent and six-month bills averaged 7.34 percent.

<HEAD>Hershey Foods Selling Friendly Ice Cream</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HERSHEY, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hershey Foods Corp., deciding to jettison
its nine-year venture into the restaurant industry, said Monday it
is selling its Friendly Ice Cream Corp. to Tennessee Restaurant Co.
for $375 million.
   Richard A. Zimmerman, Hershey's chairman and chief executive,
said the company felt it could better use its resources
concentrating on its primary business _ consumer food products.
   ``Although Friendly has been a significant part of Hershey
Foods, our decision to sell Friendly is based upon our continuing
review of our strategic plan and evaluation of our business
portfolio,'' Zimmerman said in a statement.
   Hershey spokesman Carl Andrews said declining income and other
difficult conditions in the restaurant industry figured in
Hershey's decision.
   Income from the restaurant chain fell to $45.6 million in 1986
from $50.4 million in 1986.
   In its 1986 annual report, Hershey noted heightened competition,
lack of real sales growth, a decrease in customers and difficulty
finding workers.
   Two-thirds of the company's sales gain in the restaurant
division from 1985 to 1986 came from new and acquired restaurants
rather than from higher volume at existing restaurants.
   Besides its chocolate and confectionery products, Hershey also
produces several brands of pasta, including San Giorgio, Skinner
and American Beauty.
   Friendly, based in Wilbraham, Mass., owns and operates a chain
of about 850 restaurants, which feature moderately priced menu
items and ice cream specialities. Friendly's 1987 sales were $572
million.
   Hershey Foods said the transaction, which will give it an
after-tax gain, should be completed within three months, subject to
government approval.
   TRC, a private restaurant holding company based in Chicago, owns
about 51 percent of Perkins Family Restaurants, a publicly traded
limited partnership, and 100 percent of Perkins Management Co. Inc.
   Perkins owns and franchices more than 330 restaurants, primarily
in Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York and Florida.
   ``We are pleased to enter phase two of TRC's development with a
company boasting the high-quality reputation of Friendly,'' said
Donald N. Smith, TRC chairman and chief executive officer.
   He said Friendly has strong name recognition andd excellent
market penetration in the Northeast. Friendly will provide a solid
foundation for future growth, Smith said.
   Perkins and Friendly will be operated as separate companies,
Smith said.
   Hershey's move comes shortly after it announced plans to
purchase the U.S. confectionery operations of Cadbury-Schweppess
PLC of England for $270 million plus the assumption of $30 million
in debt.
   The purchase, still in progress, will give Hershey a wide array
of candy lines, stretching from its own well-known products,
including Reeses peanut butter candies, to Cadbury's Peter-Paul and
York products and Luden's 5th Avenue bar and cough drops.
   ``What we're finding is our area of strength is manufacturing,
with a primary focus on snacks and confectionery products,''
Andrews said.
   ``We do think that puts us in a leadership position of the total
U.S. confectionery market,'' he added.

<HEAD>Interco Rejects $70 A Share Offer From City Capital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interco Inc. on Monday rejected as inadequate a
sweetened $2.68 billion buyout offer from a Washington-based
investor group, and took moves to strengthen its defenses against
an unwanted takeover.
   The manufacturer and retailer of apparel and furniture stated
that in addition to rejecting the $70 a share merger proposal
offered earlier Monday by City Capital Associates, its board of
directors approved a plan to sell the company's apparel division,
which accounts for nearly a fourth of its sales.
   ``The Interco board concluded that the interests of the
company's shareholders were better served by the company's
continued pursuit of the restructuring of the company, which is
presently under consideration,'' the company said.
   Interco stock, which rose by more than $13 a share when the
group's initial offer of $64 a share was announced July 28, rose
$4.12{ to $72.50 a share on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The Interco board also amended its ``poison pill'' defense
against hostile takeover, so that it takes effect if a suitor
acquires 15 percent or more of Interco's 38.4 million outstanding
common shares.
   The company said the change was aimed at preventing an
open-market stock accumulation program following the announcement
of a proposal to acquire Interco or a ``street sweep'' that could
accompany or follow a tender offer for the company, in which all
Interco shareholders would not participate equally and at a fair
price.
   City Capital owns 8.7 percent, or 3.14 million, of Interco's
outstanding common shares.
   When it made its initial $64 a share offer, valued at about
$2.46 billion, City Capital said it might increase its bid based on
further review of information about Interco.
   The company had sales of $3.34 billion last year, with the
apparel group contributing about 24 percent.
   Interco manufactures men's and women's apparel, footwear,
furniture and home furnishings. Some of its brand names are among
the best known in the United States, including London Fog clothing,
Florsheim and Converse shoes, and Broyhill and Ethan Allen
furniture.
   In addition to its manufacturing operations, Interco operates
201 retail locations in 15 states, including home-improvement
centers, general merchandise discount stores, mens' specialty
apparel shops and specialty department stores.

   Newspaper employees and executives by turns
praised and criticized Attorney General Edwin Meese's approval
Monday of a partial merger of the Detroit Free Press with the
Detroit News.
   Champagne flowed in the newsroom at the Free Press, where the
decision brought relief after months of uncertainty over whether
Meese would approve the joint operating agreement between the
newspaper, the nation's 10th-largest, and the rival News.
   ``It was like a rush. Waiting for the decision is like living on
death row,'' said senior managing editor Neal Shine, who had been
assigned to write the newspaper's obituary if the joint operating
agreement with the News was denied.
   But critics labeled the deal a blow to competition in the
newspaper business.
   ``This is a travesty of the Newspaper Preservation Act,'' said
Lou Mleczko, a News reporter who is president of Newspaper Guild
Local 22. ``The two largest media companies in the world can take
two newspapers that are in a dead heat and get a monopoly.''
   Knight-Ridder Inc. had said it would close the 157-year-old Free
Press if the JOA with the News, owned by Gannett Co. Inc., was
denied.
   In Miami, top Knight-Ridder executives praised Free Press
employees for persevering under difficult conditions and praised
Meese for approving the JOA.
   ``This is good news for the loyal readers and advertisers of the
Free Press, for our hard-working and dedicated employees in Detroit
and for our shareholders who have shared the burden of enormous
operating losses in Detroit since 1979,'' Knight-Ridder chairman
Alvah H. Chapman Jr. said in a statement.
   Gannett chairman Allen Neuharth and president John J. Curley
also praised the decision.
   ``We said all along that the JOA was the only way to preserve
two independent news and editorial voices,'' they said in a
statement issued from Gannett headquarters in Arlington, Va. ``The
attorney general's decision is in the best interest of the
community, the readers, the advertisers and the employees.''
   Newspaper Guild Local 22, the last of the newspapers' unions to
drop its opposition to the JOA, nevertheless was critical of the
decision. The Guild, which has 1,100 members in the two newsrooms,
held out for better economic terms before agreeing to withdraw its
opposition.
   ``The losers in this are going to be the readers and advertisers
in southeastern Michigan and it could set a precedent where you'll
see the elimination of competitive journalism in cities throughout
the United States,'' said Mleczko.
   Mike Lloyd, editor of the Grand Rapids Press, the state's
third-largest paper, said he was pleased as a journalist that the
merger was approved.
   ``The loss of any daily newspaper would be considered a bad day
in journalism by even those of us who think of the Free Press as
serious competition,'' said Lloyd.
   Bruce McIntyre, publisher of the Oakland (Mich.) Press, said he
was surprised Meese would disregard the recommendation of the
administrative law judge who presided over hearings on the proposed
JOA.
   ``Judge (Morton) Needelman sat and listened to these things and
made a very studious decision on it, and it's hard to believe the
attorney general would so easily overturn what his own
administrative law judge recommended,'' McIntyre said.
   Reactions from Michigan politicians also varied.
   State Senator John Kelly of Detroit, who unsuccessfully sought a
new law blocking the JOA, said ``What has really happened is the
annihilation of the Free Press. It will be `Gannettized' and the
quality staff will be reduced because there will be no incentive
without any real competition.''
   But U.S. Sen. Carl Levin, a longtime Meese critic, complemented
the attorney general.
   ``Today's announcement shows what a united community can do and
what a united Michigan congressional delegation can do. Attorney
General Edwin Meese's response to that united community is very
gratifying indeed,'' Levin said.

<HEAD>U.S. Judge Rules Island Nation Owes $44 Million To Banks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge ruled Monday that the tiny South
Pacific island Republic of Palau must pay an international
consortium of banks more than $44 million on defaulted loans.
   The republic, a 200-island archipelago in the south central
Pacific Ocean about 600 miles east of the Philippines, borrowed
more than $30 million to build an electric power generating station
in the early 1980s.
   The nation, once a U.S. trust territory, in March defaulted on
the loans and the consortium that had guaranteed the loans had to
pay them off. The banks sued the country _ population 14,200 _ for
repayment.
   Under the decision, the banks _ Morgan Guaranty Trust, Morgan
Grenfell & Co. Ltd., Bank of Tokyo, Ltd., Bank of Scotland and
Orion Royal Bank Ltd. _ are entitled to collect some $44.3 million
in unpaid loans, capitalized interest, insurance premiums, fees and
expenses.
   In his 57-page opinion, U.S. District Judge Robert W. Sweet said
the case presented ``an involved factual matrix and complicated
issues of sovereignty and commercial law arising out of the
struggle of the unsophisticated island people of Palau to achieve
independence, both economic and political.''
   But the judge concluded the banks were entitled to collect the
amounts they had guaranteed.
   Sweet's ruling was the latest round in a three-year legal battle
between the banks, some of the largest in the world, and Palau,
whose main industry is fishing.
   ``This decision is but one step along what may turn out to be a
long road, but at least this phase has been completed,'' said Sweet.
   After a week-long trial in April and final arguments in June,
Sweet ruled that Palau willingly waived its right to sovereign
immunity, and thus protection from lawsuits, when it signed the
loan agreements. Sweet also ruled that Palau failed to prove its
contention that the banks had misrepresented how the power plant
would pay for itself or that Palauan officials signed documents
they did not understand.

   The U.S. dollar edged higher against the Japanese
yen in morning trading Tuesday, while stock prices eased.
   After opening at 133.62 yen, down from Monday's close of 133.97
yen, the dollar traded in a narrow range and by late morning was
changing hands at 133.70 yen.
   Traders said most currency market participants were monitoring
the dollar's movements against the West German mark. West Germany's
Bundesbank intervened in the market sporadically to keep the dollar
from rising too sharply against the mark in overseas markets.
   The dollar reached 1.90 marks during Monday trading, a level not
seen since January 1987.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, down 109.06 points on Monday, fell another 37.81
points to finish the morning session at 28,215.31.
   Dealers on the stock exchange said the market remained
relatively quiet as participants relaxed because of the summer
holidays.
