<HEAD>Merce Cunningham Company Presents a New Dance</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Merce Cunningham Dance Company, celebrating
its 35th anniversary with its longest New York engagement _ four
weeks _ presented a premiere by Cunningham on Wednesday night.
   The dance at the Joyce Theater, for 11 dancers, is titled
``Eleven.'' The music, by Robert Ashley, his first for the company,
is titled ``Problems in the Flying Saucer.'' The dance does not act
that out.
   As always with Cunningham, the dancers are proficient and
fluidly graceful. They shift weight and hold poses without
stiffness. A viewer may not know why one set of moves follows
another, but the dancers are entirely purposeful in performing them.
   Cunningham choreographs to use the entire stage, giving his
dancers the look of freedom. A couple dancing together may not
touch often but they stay in each other's general area. Circles are
negotiated slowly or spun with arms swinging broadly. Often one leg
is extended, while a dancer's body turns profile then turns again
to face the audience.
   Once, a woman dancers enters, walking with bent knees. It's
amusing because it's so different from the expansive movements that
other dancers on stage at that moment are doing.
   The ``music'' is two men talking, Michael Pugliese, with a
French accent, and Takehisa Kosugi, in a near monotone. Kosugi
composed the music for the other two dances on the evening's
program, ``Doubles'' and ``Grange Eve.'' Cunningham danced in
``Grange Eve.''
   Pugliese speaks first, saying a sentence fragment like ``there
is no sound'' or ``off in the daytime.'' Before he finishes a
phrase, Kosugi comes in on top of it, saying something like ``the
south of France.'' Even if one listens only to one speaker, phrases
don't add up to sentences and not all words can be understood.
   There are many pauses between sets of phrases. Since Cunningham
choreographs without music anyway, the dance flows on.
   Program notes explain that Ashley's work is an excerpt from a
screenplay for an opera, ``Odalisque,'' in which a lieutenant in a
flying saucer explains to his captain something about a musician
they have on board. The Cunningham Dance Foundation commissioned
this arrangement and instructions for performance.
   The present season, which ends March 27, also includes the New
York premiere of ``Carousal,'' done last summer at the Jacob's
Pillow dance festival; a revival of the 1968 ``RainForest,'' and
``Septet,'' which Cunningham created in 1953, his company's first
year. ``Septet'' is danced to Satie music; it was revived last year
after a 23-year absence from the repertory.
   After the Joyce season, the company will dance in San Paolo, Rio
de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte, Brazil, from April 8 through 15.
Starting June 4, it will play seven German cities in two weeks,
including presenting a premiere commissioned by the Berlin Festival.
   Another dance will premiere at the Avignon, France, Festival,
between July 30 and Aug. 3. U.S. summer dates include July 21
through 23 at the American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C., and Aug.
22 through 27 at Saratoga Springs, N.Y.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many prominent Panamanians say the
nation's entire system needs changing, not just the leader, and
even if Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega goes the United States may be
backing the wrong replacement.
   Eric Arturo Delvalle, the ousted president Washington supports,
tried to dismiss Noriega on Feb. 25 as commander of the Panama
Defense Forces. Noriega arranged for the legislature to dismiss
Delvalle instead, and the political and economic crisis has
deepened since.
   ``The United States is mistaken in putting so much behind
Delvalle,'' said Luis Moreno, former manager of Chase Manhattan
Bank's local operations and until January 1987 a member of the
government Banking Commission. Moreno, an independent, met
regularly with the president and Cabinet ministers.
   ``Delvalle and his people are spent,'' he said. ``Noriega is
laughing at this rallying behind Delvalle, saying `This guy can't
bring me down.'''
   The Reagan administration continues to recognize Delvalle, now
in hiding in Panama, as the country's legitimate leader and is is
applying economic pressure in an effort to get him back in office.
   Noriega was indicted in Florida last month on narcotics and
money-laundering charges, which he denies, and the Reagan
administration portrays him as little more than a gangster.
Washington has indicated the economic heat will end if he steps
down or is removed.
   Roderick Esquivel, who was Delvalle's vice president and was
removed with him, said: ``The object is not to change the face on
the regime but to dismantle an entire corrupt and repressive
apparatus of state.'' Esquivel, who also is in hiding, made the
comment during an interview at a safe-house.
   A former top official who left the government in a dispute with
Noriega said: ``In order to achieve democracy, it is the structure
that has to be broken, not Mr. Noriega.
   ``The colonels and majors are involved in the same businesses he
(Noriega) is involved in. That implies a great degree of
solidarity.''
   The Defense Forces control the executive and legislative
branches of government through the two political parties linked to
them and all judges are political appointees, including the Supreme
Court justices.
   ``Not only does the military control the three branches of
government, but it also controls the fourth estate, the media,''
said the former official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Noriega has closed all opposition media: three newspapers, two
radio stations and a television channel.
   Many people ask why Delvalle, who had followed Noriega's ordered
until the February revolt, is seen as the man to change things.
   ``Delvalle is important in that he changed the sense of
hemispheric support for the government (with his attempt to depose
Noriega), but he has always been on the sidelines,'' said Roberto
Brenes, a leader of the National Civic Crusade.
   The crusade, an alliance of about 200 business, professional,
labor and political organizations, has led opposition to Noriega
since it was formed last June.
   On Monday, it joined opposition parties in calling for a
government of national reconciliation and transition. The document
they issued did not say Delvalle would head such a government, but
recognized him as ``he who exercises the office of president.''
   Questions about what will and should happen next also dominate
the daily lives of average citizens in this country, which has the
Panama Canal as an integral part of its economy and uses U.S.
dollar as its national currency.
   Miguel Correa, a truck driver, noted that Delvalle, like others
of Noriega's recent critics, had been involved in his regime.
   ``Why the sudden change of heart, when they were all part of the
same dirty business?'' he said.
   Among Noriega's accusers hare retired Gen. Ruben Paredes, his
predecessor as Defense Forces commander; Jose Blandon, a former top
adviser, and retired Col. Roberto Diaz Herrera, Noriega's former
chief of staff.
   The joint statement by the crusade and the opposition parties
said Delvalle, by his actions, ``committed himself to the changes
necessary for establishment of a legitimate democracy.''
   This caution came from the former high official: ``The more time
that passes, the less viable becomes the Delvalle solution.''

   Two brothers pleaded guilty to attacking
the son of comedian-activist Dick Gregory and three other black
youths in an assault the judge called a sign of ``a cancer that is
growing in our society.''
   Kevin Ferreira, 23, and his brother Vernon, 19, pleaded guilty
Tuesday to assault and violating the civil rights of Christian
Gregory and the other blacks.
   Charges are pending against two other white men in the November
1986 attack at a party in Plymouth after a high school football

   Kevin Ferreira said the fight occurred because he was told that
Gregory and his friends referred to the other youths as ``white
honky trash.''
   Brockton Superior Court Judge George N. Hurd Jr. set sentencing
for April 15.

<HEAD>Jackson Has Home-Turf Edge In Pair Of Upcoming Contests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In this city, Jesse Jackson is the well-known
social activist, a canny player in the back rooms of a world-class
political hotbed.
   In Greenville, S.C., he's the hometown celebrity who hasn't
forgotten his roots.
   Jackson hopes to cash in on both images and turn hometown
sentiment into votes in two contests in the next week.
   South Carolina holds Democratic caucuses on Saturday; the
Illinois primary is Tuesday.
   Arriving under chilly gray skies back in Chicago on Wednesday,
Jackson was triumphant, telling a rally of factory workers, `We get
stronger every day.''
   Here, he founded the social action organization People United To
Serve Humanity. Here he makes his home, in a large comfortable
house on a pleasant residential street, with his wife Jacqueline
and five children.
   Halfway across the nation is Jackson's other hometown. It was
Greenville where Jackson stopped last week as he launched his final
swing through the South on the road to the critical Super Tuesday
contests.
   Jackson came in first in the popular vote in those primaries and
caucuses, and second to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in the
delegate count.
   In Greenville, they remember Jackson as the youngster who went
off to be a college football quarterback, then launched a career as
a minister and civil rights activist who followed Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr.
   Jackson saw familiar faces when his motorcade pulled up to the
Springfield Baptist Church last week to address a convention of
ministers. It was this church, he told them, that he attended as a
boy while his mother sang in the choir.
   Greenville, a medium-sized city set among rolling hills with a
rural atmosphere, was a major textile center in those days. But it
fell on hard times as the mills began to close, Jackson says.
   Jackson took reporters to the projects where he lived as a boy.
He went into his old apartment, a spartan brick unit with plastic
flowers on display, the home today of a single mother of two who
earns minimum wage putting pleats on skirts.
   The project's residents came out to shake Jackson's hand as he
strolled through the streets, Secret Service agents and TV cameras
in tow.
   Today, Jackson's mother lives in a comfortable split-level home
_ walls covered with tastefully framed photo layouts depicting
Jackson's life _ in a far more affluent neighborhood of Greenville.
   There, a group of friends and family members celebrated
Jackson's night at home with a feast of sweet potatoes, corn bread,
turkey, dressing, cobblers and other home cooking the likes of
which is seldom seen on Jackson's breakneck campaign.
   The next morning there was more home cooking _ biscuits and
grits, this time with white farmers on a dairy farm near town.
   South Carolina farmers told Jackson how the nation's farm policy
has brought them hardship. But they were noncommittal about whether
they would vote for him.
   There is no such reticence when Jackson gets home to Chicago, a
big industrial city whose people hurry along skyscraper-lined
sidewalks, bundled up against the icy blasts that whistle along the
streets and beneath the elevated rail cars.
   Here the crowds that come to see him are his fans.
   At the General Electric plant rally, the crowd knew what they
wanted the candidate to do.
   ``Jesse, help us save our jobs,'' their signs read.
   ``I've been working here 23 years,'' said Mack Fundes, a truck
driver for GE's Hotpoint refrigerator plant that is scheduled to
close in a couple of years.
   ``Nothing has changed here. It's time for change. I believe
Jesse would make a change,'' he said.

<HEAD>Gephardt Trudging On After Big Super Tuesday Setback</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FLORENCE, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Gephardt grimaced a bit as he
stood in a pole barn on a soggy afternoon, pondering a question
from the tiny knot of Democrats.
   The question was: ``Do you really think you can beat Jesse
Jackson and Al Gore here?''
   After a pause, Gephardt said: ``We're going to try very hard.''
   Throughout Wednesday, the day after his disastrous Super Tuesday
performance, Gephardt doggedly trudged across rain-drenched South
Carolina, trying to explain his showing and pleading with Democrats
to give him a boost in Saturday's caucuses.
   ``Unless you're willing to stand up for change, it's not going
to happen,'' Gephardt said. ``If you will stand with me on
Saturday, we'll change those facts of life.''
   Only a month ago, Gephardt was riding high after a win in the
Iowa caucuses. From there, he went on to a second-place finish in
New Hampshire, and won South Dakota's primary a week later.
   But suddenly, he is fighting to keep his campaign alive.
   The difficulty facing Gephardt was summarized at the Jim Harwell
farm just outside this eastern South Carolina town.
   As the recorded strains of country singer Willie Nelson wailed
mournfully in the background, Gephardt mingled with a couple of
dozen party activists in what was billed as a farm rally for him to
push some basic campaign themes he hopes will sway farmers in this
heavily rural state.
   Gephardt insisted throughout the day that his problem during the
20-state round of voting earlier in the week was the sheer size of
the event. He said it prevented him from telling his story, leaving
him victorious only in his home state.
   ``When I get my message out to the voters, I win,'' Gephardt
said. ``They didn't hear what I had to say; that was the problem.''
   But when Gephardt sounded his familiar tough-talking trade
themes they got a lukewarm response.
   That was partly because the audience was tiny. Only a couple of
dozen people showed up at the farm. At an event earlier in the day
at a threatened textile plant, his audience was composed almost
entirely of elementary-school students bused in for the occasion.
An evening rally in Greenville found the room half empty.
   That's the price Gephardt paid for his showing on the campaign
season's biggest event, as attention focuses on other candidates
like Gore, Jackson and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis who have
reaped big harvests of delegates.
   ``We did not have a good outcome yesterday,'' Gephardt said in a
significant understatement.
   But he spent a lot of his time insisting he's in the race for
the long haul.
   ``The race is on,'' Gephardt said. ``I'm not where I'd like to
be, but I think I have ample opportunity to make up lost ground and
get back in the middle of this race and win.''
   Gephardt and his aides conceded their campaign could badly use a
boost, and they busily drew up scenarios for keeping the effort
alive.
   ``It's going to be tough; it's an uphill battle,'' said deputy
campaign manager Joe Trippi. ``But that's what we're going to try
to do.''
   Throughout the Super Tuesday campaign, Gephardt was outspent by
both Gore and Dukakis, and campaign consultant Bob Shrum conceded
that a fourth-place showing won't make raising money any easier.
   ``It won't be as easy to raise money, but we'll raise money,''
Shrum said. ``We're not penniless.''
   Gephardt insisted his financial picture is not all that bleak.
His debts are modest, he says, and more federal matching funds are
on the way.
   ``We didn't borrow, as others did, to run on Super Tuesday,''
Gephardt said. ``Maybe in retrospect we should have.''
   But Gephardt faces big hurdles if he's to regain momentum.
   South Carolina is where Jackson was born, and Gephardt aide
concede that he best they can hope for Saturday is a second-place
finish.
   The Gephardt campaign has been downplaying next week's Illinois
primary, saying results will be muddled by home-state Sen. Paul
Simon's presence on the ballot.
   That leaves Gephardt with a long stretch before he's likely to
get any positive campaign news.
   He's pinning his hopes on Michigan, which holds caucuses March
26, as a key blue-collar state where he hopes his tough trade talk
will sell.
   It also drastically raises the stakes for Gephardt.
   ``We're going to do well in Michigan,'' he said. ``I need to do
well in Michigan.''

<TEXT>
   Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner, standing
arm-in-arm with his new girlfriend, announced a countersuit against
his ex-lover, alleging she was unfaithful and her $35 million
``palimony'' lawsuit was a publicity stunt.
   But model Carrie Leigh's attorney says her action was brought to
stop Hefner from using and discarding young women.
   The 61-year-old Hefner, who filed the $1 million cross complaint
Wednesday, said Ms. Leigh filed her lawsuit to advance her own
career and that of her lawyer, Marvin Mitchelson.
   ``You're talking about the criminal misuse of the judicial
system,'' Hefner told reporters as he stood with his new
girlfriend, 24-year-old Kimberley Conrad, at the Playboy Mansion.
``I want to put a stop to that.''
   Ms. Leigh could not be reached for comment because her phone
number is unlisted.
   Mitchelson, on vacation in Paris, said from his hotel:
   ``This is my 32nd year as a lawyer, and I've never filed a
lawsuit in my life that didn't have merit.
   ``The palimony suit was really developed to remedy situations
involving people like Hugh Hefner,'' he continued. ``He has made a
lifelong practice of getting involved with teen-age girls, living
with them for a few years and then discarding them.''
   Ms. Leigh's suit filed last month claims Hefner reneged on
promises to marry her, father her child and support her.
   Hefner's attorney, Anthony Glassman, said he filed two legal
actions Wednesday in Superior Court.
   One was an answer to Ms. Leigh's palimony suit in which the
founder of Playboy magazine denied his former girlfriend's
allegations.
   The second was the cross complaint seeking $1 million plus court
costs, attorney fees and an amount of punitive damages to be
determined by the court.
   Glassman said the $1 million represents the value of cash,
jewelry, furs and other gifts Hefner gave to Ms. Leigh, now 24,
while the two were together from April 1983 to January.
   Hefner's complaint also accuses Ms. Leigh of fraudulently
telling Hefner she loved him and was faithful to him.
   ``On repeated occasions, Ms. Leigh was sexually unfaithful to
him,'' Glassman told reporters.
   Hefner said he bears no animosity toward Ms. Leigh, but believes
now that she had planned for years to eventually sue him for
palimony.
   ``I think what is happening now is something that was in her
mind from the beginning,'' he said.
   He added that friends, relatives and business associates tried
to warn him about her but he didn't listen to them.
   ``I just saw what I wanted to see,'' he said.
   Hefner, meanwhile, said he has not asked Ms. Conrad to sign any
legal papers absolving him of financial responsibility should their
relationship eventually disolve.
   He said he met the tall, blonde model, Playboy magazine's
January Playmate of the month, when she came to the mansion last
May to pose. He said the two didn't become involved until after Ms.
Leigh left the mansion.
   Ms. Conrad declined comment on Ms. Leigh.
   ``I'm just here to support Hef, and I came after Carrie Leigh,
so I really have no comment,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Anti-apartheid banners adorn the
halls at the University of the Western Cape, and the main plaza is
called Freedom Square. An exile once jailed for terrorism is
receiving an honorary degree this week.
   Western Cape is the most radical university in South Africa. Its
chief administrator, Professor Jakes Gerwel, said when installed as
rector last year that he plans to preside over ``an intellectual
home for the left.''
   The militance of students and staff contrasts sharply with the
government's intent in 1960, when it established a college near
Cape Town for mixed-race students as part of its segregated
education system. J.G. Miering, a white professor who headed the
school in the 1960s, said, ``The white guardian was obliged to
provide these facilities for his colored (mixed-race) ward.''
   The university remains predominantly mixed-race, but Gerwel is
determined to increase black enrollment beyond the current 13
percent. His administration is openly committed to preparing
students for a post-apartheid South Africa led by the now-voteless
black majority.
   ``We are a political thorn in their sides,'' Gerwel said of the
government. ``The establishment doesn't know how to deal with us.''
   A case in point is the university's decision to award an
honorary degree Friday to Breyten Breytenbach, a white poet who
left South Africa in 1982 after serving seven years in prison for
terrorism. The government denied Breytenbach a visa, and a relative
is to accept the award on his behalf.
   At the same graduation ceremony, one of the main speakers will
be Cyril Ramaphosa, general secretary of the militant black
National Union of Mineworkers.
   Last month, the university's governing council elected Anglican
Archbishop Desmond Tutu as chancellor. Tutu, winner of the 1984
Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-apartheid campaigning, is the first
black chosen for the honorary post.
   Gerwel, who as professor of Afrikaans literature was a leading
faculty activist, is the second mixed-race rector. The first,
Richard van der Ross, led from 1975-87 and is credited with
establishing the school's anti-apartheid orientation.
   Most of South Africa's 3 million mixed-race people live in the
Cape Town region. The university's enrollment has soared from 6,128
in 1984 to 11,500 this year, and multiple construction projects
can't keep pace with the need for more facilities.
   ``Sometimes we cannot teach our students because there's no
place to put them,'' said Owen van den Bergh, a white who is dean
of education. ``We have to hope they don't come to class.''
   The government has cut subsidies to all universities by about 25
percent this year and adopted regulations to allow further cuts at
schools that fail to curb campus protest. The University of the
Western Cape and the predominantly white University of Cape Town
successfully challenged the regulations in court, but Gerwel
expects the government to try other tactics to tame his school.
   One of Gerwel's priorities is to expand the university's ties
with the anti-apartheid movement. The campus often serves as a
venue for meetings of militant organizations.
   ``Going to UWC is considered by students to be part of the
political struggle,'' said Di Bishop, vice president of the Black
Sash civil rights organization and a university sociology
researcher. ``You're not going off to an ivory tower for a couple
of years.''
   Security forces have entered the campus several times in recent
years to break up protests with tear gas and whips. There is
animosity among some students toward remaining conservative
professors.
   There also is conflict over language. Some of the 600 teachers
lecture in English and others in Afrikaans, the language that many
mixed-race people have inherited from the mainly Dutch-descended
whites who run the government.
   Van den Bergh forsees increasing tension as black enrollment
rises. He also sees internal pressures building up in individual
students.
   ``There are a lot who say the right things politically but are
fundamentally conservative,'' he said. ``They are worried about
getting a job, getting a house.''
   Gerwel said the university could ``arm itself'' against
government pressure by adding more professional schools. It now
offers graduate degrees in law, pharmacy and dentistry. But he also
wants the curriculum to accommodate those who have been excluded
from power and privilege.
   ``In a changed South Africa, it's not going to be a First World,
high-tech society,'' he said. ``What is this new South Africa we
are working for? We're trying to find out. The English-language
universities are geared to capitalism. We research alternatives.''
   Although the government provides most of their funds, the
university and the 10 predominantly white universities have almost
total control of curriculum and campus policies. The black
universities are tightly controlled by the government and
cooperative administrators, and student protests at these schools
has been repressed.
   Gerwel said his job ``keeps one awake at night.''
   ``But I wouldn't want to be in any other position. We're at the
cutting edge of adjusting to a black-led society.''

<HEAD>Industrial North Facing Economic Boom, Demographic Bust</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite prospects for an economic boom the
next few years, the Northern industrial states face a creeping
erosion of their political clout and claim on federal dollars: a
demographic bust.
   A study by the Northeast-Midwest Institute, a public policy
group with ties to the region's members of Congress, says the
industrial North is enjoying bigger income gains but has far less
population growth than the Sunbelt.
   The population of the 18 Northern states stretching from
Minnesota to New England will grow by 3.8 percent through the
1990s, only about half the national average, according to the study
titled ``The State of the Region'' and released Wednesday.
   In recent years, the South and West have drawn industries and
jobs from the North. Even though the Northeast's overall economy
has rebounded, the region will not be able to keep up with the
competing areas' population growth, the study said. It estimated
that the population of the West and South will grow 10 percent in
the next decade.
   For the Northeast, the lagging population growth will translate
into fewer representatives in the House and fewer federal dollars
from programs based on the number of people in a state or area, the
study said.
   ``Political influence, from the selection of the president in
the electoral college to appropriation fights in the House of
Representatives, will shift further to the South and West,'' the
study said.
   The Northeast could lose 14 House seats after the 1990 census,
the report said. The region lost 15 seats after the 1980 census,
for a total projected loss in representation of 13 percent in the
1970s and 1980s, the study said.
   The lagging population gains in the Northeast and Midwest result
both from lower birth rates and migration to Southern and Western
states, the study said.
   ``The short-term economic outlook for the entire region is
positive,'' the study said. The Northeast shared in the national
return to prosperity from 1983 to late 1986, with New England
benefiting the most.
   Unemployment has dropped below the national average in parts of
the region, but the Northeast is unlikely to regain many of the 1.3
million manufacturing jobs lost between 1980 and 1986, the study
said. The population that remains, however, is enjoying faster per
capita income growth than that of Southerners and Westerners.
   The South and West for the first time topped the Northeast and
Midwest in manufacturing employment in 1986. The Sunbelt had 9.5
million employees on manufacturing payrolls, compared with 9.4
million in the Northeast and Midwest.
   Other points made by the study were:
   _The Northeast and Midwest invested more in public school
education than did other regions.
   _The trend toward an older population was more evident in the
Northeast and Midwest than in the rest of the country.
   Northeast states covered by the report were: Connecticut,
Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.
   The privately funded Northeast-Midwest Institute was formed in
1977 at the request of members of the House and Senate from the
region. The study also was sponsored by two legislative groups: the
Northeast-Midwest Congressional Coalition and the Northeast-Midwest
Senate Coalition.

<HEAD>Dogs, X-Rays To Screen Travelers For Illegal Plants, Food</HEAD>

   International travelers arriving at some major
U.S. airports this summer will be greeted by Agriculture Department
inspectors operating X-ray machines to see if their baggage harbors
illegal food or plants.
   The X-rays, in addition to sharp-nosed canine sniffers, will be
used to check arrivals at 11 U.S. international airports for
illegal sausages, mangoes and other contraband.
   ``Imported meats can carry exotic diseases that could devastate
American livestock,'' James W. Glosser, head of the department's
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said Wednesday.
``Fruits and vegetable coming into the country can carry pests that
could seriously damage American crops.''
   Agency inspectors have used X-ray equipment in Puerto Rico and
Hawaii for departures for several years, with interceptions of
prohibited agricultural items doubling, he said.
   The new systems for arrivals were recently installed at
international airports in Miami; Honolulu; San Juan, Puerto Rico;
Houston; and Chicago.
   Additional equipment soon will be installed at international
airports in Atlanta; New York; Washington; Boston; Los Angeles; and
San Francisco.
   The USDA agency also is installing large signs at the 11
airports telling travelers that X-rays are being used to check
their baggage.
   ``Although most people willingly declare their agricultural
products, we do come across some intentional violators,'' Glosser
said. ``That's only natural, considering that we encountered an
estimated 43 million air travelers in 1987. Some ignore the
regulations and others are not even aware of them, despite all our
information efforts.''
   Glosser said the agency uses several methods to find smuggled
agricultural items, including trained beagles to sniff out the
errant braunschweiger here, the occasional mango or two there.
   ``Finally, we rely on the deterrent effect of penalties,'' he
said. ``We fine violators $25 to $50, payable on the spot. We
currently collect about $30,000 per month, and we have collected
nearly $1.8 million since 1984. Fines are deposited in the U.S.
Treasury.''
   Glosser said the travel industry plays an important role in
helping educate the traveling public, including the distribution of
booklets about agricultural items that may be brought into the
United States.
   A brochure also can be obtained by writing: Travelers Tips,
USDA-APHIS, G-187 Federal Building, Hyattsville, Md. 20782.

   An absorbent called super slurper invented in
the 1970s is helping tiny worms kill destructive root weevils that
threaten citrus trees, according to an Agriculture Department
scientist.
   William J. Schroeder, an entomolgist in the department's
Agricultural Research Service, said Wednesday the super slurper
keeps soil moist so that the microscopic worms, or nematodes, can
survive and kill weevils that chew the tree roots.
   In tests, 60 percent of the weevils were killed, compared with
only 25 percent without the help of the worms. Schroeder said that
weevils can kill up to 30 percent of the trees in a grove if not
controlled.
   The nematodes haven't been used before as a natural weevil
control because they die quickly if soil dries out, Schroeder said.
   Other agency scientists are looking into the use of super
slurper and nematodes to see if they can control pests of corn and
vegetables.
   Agency scientists in Peoria, Ill., invented the cornstarch-based
super slurper 14 years ago. It has been successfully used in dozens
of commercial products, including body powder, medical dressings
and many other items.
   Schroeder, who works at the department's horticultural research
laboratory in Orlando, Fla., said he thought of super slurper in
1985 when he observed nematodes dying in dry soil.
   ``I realized that in order to use this biological control
(nematodes), we would have to keep the soil moist,'' Schroeder said.
   With its ability to hold up to 2,000 times its own weight in
water, superslurper provided the answer, Schroeder said..
   Companies could mass-rear nematodes and ``package billions of
them alive'' for sale to growers, who then could mix the worms with
super slurper for application on tree roots before planting, he
said.
   For citrus groves already inhabited by the beneficial nematodes,
Schroeder said he is looking into the possibility of injecting
super slurper into the soil with a nozzle.
   The tiny worms, which survive as long as the soil is kept moist,
penetrate the weevils and release lethal bacteria, which don't harm
plants or other organisms, Schroeder said.

<TEXT>
   A man accused of trying to sexually
assault Miss USA pageant co-host Tracy Scoggins contends she
invited him to her room, a claim the actress dismissed as absurd.
   ``Tracy Scoggins has turned some very serious charges into a
very cheap publicity stunt in a desperate attempt to benefit her
sagging career,'' said attorney Jose Montes Jr., who is
representing the man.
   Montes said Tuesday that Miss Scoggins met his client, Pedro
Concepcion Padilla, in traffic on Interstate 10 on Feb. 25 and
invited him to her hotel room. Montes declined to elaborate on the
highway encounter.
   The actress, best known for her role as Monica Colby in TV's
prime-time soap opera ``The Colbys,'' told police Padilla attacked
her that day in a hotel elevator.
   Padilla was arrested and gave police and a judge a false name
and address, authorities said. After posting $100 bail, he was
rearrested, and then released on $100,000 bail.
   Miss Scoggins, who was here for the pageant, described the
attack at a news conference on Feb. 26, and a first-person account
with her byline is in the latest edition of the National Enquirer.
   Miss Scoggins, in a statement released Tuesday by her publicist,
said she had never seen Padilla until he got on the elevator.
   ``The allegations made by Mr. Padilla's attorney are so
blatantly absurd they should not be dignified by comment. But I do
want to say, though, that it's a pity a woman has to be a victim
twice,'' she said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Reagan Discovers Deficits Aren't So Bad After All</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leave it to Ronald Reagan to find something
good to say about budget deficits.
   For decades, Reagan has denounced the big-spending crowd in
Washington that he said was dooming future generations to a life of
debt and penury.
   In his seven years in office, he has promised repeatedly to do
something about it and blamed Democrats in Congress for the
deficits that nevertheless flourished.
   In a recent interview with Lou Cannon of The Washington Post,
however, Reagan was reminded of the sizable deficit he will leave
behind, and was asked:
   ``Do you think that this is going to have a negative consequence
on the next generations? Is this going to be a real burden for the
country?''
   Reagan's reply:
   ``It's a burden. There's no question about that. But ... not the
disaster some people proclaim. ... one of the major factors in our
budget right now is the interest. But who gets that interest? And
you find out then that a great many institutions, universities,
educational institutions of all kinds, that part of their endowment
are government bonds. And so a lot of that interest is going to
them ... (and) to individual Americans ...(as) part of their
savings, instead of putting it in the bank or something.
   ``So, instead of it being something that's just disappearing
down a rat hole, it's a kind of a redistribution ... of national
wealth in that these institutions and so forth are getting this
interest from the government. Now maybe some of them would have to
be getting straight grants from the government if they were not
getting that interest. So, no, I don't think it's a disaster.''
   Reagan, still saying that he was ``disappointed that we haven't
been able to do better'' and that ``the Congress added to that
budget,'' conceded that his position was ``really a reversal of
roles'' for him.
   It sure is.
   As the president noted: ``Way back before I ever thought I would
be governor, when I was just out making speeches on the
mashed-potato circuit about things that I thought should be changed
... I was complaining about the fact that, for almost 60 years now,
with only eight single-year exceptions, this country has been
running a deficit.''
   It still is running a deficit, but now Reagan calls it a
redistribution of wealth.
   As the president would say, it reminds one of a story. In fact,
one of Reagan's favorite stories.
   The story is about two boys, one a pessimist and one an
optimist, who are taken to a psychiatrist. He puts the pessimist in
a room full of shiny new toys and finds him crying because he's
afraid the toys might break. The optimistic child is put in a room
with piles of horse manure and is found joyfully exclaiming, ``I
know there's a pony in here someplace.''
   It's the same way with deficits. Ronald Reagan always knew there
was a pony in there someplace.

   A telephone repair crew balked at fixing a
downed wire until their customer agreed to hold the lion.
   ``They wrote on their work report, `Lion in yard. No way,'''
said Dannie Carper, 51, an Indiana Bell supervisor from South Bend
who helped Indianapolis clean up from an early March ice storm that
roared in like a you-know-what.
   Carper verified on Monday that the householder owned a year-old
lioness named Chasta. The owner agreed to leash her so that Carper
could reattach the wire. ``It was just a big old 225-pound puddy
tat,'' he said.
   Carper had his picture taken with Chasta. ``I have one where
I've got my arms around her and she's chewing on my shoe,'' he
said. ``I wasn't scared. But when she was chewing on my shoes I was
afraid maybe she thought they were pigskin.''
   Chasta has found a new home on a farm in suburban Noblesville.

<HEAD>Djilas Says Eastern Europe Moving Toward Greater Independence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man known as the godfather of East
European dissidents says the reforms of Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
the promised Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan are nudging other
Warsaw Pact nations toward greater independence from the Kremlin.
   ``Eastern European nations will insist on trying to find ways
toward greater autonomy from the Soviet Union,'' said Milovan
Djilas, whose native Yugoslavia parted with Moscow in 1948.
   Similar nationalistic impulses also are being expressed in the
non-Russian republics of the Soviet Union, such as Armenia,
Azerbaijan, and the Baltic states, where the Kremlin has been
cracking down on demonstrations.
   In the West, said Djilas, people ``should have hope, but not
illusions, should be strong but not unreasonable'' in reacting to
Gorbachev's foreign and domestic policy initiatives.
   Djilas, now 77, began his dissidence in 1953, a year later quit
his posts as Yugoslavian vice president and member of the Communist
Party Politburo, and was imprisoned from 1956-61 by Yugoslavia's
then-president, Josef Broz Tito.
   From prison, he wrote his best known work, ``The New Class,'' in
which he argued that communist leaders in the Soviet Union and
throughout Eastern Europe had created a system in which power,
wealth and privilege were as abused as in the governments they
replaced. His writings made him an icon in the West, and became a
model for dissidents throughout the Communist world.
   Djilas, who addressed the Heritage Foundation last week and
later was interviewed by The Associated Press, last visited the
United States in 1968. The government of Yugoslavia took away his
passport in 1970 and did not restore it until 18 months ago.
   ``I am not a good boy,'' he said, grinning impishly despite his
advanced age and a nagging heart condition. The Yugoslavian
government, he said ``is not very happy about my speaking'' but
apparently has given up its futile efforts to silence him.
   Western attention to his predicament made life easier, he said.
   ``I think the West and America saved me,'' he said. ``Certainly,
my fate would have been much worse if public opinion had not been
aroused on my behalf.''
   Djilas had warm words for Gorbachev, whose reforms he said were
an attempt to end the repressive system imposed on the Soviet Union
and Eastern Europe by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.
   Even if Kremlin conservatives topple Gorbachev, Djilas
predicted, the process will continue.
   ``Gorbachev is a man in the middle of the party, between the
hardliners and more radical elements like (Boris) Yeltsin,'' who
was forced to quit his post as the Communist Party first secretary
for the city of Moscow because he criticized Gorbachev for going
too slow.
   The reforms and the promised ``Soviet withdrawal from
Afghanistan will strengthen democratic elements in the Soviet
Union'' and encourage other Warsaw Pact nations in their own
economic and political experiments, said Djilas.
   East European leaders are trying to avoid a confrontation with
Moscow while seeking greater independence, he said. ``There is no
sign of an uprising.''
   ``Yugoslavia is farthest along in this crisis of communism,''
retaining a communist government while allowing market forces to
play a powerful role in the economy, he said.
   The crisis is also acute in Poland, where the army stepped in to
preserve communist rule in 1981, and where the economy is mixed
between state and private ownership, said Djilas.
   ``We cannot exclude that Poland would develop a different
(non-communist) social system, and still remain within the Warsaw
Pact'' and thus pose no military threat to the Kremlin, said Djilas.

<TEXT>
   World experts on children's health are gathered in
a French alpine town to review an immunization project that has
been saving millions of young lives and to plan ways of helping
more.
   ``Anyone who is anyone in international aid will be at this
meeting,'' said Dr. Ken Warren of the Rockefeller Foundation.
``People want to come because this is a group that is actually
doing something and not just talking.''
   The three-day meeting in Talloires, France, opens today.
   Among those expected to attend are Dr. Jonas Salk, discoverer of
the polio Salk vaccine; Barber Conable, president of the World
Bank; James P. Grant, the UNICEF executive director; former World
Bank President Robert McNamara, and Joshua Cohen, director of the
World Health Organization.
   They will join leaders of other international aid agencies,
physicians and health ministers from at least 13 countries.
   The symposium is sponsored by the Task Force for Child Survival,
whose members are the United Nations Children's Fund, WHO, the
World Bank, the United Nations Development Program and the
Rockefeller Foundation.
   These organizations have been working together since the early
1980s on an international campaign to immunize children against
polio, diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus. The project, aimed
particularly at developing countries, has been a stunning success.
   The percentage of children vaccinated against the five deadly
diseases has risen from 5 percent in 1974 to 50 percent today.
Experts predict that by the early 1990s, nearly every child in the
world will be immunized.
   ``In a little over a decade a public health revolution has
quietly taken place,'' said Dr. Ralph H. Henderson, director of
WHO's expanded program on immunization.
   Henderson said the vaccination campaign against measles,
neonatal tetunus and whooping cough is saving the lives of more
than a million children each year in the developing world. Another
200,000 children are being saved from the paralysis of polio, he
said.
   Warren, in a telephone interview from London, called the project
``the single most remarkable example of international interagency
cooperation I've ever seen.''
   One of the 11 papers to be reviewed at the meeting deals with
the anticipated eradication of polio from the Americas y 1990.
   ``If this effort is successful, it may be possible to launch a
global polio eradication campaign early in the 1990s,'' said
Henderson. ``A world without polio would be a fitting gift from the
20th to the 21st century.''
   The participants also will discuss controlling diarrheal
diseases, caring for pregnant women and providing low-cost vaccines
to impoverished nations.
   Dr. William Foege, executive director of the Task Force and
former director of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, will
open the meeting with background for discussions on population
control.
   Health ministers or their representatives are expected from
China, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Nigeria, Pakistan, Mexico, Egypt,
Senegal, Colombia, Morocco, Peru and Uganda. Together, the
countries account for well over half the world's children.
   Representatives of donor agencies will represent the United
States, Japan, Switzerland, France, West Germany, Britain, Canada,
Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland.

<HEAD>NRC Fines Utility's North Anna Nuclear Power Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has fined
the owner of the North Anna nuclear power plant $100,000 after
operators failed to respond promptly to a equipment malfunction,
officials said Wednesday.
   Monitoring instruments on two pipes carrying steam to the
plant's generators malfunctioned, and operators did not respond for
about 10 hours, according to the NRC, which imposed the penalty
against Virginia Power Co.
   Under NRC rules, operators must take action within an hour.
   The incident, which occurred Nov. 4 when the utility was
restarting North Anna Unit 2 after refueling, caused no injuries or
release of radiation.
   The NRC said that the violation, involving part of a non-nuclear
system, did not pose a direct safety hazard.
   However, the instruments provide information necessary to
reactor safety, and if steam is not moving correctly to generators,
the nuclear systems could overheat, utility and NRC officials said.
   The instruments could also be used in responding to steam-line
ruptures. In 1986, at Virginia Power's Surry nuclear plnat, four
workers were killed by scalding steam and water from a failed pipe.
   The commission said because similar incidents occurred
previously at North Anna, the fine was doubled from $50,000, the
typical amount for such violations.
   The utility said it would not contest the fine and it disputed
only the NRC's contention that previous violations were similar.
   Virginia Power has taken action to ensure a violation will not
happen again, including improved training of operators, said
utility spokesman James E. McDonald Jr. No workers were dismissed
or disciplined, he said.
   The North Anna nuclear unit has three main steam lines, and each
has two of the instruments. In the November incident, one
instrument failed on each of two lines.
   McDonald said operators initially were unaware the instruments
were malfunctioning.
   Virginia Power has been fined 13 times since it began operating
nuclear plants in 1972.

   For a brief moment, President Reagan was
transported back in time _ hurling a pigskin to a wide receiver at
a sentimental celebration of Notre Dame's Knute Rockne and his own
days as a Hollywood star.
   ``The Gipper'' returned to the Notre Dame campus Wednesday to
pay tribute to the late football legend and dedicate a 22-cent
stamp issued in honor of the coach's 100th birthday.
   It was a nostalgic trip into the past for Ronald Reagan, the
one-time actor, sports announcer and college football player who
clearly reveled in the crowd's friendly applause.
   The Notre Dame gathering of students and faculty _ including
many wearing Roman collars _ roared approval as they were treated
to clips from Reagan's 1940 film portrayal of Notre Dame football
star George Gipp in ``Knute Rockne: All American.''
   The film showed the fresh-faced Reagan, playing Gipp, as he
playfully kicked footballs high above the playing field while Pat
O'Brien, playing Rockne, persuades him to join the team.
   Another clip showed O'Brien, as Rockne, giving a pep talk to his
players at halftime of a 1928 game against Army, with both sides
scoreless. Gipp had died eight years earlier, but the coach tells
his charges that on his deathbed the young athlete said, ``Some
time when the team is up against it and the breaks are beating the
boys, tell them to go out there with all they got and win just one
for the Gipper.''
   Army went ahead in the third quarter, 6-0, but Notre Dame went
on to win the game, 12-6. Army was one yard from the tying
touchdown as time ran out.
   Reagan's supporters adopted the ``Win one'' phrase during his
presidency to help garner support for his programs. And the
nickname ``the Gipper'' has since stuck.
   At the end of his speech, the filled-to-capacity crowd was
silent as Reagan tried to repeat the lines from Gipp's deathbed
scene. Few, however, noticed that Reagan flubbed the line and
instead of saying ``Gipper,'' actually pronounced it ``Gippet,''
since his listeners erupted in a joyful cheer at the sentimental
moment.
   Handed a football, Reagan hurled it towards members of the Notre
Dame football team seated strategically near the podium.
   Aiming at one young man who held his arms high, Reagan heaved
the pigskin _ directly, it turned out, at Heisman trophy winner Tim
Brown. Again, the crowd roared approval.
   Reagan had told his audience that the role of Gipp ``was a young
actor's dream'' but that playing in a film about Rockne ``was more
than that'' to him.
   ``I know that, to many of you today, Rockne is a revered name, a
symbol of greatness and, yes, a face on a postage stamp,'' he said.
   ``But my generation, well, we actually knew the legend as it
happened _ we saw it unfold. And we felt it was saying something
important about us as a people and a nation,'' the 77-year-old
president said.
   ``Most of all, the Rockne legend meant this: ... that on or off
the field, it is faith that makes the difference, it is faith that
makes great things happen.''
   Rockne, a graduate of the Roman Catholic college, was its head
football coach from 1918 to 1931. He compiled a record of 108
victories, 12 losses and five ties. During his tenure, the Fighting
Irish were undefeated in five seasons and won six national
championships.
   The White House has worked for years to produce picture-perfect
events to frame the president as the nation's leader _ but few
could have been as nostalgic.
   ``He loved it,'' said Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, a 1940
Notre Dame graduate who traveled with Reagan aboard Air Force One.
   The Cabinet secretary said Reagan particularly enjoyed tossing
the football.
   ``The president threw a perfect strike,'' Lyng added with a
laugh.

   An autopsy determined that heart disease
caused the death of Divine, the 375-pound female impersonator who
starred in the cult film classic ``Pink Flamingos,'' the coroner's
office says.
   ``There was no evidence of drugs or alcohol. He died in his
sleep of an enlarged heart, probably due to the obesity,'' Steve
Stewart, a Los Angeles County coroner's spokesman, said Wednesday
   The cause of death was listed as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or
enlarged heart, Stewart said. The coroner's report showed that
Divine, whose real name was Harris Glenn Milstead, weighed 375
pounds.
   The 42-year-old actor, who appears in the current release

<HEAD>Odds Increasing for Brokered Presidential Convention</HEAD>

   The Democratic Party's losing presidential
candidates have found one bright spot in the darkness of their
defeat: The odds are that nobody will be able to claim victory by
the time the primaries are over in June.
   The big winners in this week's round of primaries and caucuses
dismiss that as wishful thinking.
   ``If you get within a decent distance, you're not going to be
stopped,'' said Rick Hutcheson, who oversees delegate selection for
Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr.'s campaign. ``I don't think there's
any doubt in the world that there are plenty of delegates out there
for a first-ballot nominee to develop.''
   True, there are enough delegates yet to be allotted that a clear
winner could emerge. But the odds certainly are growing longer that
any candidate can come up with the magic number needed to win on
the first ballot at the Democratic convention in Atlanta.
   ``Mathematically and politically this process is in gridlock,''
said Terry Michael, spokesman for Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, who
suffered a shutout in Tuesday's round of primaries and caucuses.
   Hutcheson, who worked in former President Jimmy Carter's 1976
presidential campaign, said the then-candidate Carter wound up the
primary season with about 85 percent of the delegates he needed to
win the Democratic presidential nomination. The remaining delegates
gravitated toward a winner, he said.
   ``I think that same scenario will develop here,'' Hutcheson said.
   Simon, who held just 35.5 delegates both before and after
Tuesday's balloting, is banking on nobody being able to gain the
2,082 delegates needed to win the Democratic presidential
nomination when the primaries conclude on June 7, with California
and New Jersey, two of the largest states with a total of 423
delegates at stake.
   ``The person or persons with the greatest potential to negotiate
his way to a first-ballot victory will be the candidate who is
hottest at the end,'' Michael said.
   The Democrats have yet to allocate 2,524 of their national
convention delegates, and another 258.65 delegates list themselves
as uncommitted. Thus the available pool of delegates to be won
between now and early June would be 2,782.65. Partial figures
result from party rules that divide up some votes at the convention.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, who was leading the field of
Democratic candidates with 456.5 delegates, needs to win another
1,625.5 to wrap up the presidential nomination. Or, put another
way, he has to win more than 58 percent of all the delegates that
are still left to be won _ roughly twice as well as he's done so
far.
   Dukakis was followed in the delegate count by Jesse Jackson with
395.55 and Gore with 346.8.
   The virtual three-way tie prompted Carter to observe that ``I
think it's accurate to say the chances are less likely that one of
the candidates will arrive in Atlanta with a clear majority.''
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, a non-candidate who nonetheless has
said he would consider stepping into the void at a deadlocked
convention, still says he wants to see his party hold a ``quiet
convention.'' But he concedes that it will be difficult for any of
the current candidates to secure a first-ballot victory based on
results of the primaries and caucuses.
   Michael said if no candidate holds a majority by the time the
primaries conclude, the rule of conscience that binds delegates to
the candidates will begin to bend and break.
   But Susan Brophy, an aide to Dukakis, called that assertion
``ridiculous.''
   ``These people get into the process because they believe, A, in
the process and, B, in the candidate _ and not necessarily in that
order.''
   And, Jude Barry, an aide to Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt's
presidential campaign, agreed, saying, ``I think there's going to
be loyalty and commitment. We're prepared to protect what we have,
as I'm sure the other candidates will as well.''
   Gephardt, who had 143 delegates after Super Tuesday, is hoping
to hang on with a strong showing in the Michigan caucuses on March
26 and the congressional Democratic caucuses on April 19 and 20.
Gephardt also expects to win big when his House colleagues pick 210
of their own to be national convention delegates. Another 43
delegates will be picked by Senate Democrats.
   ``Our hand certainly will not be weak with that wild card,''
Barry said.
   Simon, meanwhile, is hoping to score a victory next Tuesday in
his home state of Illinois.

   Texas on Wednesday sued to bar
shipments of Florida citrus in an attempt to protect its fruit
crops from citrus canker.
   U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela on Wednesday denied the state's
request for an emergency stay of a federal order Feb. 11 lifting a
3-year ban on shipments of fresh Florida citrus into Texas and
other citrus-producing areas.
   Vela scheduled a hearing for Monday on the suit, which accuses
the U.S. Agriculture Department of lifting the quarantine without
giving proper notice and an opportunity for a public hearing.
   Florida citrus was quarantined after an outbreak of citrus
canker in Florida in 1984. The bacterial disease can cause
defoliation, lesions that render the fruit unmarketable and
premature dropping of the fruit from the tree.
   On Feb. 15, four days after the quarantine was lifted, Texas
imposed an emergency 30-day ban on Florida citrus, but a federal
court in Austin on overturned the ban, ruling that federal action
takes precedence over state.
   Paul Martin, director of pest management for the Texas
Department of Agriculture, said Texas at least would like to keep
Florida fruit out of the lower Rio Grande Valley, where the state's
$65 million citrus industry is concentrated.
   ``The issue is, we're dealing with a real serious disease in
this case that is a threat to the industry,'' he said.
   Florida producers maintain that the canker presents a minimal
threat to the Texas citrus industry, and some growers there sued to
stop the Texas quarantine.

<HEAD>Business Lobby Opposing Clean Air Legislation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major business lobbying group is trying to
keep Congress from passing new nationwide clean air legislation,
claiming it will cost too much, reduce jobs and increase the trade
deficit.
   David M. Roderick, chairman of the environment committee of the
Business Roundtable, said Wednesday that any legislation should be
targeted only at areas with dirty air.
   However, he did not offer specific suggestions for such regional
measures, and said the decisions should be left to the
Environmental Protection Agency.
   Roderick commented as the business group released a report
claiming that clean air legislation passed by the Senate
Environment and Public Works Committee earlier this year would cost
the economy between $15 billion and $73 billion. It said the most
likely figure is $32 billion, and also claimed that the measure
would eliminate between 300,000 and 600,000 manufacturing jobs.
   Roderick, who is chairman of USX Corp., complained about acid
rain provisions in the bill. He said the government should wait for
the final report of the National Acid Precipitation Assessment
Program, a 10-year, 12-agency research effort that isn't due for
completion for another 18 months.
   He said complying with the committee-passed bill would cost his
own company's U.S. Steel Corp. subsidiary $1.5 billion to $2
billion.
   ``We would import more semi-finished product,'' worsening the
trade deficit, he said.
   Roderick said the business group also objects to tougher new
controls on toxic chemical and auto emissions.

   A person who buys a round for a drinking
companion may be held liable if the companion gets into an auto
accident, an Oregon appeals court ruled Wednesday.
   The decision involved a suit filed by the Red Steer bar in
Portland against Richard Howard, whose stepson Lonnie D. Johnson
got into a accident in 1982 that injured another man.
   The bar settled with the injured man, James Solberg, for
$425,000 and then sued Howard, who according to the suit
accompanied Johnson to three bars, the two buying drinks for each
other, on the day of the collision.
   Lawyers for the bar claim Howard should be responsible for some
of the damages because he knew or should have known Johnson had a
drinking problem, had been convicted of drunken driving and had
been in accidents while drinking.
   Multnomah County Circuit Judge Lee Johnson dismissed the
lawsuit, finding noi legal basis for it. But the Court of Appeals
on Wednesday reinstated the case.
   The appeals court said Howard could be found to owe damages
under a common law negligence theory that says someone who
``substantially assists or encourages'' negligent conduct by
another can be held liable.
   The decision is believed the first ruling in Oregon to deal with
liability of a drinking companion at a commercial establishment.
   In dismissing the lawsuit, the lower court judge said it would
``an unprecedented and unwarranted extension of common law
liability to hold that Howard had a legal duty ... to Solberg.''

   When a nurse in a hospital waiting room
called the name Gnau, two cousins who hadn't seen each other in 60
years stood up.
   ``I looked at him and asked him his name,'' said 73-year-old
Elmer Gnau, a retired tool and dye maker. ``I knew if he said
Kenneth, he would be my cousin. Not many people are named Gnau.''
   Tuesday's chance meeting was an emotional experience for the two
soft-spoken men, who last saw each other when they were children in
Louisville, Ky. Elmer was 13 and Kenneth 3.
   ``I never thought I would have recognized him,'' said Kenneth
Gnau, 63. ``But I looked up, and my stomach came right up to my
throat. He has the face of my father. I almost cried.''
   Elmer Gnau, who lives in La Grange, Ky., said he was in Florida
to visit his son, Jerry Gnau, in North Lauderdale when the
after-effects of a bout with pneumonia sent him to the hospital.
   Kenneth Gnau, who retired to Margate with his wife, was waiting
for an X-ray of a shoulder injury.
   The cousins, whose fathers were brothers, planned to visit each
other later this week after Kenneth Gnau has shoulder surgery.

<HEAD>Super Tuesday Shows Labor Yet To Pick Its Candidate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union members in the South have given the
heave-ho to one of the two Democratic presidential candidates who
courted them most actively and sent a strong signal to their once
reluctant leaders to play ball with the other.
   Jesse Jackson, shunned by the AFL-CI0 in 1984 in its failed
effort to help put Walter Mondale in the White House, received a 37
percent plurality of votes from union households in 12 Southern
Super Tuesday primaries, according to ABC-TV exit polls.
   Only 10 percent of union voters in the same primaries cast
ballots for Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, point man the past
three years for organized labor's top priority in Congress _
retaliatory trade legislation.
   With Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Sen. Albert Gore of
Tennessee equally sharing the other half of the union vote Tuesday,
the AFL-CIO is no closer to making a Democratic presidential
endorsement than it was a year ago.
   Unlike 1984 when Mondale's challengers pinned a ``special
interest'' tag on labor after its early endorsement of him, union
leaders have proclaimed all of the still viable Democratic
candidates this year as acceptable to them.
   Consequently on Tuesday there were none of the union volunteers
and phone banks brought into action in the Southern primaries four
years ago to stop then-Sen. Gary Hart's threat of taking the
nomination away from Mondale.
   Also absent Tuesday was union rank-and-file worker turnout. Only
5 percent of those voting in the Democratic Southern primaries came
from union households, according to the exit polls.
   ``We have a problem of labor being with everyone, so nobody is
doing anything,'' said Joan Baggett, political director of the
Bricklayers Union who took her vacation the past three weeks to
work as a volunteer for Dukakis in the South.
   ``The up side is we haven't alienated any of our members by
endorsing,'' she said. ``The down side is that we haven't excited
them either. We're just not getting people to the polls.''
   Jackson's strong showing among those union members who did vote
Tuesday indicates he may be the exception. While blacks compose 14
percent of the U.S. population, they represent a larger 20 percent
share of 19 million unionized workers nationwide and an even
greater proportion in the South.
   Still, for Jackson to get 37 percent of the union vote, some of
the support had to come from white workers, whose cause Jackson has
championed on hundreds of picket lines over the past four years.
   ``He's been out there on the lines and in the strikes every time
labor has called on him and this is a healthy response to that,''
said Jerry Clark, political director for 1.1-million-member
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
   Loretta Bowen, who holds the same title for the Communications
Workers of America, said white members of her union were slated as
Jackson delegates in the South and have expressed a keen interest
in him in New York as well.
   ``As a spokesman for the gut issues that affect organized labor,
he's articulating them better than any of the candidates,'' she
said. ``And the fact there has been no endorsement has helped him a
lot.''
   But Ms. Bowen, who personally favors Dukakis, and other labor
political activists believe Jackson's plurality of support will
fade as the primaries move next week to Illinois and then on to
other rust belt states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio, where
unions are much stronger.
   ``The buzzword already is electibility, and I've never seen that
kind of November strategy ever emerge this early before in our
union,'' she said.
   Allen Zack of the United Food and Commerical Workers union,
noting Gore's increased use of TV spots emphasizing his pro-worker
record in Congress, said all of the Democratic candidates are now
going after the labor vote.
   ``Jesse's talking their language better,'' Zack said. ``He's not
trying to tell some laid off steel worker in Alabama about some
high-tech job in the future. He's talking about restoring their
standard of living today.''
   For that reason, Zack said he was surprised that Gephardt with
his emphasis on slashing trade imbalances through retaliatory
quotas against foreigners who restrict their imports of U.S. goods
got no better than 10 percent of the union vote Tuesday.
   ``Of course he didn't have the money to get on the air as
much,'' Zack said of Gephardt. ``If Super Tuesday confirms
anything, it's the power of TV advertising. It's quite obvious from
the turnout and the results that a parade hasn't formed yet for
labor leaders to rush out in front of.''
   Officials for the AFL-CIO said members of its affiliated unions
running on delegate slates for Jackson, Dukakis and Gore all won
seats Tuesday at the Democratic National Convention in July after
failing to get a single delegate in New Hampshire's primary three
weeks ago.
   ``We didn't do much with Gephardt because Gephardt didn't do
much,'' said Rex Hardesty, a spokesman for the federation.
   Keith Geiger, a vice president of the National Education
Assocation, the nation's largest union with more than 1.7 million
members and not a part of the AFL-CIO, said it also won convention
delegate seats for each of the three Democratic front-runners
Tuesday.

   There's been a coup and rumors of strife on the
set of a Broadway-bound production of ``Macbeth'' starring Glenda
Jackson and Christopher Plummer, but it wasn't in Shakespeare's
script.
   The original director, Kenneth Frankel, was dismissed five weeks
before the tragedy's arrival in New York for a 12-week run. In
addition, new sets and costumes were made at a cost of $250,000.
   The new director, Robin Phillips of Canada's Stratford Festival,
agreed to rescue the production but doesn't want his name on the
program.
   The rumors of strife involve the stars, although they appeared
amiable on arrival here Tuesday for 16 performances at the O'Keefe
Center, where $1 million in advance sales set a box office record.
   Miss Jackson, who is working with Plummer for the first time,
repeated her old saw that it's not necessary to like fellow actors
in order to put on a play.
   Asked if he had done anything to make his co-star dislike him,
Plummer smiled and said, ``I constantly do.''
   She chimed in, ``This is true.''

   Former Gov. Charles Robb was among the

wasn't even running for anything.
   Robb, one of the architects of the multistate primary election,
said he was knocked out Tuesday night when he walked into a closed
glass door while trying to leave his Washington office as he talked
to a television cameraman.
   ``I haven't had a sensation like that since the last time I
played in a football game,'' said the Democrat.
   The door, which is normally open, did not break.
   Robb said he ``blacked out for a few moments'' but did not
require medical attention. Minutes later, he cut short an
appearance on Cable News Network. ``I couldn't remember why I was
there for a few minutes,'' he said. ``Finally, I said on the air
that I wouldn't be doing the viewers a service by continuing.''
   Robb said he talked to other news organizations throughout the
night, but asked that interviews be kept brief.
   ``People kept trying to get me to go to the hospital, but I was
hard-headed,'' he said.

same time, he feels Charlotte is a growing city and a growing
marketplace.''
   The new stores will sell an upscale line of clothing and
accessories called the Alexander Julian Collection. ``We've
expanded our men's collection,'' Miguel said. ``We have more
sportswear now than previously.''
   Although, Julian, the 39-year-old son of a Chapel Hill
haberdasher, lives just outside New York in Greenwich, Conn., he
makes no secret of his love for North Carolina.
   He's designing uniforms for the Charlotte Hornets, a new

<HEAD>Married, Insured People Get More Lung Cancer Treatment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Non-medical factors like patients' insurance
coverage and marital status may influence how aggressively they are
treated for lung cancer, a study of more than 1,800 cases suggests.
   The research raises the possibility that doctors may be
influenced by more than simply patients' medical needs in deciding
how to treat them.
   However, more treatment may not always mean better care. The
study found that people who received surgery, radiation or
chemotherapy for lung cancer lived no longer than those who do not,
``suggesting that the additional treatment was given largely to
those who had little or nothing to gain from it.''
   Other experts cautioned that discrimination against the unwed
and uninsured are not the only possible explanations for the
study's findings.
   The study published in today's New England Journal of Medicine
was written by Dr. E. Robert Greenberg and other doctors from
Dartmouth and the University of Vermont.
   It was based on 1,808 lung cancer cases, virtually all of those
reported in New Hampshire and Vermont between 1973 and 1976.
   Treating lung cancer is often futile. Surgery offers the only
chance of cure, but in most patients the disease has spread too far
for it to help. Radiation and sometimes chemotherapy may be used to
ease symptoms.
   The study found that cancer patients were more likely to undergo
surgery if they were married or had private medical insurance.
Those who didn't get surgery were more likely to receive radiation
or drug therapy if they had insurance.
   ``Some doctors may be disquieted to learn that potentially
curative or palliative (symptom-relieving) treatments were not
provided to patients who seemed less able to pay or who lacked a
spouse,'' the researchers wrote. ``Our findings do suggest that the
presence of inequities in the medical care of poor and socially
isolated patients with lung cancer.''
   However, in an accompanying editorial, Drs. Robert J. Mayer and
W. Bradford Patterson of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston
said there are other possible explanations.
   For instance, they raised the possibility that married people
might seek medical attention earlier, when their disease is more
treatable, because their spouses are sensitive to symptoms that
otherwise might have been ignored. And instead of assuming that the
poor get too little treatment, it's possible that those with
insurance get too much, simply because they are able to pay.
   Mayer and Bradford wrote that it would be ``clearly
undesirable'' for such factors as insurance coverage to influence
medical treatment.
   They added, ``It would be premature and potentially dangerous,
however, to conclude that worrisome factors such as these do
contribute substantially to the decision-making process,'' based on
review of doctors' handling a kind of cancer that cannot be
effectively treated.

   Jesse Jackson collected 2.5 million votes on
Super Tuesday, more than any other Democrat and enough to cause a
re-examination of the conventional wisdom that a black cannot be
nominated for president in the America of 1988.
   ``If Jackson were white, I think he'd be president,'' says
Howard University political science professor Ronald Walters, who
was Jackson's deputy campaign manager in 1984 and is the author of
a new book, ``Black Presidential Politics in America.''
   ``If he were white, he wouldn't be in the race,'' says Ben J.
Wattenberg, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and
co-editor of Public Opinion magazine.
   Walters says Jackson's experience in the civil rights movement
is more than the equivalent to service in legislative halls. And he
cites Jackson's electrifying quality.
   ``Charisma _ say what you will, it still counts in politics,''
he says. ``Just ask Ronald Reagan.''
   Wattenberg, on the other hand, contends that a black could be
elected president in the America of 1988, but not one with
Jackson's lack of experience holding public office nor his
controversial record.
   ``Jesse Jackson went to Cuba and said, `Viva Che Guevara,'
praising a man who dedicated his life to the export of communism to
South and Latin America,'' Wattenberg said. ``Had any other
politician in American life ever said anything like that, he might
have been scandalized and drummed out of the race.''
   The question of Jackson's electability takes new relevance in
light of his Super Tuesday showing. Network polls said Jackson won
between 8 and 10 percent of the white vote in the South, twice as
much as four years ago.
   Forty-four percent of Republican voters and 29 percent of
Democratic voters polled by ABC News in a dozen Southern states
said they would not vote for Jackson if he were the Democratic
nominee. By comparison, 37 percent of Republican voters and 45
percent of Democrats ruled out a vote for Pat Robertson. Gary Hart
was rejected by 44 percent of Republicans and 35 percent of
Democrats.
   Jackson drew more votes than Michael Dukakis or than Albert Gore
Jr., who boycotted the earlier primaries but nonetheless was
propelled into the ranks of Democratic front-runners on the
strength of his showing Tuesday.
   Lucius Barker, a political science professor at St. Louis'
Washington University who was a Jackson delegate in 1984, said the
he-cannot-win argument is becoming a code for opposition to Jackson
on racial grounds.
   ``It is going to look more and more odd for people to say
that,'' he said. ``If you had a white candidate who had the kind of
support Jackson has, he would be picking up endorsements, he would
have momentum and you would have the next nominee.''
   Jackson acknowledges the existence of a racial barrier to his
winning the nomination. In campaign speeches, he tells the
apocryphal story of two hard-hit farmers in Iowa. One says to the
other he likes Jackson's message and politics, ``but...''
   Declares Jackson: ``I want those people to move from `but' to
`therefore.'''
   Some surveys show 15 to 20 percent of the population would
reject any black on racial grounds.
   ``It is probably higher,'' said Robert Smith, professor of
Afro-American politics at Howard University, who nonetheless
believes the positions Jackson takes are a handicap as substantial
as that of race.
   ``I would say he would not be nominated or elected if he were
white,'' he said. ``A substantial number of white persons who
object to Jackson do so more because of his ideology than his
race.''
   Agreed Al Thornton, Jackson's Maryland issues director: ``It may
just be that any liberal would have a problem getting elected.''
   But Paul Peterson, director of the Center for the Study of
American Government, said, ``Whenever any candidate has
enthusiastic support within the black community, it is going to
cost him support within sectors of the white community.''
   Joseph Grandmaison, Democratic chairman in New Hampshire,
believes the disadvantage Jackson suffers from race is offset by
the loyalty of his natural constituency.
   ``Look at Super Tuesday _ 25 percent of the voters could
immediately identify with him,'' Grandmaison said.
   ``I think that's good. It's healthy,'' he said, comparing
Jackson's gains from race to the loyalty Americans of recent ethnic
origin feel toward Dukakis, son of Greek immigrants.
   Wattenberg said he regards Jackson ``as a political genius.'' He
says a black ``would surely get the nomination'' if he combined the
political skills of a Jackson and the moderate positions of a Tom
Bradley, the black mayor of Los Angeles who narrowly missed being
elected governor of California.
   ``I'm not saying there is no racism in America; we all know
there is,'' Wattenberg said. ``But the right candidate could deal
with it.''

<HEAD>Earl Says Egyptian Antiquities Brought into England Legitimately</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Earl of Carnarvon said Egyptian relics found
in his family mansion were brought to Britain legitimately by his
grandfather and Howard Carter, the man who discovered the tomb of
Tutankhamen.
   Antiquities officials in Egypt have said they may try to recover
the trove of 300 objects discovered recently in Highclere Castle,
the ancestral home of the fifth earl of Carnarvon, grandfather of
the current earl.
   But they said they will take no action until more is known about
the find.
   The fifth earl, himself an Egyptologist, financed the expedition
led by Carter which found the almost intact and gold-filled tomb of
the pharaoh in Egypt in 1922.
   ``The records we have discovered show these items were brought
to England legitimately, with the knowledge of the Egyptian
government, by my grandfather and Howard Carter,'' said Lord
Carnarvon.
   He said he had informed the Egyptian ambassador in Britain of
the find ``but I don't expect any serious claim to be made by the
Egyptian government as this could involve the major part of my
grandfather's collection, which is in the Metropolitan Museum of
New York.''
   Ibrahim el-Nawawy, undersecretary of state for the Egyptian
Antiquities Organization, said in Cairo on Tuesday that he was
excited by the find but wants to determine what it includes before
taking action.
   ``It is difficult to say what steps we will take,'' he said.
``We will have to go back through our records to see if the items
were registered and legally taken out of Egypt.''
   The fifth earl died in 1923 from an infected mosquito bite,
nurturing a myth that the 19-year-old pharaoh who died in 1323 B.C.
had put a death curse on anyone who violated his tomb.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz says he
will press efforts to revive the Middle East peace process because
he is ``absolutely convinced there is an answer out there.''
   Talking to reporters after meeting Wednesday with the House
Foreign Affairs Committee, Shultz said his plan for peace between
the Israelis and Palestinians is ``a pretty good and balanced
concept.''
   Shultz had just briefed the committee privately on his recent
mission to the Middle East.
   ``What we really need to have happen is to get started, get
started on negotiations,'' Shultz said. ``I'm absolutely convinced
that if we can ever get the key people talking and negotiating that
there's an answer out there.''
   Committee Chairman Dante Fascell, D-Fla., said afterward that
``there was tremendous support for what the secretary has
undertaken.''
   Fascell said stern Israeli action to quell persistent violence
in the occupied territories has convinced most members of Congress
of the urgent ``need to find a way into a peace process that will
provide security for all of the inhabitants of the Middle East.''
   ``If a vote had been taken in there it would have been unanimous
in support for what the secretary is trying to do,'' Fascell said.
   The vote of confidence in Shultz comes a week before the planned
visit here by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who on
Wednesday expressed astonishment at a letter from 30 senators who
said Israel should be willing to give up control of occupied land
in return for Middle East peace.
   Shamir has blocked attempts inside the Israeli Cabinet to force
a vote on the Shultz plan. The plan calls for an international
conference, to be followed by talks on self-administration for
Palestinians in the occupied territories and negotiations on the
final status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``Your letter came as a surprise, at a crucial moment in the
peace efforts,'' Shamir wrote in a three-page response. ``We were
astonished by the words of criticism you leveled at us on the
formula of `territory for peace.'''
   Shamir's letter was sent to Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Rudy
Boschwitz, R-Minn., said Levin administrative assistant Gordon
Kerr. Both senators, strong supporters of Israel, were out of town
and unavailable for comment Wednesday night.
   Twenty-three Democratic and seven Republican senators had sent a
letter to Shamir last week in which they noted that Israel in the
past had supported the idea of ``land for peace'' by returning the
Sinai Peninsula to Egypt.
   They noted that Shamir had rejected ``this expression of
territory for peace'' and expressed hope that the prime minister's
statement ``did not indicate that Israel is abandoning a policy
that offers the best hope for long-term peace.''
   Shamir, in his response, said Israel accepts the U.N. Security
Council resolution that provides for an Israeli withdrawal from
land captured in the 1967 war but he did not agree to Israel's
eventual withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza.
   Shamir has opposed an international conference on the Middle
East on grounds it would put Israel at serious disadvantage.
   But Fascell suggested that it might be possible to hold an
international conference that would not disadvantage Israel,
especially if the ground rules for the meetings did not permit an
imposed solution or give participating countries veto power.

<HEAD>Dole Attacks Bush in Illinois TV Ad</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Bob Dole sounded the first negative note
of the TV campaigns leading up to next week's Illinois presidential
primary with an attack on Vice President George Bush's Iran-Contra
role.
   With his candidacy at stake in Illinois after losing all 17
Super Tuesday contests, the Kansas senator on Wednesday revived an
ad that says ``Bush approved selling arms to the Ayatollah'' at the
same time he chaired a terrorism task force that said America would
never sell arms for hostages.
   The ad says Bush has ``changed his story nine times'' and owes
voters ``an honest answer'' about his role in the affair.
   Bush was nearly two-thirds of the way to the GOP nomination
after sweeping the Super Tuesday states. He is hoping to ride TV
ads and local endorsements to an Illinois victory that would end
the Senate Republican leader's bid.
   Bush's initial TV ads in Illinois emphasized his connection with
President Reagan. In one ad he and Reagan are shown walking
together, arms around each other, projecting an old-pals image.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis led the Democratic field
after Super Tuesday with victories in seven states. He and Sen.
Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee said they would compete full-tilt in
Illinois despite the presence of favorite sons Jesse Jackson and
Sen. Paul Simon.
   Dukakis started two ads Tuesday night in Illinois. In one, a
Massachusetts official of the international bricklayers union says
Dukakis's economic policies ``put people to work.'' The other ad
highlights Dukakis' experience as a chief executive and says it is
unique to the Democratic field.
   Dukakis spokesman Steve Akey said Dukakis spent $1.5 million on
TV advertising for Super Tuesday. ``We haven't made the decision on
a total media buy for Illinois but we'll be on a significant
amount,'' Akey said.
   Gore spent close to $3 million on Super Tuesday media and won
six states. Spokesman Paul Risley said that ``we fully intend to
run a full (media) campaign up there'' in Illinois, but no spending
figure has been fixed.
   There was some possibility that Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt
would buy Illinois television time, but spokesman Mark Johnson said
the congressman would save most of his resources for the March 26
caucuses in Michigan.
   ``We'll definitely do a full-scale (TV) effort in Michigan,''
Johnson said. As for Illinois, ``We're still considering that
option.''
   Gephardt suffered devastating losses on Super Tuesday, spending
$1.1 million on television ads but winning only his home state.
Part of his problem was being the target of negative ads by both
Dukakis and Gore.
   Akey said the Dukakis campaign went negative on Super Tuesday to
counter ``distorted Gephardt campaign ads.'' Asked if the campaign
is ready for a Gore offensive, he replied, ``We are always prepared
to respond.''
   Jackson and Simon said they planned little or no advertising in
their home state. ``I offer Illinois 30 years of service rather
than a 30-second commercial,'' said Simon, who skipped the Super
Tuesday contests.
   Jackson won five states on Super Tuesday with a minimal $100,000
media campaign and is expected to do well Saturday in South
Carolina, where he was born. His campaign is in debt but raised a
substantial amount of money in February and may buy more media time
in New York, California and other large states later in the
election season, according to campaign manager Gerald Austin.

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis Have The Cash As Well As Delegates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush and Michael Dukakis both have
large cash reserves to protect their delegate leads as their rival
presidential hopefuls must refill campaign coffers depleted by the
Super Tuesday marathon.
   Dukakis, who leads the Democratic delegate chase, was sitting on
a cache of $2 million and anticipating $1 million more in matching
funds next week, said campaign finance chief Robert Farmer.
   It was not known exactly how much cash Bush has on hand as he
tries to follow up his sweep of 16 GOP primaries with a knock-out
punch against Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas in next Tuesday's Illinois
primary and beyond.
   But Bush's campaign has been better heeled and more frugal all
along than Dole's or Pat Robertson's.
   Bush had more than $9 million in the bank at the start of
February, the Bush campaign's director of operations, Ede Holiday,
said Wednesday. The bills are still coming in from the Super
Tuesday states, she said, but ``we clearly have plenty of money
left.''
   At Dole headquarters, spokeswoman Dale Tate said: ``We aren't in
the hole. We have cash on hand.'' She declined to say how much. The
Dole campaign was anticipating staff cutbacks.
   Thomas Rath, a senior Dole strategist, said in Chicago that the
campaign will have enough money to run commercials in Illinois. He
said the Kansas senator raised more than $240,000 last week.
   Robertson said Tuesday night: ``I do have resources left. We
have the largest donor base of any candidate and I can carry all
the way to New Orleans.''
   The former television evangelist had spent $17.6 million through
January, and ended that month with $5.5 million in cash but debts
of $6 million.
   What Jesse Jackson calls his ``poor campaign with a rich
message'' has raised $600,000 since the Iowa caucuses Feb. 8,
according to campaign manager Gerald Austin. That is more than the
civil rights leader has ever raised before in such a short time.
   Austin said the Jackson campaign has $250,000 in cash on hand
and anticipates $600,000 in federal matching funds in mid-March.
   Jackson said his wins in five Democratic primaries in the South
came despite being outspent 20- and 30-to-1 by Al Gore Jr. and
Dukakis on television ads. Jackson says he spent just $100,000 on
ads in the Super Tuesday states.
   Austin said Jackson will be buying more television time in large
states like New York and California, and he anticipates earmarking
$30,000 of his $200,000 Illinois budget for television.
   A Gore campaign spokesman, Paul Risley, said the Tennessee
senator spent ``somewhere close to $3 million'' on ads in the Super
Tuesday states. The Dukakis campaign said it spent $1.5 million,
while Rep. Richard Gephardt bought $1.1 million worth of air time.
   Gephardt blamed his meager returns on Super Tuesday _ he lost
everywhere but at home in Missouri _ on his inability to counter
the drumbeat of Gore and Dukakis ads.
   ``With 20 states and a million dollars, we just could not get
our message ... in front of the voters,'' Gephardt said. He claimed
they spent up to $7 million to defeat him.
   Gephardt's deputy campaign manager, Joe Trippi, said Gephardt
has $250,000 on hand and debts of only $75,000. Trippi said the
campaign hopes to raise $500,000 over the next two weeks.
   Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, who bowed out of the Super Tuesday
contests to make a low-budget stand at home, said of his campaign,
``It's kind of a hand-to-mouth operation.''
   The Simon campaign has missed one payroll and is in danger of
missing a second. But Simon raised $932,000 in February and soon
will get $364,000 in matching funds, spokesman Terry Michael said.
   Simon owes $145,000, but ``we are in much better financial
condition right now than either the Gore or the Gephardt
campaigns,'' claimed Michael.

   The cigarette girl has returned to the fabled
Rainbow Room on the Manhattan skyline like a vision from an old
movie of wasp-waisted men in tails and gorgeous dames in sequined
gowns.
   ``Cigars, cigarettes?'' she coos to the swells sipping
cocktails, a girl with a tray of smokes, a jaunty pillbox hat,
puffed sleeves, pumps and fishnet stockings, a neckline down to
there and a skirt slit up to here.
   This is the 1980s, though, and you may call her a ``cigarette
woman.'' The people who run the Rainbow Room atop the art-deco RCA
Building use both terms.
   The rehabilitation of the famous Rockefeller Center nightspot
reportedly cost $25 million, much of it for new plumbing, lighting,
kitchens, carpets and custom work. But there was enough left over
to hire cigarette girls.
   ``They seem to fit in beautifully,'' said Joseph Baum, the
restaurateur who masterminded the restoration intent on recapturing
the nightclub's glory days of the '30s and '40s. ``It's a
lighthearted expression of the time.
   ``They're in their wonderful flouncy dresses and their little
pageboy hats _ it just makes everyone smile. I think that is just
part of the scene,'' he said.
   The four girls _ and cigarette girl Katherine Reddick prefers
that term _ were chosen from the ranks of pagers and coat-checkers.
``It sounded interesting,'' said Ms. Reddick, 24, of Manhattan.
   ``I'm here not so much to sell cigarettes, but I'm really adding
elegance to the room,'' she said, though sales are brisk, with
occasional $100 nights and plenty of generous tips. ``I get lots of
comments. People say it brings them back to the '30s and '40s. I'm
glad to be able to reminisce with them.''
   Her costume is a 1930s style created by theatrical costume
designer Carrie Robbins. ``I saw it and said, `No problem,''' Ms.
Reddick recalled with a smile.
   ``I wanted it so that it was suggesting rather than
suggestive,'' Baum said. ``It's lighthearted, rather than what a
lot of people have in mind when they think of a cigarette girl.
There's plenty of romance without having to add to it.''
   And just what do people have in mind? Judging from the movies,
perhaps a bit of a tart, a young woman in the wrong kind of place
at too late an hour?
   ``I've run into so many ladies who were cigarette girls in the
'40s,'' said Ms. Reddick. ``They were flabbergasted to see me. If I
help bring back those memories, that's a great feeling. They say
being a cigarette girl in those days was a very, very important
thing.
   ``Of course, they did it without having their parents find out _
they were working in bars.''
   Patrons of the new-old Rainbow Room welcome the women who sell
the cigarettes at $2 a pack with smiles.
   ``Whenever I thought of a cigarette girl, it was in a 1930s
movie, with a big, chic nightclub,'' said Tom Cordisco, 27, of
Brooklyn. ``That's what it reminds you of.''
   That's just what Baum had in mind. ``A lot things that were part
of that scene disappeared,'' he said. ``Costs went up, places
didn't do these sort of things for a long time.''
   Bringing back cigarette girls, he said, ``brings back the sound
of Astaire, and lobster Thermidor, and dancing, and the Rainbow.''

<HEAD>Man Sentenced To Two Months For Organizing `Happening'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of an opposition cultural group
was sentenced to two months in prison because of the troupe's
latest ``street happening'' satirizing the government, an
opposition activist said.
   In another development, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa criticized
police for using force to break up student demonstrations in Warsaw
and Krakow.
   About 50 supporters of the opposition group Orange Alternative,
some carrying a banner reading ``Missiles _ no, sanitary pads _
yes,'' handed out cotton pads to women in Wroclaw on Tuesday, said
Jacek Kuron, a Warsaw opposition activist. Feminine hygiene
products are in short supply in Poland and Tuesday was
International Women's Day.
   Police moved in quickly and halted the demonstration in the
southwestern city, arresting Orange Alternative leader Waldemar
Frydrych, 34, and five other people, said Kuron.
   On Wednesday, Frydrych was sentenced to two months in prison on
a charge of causing public unrest. The action marked one of the few
times since a September 1986 amnesty for political prisoners that a
lower court has sentenced someone to prison for a politically
motivated offense.
   In almost all cases, people were held up to 48 hours and
released after being fined.
   Kuron said two other Orange Alternative supporters were each
fined the equivalent of $80.
   He said the Orange Alternative members joked with the court by
arguing that Karl Marx, the founder of communism, was actually a
bearded lady.
   Frydrych has been detained at least half a dozen times since
September for organizing various Orange Alternative ``happenings''
in Wroclaw in which demonstrators have dressed up as Santa Claus,
Lenten penitents and even secret policemen to satirize government
policies.
   Walesa's comment on Wednesday came one day after club-wielding
riot police clashed with youths demonstrating for more academic
freedom on the 20th anniversary of student protests against
censorship and political repression.
   On Tuesday, police charged into hundreds of demonstrators in
Warsaw and Krakow. The government said 83 people were arrested and
all but 15 had been released.
   The students were calling for restoration of academic freedoms
won during the 1980-81 Solidarity labor upheaval and for
legalization of the Independent Students Union.

<HEAD>FAA Rejects Blanket Restrictions On Accident Overflights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration has
declined to issue tighter restrictions suggested by another agency
on planes and helicopters flown by the news media and others over
major accident sites.
   The FAA said the restrictions suggested by the National
Transportation Safety Board would be impractical.
   The NTSB had urged that the FAA prohibit aircraft flights over
major accident sites, especially when they involve spills of
hazardous flammable materials or a fire and rescue workers might be
endangered.
   The NTSB had cited a series of accidents - most of them
involving train wrecks in which toxic substances were spilled
-where news media helicopters flew so close to the accident scene
that they endangered rescue workers.
   But FAA Administrator Allan McArtor wrote to NTSB Chairman Jim
Burnett recently that the agency saw no reason to change the rules.
A copy of the letter was made available Wednesday.
   Current FAA regulations require the agency to issue a formal
notice in each individual case to pilots when flights over an
accident site must be prohibited because of a potential danger.
   The safety board said that the notice is often not readily
available to pilots and that some pilots may specifically avoid
asking about a notice so they may legally fly over an accident site.
   In responding to the safety board, which is in charge of
investigating major transportation accidents, McArtor called the
current restrictions that are tailored to each accident ``the most
effective approach.''
   To change the regulations as the NTSB had recommended it ``would
be necessary to describe every type of potential disaster or hazard
that may occur,'' McArtor said. He also said pilots may not know
when such restrictions are in force.
   While rejecting the NTSB's call for broader restrictions, the
FAA, nevertheless, said it was calling for tighter enforcement of
existing restrictions. It said the FAA intends to aggressively
enforce sanctions against pilots who intentionally violate the
terms of the mandatory notice when it is put into effect at an
accident site.
   Violators would have their pilot's license suspended for a
minimum of 180 days.
   The NTSB had said that a number of accidents dating back to 1978
demonstrated a problem with how the FAA restricts aircraft at
accident sites. In several of the cases the downwash from
helicopters interfered in rescue attempts by fanning the flames of
a fire or blowing toxic vapors in the direction of workers, the
safety board said.
   There recently have been several incidents in which helicopter
pilots helped in rescue attempts or - as was the case in Denver
-helped apprehend a criminal.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said, however, that these incidents
had no bearing on the agency's response to the NTSB recommendations.
   The agency agreed with two NTSB recommendations aimed at
offering guidance to pilots on obtaining information about flight
restrictions that are put in place and developing ways to better
educate pilots about the dangers of flying too close to an accident
site.

   Nuclear Regulatory Commission officials say
the agency's rules provide commercial reactors adequate safeguards
against terrorist attacks but its staff will additionally look at
the potential threat from truck bombs.
   NRC Chairman Lando W. Zech told a House subcommittee Wednesday
that the commission has confidence in the current safety rules, but
recently instructed its staff to draft a series of options related
to a truck-bomb threat ``as a prudent measure.''
   The disclosure came as NRC officials clashed with Rep. Sam
Gejdenson, D-Conn., chairman of the House Interior and Insular
Affairs subcommittee on general oversight and investigations, over
commission security requirements.
   Gejdenson urged the commission to beef up its security
standards, which require plant operators to protect against a
hypothetical threat of ``several'' terrorists armed with hand-held
automatic weapons and aided by an accomplice inside the plant.
   Fuel from traditional U.S. commercial reactor cannot be stolen
and used to make nuclear bombs. But Gejdenson said he feared
terrorists could break into a nuclear reactor, hold it and the
surrounding region hostage or trigger a nuclear meltdown that would
release deadly radiation into the atmosphere.
   Rep. Peter A. DeFazio, D-Ore., pointed to a threat last June
from state-run Tehran radio that said Iran could attack U.S.
reactors in retaliation against American forces in the Persian Gulf.
   ``You have people here who want to be martyrs,'' DeFazio said.
   Gejdenson said the regulations should protect against a car or
truck bursting through a plant's chain-link fence, attackers
invading from a boat, and truck bombs like the ones used in
terrorist attacks overseas.
   ``Simple prudence and common sense dictate that the NRC assume
that terrorist have cars and that licensees should be required to
protect against this level of threat,'' Gejdenson said. In an
interview last week, the congressman said ``the gang that couldn't
shoot straight could take any one of these facilities'' under the
current standards.
   Zech said the regulations are ``adequate and appropriate at this
time.'' And he said the NRC is in daily contact with U.S.
intelligence agencies monitoring any potential threats.
   But he added that the NRC told the staff last month to prepare
``a range of options'' regarding a truck-bomb threat for commission
consideration. Such recommendations could eventually become
regulations, said NRC spokesman Bob Newlin.
   Zech said the staff review stems from a December classified
report by the National Security Council, but Gejdenson contended
the move was a response to his investigation.
   Gejdenson said that the agency began working on a truck-bomb
regulation following the October 1983 bombing of the Marine
barracks in Lebanon, but that the commission never approved the
proposal.

   A top Haitian army officer reportedly indicted with
his ex-wife and brother on drug charges was the second Caribbean
military leader in four weeks to be accused here of helping cocaine
smugglers.
   A federal grand jury Wednesday indicted Col. Jean-Claude Paul,
commander of the largest unit in Haiti's 6,000-man army; Paul's
brother Antonio; and ex-wife Merielle Delinois, sources close to
the case said on condition of anonymity.
   A witness has said the colonel allowed cocaine smugglers to land
at his ranch.
   U.S. Magistrate William C. Turnoff ordered the indictment sealed
immediately, but federal authorities were expected to unseal it
today.
   There was no comment Wednesday from the colonel or Haiti's
government.
   Paul heads the feared 700-man Dessalines Battalion in the
capital of Port-au-Prince. Soldiers in the battalion ruthlessly
suppressed anti-government demonstrations last year and were
accused of protecting gunmen who disrupted Haiti's November
presidential elections, killing 34 people.
   Paul was considered close to the military-dominated junta that
ruled Haiti from early 1986 until a military-supported civilian
president took office Feb. 7.
   On Feb. 5, Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was
indicted in Miami and Tampa on charges he accepted $4.6 million in
protection money from Colombian cocaine dealers, laundered money,
supplied drug laboratories and shielded drug kingpins.
   The investigation of Paul has been widely reported for weeks.
Haitian army officials and the government-controlled media have
defended him against reports of his involvement in cocaine
trafficking.
   Asked during a recent interview about reports of drug smuggling
by the army, President Leslie Manigat said, ``I can't base my
judgment on rumors.''
   All interviews with army officials must be cleared through army
chief of staff Gen. Carl Nicolas, who refused a written request
from The Associated Press to speak with Paul.
   The junta replaced dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier in February
1986, when he fled to exile in France.
   During the junta's two-year rule, Paul seldom appeared in public.
   When he did, it often was to serve as bodyguard for two junta
members, Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, the junta president and now
military chief, and Brig. Gen. Williams Regala, now defense
minister. Paul also appeared on the stage during Manigat's
inauguration at which the president pledged to stop drug
trafficking. The colonel was among the military guards who escorted
Manigat back to the presidential palace after the inauguration.
   One of the witnesses in the case was Miami businessman Osvaldo
Quintana, 35, who told a news conference last month that the
colonel helped him smuggle cocaine into the United States in
December 1986.
   ``We flew (the shipment) out of his own personal ranch in
Haiti'' about 90 miles outside Port-au-Prince, said Quintana, who
has testified for the government in drug trials.
   Quintana has said Haitian military officials routinely aided
drug flights from Colombia, allowing them to land and be serviced
before proceeding to the Bahamas to drop their loads.
   He said he originally was approached by Ms. Delinois to take
part in the smuggling.
   Ms. Delinois was arrested in Miami on drug charges last March,
but skipped bond and is believed to be hiding in Haiti, according
to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
   DEA affidavits filed in the Delinois case said Quintana met with
Paul and his brother Antonio at the ranch, and watched while a
plane carrying 220 pounds of cocaine took off.

   Democratic presidential contender Michael
Dukakis, saying he's in an ``uphill battle'' in Ilinois, attacked
rival Sen. Albert Gore Jr. as a regional candidate who would have
little chance to win the general election in November.
   The Massachusetts governor is also touting himself as the
candidate who has the best track record on the economy.
   Dukakis began airing a television spot here in which a
bricklayers' union official tells voters that if they want to go
out for a beer they should call their buddy, but ``if you care
about your job, Mike Dukakis is your guy.''
   In Tuesday's Illinois primary, Illinois Sen. Paul Simon is
expected to garner favorite-son votes and the Chicago-based Jesse
Jackson is likely to tap black support in his hometown.
   That leaves Dukakis battling Gore for the remaining share. And
Dukakis suggested that he was a better choice to represent the
party as the nominee.
   ``I'm not so sure he's a major contender,'' Dukakis said of
Gore. ``A guy from Massachusetts beat him in Texas, beat him in
Florida. He wasn't willing to go into the early primaries. But I
still take everyone seriously.''
   Michael Bakalis, Dukakis' Illinois campaign chairman, said white
blue-collar voters in Chicago could form Dukakis' base in Illinois.
   ``Paul Simon in the 1984 Senate race did not do very well in
Chicago, particularly in the white, ethnic precincts,'' Bakalis
said.
   Those were precisely the precincts Dukakis targeted Wednesday in
his first full day of campaigning in Illinois in the week leading
up to the primary.
   He met over breakfast with laid-off steel workers and then
visited the Metron steel warehouse in Chicago, owned by one of
Dukakis' many Greek-American supporters, Andrew Athens.
   Illinois will send 173 delegates to the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta. Of those, 113 will be decided next Tuesday.
The rest are held by various party and elected officials. Bakalis
said 74 of the 113 will come from the greater Chicago area.
   The Dukakis camp plans to wage a traditional campaign in
Illinois, with an appearance at tonight's Democratic party dinner,
a spot in Chicago's famous St. Patrick's Day parade and a message
geared toward working men and women, said Dukakis national
political coordinator Charles Baker.
   ``Win, lose or draw _ and we don't expect to win _ you want
people here to care about this race,'' Baker said.
   The Dukakis campaign remains the financial front-runner after
the media spending of Super Tuesday. Campaign finance chief Robert
Farmer said Dukakis is raising half a million dollars a week.
Coming out of Super Tuesday, he said, Dukakis has $2 million in the
bank and another $1 million on the way in federal matching funds.
   Bakalis said the governor has budgeted $300,000 to $350,000 for
the state leading up to next Tuesday. That amount could increase,
he said, if Dukakis decides to increase his media advertising.
   With two Illinois residents in the race, ``Obviously it's going
to be an uphill battle,'' Dukakis said.
   ``At this point I think that most people would think that third
place would be respectable,'' he said. ``But I want to do better
than that.''

<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration is coming
under criticism from its boss for not being aggressive enough in
issuing civil fines against airlines because of airport security
shortcomings.
   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley says he is disturbed that
the FAA has not been complying with a directive issued last summer
and reiterated in October, calling for ``aggressive enforcement''
actions against airlines that allow mock weapons to go undetected
at an airport screening point.
   The FAA has been testing security at the nation's airports by
passing phony weapons through the checkpoints to see if they are
found. Last year a report concluded that as many as one in five
mock weapons in FAA tests go through undetected.
   The discovery prompted the Transportation Department to order
the FAA to get tough with airlines so that security is improved.
The airlines are responsible for airport security checkpoints,
although the stations are usually staffed through a contractor.
   Burnley said Wednesday that the department specifically told the
FAA to take enforcement actions, including a possible fine, when a
security checkpoint allows a mock weapon through without detection.
   Burnley aides released a sharply worded memorandum sent earlier
this week to FAA Administrator Allan McArtor. In it, the
transportation secretary said he was ``deeply disturbed'' that five
months after the crackdown was ordered, ``the FAA is only taking
action if carriers fail three out of five tests at a checkpoint and
is only issuing a fine for the third failure.''
   ``I am troubled by continuing reports of failure by the FAA to
fully implement these directed improvements and to strictly enforce
security requirements,'' he wrote.
   McArtor said in a statement, ``I absolutely share Secretary
Burnley's concern that FAA aggressively implement all security
recommendations. I have instructed FAA personnel that the rules
must be strictly enforced.''
   Agency officials had no further comment.
   The incident, however, is likely to further strain relations
between Burnley and McArtor.
   The Washington Post reported earlier this week that Burnley was
displeased with the FAA's top public affairs officer because some
regulatory action involving commuter airlines had been disclosed
prematurely just when Burnley wanted media attention focused on a
speech he was making at the National Press Club.
   Wendy DeMocker, who is Burnley's spokesman, denied that Burnley
had anything to do with the departure of Air Force Lt. Col. James
C. Jannette from the post. Jannett, who had been at the job only
three months and had been a personal choice of McArtor, was asked
by the Pentagon to return to his military duties, she said.
   Meanwhile, there have been differences between McArtor and
Burnley on other aviation matters. Last year McArtor told reporters
he planned by April to submit legislation to Congress on a national
policy to deal with noise problems at airports.
   Burnley said Wednesday no such plans are in the works and that
McArtor had changed his mind. Burnley often has said he believes
such legislation would be foolhardy because Congress has no desire
to tell local officials what to do about airport noise.

   A gully caved in on three teen-agers as
they were playing in it, killing two, police said. The third was
able to dig his way out from the 5 feet of dirt and summon help.
   A witness said the cave-in occurred moments after he warned the
boys not to play in the gully.
   Joel Rogers and Damon Deakin, both 13 and from Albuquerque, were
killed in Wednesday's accident, said police spokesman Tony Herrera.
   Herrera said police received a call about 6 p.m. from residents
of a north side trailer park who saw the boys digging in the gully,
then saw a cloud of dust.
   A 14-year-old boy who also fell in managed to dig himself out
and go for help, said Herrera, who would not release the boy's name.
   Neighbors had pulled Rogers out and were trying to revive him
when officers arrived, Herrera said. Paramedics then pulled the
other boy out.
   Deakin was pronounced dead at the scene and Rogers at the
University of New Mexico Hospital.
   Police said the boys were trapped about 20 minutes. A witness
estimated they were under about 5 feet of dirt.
   Dave Wild, a resident of the trailer park, said he warned the
boys it was dangerous to dig in the arroyo.
   He said the boys continued to play in it and moments later he
saw the dust cloud.
   ``I didn't think anything of it,'' he said. ``Then I remembered
the kids digging. I ran out and one of them was yelling that the
other two were trapped inside. I jumped into the arroyo and started
digging.
   ``I kept digging until I got to a foot, then I reached his
head,'' he said. ``I pulled him out and he wasn't breathing.''
   Trailer park manager Kaylin Morris said she heard the boys
talking earlier in the day about digging a tunnel.
   She described them as good kids who often volunteered to do odd
jobs around the trailer park.
   ``The three were inseparable,'' she said. ``It was just like the
Three Musketeers.''

   A twin-engine plane crashed into a
residential neighborhood shortly after takeoff early Thursday,
killing at least three people, authorities said.
   The plane took off from Detroit City Airport and struck one or
two houses about five miles to the northwest, said Tim Stayer, a
worker at Universal Macomb Ambulance Service Inc. of Warren.
   He said the plane was heading for Oakland-Pontiac Airport at the
time of the crash.
   It was not known how many passengers were aboard the plane or in
any of the homes involved, Stayer said.
   Officials said at least three people were killed.
   The crash occurred at 12:30 a.m., Warren police Sgt. Richard
Pytlak said.
   The plane had been in the air one-to-two minutes before it
crashed, said Barbara Gardner-Martin, air traffic manager for City
Airport. She said that type of aircraft normally is used to carry
freight, but she said she did not know what or who was aboard the
flight.

<TEXT>
   Two years after they crashed the state
Democratic Party and helped to make their leader a household name,
Lyndon LaRouche's Illinois disciples have resurfaced again on the
state primary election ballot.
   Despite challenges from the Democratic Party, LaRouche and more
than 20 of his supporters are in the running in the party's primary
on Tuesday for posts ranging from president to county recorder of
deeds.
   For state party leaders, it's an unwelcome reminder of the upset
victories of two LaRouche followers in the 1986 Democratic primary,
an event that threw the party into disarray.
   ``We fell down on our job in `86,'' said state Sen. Vince
Demuzio, who became state Democratic Party chairman after the
primary debacle. ``Nobody gave them much chance to do anything and
we ended up with two of them on our ticket. We don't intend to
allow that again.''
   For the LaRouche supporters, it's another chance to air the
perennial presidential candidate's world view, in which various
conspiracies link AIDS, drugs, international bankers and the
British royal family.
   The 1986 victories of LaRouche's Illinois followers marked the
beginning of a period of heightened scrutiny that culminated in
raids by authorities on LaRouche's Leesburg, Va., headquarters and
his indictment in Boston on federal obstruction-of-justice charges.
   His supporters see these actions as a conspiracy by the
Democratic Party and the Soviet Union, who they believe are trying
to block LaRouche from gaining political power.
   ``If this man is such a wacko fringe candidate, why is the
Democratic Party spending all of this money to keep him out of the
election?'' said Sheila Jones, a leader of the LaRouche
organization in Illinois.
   Demuzio has a ready answer.
   ``He has repudiated the platform and leadership of the party
nationally and in Illinois,'' he said. ``We're not going to afford
these fringe candidates the chance to have the Democratic Party as
their haven.''
   But Illinois Democrats succeeded in only one of a flurry of
challenges to LaRouche-backed candidacies, leaving LaRouche and a
platoon of followers on the ballot:
   LaRouche's name will appear throughout the state on the March 15
Democratic presidential preference ballot. In four Chicago-area
congressional districts, LaRouche followers have filed full slates
of would-be delegates to the Democratic National Convention.
   LaRouche supporters will be on the ballot for Congress in at
least five districts, mostly in the Chicago area.
   And Janice Hart, one of the LaRouche supporters who won in 1986,
is running for Cook County Circuit Court clerk.
   Perhaps as a result of their 1986 success, LaRouche supporters
seem to have focused their efforts in Illinois, political observers
say.
   In the 10 other states where Democratic primary election filing
deadlines have passed, only four congressional candidates have been
identified as LaRouche disciples, said Peggy Connolly, spokeswoman
for the national Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
   ``It's a natural consequence of what they perceive as their
success there (in Illinois) in 1986,'' she said. ``They've lost
their wind in every other region of the country.''
   Democratic party leaders and candidates say the LaRouche
followers' campaigns in Illinois seem to have begun and ended with
the filing of nominating petitions to get on the primary ballot.
   With their legal challenges stymied, Democratic Party leaders
have focused their anti-LaRouche efforts on mailings to voters in
the areas where LaRouche followers are on the ballot.
   Cook County Democrats are circulating almost 3 million brochures
warning voters that ``the LaRouchies have invaded'' the ballot and
urging them to be careful when casting their votes.
   Some Democrats have discussed the possibility of rewriting state
election law to allow party leaders to ``screen'' candidates
seeking to run in the party primary, though they acknowledge doubts
about the constitutionality of such a measure.
   But Demuzio and other party leaders believe public disdain is
the only effective political weapon against LaRouche followers.
   ``I don't know how you keep them from getting on the ballot,''
Demuzio said. ``This is America, you know.''

   George Bush, with the support of Gov. Jim
Thompson and most Republican Party leaders, will stump his way
``through all corners'' of Illinois, his campaign says.
   After a one-day respite from campaign rigors, Bush was flying to
Chicago today to begin an intensive five days of vote-seeking as he
tries to pad his formidable lead in the race for nominating
convention delegates.
   Between now and next Tuesday, Bush will have criss-crossed the
state several times, with Thompson, a four-term governor, at his
side most of the way.
   He was beginning his campaign with a speech to the GOP Governors
Club Luncheon in Chicago, to be followed later in the day with
Lincoln Day dinner appearances in Champaign and Alton. Bush has the
endorsements of 93 of 102 county GOP chairmen in Illinois.
   The Bush campaign style will be similar to the one he used
successfully in New Hampshire, South Carolina and the Super Tuesday
states. He is scheduled to discuss agricultural issues Friday and
visit a methanol plant later that day.
   With Thompson at his side, Bush will enjoy the benefits of
having the support of the state's top office-holder.
   In advance of Bush's campaign foray, Thompson's press secretary,
David Fields, said the governor had virtually cleared his schedule
of any conflicting events.
   ``The governor and Bush will be together pretty much through the
whole five days,'' Fields said. ``We're talking about the length
and breadth of Illinois _ a pretty good cross-section.''
   Pete Teeley, Bush's chief spokesman, said of Thompson: ``He's a
terrific campaigner and we sure want him to be with us.''
   Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater said earlier this week that
the vice president, seeking to win the 82 convention delegates
Illinois offers, would ``go through all corners of the state,
campaign directly and forthrightly, discuss issues and get his
message out.''
   Bush, who has amassed 805 of the 1,139 delegates needed for
nomination, has refused to accept Sen. Bob Dole's demand that the
two meet in one-on-one campaign debates in Illinois.
   Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., co-chairman of the Bush campaign, said
that while Bush would travel throughout the state, he would focus
on the stronghold of the state Republican Party, the ``collar
communities'' surrounding Chicago.
   She said that Dole ``has a right to say to the Illinois farming
communities, `I'm one of you' and George Bush can't do that.''
   But Martin also said that ``Illinois is not Iowa, and our
farming communities did not have the same difficulties.''
   Bush finished a distant third behind Dole and Pat Robertson in
Iowa, and a part of the reason was disenchantment there with Reagan
administration farm policy.
   Martin said: ``I don't think there's any question that Bush will
win the popularity vote, but Dole will do well in some districts.''
   Ken Wright, one of Bush's principal strategists in Florida,
said: ``I think, going to Illinois, we've got a great organization
up there. Gov. Thompson is enormously popular there, and I think
he'll do very well.''

   Forty-four Ghanian immigrants
occupied a Varig airlines's main office and demanded to be taken to
Canada, upsetting furniture and scuffling with reporters before
leaving, the airline said.
   The 42 adults and two children arrived Feb. 3 in Rio for a
stopover en route from Lagos, Nigeria, to Canada.
   Federal police discovered their passports from Trinidad-Tobago
were false, and the Canadian government refused to let them enter
the country, Varig said in a statement.
   The group was staying in a hotel but the airline recently
stopped paying the bill for meals and accomodations.
   Varig said it would take the group back to Ghana, in West
Africa, if they obtained the necessary travel papers from the
Ghanian Embassy in Brasilia.
   State police surrounded the airline's office but the group left
after several hours.

   The fashion king of Milan, Giorgio the
Gorgeous, achieved the impossible and bettered his own best.
   Armani's fall-winter collection, shown Wednesday, was a power
house of ideas. He showed the tiniest jackets, cropping them just
above the waist. Sleeves were long and tight. The definitely marked
the demise of wide armholes and overly-padded shoulders.
   Always a jacket specialist, he offered more new shapes than ever
before. The choice ranged from a jacket that was raised in front
and dipped at the back. Then there was the one with the soft cowl
neckline and yet another that sported a side-zipped bandolier in
matching fabric.
   Pants were plentiful. They came cuffless in smooth wools,
falling loosely from unpressed waist pleats. He also showed some
Bermuda shorts and accompanied them with the thigh-high suede wader
boots that have been a main feature of these Milan shows.
   There were lots of different hat shapes, ranging from a coal
miner's cap to a broad-brimmed, flat-crowned felt of the sort that
Clint Eastwood usually favors in his cowboy movies.
   Fabrics, designed thread by thread by Armani the perfectionist,
were superb.
   Laura Biagiotti, the designer who lives and works out of a
medieval castle nestled in the countryside outside Rome, showed
styles that were perfect for an elegant castle dweller.
   There were soft cashmere ``horse blankets,'' ideal for keeping
out the chill along the ramparts. They wrapped up comfy
sweater-dresses, oversize twinsets or slim-fitting pants, all in
flat knit.
   Daytime colors were rustic: oatmeal, moss-green and maize. And
there was moderation in the details with a more natural
shoulderline, flat-heeled footwear and skirt-lengths just a
fraction above the knee.
   Biagiotti took Paisley-patterned fringed head scarves in fine
wool and fashioned them into wraparound skirts and did an
attractive series of that fashion indispensable _ the ever-popular
little black dress in velvet or silk crepe.
   On a completely different wavelength was the baby doll look of
the collection designed by Muriel Grateau for Complice. Models,
with elfin hairdos, wore short, high-waisted styles with
tight-fitting bodices and jauntily gathered skirts.
   A brand-new girlish look for coats in double wool crepe featured
a shoulder-framing cape collar and a broad martingale belt that
tied tightly in a bow at the waist in back.
   Party dresses came in the same style with waist gathers
transferred to just under the bust while mini-skirts were decorated
with frills and ribbon cockades.
   Almost all the clothes at Complice came in a rich Titian red,
lace-up shoes and stockings included.
   There is a certain style that the Italian designers have always
done beautifully: understated but elegant tailored blazers,
well-cut pants and loose top coats in men's-type smooth woolens.
   It is a look that is timeless and unbeatable, and the women of
Milan love it. Basile did it for them again, tucking pants into the
newly fashionable winter boots and putting velvet on collars for an
even more well-bred air.

   Stock prices rose on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in
heavy trading today, and the dollar rose slightly.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average advanced 12.43 points, or
0.05 percent, closing at 25,617.82. It had gained 139.66 points on
Wednesday.
   Trading was heavy at 1.6 billion shares, compared with 1.3
billion shares Wednesday.
   The dollar closed at 128.20 yen, up 0.12 yen from Wednesday's
close. It opened at 128.25 yen and ranged between 128.13 yen and
128.42 yen.
   Dealers said dollar trading was affected little by the Finance
Ministry's report late in the day that Japan's trade surplus had
declined from year-earlier figures for the 10th consecutive month.
They said the size of the surplus in February, $5.24 billion, was
within the range expected by the market. The surplus was $7.13
billion in February 1987.
   The U.S. primary elections also provided no surprises, they
added, and there has been a lack of interest in trading ahead of
the March 31 end of Japan's fiscal year.
   An official of Nomura Securities Co., who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that in stock trading, large-capital issues,
including shipbuilding, chemicals, textiles, steel and banks, were
popular with investors, reflecting an oversupply of money.
   Construction, real estate and rubber issues were weak, the
official said.
   Toshiaki Yui, a stock analyst at Nomura, said the popularity of
the large-capital stocks resulted in part from local government
plans to develop waterfront areas along Tokyo Bay. The plans are
scheduled to be announced later this month, he said.

<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino today called
``one-sided'' a report by Amnesty International alleging widespread
human rights abuse in the Philippines during her two years in
office.
   Also today, Mrs. Aquino said she had no plans to run for
re-election when her term expires in June 1992. It was the clearest
statement of her political intentions to date.
   Mrs. Aquino said there have been delays in punishing human
rights violators because the Philippines respects the rights of the
accused to due process.
   On Wednesday, the London-based human rights organization alleged
that Mrs. Aquino's government had used torture, murder and illegal
arrests in fighting the country's 19-year communist rebellion.
   Amnesty International called on the government to end killings
by military and paramilitary forces, saying they represented the
country's most serious human rights problem since mid-1987.
   ``I think the Amnesty International report was very one-sided,''
Mrs. Aquino told Filipino reporters. She said the organization had
relied only on social activist groups, such as the church-backed
Task Force-Detainees, in compiling its report.
   The president urged such groups to cooperate with the
government's Commission on Human Rights in providing documented
evidence to help find and punish human rights violators.
   On Wednesday, Task Force-Detainees said its investigation showed
that 7,444 Filipino civilians were arrested illegally in 1987,
eclipsing the 5,967 arrests in 1985, when Ferdinand Marcos was
president.
   Mrs. Aquino came to power when Marcos' authoritarian regime
collapsed in February 1986. There has been speculation Mrs. Aquino
would seek a second term, using a technicality in the new
constitution.
   ``I don't think so,'' she told Filipino reporters. She added:
``I have never had political ambitions.''
   The constitution, drafted by an Aquino-appointed commission and
approved in a plebiscite last year, limits the president and vice
president to one six-year term.
   But ``transitory provisions'' in the constitution, temporary
measures designed to ease the transition of power, also state that
the first regular elections for president under the new charter
will be held on the second Monday of May 1992.
   Some political observers and Aquino supporters have interpreted
the wording of the transitory provision to mean Mrs. Aquino is not
bound by the one-term limit.
   In its report, Amnesty International praised the Aquino
government for ``some very real progress'' in human rights,
particularly in restoring legal safeguards and in greatly reducing
the use of torture.
   But it called on the government to reaffirm publicly its
commitment to protect human rights. The report said Amnesty
International knew of no cases where soldiers had been punished for
human rights violations.
   It cited the February 1987 killing of 17 civilians in Lupao. The
military said the killings took place after a lieutenant was killed
by a communist sniper during a patrol in Lupao.
   ``With regards to no soldier being convicted, in fact charges
have been filed against the soldiers involved or implicated in the
Lupao massacre,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
   ``We are living in a democracy. While it is true there is
evidence ... everyone is entitled to due process of law. Even those
who are accused should have their day in court.''
   Mary Concepcion Bautista, chairwoman of the Commission on Human
Rights, also criticized the Amnesty International report as
``exaggerated.''
   She said the government was investigating about 200 cases of
human rights abuse, claiming ``there is a serious effort to clean
up.''
   Mrs. Bautista said investigations of human rights abuses against
the military were often not publicized to avoid demoralizing
soldiers who are fighting the rebels.
   ``The insurgents don't follow the rules,'' she said. ``Soldiers
complain that when they fight the insurgents, they have one hand
tied behind their back.''
   Last year about 150 police and soldiers were fatally shot on
Manila streets. Communist rebels claimed responsibility for about
half the killings.
   An average of 10 soldiers, civilians or police officers are
killed daily in clashes between government and rebel forces.

   A Swiss concert promoter filed suit against the
Royal Philharmonic Orchestra for reneging on an agreement to play
12 concerts in Jerusalem in May, officials said.
   An orchestra spokesman on Wednesday confirmed that the orchestra
had pulled out of the concerts, but said the suit would be
``vigorously defended.''
   ``We pulled out because we had to review our undertaking to 125
musicians because contractual payments had not been honored,'' said
the spokesman, who confirmed the suit had been received and who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Robin Shaw, the lawyer for the Geneva-based Opera on Original
Sites Inc., said in a statement the firm was suing for damages from
the canceled booking.
   The statement, released Wednesday, said the action was brought
because the orchestra failed to honor a contract to play the
concerts May 15-29.
   The orchestra was scheduled to play in performances of Verdi's
opera ``Nabucco'' as part of Israel's 40th anniversary
celebrations, it said.

   Chinese universities will sharply cut the rate of
growth in enrollment to cope with problems of overcrowding and
inadequate facilities, an official newspaper said today.
   College enrollment increases will be held to between 2 percent
and 5 percent annually from this year through 1990, compared to a
growth rate of 17 percent in the 1981-85 period, the China Daily
said.
   It said college administrators attending a national conference
agreed that the current goal of 750,000 undergraduates in 1990 is
not practical, and opted for a figure of 680,000.
   They said junior colleges, correspondence schools and other
programs will help satisfy the great demand among young Chinese for
higher education.

   Three former government ministers are being
investigated by a parliamentary committee about a scandal over
prison construction contracts.
   Italian media reported that Franco Nicolazzi, who resigned as
secretary of the tiny Social Democrat party February 29, and two
Christian Democrats, Clelio Darida and Vittorino Colombo, were
served notice Wednesday about the probe to clarify what, if any,
links they have to the scandal.
   The scandal, nicknamed the ``Golden Prisons'' case, involves
alleged bribes to obtain public works contracts.
   Nicolazzi was Public Works minister in several governments from
1980 through last June and secretary from October 1985 of a party
that won 3.4 percent of the vote in the June 1987 elections to the
Chamber of Deputies.
   Sen. Antonio Cariglia was elected in his place Wednesday evening
by the central committee of the party.
   Darida served as justice minister and subsequently government
participations minister from 1981 to March 1987.
   Colombo last held a Cabinet post in 1980 as post and
telecommunications minister. From 1979 to 1982, he was
vice-secretary of Christian Democrats, Italy's largest vote-getter.

<HEAD>Soviets Adjust Missile Force After Superpower Treaty, NATO Chief
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CASTEAU, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although the superpower missile treaty
has not been ratified yet, the Soviet Union is already adjusting
its nuclear missile force to regain firepower lost through the
accord, NATO's top commander said.
   The commander, U.S. Gen. John R. Galvin, said on Wednesday that
the moves were expected and were not in violation of the treaty
signed last December to eliminate the superpowers' medium- and
shorter-range nuclear missiles worldwide. Missiles covered by the
treaty have ranges from 300 to 3,000 miles.
   ``They are restructuring their missile force,'' Galvin said in
an interview with The Associated Press in his spartan office at
Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe. Galvin likened the
Soviet moves to reshaping a wall from which some stones have been
removed.
   ``I don't want to get too specific ... but I get some
indications that the Soviets are readjusting the stones on the
wall,'' he said, adding that the Western allies would do this, too.
   Galvin added: ``(The Soviets) will retarget other warheads into
Western Europe'' to cover military targets previously assigned to
the hundreds of SS-20 rockets to be dismantled under terms of the
superpower accord.
   He said it was not yet clear how the Soviets would accomplish
this. ``They may have to take ... warheads that were aimed in
another direction and aim them toward Western Europe,'' Galvin said.
   The net result, he said, is likely to be that the Soviets will
partially offset the loss of their SS-20s, which are triple-warhead
ballistic missiles capable of striking all of Western Europe.
   ``The overall capabilities of the Soviets would still be
somewhat lower _ a small amount lower _ because of the treaty,''
Galvin said. ``But the adjustments ... will to some degree cover
that.''
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization also is seeking to adjust
and modernize its remaining nuclear forces in Europe to partially
compensate for the loss of the U.S. cruise and Pershing 2 missiles.
But there is disagreement in NATO over how and when to do this.
   According to Galvin, it was important for NATO eventually to
replace its aging Lance short-range nuclear missiles, which are not
covered by the treaty, with a more modern version of longer reach.
But he said a final decision on replacing the Lance missiles in
West Germany was not needed before 1990.
   He said NATO arms modernization is necessary to help defeat one
of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's chief aims: to rid Europe
of all nuclear weapons.
   Despite Gorbachev's recent pronouncements about seeking a more
peaceful relationship with the West, Galvin said, the Kremlin
leader has not abandoned the long-standing Soviet aim of dominating
Western Europe.
   ``He's moving in exactly the same direction,'' he said.
   Galvin said many Westerners are responding to Gorbachev's softer
stance in the same way a hostage feels kindly toward his captor
after being released.
   ``Maybe we're seeing a little bit of that psychology where we
have felt ourselves under the pressure of the powerful military
forces of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact for so many decades
... that when we get some indication of a friendly nod in our
direction we respond enormously because it's such a change,'' he
said.
   According to Galvin, Western governments should not move too
quickly to encourage Gorbachev's efforts to modernize the Soviet
economy, since a stronger economy could make Moscow a more
formidable enemy.

   NBC must surrender to a judge outtakes from an
interview with a former Lyndon LaRouche consultant who said an aide
to the political extremist discussed a plot to assassinate Henry
Kissinger, a federal appeals court ruled.
   The decision Wednesday by the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld a lower court order that videotape of the entire interview
must be surrendered for possible use at the conspiracy and fraud
trial of LaRouche, six aides and five political organizations.
   The court also upheld a contempt citation against the network.
   NBC had contended that surrendering portions of the interview
that were not broadcast violated its First Amendment right against
judicial intrusion into news gathering and editorial decisions.
   U.S. District Judge Robert E. Keeton ruled that the rights of
the defendants to have access to the interview with Forrest Lee
Fick outweighed those of the network.
   ``At stake in the defendants' side of the equation are their
constitutional rights to a fair trial under the Fifth Amendment,''
the appeals court wrote in concurring with Keeton, whose original
order called for him to review the entire interview and determine
its relevance to the case.
   NBC attorney Floyd Abrams said the network would decide within a
few days whether to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``It is an opinion which we believe does not sufficiently
recognize the First Amendment rights of broadcasters,'' Abrams said.
   Keeton had issued a similar order requiring CBS to surrender
outtakes of an interview it conducted with another LaRouche aide.
CBS complied.
   NBC interviewed Fick for 100 minutes and in April 1986 broadcast
a one-minute portion of the interview in which Fick said he and
LaRouche aide Paul Goldstein discussed a plot to assassinate
Kissinger, the former secretary of state.
   Fick, of Reading, Pa., worked as a LaRouche security consultant
with another Reading man, Roy Frankhauser. Frankhauser was
convicted in December of conspiring to obstruct a federal grand
jury investigation of alleged credit card and loan fraud by
LaRouche followers during his 1984 presidential campaign.
   Fick was a prosecution witness against Frankhauser. Both are
expected to be called as witnesses at the trial of LaRouche and
aides including Goldstein.
   Defense lawyers contend the entire NBC interview will help show
Fick and Frankhauser were among scores of operatives planted in
LaRouche organizations by the FBI and CIA to gather information and
ultimately to ruin LaRouche and cripple his fund-raising operation.

   After a long, hard day of fighting crime
on the streets of Los Angeles, police detective Norman Nelson gets
his kicks by climbing onto the back of a 2,000-pound Brahma bull.
   ``Bull riding's a high,'' explains Nelson, 44, a three-time LAPD
bull-riding champion. ``You can't imagine it if you haven't
experienced it. But once you know that thrill, you don't want to
give it up.''
   And there's more than just kicks.
   Since taking up the sport in 1983, Nelson has been hooked,
horned, stepped on and knocked senseless. But he says there's a big
difference between busting crooks and riding Brahmas in a rodeo.
   ``With the bull, the danger comes from something you respect,''
Nelson said. ``You respect its strength, its power, its ability.
The bull doesn't care whether it kills you or not. It's a clean

   A 25 percent increase in attendance at the
Democratic caucus here was cause for rejoicing among party
stalwarts in Owyhee County, population 8,272.
   It meant they'd have a quorum. Murphy, a tiny community in
Idaho's southwestern corner, is reputed to be the smallest county
seat in the nation, consisting of the Owyhee County Courthouse and
several mobile homes.
   Sheriff Tim Nettleton, was one of four Democrats who attended
the caucus at the courthouse, locally famous as the site of
Murphy's one parking meter.
   When a man in a cowboy hat walked into the meeting room, his
arrival was seen as increasing attendance by 25 percent. ``I knew
there was something I liked about you,'' Nettleton said. ``You must
be a Democrat.''
   ``No,'' he replied. ``I just wanted to see the sheriff for a
minute.''
   Eventually, however, the Democrats rounded up a quorum.
   That put them one up on Democrats in heavily Republican Custer
County in central Idaho. They had a caucus scheduled Tuesday night,
but nobody came.

   The Seawolf, the Pentagon's newest nuclear
attack submarine scheduled to begin production later this year,
will help the United States dominate the Soviet Union at sea long
into the next century, the Navy says.
   The SSN-21 will have double the fire power and be faster,
quieter and more survivable than the SSN-688 Los Angeles class sub,
which the Seawolf is expected to replace as the nation's chief
attack submarine, Vice Adm. Bruce DeMars, assistant chief of naval
operations for undersea warfare, told a House panel Wednesday.
   The Seawolf, which has been in the research and design stage for
six years, has been criticized by some lawmakers who fear the sub
is not advanced enough for the Soviet's planned successor to their
Akula attack sub.
   But DeMars dismissed that notion, telling the House Armed
Services sea power subcommittee that the Seawolf is ``the
foundation for far-term submarine superiority.''
   Last year, a House subcommittee tried to delay funds for the
project, but Congress restored the money. Navy officials have
warned that such a delay could severely damage the Seawolf program
and cause massive cost overruns.
   DeMars said the project now is on schedule and on budget.

   Early models of the Baby Buddy clip-on
pacifier holder are being recalled by the Consumer Product Safety
Commission because of a potential choking hazard.
   About 9,000 of the holders were distributed nationwide in 1986
and 1987, officials said. They sold for about $3.95 each.
   While no injuries have been reported involving the holders,
parents were urged to return them to the store where purchased for
a free replacement. When tested, the small bear figure separated
from the holder and thus could pose a choking hazard, officials
said.
   New model holders can be distinguished by the two round holes in
the back of the clip. There are no holes in the clip of the holders
being recalled.
   Recalled pacifier holders include those with a pink ribbon and
white bear, blue ribbon and bear, yellow ribbon and brown bear, red
ribbon and white bear and red ribbon and brown bear.

<HEAD>Government To Appeal Judge's Ruling On Confession</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department has filed notice hat it
will appeal a federal judge's decision to suppress the confession
of a former Lebanese Shiite Amal militiaman accused of leading an
airline hijacking.
   The government's move Wednesday to appeal the ruling by U.S.
District Judge Barrington D. Parker stays the March 22 trial of
Fawaz Younis pending a ruling by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
here.
   Parker ruled last month that the FBI illegally obtained a
confession from Younis when he was arrested and interrogated for
four days aboard a Navy munitions ship in the Mediterranean after
being lured into an FBI-chartered yacht.
   The judge ruled that prosecutors could not use the confession as

<HEAD>Best-Selling Author, Publisher In Dispute Over Rights To Character
Jack Ryan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Author Tom Clancy hopes to learn in June
whether he or the Naval Institute Press of Annapolis, Md., calls
the shots for CIA operative Jack Ryan.
   The Washington Post reported today that Clancy and the Naval
institute are in a dispute over the rights to Ryan, a character in
Clancy's best-selling books ``The Hunt for Red October'' and
``Patriot Games.''
   The small institute had never before published an original work
of fiction when it brought out ``Red October'' in 1984 and
copyrighted the work in its own name. Clancy later signed a
three-book, $3 million contract with Putnam, a New York publishing
firm.
   The institute now is challenging Putnam's publication of ``The
Cardinal of the Kremlin,'' a new novel by Clancy with the Ryan
character. It also is seeking payment for use of the Ryan character
in last year's ``Patriot Games'' and wants a percentage of any
earnings from a proposed television mini-series of that novel, the
Post said.
   Clancy refused to comment on the advice of his lawyers, the
newspaper said. He took the case to the American Arbitration
Association last month, with a binding decision expected in June.

   A man bent on revenge after being convicted
of reckless driving and weapons violations died in a courtroom
gunfight after threatening to kill his prosecutor and critically
wounding a bailiff, authorities said.
   Jeremey Sigmond, 35, a decertified chiropractor from Sepulveda,
returned Wednesday to Los Angeles Municipal Court where he was
convicted the day before, and accosted his prosecutor, Jessica
Perrin Silvers, 49, threatening to kill her.
   ``He's just, in layman's terms, violently crazy, and I knew
it,'' the prosecutor said. ``So when I heard him talking in his
delusional voice and saying I should come with him I just thought
there's no way I'm going to do that.''
   A bailiff drew a gun on Sigmond. Sigmond threatened to shoot Ms.
Silvers and the bailiff dropped the weapon. But Ms. Silvers broke
away and Deputy Marshal Cliff Wofford burst into the room and shot
Sigmond.
   Wofford, 30, of Palmdale, was wounded in the abdomen in the
gunbattle and was in critical condition after surgery to repair
damage to his liver, said Betty Neilson, spokeswoman for St.
Joseph's Medical Center in Burbank.
   Police searched Sigmond's suburban home Wednesday for firearms
or explosives, but found only empty gun vaults. A neighbor, Maurice
Netter, said Sigmond had told him he was part of a federal witness
protection program and living under an assumed name.
   Sigmond was convicted Tuesday of four misdemeanors _ reckless
driving, evading police, carrying a loaded weapon and carrying a
concealed weapon _ stemming from an Oct. 22 high-speed chase.
   He testified at his trial that he thought he was being chased by
the Mafia instead of the California Highway Patrol. He claimed the
Mafia was harassing him in retaliation for a lawsuit he filed
against the Board of Chiropractors, alleging price-fixing and
restraint of trade.
   He had been appealing the revocation of his state license to
practice as a chiropractor.
   When arrested, Sigmond was wearing two bullet-proof vests and a
crash helmet and carrying a loaded .38-caliber revolver. He was
wearing a bullet-proof vest Wednesday, said police Lt. Charles
Massey.
   Sigmond's attorney, Norman Edell, described his client as an Air
Force veteran who held a second-degree black belt in karate and was
a collector of guns, most of which he recently had sold.
   ``He was very distraught because the case meant a lot to him. He
didn't take it passively but there was no indication of this,'' he
said.
   At his sentencing, which was scheduled for May, Sigmond could
have been ordered imprisoned up to 18 months.
   The courthouse is in the San Fernando Valley community of Van
Nuys, about 15 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ A strong earthquake shook people
awake on the Caribbean island of Trinidad early today but police
said they had no reports of injuries or damage.
   The quake, the strongest in the area in 78 years, measured 6.9
on the Richter scale and struck at 2:17 a.m. about 50 miles
southeast of the capital of Port-of-Spain, said the U.S. Geological
Survey's National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.
   ``No damage, no injuries. We just got a little shake and that's
all,'' said Lt. Velfukr Muhammed at police headquarters in the
capital of 55,800 people.
   ``I was in bed at the time and that woke me and everyone else in
the house,'' said Lionel Dixon, news editor of Radio Trinidad in
Port-of-Spain.
   A security guard at the station, San Keralli, said the building
shook for about 40 seconds. Dixon said some people ran into the
street in the suburb where he lives.
   Frank Baldwin, a USGS physical science technician in Golden,
said the epicenter appeared to have been in the Caribbean about 420
miles east of Caracas, Venezuela, in a seismic area lying on the
boundary between the Caribbean and the South American crustal
plates of the Earth.
   The quake was the area's largest since a magnitude 7.2 temblor
on Jan. 23, 1910.
   Trinidad is an island in the republic of Trinidad and Tobago, a
member of the British Commonwealth. About 1.2 million people live
in the oil-producing republic, which covers an area about the size
of Delaware and is one of the Caribbean's most prosperous countries.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage.

<HEAD>Cuba Invites U.N. Delegates To Check Human Rights Allegations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time, the Cuban government has
invited delegates of the U.N. Human Rights Commission to visit Cuba
to investigate the human rights situation on the island nation.
   One United States delegate called the offer a ``diversionary
tactic,'' while another questioned the way it was brought before
the commission.
   The chief Cuban representative to the 43-nation commission, Raul
Roa Kouri, said on Wednesday that six members could go to Cuba ``in
order to see ... the situation prevailing there in human rights and
to inform the commission.''
   Roa, who is also a deputy foreign minister, said the commission
members allowed to visit would be the chairman, Alioune Sene of
Senegal, and five other delegates, one from each of the regional
groups.
   Reading what he said was a letter to Sene from his government,
Roa indicated that the Cuban government would arrange ``the
necessary contacts and interviews with the officials and competent
authorities of our country who would answer all their questions.''
   He also said the representatives would be given access to
``penitentiary establishments,'' but did not elaborate. Roa did not
give a date for the planned visit.
   Roa's remarks in Spanish were translated into English by an
interpreter. U.S. delegate Daniel Pipes said the Cuban invitation
was made to draw attention away from a U.S.-proposed resolution,
which calls for the U.N. secretary-general to investigate charges
of human rights abuses in Cuba and for Cuba to allow the
International Red Cross to visit Cuban prisons.
   ``They're afraid of the vote'' on that resolution, Pipes told
The Associated Press.
   Another U.S. delegate, Lewis Anselem, told the commission the
Cuban invitation was ``the first time that the Cuban government has
shown a willingness to have a United Nations organ look into the
human rights situation in that country and into the allegations
about that situation.''
   But Anselem said some of the procedures used to bring it before
the commission were ``highly irregular.''
   The proposed visit was introduced in the commission meeting by
Colombia, reportedly with the support of Argentina, Mexico and
Peru, all members of the commission. Cuba is an observer this year.
   Anselem said the United States would not accept the proposed
visit as a substitute for its own resolution.
   The United States for the second year in a row is pursuing its
goal of having the commission examine alleged human rights abuses
in Cuba. This year the U.S. government appointed a former Cuban
political prisoner, Armando Valladares, to head the U.S. delegation.
   The Cuban government has attacked the appointment of Valladares,
a poet who wrote a book about torture and degrading treatment he
said he suffered during 22 years in Cuban prisons.
   Valladares has said the United States, in pressing the Cuba
issue, is trying to fight a ``selective sensitivity'' in the
commission, which routinely condemns human rights violations in the
Israeli-occupied territories, Chile and South Africa.
   The United States maintains that human rights abuses in Cuba
include torture, clandestine executions and religious and political
persecution.
   The U.S.-sponsored resolution cites allegations of human rights
abuses in Cuba made by other international groups, including
Amnesty International and the Organization of American States.
   The resolution is to be voted on before the commission ends its
annual meeting on Friday.

<HEAD>House Speaker To Democratic Candidates: Tone Down Negative Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, says he's
sent telegrams congratulating all the Democratic candidates who won
delegates on Super Tuesday and asking them to eschew negative ads
from now on in the campaign.
   ``Candidates with viable ideas and strong ideals do not need to
rely on negative campaigning which only tarnishes and muddles the
processes of democracy,'' Wright said.
   Wright said the use of negative ads had become a ``vogue,''
intensified by the short time between the New Hampshire primaries
and Tuesday's 20-state extravaganza.
   Super Tuesday, the brainchild of moderate and conservative
Democrats, Wright said, ``put a great premium on having an enormous
amount of money to spend in little quickie TV spots'' and denied
candidates the chance to be evaluated by voters on the merits of
their ideas.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The rush left ``no time to make a sensible ... appeal,'' Wright
said, and led candidates to ``succumb to the wicked blandishments
of those in the advertising fraternity'' who specialize in attack
ads.

   Former television evangelist Pat Robertson
finished fourth among Republican presidential candidates in a
preference poll of board members at the National Association of
Evangelicals' annual convention.
   Vice President George Bush received 40 percent of the vote
Wednesday. Kansas Sen. Robert Dole received 32 percent, New York
Rep. Jack Kemp 17 percent and Robertson 12 percent.
   The results ``confounded conventional wisdom that he would be
the near-unanimous choice of evangelical leaders,'' said Richard
Cizik, research director for the NAE in Washington.
   Among Democrats, Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt was supported by
37 percent of the board members. Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore
received 33 percent of the vote, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
16 percent, Illinois Sen. Paul Simon 11 percent and the Rev. Jesse
Jackson 5 percent.
   Wednesday's voting, conducted without discussion, was by
denominational presidents, organizational executives and lay

<HEAD>Speaker Says California Primary Could Decide Nominee</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assembly Speaker Willie Brown says
Jesse Jackson could win the California primary, which could decide
the Democratic presidential nomination.
   Brown, Jackson's national campaign chairman, also said his
candidate could have won two or three more states on Super Tuesday
if he had had money for television advertisements.
   ``We may well determine the Democratic nomination with the
California vote,'' Brown told reporters Wednesday.
   ``Probably Jackson is the favorite at the moment'' in the June 7
California primary, one of the last in the country, Brown said.
   Brown, D-San Francisco, said Jackson will be in California on
March 19 and 20, including a visit to the state Democratic
convention in Palm Springs that weekend.
   Brown, who said he will be putting together a series of
nationwide concerts, featuring stars who support Jackson, to raise
money for the campaign, added that Jackson will be in California
``four or five times in April and on a regular basis in the month
of May.

<TEXT>
   With no seats and no food for the guests of
honor, everyone agreed that lunch at Sardi's had gone to the dogs.
   Two dogs, to be specific, the city's top police dog and the
nation's top show dog.
   The Dog Fanciers Club organized the event Wednesday to honor
Champion Great Elms Prince Charming II, a fluffy little Pomeranian,
and Nero, a big, amiable bruiser of a German shepherd.
   ``He's a very friendly dog,'' said Nero's master, Officer Joseph
Faraguna. ``In all the arrests I've made with him, he's only bitten
four times.''
   Nero specializes in sniffing out bombs and narcotics. He has
helped the Police Department make hundreds of arrests and has
``apprehended'' more than 50 felons.
   Nero was kept on his long leather leash while Prince emerged
from his elegant, padded carrying case only long enough to pose for
photographers.
   The Pomeranian was named best in show at the prestigious
Westminister Kennel Club Show in Madison Square Garden last month.
   Prince, long used to being coddled and primped, seemed oblivious
to all the attention until Nero grew bold enough to prod him on the
chin. Then he blinked and drew back.
   But neither Nero nor Prince got any lunch from the luncheon at
Sardi's, a prominent midtown Manhattan restaurant.
   Prince, said his agent and master Skip Piazza, ``doesn't have a
very large diet anyway.''

   Here are some comments Wednesday from
candidates for the presidency;
   
   JACK KEMP, who is expected to announce today his withdrawal from
the GOP race: ``There were rumors we would withdraw after Iowa. But
I'm not a quitter. I'm an ex-quarterback, and I don't enter a
contest lightly.''
   
   BOB DOLE, on the importance of next Tuesday's Illinois primary
to the viability of his campaign after his total defeat in the
Super Tuesday Republican primaries and caucuses: ``I've got to win
in Illinois. I feel like I've just taken the finals, and I didn't
flunk but I didn't do too well either.''
   
   GEORGE BUSH, in a telegram to Dole after Super Tuesday's
primaries and caucuses gave him two-thirds of the delegates
necessary to win the GOP nomination: ``I believe it is now time to
look ahead to the issues which distinguish us from the Democrats.''
   
   PAUL SIMON, on why his cash-poor campaign would not run
television advertisements before next week's Illinois primary: ``I
offer Illinois 30 years of service rather than a 30-second
commercial.''
   
   JESSE JACKSON, who captured five states and the most popular
votes in the Super Tuesday Democratic primaries and caucuses: ``We
get stronger every day.''
   
   ALBERT GORE, on his electability: ``I'm not going to say that
any of our candidates are unelectable. But I have the best chance.''
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, on Gore as his primary rival: ``I'm not so sure
he's a major contender. A guy from Massachusetts beat him in Texas,
beat him in Florida.''
   
   PAT ROBERTSON, who had said he would win the South but won only
the Washington state caucuses in the 20-state Super Tuesday
contests: ``It isn't over yet.''

<HEAD>Tibetans Clash With Police, 16 Injured</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DILIP GANGULY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Wtiter</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police clashed today with 200 Tibetan
refugees who tried to march to the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi,
and seven Tibetans and nine policemen were injured, authorities
said.
   The refugees gathered near the Parliament House and chanted
``China, stop killing Tibetans'' in a rally commemorating the 29th
anniversary of the abortive uprising against Chinese rule in Lhasa,
Tibet's capital.
   Police intervened when the crowd surged toward a police
barricade to attempt a march to the Chinese Embassy.
   ``We were not only stopped, but badly beaten,'' said Tashi
Namgyal, secretary-general of the Tibetan Youth Congress. ``The
policemen poked bamboo sticks and hit us on our heads.''
   It was on March 10, 1959, that Tibetans rose in revolt against
the Chinese Red Army that invaded Tibet in 1949. China claims the
region was part of China since the 13th century. Tibetans dispute
that claim.
   After the uprising, the Dalai Lama, spiritual and temporal
leader of the Tibetans, and 100,000 of his followers fled to India.
The Tibetan god-king has since maintained exile headquarters in
Dharmasala in northern India.
   In a statement issued today from Dharamsala, the Dalai Lama
called on Tibetans to ``honor the courage of our brethren in Tibet
who have taken to the streets to draw attention to their suffering
under Chinese colonial rule.''
   ``It is indeed a sad reflection of the state of the world that
violence seems to be required for the international community to
pay attention.''
   He was referring to a clash in Lhasa last Saturday which left as
many as five Tibetans and three police dead.
   The rally site in New Delhi was strewn with stones, shoes,
sandals and sticks after the clash with police. The Chinese Embassy
in the nearby diplomatic district was cordoned off.
   Police accused the Tibetans of starting trouble.
   ``For no reason the Tibetans became violent and started hurling
rocks at us,'' said police officer Shanti Kumar Jain. ``We had to
stop them.''
   It was the second rally by Tibetans in New Delhi this week. On
Monday, hundreds of Tibetans held a demonstration and chanted ``We
shall overcome.'' They were prevented Monday from marching on the
Chinese Embassy.

<HEAD>Arms Agency Reports US Could Verify Soviet INF Compliance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Without knowing the exact size of the Soviet
arsenal, the U.S. intelligence community could effectively verify
Soviet compliance with the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces
treaty, according to a classified report by the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency.
   The Washington Post reported today that the ACDA study, which
was sent Tuesday to members of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee said, the pact's ``verification measures posed
significant risks for the Soviets of U.S. detection'' even though
``U.S. intelligence cannot achieve a total count'' of Soviet
medium-range and shorter-range nuclear-armed missiles and lauchers
that are to be eliminated under the agreement.
   The Post said the ACDA report seemed to answer criticisms by
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and others who maintain that Soviet
compliance with the INF treaty cannot be verified because the U.S.
intelligence community is uncertain about how many SS20
medium-range missiles the Soviets have.
   The report also said that U.S. officials have assumed ``Soviet
declarations for total numbers, locations, and characteristics of
their treaty-limited items could be false'' so they would not be
used to verify Soviet compliance.
   The Soviets said last year they planned to destroy 650 deployed
or stored SS20s but analysts at the Defense Intelligence Agency, an
arm of the Defense Department, have said the Soviets have at least
165 additional SS20s. Helms said this was an indication the Soviets
may have hidden some of the missiles for potential use against U.S.
European alllies.
   The report acknowledge that Soviet retentions of some missiles
couldn't be ruled out but noted that the United States would
scrutinize the destruction of ``all launch-critical equipment'' and
that all test flights would be barred six months after the treaty
takes affect.

   The dollar steadied at higher levels against
nearly all major currencies in light European trading early today.
Gold bullion prices were higher.
   Dealers said the dollar was mostly higher on a technical rebound
and they expected it to remain stable through the day.
   The British pound, which surged earlier this week, eased amid
fears of profit-taking and more pound sales by the Bank of England
to stop sterling rising too sharply.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 128.20 Japanese yen, up from
128.08 at Wednesday's close. Later, in London, the dollar traded at
128.05 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.6708 West German marks, up from 1.6685
   _1.3805 Swiss francs, up from 1.3785
   _5.6622 French francs, up from 5.6485
   _1.8764 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8750
   _1,234.75 Italian lire, up from 1,231.50
   _1.2585 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2532
   In London, the pound fell to $1.8420 from $1.8460 late Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $436 a troy ounce, down
from $436.50 late Wednesday, but rose in later trading. At
midmorning today, the city's five major bullion dealers set a
recommended price of $437.25.
   In Zurich, the noon bid gold price was $437.20, up from $437
late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $438.42 bid, up from
Wednesday's $438.01.
   Silver was quoted in London at $6.33 bid an ounce, up from $6.31
late Wednesday.

   Striking scriptwriters agreed to resume
negotiations today with both sides under a gag order not to
disclose details of the talks, while producers of the Oscar
ceremonies vowed the show must go on.
   The Writers Guild of America went on strike Sunday after
rejecting the latest offer by the Alliance of Motion Picture and
Television Producers. The dispute centered on artistic control of
scripts and money received from reruns.
   Commissioner Leonard Farrell of the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service imposed a gag order on negotiators for both
sides Tuesday, blocking any disclosures about the bargaining.
   ``It's a mediation session and that's all I can say,'' guild
spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden said after the gag order was imposed.
   ``It's not an unusual situation in a strike,'' she said. ``It's
important that those topics on the table be kept there, rather than
be aired in the media.''
   Writers working on the Academy Awards show slated for April 11
said they left its script half written when they walked out. But
producer Samuel Goldwyn Jr. said: ``The show must go on, and it
will.''
   The academy was denied a guild waiver to let writers finish the
show.
   About 125 East Coast scriptwriters picketed outside the MGM
building in New York City on Wednesday. It was the first protest by
the eastern arm of the guild.
   In the Manhattan protest, three writers of ``Late Night with
David Letterman,'' wearing jackets bearing the show's logo, walked
the picket line.
   William Peter Blatty, who wrote ``The Exorcist,'' joined
pickets, as did Screen Actors Guild member Barbara Feldon of ``Get
Smart'' fame.
   ``The union is only as strong as its ability to strike,'' said
marcher John Patrick Shanley, a best original screenplay Oscar
nominee for ``Moonstruck.''

   Some rock climbers at Hueco Tanks State
Historical Park have been gluing stones to the sheer rock walls to
create handholds and footholds, officials say.
   The practice has forced a ban on rock-climbing while officials
survey the damage and decide whether to allow climbers back on the
rocks, Parks and Wildlife Department spokeswoman Suzanne Carter
said Wednesday.
   Hueco Tanks was created to protect prehistoric rock drawings.
The area attracted people as long as 10,000 years ago because of
the water that collects in ``huecos,'' or hollows, in the granite
rock formations.
   The defaced walls were discovered in mid-February and the park
was closed indefinitely on March 1 to technical climbers, who use
ropes, bolts and wedges. Climbers use the equipment at Hueco Tanks
because some of the park's climbing routes are among the most
challenging in North America.
   Bolts are screwed into stone to secure safety ropes. The
practice is banned at Hueco Tanks, but park workers have struck an
unofficial truce with climbers: If climbers don't drill any more
bolts, the existing bolts won't be removed.
   Wedges are placed in cracks and also secure safety ropes. They
are supposed to be removable, but some climbers apparently have
been trying to make the wedges permanent.
   ``They put a wedge in a crack, then they will glue it into place
with the epoxy glue if it's not secure,'' Ms. Carter said.
   Even worse, she said, is evidence that some climbers have glued
rocks to the rock faces to create handholds _ a practice that would
shock most climbers, who take pride in using nothing but chalk on
their hands and soft-rubber-soled shoes to aid their ascents.
   Hueco Tanks is about 25 miles east of El Paso. Its brown cliffs
were created after molten rock intruded into overlying limestone
millions of years ago and the limestone eroded away. Some of the
formations rise 150 feet.

<HEAD>Northwest Says It Will Impose Contract With Flight Attendants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA WILKINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest Airline's decision to impose a
contract on its 6,700 flight attendants has put the airline and the
union on a ``collision course,'' says a Teamsters official.
   The contract that the airline said it will impose April 1 is
substantially the same as the proposal that negotiators fashioned
in talks before the Feb. 26 strike deadline passed, Northwest said
Wednesday.
   ``We're not asking them to accept this. They've already rejected
it. We're putting it into place,'' said Terry Erskine, the
airline's vice president of law and labor relations.
   Erskine said the airline has not talked with the union about its
plan to impose the contract, but he said if attendants decide to
strike, the airline is prepared to hire permanent replacements.
   ``They're on a collision course, and everybody's going to get
hurt,'' William Genoese, director of the Teamsters airline division
and the flight attendants' chief negotiator, told WCCO-TV Wednesday.
   When asked what the chances of a strike next week are, Genoese
said: ``I would say they're pretty close to 100 percent. I would
say unless somebody gets the people to the bargaining table ... the
company's the one that's going to hurt itself.''
   Teamsters have called a strategy meeting Monday in Washington,
D.C., for local union officers and strike captains at Northwest, he
said.
   The main obstacle to reaching a settlement between the airline
and the flight attendants has been disagreement over how to raise
lower-paid B-scale attendants to higher paid A-scale wages.
   Northwest has proposed extending the B-scale from five years to
eight years, meaning lower-wage flight attendants would have to
wait an additional three years before earning top-scale wages,
Erskine said.
   B-scale flight attendants have said the airline is trying to
break a promise that they would earn A-scale wages after five years.
   The union also has objected to two-tier wage agreements, saying
they pit junior workers against senior workers.
   The issue has intensified since Northwest acquired Republic
Airlines in 1986. Roughly one-third of the 2,600 former Republic
attendants work for B-scale wages and the other two-thirds have
said they wouldn't get enough out of Northwest's latest wage offer.
   Under the contract proposal that will be implemented, the
entry-level wage will go from more than $13,000 a year to $15,000 a
year, and the top base wage will go from the current $32,000 up to
$35,000 a year, Erskine said.
   ``Our door, of course, will always be open for further
collective bargaining,'' Erskine said.

   Four Cambodian guerrilla leaders
accused of human rights abuses have been dismissed from their
military posts, a spokesman for the resistance group said today.
   Son Sann, president of the Khmer People's National Liberation
Front, ordered the dismissals of Chea Chhut, Liv Ne, Gen. Dien Del
and Gen. Hing Kunthon in early February, said the spokesman, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The front is one of three major resistance groups fighting
Vietnamese forces in Cambodia. It operates from bases along the
Thai-Cambodian border.
   ``We want to let the people investigate the alleged human rights
abuses, what was done,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   ``Another reason (for the dismissals) is we want to reorganize
and clear up the climate at the border,'' he said. The spokesman
did not specify the alleged abuses.
   In recent years, international aid workers and organizations
like the U.S. Lawyers Committee for Human Rights have accused some
Khmer People's National Liberation Front commanders of dispensing
justice arbitrarily and allowing abuses against Cambodian civilians
and local Thais.
   Some front soldiers also have been arrested by the Thais for
banditry.
   The four officials have been moved to inactive posts and were
replaced by their assistants, the spokesman said. Asked about their
whereabouts, the spokesman said: ``They are surely not at the
border.''

   The national assembly today
unanimously re-elected President Suharto, but a military general
angrily protested the selection process for vice president in which
a Suharto aide is favored.
   The People's Consultative Assembly re-elected Suharto, the only
presidential candidate, to a fifth five-year term. Suharto, 66, has
led the nation of 170 million people since 1967. His re-election
indicates he is in firm control of the island republic and its
400,000-member armed forces.
   The 1,000-member assembly, the nation's highest policy-making
body, meets every five years to choose the president and vice
president and issue new guidelines for state policy.
   State Secretary Sudharmono, one of Suharto's most trusted aides,
was expected to be elected vice president on Friday, the 11th and
final day of the assembly session. Sudharmono, 61, chairs the
governing Golkar party.
   Military sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
army was opposed to Sudharmono's nomination and wanted the newly
appointed armed forces commander, Gen. Try Sutrisno, 52, to fill
the post.
   The opposition Moslem United Development Party nominated its
chairman, Jailani Nario, 59, for vice president.
   Shortly after Suharto's re-election, a military general sprang
to the podium to charge the selection process for vice president
was unfair.
   Brig. Gen. Ibrahim Saleh of the government-nominated military
faction grabbed the microphone at the podium and said:
   ``We Indonesian soldiers who believe in God and defend honesty
and justice, have heard rumors saying that the nomination of the
vice president is not being fairly and correctly carried out.''
   Saleh said, ``There are certain things that we feel are against
our conscience.'' He did not elaborate.
   Saleh was shouted down and later taken away by fellow officers
and Wang Suwandi, secretary-general of the national assembly.
   Later, the commander of the powerful National Security Agency,
Gen. Benny Murdani, told reporters that Saleh's statement did not
represent the official view of the armed forces and that he was
speaking for himself.
   Suharto was not present during the session.
   Suharto came to power following a 1965 communist coup attempt in
which six army generals were killed before the challenge was
smashed by forces he then led as commander of the Army Strategic
Command.
   Suharto is expected to form a new Cabinet later this month that
will have to tackle urgent problems of economic development,
including how to cope with a $42.1 billion foreign debt.
   Indonesia's economy was hit hard in the last five years by
economic recession and a sharp drop in the price of oil, a major
foreign exchange earner. The country has to set aside $6.4 billion
_ nearly a third of its annual budget _ to pay its loan
installments for the fiscal year beginning in April.
   The People's Consultative Assembly is comprised of a 500-member
Parliament and 500 provincial and district officials.
   In elections last April, the Golkar party won 299 seats in
Parliament, which also has 100 government-nominated members from
the military. The Moslem United Development Party has 63 seats and
the Indonesian Democratic Party 38 seats.
   In the assembly, Golkar has 548 seats as well as 151
government-nominated members from the military and 147 from the
provinces. The Moslem United Development Party has 93 and the
Indonesian Democratic Party 61.

<HEAD>Vortex Unlikely As Crash Cause, Witnesses Say</HEAD>

   Experts testifying about possible causes of
a Continental airliner crash did not rule out disturbance from a
plane landing on an adjacent runway, but said winds could have
swept away any such effect.
   ``Turbulent winds lead to the early demise of vortex,'' said
James Hallock, who has studied the air currents caused by plane
landings for the Department of Transportation.
   Hallock testified Wednesday during the second day of a National
Transportation Safety Board hearing into the Nov. 15 crash of
Continental Flight 1713, which killed 28 people and injured 54 at
Denver's Stapleton International Airport.
   George Greene of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Langley Research Center, who also has studied
vortex, agreed that winds generally diminish the effect of such
turbulence.
   Federal Aviation Administration officials tried to elicit from
Greene a definite statement on whether vortex caused the Stapleton
crash. But NTSB board member Joseph T. Nall, chairman of the
inquiry, would not allow him to answer.
   Nall said conclusions about what caused the crash must be made
by the NTSB when it completes its investigation. A final report is
not expected until later this year.
   Continental spokesman Bruce Hicks said the witnesses' testimony
did not mean vortex should be ruled out as a possible cause.
``Nobody shot down anything today,'' he said.
   Earlier Wednesday, an airplane engineer testified that enough
snow fell during the 24 minutes that Continental 1713 awaited
takeoff for ice buildup on the wings to have been a possible factor
in the crash.
   Continental officials said they believe wing icing can be ruled
out as a factor because the plane exceeded the speed at which it
likely would have stalled from ice.
   Ralph Brumby, manager of aerodynamics and acoustics for
McDonnell Douglas Corp., which manufactured the DC-9, said 0.032
inches of precipitation, or about one-third of an inch of snow,
fell in the 24 minutes between de-icing and takeoff.
   If all that snow turned to ice on the wings, the DC-9 could have
stalled after takeoff, Brumby said. Ice can change the shape of a
wing, affecting lift.
   Brumby, under questioning by Continental officials, said that
the amount of precipitation that fell between the time the plane
was de-iced and takeoff was enough to cause the plane to stall at
about 150 knots, or a little more than 170 mph.
   But he said it was impossible to draw a definite conclusion that
ice on the wing was a factor based on the theory that all the snow
had turned to ice.
   ``There are so many open parameters,'' he said. ``We don't know
the amount of roughness generated by the water collection.''
   He also said officials do not know how long the de-icing fluid
was able to prevent buildup before the plane took off.

   At least 19 people were reported killed
in Punjab state today and Wednesday despite government efforts to
give militant Sikhs a freer hand in trying to resolve the region's
problems.
   Sikh gunmen killed three Sikh policemen standing guard outside a
high school where examinations were under way today in the village
of Dari Wala, Amritsar district police chief Mohammed Izhar Alam
said.
   He said the four gunmen, who used Chinese-made AK-47 assault
rifles, arrived and fled on a tractor.
   Two people were killed in the village of Mehsampura early today
when Sikh gunmen sprayed the sleeping village with gunfire, the
United News of India reported. The identity of the victims was not
immediately available.
   Dari Wala and Mehsampura are near the town of Mehta, about 25
miles east of Amritsar.
   On Wednesday, seven people were killed by Sikh extremists in the
Amritsar district. Seven other deaths were reported in the state,
including police slayings of two suspected extremists in shootouts.
   The deaths came as militant Sikhs on Wednesday installed Jasbir
Singh Rode as chief priest at the Golden Temple in Amritsar,
Sikhism's holiest shrine.
   On Friday, the government released Rode, who had been held since
1985 on accusations of sedition but never tried. On Sunday, the
government said it was dissolving the Punjab state assembly, which
had been controlled by a moderate Sikh party.
   Both moves were seen as an effort by Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi's administration to try to involve militant leaders in
bringing an end to the increasing violence in Punjab state.
   The latest killings raised to at least 417 the number of people
killed in attacks blamed on Sikh extremists since the start of the
year.
   Last year, more than 1,000 people died in Sikh attacks in the
state.
   Most of the victims have been Hindus or moderate Sikhs.
   Sikhs, whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam, claim they are discriminated
against by India's majority Hindus. Sikhs make up less than 2
percent of India's population, but are a majority in Punjab. Hindus
are more than 80 percent.
   Sikh extremists have been agitating for more political autonomy
or an independent state since 1982.

<TEXT>
   Joseph Franceschi, a Socialist deputy in the
National Assembly and former secretary of state for public
security, died today after a long illness, the Socialist Federation
announced. He was 64.
   Franceschi, a close friend of President Francois Mitterrand,
died about 7 a.m. at his home in Alfortville southeast of Paris. He
had been hospitalized for the past month. The federation said he
died after a ``long and cruel illness,'' without adding further
details.
   Franceschi held three Cabinet posts under Mitterrand.
   The first was as secretary of state for the elderly. In August
1982, he was named secretary of state for public security. After
two years, he returned to the post of secretary of state for
retired persons and the elderly, which he held until the Socialists
lost power in March 1986.
   Franceschi was born Jan. 15, 1924 in Tunis, Tunisia and had a
degree in letters and a doctorate in political science. He became
mayor of Alfortville in 1965 and was elected a deputy in the
National Assembly on the Socialist ticket in 1973, serving as a
vice president of the Assembly in 1977-78.
   The funeral was scheduled for Saturday at the Notre Dame church
in Alfortville.

<TEXT>
   A political opposition leader who
was ordered freed after four months in prison was arrested again as
he was headed home, his wife and police said today.
   Karpal Singh was released Wednesday after a court ruled that one
of the charges used in his original arrest was erroneous. Singh is
vice president of the opposition Democratic Action Party and a
member of Parliament.
   The party condemned the rearrest ``in the strongest terms
possible.''
   A statement issued by party Deputy Secretary General Lee Lam
Thye said the action shows the disregard the executive arm of the
government has for the judiciary.
   Karpal and his wife, Gurmit Kaur, were traveling home from Ipoh
after his release when police stopped their car at a roadblock and
arrested Karpal, Kaur said.
   She said they were stopped near Nibong Tebal, a village near
Karpal's hometown of Penang. Penang is 180 miles northwest of Kuala
Lumpur.
   ``Later at the Penang police station I was told that he was
being detained under the Internal Security Act,'' Kaur said in a
telephone interview.
   A police spokesman at the Federal Police Headquarters today
confirmed the arrest.
   Karpal originally was arrested under the Internal Security Act
on Oct. 27, together with the leader of the opposition in
Parliament, Lim Kit Siang, and others. The act allows imprisonment
without trial.
   The National News Agency Bernama said the regional High Court in
Ipoh, 120 miles north of Kuala Lumpur, found earlier Wednesday that
the detention order was made without care, caution and a proper
sense of responsibility.
   Karpal was one of 119 people detained under the Internal
Security Act between October and December, government officials
said. The act allows imprisonment without trial.
   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has said the arrests were
necessary to prevent Malay-Chinese racial clashes.
   On Tuesday, Deputy Home Affairs Minister Megat Junid Megat Ayub
told Parliament that 86 people were still being held under the act.

   The author of a letter from Democrats on the
House Judiciary Committee calling for the temporary resignation of
Attorney General Edwin Meese III said today there is ``considerable
sentiment'' for even harsher action against Meese.
   A Republican on the committee, however, called the letter ``an
outrageous political move,'' and a Meese spokesman said the
attorney general would not comply.
   Meanwhile, Swiss oilman Bruce Rappaport has testified under oath
before independent counsel James McKay in the criminal
investigation involving Meese and a proposed $1 billion Iraqi
pipeline project, according to sources familiar with the probe.
   Eleven Democrats on the Judiciary Committee called Wednesday for
Meese to step down until that and other independent counsel
investigations into Meese's conduct are completed.
   Rep. Edward Feighan of Ohio, who was introduced as the letter's
author on ``CBS This Morning'', said the committee members did not
specifically consider impeachment of Meese, but ``there was
considerable sentiment for even harsher action than the letter we
sent.'' He did not say what other steps might be taken.
   Feighan said that although no Republicans on the committee
signed the letter, Meese had become a ``major embarrassment'' to
his party. He also said morale was low in the Justice Department
which Meese heads.
   Rep. William McCollum, R-Fla., also interviewed on CBS, noted
that Meese has been cleared every time he has been investigated.
   ``This is an outrageous political move on the part of some
Democrats in a political year,'' he said. McCollum denied that
morale was low in the Justice Department.
   ``The pervasive perception that you have allowed personal
considerations to encroach on your constitutional responsibilities
threatens to breed contempt for your office, your administration
and the rule of law itself,'' the letter said.
   Justice Department spokesman Terry Eastland said the letter
proposed ``a politically partisan idea and a thoroughly bad idea.''
   He said Meese ``has every intention of serving to the end of
this term. He has spent some time with his lawyers on the
investigation, but there has been no serious subtraction of his
time or effort from leadership of the Department of Justice.''
   McKay and his deputy, Carole Bruce, took the statements from
Rappaport in London on Tuesday, said the sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity. McKay has granted immunity from prosecution
to Rappaport.
   Meese's former chief of staff, John Richardson, who left the
Justice Department several months ago, also testified separately
Tuesday afternoon before the federal grand jury in Washington which
is receiving evidence from McKay's office.
   Richardson, who has joined a Richmond, Va., law firm, declined
on Wednesday to discuss his testimony.
   The independent counsel is investigating whether Meese may have
violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act which prohibits paying
bribes to foreign officials by U.S. companies and authorizes the
attorney general to intervene to block them.
   The investigation stems from a 1985 memo to the attorney general
from his longtime friend, E. Robert Wallach, who had been hired as
legal counsel by Rappaport to help secure U.S. support on the
pipeline project.
   Wallach's memo says that payments were planned to the Israeli
Labor Party in connection with the pipeline. Rappaport, a partner
in the proposed pipeline, has denied that any such payments to the
Labor Party were contemplated.
   Meese has said he doesn't recall reading the portion of the memo
mentioning planned payments to the Labor Party.
   Rappaport was brought into the project because of his close ties
to then-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres to aid in getting
assurances for the Iraqi government that Israel would not attack
the pipeline.
   The pipeline was never built but was to have been constructed by
the San Francisco-based Bechtel Group Inc.
   McKay's investigation of Meese which began last May 11, has
delved into Meese's involvement with scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp.
and the regional Bell telephone companies as well as with the
pipeline project.

   The Moscow Circus rolled out dancing bears and
jugglers to announce that it is scheduling its first North American
tour in 10 years.
   Company representatives, appearing at Radio City Music Hall on
Wednesday, said the famous Soviet circus will open in Toronto on
Aug. 15 and end their 15-city tour in San Francisco on Jan. 1. The
200 shows will include 44 performances at Radio City between Sept.
12 and Oct. 9.
   The circus acts expected include a dozen dancing bears, 17
acrobatic tigers and a quadruple somersault by the Cranes aerialist
troupe.
   The troupe has not appeared in North America since 1978, with
U.S.-Soviet cultural exchanges frozen after the 1979 Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan.

<HEAD>Study Finds Anti-Cancer Drug Relieves Asthma</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Low doses of an anti-cancer drug may help people
with severe asthma reduce their need for harmful amounts of
cortisone, a study published today suggests.
   Despite the promising results, however, experts cautioned that
more study is needed to test the long-term effects of the therapy
before it is used routinely.
   In the study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine,
doctors gave the drug methotrexate to 14 people with severe
bronchial asthma. While they took the drug, they were able to
reduce their use of prednisone, an artificial form of cortisone, by
36 percent.
   An estimated 5 percent to 7 percent of Americans have asthma. A
small minority of these people require daily doses of steroid drugs
so they can breathe. Prednisone is among the most common of these
medications.
   However, long-term use of high doses of prednisone can lead to
obesity, cataracts and weakening of the bones, among other things.
   Dr. Michael F. Mullarkey of Virginia Mason Clinic in Seattle
tested methotrexate as an alternative to prednisone for relieving
inflammation, an underlying cause of asthma.
   They found preliminary evidence that methotrexate works. But
they cautioned, ``Longer and larger studies are needed to define
the ultimate benefits and risks associated with the use of
methotrexate in severe asthma.''
   In an accompanying editorial, Drs. Gary R. Cott and Reuben M.
Cherniack of the University of Colorado agreed with that warning.
   ``Many questions remain to be answered before low-dose
methotrexate therapy should be considered as more than an
experimental form of treatment for steroid-dependent asthma,'' they
wrote.
   The Seattle doctors stopped their study earlier than planned
because of the dramatic effects of treatment with methotrexate.
Nine patients continued to take methotrexate after the study was
formally halted and four of them have completely stopped taking
prednisone.
   Four patients suffered mild nausea for several hours after
taking methotrexate. This problem went away within a few weeks in
all but one of them.
   Besides its use in cancer treatment, methotrexate also is given
to psoriasis and arthritis sufferers.

   Three men in a flatbed truck today smashed through
steel barricades blocking Glienicker Bridge in Communist East
Germany and roared over the ``bridge of spies'' into West Berlin,
police said.
   The dramatic escape across the bridge made famous by numerous
East-West spy exchanges over the years occurred shortly before
dawn, said a West Berlin police spokesman.
   Police at the scene said the 7{-ton truck was loaded with empty
propane gas tanks in an attempt to discourage border guards from
firing their weapons.
   The East German border police apparently did not open fire, and
the three men fled uninjured, said a police spokesman, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The truck crashed through two steel gates and an electrified
fence on the East German side, raced across the bridge and smashed
through another control gate in West Berlin, police said.
   Glienicker Bridge connects Potsdam, East Germany with West
Berlin. Potsdam is on Berlin's southwest outskirts.
   The three men _ two of them age 37 and the other 27 _ then
reported to West Berlin police.
   Among the most famous swaps on Glienicker Bridge was the Feb.
10, 1962 exchange by the United States of convicted Soviet KGB
master spy Col. Rudolph Abel for Francis Gary Powers, whose U-2
surveillance plane was shot down over the Soviet Union.

<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jack Lemmon, who will be honored
tonight by the American Film Institute with a Life Achievement
Award, says luck helped him win good parts and fear helped bring
out his best performances.
   Lemmon, 63, landed starring roles in his debut appearances on
stage, in film, and on television.
   ``There's a tremendous boost in playing a lead, especially in a
first job,'' Lemmon said, ``because slips of confidence are built
into an actor's life. You go from thinking you will never work
again to thinking you're the greatest young actor in America.''
   After graduating from Harvard College, Lemmon started in
television in ``The Arrival of Kitty.'' From there, his lead role
in a Broadway revival of ``Room Service'' led to his starring
performance in the film ``It Should Happen To You.'' He was only 29.
   Lemmon, talking in his Beverly Hills office this week as he
prepared his acceptance speech for the AFI award, said a successful
acting career depends on making the most of every opportunity.
   ``The very reason we are sitting here talking is that I was able
to deliver,'' the two-time Oscar winner said. ``But first the doors
had to open. I had to get the part.''
   After the luck of the draw decides casting, fear takes over,
Lemmon said.
   ``I think you do better work if you're afraid,'' he said.
   Lemmon won Academy Awards in 1955 and 1973. He was honored first
for Best Supporting Actor in ``Mister Roberts,'' then received a
Best Actor Oscar for ``Save the Tiger.''

<HEAD>Alcatraz Casino Plan Put on San Francisco Ballot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A measure designed to put a gambling casino
on Alcatraz Island, once the site of a federal prison that housed
some of the nation's most notorious criminals, has been approved
for the city ballot.
   ``I'd never turn my back on something that would bring money to
the city legally,'' said Supervisor Wendy Nelder, one of six city
supervisors who voted Wednesday to put the advisory measure on the
June 7 ballot.
   The measure asks whether the city should encourage changes in
state and federal law to allow a gambling resort on Alcatraz, for
29 years a prison for for 1,576 criminals who included Al Capone
and George ``Machine Gun'' Kelly.
   The prison that was dubbed ``The Rock'' was closed in 1963 when
Attorney General Robert Kennedy called the facility inhumane.
   It isn't the first time a casino has been suggested for the
island.
   In 1969, more than 300 recommendations were submitted to Mayor
Joseph Alioto about the future of the island in San Francisco Bay.
   Suggestions included a casino, a home for hippies and a site for
a replica of the Eiffel Tower. Alioto favored a giant monument
symbolizing ``Justice'' on the outcropping a mile off Fisherman's
Wharf that would be a West Coast counterpart to the Statue of
Liberty in the New York harbor.
   The latest casino plan stemmed from a luncheon meeting Tuesday
of labor leaders, city supervisors and Warren Hinckle, a San
Francisco Examiner columnist who made an unsuccesful bid for mayor.
   The casino complex could bring in at least $150 million a year
to help San Francisco solve a projected budget deficit, said
Hinckle, whose plan would include a tunnel under the bay to the
casinos.
   The state constitution would need to be changed by voters to
exempt the island from state laws that forbid gambling, Hinckle
said.
   The federal government would also have to be petitioned to
remove Alcatraz from the Golden Gate Recreation Area, which covers
vast stretches of federal open space on both sides of the Golden
Gate Bridge. Federal officials would then have to sell the island
to San Francisco.
   Hundreds of tourists visit Alcatraz each year for a guided tour
of the island that is conducted by park rangers.

   A man with a criminal record that would have
barred him as a foster parent and his wife were ordered held
without bail today on charges of shaking their 2-year-old foster
son to death, authorities said.
   Walter ``Sonny'' Hairston, 26, and his wife, Maryanne, 33, were
arraigned early this morning on charges of murder and involuntary
manslaughter in connection with the death of Joey Huot, said bail
commissioner Garnita Selby.
   Hairston also was charged with providing false background
information on foster placement applications, Ms. Selby said.
   Hairston pleaded guilty in 1981 to charges of rape, aggravated
assault and burglary in Washington County, but social workers did
not know of his record when Joey was placed with the couple,
authorities said.
   The boy was placed in the couple's home by Catholic Social
Services under a contract with Philadelphia's Department of Human
Services.
   Since January 1987, 18 children who had been under the care of
the city department have died of suspected abuse or neglect.
   The alleged falsifications on Hairston's foster-parent
applications prevented caseworkers from identifying him as a former
criminal, a source in the state's child welfare system told The
Philadelphia Inquirer. The source said Catholic Social Services had
checked with state police and the state's registry of reported
child abusers, as required, but Hairston was cleared.
   Catholic Social Services spokeswoman Ursula O'Reilly declined to
comment on the agency's background checks because of the legal
proceedings.
   Joey died on Jan. 27 at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia
after he was declared brain-dead and his mother gave doctors
permission to take him off a respirator.
   The Hairstons were arrested at their home Wednesday morning,
police said.
   Police said the Hairstons told them Joey was injured when he
fell from a couch during an apparent epileptic seizure.

   A cargo plane flying erratically dove into
a residential area, struck a garage and a house and exploded early
today, killing a couple in the house and the pilot, officials said.
   The couple's three children, who were sleeping in an upstairs
bedroom, were unhurt and were led to safety by neighbors, said
Herbert Kauffman, assistant police chief for this Detroit suburb.
   The twin-engine Beechcraft plane had just taken off from Detroit
City Airport, not the city's main airport, about 12:30 a.m. when it
went into a nosedive and struck a garage, propelling a van into the
first-floor bedroom of the house next door before crashing into
that house and bursting into flames, said police Lt. Orba Underwood.
   ``There are parts of the aircraft and car inside the bedroom,''
Underwood said.
   ``The plane was seen faltering in the air by two Warren scout
cars, and they were literally on the scene immediately after
impact,'' Mayor Ron Bonkowski said. ``They thought at first he
might have hit the school playground on the other street. You look
another 60 feet, and he'd have been in the street.''
   Kauffman said police officers Craig Garwood and Alex Sywak saw
the airplane shortly before it crashed.
   ``The aircraft appeared to be flying lower than normal and was
ascending and descending erratically.'' Kauffman said, quoting a
report by the officers. ``It disappeared out of sight, and seconds
later they saw a fire flash.''
   Kauffman identified the victims as Norma and Harold Richardson,
both 29. Their neighbor whose garage was struck was unharmed, but
her house was damaged by flames.
   The airplane, loaded with automobile axles, was flying from
Detroit to Fort Wayne, Ind., Kauffman said. It crashed about five
miles northwest of City Airport, which is northeast of downtown
Detroit. The pilot, Thomas Bussard of Pontiac, was the only person
aboard.
   Kauffman said officials at Lafayette Aviation at the
Oakland-Pontiac Airport confirmed the airplane was theirs. A man
who did not identify himself answered the telephone at the company
and declined comment.
   It took firefighters about 45 minutes to put out the blaze that
engulfed the two-story house and damaged the one-story house and
garage next door in this Macomb County community, Bonkowski said.
   Doug Stockel ran across the street and was met at the front door
by another neighbor, who kicked down the front door.
   ``The kids were already downstairs screaming. He took the kids
out, I checked the upstairs. Somebody had to go upstairs to make
sure there was nobody up there,'' Stockel said.
   ``As I'm thinking about it, with the gas mains in back, that
house could have exploded right there. We could have opened that
front door and the flames could have nailed us,'' Stockel said.
``The thing is, that was only done on an impulse.''
   The children _ Randi, 9; Erin, 5, and Debra, 4 _ were taken to
grandparents in Warren.
   Don Hunt said he was in his house two doors away from the
victims' home when he heard the explosion.
   ``We were just getting ready for bed,'' he said. ``One minute I
hear a real loud roar coming in like a low-flying plane and then
real fast ... this is too loud, this is too low. And crash and
flames and everything. So you could tell right away it was a plane.
   ``At first I thought it could have been a helicopter going by,
like a police helicopter, but then it was the wrong kind of sound.
It was coming in too fast, like something dropping fast.''
   Kauffman said the area surrounding the crash site was sealed off
and officials from the Federal Aviation Administration and the
National Transportation Safety Board were at the scene
investigating.

<HEAD>Iraq Offers to End Missile Duel After Firing 50th Into Tehran</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with statement from Hussein
offering to end missile duel. No pickup.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Iraq fired its 50th long-range missile
into Tehran today and then Iraqi President Saddam Hussein offered
to halt the deadly missile duel if Iran did the same.
   But he warned in a Baghdad Radio broadcast, monitored in
Nicosia, that Iraq will go on pounding Iranian cities with missiles
if Iran continues to hit population centers, launch ground
offensives or attack ``any Arab city.''
   Iran said some civilians were killed in the latest attacks. Iraq
fired two long-range missiles into the Iranian capital, raising to
50 the number it claims to have shot into Tehran in 11 days.
   Iran claims to have fired 25 missiles into Baghdad and other
Iraqi cities in the same period.
   The latest Iraqi bombardment was in retaliation for an overnight
Iranian artillery attack on the southern Iraqi cities of Basra and
Qurna, Baghdad's official Iraqi News Agency reported.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said ``a number of civilians''
were killed in Basra and Qurna, which is 40 miles north of Basra.
   Hussein's statement, read by an unidentified military spokesman,
followed a joint meeting in Baghdad of the ruling Revolutionary
Command Council and the regional command of the Arab Baath
Socialist Party, at which Saddam presided.
   It said the Iraqi bombardment of Tehran and other Iranian cities
would halt at 4 p.m. Friday if the Iranians stop firing.
   The statement charged that Tehran triggered the latest flare-up
in the ``war of the cities'' by hitting Baghdad with two missiles
Feb.29.
   ``So the last bombardment should be Iraq's before the cease-fire
goes into effect,'' the statement said.
   There was no immediate response from Tehran, which has appealed
to the United Nations and other world bodies to force Iraq to halt
the bombardment.
   Hundreds of civilians on both sides have been killed or wounded
in the missile duel, the first time Tehran has been hit by
long-range surface-to-surface weapons since the Iran-Iraq war broke
out in September 1980.
   ``If the enemy Iranian regime attacks any of our cities with
missiles, warplanes or artillery in retaliation for the last Iraqi
bombardment, we will continue attacking and teach the rulers of
Tehran the appropriate lessons,'' the Iraqi statement said.
   It said that if the Iranians launched any new ground assaults,
``we shall retaliate ... by attacking all Iranian cities ... with
all means.''
   The Iraqis have been braced for weeks for a major Iranian
offensive in the southern sector of the battlefront, where Tehran
has been massing troops.
   The Iranians have also been attacking in the mountainous
northern sector for several weeks.
   The Iraqi statement called on the U.N. Security Council to
impose sanctions, including an arms embargo, on Iran for failing to
comply with the council's July 20 cease-fire resolution.
   Earlier, Tehran Radio reported that Iraqi warplanes bombed the
central city of Isfahan, former capital of ancient Persia, hitting
a mosque and a school and killing or wounding some children.
   The radio reported other air raids on Hamadan, Arak, Dezful,
Shustar, Shahr-e Kord and Burujerd in western Iran. It claimed one
Iraqi jet was shot down by anti-aircraft fire over Arak. Baghdad
denied losing any planes.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said the Iraqi
missiles hit residential areas of Tehran. It said a number of
civilians were killed or wounded, but it gave no figures.
   IRNA also said Iranian fighter-bombers attacked Iraqi military
positions and economic targets in Basra and Al-Amarah, further
north, in three raids today. It said Iran inficted ``heavy
casualties and damage.''
   Iranian authorities say at least 157 civilians have been killed
and more than 420 wounded in missile attacks on Tehran alone in the
past 11 days.
   Iraq has not given any casualty figures.
   In Basra, women vowed to have more babies to help their
country's war effort, the Iraqi News Agency said. It said the women
promised Hussein to ``increase reproduction'' in response to his
call for bigger families last November.

<HEAD>Leader of Police Unit Says He was Drunk At Time Of Killings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A police squad leader accused
by fellow officers of ordering the execution of a black youth
testified that he was drunk at the time and had assaulted the
victim.
   Warrant Officer Leon De Villers, 36, concluded his testimony
Wednesday after six days on the stand during a trial that began in
October.
   The trial is unusual because it focuses on testimony by
policemen against their fellow officers. Five members of the
all-white, 10-member unit have alleged that De Villiers and his
codefendant, Constable David Goosen, were responsible for the
execution and a fatal stabbing that occurred a few hours earlier.
De Villiers and Goosen are charged with murder in both deaths.
   According to the five officers, Goosen stabbed one black man,
Andile Plaatjie, 45, during an unauthorized foot patrol and later
shot 18-year-old Mlungisi Stuurman in the head after being told by
De Villiers that the badly beaten youth should be ``taken out.''
   De Villiers and Goosen contended that Stuurman was shot
accidentally after being taken to a riverside to wash off blood
from injuries inflicted when officers assaulted him.
   De Villiers testified that he had drunk most of a bottle of
brandy shortly before his unit's two forays into the black section
of the Cape Province town of Cradock in July 26, 1986. Other
members of the unit also drank heavily, according to testimony, and
engaged in a blood-oath ceremony in which they swore to keep
secrets.
   De Villiers said he was too drunk to accompany his men during
the predawn foot patrol, when the stabbing allegedly occurred.
   During the second foray, De Villiers said, he lost his temper
because Stuurman refused to answer questions, hit the youth and
then stood by as other members of the unit beat and kicked him.
   De Villiers said he decided not to report the subsequent
shooting of Stuurman because he was ``shocked'' and under the
influence of alcohol.
   He said he could not explain why, if the shooting was
accidental, five members of the unit alleged it was deliberate.
   In separate developments:
   _ The New Nation, a black-oriented weekly newspaper, reported
Thursday that a black activist was abducted from his home near
Johannesburg by eight white soldiers last month, taken to a
cemetery, and interrogated while lying on a grave with a gun
pressed to his neck. Police and military spokesmen said the
allegation was under investigation.
   _ A Johannesburg police sergeant on trial for murder testified
Wednesday that he was ordered by his co-defendant, a police
captain, to kill three men last year. Two of the men were shot dead
and one was injured.
   Sgt. Robert van der Merwe said he carried out the assignment
after Capt. Jack la Grange told him the three targets were working
for the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement.
Testimony in the trial has indicated the murders were related to
drug smuggling and had no connection to the ANC.

   Gallaudet University's new president, told by
an influential congressman she may have no choice but to step down,
said today she will meet with instructors and students who oppose
her appointment as the head of the nation's only university for the
deaf.
   The congressman, Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., said he told Dr.
Elisabeth Zinser, the school's new president, on Wednesday that
federal aid for the school may be jeopardized if she refuses to
leave the post.
   ``There's a variety of scenarios and that's one,'' Bonior told
The Washington Post afterward. ``I prefer that she make the
decision through a period of meeting with students and faculty and
arrive at a decision that's best for the university.''
   Zinser later acknowledged to an interviewer that ``a very strong
signal is being sent to me to resign, but I'm not sure that's
uniform.''
   Her selection has been opposed by students, instructors and
alumni who contend it is time for Gallaudet to have a deaf
president. Zinser hears normally and does not know sign language.
   Interviewed today on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,'' Zinser
said ``my deepest concern is to see the university continue its
good work and get back to educating students and carrying out its
research mission.''
   ``Today is the day in which I'm going to attempt to establish
the communication that is needed with the students and the faculty.
... My concern at this stage is that as president of the
university, that I exercise the leadership to get the university
back to business and engaged in the good work that it is doing.''
   But such talks are doomed, said the president of the National
Association for the Deaf.
   Gary Olsen, himself a graduate of Gallaudet, said on the ABC-TV
program that ``there's no way there will be an open dialogue
amongst the faculty, staff and students with her. ... If she wants
business to continue, then she should really be honest about it and
back down.''
   The appointment of Zinser, who has been chanceollor of the
University of North Carolina at Greensboro, was announced Sunday
night. Protests closed the university Monday; boycotts left
classrooms empty Tuesday and Wednesday.
   Protest leaders had said they were considering a mass student
withdrawal today. But one leader, Tim Rarus, said this morning,
``''We've decided not to do that. We would lose our leverage.''
   One deaf student said the protests recall the classic civil
rights demonstrations of the 1960s.
   ``This is the Selma of the deaf,'' Gallaudet graduate student
Kathy Karcher said at a rally Wednesday, referring to the Alabama
city where civil rights demonstrators were bloodied by
club-wielding police 23 years ago. ``This is a very important
moment.''
   Protest leaders say demonstrations will continue until Zinser is
replaced. They are also demanding the replacement of Jane Bassett
Spilman, the chairwoman of the board of trustees, and the
implementation of a plan to make deaf people a majority on the
school's 20-member board of trustees. The board has just four deaf
members.
   The Gallaudet protesters have encountered none of the violence
of the Selma demonstrators, but they say their struggle is akin to
the trials endured by blacks in their fight for equality.
   On Wednesday, more than half of Gallaudet's 274-member faculty
attended a meeting and voted overwhelmingly to ask the school's
board of trustees to oust Spilman. The faculty group also endorsed
the students' demands.
   ``Those are the people I think who are really deaf,'' deaf
actress Marlee Matlin said on ``Nightline,'' referring to
Gallaudet's board of trustees. Matlin won a 1986 Academy Award for
her performance as a dropout from a school for the deaf in
``Children of a Lesser God.''
   Gallaudet was founded by an act of Congress in 1864, and
receives three-quarters of its $76 million annual budget in federal
funds.

<HEAD>Events Still Obscure Despite New Details</HEAD>

   Investigators in the Tawana Brawley case have
uncovered new details about events during the four days she claims
she was abducted and sexually abused, but they are still uncertain
exactly what happened, according to a report published today.
   In a related development, child protection officials are
investigating whether Miss Brawley's welfare has been endangered
since she was whisked into seclusion by the Rev. Al Sharpton,
according to another report.
   Miss Brawley, who was 15 at the time she disappeared for four
days starting last Nov. 24, has said she was held in a wooded area
and sexually abused by at least two and as many as six white men,
one of whom flashed a police-type badge. She was found in a plastic
bag with racial slurs scrawled on her body and smeared with animal
feces.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo appointed Robert Abrams, state attorney
general, as special prosecutor. But Sharpton and Miss Brawley's
attorneys, C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox, have withheld her
cooperation from the investigators.
   Today's New York Times reported that interviews with witnesses
indicated that:
   _ Miss Brawley made an abrupt decision to get off a bus near her
home in Wappingers Falls, which apparently ruled out the
possibility that someone deliberately ambushed her.
   _ Investigators found traces of marijuana and hashish in an
apartment near where she was found and that her family had recently
been evicted from. The denim jacket she was wearing when she
disappeared was also found there and had traces of the drugs in it.
But tests performed on Miss Brawley showed no signs of drug use.
   _ Just before she was found, her mother went into the apartment
to look for her. Although she found no one, she said she suspected
someone had been there because the heat was turned on. A local
investigator who entered the apartment described it as
``blisteringly hot.''
   _ A charcoal substance that might have been used to write racial
slurs on Miss Brawley's body was found on leather gloves underneath
the garbage bag.
   _ Dog feces were found inside and outside her clothing,
suggesting to investigators that she might have been naked when
they got on her. The yard of the apartment was littered with such
feces.
   In addition, more evidence has surfaced indicating that Miss
Brawley spent at least part of the four days around the apartment,
according to the Times.
   On Wednesday, child protection officials began investigating
whether Miss Brawley has suffered ``emotional and educational''
neglect, insufficient psychiatric and medical care and inadequate
supervision, according to a report in today's Daily News.
   A ``possible neglect'' complaint was filed last week by
79-year-old Conrad Lynn, chief counsel of the Mid-Hudson region of
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
Wappingers Falls is 50 miles north of New York City.
   But Matthew Strong, Miss Brawley's uncle and legal guardian,
said Miss Brawley is receiving the care she needs.
   ``She's going to school and she's in therapy,'' said the
Monticello police officer.

   A woman who apparently was part of a crowd
that grabbed more than $700,000 that fell from an armored truck has
had a change of heart and turned in $28,000, police said.
   ``She said she picked up the money and then got kind of scared,
so she decided to turn it in,'' Sgt. William Herndon said late
Wednesday.
   The woman, identified only as a 30-year-old postal worker, gave
police two clear plastic bags containing a total of $28,000
Wednesday, more than 24 hours after a crate filled with money fell
from the back of a Loomis Armored Inc. truck.
   However, most of the estimated $771,000 that was in the crate is
still missing, and police warned opportunists they could face
felony theft charges if they don't return the cash.
   The woman, who may have been the one seen throwing money bags
into her car and driving away, could be charged with failure to
return property to its lawful owner, a misdemeanor, Herndon said.
She was interviewed by police.
   Since talking with the woman, police think more people than they
originally believed were involved snatched the estimated 20 bags
still missing. On Tuesday, they thought only three to five people
took advantage of Loomis' misfortune.
   ``She did say ... there were so many people picking up sacks
that she didn't believe it,'' Herndon said. ``It makes sense,
because when we interviewed people at the scene, no one knew
anything.''
   One man at the scene, television repairman Luis Lopez, managed
to save two bags containing $20,050 each and took them straight to
Loomis' nearby offices.
   Investigators were working to trace license plate numbers and
vehicle descriptions reported by witnesses and trying to compile a
list of the lost bills' serial numbers.
   A spokesman for Oakland-based Loomis declined comment on the
incident.
   The armored truck, carrying more than $1.7 million collected
from 20 banks in the San Francisco Bay area, was headed for Loomis'
offices from downtown.
   Lt. Barry Johnson said the driver claimed the rear door had been
locked, but that a dolly containing a crate of bills slammed
against the door and forced it open.
   The driver, whose name was not disclosed, did not learn of the
mishap until a honking motorist pointed it out two blocks away.
Police described him as ``white as a ghost and real upset.''
   Before the driver could return, a crowd gathered around the
fallen bags. Some people put money back into the crate but others
hung onto it, including one man who witnesses said tossed numerous
bags into his pickup truck and drove off.
   Police declined to be specific Wednesday about the amount
involved, saying only that it was more than $500,000. The San
Francisco Examiner reported that $771,000 in $10, $20 and $50 bills
fell out of the truck while close to $1 million remained inside.

<TEXT>
   Security forces in Sao Tome and Principe
shot and killed a suspected American mercenary and captured another
in an aborted coup in the West African nation, the head of the
national news agency said today.
   A South African official denied earlier reports that his country
was involved in the coup attempt in Sao Tome and Principe, a
Marxist-ruled island nation off the coast of Gabon.
   STP-Press director Manuel Dende told reporters in the Angolan
capital of Luanda one of two foreign mercenaries presumed to be
American was killed when the invaders attacked the central police
station in Sao Tome, the capital, early Tuesday. He said the other
was captured by government troops.
   Authorities in the two-island nation say two armed raiders were
killed, one wounded and 43 captured after they landed on beaches
close to Sao Tome in an abortive attempt to overthrow the
government of President Manuel Pinto da Costa. A policeman also was
wounded.
   Dende did not provide any further information on the suspected
American mercenaries.
   He told Angolan reporters the leader of the invading force,
indentified as the head of a Sao Tome opposition group, was among
those captured, along with mercenaries from several other African
countries. He said the vessel used to drop the raiders in fishing
boats also was seized.
   He said the coup leader was Afonso dos Santos, head of a group
calling itself the Liberators of Sao Tome and Principe. Angolan
television, radio and newspaper reports quoted unidentified
official sources as saying the invading force may have been landed
close to the islands by South Africans.
   The South African Foreign Affairs Deparment's director for West
Africa said that South Africa was ``absolutely and categorically
not involved.''
   Reports have appeared recently in West European newspapers about
the presence of South Africans in Equatorial Guinea, about 180
miles north of the island of Sao Tome.
   In Lisbon, Portugal, a Sao Tome government opponent said dos
Santos was a former colonel in the Portuguese colonial army who led
an opposition movement based in Walvis Bay, a South African enclave
on the coast of South-West Africa.
   Johannesburg's Sunday Star newspaper last May quoted ``a report
circulating in Lisbon'' that up to 90 Sao Tome refugees who arrived
in Walvis Bay seeking political asylum a year before were being
trained to launch an armed revolt against their government.
   The South African government immediately denied the report and
said it was trying to find a country which would accept the
refugees. They reportedly have been held in custody for the past
year as illegal immigrants.
   The Citizen, a pro-government Johannesburg newspaper, quoted a
Roman Catholic priest in Walvis Bay as saying 74 of the refugees
were still in the enclave, 1,750 miles south of Sao Tome and
Principe.
   Dende quoted military authorities as saying the capture of most
of the invading party ``might not have been possible without the
help of the people of the island.'' Earlier reports said fishermen
alerted authorities about four armed men, believed to be on
reconnaissance for the coup attempt, two weeks previously.
   In recent months, Pinto da Costa has called on government
opponents to return from exile. Wooed by U.S. and West European
aid, he has also unveiled plans to allow small private companies to
operate within the state-controlled economy.
   The president also has announced plans to hold the first general
elections since the country gained independence from Portugal in
1975. His Sao Tome and Principe Liberation Movement has ruled as
the country's only political party since then.

   Soldiers shot and wounded
three Palestinians today in a pre-dawn riot that Arabs said was
started by Jewish settlers who shot at Arab homes and vandalized
their cars.
   Jewish settlers said the clash began after they were awakened by
Arab rioters shouting ``Slaughter the Jews!'' and ``God is great!''
Fearing the Arabs wanted to attack their homes, some settlers said
they rushed into the streets of Hebron and fired warning shots.
   The army said the violence by Arabs was aimed only at the
military.
   Arab residents said they were awakened at about midnight by
carloads of settlers raiding their neighborhoods.
   ``All the city was sleeping, nobody was in the streets,''
Mustafa Natsche, the former mayor, told The Associated Press. ``It
was a dreadful night. There was a sort of battle under the windows
of my house, shooting, crying, moaning.''
   He said the Arabs responded to the attack by throwing rocks at
the settlers and Israeli troops who arrived.
   But Rabbi Moshe Levinger told the AP, ``They (the Arabs) ran
down near the synagogue. They wanted to enter Jewish homes. They
carried stones. We responded by throwing stones and firing in the
air.''
   The area military commander disputed Levinger's claim.
   ``It's important to stress that the riots were directed at the
army, and at no stage was there an intention or attempt to attack
Jewish homes,'' the commander said on Israel radio. He did not give
his name, in keeping with military regulations.
   An AP reporter saw dozens of vandalized Arab cars, including a
station wagon with all its windows broken. Arab residents showed
several revolver cartridges they collected after the clash and said
they turned over nearly 100 to the Israeli authorities as evidence.
   Levinger, who has lived in Hebron nine years, is one of the
founders of the 40-family Beit Hadassah settlement inside the
predominantly Arab city of 50,000. There is a second Jewish enclave
in Hebron, the hillside neighborhood of Tel Rumayda.
   Levinger claimed 500 Arabs were involved in the rioting and came
to within about 100 yards of Jewish homes,. He said about 50
settlers defended the homes.
   ``If we hadn't stopped them ... there would have been a
slaughter of Jews, men, women and children,'' Levinger said.
   But Natsche and other Arab witnesses said the clashes occured
without provocation in Arab neighborhoods several miles from Jewish
homes.
   Natsche pointed to the smashed windows and slit tires of his car
parked outside his home, about one mile from the Jewish settlements.
   Army spokesmen said 20 to 30 Arabs were involved in each of
three disturbances in Hebron. They said the Arabs erected stone
barricades, set tires ablaze and threw rocks.
   According to the army account, the unrest began about 11 p.m.
Wednesday and lasted until about 3 a.m. At one point, a jeep with
soldiers was trapped by the rioters, the army said.
   ``In the course of the riots, the lives of the soldiers were
endangered, and they were forced to shoot,'' the area commander
said.
   Three Arabs were lightly wounded in the legs by army gunfire,
and two women were taken to a hospital suffering the effects of
tear gas, he said.
   The army said one Arab car was set ablaze, but that the unrest
was instigated by Palestinian rioters, not Jewish settlers.
   The Arab-run Palestine Press Service said Israelis from the
nearby Kiryat Arba settlement started to smash car windows about
midnight and Arab residents went outside to see what was happening.
The first Arabs to go outside were beaten by settlers, said the
agency.
   On Wednesday, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the army's
efforts to curb three months of Palestinian unrest have been
hampered by the presence of Jewish settlements in the occupied
lands.
   Also Wednesday, the 10-member inner Cabinet refused to endorse a
U.S. peace plan designed to end the violence in which at least 87
Palestinians have been killed since Dec. 8.
   Rabin, speaking on Israel Television, said the presence of
Jewish settlers made it difficult for Israeli soldiers to put down
the unrest.
   ``The problem could have been simpler if the whole territory was
Arab, without Jewish settlements. It would have been very easy to
close it and not to deal with the problem of roads,'' he said.

<HEAD>Navy Withdraws Support From ``Supercarrier'' Series</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy has pulled the plug on helping
production of the ABC-TV ``Supercarrier'' series, saying the show
inaccurately portrays the lives of the crew and officers on a
fictional aircraft carrier.
   ``After lengthy deliberations the Navy determined that the
scripts for `Supercarrier' did not accurately portray the Navy and
its people; therefore cooperation was withdrawn,'' a Navy spokesman
said.
   Navy officials declined to comment on specific plot summaries
that prompted concern, but one reportedly involved a tale about
gun-running military action in Central America.
   Navy spokesman Capt. Michael Sherman said ABC could regain the
Navy's support if future scripts are in line with Navy interests.
   Show producer Charles Fries said, ``I think they're in a
wait-and-see mode.''
   The show, likened to the movie ``Top Gun'' with its hard rock
sound track and F-14 jet fighters, premiered Sunday with a
90-minute movie and took a 13.0 rating and 19 percent audience
share. It will be broadcast at 8 p.m. Sundays over the next seven
weeks.
   Fries said the show at first was planned to focus on the lives
of the men and women aboard the carrier, but then shifted to
action-adventure.
   ``From that point on, the Navy became more and more disenchanted
because essentially they're concerned about their perception (by
the public,)'' he said.
   ``Right now, the Navy is in a peacetime mode ... but to do an
action-adventure show we had to get off the carrier and bring in
some conflict and jeopardy.''
   Two episodes remain to be shot, and Fries said he had ample
shipboard footage left to continue production without Navy help.
   The Navy charged Fries' company $50,000 for the use of Navy
personnel, planes and facilities for the scenes that have been shot
so far.
   The show is loosely based on the best-selling non-fiction book
of the same name by George Wilson, a Washington Post reporter.
   ``I was kind of distressed that they didn't get it a little more
realistic in terms of what really goes on out there,'' said Wilson,
who said one admiral told him: ``You ought to sue ABC for not
plagiarizing your book.''

   Doctors used a laser in clearing a
woman's clogged coronary artery but cautioned that there was no
evidence that the beam of energy cleared away the fatty despoits.
   ``We put a fiber down there, we gave it energy and we did it
safely,'' Dr. Leonard Nordstrom said Wednesday of the procedure
performed at Methodist Hospital.
   Doctors performed the procedure Tuesday on a 38-year-old woman
whose right coronary artery was 90 percent clogged.
   ``I don't want to overstate what we've done,'' Nordstrom
stressed at a news conference. ``I think in cases to come we'll
have good documentation that we have removed tissue.''
   Nordstrom said he stopped the non-surgical laser procedure and
inflated a balloon to enlarge the vessel opening before there was
evidence that the laser had removed any tissue clogging the artery.
   Lasers have been used previously during open-heart surgery, he
said. Janis Konze said she had no second thoughts about being the
first patient to undergo the new procedure.
   ``Everything went fine,'' said Konze, who said she first
experienced heart pain last summer and consulted with a doctor
about a month ago.
   ``I feel wonderful. I'm anxious to go home,'' Konze said before
her release Wednesday. ``I expect to be back to work within a
week.''
   In the procedure, a specially-designed catheter or slender tube
is inserted into a patient's arterial system and guided to a
position in the coronary artery where a direct beam of laser energy
is directed at the blockage.
   Then the catheter is moved forward to position the balloon in
the newly enlarged opening. The physician inflates the balloon and
spreads the remaining blockage apart to re-open circulation through
the artery.
   The hourlong procedure, during which Nordstrom used one-second
bursts of laser energy for two to three minutes, was the first
coronary application of the system developed by GV Medical Inc., of
Plymouth.
   GV's LASTAC system is the first integrated system that combines
the use of direct laser energy, fiberoptics and balloon angioplasty
catheters, the company said.
   The procedure was pioneered on larger leg arteries. More than
130 procedures have been performed on leg arteries since May 1986
and the system is now in use at 17 sites around the world, GV said
in a statement.
   With the leg arteries, ``the initial success rate was better
than 90 percent, with a success percentage rate in the mid 70s on
keeping the vessels open,'' James Grabek, GV president and chief
executive officer, told reporters.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has given permission for
10 test coronary procedures to be done, Nordstrom said. Findings
from these clinical studies will be reviewed by the FDA before
approval is granted for additional procedures, or for procedures to
be done at other sites, he said.

<TEXT>
   The former girlfriend of the leader of
the right-wing group The Order testified that she helped him
distribute $2 million of $3.6 million stolen in an armored car
robbery in California in June 1984.
   Zillah Craig said Wednesday that she also helped Robert Mathews,
killed in a December 1984 shootout with FBI agents on Whidbey
Island near Seattle, pass counterfeit bills.
   Craig testified Wednesday in the sedition-conspiracy trial of 14
men. Ten of them are charged with sedition, five are accused of
conspiring to kill a federal judge and an FBI agent, and two are
accused of interstate transportation of stolen money.
   Craig said that in August 1984 she and Mathews traveled to
Cohoctah, Mich., where they spent the night with defendant Robert
Miles, head of the Mountain Church. She said Mathews took a
briefcase with him to a meeting with Miles that lasted several
hours.
   Craig said she and Mathews also met in Arlington, Va., with
William Pierce, head of the National Alliance, a reputed white
supremacist organization.
   Pierce is the author of ``The Turner Diaries,'' a book that
government witnesses have testified formed the basis for The
Order's plans to overthrow the government and establish an
all-white nation in the Northwest.
   Miles gave Mathews a letter of introduction to Glenn Miller,
head of the White Patriots Party in North Carolina, she said. She
and Mathews visited Miller at his home and gave him about $25,000
to $30,000, she testified.
   Miller, who recently agreed to appear at the trial as a
prosecution witness, is to testify this week.
   Craig testified that she gave birth to Mathews' baby, a girl,
about two months before Mathews was killed in the shootout with FBI
agents. Shortly after Mathews' death, she said, Miles began sending
her money with the notation ``Widows and children aid fund.''
   She also testified that after visiting defendant Richard Scutari
in federal prison at Memphis in October 1986, she relayed to Miles
a message from Scutari that he feared James Ellison would cooperate
with federal agents.
   Ellison, former leader of the Arkansas-based survivalist group,
the Covenent, the Sword and the Arm of the Lord, did testify for
three days two weeks ago. He's considered the prosecution's star
witness in the case.
   In other developments, defendant Bruce Pierce said Wednesday he
had changed his mind about his statement Tuesday that he would
plead guilty to conspiring to overthrow the government.
   U.S. District Judge Morris Arnold ruled Tuesday that Pierce had
voluntarily confessed to FBI agents shortly after his March 1985
arrest in Georgia; that statement prompted Pierce to announce his
guilty plea.
   Pierce contended that he was coerced into confessing, claiming
that authorities told him that his wife would be arrested and his
three children placed in foster homes in he did not talk to the FBI.
   Pierce, 34, is serving 100 years for racketeering and 150 years
for violating the civil rights of outspoken Jewish radio talk show
host Alan Berg, who was shot to death in Denver.

   A judge says he sentenced two rabbis and the
wife of one of the men to prison because they ``reaped millions''
as part of a $130 million garment industry tax fraud in which more
than 200 companies participated.
   But U.S. District Judge John M. Walker said Wednesday he took
into account a lengthy appeal for leniency by lawyers for the three
defendants, all members of the ultra-religious Lubavitch sect of
Judaism and active in their Brooklyn community.
   The three were convicted Dec. 4 of one count of conspiracy and
44 counts of aiding and assisting the filing of false federal tax
returns.
   Rabbi Schnejer Zalman Gurary, 76, who Walker called the
``kingpin'' of the scheme, was sentenced to three years in prison
and five years on probation, and was fined $2 million.
   ``You reaped millions,'' Walker told him. The sentence would
have been stiffer, but for Gurary's failing health and a thick file
of letters attesting to Gurary's good community deeds, Walker said.
   Gurary's son-in-law, Nochum Sternberg, 43, was sentenced to 18
months in prison and five years on probation. His wife, Esther
Sternberg, 43, Gurary's daughter, was sentenced to 120 days in jail
and five years on probation.
   The Sternbergs also were fined $1 million.
   They faced up to five years on the conspiracy count and three
years in prison on each of the 44 aiding and assisting counts.
   The Sternbergs have 11 children, four of whom still live at
home, and Walker said Sternberg was not to begin serving his prison
sentence until his wife had completed hers.
   The judge also accommodated the woman's strong religious beliefs
by allowing her to leave jail each week for the Jewish Sabbath.
   During the six-week trial, the government said the scheme
involved phony invoices from a group of 36 companies known
collectively as the ``Zalga companies.''
   The defendants sold phony Zalga invoices, primarily to companies
in the garment center, indicating that goods had been purchased
when in fact no goods were involved.
   The garment company would then issue a check to the Zalga
company issuing the phony invoice. The defendants then returned
cash to the company, keeping 10 percent to 15 percent of the amount
of the check as a commission.
   Representatives of the other companies, a number of whom
testified against the three, were sentenced earlier on various tax
fraud charges.
   According to trial testimony, the defendants issued more than
$130 million in fraudulent invoices to more than 200 companies
between 1979 and 1986.

   A Lyndon LaRouche associate says he will assume
the traditional duties of Harris County Democratic Party chairman,
the office he won in an upset.
   Party leaders, meanwhile, said Wednesday they are taking steps
to thwart Claude Jones' influence.
   Jones, an associate of the political extremist, threw the
Democratic party into turmoil Tuesday when he narrowly defeated
incumbent Larry Veselka in the primary. Jones received 54,394
votes, or 51.46 percent, to Veselka's 51,318 votes, or 48.55
percent.
   The result shocked party leaders who face working under a
chairman associated since 1975 with a fringe presidential candidate
strongly opposed by the national and state party.
   Members of the party's steering committee met Wednesday night to
consider a plan by which the party executive committee would
empower the party secretary to run the party rather than Jones, who
takes office May 2. The 664-member executive committee is made up
of elected precinct chairmen.
   Former county party chairman Barbara Stanley, who attended the
meeting, said state law places most of the party's power with the
committee rather than the chairman, who has no inherent power.
   Party leaders won't challenge Jones' right to hold the office,
she said, adding she presumes they will not try to stop him from
conducting three legally required county party executive committee
meetings during his term.
   Jones said he desires to work with the party, help register
voters and defeat the Republicans, particularly George Bush, whom
he described as the likely nominee.
   LaRouche associate Harley Schlanger, appearing with Jones,
asked, ``Do the leaders of the Democratic Party have a right to
tell the voters who their party chairman will be?''
   Jones dismissed as ``a silly question'' an inquiry about
analysts' views that Jones' common name and the obscurity of the
race accounted for his win.
   He won, he said, because he has ``been working hard pushing
LaRouche's issues, and those issues finally hit a nerve.''
   Democratic National Committee member Billie Carr of Houston said
Jones was elected because the voters didn't know of his association
with LaRouche. She said she doesn't blame Veselka, who didn't
campaign for re-election and was out of the city in the weeks
before the campaign.
   Jones, who was defeated by Veselka in 1986, said his sole
occupation is working for LaRouche. He said he staffs solicitation
booths the LaRouche organization sponsors at airports and other
public places.
   Jones said he will back the Democratic presidential nominee
although he supports LaRouche.
   LaRouche has accused Queen Elizabeth of drug trafficking and
espouses a quarantine of AIDS patients.
   One person happy about the flap was Texas Republican Chairman
George Strake.
   ``I wish them (the Democrats) every success under their new
leadership,'' he said Wednesday.

<HEAD>Contras Release U.S. Witness For Peace Volunteer, Group Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Contra rebels have released an American
volunteer worker for Witness for Peace after holding him for 10
days in northern Nicaragua, a spokesman for the organization said
today.
   Dennis Marker, Washington director for the group, said Richard
Boren, 30, was released to other Witness for Peace volunteers
Wednesday evening near the remote town of Quilali.
   Witness for Peace opposes Contra military aid and documents
human rights abuses in Nicaragua.
   Boren and 11 Nicaraguans were captured March 1 in Mancotal,
about 25 miles from where he was released and 75 miles north of
Managua. All but one of the Nicaraguan captives had escaped and
returned to their villages and the other may have been released
with Boren, Marker said.
   He said the volunteers still had to travel through the remote
region where Contra ambushes are frequent but were expected to
arrive in Managua sometime this evening.
   ``He is still in an area that is often under Contra attack,''
said Marker, ``so we do not yet consider him safe.''
   Based on radio transmissions from the volunteers to other
Witness for Peace workers in Managua, Marker said, the only thing
he knew about Boren's condition was that he has a cold. He said
that, depending on his condition, Boren plans to hold a news
conference in Managua on Friday.
   Marker said the group had conducted a nationwide phone-in
campaign Wednesday to the State Department demanding that U.S.
officials tell the Contras to release Boren immediately.
   Betsy Cripes, Witness for Peace executive director at its
headquarters in Durham, N.C., also said Boren had been released.
   ``We just found out ourselves,'' Ms. Cripes said. ``It'll take
several hours to drive there (to Managua),'' she said.
   A Contra spokesman in Miami said he could not confirm the
report, and there was no immediate word from the State Department.
   The Contras earlier had said the American was being ``detained.''
   On Monday, a spokesman for the State Department said Contra
leaders in Washington and Florida had agreed to release Boren as
soon as the rebels could do so safely in front of reliable
witnesses.
   Boren had been working in Jinotega in northern Nicaragua since
November, documenting Contra activity for Witness for Peace, the
group said. Ms. Cripes said he would return to North Carolina by
Monday.

   Three intelligence operatives said FBI and CIA
officials asked them to infiltrate the political organizations of
extremist Lyndon LaRouche, a declassified document shows.
   The document was made available Wednesday to defense lawyers in
the fraud and conspiracy trial of LaRouche, six aides and five of
his political groups.
   The defense, which claims the criminal charges emerged from a
White House-directed plot to ruin LaRouche, won a delay in the
trial as a result of the document and a previously disclosed memo
indicating two key players in the Iran-Contra scandal discussed
collecting evidence against LaRouche.
   A federal judge ordered the prosecutor to search government
files for any additional evidence that should be surrendered to
defense lawyers.
   In a separate decision, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday
that NBC must surrender to a judge outtakes from a 100-minute
interview with a former LaRouche consultant who said an aide to the
political extremist discussed a plot to assassinate Henry
Kissinger. The network broadcast a one-minute excerpt of the
interview in April 1986.
   The decision Wednesday by the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld a lower court order that videotape of the entire interview
must be surrendered for possible use at the conspiracy and fraud
trial.
   The court also upheld a contempt citation against the network.
   NBC had contended that surrendering portions of the interview
that were not broadcast violated its First Amendment right against
judicial intrusion into news gathering and editorial decisions.
   However, U.S. District Judge Robert E. Keeton ruled that the
rights of the defendants to have access to the 100-minute interview
with Forrest Lee Fick outweighed those of the network.
   The prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney John Markham, has at
times ridiculed defense claims that LaRouche was a target of
infiltration by the FBI and the CIA, which is prohibited by law
from spying domestically. The defense claims Marine Lt. Col. Oliver
North, the former National Security Council aide fired for his role
in the Iran-Contra affair, directed the infiltration because
LaRouche refused to support the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Defense attorneys are seeking dismissal of charges on the ground
that prosecutors deliberately withheld evidence that the defense
later learned of through Freedom of Information Act requests.
   The FBI document declassified Wednesday refers to Gary Howard
and Ron Tucker, founders of a private, now-defunct Dallas company,
Peregrine International Associates.
   Peregrine reportedly was involved in an aborted attempt to sell
arms to Iranians who planned to assassinate their nation's leader,
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and helped train Contra forces and
elite military units in El Salvador, Honduras and Peru.
   The document also refers to retired Sgt. Maj. Fred Lewis, who
defense lawyers in the LaRouche case say also worked for Peregrine.
   ``When asked about their possible ties to LaRouche, they
(Howard, Tucker and Lewis) claimed they had previously been
requested by the FBI and CIA to penetrate the LaRouche
organization,'' said the document.
   Lewis, a former member of the Army's elite special operations
Delta Force, was said by the FBI document to be an employee of
Rhyolite Management Systems of Dallas. Rhyolite is the name of a
spy satellite, the government acknowledged several years ago.
   A memo to North from retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord,
one of North's main operatives in the private network to aid the
Contras, said ``our man here claims Lewis has collected information
against LaRouche.''
   The defense lawyers said they have been informed by the
government that the ``our man'' reference is to Oliver Revell, an
FBI assistant director involved in counterintelligence.
   FBI spokesman Ray McElhaney said the agency would not comment on
the memo during the trial.
   ``This was an activity that was headed up by Oliver North and
Mr. Secord in a political attempt to stop the LaRouche people,''
defense attorney Michael Reilly said Wednesday.
   Tucker, a former Texas Department of Public Safety Narcotics
Agent, and Howard, a former border patrol agent, claim in a lawsuit
filed last summer against the Customs Service that they have been
government informants since 1979. Tucker and Howard are seeking
$1.4 million for their expenses in a sting operation that led to
the arrest of a man allegedly buying arms for Iran.
   They say the government backed off the case because it would
have revealed the Reagan administration's arms shipments to Iran
and the diversion of profits to the Contras.
   The FBI document also said that during interviews with FBI
agents in San Antonio and El Paso, Tucker and Howard said they had
approached family and friends of Soviet dissidents Andrei Sakharov
and his wife, Yelena Bonner, and told the family they could free
the couple from the Soviet Union for $2 million.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa today
accused the Polish government of violating union rights for denying
him a passport to attend an international labor meeting in
Australia.
   The leader of the outlawed federation of labor unions said the
government had so far ignored his request to attend the meeting
March 14-18, according to Solidarity spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz.
Walesa said he was convinced his request was being denied, given
recent political statements by the government.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said two weeks ago that
Solidarity shouldn't be allowed to send delegations abroad because
it has been outlawed.
   Walesa, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983, had asked to go
to the meeting of the International Confederation of Free Trade
Unions in Melbourne with three aides.
   He said today that some Solidarity representatives would attend
the congress despite the government's action, but he did not
elaborate. Solidarity operates an external office in Belgium.
   The passport's denial has drawn criticism from Australian Prime
Minister Bob Hawke and prompted trade unionists briefly to block
mail delivery and garbage removal at the Polish embassy.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Bob Kerrey officially entered the
race for the U.S. Senate today, telling 300 supporters he expected
a tougher campaign than six years ago when he was elected governor
in his first try for public office.
   ``I would like to be your next senator,'' Kerrey said in
starting a two-day swing through the state. ``I can promise you I
will never betray you. And I will never dishonor the respect I have
for you.''
   Kerrey, 44, ended months of speculation last November when he
said he would run for the Senate. He has been criss-crossing
Nebraska since then, saying his main issues are trade policy, the
federal budget, education and agriculture.
   ``A great and glorious future will not happen unless we do the
unglamorous work today,'' he said.
   No other Democrat has filed for the nomination. Sen. David
Karnes, appointed to succeed the late Democratic Sen. Edward
Zorinsky, and Rep. Hal Daub are seeking the GOP nomination.
   Kerrey was a political unknown when he began his campaign for
governor in December 1981; he upset incumbent Republican Charles
Thone in 1982.
   A Medal of Honor winner who lost part of his right leg while
serving with the Navy in the Vietnam War, Kerrey was a popular
governor in mostly Republican Nebraska. He made headlines for his
romance with actress Debra Winger, who visited Nebraska frequently
but later married actor Timothy Hutton.
   Kerrey's announcement in October 1985 that he wouldn't seek a
second term shocked many Nebraskans, but Kerrey said it was ``time
to move on.''
   Since leaving office, he has been involved in various business
ventures, including a restaurant chain and an investment banking
firm.
   He also taught a class on the Vietnam War at the University of
California at Santa Barbara and high school government classes in
Omaha.

<TEXT>
   This week Austria marks the 50th
anniversary of Anschluss, its annexation by Nazi Germany, with
soul-searching events likened by some to an exorcism.
   The disclosure of President Kurt Waldheim's World War II service
in the German army has coincided with a historical reckoning that
forced many Austrians to confront the Nazi past they tried for
decades to forget.
   ``Nobody wanted to talk about the past,'' prominent Austrian
writer Gerhard Roth said in an interview. ``Waldheim forced it. If
Waldheim hadn't come along, this never would have happened.''
   ``There is a kind of exorcism going on at the moment,'' said
Roth, who has written extensively about Austrian society for
publications in his homeland and West Germany.
   ``It brings up a lot of filth with it, but it is basically a
cleansing process,'' Roth said, acknowledging there have been
outbursts of anti-Semitism since the Waldheim controversy came to
light two years ago.
   Waldheim, interviewed on NBC's ``Today,'' said Austria never
tried to ignore its Nazi past but rather concentrated on rebuilding
the nation after the war.
   ``This debate is right now coming on in connection with the 50th
anniversary of that tragedy,'' he said, insisting again that he was
innocent of war crimes.
   Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said the debate over Waldheim should
not distract Austrians from the lessons to be learned from the past.
   ``What we have to do is to think harder about the roots, the
political and societal roots, of what happened in the 1930s, which
ended up in the tragic and dramatic events of 1938,'' he said.
   The leader of Vienna's Jewish community, the city's Socialist
mayor and former concentration camp inmates were expected at the
formal opening tonight of the ``Gedenktage,'' or days of
remembrance.
   Events culminate Friday with a memorial in parliament and
another ceremony at the former imperial Hofburg palace.
   Roth said many thousands of Austrians of the war generation,
together with postwar babies educated by unrepentant Nazis,
absorbed National Socialist teachings that went unchallenged for
decades.
   Now, the nation is beginning to work the past out of its system.
Dozens of plays, films, seminars, exhibits, books and a major
television series are confronting Austrians with rarely viewed
pages of their history.
   Recurring images of throngs cheering Adolf Hitler or crowds
ogling Jews scrubbing Vienna sidewalks contrast with many
Austrians' view that their country was more a victim of Hitler than
an accomplice.
   A highly praised, prime-time television series takes Austrians
back through the turbulent years from 1918 to 1938, when the small
alpine nation struggled to come to terms with the loss of the
Hapsburg empire.
   At Vienna's Austrian Film Museum, long lines form for tickets to
a three-week series of documentary films showing the days of the
Nazi Anschluss, the brutality of World War II and the horrors of
the concentration camps.
   The Burgtheater, Austria's most prestigious stage, is presenting
anti-Nazi plays, including one by Bertolt Brecht and a mock ``Mein
Kampf'' by Hungarian-born Georg Tabori, to mark the Nazi takeover
in March 1938.
   In Graz, a city that hoisted the Nazi swastika on its Town Hall
before Hitler even sent in his troops, an extensive exhibit probes
what happened in the town 50 years ago.
   In Linz, the city of Hitler's youth that welcomed him as a
returning hero in 1938, city fathers will mark the anniversary with
a visit to the nearby former concentration camp of Mauthausen to
honor Nazi victims.
   Another exhibit is being held in Salzburg, and two Vienna
museums have exhibits tracing the history of the city's Jews, a
thriving intellectual community of 200,000 before the war and now
numbering just 6,000.
   The Austrian students' union, representing 170,000 students,
received $833,000 from Chancellor Franz Vranitzky's office to
finance a program to confront people born in the 1960s with a past
most of their parents and grandparents rarely discussed.
   The controversy over Waldheim's wartime past plagued both
events, forcing Waldheim to drop plans to speak at Friday's
ceremonies. Instead, he delivered an address on television.
   Waldheim's inability to play a leading part in events marking
the Anschluss illustrates the deep division among Austrians over
both the president and the nation's past.
   As Austrians mull over their history, debate has intensified
over a historians' report that questioned Waldheim's integrity.
   The report, published Feb. 9, said he covered up his service as
a lieutenant with the German army in the Balkans, where he knew
about Nazi atrocities and did nothing to prevent them.
   The report and Waldheim's calm initial response that ``knowledge
is not a crime'' and that he was not a war criminal has triggered
fierce debate throughout Austria.
   Barely a television program goes by without some reference to
the controversy or to its damaging effect on Austria's image
abroad. Many people say the divisions caused by Waldheim are an
uncomfortably close reminder of the splits among Socialists, Nazis
and Austrian Fascists 50 years ago.
   Roth, who is in his mid-40s, likens the soul-searching to the
aftermath of a nuclear disaster.
   ``It's as if we had this Chernobyl in 1938,'' he said. ``The
dust settled, and slowly we forgot about whether it was radioactive.
   ``Waldheim is like a big geiger counter we brought out to
measure the strength of the emissions, and now we have to think how
to get rid of the nuclear waste we've discovered.''

<HEAD>Oil and Gas Reserves May be Less than Thought</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Geological Survey has sharply reduced
its estimates of how much oil and gas remain to be found in the
United States.
   The new figures were provided to scientists at a meeting in
Denver last week, while a detailed analysis is expected to be made
public sometime next month, explained Ozzie Girard, the survey's
deputy assistant director for engineering geology.
   The survey now estimates reserves of undiscovered crude oil at
33.4 billion barrels, well below the 54.6 billion estimated in a
1981 study.
   In addition, the agency has lowered its estimates of the
nation's reserves of undiscovered natural gas at 254 trillion cubic
feet, down from the previous estimate of 426.8 trillion.
   Girard said today that the figures issued in Denver were
preliminary, and the survey is preparing reports that will detail
its findings by region and will also explain the methods used to
arrive at the nunber and the assumptions made by the scientists
involved.
   The new figures, termed working papers by Girard, are based on a
two-year study looking at drilling results in the last few years.
   There are two main reasons for the lower estimates. One, of
course, is that some previously undiscovered oil and gas fields
have now been found.
   In addition, however, unsuccessful drilling efforts in some
areas that had been thought to be promising have caused scientists
to lower their expectations for new finds, officials said.

<HEAD>Judge Gives PTL Breathing Room in Reorganization Effort</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals judge has temporarily
halted attempts by the Internal Revenue Service to revoke the
tax-exempt status of PTL, the evangelical empire founded by Jim
Bakker.
   In an order filed late Wednesday in Richmond, Va., 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals Judge William Wilkins stayed a lower court
ruling revoking PTL's tax exemption. Wilkins set a March 31 hearing
in Greenville, S.C., where lawyers for PTL are expected to argue
that loss of its tax-exempt status would be a death blow to the
organization.
   Wilkins' stay gives PTL breathing room as it tries to meet a May
1 deadline to reorganize itself with a new tax exemption under the
protection of the federal bankruptcy court.
   ``We see this as being pivotal to the preservation of PTL as we
know it,'' said one PTL attorney who spoke on condition he was not
identified.
   PTL has debts of more than $60 million and is trying to raise
about $4 million by May 2. Revocation of its tax-exempt status,
which it has enjoyed since 1973, could frighten away thousands of
people who might contribute to PTL, the lawyer said.
   The matter reached Wilkins on appeal from a Monday order by U.S.
District Judge Karen Henderson. Ms. Henderson ruled that the IRS
could revoke PTL's tax-exempt status, overturning a December order
by a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge.
   ``If it is subsequently determined that the District Court
incorrectly reversed the Bankruptcy Court, there is a great
likelihood that PTL and those having a financial interest in it
will suffer irreparable injury,'' Wilkins wrote.
   The IRS wants to revoke PTL's status retroactively to 1981 and
has said it would seek at least $55.7 million in back taxes.
   In effect, the IRS has suggested that former PTL leader Bakker
wasn't running a ministry but a profitable business for himself,
relatives and friends.

<HEAD>Japan's Trade Surplus Declines In February</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: A version on financial wires.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Japan's unadjusted trade surplus fell in February
from a year ago, the Finance Ministry reported today.
   The ministry said foreign sales exceeded foreign purchases by
$5.24 billion last month, compared with a surplus of $7.13 billion
in February 1987.
   The February surplus was up $3.08 billion from January, but the
ministry said trade usually dwindles in January because of the long
new year holiday.
   Imports shot up 48 percent from a year ago to a record $14.96
billion in February, while exports rose 17.2 percent to $20.2
billion. The previous high for imports was $14.76 billion in
December 1987.
   Japan's surplus in trade with the United States fell to $3.40
billion from $3.97 billion in February 1987. Exports rose 9.7
percent to $6.81 billion dollars, while U.S. imports soared by 51.9
percent to a record $3.41 billion.
   U.S. aircraft purchases accounted for a large portion in the
imports, totaling $477.86 million, up 194.2 percent from a year
earlier.
   The previous monthly high for U.S. imports was $3.12 billion set
in June 1986.

<HEAD>Experimental Malaria Vaccine Shows Promise in Human Tests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists reported encouraging results today in
the first human tests of an experimental vaccine that fights a
malaria-causing parasite at the stage when it infects red blood
cells.
   Studies in young men found that the experimental inoculation
delayed or suppressed the development of the disease, Colombian
scientists reported in today's issue of the British journal Nature.
   Last year, other scientists reported partial success for a
malaria vaccine that attacks the parasite at an earlier stage, when
it is injected by mosquito bites.
   While malaria is not a major disease in the United States, it
strikes an estimated 300 million people each year worldwide.
   The Colombian scientists said their human work followed
experimental success in monkeys that were injected with the malaria
parasite, called Plasmodium falciparum.
   They experimented in humans with two proteins to spur the immune
system to raise defenses against the parasite in its blood-cell
stage. Nine volunteers were injected two or three times with one or
the other, while four more were given no inoculation.
   The volunteers were also injected with red blood cells infected
with the malaria parasite.
   Three of the five volunteers who got one protein had mild
infections, but with a steady decrease in parasite counts and total
recovery by three weeks. Another showed no protection, and the
fifth left the study early.
   Two of the four volunteers vaccinated with the other protein
showed partial control of the infection for about two weeks, but
then the infection progressed and they were cured with drugs. The
other two who got that protein showed no protection.

<TEXT>
   President Kurt Waldheim, commemorating
Austria's annexation by Germany 50 years ago, today apologized for
the crimes committed by Austrian Nazis but ignored his own
controversial wartime past.
   ``We must not forget that many of the worst Nazi hangmen were
Austrians,'' Waldheim said in a televised speech. ``There were
Austrians who were victims and others who were perpetrators.
   ``Obviously, there is no collective guilt'' for the war crimes
committed by Austrians, the president declared. ``Nevertheless, as
head of state of the Republic of Austria, I wish to apologize for
Nazi crimes committed by Austrians.''
   It was the first time that Waldheim has used such language in
public to acknowledge Austria's share in World War II and the
Holocaust.
   Waldheim did not acknowledge until two years ago that he served
in World War II in a German army unit implicated in wartime
atrocities, and he has resisted pressure to resign since it became
known.
   In his speech, the president insisted that ``as a state, Austria
was Hitler's first victim. That is indisputable.''
   Austria was wiped off the map when Nazi troops invaded on March
11, 1938. Adolf Hitler then returned in triumph to Austria, his
native land, cheered by hundreds of thousands of countrymen.
   In April 1938, the Nazis said 99 percent of Austrians approved
the Anschluss in a nationwide vote. More than half a million
Austrians joined the Nazi party, and many of the brutal guards in
the concentration camps were Austrians.
   Austria's Nazi past _ largely suppressed here over the past four
decades _ has dogged this neutral country since the disclosure in
March 1986 of Waldheim's wartime service.
   Vienna's Socialist mayor, Helmut Zilk, opening an exhibition
looking back at the Nazi era in Austria, sharply criticized the
government for reneging on a promise to help fund the display.
   Zilk charged the coalition government of Socialists and
conservatives had behaved ``like a dog that shakes off fleas'' by
shrugging off the exhibit.
   He speculated aid was withheld because the conservatives
objected to descriptions of the prewar rightist regime called
``Austrofascism'' by liberals and Socialists.
   In his speech, Waldheim left unmentioned his wartime years in
Yugoslavia and Greece and the furor triggered last month by a
historians' report questioning Waldheim's integrity during the war.
   The report did not furnish evidence to clearly back allegations
Waldheim participated in war crimes, but it said he was ``in close
proximity'' to war crimes and did nothing to prevent them.
   Public pressure after the report's release forced Waldheim to
drop plans to speak at a solemn remembrance of the Nazi annexation
on Friday.
   Waldheim recalled the Anschluss, as the Nazi annexation of
Austria is known, as an event that ``triggered an avalanche of
suffering.''
   ``It was an avalanche of suffering that buried those who thought
differently and, in a terrible racial mania, buried our Jewish
fellow citizens,'' Waldheim declared. ``Millions of Jewish people
were annihilated in the concentration camps.
   ``Nothing can explain or excuse those crimes,'' said the
president. ``I bow in deep respect to those victims who must always
serve as a reminder and a duty'' for Austria.
   The controversy over Waldheim has divided Austria and tarnished
the country's image. The U.S. Justice Department last year barred
Waldheim from the country as an undesirable alien.
   Waldheim asked foreign critics ``to see Austria not only in the
light of the horrors of the past but in the light of standing the
test'' of the present.
   Turning to his domestic critics, Waldheim said, ``I ask you to
refrain from blanket charges and from unqualified accusations'' and
instead to see Austria as a country looking into the future ``open
to the world, ready to assist and self-assured.''
   He appealed to Austrians to ``wrestle with the shadows of the
past'' and, repeating earlier statements, called for
``reconciliation.''
   Waldheim also outlined what he called a program of discussion
with politicians of all parties to reform public life and do away
with a wave of corruption and other scandals that have hit
headlines in recent months.
   The moral standards of all who work in public life should
improve, he said.

   The Massachusetts Supreme Court today upheld the
convictions of four men found guilty in the 1983 gang rape of a
woman on a barroom pool table.
   In a pair of unanimous rulings, the state's highest court
rejected defense arguments about the fairness of the lengthy 1984
trial in Bristol Superior Court that attracted national attention.
   The case, which originally involved six young men of Portuguese
descent, drew angry protests by women's groups in support of the
victim and brought agony to the Portuguese-American community in
the fishing city of New Bedford, 60 miles south of Boston.
   In ruling against the defendants, the court upheld the
punishments handed out to Daniel Silvia, who was sentenced to nine
to 12 years in the state prison at Walpole; Joseph Vieira, who drew
six to eight years; and John Cordeiro and Victor Raposo, who were
sentenced to nine to 12 years each. Two other defendants were
acquitted.
   Defense attorneys raised a series of arguments attacking the
handling of the trial by Judge William G. Young, but the high court
rejected each one, saying Young did not abuse his discretion.
   Bristol County District Attorney Ronald Pina said through a
spokeswoman that he was ``very pleased'' with today's rulings.
   ``His faith in the judicial system has been substantiated, in
spite of all the public turmoil in this case. He's pleased that the
community can finally put this issue behind them,'' said
spokeswoman Charlotte Enoksen.
   None of the four defense attorneys involved in the case were in
their offices this morning.
   The justices noted that the jury could have found credible
evidence that on the evening of March 6, 1983, the victim was
attacked at Big Dan's tavern in New Bedford and was forced to have
sex as she was held down on the pool table.
   On appeal, Vieira and Silvia raised several arguments. They
claimed that the prosecutor failed to make a timely disclosure of
certain evidence that might have helped the defense, depriving them
of constitutional rights to due process.
   They also argued that the Bristol County district attorney
suppressed until after trial a witness's recorded account of the
victim's condition and statements shortly after the rape.
   And they argued that Young prejudiced their ability to present a
defense based on the theory that the victim consented to the sexual
encounter. On that claim, Vieira and Silvia complained about the
exclusion of an allegedly false prior complaint of rape by the
woman, and other evidence.
   Each claim was rejected by the unanimous Supreme Court.
   In their separate appeal, Cordeiro and Raposo argued that
Young's order prohibiting coverage of the victim on camera at the
televised trial was an abuse that prejudiced their right to a fair
trial.
   They also claimed that Young erred in refusing to instruct the
jury on the defense of consent to rape. In addition, Raposo raised
claims about Young's decisions on trying the defendants together
and on allowing evidence of a prior conviction.
   Again, the high court dismissed each claim.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most banks said today they didn't
have the cash to open despite a government go-ahead to resume
limited transactions. Roman Catholic bishops urged the military to
bow to civilian rule.
   The National Banking Association, representing 97 of the
approximately 120 banks doing business in Panama, said its members
``are not in condition to renew services'' and will remain ``closed
temporarily.''
   According to the statement, banks reiterated to their depositors
``the security of the funds entrusted to them and their inalterable
decision to find the conditions that might permit the most prompt
return to normality of the banking system.''
   It was the eighth straight day of a nationwide bank closure,
which came a few days after the ouster of President Eric Arturo
Delvalle by supporters of military strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   On Wednesday, the nation's Roman Catholic bishops appealed to
the military to subordinate itself to civilian rule.
   In a statement distributed by Archbishop Marcos McGrath, the
religious leaders also urged fellow Panamanians to put personal and
party interests aside in finding a solution to the crisis.
   It said the bishops believe necessary ``the strict observance of
constitutional standards, the full and effective subordination of
military forces to civilian authority, the search for conditions
and structure that make possible national elections that deserve
the credibility of all the voters, the restoration of the exercise
of all human and civil rights and ... the reopening of the
communications media.''
   Also Wednesday, the nephew of the late Omar Torrijos, Panama's
previous strongman, disclosed that he had broken with the Noriega
government. Santiago Torrijos said he left his post as chief of
Panama's consulate in Los Angeles and was joining forces loyal to
Delvalle.
   Diplomatic sources in Washington, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Torrijos' defection was significant because of the
close identification of his relatives with the Defense Forces.
   The government's National Banking Commission told local and
international financial institutions late Wednesday they could
reopen but only to accept deposits and transfer funds among
themselves and other banks around the world.
   None did.
   The cash shortage was caused by the freezing of millions of
dollars in Panamanian funds in U.S. banks. The United States
continues to recognize Delvalle as the leader of Panama and has
called for the resignation of Noriega, under indictment in Florida
on drug trafficking charges.
   Rufina Escobar, a 55-year-old schoolteacher, said she had enough
food on hand at home to make it through the week. ``But if the
banks don't open next week, I'll have to ask friends for a few
dollars just to eat.''
   Arial Simons, 17, complained that his mother had cut off his
weekly $10 allowance.
   ``I guess I won't be going to the movies or any parties this
weekend,'' he said. ``I don't even have the money to buy a beer.''
   Clerks at Sarah's, one of Panama City's most fashionable
department stores, spent their time dusting shelves, chatting among
themselves and waiting on an occasional customer.
   ``People aren't buying anything unessential,'' said one young
clerk, whose name tag identified him as Esteban. ``They're being
very cautious with their money. Business is way, way down.''
   The young man declined to give his last name ``because I don't
want any trouble.''
   People everywhere were hoarding their cash, which was the only
thing most businesses were accepting because they couldn't process
checks or credit card transactions.
   A lone customer at Sarah's cosmetics department was buying
lipstick, occupying the attention of only one of five bored
saleswomen. The customer explained her purchase almost defensively
as she left the store.
   ``I work in an office and I have to look nice,'' she said. Then
she dug into her purse, pulled out an empty tube of lipstick and
declared: ``Look, this was all I had left. I just had to buy more.
But something like new shoes, that's out.''
   The woman, whose husband admonished her with a wagging finger
not to give her name, said she hadn't bought anything else except
household essentials since the banks closed last week.
   ``I bought large bags of beans and rice, a lot of milk for the
kids and things like that,'' she said. ``But we're being careful,
too, because we don't know how long this thing will last.''

<NOTE>Eds: Updates with new material on vice presidential issue in top

<TEXT>
   Rep. Jack Kemp quit the race for the
Republican presidential nomination today after a string of poor
performances in the early primaries and caucuses, but vowed to
``carry the flag high'' for his conservative causes.
   ``We have not failed because our ideas are winning,'' the New
York congressman said at a Capitol Hill news conference where he
clearly signaled his interest in the 1988 vice presidential
nomination.
   Flanked by members of his family and House members who supported
his White House bid, Kemp said he would not seek re-election to a
10th term in the House from his district in upstate New York, and
had no plans to run for the Senate.
   Asked about the No. 2 spot on this year's ticket, he said,
``Obviously you don't make plans to run for vice president.'' Asked
again, he called the idea ``a very flattering and awesome thought.
... Would I think about it, the answer is yes.''
   Kemp departed the race with a pledge to campaign for the
Republican nominee _ and a blast at the Democrats.
   ``We must never compromise with the liberal Democratic
Congress,'' he said to applause. ``We must replace the liberal
Democratic Congress.''
   Kemp made his exit after failing in his bid to emerge as the
true heir to the Reagan Revolution and the conservative alternative
to GOP front-runner George Bush and Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas.
   His efforts were thrwarted by former television evangelist Pat
Robertson, whose surprise second-place finish in the lead-off Iowa
caucuses was a blow from which the congressman never recovered.
   Even so, he claimed success for his efforts, noting Bush's
statement that he opposes tax increases to cut the deficit and
Dole's support for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels and the Star Wars
initiative pushed by President Reagan.
   Kemp bowed out two days after winning just four delegates from
712 at stake in 17 Super Tuesday contests. His best finish in the
17 GOP contests was a dismal 7 percent showing in the Massachusetts
primary.
   Kemp had 35 committed delegates _ but most of those were handed
to him by Bush in a Michigan compromise designed to prevent
Robertson from claiming a victory.
   Campaign spokesman John Buckley said Kemp spent $15 million on
his effort, and departs with debts of less than $100,000.
   Some aides to Kemp had urged him to get out even before the
Super Tuesday voting across the South and elsewhere, following his
fourth-place finish in South Carolina's primary.
   As recently as Monday Kemp insisted he would press on, but he
acknowledged he had to reassess his candidacy after the Tuesday
voting.
   ``There were rumors we would withdraw after Iowa,'' he said.
``But I'm not a quitter. I'm an ex-quarterback, and I don't enter a
contest lightly.''
   Kemp, a former professional football player, campaigned as a
candidate of ideas and claimed to be heir to President Reagan's
conservative legacy.
   But his emphasis on economic opportunity and talk of returning
to something like a gold standard didn't excite many conservatives
who were concerned about more emotional issues. Despite years of
work for his White House aspirations, Kemp was never able to light
a spark outside his small group of loyalists.
   His problem was summed up last year by Angela Jackson, who tried
to persuade her brother, conservative commentator Patrick J.
Buchanan, to enter the presidential race.
   ``Jack Kemp's been out there for two years,'' she said. ``He's
gone from 7 percent to 7 percent.''
   Kemp, 51, formally entered the GOP race on April 6, 1987.
   He was a strong proponent of deploying the Strategic Defense
Initiative, Reagan's space-based missile defense system, and a
tough opponent of any tax increase.
   He blasted both Bush and Dole in a debate in Dallas in February,
saying they were identical tax raisers whose election would signal
the end of the ``Reagan revolution.'' His rivals countered that in
his zeal, Kemp was ignoring the danger of huge budget deficits.

   Republican presidential hopeful Jack Kemp quit the race today,
saying ``we may have suffered a political defeat but our principles
have not been defeated.'' Democrat Gary Hart was ready to drop out
a second time as the shrinking field converged on Illinois for the
next big campaign test.
   Kemp was crushed in the Super Tuesday landslide of Vice
President George Bush, who rejoined the campaign trail today after
taking a day off to rest and celebrate.
   The New York congressman congratulated Bush and said he would
``be proud to campaign'' for whoever wins the nomination, but he
endorsed none of the three remaining GOP contenders.
   ``I am folding up my tent, but I plan to continue to carry the
flag high,'' said Kemp, the former pro football quarterback who
portrayed himself as the natural conservative heir to President
Reagan, whose economic programs have included many of Kemp's ideas.
   He said both Bush and Sen. Bob Dole have embraced conservative
positions, partly because of his presence in the presidential
campaign.
   Kemp said he would not seek a new term in Congress and was ``not
making any plans'' to run for the Senate or to pursue the vice
presidency. However, he called the idea of the vice presidential
nomination ``a very flattering and awesome thought. ... Would I
think about it, the answer is yes.''
   Dole, who also was all but buried in the Bush victories on
Tuesday, campaigned in Chicago today, trying to sow seeds of doubt
about Bush's chances in November if he should win the GOP
nomination.
   ``I would be a much stronger candidate,'' Dole said.
   Democratic Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee was also in
Chicago, and was making similar comments about his chief rival.
``For those who want another election blowout and see the
Democratic Party losing 49 of 50 states, vote for Mike Dukakis,''
he said.
   On Wednesday, Bush suggested to Dole, his closest competitor,
that the race for the GOP nomination was becoming just a bit beside
the point. It might be time, he said, to turn the attention toward
the general election in November.
   ``I believe it is now time to look ahead to the issues which
distinguish us from the Democrats,'' the vice president told Dole
in a telegram in which he rebuffed the Kansas senator's request for
a series of one-on-one debates.
   ``Good luck,'' Bush added.
   Dole was having none of that, as he searched for a share of
Illinois' 82 GOP delegates at stake in Tuesday's primary.
   ``I've got to win in Illinois,'' he said. Later, he told law
students: ``I feel like I've just taken the finals, and I didn't
flunk but I didn't do too well either.''
   And he taunted Bush for refusing to agree to the no-moderator
debates, saying: ``Here's a chance, George, to finish me off right
here in Illinois.''
   Dole said Wednesday that Kemp telephoned him to tell him he
would drop out on Thursday and to say he would endorse none of his
rivals.
   It looked like the end of the line for Hart as well. The
Colorado senator refused to talk to reporters about the Super
Tuesday results. But he scheduled a Denver news conference Friday
morning, and sources said he was abandoning his bid.
   The Super Tuesday races left Hart disqualified for further
federal matching funds. He technically lost his eligibility last
month, but could have restored it with a 10-percent draw in any of
the day's primaries.
   Hart had already dropped out of the Democratic race once. In
May, he quit amid reports of his relationship with a Miami model,
and he amazed political observers by declaring in December that he
was back.
   ``Let the people decide,'' he said. But the people accorded him
few votes in any of the early contests.
   The rest of the Democrats were gathering for a forum tonight
sponsored by Illinois Democrats.
   Two of the Democrats _ Sen. Paul Simon and Jesse Jackson _ were
campaigning on home turf in Illinois, with its prize of 173
Democratic delegates. Simon, who bypassed Tuesday's contests and
said he must do well in Illinois to continue, wasn't planning to
spend any money on television advertising.
   ``I offer Illinois 30 years of service rather than a 30-second
commercial,'' he said.
   Jackson, for his part, made a triumphant homecoming to Chicago
on Wednesday, still thrilled by his showing the day before. He
placed first in the popular vote, splitting a big delegate haul
with Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis and Gore.
   ``We get stronger every day,'' Jackson told plant workers in
suburban Chicago.
   At a rally later, he promised to eschew attacks on the other
Democrats. ``I'm moving ahead,'' he said. ``I'm going to fight
George Bush. That's my opposition.''
   Gore, however, pronounced himself the Democrat most likely to
succeed in November.
   ``I'm not going to say that any of our candidates are
unelectable,'' he said in an interview on Cable News Network. ``But
I have the best chance.''
   The theme of electability was also sounded by Dukakis. ``I hope
when the people of Illinois cast their votes they'll do so for
someone who can clearly win the presidency,'' he said.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, who carried only his home state of
Missouri in Tuesday's contests, said he was still in the running.
   Pat Robertson, his GOP campaign flagging, said Wednesday he
would take a day off before heading for Illinois. ``It isn't over
yet,'' he said.

   Here is the text of New York Rep. Jack Kemp's
statement Thursday on his withdrawal from the Republican
presidential race:
   Last April, when I was explaining to my family about our race
for the presidency, we had a moment of family time. Jeffrey was
there at the time, as well as Jimmy and Judith and Jennifer, and
Joanne of course. And I quoted the book of Ecclesiastes. I'd like
to share it with you today. It tells us that in everything there is
a season and a time for every purpose under heaven. There's a time
to fight, a time to do battle.
   Well, ladies and gentlemen, we've fought the good fight. We've
fought long and hard and well. I want to thank from the bottom of
my heart my family, my colleagues and comrades-in-arms, the large
family of Kemp supporters across the country. I want to tell each
and every one of you that you can hold your heads high. We've waged
an honorable, spirited, a principled campaign on issues and ideas,
and frankly, in many ways, that's the most important victory of all.
   But then there's a time to refrain, a time to not fight, a time
to accept defeat in one battle, so we can move on to fight again. I
want to salute my fellow candidates: George Bush, Bob Dole, Pat
Robertson, and Pete du Pont and Alexander Haig as well. And Joanne
and I particularly want to congratulate today George and Barbara
Bush for their great victory across the South on Super Tuesday.
Today, I'm withdrawing from the race for president. I'm folding up
my tent, but I want you to know I'm going to continue to carry the
flag high now and in the future.
   Far more important than personal success in an election is the
cause in which we believe. I ran for the presidency to ensure that
the torch that we lit in 1980 in Detroit, Michigan, when we
nominated Ronald Reagan and revolutionized the Republican Party,
would burn even brighter and help light the way into the 1990s.
   We may have suffered a political defeat, but our principles have
not been defeated. We have not failed because our ideas are
winning. We know our ideas are winning when George Bush says we
must not reduce the deficit by raising taxes, that we need to cut
the capital gains tax, that we need to enact free enterprise zones
to unleash the talent of the inner city and to create more jobs,
and when he says that we need to strengthen free and open trade
throughout the world.
   We know our ideas are winning when Bob Dole pledges to support
the freedom fighters and deploy the Strategic Defense Initiative.
We know our ideas are winning when every single Republican
candidate says that he supports the inalienable right to life for
the born and the unborn, and pledges to fight for a pro-family, and
a drug-free future for America. I want you to know, I'll be proud
to campaign for any Republican nominee who carries that banner, and
I will fight at his side as long and as far as he carries that
banner on the field of friendly strife.
   To my fellow Republicans, I would say that in politics as in the
marketplace, winning means staying ahead of your competitors. It
means not only having better ideas, but carrying them through to
completion. Our party must never drift back to mindless austerity.
We must never close our eyes to economic and moral challege. We
must never break faith with the family or with senior citizens, or
ignore the threat from a dangerous enemy that remains at war with
freedom and democracy throughout the world.
   Let the liberal Democrats try to raise the burden of taxes on
the workers and the families of America. Let liberal Democrats turn
their backs on the freedom fighters around the globe. Let liberal
Democrats raise tariffs on our allies and friends while they shirk
the responsibility to preserve peace through strength. The American
people will reject such a party, just as roundly and overwhelmingly
in 1988 as they did in 1980 and 1984.
   Ladies and gentlemen, we must not compromise with the liberal
Democratic Congress. We must replace the liberal Democratic
Congress with a free-enterprise Congress. Ours is a greater cause.
Our ideas can move America and the whole world forward, but like
the Good Shepherd, we can't leave anyone behind.
   We can't rest until our economy is so strong that there's a job
for every man and woman in America who wants to work, until our
dollar once again is as good as gold and the budget is in balance.
We can't rest until we've helped freedom fighters to victory and
until we've researched, tested, developed, deployed, and built a
strategic defense for the United States of America and our allies
in Europe and Israel. We can't rest until all of us, black and
white, Christian and Jew, rich or poor, are living in an America
that is more prosperous but more tolerant, more decent and more
generous, an America bound together as the founder of our party,
Abraham Lincoln, envisioned the Republican Party _ as a people
party, as a freedom party, as an emancipation party, to help make
America one nation under God with liberty and justice and equality
of opportunity for all.
   I want to close, if I can, my remarks by pulling from my pocket
something I've carried around with me since Super Tuesday. Joanne
and I went to bed Tuesday night and found a little note on our
pillow from one of our children. It was from our daughter Jennifer,
and she told us that she loved us and that she was proud of us. And
then, as a typical Kemp child, she ended by quoting Winston
Churchill. And it wasn't because they all went to Winston Churchill
High School; it's because all the Kemps love Churchill, as
freedom-loving men and women do throughout the world.
   Jennifer ended her little letter by saying, ``Finally, Dad, as
Winston Churchill said, `Success is never final, failure is never
fatal, it's courage that counts.' And you're the most courageous
people I know.'' Well, I want you all to know that no father, no
candidate, no human being could ask for more than to have a
courageous family, courageous comrades-in-arms, and courageous men
and women around this country who believe in the ideas upon which
America was built in the past, and upon which, alone, we can build
a great victory for America and the world in the future.
   Thank you, Jennifer. Thank you to my family. Thank you to each
and every one of you. And may God continue to bless America. Thank
you very, very, very much.

   Thousands of police patrolled the Tibetan
capital of Lhasa on foot and in trucks today on the anniversary of
a bloody uprising. Foreigners in Lhasa said hundreds of people were
arrested in the past six days.
   The anniversary of the outbreak of the 1959 Tibetan uprising
against Chinese rule passed without major incident, said foreigners
in Lhasa contacted by telephone from the southwest China city of
Chengdu.
   But more than 100 trucks carrying armed police drove through the
main streets of the city of 150,000 in a show of force and several
dozen police with machine guns stood in front of the city's holiest
Buddhist temple, the Jokhang, said Benjamin Watson of New York
City, a tourist.
   Watson, who speaks Tibetan, said Tibetans estimated at least 300
people had been arrested since a clash Saturday between police and
Tibetans demanding independence. Up to eight people were reported
killed in the clashes.
   The official news agency Xinhua also said the situation in Lhasa
today was normal. It said 100 top Tibetans gathered in Lhasa to
denounce the riots and ``those who conduct evil doings under the
guise of lama (monks).''
   Another foreign traveler in Lhasa, who said she spoke some
Tibetan, said Tibetans had told her of a police sweep today on the
Jokhang Temple in which monks were arrested. She spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   She said armed police were stationed at every corner of the
Barkhor market square around the Jokhang, and there was no
recurrence of Saturday's daylong battle between police and monk-led
Tibetans.
   March 10 is the 29th anniversary of a Tibetan revolt against
Chinese rule that resulted in the flight of the Dalai Lama,
spiritual leader of the Tibetans, and 100,000 followers, and a
bloody crackdown by the Chinese army.
   A Nepalese-Tibetan interviewed today in the southwestern China
city of Chengdu, air gateway to Lhasa, said he had seen signs in
Lhasa written in Tibetan and posted before Saturday's disturbance
calling for people to rise up on March 10.
   On that day in 1959, thousands of Tibetans surrounded the
Norbulinka, the Dalai Lama's summer palace in Lhasa, after hearing
rumors that their god-king would be kidnapped by the Chinese army.
   On March 17 the Dalai Lama fled from the palace and led his
followers to exile in India. On March 20 the army attacked the
palace, and quashed the rebellion after three days of bloody
fighting.
   In New Delhi today, about 200 Tibetan refugees clashed with
police during a rally marking the anniversary of the abortive
uprising. Seven Tibetans and nine policemen were injured.
   In a statement issued from his home in exile in Dharamsala,
northern India, the Dalai Lama called on Tibetans to ``honor the
courage of our brethren in Tibet who have taken to the streets to
draw attention to their suffering under Chinese colonial rule.''
   China, which took control of Tibet in 1950, claims the mountain
region has been part of Chinese territory for seven centuries. Many
Tibetans disagree, and hold deep antagonisms toward the Chinese
because of the Communist government's past suppression of Tibetan
language, customs and religion.
   Tibetans, led by monks from Lhasa's main monasteries, staged
three pro-independence demonstrations last September and October,
including a violent clash on Oct. 1 in which at least 14 died.
   After those disturbances, Chinese authorities closed off some
monasteries and subjected monks to re-education campaigns.
   There were no other major shows of resistance and authorities
decided to go ahead with the annual 10-day ``moinlam qenmo'' prayer
festival, one of Tibetan Buddhism's most important events.
   The disturbances Saturday began on the final day of the
festival, when monks stood up at the Jokhang Temple, began shouting
pro-independence and pro-Dalai Lama slogans and throwing rocks at
police.
   Except for sporadic rock-throwing incidents on Sunday, Lhasa has
reportedly been calm since Saturday.

<HEAD>Texas Files Suit Against USDA over Florida Citrus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas fired a new salvo in its war
against Florida citrus by suing U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
E. Lyng.
   The suit, filed Wednesday in federal court in Brownsville,
accuses Lyng of violating federal law when the U.S. Department of
Agriculture ended a 3{-year quarantine on shipments of fresh
Florida citrus to Texas and other citrus-producing areas.
   Texas wants to keep the Florida fruit out because of a fear of
bacterial citrus canker, officials said. Canker prompted the ban on
Florida citrus after an outbreak of the disease in some areas there
in August 1984.
   U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela denied Texas' request for an
emergency stay of a USDA rule that on Feb. 11 ended the Florida
citrus ban.
   Vela scheduled a hearing for Monday morning when federal
attorneys will have an opportunity to comment on the action brought
Wednesday by officials of the Texas attorney general's office and
state agriculture department.
   USDA officials in Washington declined comment on the lawsuit
this morning, said department spokeswoman Tammy Bragg.
   The suit accuses Lyng of violating the federal Administrative
Procedure Act by lifting the quarantine without publishing notice
and providing a chance for a public hearing.
   The bacterial canker disease can cause defoliation of citrus
trees, lesions that render the fruit unmarketable, and premature
dropping of the fruit from the tree. The disease exists in several
forms, with some considered less dangerous than others.
   A Gulf Coast area of Florida where the aggressive Asiatic strain
of canker was discovered remains under quarantine.
   Last September, the USDA published a proposal to lift the
quarantine against Florida fruit, but on Jan. 5 withdrew the
proposal after new canker outbreaks were discovered in Florida.
   On Feb. 15, four days after Lyng lifted the ban, Texas imposed
an emergency 30-day quarantine on fresh Florida citrus.
   Florida producers maintain that canker presents a minimal threat
to the Texas citrus industry, and some Florida growers filed suit
last month to stop the Texas quarantine. The quarantine would have
expired next Saturday.
   A federal court in Austin on March 1 overturned the Texas
quarantine, and ruled that the federal rule took precedence over
the state's action.
   The suit filed on Wednesday accuses Lyng of violating federal
law by not giving the public or the state opportunity to comment.
   The Texas suit seeks reinstatement of the quarantine and a
formal hearing process if USDA makes a new proposal to end the
quarantine on Florida citrus.
   The lawsuit says Texas at least would like to keep Florida fruit
out of the lower Rio Grande Valley, where the state's $65 million
citrus industry is concentrated on about 30,000 acres in Hidalgo,
Cameron and Willacy counties.

   The Soviet Union said today that an agreement on
the withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan is not a commitment
to end military aid to the Kabul government.
   Soviet ambassador Nikolay Kozyrev said the question of a halt to
Soviet assistance has ``not arisen'' in the almost 6-year-old
U.N.-sponsored Afghanistan peace talks.
   He said the draft agreement would not bar any kind of Soviet
aid, except the sending of new troops into Afghanistan, where the
Soviets intervened in 1979. An estimated 115,000 Soviet troops are
helping the Marxist government fight U.S.-backed Moslem insurgents.
   Kozyrev rejected the U.S. demand for a ``symmetrical cessation''
of military aid to both sides in the war. Kozyrev said it was an
attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of Afghanistan and in
the bilateral relationship between Kabul and Moscow.
   He said the demand would be tantamount to Moscow calling for an
end to U.S. military aid for Pakistan.
   Kozyrev also warned that if a Geneva settlement were not signed,
a ``new flare-up of bloodshed and fratricidal war cannot be
excluded.''
   Kozyrev, a specialist on Asian affairs, came to Geneva as head
of a Soviet team of experts to follow the peace talks. His remarks
followed a statement by Afghan foreign minister Abdul Wakil, who
said Wednesday that Moscow had helped Afghanistan for years and
would continue to do so after the troop withdrawal.
   Wakil has said earlier that the draft agreements provided only
for a halt to arms shipments to the guerrillas fighting the Kabul
government. The United States is considered the insurgents' main
supplier, with deliveries totaling a reported $700 million last
year.
   Kozyrev said the peace talks have ``bogged down'' because of
Pakistan's insistence on having a settlement linked to the
formation of a transitional government in Kabul to oversee the
withdrawal of the Red Army troops.
   Pakistan, which represents Afghan rebels in the peace talks,
says that a government to replace the present Soviet-backed one
would ensure stability and the safe return of more than 5 million
Afghan refugees.
   Kozyrev sidestepped a question on whether negotiations could
continue after next Tuesday, a target date set by Moscow. Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev said last month that the troops would
leave Afghanistan starting May 15 if an agreement were reached
March 15.
   ``I can only hope that the other side (Pakistan) will show
enough common sense and responsibility,'' he said, adding later,
``It is too early to say what will happen after that date.''
   Wakil and the Pakistani delegations have both made plain that
they do not consider March 15 a deadline and that a settlement at a
later date would just put off the start of the withdrawal.

   Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole sought
today to sow doubts about the party's front-runner, saying Vice
President George Bush will face a ``tough, tough race'' in November
if he is the GOP nominee.
   ``I would be a much stronger candidate,'' Dole said as he
campaigned in the Chicago area. ``That's the message we're going to
try to make in the next couple of days.''
   Dole planned to concentrate today on suburban Chicago before
heading downstate for a swing Friday through farm country where the
Kansas senator considers his support the strongest.
   He started the day with a tour of the Rehabilitation Hospital of
Chicago, which is near another hospital where Dole underwent
surgery 40 years ago for injuries he received in World War II.
   ``This is going to be the political recovery state just as it
was the personal recovery state 40 years ago,'' Dole said on
Wednesday. ``That may be more symbolism than anything, but to me it
is an indication that it can be done.''
   On Wednesday, one day after Dole's Super Tuesday drubbing, a
senior campaign adviser was quizzed whether the results had
triggered a ``meltdown'' in the Kansas Republican's presidential
candidacy.
   ``Well, we might have started evacuating around the reactor,''
quipped the aide, Thomas Rath.
   His reply reflected the perilous situation as Dole's campaign
works toward the March 15 Illinois primary, which even the
candidate openly acknowledges is a do-or-die contest if he is to
have any chance of beating Vice President George Bush for the GOP
presidential nomination.
   Dole, campaigning in the Chicago area on Wednesday, said he must
win at least 65 percent of all remaining delegates nationwide as
well as those who are uncommitted if he is to emerge victorious.
His first objective is Illinois, a state where Bush has the backing
of Gov. James Thompson and 93 of the state's 102 GOP county
chairmen.
   ``I've got to win Illinois,'' Dole said bluntly at one campaign
stop. Later, speaking to Northwestern University law school
students, Dole made it even more clear that his political survival
was at stake. He renewed a challenge to Bush to participate in a
series of freewheeling one-one-one debates.
   ``I just appeal to George Bush. Here's a chance, George, to
finish me off right here in Illinois,'' Dole said. The debate
challenge is mentioned at every campaign stop and is a key part of
Dole's strategy to try to draw Bush into a discussion of issues and
break his link to President Reagan. Dole attributes Bush's sweep of
the 17 Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses to Reagan's popularity.
   ``George Bush is running like Ronald Reagan,'' said Dole. ``It's
tough to beat Ronald Reagan. I can't beat him. I can beat Bush, but
beating Ronald Reagan is impossible. Bush has wrapped himself
around Reagan and it's been very effective.''
   Dole never misses an opportunity to chip away at Bush's record
and to raise questions about the vice president's ability to defeat
a Democrat in the November general election.
   ``I don't have any real quarrel with George Bush except I think
I'm a stronger person. I think I know more about the issues. I
think I'm a better leader,'' Bush told a group of lawyers at a
downtown Chicago reception.
   Already, the Dole campaign is airing television advertising in
Illinois that touts Dole's leadership in the Senate and focuses on
what the Kansan says are nine different answers by Bush to his role
in the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages affair. Similar ads were used
to no avail against Bush in the South.
   But increasingly, Dole is highlighting the ``electability''
question in his attempts to revive his campaign _ even though he
concedes ``it's hard to make that an issue.''
   ``I think there is one person between me and the White House and
that is George Bush,'' Dole quipped at the lawyers' reception. ``I
think there are a couple of people between him and the White
House.''
   Dole told supporters ``if I can turn it around in Illinois ...
then the momentum changes.''
   ``The Republicans, I think, will take a deep breath and
reconsider the choice before them,'' he said. ``And that's why I
take heart that I'm sort of back in the heartland.''

<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts of a televised speech
Thursday by President Kurt Waldheim as Austria remembers the Nazi
annexation of March 1938. The text was translated from German by
The Associated Press.
   
   In these days, we are remembering the events which 50 years ago
led us into the darkest epoch of our recent history.
   ... There were also hundreds of thousands of Austrians, who
welcomed the Anschluss, who feted Hitler and the invasion and
pinned many false hopes on it.
   It was a mass psychosis of a kind that only totalitarian regimes
can create. Today we know that one should resist the very
beginnings of intolerance and instigation. Today we know where the
fanning of fanaticism, hate and violence lead.
   Today we know that, with March 11, 1938, an avalanche of
suffering was triggered.
   It was an avalanche of suffering that buried those who thought
differently and, in a terrible racial mania, buried our Jewish
fellow citizens. The Holocaust is one of the greatest tragedies of
world history. Millions of Jewish people were annihilated in the
concentration camps. Nothing can explain or excuse those crimes. I
bow in deep respect before these victims, who must always be a
reminder and a duty for us.
   The avalanche of suffering also caught up countless men and
women of the resistance, who had to give their life for the freedom
of Austria.
   We must not forget that many of the worst Nazi hangmen were
Austrians. There were Austrians who were victims and others who
were perpetrators. Let us not give rise to the impression that we
had nothing to do with this. Obviously there is no collective
guilt. Nevertheless, as head of state of the Republic of Austria, I
wish to apologize for Nazi crimes committed by Austrians.
   But as a state, Austria was Hitler's first victim. That is
indisputable. Though it resisted Hitler's political and economic
pressure for years, it went under. The international community of
states gave us no help against the aggression.
   Our country is open to criticism. As the head of state of our
republic, however, I would ask the critics to be fair and
objective. I would ask them not only to see Austria in the light of
the horrors of the past, but in the light of how it has stood the
test in the present.
   I ask you to refrain from blanket charges and from unqualified
accusations and to look at Austria as it stands in the late 1980s:
secure and open to dialogue, open to the world, ready to assist,
self-assured and pointed toward the future.
   But as your elected president, I also appeal to you, my dear
countrywomen and countrymen, to wrestle with the shadows of the
past. The meaning of these days lies in reflection, not in dispute.
... The meaning of these days can be only one thing: reconciliation.
   The ugly storm of scandals which has confronted us in the last
years underlies the necessity of a basic reform of public life ...
of an improvement of moral standards for all who have to act and
work in the public interest. In the coming months, I will use the
authority of this office to discuss the perspectives and contours
of such a reform with representatives of all political institutions
in Austria.
   The moral renewal of our republic is an undertaking which can
only have the desired success if it is supported and carried by all
those responsible.
   Let us assume resonsibility for our mistakes in a way that would
encourage avoiding mistakes in the future. Let us love our country
without false shame and arrogant pride so that Austria also finds a
place in the hearts of youth:
   _ as a country that has come to terms with itself,
   _ as a country which has learned from history,
   _ as a country that despite some mistakes deserves affection,
   _ as our common ``much tested, much loved'' Austria.

<HEAD>Non-Cancerous Patch Of Skin Removed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dermatologist removed a small patch of skin
from Nancy Reagan's upper lip and tests show it to be
non-cancerous, her spokeswoman said Thursday.
   ``It was from too much sun,'' Mrs. Reagan's press secretary,
Elaine Crispen, said.
   The first lady ``had a little scraping'' done to remove the skin
patch and no stiches were required, Mrs. Crispen said. She was
informed of the results of the tests on Monday, the spokeswoman
added.
   The procedure was performed at the White House over the weekend
by Adm. William Narva, a U.S. Naval dermatologist who is the
attending physician to Congress, the spokeswoman said.
   The first lady wore a small adhesive bandage for two days but is
no longer wearing one, Mrs. Crispen said.
   The procedure marked the second time the first lady has had a
growth removed from the area. In 1982, a growth was removed that
was diagnosed as a basal cell carcinoma.
   Last August, President Reagan had a skin cancer identified as a
basal cell epithelioma removed from the tip of his nose. It was his
third procedure in three years dealing with skin cancer.
   In their younger days and as residents of California, Reagan and

<HEAD>Not All is Merry in Nottingham as City Debunks Robin Hood</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Fans of Robin Hood are up in arms and the city of
Nottingham has been accused of shooting itself in the wallet by
putting out a tourism brochure debunking the legend of the medieval
outlaw.
   The glossy color brochure takes a skeptical academic line on
Robin Hood, his love affair with Maid Marian, the existence of his
faithful lieutenant Friar Tuck and that he robbed the rich to give
to the poor.
   ``We are not debunking anything. We are putting Robin Hood in
historical context,'' insisted City Council spokesman Tim Jones.
   ``The city fathers have done a disservice to their own city,''
countered Malcolm Barker of the Robin Hood Society, who took up the
cudgels on the outlaw's behalf.
   Barker doesn't claim that the story, as handed down by
Hollywood, is true. He simply objects to tinkering with a beautiful
legend that also is a major tourist attraction.
   ``If Mickey Mouse can bring a fortune into Florida, why
shouldn't Robin Hood bring a fortune in to the people of
Nottingham?'' he said in a British radio interview.
   The affair came to light Thursday in London's Daily Telegraph in
a report headlined ``Robin Hood is robbed of myth and romance.''
   The brochure undermines many of the popular notions about Robin
Hood and his band of merry men, not to mention his favorite woman.
   Maid Marian, it says, comes from a 13th century French poem,
while chubby Friar Tuck is probably an amalgam of two characters
from different parts of England.
   As for Robin himself, the brochure notes that in the earliest
tales, he was a highwayman who robbed travelers in neighboring
Yorkshire and was in business strictly for himself.
   Graham Black, curator of Nottingham Castle Museum and a
historian whose work contributed to the brochure, was quoted by the
Telegraph as saying: ``One of the problems about Robin Hood is that
the legend is 700 years old, a story handed on by word of mouth,
and it was 200 years before people became literate.''
   His philanthropy was ``the fashionable academic interpretation
of the 1950s,'' Black said. ``But there is no evidence for this.''
   Jones said in an interview that the legend took its present form
under the 19th century Victorians.
   It remains a potent one. When Raisa Gorbachev, wife of the
Soviet leader, visited Nottingham in 1984, city officials said she
asked about Robin Hood, apparently regarding him as a socialist who
believed in the redistribution of wealth.
   Barker, the outlaw's defender, said: ``Does it really matter?
... It's an adman's dream. We've got something here that is
wonderful. Visitors come from all over the world that know about
Robin Hood and Maid Marian, and I think that the city fathers have
done a disservice to their own city.''
   Nottingham, a city of 290,000 people in central England, can
hardly be accused of neglecting the legend. Its main beltway is
called Maid Marian Way, and two rival consortiums are planning
Robin Hood exhibition centers for the city.
   Hordes of tourists visit the Sherwood Forest Center where they
can see displays of medieval lifestyles and gaze at the oak tree
where the merry men may or may not have relaxed after a hard day's
archery.
   Brian Marshal, chairman of the city tourism council that
produced the brochure, says the debate about Maid Marian is largely
irrelevant. People are more interested in Robin Hood versus the
Sheriff of Nottingham, he said, ``because it's always the good guy
against the bad guy, isn't it.''
   ``I think people will feel what they feel. If they want to
believe in Maid Marian then they'll do that,'' he said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Can't Assess Damage From Toshiba Submarine Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon doesn't know whether the sale of
Japanese machine milling equipment helped the Soviet Union build
quieter submarines, according to a top Defense Department official.
   The Soviet Union was building quiet propellers for its subs
three years before the Toshiba equipment was exported between 1983
and 1985, said Richard Armitage, assistant secretary of defense for
international security affairs.
   Armitage's assessment was contained in a letter outlining the
Pentagon's opposition to congressional proposals which would limit
or ban the sale of Toshiba products in the United States.
   Toshiba officials admitted last year that a subsidiary company
had sold the Soviet Union machine tools for making quiet submarine
propellers.
   Navy officials have said in the past that Soviet subs were
noisier than their American counterparts, making it easier for the
United States to keep track of the Soviet subs. Both sides are
continually seeking to develop quieter submarines.
   Armitage's views were outlined in a letter to Rep. Les Aspin,
D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. The letter
was released Thursday.
   ``The indignation felt in the United States is understandable,''
Armitage said. He added that ``Perhaps some Americans don't fully
realize that many Japanese feel a similar indignation complemented
by acute embarrassment.''
   ``The actual damage done from the Toshiba Machinery diversions
is difficult to assess,'' Armitage said.
   ``Despite allegations of tens of even $100 billion in damages,
our Navy cannot determine the direct costs of this diversion to
U.S. national security because the Soviets had quiet propellers
three years before the first diversion and we had already planned
programs to deal with this development,'' he said.
   A conference committee of 20 House members and seven senators is
trying to work out House-Senate differences on an omnibus trade
bill, and one of the unresolved issues involves Toshiba.
   The House bill contains no sanctions against the company, while
the Senate version would ban the sale of any Toshiba products in
the United States for two years to five years. Toshiba has annual
U.S. sales of $3 billion to $4 billion.
   ``Actions by the U.S. government against Toshiba would be
interpreted in Japan as motivated by trade imbalances, rather than
by national security concerns,'' Armitage said.
   He predicted that Japanese efforts to protect sensitive
technology ``will greatly improve as a result of what has happened,
but only if we don't undercut the post-Toshiba actions'' by the
Japanese government, which he described as ``unprecedented.''
   The Pentagon is considering whether to sell the Japanese navy
four Aegis ship defense systems, costing $1 billion each. The
system contains the Navy's most sophisticated anti-aircraft
electronic gear, and some critics in Congress have questioned
whether the Aegis sale is a good idea in the wake of the Toshiba
case.

   The House today overwhelmingly demanded the
ouster of Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega and urged
President Reagan to impose strong sanctions to encourage
restoration of civilian rule in Panama.
   Before the 367-2 roll call vote on an anti-Noriega resolution,
the Panamanian military ruler was denounced during floor debate as
``a gunrunning thug'' and ``one of the most ruthless tyrants of our
time.''
   Voting against the resolution were representatives George W.
Crockett Jr., D-Mich., and Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas.
   ``Now is the time for Gen. Noriega to step down and open the
door for true democracy in Panama,'' said Rep. Benjamin Gilman,
R-N.Y.
   Said Rep. Dan Mica, D-Fla.: ``Noriega must leave, and he must
leave quickly.''
   The resolution, sponsored chiefly by Mica, said the House ``is
deeply concerned about the deterioration of United
States-Panamanian relations'' and calls on Noriega to comply with
President Eric Arturo Delvalle's order dismissing him as commander
of the Panamanian defense forces.
   The resolution also ``calls on the president to consider
seriously the range of additional economic and political sanctions
available to the United States that could be used to encourage the
re-establishment of civilian authority in Panama.'''
   The House action came as the Reagan administration studied tough
new sanctions against Panama, and two prominent Panamanian
diplomats deserted the Noriega government.
   Santiago Torrijos, nephew of former Panamanian leader Omar
Torrijos, abandoned his post as consul general in Los Angeles and
flew to Washington to join forces with allies of the ousted
Delvalle.
   Torrijos' late uncle was widely esteemed in Panama for
negotiating with President Carter for the treaty under which the
Panama Canal will revert to Panama by the year 2000. The former
consul general accused the Noriega regime of plunging Panama into a
political crisis.
   Panamanian Ambassador Juan B. Sosa, who supports Delvalle, said
Wednesday that Santiago Torrijos' decision to break with Noriega
will have a major impact on Panama because of the close
identification of the Torrijos family with Panama's Defense Forces.
Torrijos is believed to be the first member of the Torrijos family
to break ranks with Noriega.
   Omar Torrijos dominated Panama's political life from 1968 until
his death in a plane crash in 1981. In a typewritten statement made
public Wednesday night, his nephew said a ``political, financial,
moral and social crisis'' exists in Panama and must be resolved.
   He said that a ``small political-military circle'' has betrayed
the pledge of Omar Torrijos to return Panama to constitutional rule.
   Meanwhile, the Panamanian Embassy made public a copy of a letter
by Panama's Ambassador to Mexico, Emilia Arosemena Vallarino, in
which she announced her resignation because she was ``in
disagreement with political events'' in her country. She had served
in Mexico for 18 years and was dean of the diplomatic corps there.
   At issue are the circumstances under which Panama's new
government took power two weeks ago. Delvalle attempted to fire
Noriega but was fired himself hours later.
   The Reagan administration, along with a number of Panamanian
diplomats and consular officers, have refused to recognize the
successor government, regarding Delvalle as the constitutional
authority. He has remained in hiding for almost two weeks.
   Today, high-level meetings were scheduled at which
administration officials were considering a series of economic
sanctions against Panama.
   U.S. officials, who asked not to be identified, said that it is
almost certain that the United States will withhold a $6.5 million
payment due to Panama on March 15 for canal-related operations.
   Also being considered are measures that would have the effect of
making some Panamanian products less competitive in U.S. markets.
State Department figures show that Panama's U.S. exports totaled
$342 million last year, but Commerce Department statistics list
that category at $388 million.
   The officials said Panama may lose its right to participate in
the Caribbean Basin Initiative, under which some products are
allowed duty-free access to the United States.
   To be eligible to take part, nations of Central America and the
Caribbean must cooperate in combatting drug smuggling to the United
States.
   The Reagan administration has concluded that Panama has not been
cooperating, and two federal grand juries have handed down
indictments accusing Noriega of being a key figure in an
international drug trafficking operation.
   But White House chief of staff Howard Baker denied Wednesday
that the United States is planning an invasion of Panama, saying
American troops there are merely holding regularly scheduled
training exercises.
   Jorge Abadia, Panama's foreign minister, this week accused the
United States of conducting ``the prelude of an armed invasion'' by
staging military exercises along the Panama Canal.

   Gov. Evan Mecham's former chief of staff
testified today at the governor's impeachment trial that he would
not have directed the state's public safety director to stonewall
an investigation, as the governor is accused of doing.
   Mecham, who faces removal from office by the state Senate, is
accused of trying to thwart an investigation into an alleged death
threat by then-state prison construction chief Lee Watkins against
a former Mecham aide, Donna Carlson. The threat allegedly was made
as Ms. Carlson was about to appear before a grand jury
investigating Mecham's campaign finances. Watkins has denied
threatening Ms. Carlson.
   Mecham also is accused of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan
and misusing $80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by loaning
it to his auto dealership.
   Richard Burke, the governor's first defense witness, was
cross-examined by prosecutor William French in his second day on
the stand.
   He acknowledged that he would not have made the statements that
Mecham is accused of making Nov. 15 to Department of Public Safety
Director Ralph Milstead.
   French quoted from statements Milstead has testified Mecham made
regarding plans for Officer Frank Martinez and Lt. Beau Johnson to
give statements to the attorney general's office about the alleged
threat.
   ``Would you under any circumstances, Mr. Burke, tell Mr.
Milstead `I don't want Frank or Beau giving any statements to the
attorney general.' Would you say that?'' French asked.
   ``No,'' Burke replied.
   ``Would you say this: `Don't tell the attorney general
anything,''' French said.
   ``No,'' Burke answered.
   Burke, a former law school dean and federal prosecutor who came
out of retirement last November to serve as Mecham's chief of
staff, said he believed Mecham understood that a serious threat may
have been made against Carlson, although Burke was not certain
whether it was specified that it was an alleged death threat.
   ``I think all of us assumed that it was a crime, or a potential
crime, or it wouldn't have been reported to us,'' Burke said.
   French asked whether it was Milstead's job to report the alleged
crime ``and the governor would not have the authority to stop it.''
   ``My impression of law enforcement, certainly that would be
true,'' Burke said.
   Burke said, however, that he agreed with Mecham's contention in
a television interview several days after he was told about the
alleged threat that he knew little about it.
   During House impeachment hearings in January, Mecham insisted
that the report to the Department of Public Safety violated an
unwritten rule against disclosing things that happen in the
governor's office.
   The prosecution rested its case Wednesday on the death threat
allegation, the first of the three major charges against Mecham.
   ``No man is above the law,'' prosecutor Paul Eckstein said in
his closing argument. ``The evidence that has been put before you
cries out ... for a conviction.''
   Defense lawyer Fred Craft argued that prosecutors had not proven
Mecham tried to obstruct an investigation because ``nobody told the
governor that there was indeed an attorney general's investigation
that he could possibly obstruct.''
   Mecham, 63, who ran an auto dealership before he was elected
governor in a three-way race, has contended he handled the matter
properly by having Watkins' boss, then-Department of Administration
Director Max Hawkins, investigate.
   A two-thirds vote of the 30-member Senate is required to convict
Mecham and remove the first-term Republican from office.
   The governor also faces an April 21 criminal trial on charges of
hiding the $350,000 loan, and a May 17 recall election.
   Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Michael Ryan said Wednesday
he was ``reluctantly'' granting a prosecution motion to delay the
criminal trial, which had been scheduled to start March 22. The
judge said more time was needed to decide pretrial motions and
gather a large pool of potential jurors.
   Mecham, the first U.S. governor to be impeached in six decades,
has not attended the impeachment trial, but senators Wednesday were
shown a Nov. 16 TV interview in which he denied knowledge of the
alleged death threat.

   The probe of the collision of two Army
Blackhawk helicopters that killed 17 soldiers has found no link to
mechanical problems that have grounded the military's UH-60s in
recent years, an investigator says.
   ``I would say now there is no indication of any mechanical
factor'' in Tuesday night's crash, said Chief Warrant Officer Joe
S. Adams, one of three investigators from the Army Safety Center at
Fort Rucker, Ala.
   ``We are looking at human and environmental factors. The human
factors might include some restriction of vision,'' he said
Wednesday.
   Both pilots were using night-vision goggles, which amplify light
from the stars and the moon, allowing pilots to fly undetected at
night. Officials said they were trying to determine whether the
choppers were flying without lights.
   The crash was the worst Army aviation disaster since 248
soldiers, also based at Fort Campbell, died in a chartered plane
crash in Canada while returning from a Mideast peacekeeping mission
in December 1985.
   The 17 died instantly in the collision, the worst ever at the
fort in southwestern Kentucky, but eight bodies remained buried
under the wreckage for hours, spokesmen said.
   The Army's fleet of 820 UH-60s was grounded twice last May, once
for inspection and once because of a design flaw. The fleet also
was grounded in April 1985 and March 1986 after fatal crashes. In
1985, the Army identified a defect in the main rotor assembly and
ordered it corrected.
   Last summer, officials said about 40 people had been killed in
crashes of the helicopter since 1978.
   The collision occurred when a copter on a night training mission
struck a formation of three other Blackhawks on a separate mission,
Adams said.
   The formation was flying east at about 250 feet above the ground
when the lead Blackhawk was hit broadside by the lone aircraft,
which was traveling north, Army spokesmen said.
   A flight data recorder, installed in 100 of the Army's
helicopters, was recovered from the northbound craft and will be
checked for signs of mechanical failure in the copter, Adams said.
The other craft had no recorder.
   The manufacturer, Sikorsky Aircraft of Stratford, Conn., sent a
safety expert to assist investigators. Adams said a report was
expected in two to three months.
   Investigators hoped that air traffic control tapes would reveal
whether the pilots knew their copters were converging.
   The helicopters are not equipped with radar and the pilots,
wearing the night vision goggles, were operating under visual
flight rules, with visibility of at least one mile and a ceiling of
500 feet, Adams said.
   The accident occurred on the Kentucky-Tennessee state line 6
miles from the copters' airstrip, about 60 miles north of Nashville.
   The Army identified the dead as: Staff Sgt. Charles L. Shirley,
32, of Madison, Ill.; Billie D. Bolin, 29, of Greensburg, Ky.;
James M. Guill, 33, of Georgetown, Ky.; Richard L. Alter, 29, of
Williamsport, Pa. and Clifford W. Bath III, 19, of Charleston, S.C.
   Also, Michael A. Jankowski, 19, of Sussex, Wis.; James Draper,
Jr., 20, of Fruitland, N.M.; Jeffrey L. Rivas, 26, of Santa
Barbara, Calif.; Andrew J. Franklin III, 20, of Advance, Ind. and
Michael Daniel, 32, of Delaware, Ohio.
   Also, Brian J. LeBlanc, 21, of Cold Springs, Minn.; Sgt. Dennis
C. Sabot, 30, of Bismark, N.D.; Gregory T. Dean, 24, of Liberty,
Ky.; Spec. 4 Samuel A. Hintz, 24, of Sherrodsville, Ohio and
Timothy S. Sayer, 20, of Worthington, Ohio.
   Shirley, Sabot and Hintz were from the 2nd Battalion, 502nd
Infantry. Identifications of the other two victims were withheld
pending notification of relatives.
   ``He believed he was doing what was right, doing it for his
country,'' Jerry Shirley of Clarksville, Tenn., said of his
brother, an 11-year Army man. ``It's something he wanted to do. He
was a career man. He started when he was 17 and had a break and
went back in. We accepted the risk.''
   Lt. Col. Charles Adams, the post chaplain, said 35 chaplains on
post, social service agencies and a support group of military wives
have offered help to survivors. A memorial service was scheduled
for next Wednesday.
   ``There's a tremendous amount of shock and grief (but) there has
been no recrimination from any of the people we have talked to,''
said Adams.
   Thirteen of the dead, most of them infantrymen, were in the
Blackhawk that had been flying in formation. The other victims were
crew members in the second copter.
   The Blackhawk, one of the Army's newer helicopters, normally is
operated with a crew of three and can carry 11 combat-equipped
soldiers.
   It is a utility and assault aircraft designed for air cavalry
and medical evacuations, said Maj. Phil Soucy, an Army spokesman in
Washington, D.C.
   Soucy said there had been no move by safety investigators to
ground the Blackhawk fleet as a result of the accident.

   A 70-year-old man known as the ``Father
of the Iditarod' pocketed $2,500 in silver ingots today for being
the first to reach the half-way point of the 1,100-mile Iditarod
Trail Sled Dog Race.
   Joe Redington of Knik reached the Cripple checkpoint at 5:40
a.m. His nearest competitor, Herbie Nayokpuk of Shishmaref, checked
into Ophir, 55 miles behind Redington, at 11:10 p.m. Wednesday.
   Redington, a founder of the mushing marathon from Anchorage to
Nome, now heads for the Sulatna Crossing and then to Ruby on the
Yukon River. He has raced in all but two of the 16 Iditarods,
finishing three times in fifth place.
   Four-time champion Rick Swenson of Two Rivers was running third.
He checked out of Takotna at 8:37 p.m. Wednesday. He was followed
by Joe Garnie of Teller, Jan Masek of Anchorage and DeeDee Jonrowe
of Bethel.
   Defending champion Susan Butcher of Manley was seventh.
   Several racers said that despite Redington's lead, Nayokpuk is
now the musher to beat because of his strong dog team.
   ``I think it's going to take us quite a while to gain that kind
of time back, unless he runs into some kind of situation up
ahead,'' Swenson said.
   A blizzard pounding Alaska's southwestern coast threatened to
turn into complicate things on the Iditarod trail for the racers.
If the gale-driven snow reaches inland to the Iditarod Trail, the
going could turn slow.
   At the back of the pack, 290 miles behind the leaders, the
oldest Iditarod musher announced that he was dropping out of the
race. Norman Vaughan, 82, said three of his dogs were in heat and
he had whiteout conditions ahead.
   Another musher, Ray Dronenburg of Trapper Creek, also scratched
Wednesday, saying several of his dogs were weak with a virus. That
leaves 50 mushers in the race, which started Saturday.
   A $30,000 first prize awaits the winner, who is expected to
reach Nome sometime next week. The next 19 finishers will split the
rest of the $150,000 purse.

   U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said today he
supports trying out a needle-exchange program for drug addicts in
the United States to slow the spread of AIDS.
   While stressing that he was not proposing such a plan but rather
supporting others who call for it, Koop said drug abuse was the
likeliest way AIDS, or aquired immune deficiency syndrome, could
spread through the heterosexual population.
   ``I think we should have a pilot program in the United States,''
he said in an interview during the First International Conference
on the Global Impact of AIDS. About 1,000 health specialists from
63 countries are attending the three-day meeting, which opened
Monday at London's Barbican Center.
   Under needle-exchange programs in Europe, drug addicts can turn
in used needles for new ones, reducing the risk of contracting AIDS
from contaminated drug equipment.
   Koop acknowledged that many people object to such schemes as
abetting illegal drug abuse. ``We have to decide whether or not the
risk of AIDS from needle-sharing is great enough to satisfy that
objection,'' he said.
   ``If needle exchange could contain the epidemic, nobody should
be against it,'' Koop said.
   He said pilot projects should be conducted in more than one city
and mentioned as possibilities New York and Los Angeles. He said a
nationwide program shouldn't be considered until results of pilot
programs in the United States and other countries are studied.
   A pilot project is proposed for New York, but Koop criticized it
for using volunteer methadone users. Methadone is a substitute used
to wean addicts off heroin, and the volunteers, having made the
commitment to quit drugs, should not be exposed again to using
needles, he said.
   Also Wednesday, Dr. Manuel Carballo, chief of social and
behavioral researcher for the World Health Organization's Global
Program on AIDS, outlined the organization's strategy for slowing
the spread of the disease. Dr. Jonathan Mann, director of the WHO
program, was to have given the speech but was unable to attend the
final day's session.
   Discussion focused on how to reconcile control of the disease
with individual freedom and on international and national policy on
AIDS and its prevention.
   A 33-nation Gallup International survey on attitudes toward AIDS
presented to the conference Wednesday said that 47 percent of
respondents in the United States favor testing the entire
population for AIDS.
   Koop said he was ``totally opposed'' to mandatory screening,
arguing that only a tiny fraction of the population behaved in a
way that courted risk.
   Apart from North America, some parts of South America and some
Asian countries, concern among individuals about contracting AIDS
is relatively low, the survey found.
   ``As far as becoming an epidemic was concerned, throughout the
world there was a clear realization that this was likely to occur
in the case of homosexuals, hemophiliacs, intravenous drug users
and promiscuous people,'' the survey says.
   ``In terms of the risk of catching the disease, most of the
peoples of the world were aware of the clear situations in which it
could be caught,'' it added.
   But the survey says substantial minorities in many parts of the
world do not understand how the disease is transmitted and said
they would refuse to work with a person carrying the AIDS virus.
   ``There is a fear that one can get AIDS by means which are not
supported by scientific practice, for instance sharing a drinking
glass or via insect bites. ... Other perceived risks, such as ...
coughs and sneezes, friendly kissing ... appear to be
identified...''
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer. It is spread through sexual contact, needles
or syringes shared by drug users, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

<HEAD>Pentagon Says Soviets Shipping Arms to Nicaragua at Fast Pace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is continuing to ship arms to
Nicaragua at a fast pace despite efforts by the U.S.-backed Contra
guerrillas and Sandinista government to negotiate a peace accord,
the Pentagon said Thursday.
   During the first two months of 1988, the Nicaraguans received
3,100 metric tons _ or 3,400 regular tons _ of weaponry and war
materiel worth an estimated $100 million, the Pentagon said.
   The equipment was delivered in 10 arms shipments in January and
February, the Defense Department said.
   If that pace is sustained, the Nicaraguans will receive at least
18,600 metric tons of weaponry this calendar year, compared with an
estimated 21,700 metric tons delivered in 1987.
   Last year's arms deliveries to Nicaragua were valued by the
Pentagon at $505 million and arrived in 62 shipments.
   The January-February estimates are contained in an unclassified
assessment of the Nicaraguan military buildup that is updated
periodically by the Defense Department for administration leaders.
It was released on request by the Pentagon's public affairs office.
   Including the latest estimates, the Pentagon maintains the
Nicaraguan government has received arms valued at more than $2.4
billion since calendar year 1980.
   The new update was prepared at a time when President Reagan is
working with lawmakers to fashion an aid program for the Contra
guerrillas. U.S. aid to the Contras was cut off Feb. 29 after the
House refused to endorse an administration plan for military and
humanitarian aid and then rejected a Democratic alternative to
provide just humanitarian aid.
   It also comes during a period of rising doubt about the future
of peace negotiations. Nicaraguan leader Daniel Ortega has
dismissed Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo as a
mediator in the talks, and the Contras have said they need more
time to consider some of the Sandinista proposals.

<HEAD>Shultz Sees `Political Miracle' In South Korea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said
Thursday that South Korea has accomplished a ``political miracle''
in its peaceful transition to civilian rule.
   ``I think the Korean situation is one we've all watched very
closely and worked on hard,'' he told members of the House foreign
operations appropriations subcommittee. ``And in (South) Korea they
have managed to put a political miracle alongside their economic
miracle.''
   However, Shultz said later that it would be bold to predict when
U.S. troops could be withdrawn.
   He said President Chun Doo-Hwan ``engineered this change and
takes considerable pride in being the first leader of Korea to pass
the leadership to somebody else in a peaceful transition of power.
So it's a major and important event.''
   He promised U.S. support to the new government,
   Shultz was asked about reports that the 40,000 U.S. troops could
be withdrawn by 1990. He replied that he thought no date could be
set.
   The United States would like to see more stability in the Korean
peninsula, he said.
   ``But there is a very militaristic North Korea, whose
performance has been terrible,'' he went on.
   Shultz said there was ``quite compelling'' evidence that North
Korean intelligence was responsible for blowing up an airliner.
   Progress is most likely by taking small steps such as exchanging
family members, he said, adding that the holding of the Olympic
games in Korea will also be a positive element.

   Richard Gephardt opened a ``full force''
drive in Michigan Thursday, two days after finishing a poor fourth
among Democrats on Super Tuesday, and said, ``If we don't do well
here obviously we aren't going to be able to continue in this
race.''
   Most of the other Democratic presidential candidates were in
Illinois campaigning for that state's primary, which is next
Tuesday. And Gephardt, too, was joining the others in Chicago
Thursday night at a dinner and town meeting.
   But he said as he arrived for a rally on the Michigan Statehouse
steps, ``Our real thrust, our real force is going to be in
Michigan.''
   Michigan's Democratic caucus is March 26.
   ``We have a long road to go,'' Gephardt said. ``Let's go the
next step. I think Michigan is going to be a real test of every
campaign. We're going to do well in Michigan and when we do we'll
be right back in the middle of this.''
   Gerphardt, fighting against talk that his campaign may be
nearing an end, held up a copy of Thursday's Wall Street Journal
which said he had failed the test of a successful candidate.
   ``I think The Wall Street Journal is dead wrong,'' he declared.
   He met with legislators and local Democratic officials in a
state where he said his message will be well received.
   Earlier in the day, he campaigned in South Carolina, which holds
caucuses on Saturday.
   While the other Democratic presidential hopefuls have spent most
of the week focusing on delegate-rich Illinois, Gephardt is trying
to portray Michigan's voting as the next major test of the
Democratic campaign.
   ``We're going to be there in full force,'' Gephardt said.
``After that, we'll see where we are and where we go.''
   In Michigan, said deputy campaign manager Joe Trippi, ``we need
to win it or at least come in second to Jesse,'' a reference to
Jesse Jackson.
   Trippi said as many as 70 paid staffers would be sent to
Michigan by next week, compared to roughly 20 staffers in Illinois.
   ``We'll take virtually every organizer we have,'' he said.
   ``We had our bad day on Super Tuesday, but now we're back and
we're still in the middle of this race,'' Gephardt said.
   Gephardt rejected any comparisons with New York Rep. Jack Kemp,
who dropped from the Republican presidential race earlier Thursday.
   He pointed to his strong showings in several early contests,
including victories in Iowa and South Dakota, and said he has the
backing of 80 members of Congress, most of whom will be delegates
to the Democratic National Convention this summer.
   ``Unlike Jack Kemp, I have been in the middle of this race from
the beginning,'' Gephardt said. ``I have a delegate count that is
within striking distance of being back in the leadership.''
   Throughout the day on Thursday, Gephardt continued to hammer at
the central theme of his campaign, talking tough on trade. That's
designed to appeal in South Carolina, where the textile industry
has been damaged by foreign competition, as well as in Michigan
with its auto industry.
   The United Auto Workers Union, a major force in Michigan
Democratic politics, is remaining neutral, but Gephardt aides said
they anticipated getting support from union locals and
rank-and-file members because of his trade and economic positions.

<HEAD>Three East Germans in Truck Smash Border Barriers at ``Bridge of
Spies''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRIEDER REIMOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three East Germans crashed a flatbed truck through
steel barriers and roared over Glienicker Bridge into West Berlin
on Thursday in the first escape of its kind over the famed ``Bridge
of Spies,'' officials said.
   Bernd Puhlmann, who drove the truck in the high-speed escape to
the West, said a Soviet soldier on the East German side of the
bridge took aim at the vehicle but did not fire.
   Pulhmann said he thought that empty propane tanks that had been
loaded onto the truck may have accounted for the soldier's
reluctance.
   ``Because the soldier didn't know what was in the tanks, he
probably did not dare to shoot,'' the 37-year-old Puhlmann told
reporters.
   Puhlmann said he and his two friends decided while drinking beer
about midnight to make the escape.
   Two hours later, the 7{-ton truck plowed through two East German
metal gates and a chainlink fence before racing onto the Glienicker
Bridge, which has been made famous by numerous East-West spy
exchanges.
   The truck sped across the bridge, smashing through another East
German-built chainlink fence and tearing off a steel control gate
in West Berlin before coming to a halt, police said.
   With the truck demolished, the three escapees got out uninjured
and called West Berlin authorities, said a West Berlin police
spokesman who asked not to be further identified.
   ``This is the first time that anyone has broken through those
barriers,'' said another police officer.
   Glienicker Bridge connects Potsdam, East Germany with West
Berlin. Potsdam is on Berlin's southwest outskirts.
   The truck's impact tore the 4-foot-high steel gate on the West
Berlin side of the bridge off its foundation and twisted the
barrier into a half-circle.
   Wrecked barriers could be seen on the East German side of the
bridge as well.
   Metal, glass, plastic and motor oil from the truck were strewn
across the area.
   The demolished truck sat with its engine compartment smashed and
bumpers dangling.
   Puhlmann said he, Gotthard Ihden, 37, and Werner Jaeger, 28, all
of Potsdam, decided to try the escape because they were
dissatisfied with political conditions in communist East Germany.
   West Berlin officials said the three may face charges of
destroying property and driving dangerously.
   Among the most famous spy swaps on the bridge was the Feb. 10,
1962 exchange by the United States of convicted Soviet KGB master
spy Col. Rudolph Abel for Francis Gary Powers, whose U-2
surveillance plane was shot down over the Soviet Union.
   Many refugees fled over the bridge to West Berlin after the East
German workers' uprising in 1953, but the barriers there had never
been breached.

<HEAD>Government Urged To Move Against Fraud, Shoddy Work at Clinical
Labs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government needs to step up its
supervision of clinical laboratories in order to end widespread
fraud and cut the rate of dangerous and sometimes fatal
misdiagnoses, Congress was told Thursday.
   ``Fraud, gross overcharging, kickbacks and poor quality of care
are rampant in this industry, and federal oversight has been
non-existent,'' said Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the
House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and
investigations.
   Dingell said there is a ``pervasive pattern of highly
questionable financial arrangements between laboratories and
doctors,'' with lab inducements ranging from cash discounts and
``frequent flyer'' mileage to paying the salaries of doctors' aides.
   Some witnesses cited 20 percent to 40 percent error rates in Pap
tests, which detect cervical cancer in women, as an example of the
dangers in unregulated lab procedures.
   Shirley Greening, representing the American Society for
Cytotechnology, said labs have adopted a ``Paps for Profit''
mentality under which technicians' salaries have stagnated while
their workloads have increased to dangerous levels.
   ``Some cytotechs screen 200 to 300 slides a day or more. This
means looking at one Pap smear slide every one and a half
minutes,'' she said. ``Screening at this high-production pace
produces fatigue and leads to careless errors.''
   Other problems include piecework pay systems that encourage
production at the expense of careful diagnosis, she said, and
``considerable pressure'' to accept inadequate specimens and call
them negative so doctors won't send their business to another lab.
   Greening and others recommended mandatory proficiency testing
for all diagnostic lab technicians, workload limits, more federal
money to monitor labs through the Medicare and Medicaid programs,
and required public disclosure of lab caseload volume, staffing,
fees, quality control methods and results.
   Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon said one lab was
billing the state Medicaid program $14 for a complete blood
chemistry test. After the investigation, he said, the price dropped
to $2.30.
   Investigators have recovered $1.5 million through settlements,
Shannon said, and Massachusetts Medicaid is expected to save up to
$700,000 a year due to the lower prices.
   Shannon said such billing practices were a nationwide problem.
   Dingell cited several federal investigations, including one
still in progress, which have found fraud and kickbacks involving
hundreds of doctors and millions of dollars in southern California,
Philadelphia and elsewhere.
   He said the profession has become so lucrative that ``a
convicted bank robber is now involved in the operation of one
Southwest lab, who has exclaimed you can make more money in the
operation of clinical labs than you can from robbing banks.''
   There are about 12,000 federally regulated labs in the country,
about 6,700 located in hospitals. Several hundred thousand
facilities are not federally regulated, many of them in physicians'
offices.
   Dingell said the market for clinical lab testing is estimated at
$20 billion a year, and 40 percent of that is federally funded
through Medicare and Medicaid.
   He said representatives of the lab industry would be heard from
at a later date.

<HEAD>Prince Charles Escapes Avalanche, But Friend Killed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KLOSTERS, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince Charles escaped an avalanche
while skiing today, but the snowslide killed one of his friends and
injured another.
   Buckingham Palace identified the dead man as Maj. Hugh Lindsay,
a former equerry, or aide, to Charles's mother, Queen Elizabeth II.
A woman in the party, Patricia Palmer-Tomkinson, suffered leg
injuries, the palace said.
   The palace said Charles was not injured. But witnesses said the
prince looked distraught, and one said he was weeping and shaking
as a helicopter arrived to pick him up.
   Charles' wife, Diana, and Sarah Ferguson, his pregnant
sister-in-law, were not on the slopes at the time, the palace said.
   Swiss authorities said the snowslide on Mt. Gotschnagrat near
Klosters began about 300 feet above a group of six skiers that
included Prince Charles. The prince and three other people were
unharmed.
   The palace said the party was skiing off the main ski run and
was stationary when the avalanche began at 2:45 p.m.
   ``All members of the party were in a position to take avoiding
action with the exception of Maj. Lindsay and Mrs.
Palmer-Tomkinson, who were both caught in the avalanche,'' it said.
   Lindsay, 34, was a serving army major and a friend of Charles
and Diana. He was married to a Buckingham Palace press secretary
who was expecting a baby, the palace said.
   Peter Balsiger, editor-in-chief of the Zurich-based newspaper
Blick, was quoted as saying he was told Charles, 39, helped dig one
person out of the snow.
   The palace statement said a Swiss guide and members of the royal
party helped dig the victims free. It did not say whether Charles
was among the diggers.
   A French photographer told BBC radio he saw Charles being
comforted by someone as a helicopter took off with a stretcher.
   BBC TV news said the queen was understood to have spoken to the
family at the chalet where they gathered after the tragedy.
   The 1988 Good Ski Guide describes the run where the accident
occurred as ``a slope of awesome steepness, dropping about 500
meters (yards).''
   Prince Charles skied the area many times during his bachelor
days and is credited with giving Klosters its exclusive tag.
   The guide says: ``Prince Charles is no doubt pleased to have put
(it) behind him; mercifully it is rarely open.''
   ``They (avalanches) are extremely difficult to predict. That is
what makes them so dangerous,'' said Peter Cliff, an Alpine guide
and leader of the Cairngorm mountain rescue team in Scotland.
   The most common is the snow-slab avalanche, when snow driven by
wind creates a crusted surface, underlaid with air pockets, and is
liable to fracture across the entire width of a slope.
   Without warning, massive slides can be set off by temperature
increases, new falls of snow or skiers and climbers.
   The royals arrived in Switzerland on Tuesday.
   Charles, Diana and the Duchess of York, who is married to
Charles' younger brother Prince Andrew, posed for photographers at
Klosters on Wednesday for photographers. The 28-year-old duchess,
the former Sarah Ferguson, is expecting her first baby in August.

<HEAD>Jackson Supporters Mobilizing Black Vote in Illinois</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Illinois blacks will deliver their primary vote
almost exclusively to favorite son Jesse Jackson next Tuesday, but
black leaders credit the monolithic vote to Jackson's charisma and
not a Daley-style political machine.
   Jackson, who has had his differences with the black hierarchy in
his adopted hometown of Chicago, doesn't need a machine to ensure
the black vote, observers say.
   ``This is a movement vote that is bigger than the capabilities
of any ward committeeman or political organizer,'' said Don Rose, a
longtime Chicago political consultant who predicts Jackson will win
up to 95 percent of the black vote in the Illinois primary.
   But Jackson's supporters are working hard to mobilize that vote
and _ more importantly _ to make sure supporters realize the
necessity of also voting for Jackson's slated convention delegates
in Illinois.
   Illinois' beauty pageant primary is separate from the election
of 173 delegates to the Democratic National Convention.
   Jackson is fielding full delegate slates in only 17 of the
state's 22 congressional districts. He is one delegate short in
four other districts and has no slate in the nearly all-white
suburbs on Chicago's northwest side.
   The black vote alone won't be enough to give Jackson a victory
in the Illinois primary _ and may not be enough to lock up second
place, Rose said.
   He predicted the black vote would amount to between 23 percent
and 25 percent of the entire Democratic vote in Illinois. ``If he
gets 10 percent of the white vote, that would give him 30 percent
and make it unlikely for him to carry the state,'' Rose said.
   ``Right now, there is a tremendous fervor in the community for
Jesse after the outcome of Super Tuesday,'' said Chicago Alderman
Danny Davis, a black leader and Jackson supporter. ``I've heard
people ... talking about how it was the second coming.''
   Jackson returned in triumph Wednesday to Chicago, his political
base for nearly two decades, reminding voters, ``I am a charter
member of the underclass, the son of a teen-age mother who was the
daughter of a teen-age mother. I was able to break the shackles.''
   Jackson rose to national prominence from Chicago's predominantly
black South Side where he started a civil rights group called
Operation PUSH in the early 1970s.
   He owns a home in a middle-class Chicago neighborhood and
regularly returns to PUSH headquarters to speak at the group's
weekly Saturday meetings, which often take on the flavor of a
church revival meeting.
   Davis and other political observers predicted that Jackson's
Chicago political base would help him win about 95 percent of the
black vote in Illinois and up to 10 percent of the white vote _
roughly the proportions he won in the Super Tuesday primaries.
   But they say he'll carry the black vote without relying on the
type of ward-boss political machine that has permeated Chicago
history, most recently under the late Mayor Richard Daley.
   ``There is not a black political machine in the formal sense,''
said Rose, who worked for the late Mayor Harold Washington, the
city's first black mayor.
   ``There is a mobilized black vote _ the product of the Harold
Washington years,'' Rose said Wednesday. ``Jesse is able to pull it
together and he will deliver an overwhelming black vote of 90
percent to 95 percent.
   ``But that's not the product of anybody's machine,'' Rose said.
``That's a product of Jesse's charisma and popularity among black
voters.''
   Jackson had the support of Washington in 1984 and of current
Mayor Eugene Sawyer this year. But he and Washington were largely
allies of political convenience, and Jackson actively backed
another black alderman over Sawyer in the political fighting that
followed Washington's death last November.
   East St. Louis Mayor Carl Officer, a longtime Jackson supporter,
will deliver the Democratic contender the bulk of the black vote in
that Southern Illinois city, said several Jackson supporters.
   Jackson also will be counting on the black church, long a
political base for him, to help mobilize voters, Chicago Alderman
Tim Evans said. On Sunday, he said, black ministers throughout the
city likely will preach to their parishioners to vote for Jackson.

   A family of musicians demanding to be flown to
London set off a bomb aboard an Aeroflot jet and killed four people
before an assault team stormed the plane and shot dead five of the
hijackers, Tass said today.
   The hijackers carried weapons and explosives aboard the plane in
their instruments, the official Soviet news agency said. In
addition to the nine dead, 20 passengers were reported injured in
Tuesday's hijacking of the Tupolev-154 plane, Tass said.
   Tass identified the 11 air pirates as members of a family
musical ensemble from Siberia known as the Ovechkins. It gave no
information on their motives.
   The hijackers set off the bomb while the plane, with 76
passengers, was on the ground near Leningrad, Tass said.
   The government newspaper Izvestia said one of the hijackers died
in the explosion. The newspaper said the surviving air pirates then
killed their leader, identified as their mother, and that two of
them committed suicide.
   The hijackers seized the plane Tuesday as it was headed to
Leningrad after a stop in the Ural Mountains city of Kurgan. The
flight began in the Siberian city of Irkutsk.
   Tass reported the incident on Wednesday, but gave few details.
It was the second hijacking of a Soviet domestic flight in 1{ years.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Richard Gilbert said today that the
embassy had been told no Americans were aboard.
   The Sovietskaya Rossiya daily reported today that the cockpit
crew had been relayed a message from the hijackers that they were
to proceed to London.
   ``The pilots reported what happened to ground control,'' Tass
said. ``They were told that a refueling was needed to meet their
demand and the airliner made an unscheduled landing.''
   Tass said a special assault team boarded the plane after it
landed and that the hijackers opened fire.
   ``The bandits managed to set off an explosive device in the
airliner's tail section. The plane caught fire,'' the agency
reported. ``An air hostess and three passengers were killed as a
result of the act of terrorism.''
   Other passengers were evacuated, but 20 were injured and were
hospitalized, Tass said.
   ``Five of the 11 criminals were killed,'' it stated, without
giving details. Radio Moscow said the other six would be tried in
court.
   ``The bandits were the Ovechkins, a family musical group from
Irkutsk'' in Siberia, Tass said. ``Eyewitnesses pointed to three
leaders among the criminal team _ Vasily and Oleg Ovechkin and
their mother, Ninel Ovechkin, a plump, fashionably dressed woman of
over 50.''
   Tass said they brought their weapons aboard in their instruments.
   Sovietskaya Rossiya explained that the incident transpired over
the course of the afternoon.
   The jet, which can carry up to 168 passengers, took off from
Kurgan at 1:08 p.m. Moscow time, the paper said. Shortly before 3
p.m., when the plane was nearing Leningrad's Pulkovo airport, one
of the people aboard demanded that senior flight attendant Tamara
Zharkaya take a note to the cockpit.
   The note said: ``We demand that you change course. Fly to
London. Otherwise we'll blow up the plane along with the
passengers,'' the newspaper reported.
   The crew kept their heads, the paper said. Pilot Valentin F.
Kupriyanov calculated how much fuel was left, then landed at an
unidentified airfield near Leningrad.
   ``After landing, the crew entered into negotiations with the
bandits, asking them to give up their criminal intentions and not
to endanger passengers' lives,'' the newspaper said.
   But the hijackers refused to listen, it said.
   ``Several hours of negotiations had no result,'' the newspaper
said.
   ``Under these conditions, the only decision that could be taken
was to render the criminals harmless,'' said Sovietskaya Rossiya.
   Radio Moscow said: ``In the shooting aboard the plane, most of
the hijackers were killed, and the others were captured. They are
to be tried in court.''
   The last airliner hijacking attempt reported in the Soviet Union
was on Sept. 20, 1986, in the Ural Mountains city of Ufa. Media
reports said the hijackers were armed members of the internal
security forces. The reports said that five people, including two
of the hijackers, were killed when authorities stormed the plane.
The others were tried and sentenced.
   Tuesday's hijack was at least the third fatal incident this year
involving an Aeroflot jet.
   On Jan. 18, a Tu-154 crashed at the Caspian port of Krasnovodsk,
killing 11 and injuring at least 12.
   A Tu-134 carrying 51 people crashed on Feb. 27 while landing at
the Siberian city of Surgut. Tass said there were victims but gave

   Reports on aviation accidents and disasters were rare until
about two years ago, when Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
embarked on a campaign for more open discussion of social and
economic problems.
   A Civil Aviation Ministry official said in November that
Aeroflot would begin reporting all injury accidents this year.

<TEXT>
   Security police on Thursday questioned the
editor of a church-sponsored magazine after he charged that some
voters were intimidated by the government in recent primary
elections, a colleague said.
   During the Feb. 22 elections, voters were required to line up at
polling places behind their candidate or someone representing him.
   Chief Editor Bedan Mbugua called the system ``a mockery of
democracy'' in Monday's edition of Beyond magazine, which is
sponsored by the National Council of Churches of Kenya. He charged
that some voters were intimidated by administration officials into
voting for certain candidates.
   Ibrahim Omondi, associate editor of Beyond, said Mbugua reported
to security police, but no details of the investigation were
available.
   The general secretary of the Kenya African Nation Union, the
country's sole legal political party, acknowledged mistakes during
the primary, but he accused Beyond of sloppy and unfair reporting.
   ``It is one-sided and self-serving,'' Burudi Nabwera said at a
news conference. ``It is difficult to understand how the magazine
could have drawn conclusions after looking partially at only five
constituencies.''
   General elections on March 21 will be by secret ballot.

<HEAD>Former Top Education Official Calls College Education `A Bargain'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former top federal education official has
some news for parents struggling with college tuition bills.
   Harold Howe II, who was U.S. education commissioner from 1965-68
under President Lyndon B. Johnson, says that at $12,000 a year, or
roughly $60 a day during the academic year, a college education is
``a bargain.''
   Howe, writing in the March 9 issue of the Chronicle of Higher
Education, offered what he called ``an incomplete list'' of all the
things that $60 buys, including:
   _``A room and bath (often semiprivate) and three meals, plus
heat and electricity.''
   _``A variety of free or low-cost cultural, social and sports
events as well as extracurriculars.''
   _``Special student facilities for socializing and meeting
members of the opposite sex.''
   _``What amounts to a club membership for recreation, including
swimming, tennis, golf (except in cities) and other sports.''
   _``Access to ... libraries, laboratories, museums, field trips
and guest lectures.''
   _``The services of an army of food-service, clerical and other
non-academic employees.''
   _``The personal attention of faculty members with a wide range
of skills and knowledge, whose main job is to pass on what they
know to their students.''
   _``Free advice from a distinguished group of presidents,
provosts, deans and other functionaries who believe that colleges
should turn out graduates with both a moral compass and a body of
knowledge.''
   ``That's not bad for $60 a day,'' said Howe, who is now a senior
lecturer at Harvard University's Graduate School of Education.
   He said students get all that ``for a daily fee that might get
you a night _ but no meals _ in a Holiday Inn.''
   In addition to providing all these services for students,
``colleges do great things for society,'' Howe said, citing studies
that have found ``college graduates pay more taxes, are more likely
to vote, have a lower divorce rate, volunteer more often for good
works in their communities and are less likely to go to jail.''
   Howe said Secretary of Education William J. Bennett, who has
often accused colleges of being overpriced and underproductive,
should consider changing ``his tune and (urging) colleges to raise
tuition, so that the goose that lays the golden eggs can continue
to do so.''
   Instead of responding to Bennett with ``salvos about inadequate
faculty salaries (and) increasing maintenance costs,'' college
presidents should point out ``what a bargain a college education is
today,'' Howe suggested.

   A 15-year-old boy was convicted of
second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison today for
beating a classmate to death with a baseball bat so he could see
what it was like to kill someone.
   Rod Matthews showed no reaction when the verdict was announced
and his sentence immediately imposed. The verdict, issued at 2:10
p.m., followed nearly 10 hours of deliberation over two days.
   The victim's mother sobbed as the verdict was announced, and
Matthews' mother sat silently with lowered head.
   Matthews' mental state was the focus of closing arguments
Wednesday in Norfolk Superior Court.
   The jurors began their work after Judge Roger J. Donahue
explained again the various possible convictions available and
outlining the basis for acquittal by reason of insanity.
   Prosecutors, who were seeking a first-degree murder conviction
for the Nov. 20, 1986, slaying, depicted Matthews as a
dispassionate murderer who plotted for weeks to lure 14-year-old
Shaun Ouillette to a secluded area ``to find out what it was like
to kill somebody.''
   Defense attorney John Philip White, calling for acquittal by
reason of insanity, called Matthews an irrational, ``diseased
intellect'' who appealed for help before the killing but was
ignored by a teacher and friends.
   Matthews, tried as an adult, had faced a mandatory sentence of
life imprisonment without parole if convicted of first-degree
murder. If found guilty of second-degree murder, the maximum
penalty is life imprisonment with a chance of parole in 15 years.
   If Matthews had been found innocent by reason of insanity, he
would have been evaluated by the state Department of Mental Health,
White said.
   District Attorney Peter Casey portrayed Matthews as a troubled
youth who was prompted to kill by his own desires, not by mental
illness.
   ``He did that because he doesn't care about anybody,'' said
Casey, who repeatedly jabbed an accusatory finger at Matthews
during closing arguments. ``What did it feel like? It was
deliberate. ... He really wound up and hit him about the head.''
   Matthews chose Ouillette as the victim after rejecting two other
classmates as targets because two of his friends objected, Casey
said.
   Ouillette, who moved to Canton with his family about two years
before the slaying, was selected because Matthews felt he would not
be missed, according to testimony during the week-long trial.
   Matthews said he had plotted the killing for a month to
experience what killing someone was like, according to testimony
from two classmates who were shown the body by Matthews before a
pre-Thanksgiving pep rally.
   Ouillette's body was discovered in December 1986 after one of
the youths sent police an anonymous letter. None of the teen-agers
who knew of the slaying faces prosecution.
   White depicted Matthews as a highly unstable youth whose use of
Ritalin, a drug used mainly to control hyperactivity in children,
may have exacerbated his already unstable state.
   That contention is a smoke screen, Casey said, citing medical
experts' testimony that Ritalin does not permanently alter behavior
or trigger violence or hallucinations in normal doses.
   White also said Matthews unsuccessfully sought help prior to the
slaying in a letter to a teacher in which Matthews described his
desire to kill and light fires.
   ``Had they said, `No, don't kill Shaun Ouillette,' in all
likelihood Shaun Ouillette would not have been harmed,'' said White.
   The trial was attended each day by the victim's and defendant's
families and dozens of residents of Canton, a middle-class
community of 17,000 people about 15 miles south of Boston.
   The case has been compared to the 1982 trial of Anthony
Broussard, then 18, and sentenced 25 years to life in San Jose,
Calif., for killing his girlfriend the year before.
   Broussard, who was tried as an adult, took at least 13
schoolmates to see the victim's body. The movie ``The River's
Edge'' was based on that case.

<HEAD>Cuban Penal System Has Positive, Negative Aspects, Group Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA </BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cuban prison system is generally
constructive and humane for cooperative inmates but metes out
``harsh and cruel'' treatment to those who reject rehabilitation
programs, according to a report released Thursday.
   The report was prepared by the Institute for Policy Studies, a
liberal research group based in Washington which sponsored a visit
by a six-member delegation to Cuba from Feb. 26 to March 5.
   The delegation, which visited six prisons at various locations
around the island and conducted more than 120 ``confidential''
interviews, said it found a number of ``constructive aspects'' to
the Cuban system:
   _The great majority of prisoners work a regular work week at
productive jobs under conditions similar to those of ordinary
workers. Many acquire practical skills during confinement and have
opportunities to advance their education.
   _Almost all the prisoners who work are paid, receiving the same
rate as civilians except for certain discounts to cover cost of
living.
   _The regular prison facilities were all clean and hygenic, there
were no complaints of the use of ``instruments of torture'' and a
system of conjugal visits was well established.
   But the report also found that prisoners who resist re-education
or violate prison discipline are confined for extended periods, at
times in ``extremely harsh punishment cells _ bare, tiny, dark,
cold (or hot, depending on the season) _ sometimes with not enough
food.''
   One delegation member, Aryeh Neier, said the cells were five
feet by seven, had no bedding, only a primitive sanitary system and
housed three prisoners each.
   The delegation said it had heard reports of a few prisoners who
wore no clothes or only undershorts and shoes.
   Some prisoners who refuse to work are allowed sun only once a
week for an hour or two and are confined to iron cages too small to
take walks, the report said.
   Until recently, uncooperative prisoners were allowed visits only
once every six months but the delegation said new rules have
reduced this to once every 60 days, the report said.
   But a Cuban exile, Reinaldo Lopez Lima, who said he spent 23
years in Cuban prisons, told Neier during the news conference that
he spent eight of those years without a family visit. He described
prison conditions as ``terrible'' and said he knew of a dozen
prisoners who were killed early last year shortly before his
release.
   Under questioning, Neier said he was satisfied that the
delegation got an ``unfettered look'' at the Cuban prison system.
He said it would have been difficult for Cuban authorities to
restrict the delegation to ``showcase'' areas reserved for foreign
visitors because he had maps drawn for the delegation by former
prisoners.
   The visit came at a time when the Reagan administration is
making a concerted effort at the U.N. Human Rights Commission in
Geneva to make Cuba an agenda item at the 1989 commission session.
   In a speech to the commission on Tuesday, the U.S. ambassador to
the United Nations, Vernon Walters, said that Cuba has more than
200 prisons and labor camps and that there may be between 10,000 to
15,000 political prisoners.
   He said that a group of long-term political prisoners who have
refused rehabilitation began a hunger strike a week ago ``to
protest Havana's attempts to misinform the world about prison
conditions, torture and other mistreatment.''
   Neier noted that Amnesty International, a London-based human
rights group, claims to have the names of 600 political prisoners
and said he believes the actual number in that category is only
somewhat higher.
   The report said that the delegation interviewed at least 50
political prisoners, most of whom the group had selected in advance.
   The visit was undertaken at the suggestion of the Institute for
Policy Studies. In exchange, IPC agreed to seek similar access to
U.S. prisons by a delegation of Cuban legal experts.

   Rock star George Michael has credited
the wife of Democratic presidential candidate Albert Gore Jr. with
helping boost his album sales past 10 million.
   ``No doubt a few of those American sales came from Tipper Gore's
efforts,'' Michael said Thursday in a statement released by his
publicist, Phil Lobel.
   Mrs. Gore has spoken against obscene lyrics in rock 'n' roll
music.
   Michael said he has been notified that his ``Faith'' album,
which contains the hit single ``I Want Your Sex,'' has sold more
than 10 million copies worldwide.
   ``Perhaps now she can help sell a few thousand more records
since her husband won big in the primaries,'' Michael said in
Perth, Australia, where he is performing.
   Gore, a U.S. senator from Tennessee, won in six states during
the Super Tuesday primaries.
   ``As Americans like to say, there was much hoopla about
nothing,'' Michael said about the lyrics in the song. ``It was,
after all, just a pop record.''

<TEXT>
   The Nicaraguan Contras on Thursday dropped a demand
that had blocked peace talks with their homeland's Marxist
government, agreeing to the open agenda proposed by the Sandinistas.
   The rebel group made the announcement at a news conference here
where its leaders bitterly criticized the United States for cutting
off Contra aid.
   ``The United States has once again abandoned an ally,'' said
Adolfo Calero, one of six directors of the Nicaraguan Resistance.
``But we have been abandoned before. We will continue our efforts.''
   Calero said the rebels will now accept the proposed open agenda
for talks in Sapoa, Nicaragua, and suggested the talks begin March
16.
   ``We are ready to go to Sapoa,'' said Calero, who will head the
delegation.
   He said the Nicaraguan Resistance, as the Contras are formally
known, would no longer insist that the agenda include a program
hammered out during talks mediated by Nicaraguan Cardinal Miguel
Obando y Bravo in Guatemala last month. That included a 30-day
truce, political amnesty, press freedoms, an end to the draft, and
a dialogue with the opposition.
   The Contras proposed instead that the Sandinistas allow the
``internal opposition'' to attend the talks, but stopped short of
saying they would insist on that condition.
   The change in the Contras' position came one week after a Reagan
administration proposal to continue funding the rebels lost in a
close vote in the U.S. House of Representatives on March 3.
   Calero called the United States ``an inconsistent and
impermanent'' friend, in contrast to the Soviets, who support the
Sandinistas.
   He and fellow director Aristides Sanchez said the aid cutoff
might eventually hurt troops in the field, but insisted their
morale was still high.
   ``We will never surrender,'' said Calero.
   The Sandinistas have previously accepted Contra demands that
Obando y Bravo, whom the Nicaraguan government dropped as mediator,
attend the Sapoa talks as a witness.
   The Contras, in turn, accepted Organization of American States
head Javier Baena Soares as a second witness.
   Calero said Thursday that in previous communications the
Sandinistas have ``given every guarantee'' of the Contra
delegation's safety inside Nicaragua.
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega had proposed the Sapoa talks
begin March 9, but the Contras begged off, saying they were only
notified the night of March 7.
   Last week, they asked instead for a meeting in Costa Rica to
discuss details of the talks, but Thursday's proposal made no
mention of a preliminary meeting.
   Calero said he had kept the United States _ which he referred to
as ``our ally, in quotes'' _ informed of the talks.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pop singer Andy Gibb, younger brother of the three
members of the Bee Gees rock group, died today in an Oxford
hospital after developing stomach pains, his record company said.
He was 30.
   A spokesman for Island Records Ltd. who spoke on condition he
not be identified said he could not release the cause of death.
   ``He was 30 years old. He was taken ill with stomach pains on
Monday and was admitted to hospital for observation and then he
died this morning,'' the record company said in a statement. ``The
reason for death has yet to be announced.''
   A spokesman for John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, 52 miles
northwest of London, confirmed Gibb died there at 8:45 a.m.
   ``I can't give you any further information than that,'' said
Colin Weston, the hospital's duty administrator.
   The record company spokesman said the Australian-born Gibb,
younger brother of Robin, Maurice and Barry who make up the Bee
Gees, signed a contract with Island Records two months ago and was
due to work on a new album this spring.
   Gibb's hit songs include ``I Just Want To Be Your Everything,''
in 1977, ``Shadow Dancing'' and ``An Everlasting Love'' in 1978 and
``(Our Love) Don't Throw It All Away'' in 1979.
   Gibb's manager, Robert Stigwood, said in New York he was ``very
sad and deeply distressed, and sorry. I have been in touch with his
parents and brothers. I will miss him.''
   Gibb's Miami lawyer, John Kozyak, said he received word of
Gibb's death from the Miami manager of the Bee Gees.
   ``This is really a shock,'' Kozyak said. The last time I saw
him, he looked perfectly healthy to me. He was playing tennis.''
   Dick Ashby, the Bee Gees' representative in Miami, said Gibb's
mother, Barbara Gibb, was with him when he died.
   Gibb lived in a penthouse apartment at Venetia on Biscayne Bay
in Miami.
   Last October, court papers filed in connection with Gibb's
bankruptcy proceedings in Miami showed Gibb earned only $7,755 in
1986 and lived rent-free while playing guitars loaned him by his
brothers.
   Kozyak said an investigation was under way into Gibb's death.
   ``The doctor was going to talk to him this morning and arrange
more tests, and he simply died,'' he said.
   Gibb, who co-hosted TV's ``Solid Gold'' in 1981 and 1982, had
six hit records in the late 1970s.
   He was born in Australia but had lived in the Miami area for
several years.
   Gibb got the Venetia apartment in exchange for promoting the
plush condominium complex. He had appeared at various celebrity
charity events around south Florida, including pro-celebrity tennis
matches in Miami and Fort Lauderdale.
   But he suffered financial setbacks in recent years and filed for
bankruptcy last September. At that time he estimated his debts at
more than $1 million and his assets at less than $50,000.
   Gibb had been in London about a month. Kozyak said Gibb's
bankruptcy was discharged from Miami federal court in January and
all of Gibb's debts were settled.
   Since then, Gibb ``was back on his feet and in good spirits and
trying to put together a record contract,'' he said.

   A seventh-grader was expelled and a
classmate was suspended for 30 days for making at least three
``homemade bombs'' and bringing them to school, allegedly to get
back at a teacher, officials said Thursday.
   The Boone County Board of Education took the action against the
unidentified boys following hearings March 1 and 2, school
officials said. A third youth had been suspended for 10 days but is
back at the Madison Middle School.
   Two bombs were found hidden in a restroom ceiling, and testimony
at the hearings indicated the third was detonated somewhere outside
school, Principal Joe Tagliente said Thursday.
   The containers found hidden in the ceiling contained some kind
of fuel mixed with gun powder, Tagliente said.
   ``According to the testimony, one of the boys had a problem with
a teacher and was mad at him, and the student brought the bombs to
school to blow up his car,'' Tagliente said. ``The student denies
saying it.''
   Superintendent Kenneth Mabe said one youth was expelled for the
rest of the school year and banned from school property. The second
was suspended for 30 days and placed on probation the rest of the
school year, he said. Both were required to seek counseling.
   Both were accused of manufacturing the devices, Tagliente said.
   The third student was not accused of making the bomb but was
allegedly involved in the plot, he said.
   No criminal charges have been filed against the youths.

<TEXT>
   A nationwide sweep of Mafia suspects has
led to 96 arrests, authorities said Thursday.
   More than 1,000 members of various agencies were trying to
execute 160 arrest warrants for suspects in cities from Palermo in
Sicily to Milan in northern Italy, authorities said.
   Prosecutors in Palermo said Thursday they began the
investigation in April based on statements by Antonio Calderone,
who was arrested at that time in an investigation of the so-called
Alleruzzo gang of Mafiosi that operated near Mount Etna in Sicily.
Magistrates were also acting on statements made by other Mafia
informants, the prosecutors said.
   The Italian news agency ANSA said the crimes cited by Calderone
included the killing of police Col. Giuseppe Russo and ambush of
Gen. Carlo Alberto dalla Chiesa, the prefect of Palermo and Italy's
top Mafia fighter. His 1982 murder prompted an investigation that
led to a 1985 anti-Mafia sweep with 200 arrests.
   ANSA said Calderone also told authorities about the role of
small crime families that operate on the flanks of the large Mafia
groups in the cities.
   Italian news agencies said an unspecified number of people named
in the latest arrest warrants were already in prison for other
crimes.

<HEAD>Hart Poised To Leave Presidential Race Second Time</HEAD>

   Gary Hart, who three months ago re-entered the
Democratic presidential race to ``let the people decide,'' has
gotten the message and will call it quits on Friday, sources said
Thursday.
   The former Colorado senator polled no more than 5 percent of the
vote in the Super Tuesday primaries and won no convention
delegates. The day after the primaries, the Federal Election
Commission announced Hart no longer was eligible for further
federal matching funds.
   His departure from the race, expected to come at a Friday
morning news conference in Denver, will mark his second departure
from the 1988 Democratic race.
   At a highly charged news conference last May 8, a defiant Hart,
at the time considered the Democratic front-runner, quit the race
following published reports about his relationship with Miami model
Donna Rice.
   When he rejoined the race in December, Hart immediately shot to
the top of the polls. But pollsters cautioned Hart's numbers could
be traced to name identification rather than support and early
contests bore that out _ Hart finished last in crucial early races
in Iowa and New Hampshire.
   Sources speaking only on condition of anonymity said Hart would
not endorse any of the surviving contenders when he makes his
withdrawal announcement.
   In Lansing, Mich., George Sallade, co-chairman of Michigan
Friends for Gary Hart, said Hart's speech scheduled for Friday to a
Michigan State University political science class had been
canceled. He said he expected a withdrawal announcement.
   ```What this shows is that the American people expect the
occupant of the White House to be saintly,'' Sallade said.
   The Hart campaign suffered an additional blow when Colorado Gov.
Roy Romer and state Democratic Party Chairman Buie Seawell threw
their support behind Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis on
Wednesday. Both previously had been Hart supporters, and Seawell
once headed Hart's Senate office in Washington, D.C.

   Many people would like to see students
perform community services, and a bill in the Legislature would
require all Michigan high school students to do that to graduate.
   Critics of the measure say students should concentrate on
academics, such service should be voluntary, and the state
shouldn't intrude on local control of education.
   The bill introduced Wednesday by Sen. Jerome Hart would require
students to perform 40 hours of community service over the last
three years of high school. It also would let them earn at least
one-half course credit if they performed an additional 50 hours of
service.
   Rhett Johnston, an aide to Hart, said about 5 percent of the
schools nationwide require community service as a condition of
graduation. About 28 percent of the nation's 74,000 public high
schools offer elective course credit for volunteer work.
   ``Community service offers our young people the chance to
discover, develop and display talents and skills they rarely use in
school and it also provides hard-pressed community social agencies
a corps of hard-working, dedicated and compassionate volunteers,''
Hart said.
   ``It's pretty widespread,'' said Barbara Gomez, director of
school-sanctioned youth community service programs for the
Washington-based Council of Chief State School Officers, which
represents state school superintendents.
   ``It's a grass-roots effort that's filtering up to the state
level. There seems to be a big movement on voluntary service. ... I
don't think it's something that is going to go away.
   ``Our stance is that it's another way of learning. ... What goes
on in the classroom is not the only way a child can learn,'' Gomez
said.
   Two school districts in Michigan _ Detroit and Bloomfield Hills
_ require community service to graduate. Paid part-time jobs
satisfy the requirement in Detroit.
   ``You require what you value. We think this is a valuable
experience,'' said Gary Doyle, deputy superintendent for the
affluent Bloomfield Hills school district. ``Reaching out and
helping others gives students a better sense of self.''
   But some education officials don't like the idea.
   ``It should be determined locally. If it's going to be a
mandate, we would probably oppose it,'' said Don Elliott, executive
director of the Michigan Association of School Administrators.
   ``It may well be a good idea, but it should be something that
each school district should consider on its own,'' said Justin
King, executive director of the Michigan Association of School
Boards.
   ``Our position is any graduation requirement should be (a matter
of) local control,'' said Carl Cohen, president of the Michigan
PTA. ``We think that community service should be something that
everybody should want to do.''

   Corporate sponsors have rebuffed Elizabeth Taylor's
gala to raise money for AIDS care and research, making it unlikely
the benefit will reach its $3 million goal, organizers said.
   ``We would have liked to have had a major corporate donor shake
Elizabeth Taylor's hand and present her with a large check, but I
couldn't get anybody,'' said Jane Fincher, who is in charge of
obtaining corporate donations for the Sunday event ending at the
Fontainbleau Hilton hotel on Miami Beach.
   But only three corporations have given $60,000, said Al Evans,
chairman of the Community Alliance Against AIDS, a fund-raising arm
of the University of Miami School of Medicine and co-sponsor of the
event.
   ``We were led to believe that (the corporations) cared,'' Evans
said. ``But they're still not brave enough.''
   More than $1.5 million has been raised through pledges and
donations, he said.
   On Sunday, celebrities will be co-hosts at 15 $2,500-a-plate
dinners in south Florida. Proceeds will be split between the
University of Miami School of Medicine and the American Foundation
for AIDS Research, led by Miss Taylor.
   Committed guests for Sunday include Miss Taylor, model Cheryl

Bolt ``embarrassment and distress'' with its August 1987 article.
   The magazine quoted press releases attributed to a spokesman for

   Crews delicately
dismantled the pedal-powered plane Daedalus on Thursday and packed
it up for the start of a journey to Greece, where the 70-pound
aircraft will attempt a record 74-mile flight over the Aegean Sea.
   Pilots rolled the plane, which resembles a monstrous pink
dragonfly, onto the tarmac at the Dryden Flight Research Facility,
where it sat in stark contrast to the giant 747 shuttle piggyback
jetliner at the NASA facility.
   Engineers then separated the Daedalus wings, packed the aircraft
into a container and loaded it into a moving van. A planned
demonstration flight was called off because of high winds in the
Mojave desert, 65 miles north of Los Angeles.
   Daedalus will travel to Masachusetts and will leave for Athens
aboard a C-130 transport on March 23. The target date for the
flight attempt is March 30.
   The aircraft has been undergoing tests in Southern California
since October in preparation for the Greek islands flight. The
route, originally designed to duplicate the mythological Daedalus'
route from Crete to the Greek mainland, was changed slightly to
ensure lighter winds.
   Greek mythology dictates that Daedalus became the world's first
mortal to fly when he manufactured wings of wax and feathers.
According to the story, his son, Icarus, died because he flew too
near the sun and the wax melted.
   The Daedalus was designed and built by a team of students,
faculty and alumni from MIT. It will be pedaled between Crete and
Santorini by one of five world class bicycle racers currently in
training.
   If successful, the flight could last up to seven hours and would
break the distance record for human-powered flight set in January
1987, when the Eagle experimental airplane flew 37.2 miles over the
Mojave Desert.
   The previous record was set in 1979 when the Gossamer Albatross
crossed the English channel.
   The Daedalus can travel at an altitude of 15 feet with a top
speed of 14 mph and stretches 30 feet from propeller to tail. The
pilot sits in a plastic cocoon, dangling from a 112-foot long
styrofoam wing. A 10-foot propeller spins four feet from the
pilot's face.
   When in flight, the temperature in the cockpit increases 20
degrees because of the exertion of the pilot. Designers feel they
have until May 15 to make the record attempt. After that, the
weather will be too hot.
   The pilot will be selected by lottery.
   One of those in training, Greg Zack, 26, of Wilmington, N.C.,
said he was physically prepared.
   ``It would be a big bummer if I didn't go,'' Zack said. ``The
whole project has been a team thing though, so no one will be
flying alone. I can live with it if I'm not flying it.''
   He added, ``It's a funny plane to fly. It's a lot of fun.
There's not much to it, really. You can look around and enjoy
flying. You aren't busy with the controls.''
   Heat and winds are the only adversaries, he said. ``If there are
gusts more than 5 mph, then you try to guess where it is going to
take you and try to keep control,'' Zack said.
   The other potential pilots are Frank Scioscia, 27, Scranton,
Pa.; Glenn Tremml, 28, New Haven, Conn.; Erik Schmidt, 25, Boulder,
Colo.; and Kanellos Kanellopoulos, 30, Vrahneika, Greece.

   At first, Louisiana's chief financial
officer was amused by a phony memo bearing his name that told state
employees to limit their restroom time or face some surprising
reminders.
   In the March 1 memo, a ``Restroom Trip Policy'' is outlined ``to
provide a consistent method of accounting for each employee's
restroom time and ensuring equal treatment of all state employees.''
   ``All restroom stalls are being equipped with timed paper roll
retractors,'' the memo said. ``If the stall is occupied for more
than three minutes, an alarm will sound. Thirty seconds after the
alarm sounds, the roll of paper in the stall will retract, the
toilet will flush and the stall door will open.''
   But after his initial amusement, Brian Kendrick, the state's
commissioner of administration, started thinking about how the memo
was being spread, and whether that meant the state could economize
on some office machinery.
   ``If we can find out where those copies are starting, we'll go
in and take out some copiers,'' he said.
   ``If I had a dollar for every copy that's been made, I could
have probably solved the state's money problems,'' Kendrick said
Wednesday. Louisiana faces a budget deficit projected as high as
$200 million.

   Trevino, 42, won the Republican primary Tuesday, but doesn't

   ``He said, `How about Lee?' I said, `No, my name is Loreto.' He
said, `Well, I'll just call you Lee,' and it stuck,'' Trevino said.

   The drug-taking and sexual partners of
AIDS-infected people would be told they're at risk of catching the
deadly disease under a bill introduced in the New York Legislature.
   The measure says doctors should have the power, without threat
of legal penalty, to inform people in danger even over the
objection of those infected with AIDS. The bill doesn't
specifically allow doctors to use the names of the AIDS-infected
people when informing intimates, but it does give physicians the
right to use their discretion.
   The legislation, unveiled Wednesday, also would require that
counseling and education services be made available to people being
tested for AIDS and for those close to them who are at risk of
catching the disease.
   Also under the bill, blood testing for exposure the HIV virus,
which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome, would be limited
to people who voluntarily agree and give written authorization to
be tested.
   According to sponsors, the legislation would restrict release of
the results of AIDS tests without a person's consent to the
individuals being tested and to professionals directly involved in
the medical care of that person. Some information could be
exchanged by public health and social services agencies, sponsors
said.
   ``The bill protects confidentiality, protects the information,
except to deal with an identified and legitimate health concern and
treatment necessity,'' said state Assemblyman Richard Gottfried,
chairman of the Assembly's health committee. ``You would not notify
everybody in the neighborhood (of the presence of AIDS). You would
not notify somebody's fellow workers.''
   Sponsors say the bill would limit discrimination against people
with AIDS, the HIV virus or with AIDS-related complex in
employment, housing, credit transactions and other areas.
   A violation of the disclosure rules would carry a misdemeanor
criminal penalty of up to one year in jail under the bill, which
also would establish improper disclosure as grounds of a civil
lawsuit.
   Current state laws require physicians to inform people when they
are at risk of getting certain sexually transmitted diseases such
as syphilis. The legislation proposed Wednesday would make AIDS
notification optional for doctors, and it would also give doctors
the right to ask public health officials to do the notifying
instead.
   Tim Sweeney, deputy director for policy of the New York
City-based Gay Men's Health Crisis, said that a ``strong
confidentiality bill can enhance public health and civil
liberties.''
   New York state, with 14,000 AIDS cases, has the nation's highest
incidence of the disease. AIDS is caused by a virus that damages
the body's immune system. It is spread most often through sexual
contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood
or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who was twice acquitted of charges he
violated Oak Park's handgun ban has sued the community and several
of its officials for $2.5 million.
   In the lawsuit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court, Don
Bennett accuses the suburban village, several officials and police
officers of conspiring to harass him and violate his constitutional
rights to free speech, due process and equal protection under the
law.
   Bennett, 45, a resident of the nearby Hanover Park, formerly
owned a gas station and minimarket in Oak Park.
   Bennett's attorney, Michael D. Johnson, said Bennett sold his
business in July after he was harassed by the village and its
officials because of his outspoken opposition to the ban on
handguns.
   The Oak Park attorney, Raymond Heise, said he had not received a
copy of the lawsuit, but he denied the allegations.
   ``If Mr. Bennett interpreted that enforcement as harassment,
that's his interpretation,'' he said. ``I don't know any day that
he wasn't free to operate his business.''
   On March 26, 1986, Bennett was charged with violating the
handgun ban after he chased and shot at two people who robbed his
gas station. Bennett was acquitted that fall.
   The lawsuit contends a police officer told Bennett the following
day to stop talking with the news media about his case, Johnson
said.
   Bennett was charged with a second violation of the handgun ban
on Feb. 23, 1987, accused of brandishing a firearm while dealing
with an unruly customer. He was later acquitted of that charge,
too, Johnson said.

   The sole resident of this unincorporated
town has been fatally shot in the country store he tended for 42
years, and a man paroled from prison three weeks ago has been
charged with his murder.
   William Mellin, 70, was shot in the back of the head Tuesday
night, officials said.
   David Ray Wareham, 41, who had worked at the store since his
parole Feb. 18, was arrested an hour after the shooting and is
being held without bail on murder charges, officials said. He also
was charged with the attempted murder of a witness to the shooting,
whom police refused to identify.
   Wareham apparently went to work at the stide 25 percent of the funds
for the giant atom
smasher.
   Herrington said that should the United States fail to build the
physics research center, there could be a ``brain drain'' of
mammoth proportions, as U.S. scientists go abroad to work on the
best equipment.
   He urged Congress to help the United States take the lead in
high-energy physics ``and let the brain drain happen in other
countries.''
   The subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Tom Bevill, D-Ala., pressed
Herrington to get financial commitments from foreign nations before
Congress votes further money for the project.
   ``Unless we can get allocated another billion dollars pretty
soon and start it ... we could not possibly initiate the funding,''
Bevill said. ``But if we had assurance 50 percent or 75 percent
would be contributed by other countries, it would be a whole new
game.''
   Herrington, however, said it was up to the United States to act
first in order to draw foreign participation.
   Rep. Carl Pursell, R-Mich., said he was worried that depending
on some foreign nations, such as Japan, for funds would endanger
U.S. commercial and security interests.
   The project ``may be pure physics in itself, but there are
results that will translate into the industrial and strategic
area,'' said Pursell, whose district contains one of seven proposed
sites for the super-collider.
   President Reagan has proposed $363 million for super-collider
construction in 1989, but critics in Congress oppose such high
spending on grounds it would divert money from other important
research projects.
   The research center would include a 53-mile-around atom smasher
to study the effects of high-speed collisions of subatomic
particles.
   Backers of the project contend it would produce practical
technological benefits into the next century.
   Bevill, however, said $6 billion in large, federally backed
research projects have been discontinued the past five years.
   ``That isn't a good track record,'' he said. ``When you make
mistakes on a small research project, that is one thing, but when
we look at the size of this, it shocks us.''
   Besides Michigan, six other states have sites that remain in
competition for the project, which will produce 3,000 jobs and have
an annual operating budget of $279 million.
   The states are Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, North Carolina,
Tennessee and Texas.

   A Marine embassy guard who for a time figured
prominently in last year's Moscow spy scandal will leave the
military next month, the Marine Corps said Thursday.
   Cpl. Arnold Bracy, 22, of Woodside Queens, New York City, will
be formally discharged on April 4, the corps said. A Marine
official who asked not to be named said Bracy would receive an
honorable discharge.
   Bracy served as an embassy guard in Moscow with Sgt. Clayton J.
Lonetree, 26, who was convicted last August of passing classified
information to Soviet agents after becoming involved with a Russian
woman.
   For a time last spring, Bracy also faced a military
court-martial because Navy and federal agents were convinced he had
conspired with Lonetree and allowed Russian KGB agents inside the
embassy late at night to roam at will.
   Those allegations were based in part on a confession signed by
Bracy after a lengthy interrogation. Bracy later recanted that
statement, saying it had been coerced, and all charges against him
were dropped when military lawyers concluded they did not have any
corroborating evidence to prosecute.

   Former Black Panther Johnny Spain was
freed on bail today after 21 years in prison for murder in
connection with a bloody, aborted 1971 escape attempt from San
Quentin Prison.
   Spain, 38, whose two murder convictions were reversed, arrived
at the front gate of the California Medical Facility shortly after
noon to receive congratulations from friends and supporters.
   ``I feel great,'' he said. ``What this has meant in terms of 21
years in prison, it has been a very terrible and difficult time. I
won't let anyone down who has supported me and there have been many
who supported me.''
   On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson ordered
Spain, released on $350,000 bail pending a hearing on the state's
appeal of the overturning of the convictions in the slaying of two
guards during the escape attempt.
   Friends prepared to post the bond, but Vacaville officials
decided not to release him immediately because they had not
received the necessary papers from the state parole board and the
judge who ordered him freed.
   Arguments are scheduled for Monday in the state's appeal of
Henderson's 1986 order of a new trial for Spain in the ``San
Quentin Six'' case.
   ``Mr. Spain is entitled to sit and watch that argument and hear
the rest of his life debated before him,'' lawyer Dennis Riordan
said in asking Henderson for Spain's immediate release.
   The bail ruling was the second court victory in as many days for
Spain, who was imprisoned being arrested in 1966 for a murder and
robbery in Los Angeles.
   On Tuesday, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Kathleen Parker
ordered Spain paroled immediately from the sentence he has been
serving for the 1966 murder.
   Spain apparently joined the Black Panther Party after entering
prison. He later became the only inmate convicted of murder in the
bloody San Quentin escape attempt that killed militant leader
George Jackson, two other prisoners and three guards.
   Authorities said Spain, who was seen running out of a
maximum-security unit with Jackson, conspired with Jackson in the
attempted breakout.
   The other members of the San Quentin Six were either convicted
of lesser charges or acquitted.
   In reversing Spain's convictions and granting him a new trial,
Henderson said Spain had been denied a fair trial by being required
to wear heavy shackles for every court appearance during the five
years of proceedings.
   In December, the state Board of Prison Terms rejected Spain's
request for parole, saying he was unsuitable for release.
Henderson, however, ordered a new hearing, finding that the board
had violated his previous order not to consider the overturned San
Quentin convictions in its deliberations.
   On Feb. 11, the board voted 2-1 to grant Spain parole in 1989. A
dissenting board member asked for review by the full nine-member
board, which is scheduled March 21.
   Spain's lawyers said he would live in San Francisco and work as
an electrician while his case is on appeal. Henderson's order
allows him to travel within the state and visit his wife, whom he
married while in prison, and two young sons in Los Angeles.

<HEAD>Bill Would Encourage Standardized Plant Designs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a bid to revitalize the flagging nuclear
power industry, 14 members of Congress introduced legislation
Thursday to encourage standardized plant designs and streamline the
government's regulatory force.
   Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead, R-Calif., said the bill provides the
``means to assure that the nuclear power option is preserved for
the future.'' It is co-sponsored by eight Republicans and five
Democrats, most of whom serve with Moorhead on the House energy
subcommittee that will initially consider the bill.
   The legislation would reorganize the five-member Nuclear
Regulatory Commission into a ``Nuclear Safety Agency'' headed by a
single administrator _ a step already approved by a Senate
subcommittee and favored by a majority of the NRC commissioners
themselves. All other federal regulatory agencies are headed by
just one boss, and the NRC's commission format has long come under
fire from industry and Congress as too cumbersome.
   Unlike the Senate measure, Moorhead's bill would take the
additional step of authorizing one-stop licensing of future nuclear
plants if they are built to standard, state-of-the-art designs.
   Currently, nuclear plants must be licensed in several stages,
from the start of construction to the actual production of power
years later. That is necessary, in part, because most U.S. plants
have been built to ``custom'' designs _ different from any other _
and hence must be given more scrupulous review.
   Moorhead's bill would encourage the new safety agency to license
both the construction and operation of any plant, subject to normal
inspections, which adheres to pre-cleared designs. The system would
be similar to those used in France and Japan, both of which rely
heavily on nuclear power and produce it more cheaply.
   Enormous costs, safety concerns and the lengthy, complicated
licensing process are among factors blamed for the moribund state
of the U.S. nuclear industry. Though 110 plants are now in
operation and a few are still under construction, no utility has
even applied to build a new plant since 1978.
   NRC Chairman Lando Zech and even some critics of nuclear power
have long argued for plant standardization on both safety and
financial grounds. Some American firms say they now have the
technology to design ``meltdown-proof'' reactors, which, if
standardized, would be less expensive _ perhaps by more than half _
than the plants that now require containment structures and massive
backup safety systems.
   Moorhead, noting that the U.S. Geological Survey has just cut
its estimate of undiscovered oil in the United States by 40
percent, said it is ``undeniably clear that in the 1990s and
beyond, this country will have inadequate supplies of electricity.
Instead of having oil buried in the ground, it now appears that we
have had our heads buried. It's time we face the facts quickly and
develop alternative energy supplies.''
   Rep. Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla., pointed to an example in his own
state as evidence of the advantages offered by plant
standardization. The St. Lucie 2 power plant, built to the same
specifications as its sister, St. Lucie 1, recently was licensed
for operation after $1.5 billion in construction costs, he said.
   ``In contrast,'' Bilirakis continued, the Long Island Shoreham
plant, which is the same size as St. Lucie 2, cost more than $5
billion. If we can keep nuclear plant construction costs below $2
billion by building the same design only twice, he said, ``imagine
what we can save if we build a standardized plant many times over.''
   ``We rely on nuclear power for nearly 20 percent of our electric
generation,'' said Bilirakis. ``Yet, the construction of nuclear
power plants is at a standstill. The volatile situation today in
the Persian Gulf points out that we simply must continue to develop
domestic energy sources to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.
Safe, reliable nuclear power is the means at hand to do just that.''

   Contra rebels freed a U.S. peace
activist they had held for nine days, turning him over to members
of his Witness for Peace organization, the group's local director
said Thursday.
   Edward Griffin, the head of Witness for Peace here, said
activist Richard Boren was released Wednesday night near the
isolated town of Quilali, 187 miles north of Managua.
   In a telephone interview, Griffin said Boren, 30, a volunteer
from Elkin, N.C., ``had a cold and was very tired, but otherwise
was fine.'' He said he got news of Boren's release by radio from
other volunteers working in the area.
   No definite time was set for his arrival in Managua.
   Boren was seized along with 12 Nicaraguans March 1 when ``Contra
troops forced him out of a private home at gunpoint,'' said Witness
for Peace, an organization based in Durham, N.C.
   The group is made up of American volunteers opposed to the Regan
administration's continued support of the Contra rebels in their
6-year-old fight to overthrow Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista
government.
   On Tuesday, the government filed a diplomatic note of protest
with the U.S. Embassy against the Contra abductions. The
Sandinistas claimed 12 men were taken by the Contras, Witness for
Peace said there were 13.
   Boren was the second American Witness for Peace member seized by
the Contras. The first was Paul Fishcer, who was abducted in
October in central Chontales province and held for two weeks.
   Witness for Peace officials in North Carolina and Washington
also announced Boren's release.
   On Monday, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department said Contra
leaders in Washington and Florida had agreed to release Boren as
soon as the rebels could do so safely in front of reliable
witnesses.

<HEAD>Austria Recalls Annexation by Hitler 50 Years Ago</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Kurt Waldheim, himself accused
of war crimes, apologized on Austria's behalf Thursday for
atrocities Austrian Nazis committed after Adolf Hitler made his
native land part of Germany 50 years ago.
   ``We must not forget that many of the worst Nazi hangmen were
Austrians,'' he said in a TV speech. ``There were Austrians who
were victims and others who were perpetrators. As head of state of
the republic of Austria, I wish to apologize for Nazi crimes
committed by Austrians.''
   About 15,000 Viennese gathered for a rally outside City Hall on
the first of four solemn days marking the ``Anschluss'' of March
11, 1938, when German troops marched into Austria and were greeteed
by cheering crowds.
   Among the speakers were survivors of concentration camps and
Paul Grosz, who leads Vienna's community of 6,000 Jews.
   Austria's Jews ``cannot forget'' that 65,000 were killed by the
Nazis and many more thousands had to flee, Grosz said. ``We should
never let that stain of shame on the history of this city be
forgotten,'' he declared.
   Security was tight because of a bomb scare early Thursday.
Police removed cars parked nearby two hours before the rally began.
City officials prepared thousands of black ribbons bearing the
words ``50 Years, March 1938, Never Again.''
   An exhibit called ``Vienna 1938'' has been mounted at City Hall.
There are similar displays about the Nazi era at Linz, where Hitler
spent his youth; Salzburg, Innsbruck and Graz, where the Nazi
swastika was raised over the city hall even before German troops
arrived.
   Dozens of events are planned during the four days.
   Waldheim canceled a speech he was to have made at the official
government ceremony Friday _ some prominent Austrians had
threatened to stay away otherwise _ and substituted the televised
address Thursday in which he spoke of ``the avalanche of
suffering'' after annexation.
   He did not mention his own service in Hitler's army or a report
last month on his conduct as a lieutenant in the Balkans from 1942
to 1945.
   An international panel of historians, appointed by the
government at Waldheim's request, said he was in ``close
proximity'' to war crimes, knew of them and did not try to stop
them. The historians said they found no proof that he committed war
crimes, but left the question of guilt open.
   In his 12-minute speech Thursday, the former U.N.
secretary-general indicated again that he will not leave office
until his term expires in 1992. He announced plans for a ``moral
renewal'' program to counter disillusionment among young Austrians
about public service.
   At the rally, Grosz told the young: ``You are not the prisoners
of an evil past, because if you know it you are free to form the
present and the future creatively.''
   Hundreds of thousands of Austrians joined the Nazi party after
cheering German soldiers who poured across the border March 11-12,
1938, made Austria part of the Third Reich.
   Huge crowds welcomed Hitler when he entered his homeland in
triumph. By then thousands of Jews, intellectuals, Socialists and
Austrian nationalists had been jailed in a roundup overseen by SS
chief Heinrich Himmler.
   The Nazis said 99 percent of Austria's voters approved the
annexation in a nationwide referendum in April 1938.
   Austrians as both victims and perpetrators of Nazism was a theme
running through all pronouncements of major public figures as the
anniversary observance began.
   Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said in an interview with Western
news agencies that Austrians should learn from the past rather than
focusing on Waldheim.
   In a survey conducted for a television documentary, 47 percent
of 150 Austrians polled late last year said annexation brought both
good and bad results. Only 15 percent of those polled said it was
entirely bad.
   After 1918, when Austria lost its vast empire, politicians of
all parties had argued for union with Germany as a way to rescue
the economy and preserve the nation's German culture. The
enthusiasm of many wanted when Hitler gained control of Germany in
1933.
   Vranitzky said an important lesson of the 1930s was that
divisions between political parties never should be so deep again.
   After World War II, the past was suppressed the official view
came to be that Austria was Hitler's first victim. The controversy
over Waldheim's wartime past has prompted a much more thorough
investigation of the past.
   Mayor Helmut Zilk, unveiling a plaque to Vienna politicians who
died in concentration camps, said Thursday some Austrian ``victims
very quickly searched for victims of their own'' after 1938.
   ``We must openly admit this disgraceful fact and we should not
try to minimize it or play it down by a comparison with other
countries,'' he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican union members, against the wishes
of their leaders, appear to be embracing the presidential candidacy
of Kansas Sen. Bob Dole despite his poor record on labor issues.
   Democrats far outnumber Republicans in organized labor. And
Democratic union members, like Democrats in general, have yet to
unite behind any of their party's candidates.
   But Dole, despite having what has been called one of the 20
worst voting records in the Senate on labor issues, is the clear
favorite of union members who say they are Republicans _ about
about one-fourth of the 19 million union members in the nation.
   Dole, for example, garnered 53 percent of the Republican union
vote in Tuesday's 12 Southern primaries, according to exit polls.
   But with only 1 percent of the Republican vote in the Southern
primaries coming from union households, their support for Dole was
no more than a drop in the bucket as Vice President George Bush
swept the region.
   Bush received 28 percent of the Republican union vote in the
Super Tuesday primaries, followed by former television evangelist
Pat Robertson with 22 percent and Rep. Jack Kemp of New York with 6
percent.
   Labor political strategists see primarily two phenomena at work
in the strong support for Dole and in Bush's weak showing among
their Republican members.
   ``Dole is perceived incorrectly as less elitist, more moderate
and more of a regular guy,'' said Jerry Clark, political director
of the 1 million-member American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees.
   ``Except on a few things like food stamps that affect
agriculture, his voting record on our issues is terrible,'' Clark
said.
   The other factor is Bush's identification with President Reagan,
who despite the AFL-CIO's vehement opposition, received about 45
percent of union members' votes in the 1984 general election.
   Rex Hardesty, a spokesman for the federation, contended Dole's
strong showing this year represents an anti-Reagan vote.
   ``The drumbeat of union publications that Reaganomics and
Reagan's conservative views should hold no appeal to trade
unionists is getting through,'' he said.
   Reagan had support from just two unions in 1980 _ the Teamsters
and the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization. Within a
year of his election, he fired 11,000 PATCO members for going on
strike and destroyed their union.
   The Teamsters endorsed Reagan again in 1984, but with much less
enthusiasm than in 1980. Later, the administration indicted their
president, Jackie Presser, on charges of embezzlement and launched
a legal effort to seize control of the union through a government
trusteeship, contending that it is dominated by racketeers.
   In reaction to the takeover attempt, the Teamsters sought refuge
in the AFL-CIO, rejoining the federation after a 30-year absence
and promising to not disrupt its political goal of putting a
Democrat in the White House.
   Although they are now unlikely to make a Democratic endorsement
before the party's convention next July, labor leaders have agreed
to unite behind whoever is the party's nominee.
   Joan Baggett, political director for the Bricklayers Union and a
Democratic Party activist, said labor leaders clearly prefer to run
against Bush, believing fewer of their members will cross over to
support him than did Reagan.
   ``Bush is now clearly linked with Reagan, and our members have
come to realize that Reagan has not been particularly good for
their interests,'' Ms. Baggett said.
   ``We don't want to run against Dole,'' she added. ``He has a
long voting record against our members' interests, but they don't
know that. It's partly because, that with our lower political
profile this year, we haven't told them.''
   Not everyone agrees.
   Dole drew fewer negative responses than any other candidate in
either party in a poll of members of the United Food and Commercial
Workers Union.
   ``If our members have a preference as far as Republicans are
concerned, they would much rather have Dole,'' said Allen Zack, a
UFCW spokesman. ``He's developed a reputation as being at least a
person you can deal with.''

   Amnesty International officials accused
Gov. Bob Martinez on Thursday of trying to rush the execution of
convicted killer Willie Jasper Darden, Florida's most-often
condemned man who is under his seventh death warrant.
   Officials of Amnesty International and other groups planned to
go to the state Capitol on Friday to ask Martinez to meet with
Darden's attorneys and listen to new evidence that they say could
clear the inmate of the murder of a Lakeland furniture store owner
in a $15 robbery.
   Supporters say Darden, who is black, was the victim of racial
prejudice in his trial.
   Darden's is the most-litigated case involving a death row
inmate, with nearly 100 judges involved in decisions. It has been
before the U.S. Supreme Court four times.
   The latest time before the Supreme Court was Monday, when the
court turned down his claim that he received an unfair trial.
   The next day, the governor signed a seventh death warrant for
Darden and set his execution for March 15. That gave the inmate's
attorneys less than a week to prepare his case. Usually, at least
30 days are allowed.
   ``I think the governor is looking for some kind of ritualistic
sacrifice that he can go through to prove he's tough on crime,''
said Magdaleno Rose-Avila, national director of Amnesty
International's campaign to abolish the death penalty. He noted
that the governor's popularity rating has been low in recent polls.
   The governor's spokesman said politics had nothing to do it,
since Martinez always has strongly supported the death penalty.
   ``The issues have been debated and resolved by the courts. There
was no reason not to sign the warrant,'' said press secretary Jon
Peck.
   Peck said Martinez had instituted a new policy recently to
schedule executions on subsequent warrants in 20 days, rather than
30 days, which he said would have put the execution near the Good
Friday and Easter holidays.
   ``It seemed like kind of an inappropriate time,'' Peck said.
   Joe Spicola, the governor's general counsel, said Darden had
exhausted all possible appeals. ``He is not going to abuse the
process any further,'' he said.
   Attorney Mark Olive said he did not know when he would be able
to file a last-ditch appeal on Darden's behalf.
   Amnesty International planned to organize supporters in Florida
and European countries to call or cable the governor's office
Friday to protest the execution.
   ``I think there will be public outrage like they've never seen
if they execute Willie Darden,'' Rose-Avila said.
   No other Florida inmate has survived as many death warrants, few
have been as celebrated and only one other inmate has been on
Florida's death row longer.
   When Martinez signed Darden's sixth death warrant earlier this
year, Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov, American actress Margot
Kidder and British rock star Peter Gabriel urged clemency. Sakharov
won the 1975 Nobel Peace prize for his defense of human rights in
the Soviet Union.
   Darden, 54, has been on death row since Jan. 29, 1974. A
prolific writer, he has been called the ``poet of death row.''
   Darden's supporters cite sworn statements from a minister and
another Lakeland resident saying he could not have been at the
furniture store when owner James Turman was killed.
   The Rev. Sam Sparks said Turman's wife had told him that all
blacks looked alike to her and that her identification of Darden
was unimportant because lawyers had told her Darden committed the
crime. Helen Baum, formerly Helen Turman, recently denied having
made that statement to Sparks and reaffirmed her identification of
Darden.
   Christine F. Bass, a Lakeland secretary, said Darden's car had
broken down near her home and he waited for a tow truck from 4 p.m.
to 5:35 p.m. on Sept. 8, 1973. Her house was eight miles from the
furniture store. Prosecutors say the crime occurred about 6 p.m.

   NASA officials warned Congress on Thursday
that the space station program would be destroyed if money is
diverted to build an unmanned scientific and manufacturing facility
in space.
   At the same time, the space station budget came under attack
elsewhere in the Capitol, when Rep. Edward P. Boland, D-Mass.,
pressed for more money for housing programs next year and said if
that money is not allocated, then Congress will ``kiss goodbye to
the space station.''
   Boland, whose House Appropriations subcommittee handles funding
for housing programs as well as independent agencies including the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said his panel would
take money for housing from the budgets for NASA and the National
Science Foundation unless Congress changes the overall budget
priorities.
   Boland said ``it would take $1.5 billion to restore'' the cuts
in housing funds to the level needed. Unless Congress finds another
source for those funds, he said, ``you can kiss goodbye to the
space station,'' new rocket boosters and other improvements in the
space program.
   In another part of the Capitol, Andrew Stofan, the retiring head
of the space station program in the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, said he would strenuously oppose any attempt to
take money from the space station budget to pay for a commerically
developed ``Industrial Space Facility.''
   NASA, which is under congressional and White House pressure to
make use of an unmanned scientific and manufacturing facility,
recently said it would seek to lease an orbiting laboratory for
five years at $140 million a year. Some congressmen want that money
to come out of space station funds.
   ``I see no use for it (the ISF) as far as developing the space
station is concerned,'' said Stofan, who is retiring after 30 years
with NASA. ``If the $700 million came out of developing the space
station, I would definitely say no.''
   Some NASA officials and members of Congress fear that forcing
the agency to accept the ISF or another facility like it is a move
by station opponents to kill the project altogether.
   Stofan testified at a hearing of the House space science
subcommittee, which is considering the administration's request for
$1 billion in the fiscal year that beings in October to start
construction of the space station.
   ``If we get less than the $1 billion we ask for ... we will have
a program, but not on the schedule we have today,'' Stofan said. He
said any skips in the schedule waste far more money than they save.
   After budget cutters got through, NASA's 1988 request for $767
million for the space station was cut to $425 million.
   ``That $350 million less will cost us $1.4 billion'' by the time
the station is completed,'' Stofan said. And, he said, it will
delay completion of the station by one year.
   He said any cut in the NASA budget will have disastrous results
just as the agency is trying to spring forward again from the
calamities that began with the explosion of the space shuttle
Challenger in 1986. NASA has requested $11.5 billion in 1989, an
increase of $2.5 billion over 1988.
   Rep. Jack Buechner, R-Mo., who is a member of the House budget
committee as well as the space science subcommittee, said he
thought NASA will get only a $1 billion increase.
   ``As we are standing on the springboard ready to dive in the
water, they are draining the pool,'' he said.
   The schedule, Stofan said, calls for the first elements of the
station to be launched in the first three months of 1995, it will
be ready for temporary visits by astronauts a year later and will
be completed in the first three months of 1998.
   Again and again, Stofan was asked by committee members about the
industrial space facility.
   He said the private Houston firm that is developing the facility
_ which would be carried into orbit by the space shuttle _ tried to
find commercial customers for it but couldn't. Under the NASA
proposal, the government would lease back 70 percent of the space.
   There is no advantage to building the ISF before the space
station is ready, Stofan said. He said it should be built only if
there is a commercial demand for it.
   Thomas Moser, director of the NASA's space station program
office, said the ISF would have only double the usefulness of
carrying a Spacelab in the shuttle's cargo bay. He said a
permanently manned space station would be 50 times as useful as the
ISF.

<TEXT>
   One of seven secret undergraduate
societies at Yale University has decided to admit women in 1989,
according to published reports.
   The move by the Scroll and Key will leave two secret clubs
off-limits to women, including Skull and Bones, whose alumni roster
includes Vice President George Bush and conservative columnist
William F. Buckley Jr.
   A group called Wolf's Head also does not admit women.
   Among Scroll and Key's alumni is A. Bartlett Giamatti, the
president of major-league baseball's National League and former
president of Yale, the New Haven Register reported Thursday. The
decision to admit women was reported by The New York Times and the
Register.
   The secret societies are exclusive social clubs that select
children of former members and other selected students for
membership in their senior year. The clubs meet in privately owned
buildings on or near campus and have individual initiation rites
and rituals.
   The societies have come under criticism; similar clubs at
Harvard and Princeton have been the targets of lawsuits.
   ``It creates a whole system of shooting people straight to the
top,'' said Byrony Romer, a sophomore and co-coordinator of the
Yale Women's Center. ``It is such a strong power base.''
   Scroll and Key, which was founded in 1842, is the second-oldest
of the Yale secret societies.

<HEAD>Documents Show Pipeline Payment Benefited Meese's Finances</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $150,000 payment to a friend of Attorney
General Edwin Meese III for work on an Iraqi pipeline project ended
up in a stock-trading account that was apparently used to benefit
Meese's finances, a published report said Thursday.
   The money, a legal fee intended for attorney E. Robert Wallach,
went through two accounts before being deposited in October 1985 in
a pooled account used to trade stocks on behalf of Wallach, Meese
and others, docments obtained by the Los Angeles Times showed.
   The discovery indicates the fees Wallach received for lobbying
the White House, with Meese's help, on the pipeline project were
later used to Meese's financial advantage, despite vigorous denials
by lawyers for both Meese and Wallach, the paper said.
   Meese played a key role in securing U.S. government support for
the Iraqi pipeline when he arranged a White House meeting between
pipeline promoters and former National Security adviser Robert C.
McFarlane and discussed the project with former Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres.
   Meese's lawyers denied Meese knew anything about the payment to
Wallach and said he had no way of knowing of any possible benefits
he might have received from the money.
   And George G. Walker, Wallach's attorney, told the Times, ``We
will categorically deny that any monies Mr. Wallach received ever
went into Mr. Meese's account or were used for his benefit.''
   But highly unusual stock-trading practices by W. Franklyn Chinn,
the financial adviser who managed both Meese's and Wallach's money,
suggest that Meese did benefit from trades made with the Wallach
fee, the newspaper said.
   A Swiss financier, Bruce Rappaport, who was the pipeline's chief
promoter said he deposited the $150,000 with Chinn, who controlled
accounts for Wallach and Meese at the time. Rappaport has said he
hired Wallach because of his Washington contacts, including Meese.
   The payment to Chinn was made less than two months after Meese
helped Wallach arrange a meeting between Rappaport and McFarlane on
June 24, 1985. McFarlane assigned a National Security Council aide
to find a way to insure the pipeline so that it could be financed
and built. The pipeline was never constructed.
   Chinn was able to pool the $150,000 with other funds and use the
money to buy blocks of stock. He then could allocate the most
profitable trades to Meese's account after learning how the deals
came out, according to a recent report by the Democratic staff of
the Senate Governmental Affairs oversight subcommittee.
   The Senate staff report concludes that nearly a third of the
stock purchases allocated by Chinn to Meese's account, called Meese
Partners, required more money than his account contained at the
time they were made.
   Over an 18-month period, Chinn was able to turn about $50,000
into about $95,000 through investments for Meese _ a return of
better than 80 percent.
   Last week in Geneva, Rappaport said the $150,000 was transferred
to Chinn's business account at the Bank of America in San Francisco
in August 1985 on instructions from Wallach.
   A government investigator who reviewed the financial records of
Meese, Wallach and Chinn said that on Aug. 15, 1985, Chinn
transferred $150,000 from his Bank of America business account to
the stock trading account he maintained for his business at the San
Francisco office of Bear, Stearns & Co., a brokerage house.
   Chinn maintained several trading accounts for clients at Bear,
Stearns, including the one for Meese.
   Independent counsel James C. McKay is investigating Meese,
chiefly because of his role in the pipeline affair. Key to this
aspect of the inquiry is a 1985 memo to Meese in which Wallach
cited a proposal to make payments to the Israeli Labor Party in
return for Israel's guarantee not to interfere with the pipeline to
be built by Iraq, its longtime enemy.

   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. said Thursday the Democratic
Party is bound for another election-year disaster if front-runner
Michael Dukakis wins its presidential nomination.
   ``We have tried a Mike Dukakis approach time and time and time
again and people of this country are just not buying it,'' Gore
said during a visit to Children's Memorial Hospital.
   ``The people want a president who understands it's necessary to
fight for working men and women, not a technocratic manager,'' the
Tennessean said.
   ``For those who want another election blowout and see the
Democratic Party losing 49 of 50 states, vote for Mike Dukakis.''
   In two days of campaigning for Illinois' March 15 primary, Gore
has portrayed the Massachusetts governor as too liberal for the
American electorate.
   He has mostly ignored the state's favorite sons _ Sen. Paul
Simon and Jesse Jackson _ except to acknowledge they have a
home-field advantage.
   Gore is staying at the Palmer House, one of the city's grand old
hotels, and he began his day a few yards away, shaking the hands of
rush-hour commuters as they left the elevated trains that circle
downtown.
   Later, he and his wife, Tipper, took a private tour of the
hospital on the city's North Side.
   In the lobby, the Gores met about a dozen young patients and
their parents who were surprised by the glare of the television
lights.
   ``Is this a nice place?'' Gore asked Sam Goad, 8.
   ``No,'' the boy replied. ``After a while it gets boring.''
   In remarks to hospital workers and patients, Gore said he would
overhaul federal Medicaid and Medicare programs and other health
services, preferably without a tax increase.
   ``I'm not proposing additional taxes,'' he said. ``I believe
that by changing priorities, eliminating wasteful spending in areas
that have been intentionally overlooked by the Reagan
administration ... it is possible to avoid a tax increase.
   ``I have indicated that it can't be completely ruled out.''
   Gore touted his 12 years in Congress, saying he sponsored
legislation to protect consumers of infant formulas and to make it
easier for children to get organ transplants.
   He planned to campaign in central Illinois on Friday before
moving on to South Carolina and Washington. Aides said he would
return to Illinois on Sunday.

   The nation's potential onshore oil discoveries
may be about 40 percent less than had been believed, according to
new studies by the U.S. Geological Survey.
   Using a new method of estimation, the survey concluded there is
a 50-50 chance that undiscovered crude oil totals 33.4 billion
barrels, well below the 54.6 billion estimated in a 1981 study,
according to figures provided to scientists at a research meeting
in Denver last week.
   Ozzie Girard, deputy assistant director for engineering geology,
said Thursday the major part of the change came from disappointing
drilling results.
   But some of the change results from a much lower price
prevailing over the last two years, when the latest work was done.
The 1981 work assumed a price of $30 a barrel, while the new study
assumes a price of $18.
   The Survey believes that the uncertainty of the estimates is
just as important as the estimates themselves. It said there is a
90 percent chance that undiscovered oil lies between 19.6 billion
barrels and 51.9 billion barrels. That range in 1981 was 41.7
billion barrels to 71 billion barrels.
   The estimates do not include known reserves, outlined by actual
drilling, or probable reserves believed to be findable in or
adjacent to a known field if new exploratory drilling were
undertaken. They also do not include oil and gas offshore.
   The Minerals Management Service, which is preparing new offshore
estimates, three years ago lowered its estimate of offshore oil
from 27 billion barrels to 12.2 billion.
   Participants at the Denver meeting also were advised that the
survey now estimates that reserves of undiscovered natural gas at
254 trillion cubic feet, down from the previous estimate of 427
trillion.
   The Potential Gas Committee, an industry group operated by the
Colorado School of Mines, said last year that in 1986 about 400
trillion cubic feet of gas remained to be discovered in the
categories corresponding to the Service estimates.
   Girard said the Service was not counting at least 100 trillion
cubic feet of gas in difficult-to-produce tight sands formations
that the committee includes. The Service also does not count gas in
certain shale formations that the committee counts.
   Neither body counts gas locked in coal seams, which the
committee termed ``enormous,'' perhaps 400 trillion to 800 trillion
cubic feet. Some of that gas is being produced commercially in
Alabama.
   The committee has gradually lowered its estimates of
undiscovered gas, including probable reserves and reserves
offshore, from about 900 trillion cubic feet in 1980 and 1982 to
765 trillion cubic feet in 1986.
   Industry reaction to the new estimates was mixed.
   ``We are very upset,'' said Terry Uhl of the American Gas
Association. People will not pay attention to the differing
classifications and it amounts to ``misinformation and
disinformation'' to say that undiscovered gas is only 254 trillion
cubic feet, Uhl said.
   Charles DiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute,
said he was unable to say what the numbers mean, and the institute
does not even keep track of such estimates. ``You never known until
you drill,'' he said.
   The figures issued in Denver were preliminary, Girard said, and
the Survey expects to issue detailed findings asking for public
comment sometime next month.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Chinese police patrolled the
Tibetan capital of Lhasa on foot and in trucks Thursday, and
foreigners there said hundreds of people have been arrested in the
past six days.
   The anniversary of the outbreak of a bloody 1959 Tibetan
uprising against Chinese rule passed Thursday without major
incident, said foreigners in Lhasa contacted by telephone from the
southwest China city of Chengdu.
   However, more than 100 trucks carrying armed police drove
through the main streets of the city of 150,000 in a show of force
and several dozen police with machine guns stood in front of the
city's holiest temple, the Jokhang, said Benjamin Watson, a tourist
from New York City.
   Watson, who speaks Tibetan, said an estimated 300 people had
been arrested since a clash Saturday between police and Tibetans
demanding independence.
   The official news agency Xinhua also said the situation in Lhasa
was normal Thursday. It said 100 top Tibetans gathered in Lhasa to
denounce the riots and ``those who conduct evil doings under the
guise of lama (monks).''
   Thousands of monks and lay Tibetans stoned police and lighted
bonfires in the city Saturday at the close of a major prayer
festival. It was the first major confrontation between Tibetans and
Chinese authorities since a series of protests in September and
October left at least 14 people dead.
   Chinese authorities have said two people _ a policeman and a
Tibetan _ died in Saturday's violence. Several foreign sources in
Lhasa initially estimated the deaths at eight. Watson said many
Tibetans maintain 24 people were killed, including 21 Tibetans and
three police.
   There was no way to confirm the figures.
   Several foreign travelers said they saw three monks being
arrested at Drepung monastery on the eastern fringe of the city,
bringing the total of Drepung monks reported under arrest to about
40.
   Chinese authorities have not allowed foreign reporters to enter
Lhasa this week.
   An ethnic Tibetan from Nepal, who reached Chengdu after
Saturday's clashes, said he believed up to 500 people were arrested.
   Several travelers said they had been allowed to enter the
1,300-year-old Jokhang Temple on Wednesday and Thursday and did not
see signs of fighting or damage. Police stormed the temple Saturday
and Tibetan monks told Westerners in Lhasa that 16 of their
colleagues had been killed there by police.
   Saturday's rioting began at the temple where monks had convened
on the final day of the 10-day annual ``moinlam qenmo'' prayer
festival. Monks shouted pro-independence and pro-Dalai Lama slogans
and threw rocks at police.
   March 10 is the 29th anniversary of a Tibetan revolt against
Chinese rule that resulted in the flight of the Dalai Lama,
spiritual leader of the Tibetans, and 100,000 followers, and a
bloody crackdown by the Chinese army.
   On that day in 1959, thousands of Tibetans surrounded the
Norbulinka, the Dalai Lama's summer palace in Lhasa, amid rumors
their god-king would be kidnapped by the Chinese army.
   On March 17, the Dalai Lama fled from the palace and led his
followers to exile in India. On March 20, the army attacked the
palace, and quashed the rebellion after three days of fighting.
   In New Delhi on Thursday, about 200 Tibetan refugees clashed
with police during a rally marking the anniversary of the abortive
uprising. Seven Tibetans and nine policemen were injured.
   In a statement from his home in exile in Dharamsala, northern
India, the Dalai Lama called on Tibetans to ``honor the courage of
our brethren in Tibet who have taken to the streets to draw
attention to their suffering under Chinese colonial rule.''
   China took control of Tibet in 1950 and claims the mountain
region has been part of Chinese territory for seven centuries. Many
Tibetans disagree, and hold deep antagonisms toward the Chinese
because of the Communist government's past suppression of Tibetan
language, customs and religion.

<HEAD>Administration Officials Say Clean-Up Legislation Unneeded</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Proposed legislation to ensure the federal
government complies with its own environmental laws is
unconstitutional, unneeded and could undercut efforts to clean up
such facilities as the Hanford nuclear reservation, Reagan
administration officials said Thursday.
   Members of a House subcommittee insisted, however, that the
Department of Energy and other agencies have ``thumbed their
noses'' at efforts by the Environmental Protection Agency to
enforce federal environmental laws at federal facilities.
   Lawmakers also said that EPA has been less than forceful in its
efforts to force compliance with the laws, while the Department of
Justice has obstructed those efforts.
   ``It's a shame that some in the federal government have taken
the position they are above the law,'' said Rep. Thomas Luken,
D-Ohio, chairman of the transportation, tourism and hazardous
materials subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
   The subcommittee's hearing focused on five bills that were
introduced late last year amid mounting criticism that the Energy
Department and other federal agencies are dragging their feet over
cleaning up federal facilities, including the Hanford reservation
in central Washington.
   The General Accounting Office has said there may be over 1,000
hazardous waste sites at Hanford, the legacy of 40 years of
plutonium production for nuclear weapons. The waste is both highly
radioactive and chemically toxic.
   ``The scope and the complexity precludes quick solutions,''
Joseph Salgado, a DOE undersecretary, said of the clean-up at
Hanford and other facilities.
   Salgado said that a compliance agreement with EPA and the state
of Washington covering clean-up of Hanford was a top priority of
DOE.
   But Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said after the hearing that DOE
promised almost a year ago to come up with an agreement and a plan
for Hanford.
   ``We still don't have a program, a schedule or anything,'' said
Wyden, adding that a new Justice Department interpretation of some
environmental laws might even preclude states from getting involved
in enforcement efforts.
   ``This is just another message that the administration isn't
serious about Hanford clean-up and is just throwing up more
obstacles,'' said Wyden.
   Wyden and Rep. Al Swift, D-Wash., are among the sponsors of the
package of bills that would establish a special environmental
counsel to enforce the laws, broaden the authority of the EPA and
the states in environmental matters at federal facilities and
create a special DOE department to handle environmental issues.
   Salgado said that the five proposed bills were unneeded and that
his department acknowledged their responsibility to comply with
federal environmental regulations.
   ``The Department of Energy's critical national security mission
must not be jeopardized by an environmental protection and safety
program too weak to assure excellence, or by one so rigid and
oppressive that these missions cannot be accomplished,'' he said.
   Salgado said DOE believes that the present framework of state
and federal laws are ``adequate and appropriate.''

<HEAD>Gallaudet Students Vow to Block New School President From Entering
Campus</HEAD>

   Gallaudet University students declared
Thursday that Elisabeth Ann Zinser, the new president of the school
for the deaf, is unwelcome on the campus and vowed to keep her out,
although a congressman wants her to learn firsthand about the
students' concerns.
   Students have been protesting the selection of Zinser, who is
not deaf and does not know sign language, and their demonstrations
have halted virtually all instruction for four days. They have
promised to continue their protests until she resigns.
   They threatened to seize the president's campus house and
office, if Zinser made her way past students blocking entrances to
the school.
   Zinser's whereabouts Thursday could not be determined.
University officials would not reveal at which hotel she was
staying.
   Student leader Greg Hlibok said students were willing to meet
with Zinser, but intend to tell her and Jane Bassett Spilman,
chairwoman of the school's board of trustees, that ``there will be
no dialogue, no compromise. That's what we're promising.''
   ``We want her out, and we intend to tell her she isn't welcome
here, that she's not our president,'' Hlibok added.
   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., who is a member of Gallaudet's board
of trustees, said in a statement Thursday he suggested to Zinser
that in the next few days she consult with the faculty, students,
staff and alumni ``to experience the passion with which they view
the appointment of hearing president.''
   ``The time is long overdue for Gallaudet University to have a
deaf president,'' Bonior said. ``The university has for generations
been an international mecca for excellence and opportunity in deaf
education.
   ``The question before us is _ How long will it be able to
sustain this important role without a deaf president?
   ``I hope Dr. Zinser and the board of trustees will be sensitive
to this urgent need as they begin to try to heal the wounds and
move forward to enhance the fine traditions of this institution.''
   Earlier, in an interview with The Washington Post, Bonior said
he told Zinser that federal aid for the school may be jeopardized
if she refuses to leave the post she was named to Sunday night.
   About 75 percent of the school's $76 million operating budget
comes from federal funds. The rest comes from tuition and grants.
   Zinser, who left an administrative position at the University of
North Carolina at Greensboro to take the Gallaudet job, said
Wednesday she was assuming her post immediately instead of waiting
until the original July starting date.
   She also lamented that campus protests have disrupted classes,
and said she would take unspecified steps to restore order if the
protests, which have been peaceful so far, took a violent turn.
   Besides calling for Zinser's ouster, the students want Spilman's
resignation, and a deaf majority on the 20-member trustees board,
which now has four deaf members.
   As Zinser attempted to start her job, support for the protesters
grew.
   Late Wednesday, Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson
issued a statement supporting the students, and called on
Gallaudet's board of trustees to ``resolve this dispute equitably.
   ``The problem is not that the students do not hear. The problem
is that the hearing world does not listen,'' Jackson said.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., another Democratic presidential
hopeful, on Thursday called for Zinser's resignation.
   Simon, a longtime member of the Senate Labor and Human Resources
subcommittee on the handicapped, which has jurisdiction over
funding for Gallaudet, said Zinser's appointment was a ``slap in
the face to the entire purpose of the university.''
   Vince Dollard, a spokesman for the National Technical Institute
for the Deaf, in Rochester, N.Y., said two buses and several cars,
carrying at least 100 students from the school, were to leave at
midnight for Washington to join the Gallaudet protest.
   A rally was being held on the Rochester campus in support of
Gallaudet Thursday afternoon.
   In addition, some East Coast leaders of the National Association
of the Deaf, a 20,000-member deaf rights group based in Silver
Spring, Md., will gather in Washington on Friday, spokesman Fred
Weiner said.
   And activist Abbie Hoffman, who lectures to universities on
student protests, said, ``What's happening at Gallaudet is
obviously right there in the front,'' he said, ``and they're going
to win their battle.''
   He said he has urged members of three electronic bulletin-board
networks, with a total of 16,000 members, to support the students'
efforts by tying up Gallaudet's switchboards with calls of support
for the students.

<HEAD>North Carolina and Tennessee Bury Hatchet Over Champion Paper Mill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL NOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A long and often acrimonious battle
between North Carolina and Tennessee over discharges from a
Champion International paper mill ended with approval of a
compromise, but environmentalists said their fight may not be over.
   The mill in Canton, N.C., produces raw paper stock for milk and
juice cartons and envelopes and discharges wastes into the Pigeon
River. Residents downstream in Tennessee had complained for years
that the wastes stained the Pigeon dark brown, killing game fish
and reducing the potential for recreational revenues.
   Tennessee officials agreed Wednesday to grant Champion a
variance on its water quality standards. The compromise will allow
the mill to continue operating by forcing it to cut its discharges
significantly.
   ``This has been hanging over our heads for about three years,''
Oliver Blackwell, manager of the mill.
   ``We still have a lot of work to do,'' he said, noting that it
could take months before a revised wastewater discharge permit can
be issued by the EPA. ``This is a big step but we recognize we
don't have the permit yet.''
   Environmentalists pledged to keep an eye on the plant. Nelson
Ross, one of the founders of the Dead Pigeon River Council in
Tennessee, called the agreement only an intermediate step toward
cleaning up the river.
   ``We're going to construct picnic areas, ramps for whitewater
enthusiasts,'' said Ross. ``We're going to develop some parks along
the shores of the Pigeon River and heaven help Champion if they
don't follow through and clean up the river like they've pledged to
do.''
   ``In accepting this revised permit, Champion has agreed to
operate under the most stringent environmental limits of any mill
in North America and possibly the world,'' said Blackwell. ``It's
going to be difficult but I'm encouraged.''
   The Canton plant employs about 2,300 people, with an annual
payroll of about $73 million. An additional 8,000 jobs depend on
Champion's purchases and contracts.
   The compromise drew praise from North Carolina Gov. Jim Martin
and Tennessee Gov. Ned McWherter, who have been directly involved
in the negotiations.
   ``This is the first agreement reached to clean up the Pigeon
River in the 80 years since the paper mill began operations,'' said
McWherter. ``It is a significant breakthrough in improving the
river's quality and allowing us to develop the area's economic
potential.''
   The two states weren't so complimentary in recent years.
   In 1983, Tennessee sued Champion and the North Carolina
Environmental Management Commission, contending the discharge made
the river unsuitable for fishing, swimming, boating or drinking.
   When North Carolina granted Champion a new permit in 1985 to
dump wastewater into the Pigeon, which begins south of Canton and
flows into Cocke County, Tenn., it placed no limit on the color of
the discharge. At Tennessee's urging, the Environmental Protection
Agency canceled the permit and took juristiction.
   The EPA's first proposed permit said the river could be no
darker than 50 color units _ about the color of ginger ale _ when
it reached the Tennessee border about 60 miles north of the paper
mill.
   Enviromentalists have said the color level in the river in Cocke
County ranged from 600 to 800 units.
   The proposed five-year permit, which must be approved by both
states, calls for a reduction in the color discharged from the mill
by 50 percent, with additional reductions when river levels are low.
   The compromise calls for Tennessee to grant Champion a variance
from the 50-unit standard. The revised permit allows about twice
that.
   Champion already has applied for a variance from North Carolina,
which must be approved before the wastewater permit is granted by
the EPA.
   Blackwell said the modernization of the plant and environmental
control equipment to comply with the new standards within the
required three-year time frame would cost the company about $100
million.

   The U.N. Human Rights Commission said Thursday
that Israel had violated human rights in southern Lebanon and
expressed concern about similar allegations in Iran and Afghanistan.
   The resolution ``strongly condemns Israel's persistence in
violating human rights manifested in acts of aggression,
bombardments of civilian populations, detentions and other
arbitrary practices.''
   The vote was 26-1, with 15 abstentions. The United States was
the lone dissenter.
   The resolution expresses grave concern at ``the continuation of
the acts of aggression and the arbitrary practices of the Israeli
occupation forces in southern Lebanon which constitute a flagrant
violation'' of international law.
   It calls upon Israel to stop such actions and urges Israel's
allies to pressure the government to end ``its aggressive and
expansionist policy in southern Lebanon.''
   The commission also adopted a resolution expressing ``deep
concern about the numerous and detailed allegations of grave human
rights violations'' in Iran. The vote was 20-4, with 15 abstentions.
   The resolution referred to a report by the commission's special
investigator, Salvadoran jurist Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, which cites
allegations of torture, arbitrary arrests, unfair trials and
religious persecution in Iran.
   It expresses ``deep concern'' at allegations that torture and
maltreatment ``are common in Iranian prisons during interrogation
and before and after the final verdict.''
   The resolution urges Iran to answer Galindo's requests for
information and to allow him to visit the country, which it has
refused to do so far.
   The vote on the Afghanistan resolution was 29-7 with six
abstentions. The Soviet Union, Byelorussia, East Germany, Bulgaria,
Ethiopia, Nicaragua and India voted against the measure.
   Soviet chief delegate Viladimir Lomeiko said it was unbalanced
and ``permeated with the spirit of confrontation'' at a time
significant progress was made in U.N.-mediated efforts to secure
peace in Afghanistan.

<TEXT>
   Vandals protesting alleged elitism at
Brown University damaged 10 oil portraits of early school
supporters.
   ``It appears to be a protest against the white elitist male
orientation of the founders of the university,'' Eric Broudy,
spokesman for the school, said Wednesday.
   The vandals spray-painted the message ``Elite? Who us?'' across
the paintings in the Manning Chapel, Broudy said.
   A group calling itself ``the Coalition for Creative Subversion''
claimed responsibility and called on the school to ``diversify
itself,'' Broudy said.
   The vandalism occurred Feb. 17, one day before a seminar on
class and elitism was held in the room, said Eric Widmer, the dean
of student life.
   Widmer said it will cost more than $15,000 to restore the
portraits, which are more than a century old. ``I don't know that a
value could be placed on the paintings, but they're certainly part
of the history of Brown,'' he said.
   The group's letter, sent to the campus newspaper and distributed
around campus, contended that incidents from Brown's history show
that the school is racist, sexist and biased against certain
religions.
   ``Another way Brown perpetuates these discourses is by choosing
to hang paintings of wealthy white men on its walls,'' the
statement said.

<HEAD>Nebraska's Kerrey, Vermont's Sanders Declare Candidacies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Nebraska Gov. Bob Kerrey officially entered the race for
the U.S. Senate on Thursday, while maverick Mayor Bernard Sanders
launched his campaign for Vermont's sole congressional seat.
   ``I would like to be your next senator,'' Kerrey, a 44-year-old
Democrat, told 300 supporters in Omaha before starting a two-day
swing through the state.
   No other Democrat has declared for the nomination. Sen. David
Karnes, appointed to fill the term of the late Edward Zorinsky, and
Rep. Haul Daub are seeking the GOP nomination.
   ``I can promise you I will never betray you. And I will never
dishonor the respect I have for you,'' said Kerrey.
   Despite high popularity ratings, Kerrey declined to run for
re-election as governor in 1986 because he said it was ``time to
move on.''
   Kerrey ended months of speculation last November when he said he
would run for the Senate. Since then he has been criss-crossing the
state, saying his main issues are trade policy, the federal budget,
education and agriculture.
   ``A great and glorious future will not happen unless we do the
unglamorous work today,'' he said Thursday.
   Sanders, four-term mayor of Burlington, Vermont's largest city,
and a longtime critic of the concentration of wealth in America,
said he would fight for national health care, disarmament, tough
environmental laws, affordable day care and higher taxes on the
wealthy and corporations.
   Although Sanders, 46, has long claimed socialist leanings, he
said he would run as an independent candidate.
   Four Democrats and one Republican have declared their intentions
to run for the seat being vacated by Republican James Jeffords, who
in turn is seeking to fill the seat of retiring Republican Sen.
Robert Stafford.
   Sanders said Thursday he wanted to take his
tax-the-rich-and-feed-the-poor message to Washington.
   ``If a hotshot student can graduate law school and start work at
$70,000 a year for a big-name law firm, surely we can pay child
care workers more than $12,000 a year and teachers more than
$16,000 a year, and nursing home workers more than the minimum
wage,'' Sanders said in Montpelier, the state's capital.

<TEXT>
   The state's highest court on Thursday rejected
claims of an unfair trial and left standing the convictions of four
men in the 1983 gang rape of a woman on a tavern pool table.
   In a pair of unanimous rulings, the Massachusetts Supreme Court
rejected defense objections to the prosecutor's handling of
evidence, to the trial judge's decision to keep television cameras
turned away from the victim and to other matters.
   Bristol County District Attorney Ronald Pina welcomed the
ruling, saying he hoped it would end the lingering controversy over
the case and encourage women everywhere to prosecute rapes.
   Defense attorney David H. Waxler said he was reviewing the
opinion for possible grounds for further appeal.
   ``The unfortunate aspect of this sort of decision is that future
prosecutors rest more comfortbaly in the knowledge that they need
not turn over exculpatory evidence, and that's unfortunate,'' he
said. ``It's the old saying: tough cases make bad law.''
   The dramatic account of the rape given by the victim, a young
mother, and the lengthy televised trial in Superior Court in 1984
drew unwanted national attention to the working-class neighborhoods
of New Bedford and sparked an intense debate over rape. It also
brought agony to the Portuguese-American community in the fishing
city 60 miles south of Boston.
   Six young men of Portugese descent were charged in the case;
four were convicted of aggravated rape.
   Daniel Silvia was sentenced to nine to 12 years; Joseph Vieira,
six to eight years; and John Cordeiro and Victor Raposo, nine to 12
years each.
   The victim, also of Portuguese ancestry, left New Bedford and
was killed in a single-car crash outside Miami in 1986 at age 25.
   According to court records, the woman entered Big Dan's tavern
on March 6, 1983, to buy cigarettes. She ordered a drink and spoke
briefly with another woman, and they watched a game of pool. When
she declined an offer of a ride from Cordeiro and Raposo, the court
said, she was knocked down, dragged to thje pool table and raped,
the judges said.
   ``Eventually, clothed only in a shirt and one shoe, the victim
escaped and ran into the street, where she flagged down a passing
truck.''
   On appeal, Vieira and Silvia claimed the prosecutor failed to
make a timely disclosure of certain evidence that might have helped
the defense, depriving them of their rights to due process. They
also argued that the district attorney suppressed until after trial
a witness's recorded account of the victim's condition and
statements shortly after the rape.
   And they argued that Young prejudiced the defense theory that
the victim consented to the sex. They also complained about the
exclusion of an allegedly false prior complaint of rape by the
woman.
   In their separate appeal, Cordeiro and Raposo argued that
Young's order keeping courtroom cameras away from the woman
prejudiced their right to a fair trial. They also claimed that
Young erred in refusing to instruct the jury on consensual rape.
   The high court dismissed each claim.

<HEAD>Angolan Official Says Luanda Against Any Role For Savimbi</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Angolan official said Thursday his
government would never agree to giving rebel leader Jonas Savimbi a
role in running the country if an end to the civil war is
successfully negotiated.
   Manuel Pedro Pacavira, Angola's new ambassador to the United
Nations, indicated that Savimbi would have to leave before there
could be any reconciliation between officials of his Marxist
government and UNITA, Savimbi's organization.
   ``Some elements of UNITA could deserve different treatment ...
but not Savimbi,'' Pacavira told reporters at a luncheon. ``He is a
crook, incoherent ... doesn't care about consequences.''
   Savimbi's group _ the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola, or UNITA _ receives financial aid from the United States
and South Africa.
   Before peace is achieved, Pacavira said, South Africa must cease
its help to UNITA and there must be an ``understanding'' that the
United States will end its assistance.
   A major stumbling block to ending the 12-year civil war is the
presence of 40,000 Cuban troops in Angola. State Department
officials say the Angolans have agreed in principle to withdrawal
of the troops.
   Pacavira said Angola is prepared to remove the troops ``within
limits'' once outside aid to UNITA stops and South Africa grants
independence to Namibia under a United Nations plan.
   The Angolans have not provided a timetable for any troop
withdrawal, but Pacavira said he expects another ``ministerial
meeting'' between officials of Luanda and Washington in March or
April.
   Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker, who has tried for
seven years to negotiate a solution in Angola, held discussions
with Angolans in January. The State Department said it is awaiting
new proposals from Angola.
   Pacavira said the United States can continue to play a role as
mediator, but Angola is also ready to hold discussions with
officials of white-ruled South Africa. The Cubans would have to be
included in the talks, he said.
   Pacavira dismissed a statement made by South African Defense
Minister Magnus Malan who suggested that Pretoria is willing to
deal directly with the Soviet Union on Angola.
   ``His statement has nothing concrete and constructive,''
Pacavira said. ``It is just an exercise to distract public
opinion.''
   Pacavira served as his country's ambassador to Cuba before being
assigned to the United Nations.

<HEAD>Bush: `Tired' of Scandal in High Office</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Bush saying not criticizing Reagan, subbing 5
grafs for grafs 7-8 pvs, Bush did ... of ethics.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush said Thursday he is ``tired of being
embarrassed'' by scandals surrounding public officials and
unethical behavior by high government officials. He pledged he
would create a special White House ethics panel if elected
president.
   Bush, arriving in Illinois on the heels of his stunning Super
Tuesday victory, also promised he would set up a budget deficit
summit with congressional leaders on ``day one'' of his
administration _ an echo of a stand taken by GOP presidential rival
Bob Dole.
   Bush told the Governor's Club luncheon at the Chicago Hilton
said that in such a summit scenario, ``I am personally going to
head the executive branch negotiating effort.''
   ``We're going to meet. We're going to talk. Maybe, even, we'll
shout, but we're going to solve this problem,'' he said.
   Bush has said on several occasions that he would seek to bring
people into government ``who want to serve, not to profit'' but he
has steadfastly refused to criticize any Reagan administration
officials, including Attorney General Edwin Meese, who is under
investigation by several grand juries.
   Former top White House aides Michael K. Deaver and Lyn Nofziger
have been convicted in court cases involving their lobbying
activities after leaving the administration.
   At a news conference shortly after his speech, Bush was asked
whether his call for a special White House panel on ethics was a
criticism of the way things had been done during the Reagan
administration.
   ``No, because I was asked this in an interview ... and I said I
don't know of anybody who has a higher standard of personal ethics
than the president, always above any possible conflict of
interest,'' he replied. ``Certainly, nobody should imply criticism.
I'm just saying what my priorities would be in the future.''
   Asked to name public officials who had caused him embarrassment,
Bush said, ``I'm not going to be specific in terms of names. I'm
going to be generic.''
   Bush said, ``I'm just saying how I would do it.''
   He said in his speech, ``I am personally disturbed at the
breaches of ethics I have seen in the past few years in government.
Once elected, I'd appoint an ethics panel to work right there in
the White House. I'd have them draft a new and specific code of
ethics.''
   ``When a congressman goes bad or someone in the executive branch
violates the public trust, it hurts,'' he said. ``I'm tired of
being embarrassed. I'm tired of seeing our children seeing things
that should embarrass us all. People at all levels of government
should come to serve, not to profit.''
   ``Clearly, I have big plans,'' he told the audience of
Republican boosters, who sat silently through the speech.
   At the outset of his talk, Bush told his audience ``there's no
complacency'' in his campaign in the wake of his near sweep of the
Super Tuesday competition.
   Bush's announcement that he would personally oversee
deficit-reduction negotiations also seemed an implied criticism of
Reagan.
   In the aftermath of the Wall Street crash last Oct. 19, Reagan
set up a negotiating team to work out a deficit-reduction
compromise with Capitol Hill leaders.
   But with the exception of some meetings in the White House with
congressional figures, Reagan left the actual bargaining to chief
of staff Howard Baker, Treasury Secretary James Baker and budget
director James Miller.
   Those negotiations produced a two-year, $76 billion budget
reduction plan, which included $23 billion in new taxes.
   Bush, from the start of the campaign, has said that he would not
try to win the GOP nomination by ``jumping away'' from Reagan or by
criticizing the president.
   ``I'm not going to try to move up the ladder by knocking someone
else down,'' the vice president has said.
   And in Thursday's speech, there was plenty of praise for the
president.
   ``I am proud to have been part of a m ajor change in public
policy,'' he said. ``They call it the Reagan revolution because it
was revolutionary. ... You know the results. Greatest peacetime
economic growth in our history, strengthened defense, the Soviets
come to the bargaining table.
   ``But it's not a complete triumph. It's only a beginning,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Youth Arrested After Prostitution `Bust'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police arrested a 17-year-old who allegedly
donned a sheriff-style uniform and posed as a lawman in order to
have sex with a professional escort.
   The youth was arrested on charges of impersonating a public
officer and released on $3,000 bond, authorities said Thursday.
   Austin vice investigator Earl Hall said the youth entered a
motel Feb. 24 wearing a brown uniform, a heavy police-type jacket
and a gun belt with .38-caliber snub-nose pistol.
   The youth identified himself as a member of the Sheriff's
Department of Williamson County, working on a prostitution case,
Hall said. The man called an Austin escort service and then asked
for a room in which to make an arrest, he said.
   When the escort arrived at the room, the youth told her she was
under arrest for prostitution but implied he would let her go if
she had sex with him, Hall said. They left the motel after the
manager came to the room and asked the youth to pay for it, he said.
   The youth was then refused rooms at two other motels, Hall said.
   At a fourth motel, the youth said he was an Austin police
officer, paid for a room and had sexual intercourse with the
escort, Hall said. He then released her, saying no charges would be
filed, he said.
   The woman then got her boyfriend, who confronted the
impersonator at a gas station and took his gun belt and briefcase
in an effort to learn his identity, Hall said.
   The youth reported a robbery to police. They arrested the woman
and her boyfriend that day but released them.
   The youth was arrested the same day when he allegedly tried to
reclaim his property at the police station. He was released pending
further investigation, then rearrested Wednesday on the
impersonation charge.

<HEAD>Moscow Purchases Additional 100,000 Tons Of US Corn</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
100,000 metric tons of U.S. corn for delivery this year under a
long-term supply agreement between the two countries, the
Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 100,000 tons of
corn would be about 3.94 million bushels.
   Corn prices recently have been averaging about $1.84 per bushel
at the farm level, meaning that the sale could have a farm value of
around $7.25 million.
   Officials said the latest sale involved 50,000 tons that had
been reported by exporters as headed for Japan, and 50,000 tons for
``unknown destinations.''
   The corn is part of the grain the Soviet Union is committed to
buy during the fifth and final year of the agreement, which calls
for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of U.S. grain.
The pact expires Sept. 30.
   According to the agreement, the annual purchases are supposed to
include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The
Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as
wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two
tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.
   With the latest purchases, the Soviets now have bought 3.27
million tons of corn, plus more than .9 million tons of wheat;
813,300 tons of soybeans, and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal.

<HEAD>Veto Threatened of Bill Requiring Covert Action Notice Within 48

   President Reagan would veto any bill requiring
him to tell Congress about all covert actions within 48 hours after
they start, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said Thursday.
   Carlucci, who was national security adviser before being named
to the defense post last November, made the statement as a House
Intelligence subcommittee continued hearings on a bill overhauling
the procedure for White House cooperation with Capitol Hill on
intelligence matters.
   Administration officials had suggested previously that a
presidential veto of such legislation was likely, but Carlucci's
statement marked the first time a top administration official had
flatly promised a veto.
   The House bill and a similar piece of legislation in the Senate
were a response to the Iran-Contra affair, in which U.S. arms were
secretly sold to Iran and some of the profits diverted to the
Contra rebels in Nicaragua. Final action on the Senate bill is
likely next week when the Democratic-controlled chamber returns
from a one-week vacation.
   In the case of the Iran-Contra affair, Reagan withheld
notification from Congress about the sale of arms to Iran for 10
months in 1986. But he has promised to tell Congress about all
future covert operations.
   ``At some point, we have to rely on trust,'' Carlucci told the
subcommittee. He noted that ``if a future president sets out to
deceive a Congress, no amount of statutes will stop him.''
   Carlucci said that either the Senate or House bill ``surely
will'' be vetoed by Reagan.
   Current laws require that Congress be notified of all covert
operations, except under extraordinary circumstances. In those
latter cases, the law only requires ``timely notice'' but it does
not define that phrase. The pending bills would spell out that
notice must be sent to Capitol Hill within 48 hours after a covert
action starts.
   Reagan believes the bills are an unconstitutional limit on his
authority, Carlucci said.
   ``I can think of no step by the Congress which would do more
harm to the process of rebuilding an atmosphere of trust and candor
between the branches than unilaterally to lay claim to prerogatives
which the president firmly believes are vested in the executive by
the Constitution,'' he said.
   Rep. Matt McHugh, D-N.Y., chairman of the Intelligence
subcommittee, supported the bill and noted that ``in the case of
the arms sales to Iran, the president construed current law as
permitting him to withhold notice for more than 10 months after the
covert sales had been authorized.''
   ``If he had done so (as the law generally requires),'' McHugh
said, ``he would surely have heard some strong objections and might
have spared the country a serious foreign policy setback and
himself a major political embarrassment.''
   But Carlucci argued that ``the failures of the Iran affair were
human and managerial. No statue can prevent these mistakes.''
   ``We will not put the mistrust which caused the Iran-Contra
affair behind us until we trust each other again,'' Carlucci said.
   Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser to President Ford and
a member of the Tower commission that investigated the Iran-Contra
affair, testified that ``the excessively restrictive language
proposed seems a case of throwing out the baby with the bath. It is
not possible to eliminate every opportunity for abuse by the
executive without at the same time paralyzing the ability to act.''
   He said the legislation arises from the belief that Congress
would have opposed the arms sales and derailed them if it had been
notified.
   But ``there is no evidence to support this assumption,''
Scowcroft said. ``Indeed, as it was, the president was confronted,
by his principal advisors, with views strongly in opposition to the
Iranian arms sales.''

   Jack Kemp ended his Republican presidential
campaign Thursday, saying George Bush has won ``the Reagan wing of
the Republican Party'' and hinting that he'd welcome the No. 2 spot
on the ticket.
   Kemp, whose campaign as the true conservative heir to Ronald
Reagan never caught on with voters, endorsed no candidate. He said
of his rivals, ``They're all Reagan conservatives.''
   The New York congressman bowed out at a Capitol Hill news
conference, flanked by his family and some of the House members who
backed his candidacy. He evoked cheers from moist-eyed supporters
with a vow that ``No way'' would this be his last campaign for the
White House.
   Kemp, 51, said he would not seek re-election to the House seat
from Buffalo that he has held for 18 years. He did not rule out
running for the Senate from New York but said he had no plans to do
so.
   He called the notion that he might be asked to be the Republican
vice presidential candidate a ``very flattering and awesome
thought.''
   He said he didn't expect it but added, ``Would I think about it?
The answer to that is yes.''
   Kemp entered the presidential race in April 1987 after years of
preparation to position himself as the candidate of the Republican
right wing.
   But his campaign never caught on with Republican voters, and he
consistently finished behind Bush, Bob Dole and former television
evangelist Pat Robertson in the GOP primaries.
   Less than three weeks ago in a debate with his rivals, Kemp
declared that the nomination of Bush or Dole would signal the death
of the ``Reagan revolution'' of conservatism. But in withdrawing,
Kemp said that Bush had won Reagan's Republican constituency.
   ``We were competing for the Reagan wing of the Republican Party,
and he won,'' Kemp said.
   ``It's very clear that George Bush ran on the Reagan agenda. And
I think that the vote for George Bush, with all due respect, today
is a vote'' for Ronald Reagan, Kemp said.
   ``It's simply to recognize that I was running against Ronald
Reagan. And that's a surprise because I am his strongest proponent,
at least in terms of the ideals that were launched back in 1980.''
   Kemp spoke by telephone with Bush and the other GOP candidates
Wednesday night. Bush chief of staff Craig Fuller, with the vice
president, said Bush's ``respect for the congressman has grown over
the course of the campaign.''
   Kemp never was able to coalesce around his candidacy even the
conservative movement within the Republican Party that he claimed
to lead.
   Some conservative leaders said that while they would like to see
Kemp on the ticket, they doubted he had displayed enough political
drawing power to be asked to join it.
   Robertson said, ``With Jack Kemp's withdrawal today, I am more
and more being urged by conservatives to stay in the race as a
rallying point for conservatives and conservative principles.''
   ``Portions of the 3 or 4 percent he's been getting should come
over to me,'' Robertson said.
   Kemp's best showing in the primaries was 13 percent of the vote
in New Hampshire. On Tuesday in 17 GOP contests, the best he scored
was a dismal 7 percent in Massachusetts.
   Kemp won just four delegates from 712 at stake in Super Tuesday
contests. Kemp had 35 committed delegates _ but most of those were
handed to him by Bush in a Michigan compromise designed to prevent
Robertson from claiming a victory.
   Daniel L. Casey, executive director of the American Conservative
Union, said that with Kemp gone from the race, many conservative
Republicans could be expected to focus their efforts on trying to
shape the Republican Party platform. Beyond that, he said, they may
push for a conservative running mate and turn attention to
congressional and other local races.
   ``It remains to be seen whether or not the leadership in
Washington of the conservative movement will establish a working
relationship with the Bush campaign,'' said Casey.
   Campaign spokesman John Buckley said Kemp spent $15 million on
his effort, and departs with debts of less than $100,000.
   ``We balanced our budget,'' Kemp said.

<HEAD>Simon Looks To Home State to Regain Matching Fund Status</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Paul Simon is counting on a strong
showing in his home state of Illinois next Tuesday to restore his
eligibility for federal matching funds before a cutoff is
triggered, a campaign spokesman said Thursday.
   Simon became ineligible for matching funds by winning less than
10 percent of the vote in two successive primaries, but election
law stays the cutoff for 30 days.
   The matching funds can continue to flow during the 30 days, and
eligibility is restored when a candidate receives at least 20
percent of the vote in another state primary.
   ``We are not in jeopardy,'' said Simon's press secretary Terry
Michael. ``There is zero chance that we won't get 20 percent next
Tuesday.'' In fact, he said, Simon is counting on cleaning up in
all but three of the state's 22 congressional districts.
   Michael conceded those three Chicago districts to the state's
other native son, Jesse Jackson, who expects he will win much more
than that.
   Federal Election Commission spokesman Fred Eiland said that
after Simon fell below the 10 percent threshhold in South Dakota
and Vermont, he would have had to get 20 percent in one of the
Super Tuesday states this week.
   Since he did not campaign for Super Tuesday and failed to do
achieive the threshhold, his ineligibility for matching funds will
be effective March 31 unless he does well in Illinois, Eiland said.
   Rep. Jack Kemp, R-New York, also has fallen below the threshhold
but since he dropped out of the race on Thursday, he will be
allowed to receive matching funds to pay off any leftover debts.
However, he could not use those funds to resume campaigning.
   The same is true of former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart, if he drops
out of the race Friday as aides have said he would do.
   The matching funds are provided from the taxypayer-supported
fund. Every donation of $250 or less that a candidate raises is
matched by the public fund. To qualify, a candidate must raise at
least $100,000 across 20 states in contributions of $250 or less.
   Michael said Simon has whittled down his loan debt, which stood
at more than $500,000 at the beginning of February, to about
$45,000, and has some $100,000 in cash on hand.
   The campaign raised $932,000 during February through events and
direct mail and got $364,000 in matching funds.
   Simon has received a total $2.2 million in matching funds so far.

<HEAD>Town Tries to Forget One Year After Four Teen Suicides</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   One year has passed since four
teen-agers made a suicide pact and died together in a locked garage
here, but local officials say the worst thing they could do is
commemorate the deaths.
   ``All psychiatrists tell us don't memorialize it in any way,''
said school Superintendent John Habeeb. ``It could only cause
trauma. It will be business as usual on Friday.''
   Last March 11, Thomas Olton, 19, Thomas Rizzo, 18, and sisters
Cheryl and Lisa Burress, ages 17 and 16, were found dead of carbon
monoxide poisoning in Olton's idling car.
   Reporters descended upon the school and officials worried that
other troubled youths seeking glorification might try to imitate
the four.
   ``Our fear was that the blitz could trigger some students that
were already unstable,'' Habeeb said. ``After all, it's very
romantic to get your name in the paper.''
   Charlotte P. Ross, president and executive director of the Youth
Suicide National Center in Washington, D.C., said studies in the
past year tend to discount any ``copycat'' theory of adolescent
suicides.
   ``There's an enormous amount of suicidal behavior among young
people,'' Ms. Ross said. ``Since Bergenfield, studies have cast
shadows and a lot of doubt that suicide is like the measles. You
can't catch it.''
   Even so, Bergenfield has worked hard to avoid any repeat of the
tragedy.
   In the past year, Bergenfield High School has given a part-time
drug and alcohol counselor full-time status _ authorities found
traces of cocaine in the blood of all four of the dead youngsters,
and two had been drinking.
   The school also hired a psychiatrist for grades 7-12, and hired
two outreach workers for its community response team. The response
team, comprised of mental health professionals, clergy, teachers
and police officers, began immediately after the suicides.
   ``It's an example of an outstanding response,'' Ms. Ross said.
``They've worked very hard. We don't know how many suicides came
close and were prevented.''
   Bergenfield's strategy will be part of a manual on adolescent
suicide due for release in the spring by the federal Centers for
Disease Control and will play a part in guidelines being assembled
in California for municipalities there, she said.
   Bergenfield has done such a good job that the federal government
denied two grant applications for the community, saying other
municipalities needed the money more, Habeeb said.
   He said the school's programs have cost about $80,000, and New
Jersey has sent a $35,000 state grant for substance abuse programs
in town.
   Robert J. Gallione Jr., the recently elected mayor of this
community of 26,000 residents and a job counselor at Columbia
University, says the money is well spent.
   The focus of the past year has been on reaching out to youths
and identifying teen-agers who feel alienated. Special attention is
paid to dropouts, since three of the four suicide victims had left
school.
   Habeeb said Bergenfield's low drop-out rate of 1.5 percent can
lead to dropouts being stigmatized.
   Gallione added that a Mayor's Advisory Committee on Youth gives
teen-agers a chance to suggest ideas that might not naturally occur
to adults.
   One recent suggestion was a town-sponsored battle of teen rock
bands. Gallione called that a good approach to disaffected youths,
who often find a safe haven in music.
   While school officials work on prevention, others in town want
to forget.
   Four 15-year-old sophomore girls, who didn't want to give a
reporter their names, said the suicides are not talked about much
anymore.
   The mayor said such an attitude is not a bad thing.
   ``There was a lot of negative focus but it's been offest by
other things we do in the community,'' Gallione said. ``People have
to come to see another side of us _ just a traditional community.''

<HEAD>House Committee Approves Increase In Minimum Wage To $5.05 Over 4
Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An increase in the federal minimum wage from
$3.35 to $5.05 an hour was tentatively approved Thursday by the
House Education and Labor Committee.
   The original bill before the committee called for an increase of
50 cents in 1989, 40 cents in 1990 and 40 cents in 1991 to $4.65.
   The committee adopted, on a vote of 18-14, an amendment by Rep.
Carl C. Perkins, D-Ky., which added a 40-cent increase in the
fourth year, on Dec. 31, 1991.
   The full committee was unable to take action on all the pending
amendments and will continue debate on the bill next week.
   The Senate has a companion bill, sponsored by Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, which
would raise the minimum wage to $4.65 over a three-year period.
   The Perkins amendment was approved essentially along party lines
except that two Democrats, Reps. Austin J. Murphy of Pennsylvania
and Timothy J. Penny of Minnesota, joined the Republicans in
opposing the proposal.
   Murphy is chairman of the House labor standards subcommittee,
which had approved an increase to $4.65. He said that legislation
was ``crafted so that it will be accepted by the full House and the
executive branch. If we accept this (Perkins) proposal, it will not
be accepted.''
   Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., read from a letter written by
Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin, who said senior White House
advisers would recommend to President Reagan that he veto any
legislation increasing the minimum wage.
   ``So it doesn't matter what we do, the executive will be against
it,'' Solarz said.
   The House committee also voted 20-13 on an amendment by Rep.
Tommy F. Robinson, D-Ark., to increase the ``tip credit'' for
restaurant workers.
   Current law allows employers of workers who regularly receive
tips _ such as waiters and waitresses _ to count the tips as earned
wages equivalent to 40 percent of the minimum wage. Thus, a
restaurant owner could pay a worker $2.01 an hour, with the
remaining $1.34 - 40 percent of today's $3.35-an-hour minimum wage
_ coming from tips.
   Under the Robinson amendment, the tip minimum would be raised to
50 percent of the minimum. Thus, if the minimum wage were increased
to $5.05 an hour, an employer could pay a $2.52 hourly wage, with
the other $2.52 coming from tips.
   The biggest argument of the session came over the amendment by
Perkins who said his proposal ``does not go far enough, but it is a
start.''
   ``It gives the American worker some level of decency,'' Perkins
said.
   He said his amendment would still not bring workers up to what
is described by the federal government as the ``poverty level,'' a
family of three earning approximately $9,500.
   Rep. Dick Armey, R-Tex., who opposes any increase in the minimum
wage because he said he would destroy jobs, proposed an amendment
to raise the base to $20 an hour.
   ``I don't think we ought to be pikers,'' he said. ``It would put
minimum wage workers on the par with members of Congress.''
   Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif., the committee chairman,
called the proposal ``absurd.'' Armey said he thought the entire
discussion was absurd because the committee refused to discuss the
number of jobs that would be lost because of the minimum wage
increase.
   Armey, an economist, said different studies show anywhere from
300,000 to 800,000 job opportunities would be lost because of the
increase. Hawkins said there was not support for such projections.

<TEXT>
   The former leader of a white supremacist
group testified Thursday that the founder of the right-wing group
The Order gave him $75,000 in stolen money in 1984 to fund his
organization.
   Glenn Miller, 47, former leader of the White Patriots Party in
North Carolina, said Robert Mathews, killed in a shootout with the
FBI near Seattle in December 1984, gave him the money on a visit in
August 1984.
   ``He explained that it was stolen from banks and armored cars,''
Miller said.
   Miller said Mathews told him that his group was ``sitting on
$3.5 million. He said that they were working on an inside job that
would net them $50 million.''
   Zillah Craig, Mathews' girlfriend, testified Wednesday that she
traveled around the country with Mathews and helped him distribute
$2 million, part of $3.6 million stolen from an armored car in June
1984 at Ukiah, Calif.
   Both Miller and Ms. Craig testified in the sedition trial of 14
men. Ten defendants are charged with sedition, five are charged
with conspiring to kill a federal judge and an FBI agent, and two
are charged with interstate transportation of stolen money.
   Miller said Robert Miles, one of the 14 defendants, once told
him that he could receive more money for his organization.
   Miller said Mathews told him several leaders of the white
supremacist movement had received money, among them defendant Louis
Ray Beam. Miller said Mathews also claimed to have given money to
William Pierce, head of a reputed white supremacist group called
the National Alliance.
   Pierce also wrote a book of fiction called ``The Turner
Diaries,'' which government witnesses have testified formed the
basis for The Order's plan to overthrow the government and
establish an all-white nation in the Northwest.
   Miller, who was captured at Ozark, Mo., by the FBI, has pleaded
guilty to a firearms charge and sending a threat through the mail.

   The Soviet Union said Thursday it feels free to
keep sending military aid to the Kabul government even after it
withdraws its troops from Afghanistan.
   It rejected a U.S. demand that foreign military aid to both
sides in the Afghanistan war cease simultaneously once a peace
settlement is reached. The United States aids the Afghan rebels.
   Nikolay Kozyrev, a senior Soviet specialist in Asian affairs,
said that except for sending new troops to Afghanistan, the Soviet
Union was not committed to halt any kind of assistance to Kabul. He
noted that the two countries had contractual ties now for seven
decades.
   Kozyrev, introduced as an ambassador-at-large, came to Geneva as
head of a small Soviet delegation assigned to follow the indirect
peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan. U.N. Undersecretary
General Diego Cordovez is mediating the talks.
   Kozyrev's appearance at a news conference organized by the
Soviet mission to the U.N. office in Geneva marked the first time a
Soviet official took a public stand on the negotiations since the
talks started almost six years ago.
   He said the question of a cutoff of Soviet aid never was a
subject of the U.N.-sponsored peace talks. He termed the U.S.
demand for a ``symmetrical cessation'' of military aid, spelled out
at a State Department briefing last Friday, ``an attempt to
interfere with the internal affairs of Afghanistan and with the
bilateral relationship'' between Kabul and Moscow.
   Kozyrev said the U.S. demand would be tantamount to Moscow
calling for a cut-off of U.S. military aid to Pakistan.
   A U.S. mission spokesman, Chris Henze, said there would be no
immediate comment from Robert Peck, the assistant deputy secretary
of state who is in Geneva to follow the talks. Kozyrev said he was
in touch with Peck.
   The chief Afghan negotiator, Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil, said
last week draft documents of the settlement provided for U.S. aid
to the Islamic guerrillas to cease simultaneously with the start of
the withdrawal of the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops.
   The United States is the main supplier of arms to the guerrillas
fighting the Marxist Kabul government, with shipments reported
worth about $700 million last year and including shoulder-fired
Stinger missiles.
   Kozyrev told reporters that after agreement was reached on all
main elements of the projected peace package, negotiations bogged
down because of Pakistan's insistence on the settlement's being
accompanied by formation of a broad-based transitional government
in Kabul.
   Pakistan argues that only such a government, replacing the
Soviet-backed one headed by President Najib, would be able to
oversee implementation of the agreements and ensure a safe return
of more than 5 million refugees from Pakistan and Iran.
   Kozyrev sidestepped a question on whether negotiations could
continue after next Tuesday's target date set by Moscow. Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has said Moscow will bring home its
troops starting May 15 provided the settlement is signed by March
15.
   Pakistan, which adjoins Afghanistan, supports the guerrillas and
acts as their spokesman at the Geneva talks.
   Cordovez met separately with the two delegations Thursday for a
total of five hours. He said there would be no formal negotiation
session Friday, but he would meet privately with the two sides.
   Cordovez said earlier that final agreement was not imminent.
   Also on Thursday, the 43-nation U.N. Human Rights Commission
adopted by a 29-7 vote a Western-sponsored resolution expressing
concern at what it said were continued widespread violations of
human rights by Afghan authorities, despite some improvement. Six
nations abstained and Mozambique was absent.
   The Soviet Union intervened militarily in neighboring
Afghanistan in late 1979 and its troops stayed on to fight
anti-Marxist guerrillas.

   NASA officials warned Congress on Thursday
that the space station program would be destroyed if money is
diverted to build an unmanned scientific and manufacturing facility
in space.
   At the same time, the space station budget came under attack
elsewhere in the Capitol, when Rep. Edward P. Boland, D-Mass.,
pressed for more money for housing programs next year and said if
that money is not allocated, then Congress will ``kiss goodbye to
the space station.''
   Boland, whose House Appropriations subcommittee handles funding
for housing programs as well as independent agencies including the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said his panel would
take money for housing from the budgets for NASA and the National
Science Foundation unless Congress changes the overall budget
priorities.

   A pact allowing Japan to retrieve plutonium
from U.S. nuclear wastes would leave the United States without
``effective control'' over reprocessing of the hazardous material,
the General Accounting Office has concluded.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, also found fault
with the agreement's provisions to guard against proliferation of
plutonium, the principal element in nuclear weapons, and said it
deprived Congress of its ``oversight function.''
   Opponents of the accord said they had failed to work out a
compromise with the State Department and may move to kill the
agreement next week.
   The accord, signed in November, gives Japan advance permission
for 30 years to recover plutonium from the fuel the United States
supplies for its nuclear power plants after it is used.

   Gallaudet University students declared
Thursday that Elisabeth Ann Zinser, the new president of the school
for the deaf, is unwelcome on the campus and vowed to keep her out,
although a congressman wants her to learn firsthand about the
students' concerns.
   Students have been protesting the selection of Zinser, who is
not deaf and does not know sign language, and their demonstrations
have halted virtually all instruction for four days. They have
promised to continue their protests until she resigns.
   They threatened to seize the president's campus house and office
if Zinser made her way past students blocking entrances to the
school. The doors to the administration building were chained shut
Thursday, and no administrators were seen on campus.

   Nine years ago, federal health officials set nine
goals for reducing fatalities from injuries in the United States by
1990. Thursday, officials predicted at least six of those goals
will be met.
   The fatality rates from many types of injuries _ such as car
accidents, house fires and drownings _ have dropped since 1979,
when the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced its
1990 goals, the Centers for Disease control reported Thursday.
   But in some cases, the rates have not fallen as far as the
government had hoped, the CDC said. While authorities expect to
meet the goals on reducing deaths from car crashes, childhood
household accidents, house fires and gun accidents, the goals for
reducing deaths from falls and drownings won't be met.
   ``Achieving the 1990 objectives ... will require the coordinated
efforts of federal, state and local agencies, ... academic
institutions, professional associations and private entities,'' the
Atlanta-based CDC said in its weekly report.
   Here, from the CDC report, are the nation's 1990 goals for
reducing deaths from injuries, and the progress being made:
   _ Reducing the nation's annual motor vehicle fatality rate, from
23.6 such deaths per 100,000 Americans in 1978 to 18 per 100,000 in
1990: By 1984, the rate had fallen to 19.6, and the goal is
projected to be met, in part because of a reduction in
alcohol-related fatalities.
   _ Reducing the motor vehicle fatality rate for children under
15, from 9 per 100,000 in 1978 to 5.5: By 1984, the rate had fallen
to 6.6, and the goal is projected to be met.
   _ Reducing the death rate from falls from 6.2 per 100,000 in
1978 to 2.0: The rate had fallen only to 5.1 by 1984, and the goal
is not expected to be reached. People over 65 continue to have high
death rates from falls _ for example, in 1984, 10.2 such deaths per
100,000 people age 65-74, and 147 per 100,000 people over 84.
   _ Reducing the death rate for children under 15 in home injuries
from 6 per 100,000 in 1978 to 5: The 1984 rate was 4.9, already
meeting the objective.
   _ Reducing the drowning rate from 3.2 per 100,000 in 1978 to
1.5: The rate had fallen only to 2.3 in '84, and the goal is not
expected to be met.
   _ Reducing the number of deaths in residential fires from 5,401
in 1978 to 4,500: The objective was reached in 1984, when 4,466
Americans died in such fires.
   _ Reducing the number of deaths in firearm accidents from 1,806
in 1978 to 1,700: The goal was met in 1984, when 1,668 such deaths
were reported.
   _ Reducing the suicide rate among 15-24-year-olds from 12.1 per
100,000 in 1978 to 11: The rate is going up, not down. It was 12.2
per 100,000 in 1984, up slightly from 1978 and up about 200 percent
from 1950. The CDC noted that various suicide prevention approaches
have been tried in communities, but the effectiveness is not known.
   _ Reducing the homicide rate among black males aged 15-24 from
70.7 per 100,000 in 1978 to 60: This goal will probably be met,
according to CDC researcher Dr. Richard Sattin. The rate had fallen
in 1984 to 61.5. This goal was set recognizing the high homicide
rate among young black men, Sattin said, noting that the national
homicide rate in 1984 was 8.4 per 100,000 Americans.

<HEAD>In South Carolina, Jackson Should Fulfill Chant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID REED</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson is the favorite son and
front-runner in South Carolina's Democratic caucuses Saturday,
leaving the division of the remaining delegates among the other
presidential candidates as the only question mark.
   Jackson was born and raised in South Carolina, one of two states
he won in his 1984 presidential race.
   Jackson, who plans a homecoming campaign trip Friday, has the
overwhelming support of the state's black voters, who make up more
than one-third of the electorate, and got an average of 10 percent
of the white vote in other Southern states on Super Tuesday.
   Between a quarter and a half of South Carolina Democrats
traditionally remain uncommitted at the caucus meetings to give
themselves more maneuvering room through the nominating process.
They usually choose a candidate at the county or state convention.
   That leaves few delegates for the rest of the field. But in a
tight national race in which no candidate appears to be able to
capture the majority of delegates, every one helps.
   ``This certainly increases the importance of South Carolina
because the delegate count is so close,'' said Kevin Gray, state
coordinator for Jackson.
   The candidates are relying on grass-roots organizing, telephone
banks and direct mail to lure Democrats to the caucus; none is
buying television advertisements.
   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr., who plans to campaign in the
state on Friday, has the largest organization in the state and the
most endorsements from elected officials, who wield strong
influence at the caucuses.
   Gore also has the momentum from his strong showing across the
South Tuesday, which lessened the perception among some South
Carolinians that he's not electable.
   Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, who traveled across the state
Wednesday and Thursday, has a skeletal organization. But his few
endorsements are the biggest _ former Govs. Dick Riley and Robert
McNair and all of the South Carolina Democratic congressmen who
have chosen sides.
   Dukakis has an even smaller local organization.
   All of the competing state campaigns except Gore's has conceded
that Jackson will win the lion's share of the 44 delegates at stake.
   ``I don't think there is any doubt that Jesse Jackson will
win,'' said Bill Prince, Gephardt's state coordinator.
   House Speaker Robert Sheheen, Gore's state chairman, said
``there's really no way of knowing'' whether the Tennessee senator
can upset Jackson. ``We're not conceding anything to anybody.''
   Gore, who is the only candidate with an outside chance of
upsetting Jackson, is promoting his strong ties to the South and a
strong defense, which plays will in the Palmetto State.
   Gephardt is hoping to use his trade policy to gain votes in the
state, which has seen its largest industry _ textiles _ severely
weakened by cheap foreign imports.
   But most political scientists and campaign officials agree that
because the Democratic field is so large and so close together and
because a large number of delegates probably will remain
uncommitted, the results Saturday will be inconclusive.
   Take Riley's assessment Thursday, for example: ``Jackson will do
very well. Gore is well organized. Dukakis will get a piece of the
vote and Gephardt will get his share.''
   South Carolina's Democratic leaders decided against following
the crowd on Super Tuesday, when all of the other Southern states
held primaries.
   ``They decided to nestle in the days of old,'' Clemson
University political science professor Steve Wainscott said
Thursday.

<DATELINE>FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of this sprawling military
base and neighboring towns mourned again Thursday for victims of an
Army aviation accident, this time 17 soldiers killed in a
helicopter collision.
   The members of the elite 101st Airborne division died Tuesday
when helicopters on separate night training missions slammed into
each other.
   The crash was the worst in Fort Campbell history and the worst
Army aviation accident since 248 Fort Campbell soldiers died Dec.
12, 1985, when a chartered jet bringing them home for Christmas
from a Mideast peacekeeping mission crashed in Canada.
   ``I think any soldier will tell you that when you fly as many
hours as they do and perform the exercises they do, you can expect
things to happen,'' said Charlie C. Gentry, a motel owner in
Clarksville, Tenn., the closest town to Fort Campbell.
   Even so, he said, ``To me it's kind of like hearing about maybe
a real close friend I had in high school, and hadn't seen for a
while, getting killed in a car wreck. So even though I didn't know
them there's more of a feeling of loss than with other news
stories.''
   Army crash investigators listened to air traffic control tapes
and interviewed witnesses in an effort to learn the cause of the
accident. Spokesmen said specifics would not be released until a
full report was made, probably within 90 days, but said some
details emerged from talks with air controllers and witnesses.
   One of the helicopters was leading a formation of three UH-60
Black Hawks headed east at an altitude of about 250 feet toward the
airfield, investigators said. The lead aircraft was struck
broadside by another Black Hawk that was flying alone about six
miles from the airfield. The remaining two aircraft were not
damaged and landed safely.
   The formation of three helicopters was returning infantry troops
from a live-fire exercise, said Fort Campbell spokesman Maj. Randy
J. Schoel. Aircraft flying over the reservation under visual flight
rules, as the four copters were, are not generally tracked by
control tower radar, and are responsible for avoiding each other,
Schoel said.
   The pilots were wearing night vision goggles that amplify
available light and were supposed to have been in radio contact
with the fort's control tower, the Army spokesman said.
   ``Generally the (helicopters' running) lights are dimmed to the
point where they are not visible to the naked eye, but they are
obvious to someone wearing goggles,'' Schoel said.
   He added, ``Fort Campbell flies every night with night vision
goggles. It's as routine here as driving at night in your car.''
   Gentry, manager of the Winner's Circle Motel about 200 yards
from the fort's main gate, lowered the motel's American flag to
half-staff.
   Further down the commercial strip at the Snow White Pawn Shop,
owner Morrell V. Boyd noted some of the signs businesses were
putting up. One, at an army surplus store read: ``Our prayers are
with you, Fort Campbell.''
   ``People are putting up signs on the marquees, but it goes
deeper than that,'' said Boyd, 51. ``It's sort of a helpless
feeling, too. You're not sure what to do.''
   A welcome center for the families of victims was being prepared
on the post and memorial services were scheduled for next Wednesday
at the fort's chapel.
   Gentry said the mourning among those in the community would be
tempered by an appreciation of the risks the servicemen undertake
regularly.
   ``There's a lot of loss, but a lot of pride, too,'' Gentry said.
``I feel a lot of pride in those guys.''

<HEAD>Applicants Eager To Work In China Start Phoning Agency</HEAD>

   Applicants started phoning a few hours after
China announced it would accept the Peace Corps for the first time
and the agency said Thursday it is eager for negotiations with the
Chinese to set the terms of the program.
   Though the concentration is likely to be on English teachers,
China still must decide what special skills it wants the volunteers
to have, where they will serve and how large the Peace Corps
program would be.
   The agency also will have to put volunteers for the program
through a rigorous testing program that rejects four out of five
applicants, said Arlen Erdahl, director of recruiting for the Peace
Corps.
   ``We'll be just as careful as we always are,'' Erdahl told a
news conference.
   The United States, in a drive for better relations with China,
had been giving Chinese officials information about Peace Corps
programs for years and began discussions of the issue in 1984.
   On Wednesday, Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian announced during an
appearance at the National Press Club that China had agreed to
accept volunteers and would work out the details with U.S.
officials.
   A few hours later, Karl and Katherine Brandt of Lexington, S.C.,
heard a radio news report about it and phoned the regional Peace
Corps office in Atlanta to volunteer.
   ``We've always wanted to do something like this; we visited some
Peace Corps people in Grenada once and when we heard about China we
decided this might be a neat idea,'' Brandt said in a telephone
interview.
   The 55-year-old chemist said he and his wife, a nurse, have
never lived outside the United States but ``we'd be interested in
going to China.''
   The Peace Corps has been sending American teachers, technicians,
professionals and community workers to foreign cities and villages
since 1961, when President Kennedy started the agency to improve
America's overseas image.
   The biggest country to accept volunteers had been India, which
had Peace Corps programs between 1962 and 1976, but China is the
most populated country and Erdahl said America's ``fascination''
with that nation is likely to spur applications for the corps.
   He noted, however, that while applicants for the Peace Corps are
asked to state their preferred assignments, they are not guaranteed
being sent to a specific country.
   There are currently 64 countries with Peace Corps programs. The
process of establishing the agency's relationship with China will
be the same as it was for the others. It could take between two
months and two years.
   ``This is just the starting gong,'' said John Scales, the
agency's general counsel.
   After a series of meetings, China will make a formal request for
a Peace Corps presence, a team of agency officials will visit the
country and the two sides will hammer out an agreement on numbers
of volunteers, where they will do their work and what they will do.
   Erdahl and several other Peace Corps officials who appeared at
the news conference suggested that they expected China to be most
interested in Peace Corps English teachers. The agency has become a
specialist in teaching English as a second language and runs such
programs in 33 countries.

   A special program to store grain in river
barges in the fall of 1986 to make way for the new harvest cost
taxpayers nearly a dollar a bushel to operate for four months,
according to the General Accounting Office.
   Overall, the $62 million cost was sharply higher than the
storage fees normally paid by the government for grain inventories
in elevators and farm bins. The program was announced in August
1986 as one of a number of emergency measures to help relieve
pressure on elevators getting ready for another bumper corn harvest.
   The GAO, an investigative agency of Congress, said in a recent
report to Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., that the Agriculture
Department awarded storage contracts to a dozen grain companies. A
total of about 64.9 million bushels of grain _ 98 percent corn and
2 percent soybeans _ was loaded on 1,253 barges along the Illinois,
Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio rivers.
   All of the barge grain originated from the Corn Belt states of
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska,
Ohio and Wisconsin, the GAO said. Most had been in country and
terminal elevators in those states, but some had been stored by
producers on their farms.
   Eventually, the department's Kansas City Commodity Office, which
handled the program, disposed of most of the barge grain by trading
it to the contractors for grain they had stored in inland
elevators. The remainder was sold, redeemed by farmers or returned
to storage elsewhere.
   ``We estimate that the additional cost of the special barge
storage program, over and above the normal costs for shipping,
storing and disposing of the grain, was about $44.8 million, or an
additional cost of 69 cents per bushel to store the grain for an
average of four months,'' the GAO said.
   The estimate by GAO was made because the department's
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service ``did not
separately accumulate total cost data for the program.'' However,
GAO said its estimates were based on reviews of contracts and other
information provided by the agency.
   ``The estimated cost of storing the 64.9 million bushels of
grain was about $62.2 million, or 96 cents per bushel,'' the GAO
said. ``This includes the additional cost of the program (about
$44.8 million) and the cost that would have been incurred in the
normal course of storage (more than $17.3 million).''
   Corn market prices nationally averaged $1.73 per bushel when the
program was announced and dropped to $1.40 in October 1986, the
peak of the new harvest.
   Investigators said they estimated the department's Kansas City
Commodity Office paid the 12 contractors about $45.5 million and
that an additional $16.7 million went to others for charges related
to the barge-stored grain.
   The GAO said the Kansas City office ``agreed with our
methodology and results'' in estimating the payments.

<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge who suggested during his
re-election campaign that his opponent should stay home with her
young children has been turned out of office in a landslide.
   State District Judge John McKellips' ex-wife and six children
had endorsed his opponent, assistant county attorney Mary Anne
Bramblett, in Tuesday's Democratic primary.
   Ms. Bramblett outpolled McKellips 32,412 to 10,752 and she is
assured of taking office because there is no Republican on the
November ballot.
   Ms. Bramblett, a political newcomer, attributed her victory to a
negative image that may have started with McKellips' bitter divorce
in 1985. Lillian McKellips sued for divorce, claiming McKellips was
having an affair with his 1984 campaign manager, Margaret Randle.
   McKellips married Ms. Randle two months after the divorce was
granted. He gained publicity again last summer, when police were
summoned to the courthouse to quell a quarrel between him and his
new wife.
   Last month, Lillian McKellips and the couple's six children
endorsed Ms. Bramblett, citing McKellips' treatment of them. A
couple of weeks later, in an address at a sheriff's deputies'
meeting, McKellips questioned Ms. Bramblett's qualifications,
partly because she is a mother.
   ``She had to take some time out for maternity leave to have two
small children, so I don't know how much time she's actually spent
working as an attorney,'' he told the deputies.
   While attacking his opponent for taking time off to care for her
newborns, McKellips criticized working mothers by linking absent
mothers to overcrowded prisons.
   The next day, the judge amended his comments, saying ``it would
have been more correct to have used the term `parent' rather than
`mother.''
   Ms. Bramblett, whose children are 3 and 4 years old, said at the
time: ``Everybody got the clear message that (McKellips believes) I
am not qualified to be a judge because I'm a woman and a mother.''
   County Judge Luther Jones, who recruited Ms. Bramblett to run,
said the victory was ``truly an epochal event in El Paso's legal
history. The image of both the attorneys and the entire judiciary
have suffered immeasurable harm during the McKellips tenure on the
bench.''

   A shortage of track inspectors has contributed
to worn railroad switches in CSX Transportation Co.'s
Baltimore-Pittsburgh division, a federal agency said Thursday in an
audit prompted by a series of freight train accidents.
   The Federal Railroad Administration, which is part of the
Transportation Department, said that track along main routes is
generally in top condition in the division, which includes the
District of Columbia and parts of Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia,
West Virginia and New York.
   But the audit also found that ``the training, equipping, and
numerical strength of the maintenance of way forces in this
division are inadequate, a factor which threatens the company's
capacity to maintain the quality of its track over the long term.''
   Maintenance of way employees inspect track. Because manpower
levels are low, the audit said, ``the districts assigned each CSX
track inspector are too large to be covered by a single individual.
Inspectors compensate by focusing their efforts on main line track,
which is almost uniformly in excellent condition.
   ``But the trade-off lies in cursory inspections of turnouts,''
or switches that allow a train to move from one track to another,
the audit said. ``The declining condition of these turnouts have
been a major problem on the line.''
   ``Worn turnouts or improperly performed track maintenance were
factors in several of the CSX derailments occurring in 1987,'' the
audit said.
   It said turnouts throughout the division were ``replete'' with
loose adjustable rail braces, missing cotter pins and other
problems. ``The entire gamut of defective turnout conditions
addressed by FRA track standards could be found in one form or
another'' in the division, it said.
   CSX, in a statement issued from its Rail Transport Group in
Jacksonville, Fla., said it already had begun a retraining program
_ taught in part by railroad administration instructors _ for track
inspectors, foremen, road masters and others working on the tracks.
   In addition, it said it had reached an agreement in the last few
months with the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees ``to
increase the number of people involved in track inspection.'' It
did not specify how many would be added.
   The statement noted that the audit had found a well-maintained
signal system, and had expressed no ``overriding concerns'' about
the transportation of hazardous materials.
   The audit also said the railroad administration detected ``an
apparent engineering problem'' in several sections of CSX track
near Confluence, Pa. It added that CSX already has begun to
reconstruct or move switches in the area.
   Last May, a CSX chemical tanker train derailed in Confluence,
splintering a control tower and killing its operator, and forcing
nearby residents to evacuate. It was the third derailment in the
southwest Pennsylvania community in five months.
   CSX trains also were involved in two derailments last year in
the Washington area. In June, 21 cars from a 134-car train
derailed, temporarily halting subway service from suburban Silver
Spring, Md., and Takoma Park, Md. In September, 14 cars on a CSX
train derailed in northeast Washington, damaging 500 feet of Metro
subway track, an electrical power station and a warehouse.
   Although accidents prompted the audit, none were specifically
addressed in the document. As part of the audit, more than 1,800
miles of track were inspected last fall.

<HEAD>Crackdown On Drug In Hog Carcasses Eases Japanese Concerns About
US Pork</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A move by the Agriculture Department to crack
down on illegally high traces of a suspected cancer-causing drug
found in hog carcasses has eased concern in Japan that pork imports
from the United States may be tainted, officials said Thursday.
   Japan had initiated a program to hold and test all U.S. pork
imports, which American livestock interests feared might jeopardize
foreign sales. The drug involved is sulfamethazine, commonly used
by swine producers to prevent certain kinds of disease and as a
feed additive to promote faster growth.
   Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service, said USDA and Japanese officials
have agreed on testing requirements for pork shipped to Japan.
   Crawford said Japanese officials ``have been favorably impressed
with U.S. efforts'' initiated on March 7 to increase testing of
pork products for sulfamethazine residues in the 100 largest U.S.
pork plants.
   ``U.S. pork produced after March 7 must carry a statement on the
export certificate that the product originated from one of the 100
plants undergoing increased residue testing,'' he said. ``Japan
will not further test these products for sulfamethazine residues.''
   Pork exported before the new controls went into effect will be
tested further for the drug, either in Japan or the United States,
he said.
   ``I am very pleased with this agreement,'' Crawford said.
``Along with our increased testing, it ensures the safety of U.S.
pork products and reaffirms the integrity of the U.S. pork
industry.''

   Chita Rivera, whose left leg has been held
together by 12 screws since a car accident two years ago, says she
never doubted she'd be dancing again one day.
   Now, the longtime Broadway star, who is touring the country in a
revival of ``Can-Can,'' has asked the producers to add more dancing
to her new role, she said in an interview with Parade magazine.
   ``I'm not a Pollyanna; it hurts to dance,'' said Rivera, 55.
``But you don't keep telling yourself that.''
   She sometimes felt like quitting during physical therapy, when
``I would feel like I was going to hit the ceiling.'' But her
positive side prevailed.
   ``There are some people whose spirits are so high, their
determination so great, that you practically have to shoot them to
get them down,'' she says. ``I guess I'm one of those people. The
spirit is the strongest thing there is.''

   Meanwhile, five Rockettes are suing Radio City Music Hall and
the producers of the touring show, charging them with false
advertising and violating the agreement with the dancers' union.
   The touring company advertisements say that 14 Rockettes are
dancing with Rivera in the production, according to Bernard B.
Cohen, attorney for the five. However, he said, only four real
Rockettes are in the 39-city tour, which started Jan. 29.
   ``Instead of dancing with Chita Rivera, the real Rockettes are
doing a tap dance on the unemployment line,'' he said.
   The contract between Radio City and the dancers' union, the
American Guild of Variety Artists, specifies that only Rockettes on
the official roster be hired for productions featuring the
Rockettes, Cohen said.
   The five dancers are seeking $2 million in damages.
   Radio City has maintained that the five could not handle the
dance routine and that the ``imposters'' are new Rockettes.
   The producers of the show are Kan Kan National Co., the Troika
Company Inc. and Trice Talent Payment Inc.

<HEAD>Kissinger Says Israel Should Hold Elections, Reject Peace
Conference</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
said Thursday that Israel should hold early elections in order to
resolve an ``intolerable'' political problem.
   In a television interview taped for broadcast this weekend on
the syndicated ``One on One'' interview program, Kissinger also
reiterated his position that Israel should give Jordan the occupied
Gaza Strip and densely populated parts of the West Bank.
   Gaza was under Egyptian control before Israel captured it in the
1967 Mideast war, but Kissinger said it should now be given to
Jordan. He did not explain.
   Kissinger said Israel and the United States should stay away
from an international peace conference proposed by Secretary of
State George P. Shultz.
   ``I think there should be elections in Israel. It's desirable.
You have a prime minister and a foreign minister who are cutting
each other up,'' he said.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, head of the right-wing
Likud bloc, and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who leads the Labor
Party, have both considered moving the elections up from November.
   ``Each side is trying to line up the United States and other
foreign countries in their support. It's an intolerable situation.
So the earlier they have an election and get unified, the more
important it is,'' Kissinger said.
   Kissinger, who mediated Israeli agreements with the Arabs in the
mid-1970s, said he would prefer that the United States help
negotiate peace between the sides without interference from the
other four permanent members of the U.N. Security Council _ the
Soviet Union, China, England and France.
   ``I'd prefer Shultz to do it alone,'' he said.
   All the other countries will press for Israeli withdrawal to its
1967 borders, he said. ``I think those will guarantee the
destruction of Israel,'' Kissinger said.
   He said a formula must be found under which Israel would give
back some of those territories but retain sufficient lands to
guarantee it a defensible buffer zone.

<TEXT>
   A former Black Panther convicted of
murdering two guards in a bloody 1971 San Quentin escape attempt
walked out of prison on bail Thursday, almost two years after a
judge ordered that he get a new trial.
   ``I feel great. ... I'm just very happy,'' Johnny Spain told
reporters at the front gate of the state prison at Vacaville, 50
miles east of San Francisco.
   ``I won't let anyone down who has supported me and there have
been many who supported me,'' he said, adding he was prepared to
deal with the challenges of living on the outside after 21 years
behind bars.
   Spain was hugged and congratulated by attorneys and
investigators who worked on his case, and members of their families.
   Attorney Dennis Riordan said Spain had promised to attend a play
in San Francisco on Thursday night with the 10-year-old daughter of
one of his supporters. Riordan said Spain would remain in the San
Francisco area until at least Wednesday for court appearances, then
planned to visit Los Angeles to see his wife and children.
   Some $100,000 of Spain's bail has been posted but $250,000 in
property must be guaranteed by Wednesday, Riordan said, adding that
he anticipated no problems.
   U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson, who had previously
granted Spain a new trial in the ``San Quentin Six'' case, a state
lawyer's request Wednesday to delay bail until the state parole
board reconsiders his case.
   Spain, 38, has been behind bars since December 1966, when he was
arrested for a murder and robbery in Los Angeles.
   He later became the only prisoner convicted of murder in a 1971
uprising in which George Jackson, widely known for his book of
prison writings, ``Soledad Brother,'' was killed, along with two
other prisoners and three guards.
   Authorities said Spain, seen running from a maximum-security
unit with Jackson, conspired with him in an escape attempt that led
to the killings.
   Henderson reversed Spain's convictions in 1986, saying he had
been denied a fair trial by being required to wear heavy shackles
for every court appearance during the five years of proceedings.
   The state's appeal of the ruling is to be argued Monday before
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   On Tuesday, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Kathleen Parker
ordered Spain paroled immediately from the sentence he has been
serving for the 1966 murder, a sentence that had kept Henderson
from granting bail earlier.
   She found that the parole board had improperly lengthened his
sentence nearly six years by applying regulations passed in 1976 to
disciplinary violations committed in 1970 and 1971.
   Riordan said Spain had spent twice as long in prison as the
average sentence for a similar crime.
   Lawyers said Spain would be living in San Francisco and working
as an electrician while his case is on appeal. Henderson's order
allows him to travel within the state and visit his wife, whom he
married while in prison, and two young sons in Los Angeles.

<HEAD>Iran Said Building Silkworm Platforms in New Area of Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran has begun constructing crude launch pads
for Silkworm missiles on the island of Abu Musa in the Persian
Gulf, potentially expanding the area within which it can menace
shipping, U.S. military sources said Thursday.
   The defense officials, who agreed to discuss the matter only if
not identified, stressed that American intelligence agencies so far
had failed to detect any effort by Iran to actually send Silkworm
missiles over to the small island.
   Iran has built similar launch pads at other sites on its main
coastline without ever deploying any actual missiles, one source
noted.
   ``But it's still significant because it would really extend the
coverage of these missiles ... if they deployed Silkworms there,''
another official said.
   The Silkworm is a Chinese-built variant of an old Russian
missile that can be fired from mobile launchers on land against
ships. The missiles have a range of about 50 miles and while not
particularly accurate, they carry a large warhead packed with
conventional explosives.
   According to U.S. sources, Iran has acquired more than 100
Silkworms and stored the majority of them at a large naval base at
Bandar Abbas near the Strait of Hormuz, the sole entrance to the
Persian Gulf.
   Although concrete launch pads aren't essential for the Silkworm
truck launchers to operate, the Iranians nonetheless have
constructed such pads at several sites along the coastline
overlooking the strait. As a result, American warships escorting
tankers in and out of the gulf normally go to battle stations for
the passage and Navy jets provide air cover just in case a missile
attack is mounted.
   Abu Musa is a small, Iranian-controlled island inside the Strait
of Hormuz, roughly 50 miles into the gulf and almost in the middle
of the waterway. It long has been used by Iran as a base for
gunboats that have attacked commercial shipping.
   If Iran were to deploy Silkworms on Abu Musa, ``it would be
doubling the arc (of space) that it can threaten,'' one source said
Thursday.
   ``It definitely would extend our area of vulnerability up into
the gulf,'' another official agreed.
   ``We'd have to get pretty serious about (watching) that
island,'' added a third source.
   All the officials stressed that construction on the island had
begun only recently and was proceeding slowly.
   ``But it is assessed to be Silkworm firing platforms,'' said one.
   The United States has been escorting reflagged Kuwaiti tankers
in the gulf since last July. Kuwait, a key ally of Iraq in the
Iran-Iraq war, requested the protection after Iran began singling
out its ships for attack.
   The 16th convoy operation of 1988 and the 38th overall began
Tuesday night and was said to be proceeding uneventfully on
Thursday, with two tankers steaming southbound from Kuwait toward
the Strait of Hormuz along with a Navy frigate.

<HEAD>Legislator Would Halt Aid to Five Latin Drug Countries OKed by
Reagan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Larry Smith on Thursday introduced
resolutions that would deny foreign aid and trade privileges to
Mexico, the Bahamas, Peru, Bolivia and Paraguay for alleged failure
to cooperate with U.S. anti-drug efforts.
   Smith, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee's task
force on international narcotics control, said the five countries
were wrongly certified by President Reagan on March 1 as
cooperating with drug enforcement programs.
   ``Some of these `cooperative' countries have even actively
frustrated our efforts to stop the production of drugs and their
trafficking into the United States,'' Smith, D-Fla., told
reporters. ``It's time the president stands up and does more than
just saying no.''
   Smith and Reps. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., and Dante Fascell,
D-Fla., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the
purpose of the resolutions was not necessarily to cut off aid to
the five countries but to focus public attention on the
certification process and determine whether it can be improved.
   Under comprehensive anti-drug legislation enacted in 1986, the
president must certify annually that major drug-producing and
shipment countries have ``fully cooperated'' with the United
States, or they face loss of a year's worth of military and
economic development aid and U.S. support for international
development bank loans.
   Countries that are ``decertified'' also may suffer a wide range
of trade sanctions at the president's discretion. These include a
50 percent boost in import tariffs, abrogation of airline
agreements, loss of U.S. sugar quotas and a halt in preferred U.S.
customs treatment.
   Reagan recently certified all the 24 major drug countries as
fully cooperating with U.S. anti-drug efforts except for Panama,
Afghanistan, Syria and Iran, which were decertified, and for
Lebanon, Laos and Paraguay, which were certified for ``national
interests.''
   Under the law, Congress has 45 business days _ until May 13 _ to
overrule any of Reagan's recent aid certifications and 30 days _
until April 19 _ to disapprove of further trade privileges for any
countries the president certified as fully cooperating.
   Smith said Mexico should be penalized because it is the primary
source of heroin and marijuana entering the United States, and the
smuggling route for one-third of the cocaine destined for U.S.
consumption.
   He said opium production has increased at least 30 percent and
eradication has fallen by one-third since 1984. Smith said
laundering of illicit drug profits is extensive and that Mexico
provides safe haven for hundreds of drug traffickers indicted in
the United States.
   Smith criticized drug enforcement efforts by the other four
countries, especially the Bahamas, which he said is the major
transit point for half the cocaine and marijuana entering the
United States.
   At a hearing that Smith headed Thursday, Assistant Secretary of
State Elliott Abrams said that ``while we believe that Mexico is
capable of even greater effort against narcotics trafficking, we
also believe that Mexican cooperation ... is substantial and
justifies the president's decision to certify Mexico.''

<HEAD>Striking Oil Workers Return To Jobs Under Dismissal Threat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil workers returned to work Thursday
after the government began firing strikers, whose walkout paralyzed
oil and gasoline refineries for two days, the government-owned
State Petroleum Co. said.
   The strike began Tuesday, hitting hard at public transportation
and at factories that depend on oil or gasoline to operate.
   About half of State Petroleum's 7,000 workers were estimated to
have gone out on strike.
   Brazil's conservative government gave strikers until Thursday to
return to work or be fired. In previous strikes, the government
carried out similar threats.
   How many strikers were dismissed this time was not disclosed,
nor did the government say whether anyone would be reinstated.
   The government deployed troops to take over refineries and
gasoline stations Tuesday and arrested labor leaders.
   It rationed gasoline and motorists lined up for hours. Many
buses and taxis in major cities went out of service.
   The Federation of Petroleum Workers had rejected a 30 percent
wage increase which the government offered on condition that there
would be no strike for one year. The average petroleum worker earns
$350 a month, compared to $100 a month for other government
employees.
   Saul Soliz, leader of the union, said the no-strike condition
was a government maneuver designed ``to divide the labor movement
against the interests of workers.''
   The union said that the government planned to finance the wage
increase by firing 1,500 workers.
   The government conceded that there would be some dismissals to
finance the pay increase, but said they would not exceed 500.

<TEXT>
   Increasing competition within the city's
drug trade prompted a suspected dealer to lead police to a rival's
secret stash of heroin, authorities said Thursday.
   No arrests were made, but 443 small bags of heroin were
confiscated Wednesday, police said. The bags were worth $20 each
for a total street value of $9,000, said Detective William
Gallagher.
   The tipster cooperated with police because of growing
competition among dealers in the North Camden neighborhood, the
worst drug area in the city, Gallagher said.
   ``We couldn't lock him up even though we know this guy is a drug
dealer because he didn't have any on him. We got the stash, said,
`Thank you, very much,' and he split,'' Gallagher said.
   The owner of the drugs was not at the scene when officers
William Durham and Michael Comuso uncovered the stash 10 feet under
a loose brick in the archway of a vacant house, Gallagher said.
   Durham and Comuso had looked for the drugs for about a week,
combing through piles of trash and vacant and abandoned houses,
which Gallagher described as the favored hiding places for drugs.
   The tipster decided to help the officers after his rival began
cutting into his territory, Gallagher said.
   ``There's some conflict of interest up there,'' he said, adding
that drug dealers from Colombia and the Dominican Republic are
trying to take over a neighborhood where black and other Hispanic
dealers have traditionally worked.
   ``North Camden is the hot spot right now. The traffic just flows
through there, especially on Thursday and Friday after payday,'' he
said.
   He declined to release the name of the tipster, saying such
action might make the man a target for retaliation from his rivals.
   In a way, the new spirit of cooperation is an asset for law
enforcement officials who spend hours each day patrolling the
blighted area, he said.
   ``But I also foresee where somebody's going to get hurt up
there,'' he said. ``They'll shoot you in a heartbeat.''

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell on Thursday likened
the TV evangelism scandals with the Watergate affair and said ``the
cause of Christ is better off'' because of them.
   The crisis that ended the Nixon administration ``made it much
tougher for politicians since then,'' Falwell told the National
Association of Evangelicals.
   ``In the days ahead, it is going to be tougher for national
(ministry) leaders to misbehave,'' he said. ``Not impossible, but
tougher.''
   Falwell, a fundamentalist preacher who is not a member of the
association, appeared for the first time before the group, which
has 50,000 members and represents 72 denominations.
   An admission of sin last month by TV preacher Jimmy Swaggart and
allegations last year of sexual and financial misconduct by Jim
Bakker have led to a new code of moral and financial ethics for
religious broadcasters, Fallwell said.
   ``I think the days of the Rolls-Royces and Rolexes ... the days
in which social status is gauged by financial trappings, are
over,'' Falwell said at a luncheon sponsored by the National
Religious Broadcasters, an affiliate of the NAE.
   Falwell said that the Swaggart controversy had had little effect
on his own ministry and that he did not believe it had equaled the
general impact of the Bakker revelations on the religious broadcast
industry.
   ``It seems that all the fallout that was going to occur,
occurred last year,'' he said at a news conference after the
luncheon.
   However, he said that if similar scandals had occurred to him or
other, more conservative, ministers, ``we would be out looking for
other employment.''
   ``I'd rather be dead'' than be immoral, he said.
   Bakker, who admitted a tryst with a church secretary and who has
been accused of financial improprieties, was expelled from the
Assemblies of God church.
   Swaggart, who has been accused of paying a prostitute to perform
lewd acts, was suspended by the denomination and expects to return
to the pulpit.
   After Bakker resigned as head of PTL, Falwell headed the
ministry for several months before stepping aside.
   Falwell accepted an invitation to speak before the NAE in 1983
but withdrew after criticism from fellow fundamentalists. The
fundamentalist side of Protestant Christianity maintains a
theological separation from the more broadly based evangelical
organization.
   Falwell's ``Old Time Gospel Hour'' is broadcast around the world
on some 350 television stations. He is founder of the Moral
Majority movement and pastor of the 21,000-member Thomas Road
Baptist Church in Lynchburg, Va., the largest in the country.
   Turning to politics, Falwell praised former religious
broadcaster Pat Robertson but said he endorsed George Bush for the
presidency, even though Falwell had Ronald Reagan not to choose
Bush as his vice president.
   ``I'd love to see a Bush-Kemp ticket,'' he said referring to New
York congressman Jack Kemp.
   On the other side, Falwell said, ``I can't think of a single
Democrat running this year who I could hold my nose and vote for.''
   In a presidential preference poll conducted late Wednesday, some
100 NAE board members endorsed Bush, followed by Kansas Sen. Robert
Dole, Kemp and Robertson. Among Democrats, they favored Rep.
Richard Gephardt of Missouri.
   The last-place finish for Robertson ``confounded conventional
wisdom that he would be the near-unanimous choice of evangelical
leaders,'' said Richard Cizik, research director for the NAE in
Washington.
   But it was no surprise to those trying to gauge the support for
Robertson within the evangelical movement over the past two years.
In two previous polls, its leaders also placed Robertson fourth
among the GOP candidates.
   ``They just don't consider Robertson to be the most qualified
for the job,'' Cizik said.
   Among Democrats, Gephardt was slightly favored over Sen. Albert
Gore of Tennessee, with Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, Sen.
Paul Simon of Illinois and Jackson, a Baptist minister, trailing in
that order.
   Bush received 40 percent of the votes on the GOP side. Dole got
32 percent, Kemp 17 percent and Robertson 12 percent.
   Gephardt was ranked first among Democrats by 37 percent of the
board members. Gore received 33 percent, Dukakis 16 percent, Simon
11 percent and Jackson 5 percent.
   In two previous two polls, in March and October last year, Dole
was the winner with more than 40 percent of the votes, followed by
Kemp, Bush and Robertson.
   Although evangelicals are considered conservative and orthodox
in their religious views, they represent a broad spectrum of
political ideology and the board members are ``not necessarily a
reflection of the rank and file,'' said Cizik.
   The NAE, conducting a series of workshops and seminars for some
500 delegates, includes denominations as diverse as Reformed and
Pentecostal. Among its members are Baptists, Lutherans,

<HEAD>Ash, Sludge At Coal-Fired Plants Not Considered Hazardous Waste</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: SUBS 4th graf bgng: The agency, ... with spokesman's

   Ash and sludge produced by gas scrubbers that
remove sulfur dioxide at coal-fired plants generally does not need
to be regulated as hazardous waste, the Environmental Protection
Agency said Thursday.
   However, small quantities of waste produced in cleaning boilers
and purifying water do meet the definitions of hazardous wastes and
the agency said it will consider whether to bring them under
hazardous waste regulation.
   The conclusions were contained in a report to Congress on power
plant wastes required by 1980 amendments to the federal hazardous
waste law. Those amendments exempted such waste from regulation
until completion of the study. EPA now has until September to
decide what wastes, if any, to regulate as hazardous.
   The agency said it would defer studying wastes from oil-fired
plants, and coal combustion outside the utility industry.
Spokeswoman Robin Woods said the schedule for those studies had not
been decided, but the agency intended to complete them.
   Coal plants produce a lot of waste _ in 1984 about 69 million
tons of ash and 16 million tons of sludge from smokestack gas
scrubbers used to remove sulfur dioxide, a pollutant that helps
form acid rain. EPA said that in the year 2000 ash probably would
be 120 million tons and scrubber waste 50 million tons.
   Utilities spend $800 million a year in disposing of the waste at
$2 to $31 a ton, and the requirements for handling and disposal
under hazardous waste regulation would increase that to $70 per ton
or $3.7 billion.
   Ash and sludge may contain small quantities of arsenic, barium,
cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury and selenium. In general, these do
not leach out of the material in landfills to the extent that would
make them hazardous, though some samples ``did indicate hazardous
levels of cadmium and arsenic,'' EPA said.

<HEAD>Koop: U.S. Drug Abusers Spreading AIDS Faster Than Homosexuals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Intravenous drug addicts appear to be spreading
AIDS in the United States at a higher rate than homosexuals, whose
chances of contracting the disease could decline, U.S. Surgeon
General C. Everett Koop said Thursday.
   Addressing the First International Conference on the Global
Impact of AIDS, Koop said surveys in the United States indicate
that male homosexuals have ``undergone a very serious and positive
change in behavior'' to reduce their risk of contracting AIDS.
   ``We might even expect a decline in the rate of AIDS reporting
from this group in a year or so,'' he told about 1,000 health
specialists from 63 countries at London's Barbican Center. The
three-day conference closed Thursday.
   By contrast, Koop said, intravenous drug abusers have yet to
realize they face a high risk of contracting AIDS from sharing
blood-contaminated needles.
   ``Over the years, we've been singularly unsuccessful in
penetrating the drug-addicted culture with every other public
health message we ever had, including the one that says stop''
using drugs, Koop added.
   The U.S. official last January predicted a rise, but not an
explosion, in the number of AIDS cases among heterosexuals.
   In an interview with The Associated Press earlier Thursday, Koop
said public health officials must find ``some innovative and
creative ways'' of reaching drug abusers, who now pose the greatest
risk of spreading AIDS to the uninfected U.S. population.
   ``I think the major problem that we have in the States is how to
reach the intravenous drug abuser, which class seems to be the one
that is spreading the disease most rapidly at the present time,''
Koop said.
   According to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, 63
percent of the 55,167 cases of AIDS reported in the United States
have been among male homosexuals or bisexuals, 17 percent among
intravenous drug abusers and 7 percent among those who fall into
both categories.
   Koop said health policymakers should consider setting up a pilot
needle-exchange program to determine whether it could cut the rate
of AIDS infection among drug abusers who share needles.
   Under needle-exchange programs tried in Western Europe, drug
addicts can turn in used needles and syringes for free, sterile
equipment. There are conflicting opinions on whether such programs
have slowed the spread of AIDS.
   While stressing he was not proposing such a plan but rather
supporting those who call for it, Koop said drug abuse was the
likeliest way that aquired immune deficiency syndrome could spread
through the heterosexual population.
   The Geneva-based World Health Organization and the London School
of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine organized the conference to assess
the economic and social impact of the AIDS epidemic, which has
spread to at least 133 countries.
   Speakers discussed problems ranging from the AIDS threat to the
mining industry of Zambia, to efforts to prevent the spread of
infection in British prisons.
   AIDS is a disease in which a virus attacks the body's immune
system, leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections
and cancers.
   AIDS is most often transmitted through sexual contact, but can
also be transmitted through transfusions of tainted blood or blood
products. AIDS can also be passed from mother to child at or before
birth.

   Secretary of State George Shultz said Thursday
his plan for bringing Arabs and Israelis to the negotiating table
is ``the only game in town'' and outlined details for the first
time in public.
   Shultz, testifying on Capitol Hill, also indicated that the
United States would continue to push the plan even if Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir rejects it when he holds talks in
Washington next week.
   ``People have looked at our ideas, and while nobody is saying
yes, nobody wants to say no, because it's the only game in town,''
Shultz said.
   ``People will probably _ would even dodge and object and so on,
but we're going to keep working and see if we can't bring something
out of this,'' he added.
   Shamir has opposed the Shultz plan because it sets a timetable
for negotiations between Israel and the Arabs on the future of the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   President Reagan, meanwhile, said in an interview Thursday that
``a great element'' of Israel's coalition government supports the
peace plan and that he will try to persuade Shamir to drop his
objections to the proposal.
   ``I believe that peace is inevitable,'' Reagan said. ``We may
have some differences there as to how to achieve it but I don't
think anyone believes that we can go on just with a constant state
of warfare and unrest (in the Middle East).''
   Shultz, in testimony to the House Appropriations foreign
operations subcommittee, said the United States feels ``time is
awasting'' and wants talks between Israel and Arab countries to
begin by May 1. The talks would be under the auspices of the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council _ the United States,
the Soviet Union, China, England and France.
   ``It is essential, particularly from the standpoint of the Arab
side, that there be an auspices for these negotiations, something
that gives them legitimacy,'' he said.
   ``We proposed that this conference initiate these bilateral
negotiations, that it be a body that can receive reports from the
parties on the status of their negotiations, but that ... the
conference will not be able to impose solutions or veto agreements
reached.''
   In what appeared a slight shift, Shultz did not insist as he has
in the past that the Soviets could only participate if they resumed
the diplomatic tiesthey broke with Israel in 1967.
   ``However, I have told the Soviets ... that whether they come to
a conference or not, they cannot expect to play a genuinely
involved role in Middle East affairs'' until they re-establish
official relations with Israel and ease their restrictions on
Jewish emigration, he said.
   In the plan he presented to Israeli and Arab leaders last week,
Shultz stipulated that all the participants must recognize U.N.
resolution 242 and 338, which call for Israel to return lands it
captured from the Arabs in the 1967 Mideast war. In return, the
Arab states would have to recognize the Jewish state's right to
exist.
   Shultz did not speak directly of the three months of
Israeli-Palestinian clashes in which more than 80 Arabs have been
killed. But he referred to it, saying that ``people's minds are a
little more open now than they've been in some time, and we should
take advantage of that.''
   Under the plan, the Palestinians would be represented by a joint
delegation with Jordan, Shultz said.
   The initial negotiations would address ``transitional
arrangements'' for three years of Palestinian self-rule, he said.
The United States would present a draft proposal as a preliminary
working paper.
   Such negotiations could be concluded within six months because
much of the preparatory work has been completed, he said.
   The transitional arrangement could be put into place within
three months after the end of the negotiations. Immediately
following the six-month negotiations, the sides would begin
yearlong talks on the final status of the territories, he said.

   Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole jabbed
at Vice President George Bush on Thursday, saying his rival for the
GOP nomination was ``hiding from America.''
   Dole, after touring a rehabilitation hospital, stepped up his
attacks on the vice president for not agreeing to one-on-one
debates before next Tuesday's Illinois primary.
   ``I don't think he wants to stand up without notes and talk
about issues,'' Dole said. ``It's not a strength of his. His
strength is to run these TV ads that distort somebody's record.''
   Dole apparently was referring to television spots that the Bush
campaign has used to raise questions about the Kansas senator's
position on taxes. Dole blames his campaign's failure to
effectively counter the ads for his loss in New Hampshire.
   ``I think he's going to play it safe,'' Dole said of Bush.
``He's not going to debate Bob Dole. He wouldn't dare debate Bob
Dole for two hours without notes, without Roger Ailes.''
   Ailes is a media consultant.
   At nearly every campaign stop since he arrived in Illinois on
Tuesday, Dole has hammered away at Bush and challenged him to speak
out on the issues.
   ``It's almost impossible to separate Bush from (President)
Reagan because he's been standing next to him for seven years,''
Dole said. ``Unfortunately, I didn't have time to stand there. I
had to get Reagan's program passed.''
   Dole also is questioning Bush's ``electability,'' saying he
would be a stronger candidate for the party to field against
Democrats in November.
   ``My view is it's going to be a very tough, tough race for
George Bush,'' said Dole. ``He does not attract Democrats or
independents.''
   Dole said he would seek out supporters of Rep. Jack Kemp now
that the New York Republican has pulled out of the presidential
race. He expects to soon receive the endorsement of Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., a key Kemp backer in the state.
   Dole said he faces a ``steep hill to climb'' to defeat Bush.
   ``I have to do very well in this state,'' Dole said.
   ``Does that mean winning? That means doing very well.''
   Dole seemed to be backing off slightly from statements on
Wednesday that Illinois was a must-win state for his struggling
candidacy, but he dismissed questions from reporters on whether he
was scaling down his expectations in the state.
   Dole's first stop on Thursday was to the Rehabilitation
Institute of Chicago, where he toured the hospital and greeted
patients, many of whom were confined to wheelchairs.
   The medical center is just a short distance away from another
hospital where Dole underwent surgery 40 years ago for wounds he
suffered in World War II.
   One woman patient told Dole, ``You're not going to get
Bushwhacked in the Midwest.''
   Dole gave words of encouragement to some of the patients and
told them how it was difficult for him to regain the use of one of
his arms which had been paralyzed.
   ``I don't give up easy. I'm like everybody in this building,''
Dole said after his tour. ``You wouldn't walk out of here if you
gave up easy. So I'm a fighter.''

   A pact allowing Japan to retrieve plutonium
from U.S. nuclear wastes would leave the United States without
``effective control'' over reprocessing of the hazardous material,
the General Accounting Office has concluded.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, also found fault
with the agreement's provisions to guard against proliferation of
plutonium, the principal element in nuclear weapons, and said it
deprived Congress of its ``oversight function.''
   Opponents of the accord said they had failed to work out a
compromise with the State Department and may move to kill the
agreement next week.
   The accord, signed last November, gives Japan advance permission
for 30 years to recover plutonium from the fuel the United States
supplies for its nuclear power plants after it is used.
   Congressional opponents wanted the United States to have the
right to review the use of plutonium in any future Japanese
facilities on a ``case-by-case'' basis, and to be able to suspend
the agreement in a terrorism threat or other national security
situations.
   The congressional foes also sought to have the agreement
reviewed every five years.
   These changes would require renegotiating the terms with Japan,
which the State Department declined to do, said a congressional
source, speaking only on condition of anonymity.
   A leading opponent, Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said ``it is
extremely unfortunate the State Department has rejected a
compromise agreement. It is a bad agreement. It has serious flaws.''
   Cranston, chairman of the Senate Asia subcommittee, called on
the Reagan administration to withdraw the accord. ``Otherwise,'' he
said, ``it faces growing opposition'' in Congress.
   The GAO report was written by Milton Socolar, a special
assistant to the U.S. Comptroller General, and was dated Feb. 29.
It was obtained Thursday.
   The report said the agreement does not meet various requirements
of the Atomic Energy Act. It said giving ``blanket approval'' to
Japan for reprocessing plutonium ``would leave the United States
with no effective control over the life of the proposed agreement.''
   A U.S. official involved in the negotiations said, however, the
``safeguard concepts'' in the pact are adequate and that the
agreement could be suspended in the event of proliferation or a
terrorist threat.
   The official, speaking only if not named, said the agreement
``makes sure terrorists cannot get into the facilities.''
   In December, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in an
unusual move, voted 15-3 to return the pact to President Reagan and
asked that it be renegotiated. Opponents argued it sets a precedent
to encourage potentially hazardous trade in plutonium, which is a
potent cancer-causing agent.
   Opponents also complained the plutonium would be shipped over
Alaska and possibly other areas of the United States.
   On Tuesday, the State Department said the plutonium would be
shipped ``in accordance with rigorous physical protection and
safety requirements.''
   A statement issued by the Non-Proliferation Office said planes
carrying the plutonium soon will be able to fly non-stop from
Europe to Japan, taking a polar route. This would avoid overflights
of the United States, Canada or any other country.
   ``The administration is, therefore, prepared to rule out air
shipments of plutonium under the agreement from overflying or
landing in the United States, except in the case of aircraft
emergency,'' the statement said.
   Under the agreement, Japan would ship the spent nuclear fuel to
reprocessing plants in Britain or France, which would separate
plutonium from the waste. The plutonium then would be shipped back
to Japan by air.
   The congressional source said the statement was designed to ease
the concerns of Sen. Frank H. Murkowski, R-Alaska, but did not
basically alter the flaws in the agreement.
   Also, the source said, Richard N. Perle and Frank Gaffney,
former Defense Department officials, wrote members of Congress
urging rejection of the agreement as ``seriously flawed'' and
complaining that the Pentagon was not permitted to play a
meaningful role in the negotiations with Japan.
   Forty-five tons of plutonium could be airlifted from Europe to
Japan by the year 2000 under the pact. It takes 15 pounds to make a
bomb.
   Congress has until April 25 to block the agreement with Japan or
it takes effect.

<HEAD>Shultz Says US Aid `Embarrassing' Compared with Europe's</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz on
Thursday called U.S. foreign aid embarrassingly low compared with
the effort made by Western European countries.
   He was challenging Rep. David R. Obey, D-Wis., who chaired a
hearing at which Shultz testified.
   ``Mr. Chairman, you talked about burden sharing, but if we
compared our effort in that regard with our European friends, I
think we would see a somewhat embarrassing picture,'' Shultz said.
   He was immediately supported by the member who had been
questioning him, Rep. John Edward Porter, R-Ill.
   ``It's shameful, Mr. Secretary, it's absolutely shameful,''
Porter said. ``I certainly agree with you.''
   Shultz was apparently referring to figures for 1986, compiled by
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which
show that total U.S. development aid is high _ $9.56 billion for
1986 _ but low as a proportion of U.S. wealth.
   The OECD calculates that U.S. aid amounted to 0.23 percent of
the country's total production. By that measure Norway was at the
top of the list with 1.2 percent of its production, an effort more
than five times greater. The United States was close to the bottom
of the list. Only Austria was lower, with 0.21 percent.
   Shultz also made a comparison with the Soviet Union.
   ``The fact of the matter is ... the Soviets are spending
considerably more than we are in what we classify as as economic
and security assistance,'' he said. ``And their economy is half the
size of ours. So that our effort is relatively small.''
   According to the U.S. Agency for International Development, the
Soviets spent $3.68 billion on economic aid in 1986, equal to 0.33
percent of their national production.
   Obey had begun the hearing with an explanation of why Congress
provided smaller amounts for aid than had been requested by the
administration for countries where the United States has military
bases.
   ``We felt that the United States is getting the shaft from our
allies in terms of burden sharing around the world,'' he said.
   ``And we feel it's the obligation of our European allies to
carry a greater share of the load in supporting common defense
efforts. ... So it's not that we have any policy dislike for Spain
or for Portugal or for Greece or for any of the other countries
involved,'' he said.
   ``It's simply that when the U.S. taxpayer spends $1,100 on
average to support military and foreign expenditures, and the
(West) German taxpayer spends $450 and the Spanish taxpayer spends
$113 and the average for Europe is $318, we feel those are not good
conditions under which we ought to be making large commitments of
expenditures,'' he said.
   Obey, who chairs the foreign operations subcommittee of the
House Appropriations Committee, also complained of administration
proposals to lower spending on some domestic programs for education
and low-cost housing.

Satellite</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Corporation for Public Broadcasting told
Congress on Thursday it needs $200 million to replace an aging
satellite system that is due to expire in 1991.
   Donald Ledwig, CPB president, told a House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee that unless the satellite system is replaced, the
skies will go dark for public radio and television stations that
rely on it to receive programming from the Public Broadcasting
Service.
   ``Without funding for the satellite, there would be no way to
replace it unless we pulled it out of our budget,'' which would
leave little money for anything else, Ledwig said.
   CPB is asking Congress to authorize $395 million for CPB's
general operations for the year beginning Oct. 1, 1991. The board
also proposes its federal support be increased to $411 million in
fiscal year 1992 and to $427 million in fiscal year 1993. The $200
million for a new satellite system would be additional.
   The Reagan administration in its recent budget proposal asked
Congress to freeze CPB's funding at its current level of $214
million for fiscal years 1989 through 1991 and did not include any
funds for a new satellite system. Congress previously had
authorized CPB to receive $228 million in 1989 and $233 in fiscal
1990.
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the telecommunications
subcommittee, has introduced legislation that would split the
difference between what CPB wants and what the administration is
proposing.
   Some on the subcommittee, however, said that at a time of
soaring budget deficits, public broadcasters cannot count on
increasing their federal support.
   Rep. Michael G. Oxley, R-Ohio, said public broadcasters should
consider limited advertising between programs an a way to fill
their budget gaps.
   ``I am troubled by the intransigence of the (public
broadcasting) system on this important question,'' Oxley said.
   The Public Broadcasting Act prohibits advertising on public
radio and TV stations, but Oxley said this raises constitutional
free-speech questions.

<TEXT>
   Maj. Hugh Lindsay, who was killed Thursday in an
avalanche while skiing with Prince Charles, was a career army
officer who became a favorite aide of Queen Elizabeth II.
   Handsome, urbane, fun-loving and an expert skier, Lindsay was
out on the slopes at a resort in Klosters, Switzerland with the
39-year-old heir to the British throne when he was caught in an
avalanche.
   Buckingham Palace said Charles escaped unharmed.
   The prince helped dig out Lindsay, according to Press
Association, Britain's domestic news agency, but the major was dead
by the time he was airlifted to a nearby hospital.
   Lindsay, 34, was a close friend of Charles and Princess Diana.
   Last July, Diana and Prince Edward, the youngest brother of
Prince Charles, made a surprise appearance at Lindsay's wedding to
Sarah Brennan at the 10th-century Church of St. Nichola in Compton,
Surrey outside London.
   Mrs. Lindsay, who works in the Buckingham Palace press office,
is expecting the couple's first child in May.
   Lindsay was a major in the British army when he was appointed an
equerry, or aide, to the queen in October 1983. He spent three
years working closely with her before returning to full-time army
duty with the Prince of Wales' 9th-12th Royal Lancers in 1986.
   ``He was the perfect equerry, which means he was the perfect
courtier,'' said Anthony Carthew, court correspondent for
Independent Television. ``He was very good-looking and urbane and
witty.
   ``He was very popular with the queen ... popular indeed with the
whole royal family.''
   He also said Lindsay was a very strong skier.
   In his spare time, Lindsay played in a seven-man blues band
called ``Sweatband,'' which appeared at balls and society parties.
Baroness Isabelle Van Randwyck, a school friend of Diana, also
played in the band.
   Lindsay was vacationing at Klosters in 1986 with Charles and
Diana when Sarah Ferguson made one of her first public appearances
before the announcement of her engagement to Prince Andrew,
Charles' brother.
   The major was playfully prodded with an umbrella by Diana and
Sarah at the races at Royal Ascot last June, to the crowd's delight.

   The U.N. Human Rights Commission accepted Fidel
Castro's invitation Thursday to send its first delegation to Cuba
to investigate allegations of human rights abuses.
   The 43-nation body approved without a vote the decision drafted
by four Latin American countries to accept the invitation Cuba
extended Wednesday.
   Plans are for a six-member delegation, including the chairman of
the U.N. commission, to visit the Caribbean island this year and
report to the 1989 meeting.
   Before the decision, the United States and Latin American
countries led by Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and Peru, spent a day
negotiating acceptable conditions for a visit.
   In another action Thursday, the commission condemned Chile's
military government for violations including murder, kidnapping and
torture by security forces, continued curbs on basic civil rights
and intimidation by authorities.
   A resolution passed 34-0 cited ``acts of extreme violence from
all sources in Chile which have exacerbated the climate of
insecurity.'' Seven countries abstained, including the United
States, Japan and Brazil, and two did not vote.
   Armando Valladares, a former Cuban political prisoner who heads
the U.S. delegation to the rights commission, told a news
conference the two-year U.S. effort to have the commission examine
Cuba had forced Castro's hand.
   ``This visit has not been a voluntary gesture by Cuba,'' he
said, speaking in Spanish with simultaneous translation.
   A day of negotiations produced ``conditions and guarantees'' for
an impartial visit that did not exist when Cuba extended the
invitation Wednesday, said Valladares, who was released from 22
years in a Cuban prison six years ago. He called the commission
decision ``a triumph for human rights.''
   An official of the U.N. Center for Human Rights, K.F. Nyamekye,
said it was understood that the six members _ commission Chairman
Alioune Sene of Senegal and five others to be chosen geographically
_ would meet in Geneva for a week in May or June to plan their work.
   Cuba has been cited for such human rights violations as torture
and mistreatment of political prisoners by the United States and
international organizations, including Amnesty International.
   Castro's government denies the charges and fought the U.S.
effort to put its human rights situation on the agenda of the
commission, which meets every year for six weeks. Debate
intensified this year when Valladares, who wrote a book about
mistreatment and torture in prison, was chosen to lead the U.S.
delegation.
   After Thursday's decision, the United States withdrew a
resolution calling for the U.N. secretary-general to examine the
human rights situation in Cuba and report to the commission.
   Valladares said the plan adopted ``goes far beyond what we had
originally asked for. It is very important.'
   A member of the Cuban delegation said it would not have a
statement Thursday.
   The document approved is brief and does not give conditions of
the visit, saying only that a six-member team ``should visit Cuba
in order to observe the human rights situation'' and prepare a
report.
   Sene told the organization the investigating team would have
unrestricted access to information while in Cuba.
   They will visit Cuba for ``about five days'' in July or August,
then reconvene in Geneva in January to consider and adopt their
report, said Nyamekye.

<HEAD>Dartmouth Disciplines 4 Students For Harassing Black Professor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BETSY HENDERSON</BYLINE>

   Dartmouth College suspended two members of
a conservative student newspaper for two years Thursday and another
for two terms for harassing a black professor in his classroom.
   A fourth student staffer for the independent Dartmouth Review
was placed on disciplinary probation for one year for disorderly
conduct.
   The four white students had faced possible expulsion over a Feb.
25 confrontation with music Professor William Cole over a Review
article criticizing his class and his teaching ability.
   The article and the confrontation had drawn allegations of
racism against the Review and prompted demonstrations by black
students at the Ivy League school.
   The penalties imposed by the student-faculty Dartmouth Committee
on Standards take effect Wednesday, the end of the current academic
term.
   Christopher Baldwin of Hinsdale, Ill., John Quilhot of Fort
Wayne, Ind., John Sutter of St. Louis, and Sean Nolan of Lexington,
Mass., were charged with harassment, disorderly conduct and
invasion of privacy.
   Baldwin, a junior who is the Review editor, and Sutter, a senior
who is its executive editor, were suspended until the fall of 1989,
or six terms.
   Quilhot, a sophomore photographer, was suspended for two terms.
Nolan, a freshman contributor to the paper, was placed on
probation. Dartmouth operates on a three-term college year.
   Baldwin said the students will appeal.
   ``I knew we were going to get a sentence like that when we
walked into the hearing,'' Baldwin said. ``The hearing was
conducted in a lynch-mob hysteria.''
   ``They did what was politically expedient, not what was right,''
he said.
   The disciplinary panel found all four guilty of disorderly
conduct for failure to leave Cole's classroom after being asked
repeatedly to leave.
   Baldwin was guilty of harassment for initiating and persisting
in a ``vexatious oral exchange'' with Cole, and Sutter was guilty
of repeated ``aggressive, confrontational and particularly
vexatious'' behavior, the committee said.
   Cole, a specialist in African-American music and author of books
on jazz musicians John Coltrane and Miles Davis, sued the Review
for libel five years ago over an article questioning his competence
and saying he ``looks like a used Brillo pad.'' Cole later dropped
the suit.
   During nearly 16 hours of hearings last weekend, the four
students proclaimed their innocence and denied any racial
motivation.
   Founded in 1980 with support from such conservatives as Patrick
Buchanan and William F. Buckley, the Review repeatedly has been
accused of insensitivity to blacks, women and homosexuals.
   Baldwin led the group that approached Cole in a recital hall
after the professor finished a class.
   Baldwin said the Review wanted to give Cole another chance to
respond to an article in the Review several days earlier. In that
article the Review printed remarks, including profanities, that
Cole made in a telephone interview.
   Witnesses who testified before the committee last weekend agreed
that Cole became agitated and yelled and cursed when the four
approached him. Cole testified that he felt harassed and provoked,
and he accused the Review of bigotry.
   The invasion of privacy charge arose because Cole was
photographed and tape-recorded without permission.
   One witness, Luzmila Johnson, head of the Afro-American Society
at Dartmouth, testified that Sutter uttered a racial slur as he
left the recital hall. Sutter vehemently denied the charge.
   Two years ago, 12 people, most of them Review members, mounted a
sledgehammer attack on symbolic anti-apartheid shanties on the
college green.
   Three of the students were suspended. Seven others received
community-service sentences, including Baldwin.
   Dartmouth has nearly 4,100 undergraduates, nearly 7 percent of
them black.

   Republican Party officials said
Thursday they intend to award Puerto Rico's 14 GOP national
convention votes to Vice President George Bush and are considering
calling off the primary to do it.
   ``We haven't canceled the primary, but we are considering every
way possible not to have one,'' GOP vice chairman and local Bush
campaign manager Jose Dapena Thompson said. ``The reason is simple:
the nomination of George Bush has been practically assured.''
   However, the underlying issues at stake turn more on statehood
for the U.S. commonwealth than on presidential politics.
   The Republican primary is scheduled for March 20, when voters
are to cast ballots for slates committed to Bush; his main rival,
Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan.; or any other Republican candidate as a
write-in.
   Bush needs 1,139 votes to win the GOP presidential nomination.
His total Thursday was 705.
   Dole's campaign chairman in Puerto Rico, Alejandro Cruz, agreed
with Dapena Thompson, but he, too, was unsure whether it was
possible to cancel the primary, or somehow to require Dole's 14
delegates to vote instead for Bush.
   The Republican Party will meet Saturday to review its
alternatives.
   A Democratic primary also is set for March 20, at which 51
Puerto Rico's national elegates are at stake.
   The main issue for both parties is the political status of the
commonwealth, whose citizens enjoy most every right and obligation
as other Americans with the exception that they cannot vote for
president or Congress, and pay no federal taxes.
   The Popular Democratic Party of Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon
favors a continuation of commonwealth or limited autonomy. The
opposition New Progressive Party, which has strong ties with the
national Republican Party, wants Puerto Rico to be the 51st state.
   ``Our first goal is statehood and we have to be united to fight
for that,'' said Dapena Thompson, the mayor of the south coast city
of Ponce and the New Progressive Party's vice chairman.

   Four presidential candidates _ two Republicans
and two Democrats _ have sided with deaf students at Gallaudet
University who want a hearing-impaired person to head their school.
   Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., was the first to support the idea with a
letter on Feb. 18, before the selection of Elisabeth Ann Zinser was
made. Zinser, who was named the school's president on Sunday, is
not deaf and does not know sign language.
   In his letter, Dole noted the accomplishments of Gallaudet,
which is the nation's only school for the deaf, and asked, ``Isn't
it time for the university to once again lead the way, instead of
following it, and place a deaf individual in a position of public
responsibility?''
   Vice President George Bush's support came next, in a letter
March 1 to the committee searching for a new school president.
   ``As an entity funded by the federal government, Gallaudet has a
responsibility to set an example and thus to appoint a president
who is not only highly qualified, but who is also deaf,'' he wrote.
   The March 6 appointment of Zinser, an administrator at the
University of North Carolina at Greensboro, set off demonstrations
by students, alumni and faculty at Gallaudet that have virtually
paralyzed the campus.
   The protests drew support from two Democratic presidential
hopefuls.
   Democrat Jesse Jackson on Wednesday issued a statement
supporting the demonstrations and saying, ``The problem is not that
the students do not hear. The problem is that the hearing world
does not listen.''
   Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, also running for the Democratic
nomination, on Thursday called for Zinser's resignation.
   Simon, a longtime member of the Senate Labor and Human Resources
subcommittee on the handicapped, which has jurisdiction over
funding for Gallaudet, said Zinser's appointment was a ``slap in
the face to the entire purpose of the university.''
   Simon, who wears two hearing aids to compensate for a hearing
impairment, cited the job listing placed by the school's
presidential search committee, which said, in part:
   ``Broad and deep knowledge of deafness and the variety of issues
important to the higher education of hearing impaired persons is
necessary.''
   ``Even if Elisabeth Zinser were deaf,'' Simon said, ``the fact
that she doesn't meet this qualification demonstrates that she is
not the best candidate for the job.''

   Tate said more than half the campaign's 300 staffers were being
laid off.
   She declined to say who among the national staff was being let
go, saying workers were still being notified Thursday evening.
   ``It is significant _ it ranges from the top to the bottom in
every department,'' she said of the layoffs.
   Some of the layoffs had been planned for the period following
Super Tuesday, regardless of its outcome, she said.
   But Dole's campaign was reeling from its complete, 17-state loss
on that day. Vice President Bush won in 16 of the states and took a
giant step toward the GOP nomination.
   ``You have a much different campaign staff when you're trying to
compete in 17 states at once'' rather than one at a time, she said.
   She said the key members of Dole's traveling staff would be
unaffected by the cutbacks, naming press secretary Mari Maseng,
adviser Thomas Rath, campaign chairman William Brock and consultant
Kim Wells.
   She said the campaign would keep ``a full complement'' of staff
in Illinois.
   The news of the cutbacks came as Dole continued to campaign in
Illinois _ a state he said on Wednesday that he had to win.
   On Thursday, he appeared to back off on that contention, saying
instead he had to ``do very well'' in the state. He dismissed
questions from reporters on whether he was scaling down his
expectations in the state.
   At one point, however, he addressed the possibility of dropping
out, saying: ``I've been in this business long enough to know that
there comes a time you have to say, well, maybe it would happen.''

<TEXT>
   A storm dumped heavy snow in Utah, Colorado and Wyoming,
covering some mountain areas with up to 28 inches, shutting down
highways and abruptly ending spring-like weather in the region.
   The storm also generated high winds in the central and southern
Rockies and the central and southern Plains, creating blizzard
conditions in some areas.
   Winter storm advisories, watches and warnings were posted in the
Rockies and northern Plains through Friday. Up to 16 inches of snow
were expected in Colorado's mountains overnight.
   In Utah's mountains, 28 inches of snow blanketed Brian Head by
Thursday morning. Elsewhere in the state, Little Cottonwood Canyon
got 18 inches, and Big Cottonwood Canyon and Solitude 8 inches.
   Snow was heavy in parts of western Wyoming, with a foot of new
snow at Casper Mountain and Rock Springs, and wind gusts to 50 mph
created blizzard conditions.
   More than 200 miles of Interstate 80 were shut down in southern
Wyoming between Laramie and Rock Springs, and numerous roads in
Wyoming were closed.
   About 4,000 state employess left work early in Cheyenne and
Caspar, and many schools closed early.
   Snow also fell over parts of western and central Montana and
South Dakota.
   As the storm moved eastward, the temperature fell dramatically.
Rapid City, S.D., had a high in the low 70s on Wednesday, but
readings climbed only into the mid-30s early Thursday afternoon.
   Temperatures elsewhere in the northern high Plains were 20 to 30
degrees lower than readings on Wednesday.
   Gusty winds also buffeted western Kansas, the Nebraska Panhandle
and southern New Mexico, where Ruidoso had winds up to 63 mph.
   Rainshowers were scattered across the Carolinas into northern
Georgia as a storm system slowly moved into the Atlantic Ocean.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST
included 1.20 inches at Fayetteville, N.C., 0.91 inch at Charlotte,
N.C., 0.86 inch at Florence, S.C., 0.82 inch at Key West, Fla., and
0.67 inch at Hickory, N.C.
   Temperatures at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 21 degrees at Yellowstone
Park, Wyo., to 89 degrees at Cotulla, Texas. The morning low was 3
degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   Friday's forecast called for snow from the plains of Wyoming and
northern Colorado through the upper Mississippi Valley, showers and
a few thunderstorms scattered across the central Plains and lower
Missouri Valley, from much of Kansas and western Missouri into
central Iowa and southern Wisconsin, and mostly sunny or partly
cloudy skies elsewhere.
   High temperatures were expected to reach the 40s, 50s or 60s
across much of the nation, with readings in the 20s from Wyoming to
the northern Great Lakes and across northern New England, in the
30s from the northern Rockies through the central Intermountain
region, the central high Plains into central Wisconsin and northern
Michigan as well as central New England, in the 70s across the
southern California coast and from the upper Rio Grande Valley
through northern Texas, the lower Mississippi Valley and Gulf Coast
into much of Florida, and in the 80s across southern Texas.

<TEXT>
   African governments more than nature now cause
the famines that threaten millions of lives, a Reagan
administration official told Congress Thursday.
   ``Although natural factors are still present and important in
each of these countries, man-made factors predominate and drive the
seemingly intractable emergency situations and ever-escalating
needs,'' said Charles L. Gladson, assistant administrator for
Africa of the Agency for International Development.
   He listed as the ``most obvious'' factors:
   _internal strife and civil wars.
   _policies that fail to give incentives to farmers to grow enough
food.
   _poorly developed infrastructure, such as roads and railroads.
   _governments incapable of coordinating relief.
   Gladson's testimony was prepared for a hearing by the House
Select Committee on Hunger and the Foreign Affairs subcommittee
that deals with Africa. The hearing dealt with the crisis in
Angola, Mozambique, Ethiopia and Sudan.
   ``Even in the best of times, Ethiopia cannot feed itself with
its current policies,'' said Roy Stacy, deputy assistant secretary
of state for Africa.
   ``The U.S. government alone spent over $600 million for
emergency aid to save lives, but without incentive farming policies
such assistance does not result in recovery and provides little
resistance to the next drought,'' he said.
   According to the hunger committee, a drought in Ethiopia has
again resulted in crop failures and a food deficit of 1.3 million
metric tons, with 5.2 million to 8 million people at risk. It said
the U.S. government has provided more than $100 million in aid in
the current crisis.
   The administration view was endorsed by Rep. Tony Roth, R-Wis.
   ``Ethiopia, Mozambique and Angola _ is there some reason that
Mother Nature has singled out these three countries by chance? I
don't think so,'' he said.
   ``All of these countries share one other common trait: their
disastrous agricultural yields can be directly attributed to the
failures of collectivized farming and to a patent disegard for
human life,'' he said.
   All three have communist governments.
   He complained that a proposed resolution on famine relief,
introduced by Rep. Tony P. Hall, D-Ohio, and Mickey Leland,
D-Texas, contained no condemnation of the Ethiopian government of
Mengistu Haile-Mariam for withholding food as a means of combatting
rebel forces.
   He also criticized the proposed resolution for suggesting that
the U.S. government prevent refugees from crossing borders or going
into relief camps.
   ``It seems to me altogether inappropriate for it to to be a
policy of the U.S. government to prevent people from voting with
their feet and escaping from a brutal dictatorship,'' he said.

   Two 13-year-old girls were found guilty of
involuntary manslaughter Thursday in the slaying of a 12-year-old
boy who was forced to drink lighter fluid and suffocated with a
plastic bag over his head.
   Police said the girls Feb. 8 helped two teen-agers get into the
victim's apartment, where the boys attacked Antonio R. Cooley for
not letting them use a videotape recorder.
   The 15-year-old boys sprayed Cooley with insecticide and forced
him to drink charcoal lighter fluid while he screamed for his life,
authorities said. A deputy coroner said Cooley was suffocated with
a bag.
   As Judge Arthur O. Fisher of Juvenile Court read the verdict in
the non-jury trial, the two girls sat almost motionless, and one
mouthed a curse. The other clutched a stuffed bear and sobbed
lightly as she was led away.
   They were also found guilty of grand theft for helping steal
Cooley's stereo and videotape recorder.
   The girls, whose identities were not released because of their
age, were being held in a youth detention center.
   The judge could order them held for a year, and state officials
then could decide whether to hold them until age 21, siad assistant
prosecutor Debra Armanini. No sentencing date was set.
   The judge said the girls helped the two boys get into Cooley's
apartment while his father was at work, knowing the boys intended
to beat Cooley and steal several electronic items.
   Prosecutors are seeking to have the two 15-year-olds tried as
adults on charges including aggravated murder and aggravated
robbery.
   Defense attorneys argued the girls did not know Cooley was to
die. But the judge said even if the girls had warned Cooley, as
they testified, they still were guilty for not trying to prevent
the attack.
   A 13-year-old accomplice has pleaded guilty to involuntary
manslaughter and theft and awaits sentencing. The defense at the
girls' trial contended the 13-year-old kept the girls in a back
room while the older boys did the killing.
   ``I think the verdict sends a message across this city that the
courts are not going to permit anyone, no matter what their age, to
take part in a scheme or plan to snuff out another life,'' said
assistant prosecutor Mathias Heck Jr.

   Col. Jean-Claude Paul is a
household name in the capital Port-au-Prince, but one that few
people are comfortable speaking out loud.
   Paul was indicted Wednesday on drug trafficking charges in U.S.
District Court in Miami, but many radio stations in the Haitian
capital chose not to broadcast the news. Of those that did, only
one, the Roman Catholic station Radio Soleil, identified Paul by
name.
   ``We're not yet going to announce the news ... for security
reasons,'' a reporter at the independent station Radio Metropole
said Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``We've already
received threats. We'll announce the news when it's formally made
public.''
   Paul has been prominent in the impoverished Caribbean nation of
6 million since he was promote to colonel and given command of the
700-man Dessalines Battalion in January 1986.
   The battalion, quartered in a low-slung, mustard colored
building adjacent to the National Palace, was involved in almost
every incident last summer in which soldiers broke up peaceful
anti-government demonstrations. More than 30 people were killed and
200 wounded.
   Opposition leaders blame the battalion for standing by idly Nov.
29 while gunmen in the capital killed at least 34 people, forcing
the cancellation of what would have been Haiti's first free
presidential vote in 30 years.
   Paul refused requests to be interviewed at that time. His
colleagues and superiors have publicly defended and shielded him.
   Leslie Manigat was elected president Jan. 17 in balloting
boycotted by the opposition and marked by widespread irregularities.
   A communique three weeks ago by army Chief of Staff Gen. Carl
Nicolas rebutted the ``so-called involvement of (Paul) in affairs
of drug trafficking.''
   Col. Gary Leon, a spokesman for the military, refused a request
Thursday by The Associated Press for biographical information on
Paul.
   Nevertheless, a sketchy picture of Paul emerged from interviews
with acquaintances, colleagues and foreign observers, most of whom
spoke on condition their names not be used.
   Paul was born in 1938 to a family that supported dictator
Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier.
   His father was a high-ranking member of the Tontons Macoute
private militia. It was organized by Duvalier to throttle political
opposition and challenge the power of the army, which launched
several coups against Duvalier after his election in 1957.
   Paul's brother Alexandre was Haiti's consul general to the
Bahamas and the United States, based in Miami, until the Duvalier
family dictatorship ended in February 1986 with the flight of
Jean-Claude Duvalier to France following popular demonstrations.
   As a young officer, Paul was a protege of Francois Duvalier's
finance minister, Clovis Desinor. He rose through the ranks during
the 1970s and served with the elite Leopards counterinsurgency
squad before taking command of the Dessalines Battalion.
   Rumors of Paul's alleged involvement with cocaine trafficking
surfaced in March 1987 when his ex-wife, Marie Merielle Delinois,
was arrested in Miami on drug charges. She pleaded innocent, was
released on $250,000 bond and promptly fled.
   Paul and his brother Antonio face three drug counts _ conspiracy
to distribute, distribution and attempted importation of cocaine
into the United States. They could face up to 45 years in prison
and $375,000 in fines if they are convicted. Ms. Delinois was also
indicted.
   ``Jean-Claude Paul's activity in cocaine smuggling is well
known,'' said one Western diplomat in a recent interview. ``He has
a landing strip near Thomozeau,'' a village about 90 miles
northeast of the capital near Haiti's border with the Dominican
Republic.
   Raymond Joseph, publisher of the Brooklyn, N.Y.-based newspaper
``Haiti Observateur,'' said the colonel has several houses in and
around the capital, in addition to a cattle ranch in Thomozeau.
   Paul, a short, stocky man who customarily wears a ring, bracelet
and necklace of heavy gold, lives above his salary of $1,800 a
month, said Joseph.
   The mission of Dessalines Battalion is to help police provide
order in the capital. Paul is seen most frequently in public
providing security for top government officials.
   The Western diplomat said Paul is popular with his troops and
pays them extra from his own pocket.
   ``He (Paul) ignores the chain of command,'' said the diplomat,
who added that Paul incorporated about 100 Tontons Macoutes into
his battalion and helped others flee Haiti at the end of the
Duvalier dictatorship.
   ``He is capable of making a coup d'etat,'' the diplomat said.

   Howard Stern, a radio personality known for his
outrageous, innuendo-laced broadcasts, is the target of a federal
investigation begun after he bragged on the air about getting drugs
for someone, according to a published report.
   The New York Daily News on Wednesday said it learned of the
investigation from a letter to the newspaper from Michael Levine, a
Drug Enforcement Administration agent.
   Levine said Stern, who has come under fire from the Federal
Communications Commission for his broadcasts, bragged on his
morning radio show Monday of getting drugs for an unidentified
guest on his cable TV special ``Howard Stern's Underpants and
Negligee Party,'' shown Feb. 27.
   ``Maybe somebody should have warned him (Stern) that he was
admitting to the commission of a federal and state felony,'' Levine
said.
   The Daily News, citing unidentified sources, said that DEA
agents had taken the unusual step of clearing the investigation
with the U.S. attorney's office. Because of Stern's habit of making
outrageous statements on radio, investigators wanted to know if the
office would press charges, the newspaper said.
   Robert Stutman, head of the New York DEA office, said Levine's
letter was written without his office's knowledge. He declined
comment on any investigation.
   Stern, whose morning radio program is heard on WXRK-FM in New
York and on WYSP-FM in Philadelphia, could not be reached for
comment. A message left at the New York station was not immediately
returned Thursday.
   Stern's radio broadcasts are filled with veiled and obvious
references to sex and other bodily functions. He testified at an
FCC hearing in April, and the commission warned him to avoid
certain sexual innuendoes and double entenderes.
   The FCC said Stern's broadcasts ``dwelt on sexual and excretory
matters in a pandering and titillating fashion that was patently
offensive as measured by contemporary community standards.''
   But because the FCC's own standards for decency may have been
unclear, the commission said it was forced to limit its sanction
against Stern to a warning.

   A 15-year-old boy who beat a classmate to
death with a baseball bat to find out what it was like to kill
someone was convicted of second-degree murder Thursday and
sentenced to life in prison.
   Rod Matthews, who was 14 when he lured Shaun Ouillette into the
woods with a promise of fireworks, showed no emotion when the
verdict was announced. He had been expressionless throughout the
weeklong trial, sitting with his eyes downcast.
   Matthews will be eligible for parole in 15 years.
   Carrying a portrait of her son and choking back tears, Jeanne
Quinn, the victim's mother, said she had hoped Matthews would not
be eligible for parole, which would have been the case if he had
been convicted of first-degree murder.
   ``He planned this. I'm sorry. Fifteen years. No, I'm sorry,
that's wrong,'' said Mrs. Quinn. ``Shaun is not coming home in 15
years, is he? He's not ever coming home.''
   The trial in this suburb 15 miles south of Boston was
highlighted by graphic descriptions of the slaying and testimony
from two young people who described how Matthews plotted the
killing and then took them to see the bludgeoned body in the woods
in Canton.
   Matthews' family, including two sisters and a brother, was
escorted out of court by officers shielding them from journalists.
Kenneth Matthews, the father, said he felt his son belonged in a
treatment facility rather than in prison.
   Matthews becomes the youngest of more than 6,500 inmates in the
state's prisons, possibly the youngest ever, said Correction
Department spokeswoman Mary McGeown.
   ``It's terrible,'' said Matthews' mother, Janice. ``A child
shouldn't be persecuted and forced to go through something like
this. They're children. God only knows how much worse it's going to
make his condition.''
   Defense attorney John Philip White had argued that Matthews
should be acquitted by reason of insanity. He portrayed him as a
mentally unstable child whose pleas for help were ignored by
teachers and friends, and as someone adversely affected by taking
the drug Ritalin to control hyeractivity.
   White said after the verdict that he was concerned about
Matthews' safety at the adult prison at Walpole and about ``the
suicidal ideation he has shown.''
   Norfolk County Superior Court Judge Roger J. Donahue said
defense attorneys could appeal the verdict within 30 days. Donahue
rejected a defense motion to reconsider the sentence and classify
Matthews as a juvenile.
   The jurors had deliberated for nearly 10 hours over two days
before making their decision.
   Norfolk County Assistant District Attorney Peter Casey called
the decision an ``appropriate, well-counseled verdict.''
   The widely publicized case was compared to the trial of Anthony
Broussard, 18, sentenced to 25 years to life in 1982 in San Jose,
Calif., for killing his girlfriend. Broussard took at least 13
schoolmates to see the victim's body and the movie ``The River's
Edge'' was based on that case.
   Two child behavior specialists testified that Matthews did not
experience classic symptoms of psychosis and that continued use of
Ritalin could not have triggered violent behavior.
   But a doctor said Monday that Matthews' irrational conduct may
have been exacerbated by the drug, which Matthews had been taking
since the third grade.
   Two friends of Matthews', Rob Peterson and Jonathan Cash,
testified earlier this week that Matthews told them of his desire
to kill in the fall of 1986. They said two potential victims were
mentioned and rejected before Matthews decided on Ouillette.
   No charges were filed against Peterson and Cash.
   Matthews chose Ouillette because he felt he would not be missed,
the teen-agers said. Ouillette, 14, was relatively new to Canton,
his family having moved there two years before the slaying.
   Witnesses said Matthews befriended Ouillette before he lured him
to the wooded area after school on Nov. 20, 1986. He hit Ouillette
on the head with a baseball bat at least three times. Matthews
recalled Ouillette cried for help, the friends testified.
   Matthews took Peterson to see the body several hours after the
slaying and they hid a knife Matthews planned to use to cut off
Ouillette's arms and legs.
   Several days later, Peterson and Cash went with Matthews to see
the body after a pre-Thanksgiving pep rally at Canton High School.
   Police found the body on Dec. 15, 1986, after receiving an
anonymous letter sent by Cash.
   Matthews told a psychiatric counselor after the slaying that he
first decided to kill someone after viewing the videotape ``Faces
of Death,'' which depicts animal and human deaths.

   About 200 students from the National
Technical Institute for the Deaf rallied Thursday in support of
demands by students at Washington's Gallaudet University for a
hearing-impaired president.
   ``We will keep the spirit. The spirit shall never die,'' said
Scot Atkins, a spokesman for the NTID students. ``It's time for a
deaf president at Gallaudet.''
   The protests came in response to the appointment of Elisabeth
Ann Zinser, who can hear, as president of Gallaudet. The nation's
only liberal arts college for the deaf has not had a
hearing-impaired president in its its 124-year history.
   Gallaudet students have said Zinser is not welcome on campus,
and they have called for the resignation of Jane Bassett Spilman,
chairwoman of the school's board of trustees.
   At NTID, students carried signs with slogans such as ``It Ain't
Over Till the Hearing Ladies Quit'' and ``Deaf People Have Been
Ready To Function Forever,'' and chanted, signed and waved their
arms over their heads.
   ``Deaf people can be president. We can do anything we want. And
the idea that we can't is just nonsense,'' said student Linda
Whitmore, through an interpreter. ``I plan to work with hearing
people when I graduate.''
   NTID, with an enrollment of 1,250, is a part of Rochester
Institute of Technology and offers two-year programs in such fields
as business, computers, engineering and architecture.
   Some of the students go on to Gallaudet or to RIT, said NTID
spokesman Vince Dollard.
   Two busloads of students and numerous cars with a total of about
150 people were scheduled to leave the campus at midnight for a
rally Friday in Washington.
   Atkins said Thursday's rally and the support for Gallaudet's
students has nothing to do with NTID, whose director and president
both can hear.
   ``They've been very good to us and we've been very good to them
and we have no problem with the way things are here,'' he said.

<HEAD>Armenian Groups Claim 1,500 Armenians Killed in Azerbaijan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Armenian nationalists claimed Wednesday
that ethnic clashes in the southern Soviet republic of Azerbaijan
killed more than 1,500 Armenians.
   The Armenian Revolutionary Federation made the claim in
statements issued by its headquarters in Athens and an office in
Nicosia. There was no way to verify the report.
   Soviet officials have said 32 people died in the unrest last
week, but Armenian nationalists in Moscow have said the toll was
much higher. Foreign correspondents have not been allowed to travel
to the region.
   ``The violence against the Armenian population has reached the
scale of a massacre,'' said the group.
   The federation said more than 1,500 Armenians have been
confirmed dead as a result of ``mob attacks.''
   Tension between Armenians and residents of Azerbaijan erupted in
violence Feb. 28 in the Azerbaijan city of Sumgait. The unrest was
triggered by Armenian demands that Nagorno-Karabakh, a
predominantly Armenian region in Azerbaijan, be annexed to
neighboring Armenia.
   Simom Ainedjian, spokesman for the Armenian group in Nicosia,
told the AP the group's sources were contacts in Armenia. The
statement from Athens cited reports from sources in Moscow,
Karabakh and the Armenian capital of Yerevan.
   The statement said Moslem Azeris, natives of Azerbaijan,
attacked the Christian Armenians in Sumgait. It said the Azeris
blew up many Armenian buildings ``with the result that the tenants
were buried in the ruins.''
   A group affiliated with the federation, the Armenian National
Committee, also said in Athens Wednesday that more than 1,500
people were killed in the clashes.
   A spokesman for the committee identified its source as Armen
Sahakian, an Armenian dissident living in Moscow.
   ``We've had similar information from other dissidents and in
telephone calls with people living in Yerevan, but he is our main
source,'' the spokesman, Jirayr Beudjian, told The Associated Press.
   Beudjian said Sahakian had met with people that fled to Moscow
from the two republics.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev met with the leaders of
Armenia and Azerbaijan in Moscow Wednesday to discuss the ethnic
unrest.

<HEAD>Screwdriver Connection: Seagram Buying Tropicana</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seagram Co. said Thursday it is buying the makers
of Tropicana orange juice in a $1.2 billion transaction dubbed the
``screwdriver deal.''
   ``We have already broadened our base with Seagram's (wine)
coolers, and Tropicana is another step in this direction,''
Chairman Edgar M. Bronfman said in announcing the purchase of
Tropicana Products from Beatrice U.S. Food Corp.
   The deal will be financed initially with a combination of bank
loans and short-term borrowings, said the Canadian liquor and
beverage giant.
   Market watchers jokingly called the sale the ``screwdriver
deal'' in a reference to the popular cocktail made of vodka and
orange juice.
   Montreal-based Seagram is best known for its distilled spirits
and wines but in recent years has moved into the manufacturing of
wine coolers and sells cocktail mixers such as tonic, seltzer and
ginger ale under the Seagram's name.
   Seagram is also acquiring French cognac producer Martell & Co.
   Securities analysts said the move into the orange juice business
was a logical step for Seagram.
   ``They understand the business, and it's growing, unlike most of
their liquor products,'' said Ian Osler, an analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities in Toronto.
   However, the New York credit-rating firm Standard & Poor's Corp.
said the pending sale had negative debt implications for both
Seagram and Beatrice.
   S&P said the deal would reduce Seagram's dependence on distilled
spirits but increase the company's debt load, raising questions
about Seagram's ability to absorb both Tropicana and Martell.
   Tropicana, with headquarters in Bradenton, Fla., had sales of
about $750 million in its last fiscal year, which ended Feb. 29,
said Marcelline Thomson, a Seagram spokeswoman.
   Seagram earned nearly $423.5 billion on sales of $3.3 billion in
the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 1987, and reported a profit of more
than $402.4 million on sales of $2.6 billion for the nine months
ending Oct. 31, Ms. Thomson said.
   Beatrice U.S. Food Corp., based in Chicago, is a division of
Beatrice Co., whose holdings include Hunt's tomato products, Wesson
oil, Swift-Ekrich Inc. meats, Peter Pan peanut butter and Orville
Redenbacher popcorn.

   An avalanche roared down on Prince
Charles's skiing party Thursday, killing a close friend. The future
British king was unhurt, but a witness said he trembled and wept as
a rescue helicopter arrived.
   Swiss officials had warned earlier Thursday of possible
avalanches in the area.
   The dead skier was identified as Maj. Hugh Lindsay, 34, a former
aide to Queen Elizabeth II, the prince's mother. Buckingham Palace
said another skiier, Patricia Palmer-Tomkinson, suffered leg
injuries.
   Press Association, the British domestic news agency, said
Charles helped dig the victims out of the snow.
   Charles was not injured, and his wife Diana and pregnant
sister-in-law the Duchess of York were safe in a chalet at the time
of the avalanche, said the palace statement issued in London.
   There were calls in Britain for members of the royal family to
take more care. Press Association said the Dutchess of York, the
wife of Charles's younger brother Prince Andrew, had a fall earlier
in the day from which she emerged wet and shaken. She was told to
spend the afternoon resting.
   Prince Andrew was not on the ski trip.
   Queen Elizabeth and her husband, Prince Philip, were attending
an official engagement in London when informed of the avalanche.
The queen later talked to Charles, 39, at the Alpine chalet where
the royal party had stayed since arriving Tuesday.
   Witnesses on the mountain said Charles, the Prince of Wales and
heir to the throne, looked distraught after the avalanche buried
two of the six people in his party. One said he was weeping and
shaking when the helicopter came.
   Buckingham Palace said Charles and the others were off the main
ski trails near an extremely steep run, and were stationary when
the snow began to move.
   Charles has vacationed in the Klosters ski area for years, knows
it well and is considered good on the slopes.
   The party, including a guide, was on Mount Gotschnawang when the
snow rushed down from about 100 yards above at 2:50 p.m., said
officials of the Grisons canton, or state.
   Lindsay and Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson were flown to a hospital in
Davos, the officials said.
   According to the palace statement, ``All members of the party
were in a position to take avoiding action with the exception of
Maj. Lindsay and Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson who were both caught in the
avalanche.''
   Another statement Thursday night said: ``The Prince of Wales and
the whole party are naturally extremely distressed by this tragic
accident which resulted in the death of their close friend Maj.
Hugh Lindsay and serious injury to Mrs. Patti Palmer-Tomkinson.''
   Hanspeter Kirchhofer, an investigating magistrate in Davos, said
Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson was being treated for fractures of both legs
and was ``doing well under the circumstances.''
   The Gotschnawang station on the cable car, which skiiers ride up
the mountain, is at 7,540 feet and the prince's party had skied
down to about 5,800. The Swiss Federal Avalanche Research Institute
had warned of considerable avalanche danger above 5,200 feet in
northern Grisons.
   Lindsay was the 12th snowslide victim of the winter in
Switzerland.
   Earlier Thursday, a Polish mountain climber was killed on the
north wall of Mount Eiger, about 95 miles to the southwest.
   Charles, Diana and the Duchess of York posed for photographers
Wednesday at Klosters. The 28-year-old duchess, the former Sarah
Ferguson, is expecting her first baby in August.
   Lindsay was a close friend of Charles and Diana, who attended
his wedding last July. He frequently accompanied them on their
annual ski holiday at Klosters.
   Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson and her husband, Charles, also vacation
with the royal couple at Klosters.
   Harold Brooks-Baker, publisher of the Burke's Peerage directory
of the aristocracy, said his representative in Switzerland told him
the royal party was warned of the avalanche danger.
   ``We have constantly suggested to the royal family that they be
more prudent,'' he told a reporter. ``They constantly act as though
nothing can harm them. ... After all, these people don't belong
just to families but to the world.''
   Charles had a spectacular crash on Gotschnawang in 1979, landing
on his hip and escaping unhurt.

   Gov. Evan Mecham's last chief of staff
testified Thursday that he would not have responded as the governor
did to reports that another official threatened a former Mecham
aide who was a grand jury witness.
   But Richard Burke, a former U.S. attorney and Justice Deparment
official who was the first defense witness at Mecham's impeachment
trial, refused to say whether he thought the governor obstructed
the investigation of the alleged threat.
   ``I don't think I should comment on that,'' Burke said, as
members of the Arizona Senate pressed him for a legal opinion. ``I
think the governor would have a very different view of that than I
would.''
   Mecham, 63, is accused of obstructing justice by telling the
state's top police official not to give the attorney general
information about the alleged threat.
   He also is accused of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan and
misusing $80,000 from a state fund, but the Senate is hearing
testimony on the obstruction charge first.
   Mecham, who has not appeared at the impeachment trial since it
began Feb. 29, also faces a criminal trial April 21 on felony
charges of concealing the $350,000 and a recall election May 17.
   The first-term Republican is the first U.S. governor to be
impeached in six decades.
   Burke, who tried to reorganize the chaotic Mecham offices in the
two months before the governor's impeachment, said he believed that
the reported threat was serious and that Mecham should have fired
the accused aide, Lee Watkins, much earlier than he did.
   ``I certainly took it as a serious threat,'' said Burke. ``It
wasn't a threat of tiddlywinks. I think all of us assumed it was a
crime or a potential crime or it wouldn't have been reported to
us.''
   According to testimony in the impeachment trial, Mecham first
was told Nov. 13 that Watkins threatened former Mecham adviser
Donna Carlson, saying she might go ``on a long boat ride'' if she
talked to a grand jury investigating finances of Mecham's 1986
campaign.
   Watkins has denied threatening Ms. Carlson. Last week he refused
to testify when called as a prosecution witness.
   Ralph Milstead, director of the Department of Public Safety,
said he was told Nov. 15 by Mecham to refuse any request for
information by the attorney general. He has said he did cooperate,
however.
   Mecham has testified in House impeachment hearings that he may
have told Milstead not to cooperate with the attorney general.
   In other developments, a secretary to Peggy Griffith, the
official who first reported the alleged death threat, said that her
boss often exaggerated things and that she questioned Mrs.
Griffith's version of what occurred.
   But when senators asked her for examples of exaggerations, the
secretary, Terri Elaine Fields, paused and said, ``I can't even
think of any right now.''
   Under questioning by Mecham attorney Fred Craft, Burke said the
governor was ill-served by his subordinates because they did not
give him complete information on the alleged threat quickly enough.
   But on cross-examination, House prosecutor William French honed
in on Mecham's exact instructions to Milstead: ``Would you say
this: `Don't tell the attorney general anything?'''
   ``No,'' said Burke.
   ``Would you say this to Col. Milstead: `Never. Don't give him
any help?''
   ``No,'' said Burke.
   Burke, in apparent agreement with a number of prosecution
witnesses, said political loyalty impelled the governor to ignore
staff warnings and support Watkins.
   ``Why was Mr. Watkins not let go at an earlier date?'' asked
Democratic Sen. Lela Alston.
   Burke replied that Mecham ignored nearly unanimous advice from
his staff to fire Watkins.
   ``I think the governor felt a great deal of loyalty to Mr.
Watkins,'' said the witness, ``because Mr. Watkins hd been very
active and supportive of his campaign.''
   Prosecution witnesses have suggested Watkins won favor by
raising money for Mecham's campaign. They said Watkins told of
being rewarded with a state job and intimated he had information
which could bring down the Mecham administration.
   A two-thirds vote in the Senate is required to convict Mecham on
impeachment charges and remove him from office. Senators then could
take another vote and forbid him from holding state office again.

<TEXT>
   A Swiss tycoon involved in a plan to build
an Iraqi oil pipeline attended an event Thursday with Shimon Peres,
whom he allegedly tried to bribe into guaranteeing the line's
safety.
   Bruce Rappaport joined the foreign minister at a Haifa
University symposium on heart disease, which Rappaport financed. He
denied offering Peres a bribe and said he would ``tell all at the
appropriate time and place'' about the $1 billion pipeline project.
   Peres angrily brushed aside questions about the pipeline case,
which also has been linked to Edwin Meese III, the U.S. attorney
general.
   ``My name is not connected with anything and I don't want you to
connect it,'' Peres said, interrupting a reporter. ``Did anyone say
they gave me anything? Did anyone say they promised me anything?
Please, a little fairness.''
   Rappaport told reporters Israel lost $60-$70 million because the
project was not built _ the sum it was to receive for promising not
to bomb the line.
   He said Peres, then prime minister, gave the guarantee after
consulting Yitzhak Shamir, who then was foreign minister, and two
other Cabinet ministers.
   ``There was never a question of giving this sum to ministers or
a political party and the only one who would have benefited from
the deal would have been the Israeli treasury,'' the Israeli news
agency Itim quoted Rappaport as saying.
   In Washington, independent counsel James McKay is investigating
whether Meese violated a law that prohibits payment of bribes to
foreign officials by U.S. companies and authorizes the attorney
general to intervene to block them.
   The investigation stems from a 1985 memo to Meese from his
longime friend E. Robert Wallach, who had been hired as legal
counsel by Rappaport to help secure U.S. support for the pipeline
project.
   Wallach's memo says payments were planned to the Israeli Labor
Party, which Peres leads, in connection with the pipeline. Meese
has said he does not recall reading the portion that mentioned
payments to the party.

   A treaty requiring nations to prosecute or extradite
terrorists who commit acts of violence on the high seas was signed
by 23 countries Thursday, including the United States.
   Agreement comes more than two years after Palestinian terrorists
hijacked the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro and killed an
American passenger.
   Representatives from 53 other nations, including the Soviet
Union, Israel, Egypt and Libya expressed approval of the document,
the first maritime convention against terrorism.
   ``I have a very vivid memory of the Achille Lauro and I can only
feel the deepest emotion today,'' said U.S. Ambassador Maxwell
Rabb, who signed for the United States. ``This document corrects a
tremendous void in the law of terrorism.''
   The treaty still must be formally ratified by the governments
that signed.
   A U.S. government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said he expected most of the 53 other countries would sign within a
year. He said many representatives wanted their governments to
review the treaty before signing.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization sent observers to the
treaty conference.
   The treaty requires ratifying countries to make it a crime to
commit violent acts against ships or the people aboard them. It
also covers oil rigs or platforms anchored to the bottom of the sea
and the people aboard them.
   The countries agree to either prosecute or extradite terrorists
who commit violent acts at sea. A country whose citizens are
victims of an attack can seek extradition of the terrorists.
   The treaty was the final document of a 10-day conference of
diplomats and international law specialists convened by the
London-based International Maritime Organization, an agency of the
United Nations.
   Italy, Egypt and Austria requested the convening of such a
conference in 1986, following the Achille Lauro hijacking. The ship
was seized off Egypt and many passengers were Austrian.
   The U.S. government official said the treaty ``clarifies which
countries have the criminal jurisdiction to prosecute people who
commit acts of violence on vessels outside their territorial
waters.''
   He said it fills ``a gap in international anti-terrorist law.''
   In October 1985, four Palestinian terrorists hijacked the
Achille Lauro, killing Leon Klinghoffer, a 69-year-old passenger
from New York confined to a wheelchair. At the time, the United
States accused Italy of releasing Mohammed Abbas, the accused
mastermind of the hijacking who was later convicted in absentia by
an Italian court of the murder.

   President Reagan said Thursday the
reunification of Germany could result from efforts to resolve
East-West differences over Berlin's divided status.
   Reagan spoke in an interview with the Washington correspondent
of ZDF television, which broadcast excerpts on its evening newscast.
   The U.S. president repeated a suggestion that the Olympic Games
be held in both halves of divided Berlin. He also said he hoped
Berlin could become an international meeting place and an air
traffic transportation center.
   Reagan was asked about the possibility of a future reunification
of the two Germanys as a consequence of improved East-West dialogue.
   ``Maybe out of these things (talks about Berlin's status)
reunification could grow,'' Reagan replied.
   The president said holding the Olympic Games in Berlin would be
an ``important contribution toward peaceful development between
East and West.''
   Reagan first suggested the Games be held in Berlin during a
visit to the city last year.
   Reagan said the Berlin Wall would continue to be an important
issue in talks with Soviet officials.
   The German state was divided into communist East Germany and
pro-Western West Germany following the defeat of Adolf Hitler's
Third Reich in World War II.

   A tobacco-company representative who
telephoned jurors during a $17 million liability suit against the
makers of Pall Mall cigarettes did not break the law, a district
attorney said Thursday.
   ``We're not sure of the specifics of the calls but in essence it
was simply a case of trying to be friendly or trying to help _ even
being a bit nosy,'' Frank Carlton said in detailing the findings of
a state investigation.
   The investigation followed January's trial of a suit brought
against American Brands Inc. by the family of Nathan Henry Horton,
who died of lung cancer after smoking two packs a day of unfiltered
Pall Malls for more than 30 years.
   A mistrial was declared in the case when jurors couldn't agree
on a verdict.
   Allegations of attempted jury tampering later surfaced, and
Norman Clark, a jury consultant for the defense, said he had called
jurors at one point to inform them that the judge was sick and that
the day's session had been called off.
   ``What occurred was improper but being improper is not a
crime,'' Carlton said.
   ``The truth is there is not supposed to be contact with jurors
during trial for any reason. Even innocent contact can be
misconstrued, as it was in this case.''

   Dirt collapsed in a gully where three
boys were digging a hole, burying the youngsters and killing two
despite neighbors' efforts to save them, police said. The third boy
dug himself out.
   Joel Rogers and Damon Deakin, both 13, died Wednesday evening,
said police spokesman Tony Herrera.
   Residents of the trailer park where the three lived saw the
teen-agers digging in the gully then saw a cloud of dust, Herrera
said.
   Neighbors who heard screams pulled Joel out and were trying to
revive him when officers arrived, Herrera said. Paramedics pulled
Damon out about 15 minutes later, he said.
   Damon was pronounced dead at the scene and Joel was pronounced
dead at University of New Mexico Hospital.
   One of the boys, 14, whose name was withheld, dug out and went
for help, Herrera said.
   Dave Wild, a resident of the trailer park, said he had warned
the boys of the danger of digging in the dry gully, or arroyo, but
they continued to play, and moments later he saw a cloud of dust.
   ``I didn't think anything of it,'' he said. ``Then I remembered
the kids digging. I ran out and one of them was yelling that the
other two were trapped inside. I jumped into the arroyo and started
digging.
   ``I kept digging until I got to a foot, then I reached his
head,'' he said. ``I pulled him out and he wasn't breathing.''
   Trailer park manager Kaylin Morris said she heard the boys
talking earlier Wednesday about digging a tunnel. ``The three were
inseparable,'' she said. ``It was just like the Three Musketeers.''

   Iraq and Iran said Thursday they would
stop rocketing each other's cities, but within hours both had
launched new missile attacks.
   Iraq fired three long-range missiles at Tehran on Thursday and
two into Qom. The Iraqi News Agency said the attacks brought to 51
the number of missiles fired at Tehran since Feb. 29.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Iranian
Revolutionary Guards fired two missiles into Baghdad. Iran has
reported firing 27 missiles into the Iraqi capital since Feb 29.
   There was confusion over the timing of a possible cease-fire.
   An Iraqi statement broadcast over Baghdad Radio and monitored in
Nicosia said the bombardment of Tehran and other Iranian cities
would halt by 4 p.m. Friday if the Iranians stopped firing at
Iraq's cities.
   Iranian Prime Minister Hussein Musavi said that Iran would halt
attacks on Iraqi cities if Iraq stopped attacking Iranian cities,
Tehran radio reported.
   Musavi said he was responding to a call by Turkish Prime
Minister Turgut Ozal, who asked Iran and Iraq to stop the ``war of
the cities'' by Thursday at 5 p.m.
   Ozal sent messages to Iran and Iraq on Wednesday asking them to
end the bombardments on population centers.
   Twenty diplomats and their families drove to Turkey on Wednesday
night after evacuating Tehran, the independent Turkish Hurriyet
news agency reported. It said the group included diplomats from
Norway, Finland, the Netherlands, Denmark, West Germany and Syria.
   Iraq claimed that Tehran triggered the latest round of the ``war
of the cities'' by hitting Baghdad with two missiles Feb. 29.
   ``So the last bombardment should be Iraq's before the cessation
goes into effect,'' the statement said. ``If the enemy Iranian
regime attacks any of our cities ... in retaliation for the last
Iraqi bombardment, we will continue attacking.''
   The statement came after a meeting of top Iraqi officials
chaired by President Saddam Hussein.
   Iranian envoy Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati told a news conference
at the United Nations that Iran would honor any unconditional truce
called for by Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar. He said
Iran would not fire back if Iraq got in the last shot before any
deadline set by Perez de Cuellar.
   ``We can respond to anyone _ but unconditionally,
unconditionally,'' he said.
   The U.N. chief did not respond to Mahallati's call. Sources
close to Perez de Cuellar said Iran also insisted he condemn Iraq
for starting the missile duel, something he was unwilling to do.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency said scores of civilians
were killed or wounded in the latest Iraqi missile attacks.
   ``In the event of a complete halt to the air and missile attacks
by the Iraqi regime, we too will stop these attacks,'' Musavi told
the state-run radio.
   ``But if the rulers of Iraq refrain from accepting this request
by Turkey, we will strengthen the intensity of our retaliatory
measures,'' he said in the broadcast, monitored by the British
Broadcasting Corp.
   Musavi said his nation was eager to defeat Iraq on the ground
and to end attacks on civilians.
   ``We believe that the war must take place chivalrously on the
battlefields and that extending the hostilities to residential
areas to victimize women and children signifies only the impotence
of the party that started such a crime,'' he said.
   The all-Swiss International Committee of the Red Cross called
the missile exchange a ``very grave violation'' of international
humanitarian law. A statement issued in Geneva said the ICRC made a
``solemn appeal'' to end what it called ``this tragic escalation''
of the war.
   The official Iraq News Agency said ``a number of civilians''
were killed Thursday in Iranian shelling.
   Iran said its warplanes attacked Basra and Al-Amarah farther
north.
   Cities in western or central Iran reported hit by Iraqi
warplanes on Thursday included Isfahan, Hamadan, Arak, Dezful,
Shustar, Shahr-E Kord and Burujerd. A mosque and a school were hit
in Isfahan, and two schools and a hospital were destroyed in
Shahr-Kord, Tehran radio said. Iraq reported its planes also raided
Khorramabad, Guilan-E-Gharb, and Sar-E-Pol-Zahab.

<HEAD>One Jury Convicts, Another Deliberates in Grisly Killing, Arson
Spree</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury Thursday convicted a man of murder
and arson in a grisly crime spree that left five people dead, a
verdict returned one day after a second jury in the rare ``dual
trial'' convicted a co-defendant.
   One jury was selected for each defendant at the trial to save
time and to prevent the possibility of publicity from one trial
tainting potential jurors for a second.
   Carl ``Butch'' Campbell, 28, and Robert Ahalt, 42, were accused
of beating three people to death in a bar in 1986 during a robbery,
then killing Campbell and Ahalt's girlfriends the next day in the
women's homes.
   One of the women, who was six months' pregnant, was sexually
mutilated and forced to eat glass before she and her fetus died.
The bar and the women's homes were set afire.
   It was only the second time in New York legal history that two
juries have been called on to listen to one case and give two
verdicts.
   During the trial, the defendants sat at the same table, but the
two juries sat on opposite sides of the courtroom, one in a
specially built jury box.
   The juries and evidence were color coded. The jury considering
Ahalt's case wore blue lapel tags, and Campbell's jury wore yellow
tags.
   Most testimony involved both cases, but when a witness was
providing information that involved only one defendant, the other
jury was taken from the room. The defendants testified in front of
their own jury only.
   Campbell, convicted Thursday, faces a sentence of 115 years to
life in prison. Ahalt could receive up to 125 years to life.
Sentencing was set for April 7.
   Each defendant was charged with three counts of arson, five of
intentional murder, five of murder during the commission of a
felony, in this case, robbery, and one of murder during a sexual
assault.
   Campbell was acquitted of a charge of murder during a robbery at
the home of one of the women and both murder counts in the slaying
of the woman at the other home. Ahalt was acquitted of murder
during a sexual assault.
   Attorneys for both men had objected to the dual juries and said
they would appeal the verdicts.
   State Supreme Court Justice Donald Mark had originally said that
the verdicts would have to be delivered at the same time.
   But four hours after the Ahalt jury reached its decision
Wednesday night, Campbell's attorney waived his client's right to
have the verdicts announced simultaneously.
   Killed at Dick's 43 Lounge were the bar's 75-year-old co-owner
Martha Gruttadauria; her sister-in-law Concetta Amatore, also 75,
and Colin Tuttle, 56, a patron.
   The next day, Dorreen Grachus, 28, and Evelyn Allen, 38, were
found slain in their homes a half-mile apart. Grachus, Campbell's
girlfriend, was pregnant. Allen, Ahalt's girlfriend, was beaten to
death, police said.
   Firefighters found all five bodies during fires.
   The first dual trial was held in 1984 in Nassau County and
involved two young men who were drag racing and were charged with
criminally negligent homicide when their cars slammed into another
car, killing the driver.
   That case has been appealed to the state's highest court,
largely because of the dual trial format, said Bruce Whitney, a
Nassau County assistant district attorney.

   A former minister left two telephone messages for
his wife the night she was choked nearly to death, describing his
whereabouts in keen detail and giving times, and warning her to
lock the garage door, according to tapes released Thursday.
   Walker Railey told police he found 39-year-old Margaret
``Peggy'' Railey unconscious on the floor of the garage at their
Lake Highlands home shortly after midnight last April 22, choked
with a cord. She remains in a coma.
   Railey, 40, senior pastor of the prominent United Methodist
Church of Dallas at the time of the attack, claimed his family was
the victim of a racially motivated attack. After a suicide attempt
and reported refusal to testify before a grand jury, he resigned
and moved to San Francisco, leaving his children, ages 2 and 5, and
wife in Texas.
   Railey has denied attacking his wife and vows he is innocent. He
has not been charged but his lawyer said he was a prime suspect,
and police hope to have Railey answer more questions.
   Prosecutors released the answering-machine messages for the
first time Thursday.
   ``If you want to, go ahead and lock the garage door and I'll
park out front,'' Railey said on the tape. ``It really doesn't
matter to me at this point. My concern is that you're safe.''
   One of the biggest discrepancies with the tapes is the time
element. In the first message, Railey told his wife he didn't have
his watch on but thought it was about 10:30 p.m.
   Telephone company records, however, indicate he placed the call
at 12:04 a.m., Dallas County Assistant District Attorney Norman
Kinne said Thursday.
   In the first message, which lasted more than 1{ minutes, Railey
told his wife twice to lock the door and described his step-by-step
trail conducting research at two Southern Methodist University
libraries.
   He explained that he had to leave one library when it closed and
was on his way to another, and later called to explain that he was
on his way home.
   ``I'm not calling on the private line because I know you're
already asleep,' he said in the message saying he was on his way
home, ``but in case you get up with the kids, I just wanted you to
know that I'm on my way home. It's 12:30. I'll be home by about
12:45. Love you, dear. Bye Bye.''
   After waffling on the time in his first message, Railey noted
without hesitation in the second that the time was 12:29 a.m., a
figure Kinne said was confirmed to the minute by telephone company
records.
   He told police he arrived home at 12:40 a.m. and found his wife
unconscious.
   Kinne initially refused to release the tapes, prompting ABC News
to file suit. The network's suit failed but Kinne he decided to
release the material after an appeals court ruled it was up to
local officials to decide the issue.
   The attack occurred after Railey appeared at an Easter service
in a bullet-proof vest, claiming racially motivated death threats
had been made against him and his family because of his pro-civil
rights stands.
   He produced typed letters that threatened his life, but police
traced them to a typewriter in his church. The day police were
scheduled to question him further, he attempted to commit suicide
and left a note saying demons were torturing him.
   Railey became less cooperative, eventually appearing before a
grand jury last July when he reportedly cited his 5th Amendment
rights against self-incrimination 43 times.
   Mrs. Railey's mother and legal guardian, Billie Jo Nicolai,
filed a civil suit accusing Railey of the crime. He has not yet
responded to that lawsuit and must do so by Monday.
   Railey moved to San Francisco late last year and signed a year's
lease for an apartment with Dallas psychologist Lucy Papillon.
   That apartment's telephone number is unlisted, and The
Associated Press could not reach him for comment Thursday.
   Ms. Papillon has reportedly told grand jurors that she and
Railey were having an affair and that he was with her at her home
during part of the evening when Mrs. Railey was attacked.
   Railey gave temporary legal custody of his children to a
minister at the church where Railey served.

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines Inc. was held in contempt of
court Thursday for taking steps to sell its Eastern Air Shuttle to
its parent company, Texas Air Corp., for $225 million.
   U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt ruled that the financially
troubled Miami-based airline had flouted his July 2, 1987
injunction directing Eastern to maintain the status quo under its
contract with a union that represents 12,000 employees of the
airline.
   The preliminary injunction was issued in an different case last
summer after the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO, challenged Eastern's plans to transfer
ground crews and baggage handlers to a new subsidiary called Air
Ground Services Inc.
   At the time, Pratt ruled the proposed transfer of 6,000 IAM
members to the new subsidiary could not take place unless Eastern
bargained with the union.
   In Thursday's opinion, Pratt said the Eastern's financial
troubles ``do not change the fact that it proposed a `spin off' of
the air shuttle ... in clear violation of our July 2, 1987 order,
which, whatever doubts Eastern had as to its meaning and
application, it made no attempt to have clarified or modified.''
   The judge noted that Eastern announced the deal a day after it
dropped its appeal of the preliminary injunction.
   Pratt scheduled a March 18 hearing to determine what sanctions
should be imposed against the airline.
   ``The court's order today sends a message to Texas Air that it
is not above the law and it too must comply with the Railway Labor
Act,'' the union said in a statement from its District 100
headquarters in Miami.
   An airline spokesman, Robin Matell, said: ``Eastern's view is
that the court's ruling is incorrect and we intend to file an
expedited appeal. ... We are confident the court will rule in our
favor.''
   Pratt agreed with the union's claim that steps taken last month
toward the sale of Eastern Air Shuttle _ which operates between
Boston, New York and Washington _ to Texas Air amounted to a change
in the status quo of the machinists' working conditions and
therefore violated the injunction.
   The sale was announced last month pending Federal Aviation
Administration approval, which is not expected for at least another
month.
   ``We find that the proposed `spin off' of Eastern's air shuttle
operations ... is not fundamentally different from the proposed
`spin off' of Eastern's fleet services employees to Air Ground
Services'' that was barred last summer, the judge said
   The judge also determined that the ``proposed transfer to Texas
Air significantly changes the working conditions of IAM members''
and is therefore a major dispute under the Railway Labor Act.
   The judge accepted the union's contention that spinning off the
air shuttle could undermine the machinists' bargaining position
with the company. If less than 50 percent of the spin off company's
employees opt to join the IAM, machinists who transferred to the
new subsidiary from Eastern would be without union representation,
the judge noted.
   ``Since Texas Air would be in control of the Air Shuttle
operations including its labor policy, it will control the
hiring,'' the judge said. ``It can thus manipulate the composition
of its employees and alone determine whether such employees will
qualify for union representation.''

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration Thursday appealed a
federal judge's order declaring unconstitutional regulations that
would have cut off federal funding to family planning clinics that
offer abortion counseling.
   The administration filed notice it was asking the 1st U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn the March 3 ruling. No date
was set for arguments.
   The ruling by U.S. District Judge Walter Jay Skinner was
announced the day the regulations were to take effect. In response,
the administration ordered Health and Human Services offices
nationwide not to enforce the regulations.
   The rules would have prevented federally funded family planning
programs from providing abortion counseling, abortion referrals,
and engaging in lobbying or legal action to increase availability
of abortions.
   If the clinic also performed abortions, it would have to
maintain separate facilities for those patients if it wanted to
continue to receive federal funding under a provision of the Public
Health Service Act of 1970.
   Skinner said the regulations violated a woman's rights to
privacy and to choose an abortion. ``Abortion referral and abortion
counseling are constitutionally protected speech under the First
Amendment,'' he said.
   About 5 million low- and moderate-income women receive services
at the 4,000 clinics nationwide that would have been affected by
the regulations announced in February by HHS Secretary Otis R.
Bowen.
   Federal judges in Colorado and New York had issued temporary
injunctions against the regulations but Skinner was the first to
rule on their constitutionality.
   He ruled on an injunction requested by the Massachusetts, the
National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association and 13
other local and national family planning groups.

   Diseases that now kill or cripple
millions of children probably will be wiped out by the end of the
century, a leading American health expert said Thursday.
   ``The news on child survival is very good,'' said Dr. William
Foege, head of the Task Force for Child Survival and former
director of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
   ``By the end of the century we hope that measles will be reduced
by 90 percent and that measle deaths, which are now over 2 million
a year, will be reduced by 95 percent.''
   Measles was just one aspect of the optimistic vision Foege
presented to some of the world's leading experts on children,
health and Third World development.
   Attending the meeting are Barber Conable, president of the World
Bank; James P. Grant, director of UNICEF, the U.N. Children's Fund;
Halfdan Mahler, head of the World Health Organization; leaders of
more than a dozen other international aid agencies, doctors and
health ministers from 11 developing countries.
   They will review a project that already is saving millions of
lives and plan other efforts for the remainder of the century.
   The three-day symposium, at a 16th-century former monastery on
the shores of Lake Annecy, is sponsored by the Task Force for Child
Survival, whose members are UNICEF, the World Health Organization,
the World Bank, the U.N. Development Program and the Rockefeller
Foundation.
   Since the early 1980s, the organizations have been working
together on an international campaign to immunize children against
polio, diphtheria, whooping cough, tuberculosis and tetanus. The
project, aimed particularly at developing countries, has been a
great success.
   Chinese officials said they believe 85 percent of China's 110
million children under age 7 will be vaccinated by the end of this
year.
   The number of the world's children vaccinated against the five
diseases has risen from 5 percent in 1974 to 50 percent today.
Experts attending the conference say predict virtually every child
in the world will be immunized by the early 1990s.
   ``In a little over a decade, a public health revolution has
quietly taken place,'' said Dr. Ralph H. Henderson, director of the
expanded WHO immunization program.
   He said the vaccination campaign against measles, neonatal
tetanus, tuberculosis and whooping cough is saving the lives of
more than 1 million children a year in poor countries. Another
200,000 children are being saved from the paralysis of polio,
Henderson said.
   Dr. Ken Warren of the Rockefeller Foundation called the project
``the single most remarkable example of international interagency
cooperation I've ever seen.''
   The Task Force took as its model a campaign against smallpox
begun in 1966. In October 1978, the world was declared free of the
disease.
   Henderson said eradication of polio in the Americas by 1990 is
achievable and Foege said experience gained in the next two years
in the Americas will allow the Task Force ``to set a reasonable
date for eliminating polio from the world.''
   Polio already has been overcome in the United States, although
cases sometimes are reported among immigrant groups.
   ``A world without polio would be a fitting gift from the 20th to
the 21st century,'' Henderson said.

<NOTE>EDs: New thruout with Dole statement</NOTE>

   Sen. Bob Dole said Thursday he would not drop
out of the Republican presidential race, but confirmed that he had
canceled all television advertising in advance of next Tuesday's
critical Illinois primary. He also ordered deep layoffs in his
campaign staff.
   Even as Dole issued a statement saying he was ``no dropout,''
campaign aides said Dole had discussed abandoning his presidential
bid. The Kansas senator's campaign was gravely weakened by Vice
President George Bush's sweep of 16 primaries on Super Tuesday.
   One aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Dole's
private polls showed Bush with a lead of between 15 and 20
percentage points in Illinois, reflecting a significant jump for
the vice president in the 48 hours since Bush's stunning showing in
this week's primries.
   An ABC News poll released Thursday night suggested Bush led Dole
in Illinois by a wide margin _ 58 percent to 31 percent.
   In his statement, Dole did not say explicitly whether he would
stay in the race if he lost Illinois next Tuesday. One aide said:
``I think it's clear to Dole that it's do or die.''
   Several campaign sources said Dole met with campaign manager
Bill Brock and other aides over the last few days in Illinois and
discussed the possibility of quitting the race in the wake of
Bush's commanding lead in the race for national convention
delegates.
   But Dole decided to stay in.
   In his statement, issued in Washington and Illinois, Dole
``categorically denied rumors'' that he would quit.
   ``Bob Dole's no dropout. I'm in this one to win,'' he said.
   In his statement, Dole confirmed the sweeping staff cutbacks,
but said they were sparked by the fact that the campaign no longer
needed to run in so many states at once.
   Dole said no cuts were involved in states with primaries after
next Tuesday.
   Dole's statement also confirmed he had ordered his television
ads shut down in Illinois. But one source said the campaign may air
a 30-minute paid broadcast in the closing hours of the Illinois
campaign.
   In the meantime, Dole took another shot at Bush.
   He said if the vice president still refuses to meet him in a
series of one-on-one debates, they should agree to back-to-back,
live one-hour press conferences staged before the Illinois primary.
   ``The people of Illinois and America have a right to see where
George Bush and Bob Dole stand on the issues,'' he said in his
statement.
   Bush, campaigning in Illinois, was asked about the reports of
Dole considering withdrawal.
   ``I just heard that. I don't know anything about it,'' he told
reporters in Champaign, Ill.
   Bush's chief of staff Craig Fuller said the vice president was
aware of the reports that Dole was talking with aides abut whether
to continue his campaign. He said Bush's reaction was: ``We'll go
about our business, do our job.''
   Earlier, campaign spokeswoman Dale Tate said more than half the
Dole campaign's 300 staffers were being laid off. Many were still
getting the word Thursday evening.
   Dole continued campaigning Thursday in Illinois. At one point he
obliquely addressed the possibility of dropping out, saying: ``I've
been in this business long enough to know that there comes a time
you have to say, well, maybe it would happen.''
   Tate declined to say who among the national staff was being let
go.
   ``It is significant _ it ranges from the top to the bottom in
every department,'' she said of the cutback.
   Some of the layoffs had been planned for the period following
Super Tuesday, regardless of its outcome, she said. She said the
key members of Dole's traveling staff would be unaffected by the
cutbacks, naming press secretary Mari Maseng, adviser Thomas Rath,
campaign chairman William Brock and consultant Kim Wells.
   Tate said the campaign would keep ``a full complement'' of staff
in Illinois.
   The developments came the same day that Rep. Jack Kemp abandoned
his presidential bid. Kemp, after a round of fourth-place finishes
on Tuesday, called it quits at a Washington news conference. He did
not endorse any of his rivals.

   Palestinians rioted near
Jewish enclaves and Jews drove down Arab streets early Thursday
firing at houses and savaging cars, the army and witnesses said.
Soldiers wounded three Arabs.
   Troops shot and critically wounded two other Arabs in the
occupied Gaza Strip, hospital officials said.
   In a new leaflet issued Thursday, underground Palestinian strike
leaders told residents of the occupied territories to take revenge
on Jewish settlers, Palestinians who aid Israel and those who
sympathize with Jordan.
   Leaflet No. 10, signed by the PLO's United Leadership of the
Uprising, also ordered all Arab policemen to resign and told
Palestinian merchants to boycott Israeli products and reduce prices
charged to Arabs.
   Two alleged collaborators have been reported killed since Arab
riots began Dec. 8 in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel
captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. At
least 87 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli gunfire or
beatings, and hundreds have been wounded.
   Police detained Moussa and Ali Darwish, who were free pending
trial on charges of printing thousands of PLO leaflets in east
Jerusalem, Israel radio reported.
   Jews in Hebron, a city of 50,000 Arabs with two small Jewish
enclaves, said they were awakened shortly before midnight Wednesday
by Arabs shouting ``Slaughter the Jews!'' and ``God is Great!''
Some settlers said they rushed into the street and fired warning
shots because they feared attacks on their homes.
   Rabbi Moshe Levinger told The Associated Press the Arabs ``ran
down near the synagogue. They wanted to enter Jewish homes. We
responded by throwing stones and firing in the air. If we hadn't
stopped them ... there would have been a slaughter of Jews, men,
women and children.''
   Noam Arnon, another resident of the 40-family Beit Hadassah
complex where Levinger lives, said Arabs did not attack Jewish
homes.
   ``There was no damage to Jewish property,'' he said, adding that
he believed militants from the Kiryat Arba settlement outside
Hebron were responsible for damaging Arab property.
   The area military commander also disputed Levinger's claim.
   ``It's important to stress that the riots were directed at the
army and at no stage was there an intention or attempt to attack
Jewish homes,'' the commander, who did not give his name, said on
Israel radio.
   On May 2, 1980, Arab guerrillas fired on Jewish settlers
returning to Beit Hadassah after Friday evening prayers. Six
settlers were killed and 16 wounded by gunfire, grenades and
explosives in an ambush outside the building which had been
occupied by Jewish settlers from Kiryat Arba months earlier.
   Arab residents of Hebron said they were awakened early Thursday
by carloads of settlers raiding their neighborhoods.
   ``All the city was sleeping. There was nobody in the streets,''
said Mustafa Natsche, the former mayor.
   His cousin, Abdul-Rahman Natsche, said: ``Suddenly there was a
sort of battle under the windows of my house _ shooting, crying,
moaning. The settlers demolished the cars of Arabs and shot at the
windows of homes.''
   An AP reporter saw seven vandalized cars, including a station
wagon with all its windows smashed and another gutted by fire. The
cars were in four divergent locations, some more than a mile from
any Jewish settlement.
   The owner of the burned-out car, Khader Kafishei, reported
seeing a Jew set it ablaze and pointed to bullet holes in the
windows of his home.
   Arab residents showed several revolver cartridges they said were
collected after the raids and said they turned over hundreds of
casings to Israeli authorities as evidence.
   Levinger claimed 500 Arabs were rioting and came to within 100
yards of Jewish homes. He said about 50 settlers defended the homes.
   An AP reporter saw no apparent damage either to the stone facing
of Beit Hadassah, a former hospital, or the other Jewish enclave,
Tel Rumayda. Only a few hundred Jews live in Beit Hadassah and Tel
Rumayda.
   Army spokesmen said 20 to 30 Arabs were involved in each of
three disturbances in Hebron, and Jewish settlers set one Arab car
ablaze. Soldiers wounded three Palestinians in the legs when
rioters trapped their jeep, the army said.
   Soldiers surrounded the walled campus of Hebron University,
where dozens of students barricaded themselves inside for two
hours, chanting anti-Israeli slogans and waving posters demanding a
Palestinian state, witnesses said. The students dispersed
peacefully.
   At the Beach refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, soldiers shot and
wounded two Palestinians, hospital officials said. Both were in
critical condition with gunshot wounds in the chest and abdomen,
said the spokesmen at Gaza City's Shifa Hospital.

   Republican Bob Dole, clobbered by Vice President George Bush in
the Super Tuesday contests, cut back staff and television
advertising but insisted he was ``in this one to win,'' despite
polls putting him far behind in the Illinois primary race. Bush
said whatever happened, his campaign would ``go about our business,
do our job.''
   Bush, meanwhile, declared himself ``personally disturbed at the
breaches of ethics'' he'd seen in government, and said Thursday he
would set up a White House ethics panel if elected president.
   Dole pulled television commercials off the air in Illinois and
laid off more than half his staff Thursday. And a source said his
campaign advisers discussed whether Dole should suspend campaigning
before the Illinis primary on Tuesday.
   An ABC News-Washington Post poll, published in Friday's editions
of the Post, indicated Dole trailed Bush in Illinois, 58 percent to
31 percent.
   However, national campaign spokeswoman Dale Tate said Dole
intended to remain a candidate. ``We're not pulling the plug on the
campaign,'' she said.
   Later, Dole aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
possibility of dropping out was discussed, but the Kansas senator
would keep campaigning at least through Tuesday's Illinois contest.
   Dole issued a statment Thursday night denying he would withdraw.
``Bob Dole is no dropout,'' he said. ``I'm in this one to win.''
   The Dole developments came the same day that Bush's Super
Tuesday victories claimed another Republican _ Jack Kemp. And
Democrat Gary Hart was preparing to quit the Democratic race.
   Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, told reporters traveling
with the vice president that on hearing reports about Dole, Bush's
reaction was: ``We'll go about our business, do our job.''
   Democrat Richard Gephardt, who ran a poor fourth among Democrats
on Tuesday, said Michigan could decide his fate.
   Republican Pat Robertson, who finished a distant third to Bush
and Sen. Bob Dole in the Super Tuesday contests, said, ``Strange
things happen in politics, so I have no reason to get out.''
However, Robertson, campaigning in Chicago, said he planned to buy
no television ads in Illinois, which has its primary next Tuesday.
   He said he expected to pick up a bit of support from
conservatives who had backed Kemp.
   Bush flew to Illinois to press his campaign for the 82 GOP
delegates at stake in the state's primary. And he quickly took up a
new issue, saying he was ``tired of being embarrassed'' by scandals
surrounding public officials, though he named no names.
   Democrats Michael Dukakis, Jesse Jackson and Albert Gore Jr.
also campaigned in Illinois for a share of the 173 delegates at
stake in their party's primary there.
   Rep. Gephardt, D-Mo., who is focusing on Michigan, was joining
the other hopefuls in Chicago for a dinner and town meeting
Thursday night.
   Bush, speaking about what he would do if elected president,
promised to create the ethics panel and also to set up a deficit
summit with congressional leaders on ``day one'' of his
administration.
   ``When a congressman goes bad or someone in the executive branch
violates the public trust, it hurts,'' Bush told a Governor's Club
luncheon at the Chicago Hilton. ``I'm tired of being embarrassed.
I'm tired of seeing our children seeing things that should
embarrass us all. People at all levels of government should come to
serve, not to profit.''
   ``Clearly, I have big plans,'' he told the audience of
Republican boosters, who sat silently throughout the speech.
   Kemp withdrew from the GOP field after a string of third- and
fourth-place finishes in the early primaries and caucuses. But the
New York congressman hinted that he would be interested in the No.
2 spot on the ticket.
   ``Obviously you don't make plans to run for vice president,''
Kemp said at a Capitol Hill news conference. But he called the idea
``a very flattering and awesome thought. ... Would I think about
it? The answer to that is yes.''
   Kemp refused to endorse any of the remaining Republican
contenders. ``They're all Reagan conservatives,'' he said.
   The embattled Hart, who polled no more than 5 percent of the
vote in any of the Super Tuesday primaries and won no convention
delegates, planned to announce his withdrawal from the campaign at
a news conference on Friday in Denver, said sources who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The departure would mark the second time the one-time Democratic
front-runner had quit the 1988 race. Hart withdrew last May after
questions were raised about his relationship with model Donna Rice.
   Gephardt, who also faired poorly on Super Tuesday, issued an
ultimatum to his own campaign: Michigan or bust.
   ``If we don't do well here obviously we aren't going to be able
to continue in this race,'' the Missouri congressman said before a
rally in Lansing. ``Our real thrust, our real force is going to be
in Michigan,'' which has its caucus on March 26.
   The Gephardt campaign plans to shore up its forces in Michigan
with as many as 70 paid staffers, who are scheduled to arrive by
next week. In comparison, the campaign has about 20 paid staffers
in Illinois.
   Gephardt bristled at suggestions that his candidacy would suffer
the same fate as Kemp's.
   ``Unlike Jack Kemp, I have been in the middle of this race from
the beginning,'' he said. ``I have a delegate count that is within
striking distance of being back in the leadership.''
   Dole, who failed to capture any Super Tuesday states from Bush,
focused on the vice president's chances of winning in November
against any of the Democratic candidates.
   ``My view is it's going to be a very tough, tough race for
George Bush,'' Dole said in Chicago. ``He does not attract
Democrats or independents.''
   ``I would be a much stronger candidate. That's the message we're
going to try to make in the next couple of days,'' he said.
   Gore also questioned whether his party's front-runner,
Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis, could defeat the Republican nominee in
November.
   ``The people want a president who understands it's necessary to
fight for working men and women, not a technocratic manager,'' Gore
said as he greeted commuters at a downtown Chicago mass transit
stop. ``For those who want another election blowout and see the
Democratic party losing 49 of 50 states, vote for Mike Dukakis.''
   Jackson, who is expected to do well in Illinois, challenged
voters in Wheaton to continue his Super Tuesday success.
   ``A generation must dare to hope,'' Jackson told students at
Wheaton College. ``Super Tuesday has come and gone. We were No. 1
or No. 2 in 17 states. Lots of gold and silver medals. ... The
people responded.''
   Jackson and Dukakis were favored to pick up some of the 12
delegates at stake in Alaska, which held caucuses Thursday night.

   The stock market crash of last October
obliterated faith in the usual economic forecasting tools, leaving
forecasters thrashing about in the debris.
   They're still at it, wondering if the economic signals mean what
they used to mean. Does a red light mean ``stop,'' or could it
possibly mean ``go.''
   The usual tools and instruments, such as the Index of Leading
Economic Indicators, proved of little value in foretelling the
earthquake in securities markets, and so the question now is
whether they can be relied upon at all.
   Immediately after the crash almost every popular forecaster went
with his or her emotions and lowered estimates for economic
activity. It was a safe bet, they reasoned, because crashes always
led to recessions.
   The recession didn't come, however. Impossible to comprehend
then, and still hard to believe, so-called consumer confidence
appeared not to be as badly damaged as they had thought. People
still bought. Companies still hired.
   Gradually, the forecasters became brave again. Before the end of
the year the mass of them had raised their estimates again, not as
high as before but enough to push the likelihood of recession
further back into 1988.
   They were on safe ground, because such ``forecasts'' weren't
forecasts at all but recognition of what already had occurred. Car
sales were strong, people continued to take out credit and consumer
confidence had resumed rising.
   By January the evidence was sufficient for most of the breed to
stick their necks out and declare that the chances of recession
were growing remote. Still, they said, it would be a very dull
economy in 1988, with little expansion.
   No sooner had they braved the fates and showed their courage
than they were shocked again. Having recovered from their own
shock, economic historians declared in retrospect that the fourth
quarter had been stronger than realized.
   Now, the sturdy crew of forecasters was confronted with a
dilemma: If the economy was stronger than had been realized before,
perhaps it might be stronger in the future than had been forecast.
Who could be certain?
   Indeed, nobody could be certain. What could you believe? If you
couldn't believe the measurements of what had occurred in the past
you really couldn't understand the present and that left you
without a stick to measure the future.
   In such a predicament it is a wise forecaster who uses both
hands, one to point gamely to the future and the other to wave a
warning that ``if on the other hand ...'' It was a time for hedging.
   The hedge was this: The economy would grow, but sluggishly. The
consumer would spend, but cautiously. Couples would buy homes, but
carefully. Cars would sell, but slowly. Credit would expand, but
barely.
   Now the hedge needs clipping.
   There are signs the economy is expanding smartly, as indicated
by a surge in job creation and a jobless rate that fell in February
to just 5.7 percent, the lowest since July 1979. The use of credit
is strong. Car sales rose so sharply in late February that even
manufacturers and dealers were surprised.
   The evidence of economic strength piling up recently makes it
necessary for forecasters to forecast more often, just to keep
their revisions ahead of the event.
   Meanwhile, deep in the privacy of their own minds, it seems safe
to say, there is a gnawing uncertainty among economic forecasters
regarding their powers.
   Among the public, it seems just as safe to say, there is
conviction rather than uncertainty: They are certain that the
forecasters' uncertainty is fully justified.

   As he stripped and cleaned the AK-47
assault rifle on his desk, Federal Judge Miguel Angel Izaguirre
said he has good reason to try to stop Latin American cocaine from
reaching the streets of the United States.
   ``In 20 years, the youth that is taking all this cocaine will be
running America and influencing Latin America _ with the mentality
of cokeheads,'' he said. ``North America's influence in this region
is tremendous. So we Latin Americans have to try to ensure that
American youth does not take cocaine.''
   The 41-year-old Izaguirre is the federal judge in this Caribbean
coastal town. He also is a weapons buff and student of military
history.
   ``Men, like arms, are proven on the field of battle,'' he said
in an interview in his cramped and cluttered office that also
contained an Uzi submachine gun. ``And this is my field of battle.''
   He has survived two attempts on his life, he said _ one with an
incendiary bomb, the other a machine-gun attack on his home during
which he returned fire with his Soviet-made AK-47.
   ``I love the AK,'' he said. His arsenal of weapons, he
explained, is ``to defend myself against the Medellin Cartel.''
   The Medellin Cartel, named for the city in Colombia where it is
based, is believed responsible for more than 80 percent of the
cocaine smuggled into the United States.
   ``They have tried to bribe me with money, women, airplanes and
yachts,'' he said.
   Leaning against the wall were five segments of hollowed out
Honduran redwood ostensibly intended for assembly into rustic
doors. They are evidence from the biggest drug bust in U.S. history
_ the confiscation in November of four tons of cocaine by U.S.
federal agents in Florida. The drug, shipped from the northern
Honduran coast, was hidden in the hollows.
   ``According to our information, the shipment was 8,000 kilos
(almost 9 tons). So more than half of it got through,'' he said.
   U.S. authorities were greatly concerned when, over the past few
years, Honduras became an increasingly important transshipment
point for Colombian cocaine.
   Izaguirre has been cited as a key man in joint U.S.-Honduran
efforts to reduce the flow.
   The judge said Honduras, with its long and relatively unguarded
coast and scores of clandestine air strips, provided the ideal
midpoint for northbound shipments.
   ``When I came here in June 1987, I found a series of cases, all
of which were being dismissed for lack of evidence. ... Other
judges had certain fears, some got sick, some left,'' he said. But
within two months, he had handed down the first conviction and
prison term for cocaine trafficking in Honduran judicial history.
   He has convicted 10 others on drug charges, and has nearly three
dozen suspected traffickers in jail awaiting judgment. Two major
traffickers based here, the Colombian Luis Guerrero and the
Cuban-American Rafael Gonzalez, were extradited to the United
States after being arraigned by Izaguirre. They are both serving
terms in U.S. prisons.
   Izaguirre said he has given the maximum penalty under Honduran
law to all the drug traffickers he has convicted _ five years in
prison and a 5,000 lempira ($2,500) fine. He complains, however,
that the law is too lenient and would like to see penalties
increased. He said the law provides the same penalties for cocaine
trafficking as it does for marijuana trafficking.
   The judge _ divorced four times and the father of five children
_ carries his weapons with him wherever he goes.
   ``If it befalls me to die in this post, then I'll die, without
the slightest fear,'' he said.
   He keeps a .357 Magnun revolver on his desk within easy reach.
   The judge insists he has no political ambitions, but maintains
contact with a number of the country's political leaders.
   ``I tell them it is imperative that we verify the origin of the
parties' funds. Because if we don't, we're running the grave risk
that the traffickers get their people elected to Congress. Then
they reform the Constitution in their favor, they gut the
anti-narcotics law; they destroy us.''
   Though U.S. authorities have expressed concern that drug money
has corrupted some officers in Honduras' armed forces, Izaguirre
said the cooperation given him by the military has been ``total.''
   He said his interest in the military began when he was 12 years
old, with the reading of Karl von Clausewitz, the 19th century
Prussian general and writer of military strategy.
   ``I was two centimeters (about an inch) too short to get into
the military academy,'' he said. ``But if I had, I'm sure I would
have made general.''

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In hopes of making Greeks more familiar
with their ancestors' ideas, the education minister has ordered
high school students to start taking daily classes in ancient Greek
in September.
   The decision by Education Minister Antonis Tritsis was reached
after months of public debate by scholars and educators, but some
teachers claim the language used by Homer, Plato and the great
Greek dramatists might confuse young students and be too hard for
them to learn.
   ``Ancient Greek ideas should have a living medium in the world
today,'' Tritsis said in an interview, ``and I think that living
medium is the Greek people who continue to speak the same language
as the ancient Greeks.''
   He added that high school students 13 to 18 years old will be
the first to take compulsory ancient Greek, but that eventually
6-year-olds will start learning the language through word-games.
   ``We want every young Greek to be directly familiar with the
great wealth of his ancestors and those ancient Greek works that
have influenced the world,'' said Tritsis, an American-trained
architect.
   European literature began with Homer's poems about the legendary
Greek heroes of the Trojan War, the ``Iliad'' and the ``Odyssey.''
   Plays by Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides in the 5th century
B.C. are studied and performed in translation all over the world.
Plato's philosophic dialogues and Thucydides' histories contain
ideas that shaped Western thinking for centuries.
   Although Greek classical scholars and university professors say
they welcome Tritsis' project, schoolteachers protest that ancient
Greek is too difficult for all but the most talented linguists.
   While ancient Greek shares an alphabet and a wide range of
vocabulary with the present-day language, its grammar and structure
are much more complex.
   ``It is a fallacy that ancient Greek can be easily grasped by
every schoolchild,'' Christos Doukas, who heads the Athens-based
High School Teachers' Union, said in an interview.
   But Tritsis said Greek is a very conservative language. He
indicated it would be much less difficult for Greek students to
learn ancient Greek than it would be for American high school
students to learn Old English, which was spoken in England from
around 400 to 1100 A.D., or even the English of Chaucer and
Shakespeare.
   ``The difference in language between Shakespeare's English and
modern English or Chaucer and modern English is greater than that
between Homer and Heroditus and the Greek spoken today,'' he said.
``Despite changes in forms ... the vast amount of words and
expressions are the very same language we use today.''
   Junior high students now study ancient Greek literature during
four 45-minute classes a week. But they read texts that have been
translated into modern Greek.
   Tritsis wants students to begin reading the texts in ancient
Greek.
   High school students take a two-year basic course in ancient
Greek and read some of the original literature. However, they are
not examined on the ancient Greek texts. Tritsis wants those
studies continued at a higher level entirely in the original Greek.
   The students will continue their usual studies of modern Greek
and their two classes a week of either French or English.
   The teachers, however, argue that language lessons should focus
on modern Greek, which a difficult language to master but still
easier than ancient Greek.
   ``Learning ancient Greek from original texts will only confuse
schoolchildren,'' said Doukas of the teachers union. ``Instead we
should all spend more time and energy concentrating on the Greek we
speak today, itself a rich and expressive language.''
   In a major reform of the Greek school system in 1976, compulsory
ancient Greek was dropped from the state high school curriculum as
a ``dead'' language, irrelevant to modern educational needs.
   Now 15- and 16-year-old students intending to go to university
usually take a two-year basic course in ancient Greek, but scholars
say that isn't enough to keep the heritage alive.
   ``Ancient Greek has to be introduced at a much earlier stage in
a child's education, when it helps to develop his imagination,
judgment and memory,'' said Constantine Trypanis, a former culture
minister and retired Oxford University professor of Byzantine and
Modern Greek Studies.
   ``The study of ancient Greek language and literature in the
original is of cardinal importance if that tradition of culture is
to survive.''

<HEAD>Economics and IRS May Undo Innovative Tuition Prepayment Plans</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Economics and the IRS may be undoing an idea
hailed as a possible antidote to rising college costs: tuition
prepayment plans.
   When Duquesne University in Pittsburgh pioneered such a plan in
1985, it seemed a natural. At a time of soaring tuitions, families
could buy higher education ``futures'' contracts. The idea was that
parents would pay a lump sum _ less if their child was young, more
if older _ and investments by the college would swell those funds
to cover tuition costs down the road.
   At Duquesne, for example, the family of a 1-year-old eligible
for college in the year 2005 could have paid a lump sum of $8,630
last fall to cover the projected four-year tuition of $102,604. But
a family of a 12-year-old hoping to enroll at Duquesne in 1994
would have had to put up $19,410 to cover the projected four-year
tuition of $48,747.
   So far so good. Parents purchase peace of mind at a discount,
knowing the plan guarantees four years of college as long as their
child is accepted. The school, in turn, gets a virtual lock on a
future student, hedging against future enrollment declines.
   But it hasn't worked smoothly for Duquesne or the several other
colleges that followed its example, nor for the five states that
have adopted tuition futures plans for public colleges since 1985.
   Duquesne announced last week it was recommending suspension of
its program because of higher-than-expected tuition increases and
lower-than-anticipated earnings on investments. The board of
directors is scheduled to make a final decision March 17.
   Similar programs at the University of Detroit and Canisius
College in Buffalo, N.Y., are likewise at a standstill and not
taking new applicants.
   Three of the five states that enacted tuition futures plans for
public colleges _ Tennessee, Indiana and Michigan _ are in limbo
because the Internal Revenue Service has yet to rule on the tax
status of investment earnings from those plans.
   Wilson Fadely, an IRS spokesman in Washington, refused to
comment on when such a ruling might be handed down.
   ``People contact me and say they are interested,'' said Lawrence
A. Jegen, chairman of the board setting up Indiana's program.
``They have a thirst for a regimented investment program so they
know that if they put their money on the table, their children's or
grandchildren's tuition will be guaranteed.''
   But Jergen said the plan might not be operating July 1 as
originally hoped because of difficulties in predicting future
tuition levels and because of the pending IRS ruling.
   A state-sponsored program that began last August at the
University of Wyoming is going strong and has signed up 332 future
students. Florida officials say they hope to start accepting
applicants next fall.
   Michigan officials remain confident they will eventually get
their program off the ground despite the questions raised by
Duquesne, and despite the fact that state law forbids them from
accepting a single student until the IRS rules.
   ``We'll have no problem at all paying for the program out of
public investments,'' said Richard Cole, higher education adviser
to Gov. James Blanchard.
   ``Duquesne's heart was in the right place, but it appears their
financial brains were in the wrong place,'' said Michigan Treasurer
Robert Bowman. ``They couldn't even gauge their own tuition.''
   But prepayment programs have been controversial from the start.
A number of colleges _ Fairleigh Dickinson University in New
Jersey, for one _ considered and rejected the idea because of the
built-in risks and unpredictability.
   Keith Briscoe, president of Buena Vista College in Storm Lake,
Iowa, called the idea a ``gimmick'' that ``overlooks students' best
interests'' because it deprives them of the chance to select a
school freely.
   The National Association of Independent Colleges and
Universities, which represents about 1,000 private institutions,
has likewise criticized them as inflexible.
   Even backers concede they are a high-risk gamble for both
parents and schools.
   A state or college offering the plan must accurately predict
future tuition and investment trends for years ahead _ or risk
losing money honoring its tuition guarantees.
   Parents, for their part, are gambling that their child will want
to attend a given college, and will qualify for admission. If for
any reaon the child doesn't attend the school in the prepayment
plan, refunds are often limited to the amount parents actually paid
in. That means parents stand to lose tens of thousands of dollars
in investment income.
   What happened at Duquesne was exactly what so many states and
private colleges had feared all along: bond markets weakened last
year and undercut the plan's investment income. Tuitions went up
more than anticipated: by 7.95 percent instead of the predicted 6
percent.
   The result was that the 622 alumni families who had signed up
found themselves with a far more generous bargain than Duquesne
ever intended, or could afford.
   ``Duquesne may be unique, or it may be the likely outcome for
many of these programs. There's just not enough history to
determine the real viability of programs like this,'' said Ron
Gambill, executive director of the Tennessee Student Assistance
Corp., the agency that will administer that state's program once
the IRS rules.
   Some, like Richard Anderson, director of the federally funded
Forum for College Financing at Columbia Teachers College, believe
Duquesne's program must have been, ``first and last, a marketing
tool,'' a premeditated financial giveaway aimed at attracting
future students.
   ``It's true we wanted to offer a program that was going to be
attractive,'' said Duquesne spokeswoman Ann Rago. ``However, the
changes in the economy were drastic. We never said our program was
forever. We started our program to help people, specifically alumni
families. It was not just a marketing a tool.''

<TEXT>
   If this had been another issue, liberal Sen.
Howard Metzenbaum and conservative Sen. James McClure might have
quietly hammered out differences between their rival bills to make
certain that plastic pistols can't get through airport metal
detectors.
   But history has taught that a gun control engagement is never
fought with silencers, even in rare instances like this one, when
rival sponsors have identical goals: stopping terrorists,
especially at airports.
   So once again, bitter enemies of past gun control struggles are
following the usual rules of engagement _ high-powered lobbying,
full-page advertisements, fund-raising appeals and doomsday
rhetoric.
   Sparking the latest debate is a weapon not even on the market.
Red Eye Arms of Winter Park, Fla. says it has a patent for plastic
weapons, but won't start making handguns for at least two years _
and then only for military and police use.
   ``We would never allow anyone to build an undetectable civilian
handgun,'' said company vice president Dwight Brunoehler.
   Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and McClure, R-Idaho, have vastly different
approaches to require that the guns be made detectable. Both would
ban manufacture or importation of any guns that did not meet their
standards.
   Metzenbaum's bill would require a minimum weight of metal to
ensure that an alarm would be triggered at today's magnetometer
settings. Its target is not only future plastic guns, but pint-size
metal pistols that are not detected today.
   The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms estimates
there are three small metal guns that could get through most
magnetometers now used. The gun owners' lobby estimates there are
countless other models.
   McClure's legislation targets plastic guns only, and has no
minimum metallic requirement. However, it would require that guns
be detectable, by either including some metal, a serial number
engraved or stamped on metal, or a substance detectable by X-ray
machines used for luggage.
   Using today's technology, McClure's bill would require more
sensitive magnetometer settings, more alarms, and therefore more
airport passenger inconvenience _ some say gridlock.
   Brunoehler, of Red Eye Arms, says his firm has developed a
computer chip for plastic guns that would make the lower settings
unnecessary. The chip would emit a signal that would make it appear
that an enormous amount of metal was passing through the machine,
he said.
   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Fred Farrar said the
FAA is aware of the chip, but believes it could be disabled by
drilling a hole in it or even placing the weapon in a microwave
oven.
   While these are the technical points for debate, a congressional
gun fight often ranges far beyond the issues at hand and this one
is no exception.
   The principal gun owner's lobby, the National Rifle Association,
told its 2.8 million members in a fund-raising letter last year
that Metzenbaum's real goal is ``the first federal gun ban bill in
America.''
   ``If Sen. Metzenbaum's bill passes, the next thing will be some
government official knocking at your door to weigh your guns for
inspection,'' said the NRA, which backs the McClure bill.
   To Handgun Control Inc., the most visible lobby for pistol
regulation, the issue is what the group calls the NRA's extremism.
``Cop-killer bullets, mail-order handguns, machine guns...has the
NRA gone off the deep end?'' says HCI ads, which have different
police chiefs using those same words.
   Handgun Control supports Metzenbaum. So do a dozen law
enforcement organizations.
   ``Both sides are simply waving flags so believers will send
money to Handgun Control Inc. and to the National Rifle
Association,'' says John Aquilino, a former NRA official who now
publishes his own gun owners' newsletter. ``They're making
advertising agencies very wealthy. It's flag-waving and
fund-raising.''
   The latest battle reflects new political realities that surfaced
in 1986. Then, the major law enforcement organizations joined
forces with handgun control advocates to fight NRA-backed
legislation to ease many restrictions of the 1968 Gun Control Act.
   The presence of uniformed policemen lobbying their local
lawmakers began to neutralize some of the NRA's seemingly
invincible clout.
   Nonetheless, the gun lobby attained many of its goals two years
ago with passage of the McClure-Volkmer Act, which changed a number
of provisions of the 1968 law. But the invigorated gun
control-police alliance was able to retain, as part of that fight,
a ban on interstate sales of handguns.
   Now, the same coalition of police and gun control advocates is
back on the detectability question. But Jerald R. Vaughn, executive
director of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, says
of his fellow police lobbyists, ``We're still babes in the woods
when it comes to the political process.''
   Yet, the NRA has taken an unusual turn by backing McClure's
bill. The group normally opposes any legislation that could bring
more restrictions on firearms.
   Only last May, NRA Governmental Affairs Director James Jay Baker
told a House panel, ``The NRA believes that the only workable
approach'' to the detection problem is better security at airports.
   He said ``attempts to dictate metallic content of firearms or
chemical composition of non-metallic components of firearms'' were
unnecessary.
   ``Their position from day one has been, there shall never be any
law on guns,'' said N.T. ``Pete'' Shields, chairman of Handgun
Control Inc.
   ``All of a sudden this issue of plastic handguns has made them
compromise this whole concept. I think they have come a long way,
but I think they're trying to address it with smoke. McClure's bill
is impractical. You would bottle up the airport.''
   Baker said in an interview, ``The NRA has moved a long way on
this issue. We decided to take the bull by the horns and deal with
the terms as framed by the other side. If they're interested in
detectability, it can be done with no interference with existing
firearms.''
   Metzenbaum's most prominent Senate ally is Strom Thurmond, a
conservative South Carolina Republican and ranking Republican on
the Judiciary Committee. Metzenbaum and Thurmond tried to win
passage of their legislation last December, but it was tabled by a
47-42 vote.
   Metzenbaum, in an interview, called McClure's bill ``purely
cosmetic.''
   McClure, also in an interview, said he rejects any arbitrary
metallic standard, and called any potential inconvenience ``part of
the price you pay for having secure airports.''

<HEAD>Lincoln Town Car Practically Drives Itself</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto and LaserGraphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Lincoln Town Car, long a best-seller at Ford
Motor Co.'s Lincoln-Mercury division, continues to confound the
skeptics.
   The body style, originally introduced as the 1980 Lincoln
Continental Town Car has had a stronger increase in sales since
1983 than have European luxury cars, according to a Ford analyst.
   After test-driving the 1988 Signature Series Town Car, I can see
why.
   The auto, a big, heavy monster still with the basic design it
had in the late 1970s, practically drove itself (although critics
might note that for a price of nearly $28,000 the car should do a
lot of things).
   I didn't have to remember to turn on the headlights. They did
that themselves, sensing when outside light was low, thanks to an
auto lamp on-off system.
   The headlights also switched from low to high beams
automatically and turned themselves off when the ignition was
turned off. I didn't have to remember to lock the doors before I
drove off.
   The car has an automatic system that locks them once ignition is
on, all doors are closed, the transmission is shifted through
reverse and someone is in the driver seat.
   I didn't even have to remember to switch the rearview mirror to
ward off headlight glare from other vehicles. The test car had the
optional (for $89) automatic dim day-night mirror that flipped to
protect driver eyes from glare every time a vehicle approached the
rear. It flipped back to normal when no vehicle was close behind.
   So, all I had to do was get inside, start up the car, shift and
step on the gas pedal. Away I went, along with 4,100 pounds of
sheer automotive force.
   If you want that size of car and that configuration (rear drive,
big weight, luxury domestic), there aren't many choices _ probably
the Town Car or a Cadillac, said Ford analyst Ray Windecker. Sales
of Town Cars have increased 90 percent since 1983, while sales of
all Cadillac models have fallen 8 percent.
   European luxury car sales also haven't risen as fast as they
have for Town Cars, he said, citing a 39 percent boost at
Mercedes-Benz and 62 percent at BMW. Overall, the U.S. luxury car
market is up 35 percent from 1983, he added.
   Town Car sales in the 1987 model year totaled 136,085, up from
119,180 in the 1986 model year, Windecker said.
   The plant producing the big cars has been on overtime nearly
every day. The demand is that great, he said.
   However, he added sales likely will decline a bit in the current
model year because the plant is building a newly designed Lincoln
Continental and work on those models is expected to curtail some
Town Car production.
   Town Car buyers are older, with median age of 60. (Actually, 53
percent are over age 60.) Forty percent of buyers are retired, and
median income is $58,000 a year, Ford said. Thirty-eight percent
are at least college grads.
   Besides appreciating the many automatic features on the Town
Car, those buyers can enjoy standard, heated outside side mirrors
and lighted thermometer that tells the outside temperature. There's
an expansive interior _ no complaints about a cramped back seat
here _ and carpet is 30-ounce cut pile.
   Also part of the 219-inch-long vehicle is a trunk that is huge,
even with a full-sized spare tire inside. The hood, where the
mighty 5-liter, electronic fuel-injected V-8 resides, juts out
front so far I nearly hit the back of another car at a stop sign
before I realized I wasn't in one of those down sized vehicles with
little hoods I'm used to.
   I did find the interior cloth upholstery (navy in the test car)
showed some spills, and I couldn't slide in the seat. Rather, I had
to lift myself and settle in.
   With so much weight and such a big engine coupled with automatic
transmission, fuel economy suffers, with only 17 mpg listed for
city driving. A fill up can be costly _ one gas station visit left
me $20 poorer.
   And, the car had a somewhat mushy suspension.
   Consumer Reports said buyer surveys showed 1983-85 Town Cars
ranked better than average in its trouble index and average in the
1986 model year, the last year available.
   The Town Car continues to show what a big American car can be
and likely will be for the foreseeable future.
   Despite talk that it's just a matter of time before large,
rear-drive American cars disappear from showrooms, a Ford official
says the company plans on keeping the popular Town Car around for
some time.

<TEXT>
   On the fringes of the multi-ethnic empire that the
Communists seized from the czars, minorities emboldened by Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's reforms are clamoring for a greater say in their
future and challenging the dictates of Moscow.
   In recent weeks, Armenians by the tens of thousands have marched
in the streets, Estonians have massed at a monument in their
capital and police have locked Lithuanian activists in their homes
to keep them from marking the brief period Lithuania was an
independent country.
   In the most dramatic incident, some members of two neighboring
nationalities in the southern Caucasus republics have directed
their hostility not at Moscow, but at each other.
   A rancorous territorial dispute has caused bloodshed, injuries
and deaths involving the Armenians and neighboring Azeris, and some
fearful Azeris, natives of the Azerbaijan republic, have fled their
homes.
   The violence, and the palpable swelling of nationalist feelings
on the Soviet periphery, pose one of the greatest problems yet for
General Secretary Gorbachev's Kremlin, which is trying to enact
nationwide standards of discipline and efficiency, but also to
decentralize economic control.
   Events have also poignantly shown how much the Soviet Union, far
from being an ethnic melting pot, is still the uneasy
conglomeration of disparate peoples that was dubbed by one
disapproving 19th-century visitor to Russia, Adolphe de Custine, as
``a prison of nations.''
   In the 70 years of Soviet power, the Moscow-based Communist
Party and government have viciously fought centrifugal forces they
feared might split the country into its ethnic components, and the
current party program adopted in 1986 under Gorbachev speaks of a
``single Soviet people.''
   But the Soviet Union extends from central Europe to the Far East
and is peopled by more than 100 ethnic strains and speaking 120
different languages or dialects. They range from the dominant
Russians, who make up more than 40 percent of the population of
284.5 million, to the Aleuts, a Far Northern tribe with fewer than
500 members.
   Gorbachev has called the formulation of a comprehensive policy
to ensure national unity while granting each ethnic group its own
cultural and linguistic rights ``the most vital, fundamental issue
of our society.''
   ``The unique feature of our culture is that it is
multi-ethnic,'' Gorbachev said in February. ``Nationalism in any
form is blind. Attempts at self-isolation lead down a spiritual
blind alley.''
   Underlining the importance of working out a new policy on
nationalities, Gorbachev said the Central Committee, the Communist
Party's policy-making body, would hold a special plenary session to
discuss the matter.
   The day Gorbachev made those remarks, Feb. 18, demonstrations
began in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, to protest the Central
Committee's refusal to permit the joining of the Nagorno-Karabakh
region, part of Azerbaijan since 1923 despite its largely Armenian
population, to Armenia itself.
   The protests swelled, with some witnesses claiming that more
than 1 million people had taken to Yerevan's streets. Whatever the
size, the rallies were the largest unsanctioned gatherings in
Soviet history.
   Some in the crowd proclaimed that the future of the contested
region that is smaller than the state of Delaware will demonstrate
how Gorbachev's entire national reform program is to proceed.
   ``Karabakh is a test of perestroika (Gorbachev's reforms),''
declared some of the banners carried by chanting and singing
Armenians.
   Although in theory and under the 1977 Constitution, all of the
country's nationalities are equal, the Russians and their Slavic
cousins, the Ukrainians and Byelorussians, have a firm hold on the
actual levers of power.
   The ruling Politburo shows clearly the extent of Slavic
domination. A dozen of its members, including Gorbachev, are Slavs,
while only one is not _ Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, a
Georgian.
   Despite official rhetoric lauding the equality of nations,
Russian pre-eminence is even enshrined in the Soviet national
anthem, whose first stanza begins: ``An unbreakable union of free
republics has been forged forever by Great Russia.''
   The 15 constituent Soviet republics have been tightly controlled
by Moscow over the years, but Gorbachev's drive for greater citizen
participation, plus his campaign for ``glasnost,'' or openness,
have stirred both hopes and doubts about how far Moscow will allow
ethnic minorities to go.
   At the same time, Gorbachev has ignored the penchant of his
predecessor, Leonid I. Brezhnev, to let local elites run the
economic and social affairs of their republics, providing they
adhered to the dictates of Moscow.
   It was the replacement by Gorbachev of Kazakhstan's ethnic
Kazakh party chief by a Russian that sparked two days of rioting in
the Central Asian city of Alma Ata on Dec. 17-18, 1986, in which
two people were killed and 200 injured.
   The recent outbursts involving Armenians and Azeris may
strengthen the hand of Kremlin conservatives who think Gorbachev's
reforms undermine the traditional submission of distant
nationalities to the central Russian power structure.
   The more candid exploration of the legacy of dictator Josef V.
Stalin promoted by orbachev has also brought calls from Baltic
activists to extend glasnost to cover the forced incorporation of
Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia into the Soviet Union in 1940.
   ``We want to raise the consciousness of people so they remember
they have the right to be free,'' said the Lithuanian activist
Jadvyga Beliauskiene last month as police prevented activists from
publicly marking the 70th anniversary Feb. 17 of Lithuania's
declaration of independence.
   A group of Estonians gathered in Tallinn on Feb. 26, the 70th
anniversary of Estonia's declaration of independence from Soviet
Russia. Dissident sources in Moscow said 2,500 to 3,000 people
attended, and official media confirmed the rally took place.
   The contested region in Azerbaijan shows in microcosm the
problems faced by the Kremlin on a national scale in formulating a
nationalities policy that takes all pieces of the country's human
mosaic into account.
   The small region is more than three-quarters Armenian, but has
residents of 48 other groups.

   Rising interest rates and plentiful apartment vacancies
contributed to a 14 percent decline in new housing starts last
year, according to a report by a private business information
concern.
   The report Wednesday by the F.W. Dodge Division of McGraw-Hill
Information Systems Co. said only three of the nation's top 10
metropolitan areas _ Washington, D.C., Detroit and Philadelphia _
showed any pickup in construction activity last year.
   ``High vacancy rates and high mortgage rates took a heavy toll
of apartment and one-family building alike last year,'' said George
A. Christie, chief economist for F.W. Dodge.
   In other news, the stock market's recent rally bogged down
Wednesday as blue chips gave up some of their gains from the day
before. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, up 24.70
points on Tuesday, dropped back 6.80 to 2,074.27.
   Nevertheless, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 4
to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Confidence has continued to spread lately on Wall Street that
the economy remains healthy nearly five months after Black Monday
on Oct. 19.
   In addition, stock prices have been less volatile lately than
they were as recently as early January, suggesting that investors'
mood is less subject to sudden change.
   Analysts say investing institutions have grown more eager to put
some of their cash reserves into stocks, in order to show in their
first-quarter reports to clients that they participated in the
recent market rally.
   Bond prices finished little changed. The yield on the Treasury's
bellwether 30-year issue slipped to 8.51 percent from 8.52 percent.
   The dollar rose slightly against major currencies late in the
day as world markets remained transfixed by the surging British
pound, analysts said. Gold prices were also higher.
   Crude oil prices edged upward and refined products ended mixed.
Market analysts said there were few developments to influence
trading.

   Crude oil futures have crept higher in
lackluster markets in the absence of any major influential
developments.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for April
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude,
settled at $15.49 per barrel on Wednesday, up 4 cents from
Tuesday's close.
   Refined products traded on the exchange were mixed.
   Wholesale heating oil slipped .46 cent to 43.03 cents a gallon.
Some analysts attributed the decline in heating oil to milder
weather, which reduces demand.
   But an expected increase in demand for gasoline was credited for
a 0.29 cent rise, to 44.00 cents, in the April contract for
wholesale unleaded gas. Analysts said distributors have been
carrying low inventories, and demand is expected to pick up with
the imminent arrival of the spring and summer driving seasons.
   Crude oil trading was stalled by conflicting reports about Saudi
Arabia's support for a meeting of the OPEC pricing committee, said
John Azarow, senior trader for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Some members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries have called for a meeting of the committee because the
price of OPEC oil has slipped to between $13 and $14 a barrel. At
their last meeting in December, OPEC oil ministers reaffirmed their
intention to maintain prices at $18 a barrel.
   Prices on world markets have fallen because of moderate demand
for oil, price discounting by OPEC members and an increase in
output by non-OPEC producers.

<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York clothing designer Alexander
Julian plans a return to his native Tar Heel state this summer with
a new men's clothing store that he hopes will be the beginning of a
national chain.
   Julian, who also is designing uniforms for the Charlotte
Hornets, a new National Basketball Association entry, will open a
retail store here in July, said a spokesman for the designer.
   ``As a native North Carolinian, Alexander has a great affinity
for the state,'' Barry Miguel, creative director for Alexander
Julian Inc. of New York, said in a recent telephone interview. ``At
the same time, he feels Charlotte is a growing city and a growing
marketplace.''
   Julian was not available for an interview.
   The new stores will sell an upscale line of clothing and
accessories called the Alexander Julian Collection.
   ``We've expanded our men's collection,'' Miguel said. ``We have
more sportswear now than previously.''
   Julian, the 39-year-old son of a Chapel Hill haberdasher, is
considered one of the nation's top clothing designers. Although he
resides just outside New York, in Greenwich, Conn., he makes no
secret of his love for his native state.
   Julian also shares the state's passion for basketball. That's
why Hornets owner George Shinn approached Julian last year about
designing uniforms for the expansion team, which will begin play in
the 1988-89 NBA season.
   ``I felt like I wanted to lead the league in something the first
year,'' Shinn said at the time. ``I felt that being best dressed
was the way to go.''
   For his design work on the basketball team's uniforms, Julian is
being paid 10 pounds of North Carolina barbecue, delivered once a
month to his office on New York's East Side office.
   Julian's company is readying its 3,200-square-foot prototype
store for the July opening, said company president, Marty Staff.
The store's interior will be designed by Walker & Associates of New
York, which has done design work for Bloomingdale's and Calvin
Klein shops.
   A second store will open in late summer in Atlanta, followed by
another in the Northeast corridor, Miguel said.
   ``We hope to have 30 to 40 stores in the next five years,'' he
said.
   Cluett Peabody & Co. will continue to produce the Colours by
Alexander Julian line For Men and Levi Strauss & Co. will still
make the Colours by Alexander Julian for Women, Staff said.
   Julian, who is chairman and part-owner of the new company, plans
to visit the Charlotte store frequently, Miguel said. Several
venture capital firms also own stock in the company, including
Harvard Management Co. and New Enterprises Associates of San
Francisco, he said.

<HEAD>Campeau Revives Fight Against Federated Poison Pill Defense</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campeau Corp. is renewing its attempt to block
Federated Department Stores Inc.'s ``poison pill'' takeover
defense, contending the plan wrongly denies Federated shareholders
the chance to choose between rival buyout offers.
   Campeau, which is competing with R.H. Macy & Co. Inc. to acquire
Federated, filed a brief Tuesday in federal court to revive its
request for an injunction against the plan.
   The Toronto-based company called the rights plan a ``show
stopper'' that would block Campeau's $6.18 billion offer for
Federated.
   The plan makes a hostile takeover attempt more expensive by
allowing Federated shareholders to buy more of the company's stock
at a heavy discount.
   Campeau suspended its attack on the poison pill after the
company appeared to be close to an acquisition agreement with
Federated in late February. However, when the Federated board met
to consider accepting Campeau's offer on Feb. 29, it also began
reviewing the Macy bid.
   Macy, which last week signed a $6.1 billion definitive buyout
agreement with Federated, on Tuesday began a tender offer for
Federated's common stock. Under the offer, Macy will pay $74.50 per
share in cash for approximately 80 percent of Federated's stock.
Macy plans to swap shares in a new company, Macy's-Federated Inc.,
for the remaining 20 percent of Federated's shares.
   Analysts have valued the Macy bid at $6.1 billion.
   Campeau is offering $75 in cash per share for 80 percent of
Federated's stock and $44 in cash per share for the remaining 20
percent. The Campeau bid, which has an aggregate value of $68 per
share, totals $6.18 billion.
   Macy also went to federal court Tuesday, seeking an injunction
against the Campeau bid. Macy contended the Campeau offer, which
was amended from an earlier $68-a-share outright cash bid, actually
was a new offer and under federal law must remain open past its
March 15 scheduled expiration.
   If the Macy request is granted it effectively would put the
Campeau offer on a more equal footing with the Macy bid, which is
scheduled to expire April 4, by reducing pressure on Federated
shareholders to make a choice.
   Under federal law, a new offer would have to remain open for at
least 20 business days after publication or submission to
stockholders.
   Campeau's bid was announced March 2. If it is considered a new
offer, it could not legally expire on March 15 as scheduled.
   Federated, the nation's fifth-largest retailer, owns department
stores including Bloomingdale's, Lazarus, Rich's, Abraham & Straus,
Bullock's and Burdine's.
   Macy holdings include nearly 100 department and specialty stores
and Campeau, a real estate developer, owns Allied Stores Corp.

<TEXT>
   United Artists Communications Inc. and United
Cable Television Corp. have agreed to combine their operations into
a $3.8 billion concern that would rank as one of nation's biggest
cable companies.
   The transaction, disclosed Wednesday and approved by the
directors of both Denver-based companies, would create United
Artists Entertainment Co., which would have interests in both cable
television and motion picture theaters.
   The two companies had agreed on an all-stock merger shortly
before the October stock market crash, but canceled the deal soon
after, citing disagreement over the terms and uncertain market
conditions.
   They announced in January that they had resumed their
discussions.
   The new deal is subject to approval of the companies'
shareholders and federal regulators and favorable tax rulings,
among other conditions, the companies said. They said they hoped to
complete the deal later this year.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, United Cable rose
$2.87{ a share to $32.62{. In over-the-counter trading, United
Artists rose $2.25 a share to $29.75.
   The new company would have about 2.3 million cable subscribers
by the end of the year, said Stewart D. Blair, chairman and chief
executive of United Artists.
   That would place the new concern behind only the two industry
leaders in terms of subscribers, Tele-Communications Inc. and
American Television and Communications Inc., according to Paul
Kagan Associates, a media research and investment concern in
Carmel, Calif.
   Tele-Communications, which also is based in Denver, currently
owns 65 percent of United Artists and 23.7 percent of United Cable.
Its stake in the new company would be about 52 percent, the
announcement said.
   Under the new agreement, United Artists' stockholders would
receive one share of the new company for every share they currently
own of United Artists. United Cable shareholders would be eligible
to convert each of their shares into either $35 in cash or a share
of stock in the new company and the separable right to sell a share
of the new company's stock under special terms.
   The cash portion of the offer would be available on up to 49
percent of United Cable's 46.4 million fully diluted shares.
   William J. Elsner, senior vice president and chief financial
officer at United Cable, said the October agreement had been
criticized for failing to include a cash alternative.
   Sharon Armbrust, a senior analyst for Paul Kagan Associates,
estimated the new company was being capitalized at about $3.8
billion.
   That figure includes $2.4 billion in stock, $600 million in
existing debt and $800 million in new borrowing needed for the cash
portion of the deal.
   Blair would be chief executive and vice chairman of the new
company. United Cable's chairman, Gene W. Schneider, would be
chairman of the new company.
   United Artists has about 800,000 subscribers and recently agreed
to acquire the cable television division of Daniels & Associates,
which has about 380,000 subscribers. United Cable has about 1.1
million subscribers.
   United Artists also is one of the nation's biggest motion
picture operators with about 2,050 motion picture screens and plans
to boost that total by the end of the year to about 3,000 through
acquisitions and construction.
   The announcement said the new company would operate the cable
operations under the name United Cable and the theatrical
operations under the United Artists name.

<HEAD>Several Newspapers Agree to Create Ad ``Island'' on Stock Pages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several major newspapers are hoping that putting
an ``island'' of advertising in their sea of stock tables will help
attract more national advertisers to the medium.
   The first ad buyer to participate in the unusual effort is
National Car Rental System Inc.
   The Minneapolis-based company said Wednesday it would spend $2
million through the end of the year to put quarter-page ads in what
is being called a new ``island'' position on the first page of the
stock table sections of 16 newspapers in the nation's 20 biggest
markets.
   The ads, which will be surrounded on four sides by stock
quotations, will appear a minimum of 26 times starting March 17 in
each newspaper, according to Lewis Carbone, a National marketing
executive.
   A committee of the National Advertising Bureau, a trade
organization, came up with the idea for the unusual ad position
and, along with National's ad agency, Chiat-Day Inc., persuaded the
16 newspapers to sell it.
   Michael Davies, head of the newspaper bureau panel and editor
and publisher of the Hartford Courant, said the committee looked at
a dozen proposals for displaying advertising more distinctively
before deciding on this approach.
   He said the committee wanted to find a way to help an ad message
stand out without disrupting normal reading patterns.
   Putting an ad in the stock tables seemed appropriate, he said,
because people usually look for individual stock prices rather than
reading through the entire section. ``This doesn't interrupt the
flow of reading a page,'' he said.
   But some big newspapers turned down the idea.
   The New York Times rejected it because ``it would make it too
hard for the reader to get through the stock tables,'' according to
spokeswoman Nancy Nielsen.
   The Wall Street Journal also balked. Bernard T. Flanagan, vice
president for marketing, said the placement would be ``an
inconvenience to the reader.'' ``In a sense, we want to make it as
easy as we can for readers to look up their stock quotes,'' he said.
   Flanagan said the ad placement also ``takes prestige away from
the page.''
   Newspapers have seen their share of national advertising
spending decline steadily in recent years as national advertisers
turned to television.
   Newspapers took in 15.9 percent of total national ad spending in
1950, but fell to below 6 percent in 1986.
   Last year, national advertisers spent $3.5 billion in
newspapers, or about 5.8 percent of their total spending of $60.6
billion, according to an estimate by the ad agency McCann-Erickson
Inc.
   But Robert Zach, media director for Chiat-Day, said the rising
cost of television time is making advertisers more receptive to
alternative ways to reach customers.
   Davies said he expected other advertisers would take an interest
in the new ad position and that other newspapers would embrace the
idea.
   The 16 newspapers that have sold the space to National include:
the Atlanta Journal and Constitution, Chicago Sun-Times, Dallas
Morning News, Detroit Free Press, Hartford Courant, Houston
Chronicle, Los Angeles Times, Miami Herald, Minneapolis Star and
Tribune, Phoenix Gazette, Rocky Mountain News, San Francisco
Chronicle and Examiner, Seattle Times, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, St.
Paul Pioneer Press and Dispatch and Tampa Tribune.

<HEAD>Black Monday Helping Boost In Savings Deposits, Decline in
Mortgage Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Home mortgage rates fell at the quickest pace
since 1986 early this year, partly because of the broad decline in
interest rates in the wake of the October stock market crash,
according to the government.
   The stock market collapse also played a role in boosting net
deposits at the nation's savings institutions during January for
the fourth straight month, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board
reported Wednesday.
   Effective rates on typical 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages for
single-family homes dropped to 10.5 percent in early February from
10.97 percent in early January. Rates on the most popular type of
adjustable rate mortgages, those with caps on how much the rate can
change, fell to 8.74 percent from 8.98 percent over the same period.
   ``The decline in commitment rates is consistent with the
softening of mortgage demand that generally occurs during the
winter months,'' said James Barth, the bank board's chief economist.
   ``However, the recent declines were the sharpest since
1986...and appear to have reflected mainly large deposit
flows...after the stock market collapse...and an across-the-board
decline in interest rates,'' he said.
   Mortgage lending by S&Ls in January declined to the lowest level
since February 1985. Savings institutions lent $13.1 billion in
mortgages, down more than the usual seasonal dropoff from $21.7
billion in December.
   ``Contributing to the reduced lending volume was a lingering
skittishness on the part of potential home buyers following the
Oct. 19 collapse in stock prices,'' Barth said in a statement.
   The spread between fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages
narrowed to 1.76 percent, the smallest difference since last
spring. The proportion of mortgages being closed with adjustable
rates edged down from 65 percent in December to 63 percent a month
later.
   But the popularity of adjustable-rate loans remains far higher
than last spring, when they represented 20 to 30 percent of the
market.
   A separate survey of mortgage rates by the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. indicated 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged
9.85 percent last Friday, down slightly from 9.87 percent a week
earlier and sharply lower than 10.61 percent on Jan. 1. This survey
does not include add-on fees, known as points, which are included
in the bank board's averages.
   The bank board also said net new deposits at the nation's 3,135
federally insured S&Ls increased by $5.6 billion in January,
following a $2.6 billion increase in December. That compared with
net withdrawals of $2.1 billion in January a year ago.
   Barth said deposits normally increase from December to January,
but he added, ``Nearly half of the most recent improvement
represented non-seasonal factors. Undoubtedly, the precipitous
decline in the stock market remains one of these factors.''
   Nervous investors, seeking a safe haven for their money,
increased deposits by $6.2 billion in October and $3.2 billion in
November.
   The last four months represent a sharp reversal of the trend in
recent years, which has been described as a slow-motion run on
thrift institutions. There were net withdrawals of $3.3 billion in
1986 and $13.7 billion in the first nine months of 1987.

<HEAD>SEC Opposes New York Takeover Law As Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission says
New York's anti-takeover law is an unconstitutional impediment to
interstate commerce.
   The SEC also contended Wednesday that the statute conflicts with
the Williams Act, the 1968 federal law regulating corporate
takeovers.
   The agency made its arguments in a friend-of-the-court brief
filed in a suit brought by Salant Acquisition Corp. against
Manhattan Industries Inc., one of the nation's biggest makers of
men's shirts and sportswear.
   Proliferation of state anti-takeover laws since the Supreme
Court upheld Indiana's takeover statute last year has heightened
the issue of whether the federal or state governments should take
the lead in regulating corporate takeovers.
   The New York law prohibits a bidder who acquires more than 20
percent of a company's stock from completing a takeover or other
major business transaciton with the company for five years, unless
the bidder gets approval from the target's board of directors.
   ``The statute gives corporate management virtual veto power over
whether the company will be acquired,'' SEC General Counsel Daniel
L. Goelzer wrote in the brief.
   The law effectively preempts the Williams Act, he argued.
   Goelzer said ``the structure and the legislative history of the
(Williams) act make it clear that Congress believed that...it
should be the shareholders _ the owners of the corporation _ who
make the decision,'' not the management.
   The SEC, which regulates the nation's securities markets, is
intervening in the case in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on the
side of Salant.
   Salant, a unit of Salant Corp., another major apparel maker,
began a $95 million hostile takeover attempt of Manhattan
Industries in February.
   Manhattan Industries had sought to block the $16-a-share buyout
offer Salant launched on Feb. 2. U.S. District Judge Louis L.
Stanton last week denied Manhattan Industries' request for a court
order blocking the tender offer but did not rule on Salant's
constitutional challenge.
   Manhattan Industries said Wednesday it had entered into
negotiations about a possible merger with Salant.
   The SEC took a similar position when the Supreme Court
considered a challenge to Indiana's anti-takeover law last year,
but the court upheld the law.
   In another current battle, the SEC has indicated it was
considering whether to file briefs in suits challenging the newly
enacted Delaware anti-takeover law, which is structured somewhat
similarly to New York's law.

<BYLINE>By DOUG FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TROY, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. says
it may export to Japan some of the approximately 1 million
large-screen color television picture tubes it will make each year
in this western Ohio city.
   The $160 million Matsushita plant is to open in spring 1989 with
240 people and production of 400,000 tubes, company officials said
Wednesday.
   That will expand to about 400 jobs once full production is
reached in two or three years, said Fumio Kanazwa, president of the
subsidiary Matsushita Electronics Corp.
   The company announced it planned to build a plant in Troy last
December, but disclosed no details until Wednesday.
   Kanazawa declined to specify under what conditions Matsushita
would export tubes to Japan, where Matsushita already makes some
large-screen tubes, but said it would not depend just on the
yen-dollar exchange rate.
   The plant will make 29- and 33-inch tubes, although it could be
reconfigured to produce smaller picture tubes, said Yasuhiko
Yamaguchi, who will be president of American Matsushita Electronics
Corp.
   Production at Troy will represent slightly more than 10 percent
of the total picture tube production by Matsushita, which had total
1987 revenue of more than $36 billion.
   Matsushita, which makes Panasonic, Quasar, Technics and National
brand consumer electronics, began producing televisions in the
United States with acquisition of the Quasar plant from Motorola in
1974, spokesman Justin Camerlengo said.
   Matsushita has been buying about one-third of its picture tubes
in the United States, he said.
   Honda of America on Monday became the first Japanese automaker
to export to Japan when it shipped off 540 Accords made at its
Marysville plant.
   Honda, the fourth-largest automaker in the United States, plans
to export 4,000 Accords to Japan this year and 50,000 U.S.-built
cars to Japan annually by 1991.

<HEAD>USG Urges Rejection of Desert Partners' Buyout Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officers of USG Corp. are urging the building
materials company's shareholders to reject a $1.9 billion hostile
takeover offer as inadequate and coercive, and say the company
might sell a major stake to a third party.
   USG Chairman Robert J. Day wrote shareholders Wednesday that
they should reject the unsolicited $42-a-share tender offer by
Desert Partners LP, a group led by Texas oilmen Jack E. Brown and
Cyril Wagner Jr.
   USG also disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission
filing that it may sell a substantial stake in USG to a third,
unidentified company.
   Placing a big block of shares in friendly hands, a maneuver
known as the ``white squire'' takeover defense, would make it more
difficult if not impossible for Desert Partners to acquire control
of the company.
   Desert Partners on March 1 launched a tender offer of $42 in
cash for each of 21.5 million shares of USG stock. The group also
offered to acquire the balance of USG's 50.8 million outstanding
shares with securities it valued at $42 a share. Desert Partners
already owns about 9.9 percent of USG stock.
   Day questioned the value of securities portion of Desert
Partners' offer, saying it consisted of junk bonds and warrants
``purportedly worth $42 per share.''
   Paul Colitti, a USG spokesman, said the company believed the
$42-per-share cash portion of the offer also did not reflect USG's
true value.
   USG stock fell $1.62{ to $36.50 a share Wednesday on the New
York Stock Exchange, indicating investor doubts about the
seriousness of Desert Partners' offer.
   Desert Partners responded to USG's decision late Wednesday with
a letter to the company's board saying it was prepared to negotiate
its tender offer.
   Desert Partners also chastised USG for considering selling a
chunk of the company to a third party, in what the Texas group
called an attempt to block its takeover bid.
   ``We are certain that your stockholders would much prefer your
entering into prompt good-faith negotiations with us rather than
your continuing to devote effort and expense to defensive tactics
that can only erode the value of USG shares,'' Desert Partners said
in its letter.
   Colitti said USG's discussions with another party did not
necessarily mean a deal was imminent.
   Desert Partners bought its USG shares last year for about $44.30
a share in a previous takeover attempt that fizzled when the Texas
group was unable to arrange the necessary financing.
   Desert Partners also is seeking shareholder purchase rights that
take effect Friday and that were triggered by the tender offer.
   The purchase rights, part of USG's ``poison-pill'' takeover
defense, would allow all shareholders except Desert Partners to buy
additional new USG stock, making completion of a takeover
prohibitively expensive.
   Desert Partners has filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in
Chicago challenging the legality of the poison pill and has said it
will seek to elect six directors to USG's 15-member board at the
company's annual meeting in May.
   USG, based in Chicago, is a leading producer of gypsum and
building materials, with about 100 plants nationwide.

   Consumer prices rose 8.3 percent in February
but only 2.8 percent in the last half of the month, an indication
that the government's inflation-fighting program is working, the
central bank said.
   The Bank of Mexico report Wednesday noted the rate was well
below the 15.5 percent in January.
   It said there was the prospect, ``based on the two-week
variation of 2.8 percent and the favorable behavior of the
principal fiscal and financial variables, of strong further
reductions in the inflationary rates.''
   As part of its program, called the Economic Solidarity Pact, the
government has said prices on officially regulated items will be
frozen for the month of March and the peso, which has been steadily
devaluing against the dollar, will be held steady.
   A minimum wage increase was held to 3 percent for the month,
below what was expected.
   The biggest price increases, both for the month of February and
the last two weeks of the month, were in furniture and domestic
goods, including appliances, soaps and paper articles, the bank
said. For the month, prices on those articles jumped 16.2 percent.
   Health and personal items, clothes and shoes and educational
services were among others with substantial increases.
   Also rising were rent; some foods, including basics such as
cooking oil, processed milk, corn and wheat flour, rice and beans;
automobiles; insurance; books, newspapers and school materials;
alcoholic beverages, and cigarettes.
   The cities with the highest increases were Matamoros, across the
border from Brownsville, Texas, the northern city of Chihuahua and
Cordoba, in the Gulf coast state of Veracruz.
   Those where inflation was held down were Navojoa, in the
northwestern state of Sonora; Tulancingo, northeast of Mexico City;
and La Paz, in Southern Baja California.
   Bringing down inflation, which hit a record 159.2 percent for
1987, currently is the main target of the government's economic
program.
   The pact, announced in mid-December, calls on business, industry
and labor to cooperate with the government in holding down prices.

<HEAD>Former Merchant Banker Lord Spens Arrested in Guinness Affair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former merchant banker Lord Patrick Spens was
arrested Thursday in connection with the case stemming from
Guinness PLC's 1986 takeover of Distillers Co. PLC.
   Fraud squad detectives arrested Spens, 45, a former managing
director of merchant bankers Henry Ansbacher and Co. Ltd., at his
home in the southeast England town of Gould and took him to a
London police station for questioning, Scotland Yard said.
   He was the fifth man to be arrested in the case.
   Scotland Yard said it is investigating the alleged purchase of
2.15 million Guinness shares for 7.6 million pounds, the equivalent
of $14 million, from Ansbacher clients during the Guinness takeover
of Distillers, a Scotch whiskey and gin maker.
   Spens resigned from his 100,000-pound-a-year post at Ansbacher
in January 1987 under pressure from the Bank of England, and told
reporters his alleged role in the Guinness affair was perceived as
an error of judgment.
   ``I acted properly and I don't think there was anything
inappropriate in what I did,'' he said.
   Police are investigating Guinness's tactics during its 2.6
billion-pound takeover of Distillers.
   Guinness, a major brewer, has admitted arranging for the illegal
repurchase of its stock in an apparent effort to boost its share
price and make its cash and stock offer for Distillers more
attractive than a rival bid from Argyll Group PLC, a supermarket
operator.
   At the center of the investigation is deposed Guinness chairman
Ernest Saunders, who remains free on 500,000 pounds bail after
being charged with 40 offenses.
   Others facing charges are former Morgan Grenfell merchant bank
director Roger Seelig and businessmen Sir Jack Lyons and Gerald
Ronson.

   Shopowners in the Greek capital pulled
down their shutters on Thursday to demand the return of the
traditional afternoon break abolished by the government last month
in favor of continuous working hours.
   Athens' 15,000 twxi drivers also locked up their taxis for a day
to protest anti-pollution measures. The ban restricts half of the
taxis from entering the center of the city on weekdays according to
license plates that end in odd or even numbers.
   Shopkeepers gathered at a downtown theater and later marched to
parliament to press their claim for a different set of work hours.
Large department stores and supermarket chains, however,
disregarded the strike call and remained open.
   The new store-hours, in effect from Feb. 1, replaced more than
40 different work-schedules for different kinds of shops, with a
continuous 50-hour work week.

   The list of American high-technology goods
China is allowed to buy will start expanding again because the
Reagan administration has determined the Chinese are not selling
Silkworm missiles to Iran.
   China also says it wants a commodity the United States is
sending to 64 other countries: Peace Corps volunteers.
   Under an agreement announced Wednesday at the conclusion of a
three-day visit by Chinese Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian, the United
States will lift a five-month suspension on liberalization of
high-tech products China is permitted to buy from American
companies.
   The restriction was imposed in October to protest what the
United States said was sale of Chinese Silkworm missiles used by
Iran to attack neutral shipping in the Persian Gulf.
   During his visit, Wu continued to deny that such sales were ever
made directly by China. Without commenting on that assertion, the
administration said it was satisfied with what the Chinese are
doing now.
   ``We are encouraged by Chinese statements and actions regarding
Iran's acquisition of Chinese anti-ship missiles, Silkworms,''
State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said.
   ``We have therefore decided to resume the export control
liberalization process for China,'' he said.
   This means experts from the state, commerce and defense
departments will resume reviewing the list of high-technology
products now banned for sale to China to see if any items can be
removed. Sales of high-technology products cleared for Chinese
purchase before last October have been continuing.
   Among the technologies that could be cleared for export to China
are computers, electronic components, communications gear and
metallurgical processes.
   The decision removed an irritant in the relationship. ``Clearly
they weren't happy about it, but we weren't happy about the
Silkworms,'' said a Reagan administration official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Wu also assured the United States that China would go along with
a United Nations resolution banning all arms sales to Iran, the
U.S. official said. According to U.S. estimates, China sold nearly
$1 billion worth of arms to Iran in 1987.
   Wu said at a National Press Club luncheon on Wednesday that U.S.
officials showed how upset they were about the Silkworms by raising
the issue 20 times during the three days of talks.
   He once again denied China ever sold weapons to Iran, but when
asked if Chinese weapons were getting to Iran through other
countries he said, ``We have no idea.''
   He gave an upbeat assessment of relations and called for more
trade and more people-to-people contacts between Chinese and
Americans. Then he revealed that after years of U.S. requests,
China had agreed in principle to accept Peace Corps volunteers.
   Since the program began in 1961 under President Kennedy, many
nations' feelings about Peace Corps projects have reflected their
overall view of relations with the United States.
   In India, for example, the largest country to have had Peace
Corps volunteers, the welcome mat was put out in 1962 when ties
were strong and was withdrawn in 1976, when relations soured. There
are now Peace Corps volunteers in 64 countries.
   The program in China is likely to concentrate on English
teaching, but further discussions will be needed to determine how
large the Peace Corps contingent will be and what it will do.
   ``It will be good news for our country and I believe for the
Chinese people if the Peace Corps can send its volunteers to the
most populous nation on earth,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn., who served as a volunteer in the Dominican Republic in the
1960s. ``We could learn much about each other.''
   Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs subcommittee on Asia called the Peace Corps agreement a
``potentially important step.''
   ``I feel confident that these ambassadors for the American way
of life will have a positive impact upon ties between the largest
nation in the East and the largest nation in the West,'' Solarz
said.
   Amid the good feeling they said was generated during the Wu
visit, U.S. officials had little comment on the issue of Tibet,
where Chinese authorities are clashing with groups seeking Tibetan
independence.
   Redman, the State Department spokesman, said Secretary of State
George P. Shultz raised the issue of human rights in Tibet, but
provided no details.
   In his press club remarks, Wu denounced a proposal by the Dalai
Lama, the religious leader of Tibetan Buddhists, who is living in
exile in India. The Dalai Lama's proposal includes a withdrawal of
Chinese troops from Tibet.
   Wu said of the Dalai Lama, ``He is an exile who attacks and
smears the People's Republic of China.''

   A four-year dispute over allegations the Army
was fraudulently overcharged for helicopter spare parts has been
resolved, with Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. agreeing to pay the
government about $88 million, the Army said today.
   The settlement, one of the largest ever in a defense contracting
case, grew out of findings by Pentagon auditors of numerous
accounting and inventory irregularities at the Fort Worth, Texas,
company, Pentagon sources said Wednesday night.
   Maj. Phil Soucy, an Army spokesman, today confirmed a settlement
had been reached and was scheduled to be signed on Friday. A
company statement said, ``We believe a settlement is in the
offing.''
   ``The Army is fully satisfied with this settlement and believes
it has recovered every dime out of this that we can get,'' said
Soucy.
   The Pentagon sources said that in reaching the settlement,
federal prosecutors had agreed to drop any potential criminal or
civil charges and that Bell Helicopter would not acknowledge any
wrongdoing.
   Soucy agreed there would be no further prosecution in the case,
but said the government had always hoped to strike a reasonable
settlement rather than go to trial because of the case's complexity.
   ``This was a very complex case that turned on a bad accounting
system (at Bell Helicopter) that was used in connection with
contracts worth billions of dollars,'' the spokesman said.
   Reached late Wednesday, Carl Harris, a Bell Helicopter
spokesman, read from a prepared statement which acknowledged there
had been ``settlement discussions.''
   ``We believe a settlement is in the offing,'' the statement
said. ``We are hopeful it will be soon. However, we are not able to
comment until a final agreement is reached. The terms that are
currently under discussion will not have a material effect on Bell
Helicopter Textron in 1988.''
   According to Soucy, the settlement will require Bell Helicopter
to pay $69 million directly to the U.S. Treasury within the next 30
days. The company also will have to allow the Army to assume
possession of any or all of a spare parts inventory valued at about
$11 million.
   In addition, Bell will forego claims to about $6 million worth
of interest on contract progress payments withheld by the Army and
about $1.5 million in legal fees. Offsetting that will be a $1.1
million payment by the Army to Bell to cover a separate contract
that got sidelined in the dispute.
   When a number of smaller provisions are added in, ``the final
value of this settlement is roughly $88 million,'' Soucy said.
   The spokesman said most of the overcharges came as a result of
an accounting problem that dealt with the handling of contracts
between 1983 and 1985. During the period, Bell switched to a
computerized accounting and inventory system that had the effect,
among other things, of accelerating the company's requests for Army
progress payments for work performed.
   Bell agreed to implement a new accounting system that met the
Army's approval in October 1985.
   The Defense Contract Audit Agency had originally identified
about $107 million in overcharges by Bell. Soucy said subsequent
investigation ``uncovered a number of overlapping amounts and
duplication in the books.''
   The overcharges never amounted to $107 million, Soucy said, but
he declined to estimate how much they did total.
   Soucy said the company had also agreed to implement a business
ethics program for its employees and to acknowledge ``our right to
audit their books and documents.''
   Bell Helicopter is a wholly owned subsidiary of Textron Inc., a
conglomerate based in Providence, R.I. In fiscal 1987, the parent
company ranked as the Pentagon's 18th largest contractor, with
$1.55 billion in defense work.
   Bell Helicopter holds contracts from the Army for such major
helicopter programs as the AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter, the UH-1
Iroquois utility helicopter and the OH-58D Kiowa light helicopter.
   A House committee is conducting its own investigation of the
case.

<HEAD>Workers To Decide Whether to Start Chrysler Contract Talks Early</HEAD>

   Early contract talks between Chrysler Corp. and
the United Auto Workers union could help the company and its
workers heal their recently-battered relationship, a labor expert
said.
   ``The fact that both sides appear to be pushing for it reflects
a desire for some stability,'' said Harley Shaiken, a labor and
technology expert at the University of California at San Diego.
   The UAW's 140-member national Chrysler bargaining council,
representing 71,700 workers at 49 local unions, was to meet here
today to decide whether to start talks as soon as next month.
   UAW President Owen Bieber, in Detroit to attend a conference on
aging work forces, said he would urge the council to agree to early
talks. But he declined to comment on possible establishment of an
earlier strike deadline to accompany early talks.
   Chrysler's three-year contract expires Sept. 14. Talks usually
begin in mid-summer, but Chrysler asked to start negotiations after
its failed attempt to sell its 28,000-worker Acustar Inc. parts
subsidiary.
   The No. 3 automaker last week canceled plans to sell Acustar
because of UAW opposition including threatened plant-by-plant
strikes that could have crippled production. Chrysler instead
decided to sell or close four Acustar plants within 18 months.
   In response to the Acustar proposal, workers also stopped
participating in union-management programs critical to improving
productivity and quality and have not returned because of
unresolved conflicts with the company, UAW leaders said.
   UAW Vice President Marc Stepp wanted the council to agree to
early talks, which local union leaders said Wednesday could help
prevent plant closures and movement of work by Chrysler to outside
companies or countries.
   ``I'm positive our membership would be 100 percent in favor of
that. As long as we're talking about jobs they would be more than
willing,'' said Local 1264 official Fred O'Brien at Chrysler's key
Sterling Heights stamping plant.
   Shaiken said an early settlement also would help Chrysler and
its workers put the Acustar conflict behind them ``and basically
settle into a pattern for the next few years.''
   A key issue in the decision was whether Chrysler also would
accept an early strike deadline or insist on a target deadline
without giving the union the right to strike if no settlement is
reached.
   UAW spokesman Peter Laarman said the union preferred ``to
actually start the clock'' rather than simply set an artificial
bargaining deadline.
   Chrysler chief negotiator Anthony St. John told The Detroit News
on Tuesday that the company did not want an early strike deadline,
but the company would not comment Wednesday.
   Chrysler eventually is expected to agree to the pattern contract
established last fall at Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp.
that includes job protection not included in Chrysler's present
contract.
   The GM and Ford contracts forbid layoffs except when production
falls because of slow sales, make it harder for the companies to
move production outside the company or country and forbid plant
closings that were not announced before talks started.
   O'Brien said going to the table early would limit the time
Chrysler has to announce further plant closings and make it easier
for the union to battle the possible closings of the four Acustar
plants.
   Chrysler buys the largest percentage of outside parts of any Big
Three maker _ 70 percent compared with 30 percent at GM and about
50 percent at Ford _ and O'Brien said workers want to prevent
further outsourcing.
   Stepp said he also wants the Ford profit-sharing formula in the
next contract. Ford workers Tuesday received profit-sharing checks
averaging more than $3,700 from Ford's industry-record 1987 profits
of $4.6 billion.
   Chrysler has no profit-sharing plan.

<HEAD>Wisconsin Union Local Appeals to Iacocca with Roadside Billboard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMTRAMCK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Auto Workers union members in
Kenosha, Wis., have rented a billboard in this Detroit enclave to
ask Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca to keep their plant open
and save their jobs.
   Chrysler has announced it will close the former American Motors
Corp. car assembly plant in Kenosha at the end of the 1988 model
year, eliminating 5,500 jobs. Chrysler acquired the plant when it
bought AMC last year.
   The billboard, located along Interstate 75 in Hamtramck, says:
```Iacocca, keep your word to Kenosha!' UAW Local 72 Kenosha.''
   The UAW and Wisconsin officials contend Chrysler promised to
modernize the plant and keep it open for five years of making Dodge
Omni and Plymouth Horizon subcompacts. Chrysler denies it gave any
guarantees.
   ``We hope this will generate interest and motivate Iacocca to
change his mind,'' said Rudy Kuzel, spokesman for Local 72.
   The local paid $4,200 for one month's rent on the sign, which is
a few blocks from Chrysler headquarters in Highland Park.
   ``We will not crawl off in a corner,'' Kuzel said Wednesday.
``They want us to lie down, play dead and wait to see how we are
going to be buried.''
   Top Chrysler and UAW leaders met in Milwaukee on Wednesday to
discuss the Kenosha plant and benefits for workers should it close.
Unlike other Chrysler workers, those at Kenosha and other former
AMC plants aren't covered by the supplemental unemployment benefits
provision of the Chrysler-UAW contract.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Removes Stays on Order to Release Mulheren From MCC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court today lifted a stay that
had prevented the arbitrageur accused of threatening to kill Ivan
Boesky from leaving federal detention and moving into a private
psychiatric hospital.
   The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals denied the government's motion for
a continuation of a stay. The effect is to allow John Mulheren to
be moved to the private hospital.
   U.S. District Judge Whitman Knapp had ruled Wednesday that a
three-hour examination by a court-appointed psychiatrist indicated
that Mulheren presented no threat to either himself or the
community and released him from the Metropolitan Correctional
Center.
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Gage said he opposed
releasing Mulheren to the private hospital, and obtained a ruling
from the 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals staying the matter until today's
ruling.
   The government had argued that the private facility, the Carrier
Foundation in Montgomery Township, N.J., was not secure enough to
house Mulheren, the senior partner at Jamie Securities Co.
   However, Knapp said, ``He's no danger at the moment, and if he's
kept under proper surveillance there's no reason to believe he will
become dangerous.''
   Mulheren, carrying a loaded assault rifle, was arrested Feb. 18
by the police outside his Rumson, N.J., home.
   He is being held on a criminal complaint that he threatened to
kill admitted insider-trader Boesky and Michael Davidoff, Boesky's
former head trader. The men have reportedly implicated Mulheren in
possible securities law violations.
   Mulheren's lawyers argue that he is a manic depressive who had
failed to take his Lithium, a drug used to control impulses, the
day of his arrest.
   Knapp said he could not explain Mulheren's actions, but agreed
with the psychiatrist that they were an ``aberration.''
   One of his defense lawyers, Peter Bennett, said Wednesday that
Mulheren had not been getting the drug properly while in federal
custody.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Open Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices opened mixed
today on the Chicago Board of Trade, with soybeans posting some
surprising gains in early trading.
   Market analysts had expected soybeans to open lower on ideas
that soybean plantings were on the rise and in response to an
increase in the Agriculture Department's estimate of this year's
ending stocks.
   Instead, soybean futures were as much as 3 cents a bushel higher
in early trading.
   ``It's a little bit of a surprise that some buying came into the
soybean market but I don't think it's anything too significant
because the market's starting to back off already,'' Ted Mao, grain
specialist for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said about a half-hour
after the opening.
   Wheat futures were steady to slightly higher. Corn prices were
mostly lower.
   In early trading, wheat was \ cent to 1\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $2.96 a bushel; corn was { cent
lower to } cent higher with March at $1.99{ a bushel; oats were
unchanged to } cent higher with March at $1.85 a bushel; soybeans
were { cent to 3 cents higher with March at $6.08{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were mostly lower
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .15 cent higher with April at
72.97 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .18 cent
higher with March at 81.20 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent to .25
cent lower with April at 43.37 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were unchanged to .17 cent lower with March at 52.10 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures closed mostly lower on Wednesday.

<HEAD>Lorimar Gets Unsolicited Bid from Marvin Davis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CULVER CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Loss-plagued Lorimar Telepictures
Corp., which earlier this week said it was discussing a merger with
Warner Communications Inc., said today it has received an
unsolicited $780.3 million takeover bid from investor Marvin Davis.
   The $17-a-share price being offered by Davis is in the middle of
the $14 to $20 range that analysts have said Lorimar should be able
to fetch and was seen as triggering a bidding war for Lorimar.
   Lorimar stock jumped $1.37{ a share to $15.75 in early trading
after announcement of the offer from Davis. The company has 45.9
million shares outstanding.
   It hasn't been disclosed what sort of terms are being discussed
in talks between Lorimar and New York-based Warner. Those talks,
which began last weekend, have been described by both sides as
preliminary.
   Davis has been seeking to get back into the entertainment
business since selling 20th Century Fox Film Corp. to media magnate
Rupert Murdoch in 1985 for $575 million. Davis had owned Fox for
four years, but the company was beset by persistent losses.
   Last year, he made an unsuccessful $321.9 million bid for the
90.6 percent he didn't already own of Texas-based Spectradyne Inc.,
the nation's largest supplier of cable television and pay-per-view
movies for hotels.
   In a brief announcement, Lorimar noted that Davis' offer was
subject to a number of conditions and said it ``would bear Davis'
letter in mind.''
   Lorimar is a leading producer of original television
programming, but in recent years it has been troubled as its
ambitious plans to expand into other areas disintegrated and
sometimes caused the company to incur losses or heavy costs that
depressed earnings.
   For the first nine months of its current fiscal year, Lorimar
posted a loss of $82.6 million on revenue of $616.8 million. The
deficit included $45 million in writedowns on five movies and $22
million in reserves for possible future losses in its home-video
unit.
   Management of both the movie and home-video units have been
replaced.
   For fiscal 1987 ended last March 31, the company lost $58.6
million, mostly because of restructuring costs, on revenue of
$766.2 million.

<HEAD>Shareholders File Suit Against Lorimar Telepictures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four disgruntled shareholders filed a
class-action lawsuit against Lorimar Telepictures Corp. alleging
the company overstated its income and net worth, causing investors
to pay more for stock.
   The federal suit filed Wednesday also alleges that Lorimar
misled investors to believe that problems in the company's
videocassette division were cleared up and would cause no further
financial problems, the suit said.
   Lorimar spokeswoman Sue Binford said there would be no comment
because company officials have not yet seen the suit.
   Last June, Lorimar reported in a letter to shareholders that the
company had suffered substantial losses of $31.5 million, but said
the problems in the videocassette division were resolved, the suit
alleged.
   However, a recent company announcement indicated that additional
problems in the videocassette division could cost another $22
million, the suit said.
   The suit, which asks for general damages, seeks to represent an
estimated hundreds of thousands of shareholders who traded on 30
million shares between Aug. 14, 1986, and Feb. 12 of this year.
   The plaintiffs, all from Westchester County, N.Y., are
identified as Ted Streit, Eli Berman, Shirley Sichel, and Louis
Haber. They bought Lorimar stock between September 1987 and
December 1987.
   Earlier this week, Lorimar said it is discussing the possibility
of being acquired by Warner Communications Inc. That information
sent the firm's stock price up $2.50 a share to $15.
   And Lorimar said today it has received an unsolicited $780.3
million takeover bid from investor Marvin Davis.
   The Culver City-based company was formed in February 1986 by the
stock-swap combination of Lorimar Inc., best known as the producer
of ``Dallas'' and ``Knot's Landing,'' and New York-based
Telepictures Corp., which made most of its revenue from animated
shows and other programs such as ``People's Court.''
   The company is producing 12 hours of prime-time shows for the
1987-88 television season, including ``Mama's Family,'' ``It's a
Living'' and ``She's the Sheriff.''

<HEAD>More House For The Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Getting more house for the money has been the
perennial goal of young couples, and many of them may have achieved
it _ in a relatively unpublicized way.
   The statistical evidence of the phenomenon is overwhelming. And
visual proof also is available from a stroll through certain
neighborhoods in almost every city and town in the nation.
   First-home buyers have used the technique. So have homeowners
who found ``move-up'' houses priced beyond reach. And so also have
thousands of people who discovered that their own hands were the
most useful tools ever made.
   What all these people have done is enlarge existing homes to
meet their needs rather than purchase larger homes. In so doing,
some have saved more money than they ever could have accumulated in
a savings account.
   In many instances, additions exceed the original.
   Statistics add documentation. In 1977, additions and alterations
amounted to $14.2 billion nationwide; in 1987, the total exceeded
$40 billion. In 1977, major replacement expenditures ran $5.7
billion, but triple that in 1987.
   Between 1980 and 1986, according to the National Association of
Home Builders, remodeling activity increased 117 percent, and often
became the major occupation of companies that once considered
themselves new-home builders.
   One of the major factors in such activity is the soaring price
of land, especially as a percentage of the total price.
   Land accounted for only 11 percent of the total cost of a
single-family home in 1949. But those were the good old days. By
1969 the percentage had jumped to 21, and by 1986 to 25.
   Meanwhile, the relative cost of labor and materials has been
shrinking, from 69 percent in 1949 to 55 percent in 1969 to 47
percent in 1986.
   Land costs, therefore, are something to be avoided by
budget-conscious homebuyers. Inevitably, the latest prices for land
are included in the pricing of new homes, since builders must cover
their costs or go broke.
   It isn't quite the same in an established neighborhood, where
new buyers sometimes find sellers aren't quite as sensitive to the
prices of lots. And smart buyers know that a small house at a low
price can be doubled in size.
   Existing homeowners seeking larger homes are also recognizing
the same factors. It's an old story. After weeks of examining
prices of newer houses, in which latest land prices are
incorporated, they decide to enlarge their existing home.
   Aiding these homeowners is the ease with which funds can be
obtained for renovations, especially through home equity loans,
often at rates lower than they would have paid for a new-home
mortgage.
   A warning to those seeking existing homes with the idea of
adding on: Make certain beforehand that you are free from zoning or
other problems. In many areas, for example, home size is limited to
a small percentage of lot size.

<HEAD>Japan's Trade Surplus With United States Shrinks Declines 26.5
Percent In February</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's unadjusted trade surplus with the United
States fell 14.4 percent in February as imports from the United
States reached record levels, the Finance Ministry said Thursday.
   The politically sensitive surplus was squeezed by the strong
Japanese yen, which makes it cheap for the Japanese to buy
foreign-made goods and inhibits sales of Japanese goods abroad.
   The Japanese-U.S. surplus fell to $3.40 billion from $3.97
billion in February 1987, unadjusted for seasonal fluctuations.
Exports to the United States rose 9.7 percent to $6.81 billion,
while imports from the United States soared by 51.9 percent to
$3.41 billion.
   The imports from the United States broke the previous one-month
record of $3.12 billion, set in June 1986.
   Japan's overall trade surplus declined 26.5 percent in February
as imports of foreign goods set another record, the ministry said.
   The overall surplus fell to $5.24 billion from $7.13 billion in
February 1987, the 10th consecutive month of year-to-year declines.
   The February surplus was up from $3.07 billion in January, but
the ministry said the scope of trade usually dwindles in January
because of Japan's long New Year holidays.
   Imports shot up 48.0 percent from a year ago to a record $15.0
billion in February, while exports rose 17.2 percent to $20.2
billion. The previous high for imports was $14.8 billion in
December 1987.
   Imports of U.S. aircraft in the month nearly tripled to $478
million.
   The ministry said the aircraft purchases were a special factor
in February, but over the last several months, export growth has
been held back and imports have been encouraged by the yen's sharp
rise against the U.S. dollar. The dollar was trading at 128 yen in
February, compared with 152 yen a year earlier.
   Meanwhile, machinery imports from the United States in February
grew by 77.9 percent to $1.26 billion and motor vehicle imports
rose 91.6 percent to $15.6 million.
   Japanese motor vehicle exports to the United States fell 5.4
percent to $1.71 billion.
   Japan ran a February trade surplus of $1.94 billion with the
European Economic Community, up by $4 million from a year earlier.
   Because of large oil imports, Japan's deficit in trade with the
Middle East rose to $1.20 billion from $844 million in February
1987.

<HEAD>K Mart Earnings Up; Dayton Hudson's Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   K mart Corp. reported Thursday its fourth-quarter earnings rose
nearly 13 percent while Dayton Hudson Corp. said its income fell
from a year earlier, when it had a one-time gain from the sale of
one of its divisions.
   K mart, the nation's second-largest retailer, said it earned
$321.2 million, or $1.58 a share, in the quarter ended Jan. 27,
compared with $285 million, or $1.41 a share, in the same period a
year earlier.
   Sales for the quarter totaled $7.75 billion, up from $7.23
billion in the year-earlier quarter.
   For all of fiscal 1987, K mart earned $692.2 million, or $3.40 a
share, up 19 percent from the $582.3 million, or $2.90 a share, the
company recorded in 1986.
   The retailer's full-year sales totaled $25.6 billion, up from
$23.8 billion the previous year.
   ``K mart had good, solid earnings improvement because of
effective control of their business,'' said Jeffrey B. Edelman, a
retail industry analyst for the investment firm Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. ``Markdowns were held to a minimum.''
   Dayton Hudson, the nation's sixth-largest retailer, said it
earned $133.7 million, or $1.54 a share, in the quarter ended Jan.
30, down 34 percent from $202.4 million, or $2.08 a share, in the
year-earlier period.
   However, the 1986 fourth quarter included an $85.2 million gain
from the sale of Dayton Hudson's B. Dalton Booksellers chain.
Excluding that gain, Dayton Hudson's earnings rose 11 percent in
the latest quarter.
   Dayton Hudson's fourth-quarter figures reflect ``some positive
earnings swings from a division that had been very depressed last
year,'' said Edelman.
   Edelman referred to the company's Mervyn's apparel stores, which
had helped pull Dayton Hudson's earnings into a decline in recent
quarters.
   Sales for the latest quarter totaled $3.68 billion, up from
$3.12 billion in the year-earlier quarter.
   For all of fiscal 1987, Dayton Hudson earned $228.4 million, or
$2.41 a share, down 26 percent from $310 million, or $3.19 a share,
in 1986.
   Excluding the fourth-quarter 1986 gain, the retailer's earnings
fell 10 percent.
   Full-year sales totaled $10.68 billion, up from $9.26 billion.
   Dayton Hudson said its Target discount stores division continued
to do well in 1987, but its department stores suffered from a drop
in sales.
   Edelman said both companies benefited from lower tax rates in
1987.
   Meanwhile, Charming Shoppes Inc. reported its fourth-quarter
income plummeted 46 percent as its sales declined along with those
of many other apparel retailers.
   Charming Shoppes said it earned $7.5 million, or 15 cents a
share, in the quarter ended Jan. 30, down from nearly $14 billion,
or 28 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
   Sales rose to $182.9 million from $163.8 million.
   Many apparel retailers have seen their fourth-quarter profits
tumble because they were forced to slash prices in the face of
sluggish sales. Analysts said consumers were bored by the fall and
winter fashions in most stores.
   For the full year, Charming Shoppes said it earned $42.6
million, up 5 percent from $40.5 million in 1986. Sales totaled
$638.6 million in fiscal 1987, up from $521.2 million the year
before.
   Charming Shoppes operates 840 stores in 33 states under the
names Fashion Bug and Fashion Bug Plus.
   K mart, the nation's second-largest retailer, said it had 3,934
stores at the year's end, including K mart, Waldenbooks, Builders
Square and Pay Less Drug stores.
   Besides Mervyn's and Target, Dayton Hudson's divisions include
Dayton Hudson Department Stores and Lechmere's home electronics,
appliance and sporting goods stores.
   The company had a total of 577 stores at year's end.

<TEXT>
   More than 2.4 million jobs are expected to be
created in the United States this year, fewer than in 1987 but
``still a very healthy number,'' a business research company said
Thursday.
   Manufacturers and companies with fewer than 20 employees will
again be leaders in creating jobs, according to Dun & Bradstreet
Corp., which announced the results of its annual survey of
employment expectations at 5,000 companies.
   Last year, the U.S. economy created about 3 million jobs. The
Labor Department announced last week that the nation's civilian
unemployment rate fell to 5.7 percent in February, its lowest point
since 1979.
   Dun & Bradstreet has predicted in a separate report that the
jobless rate will average 5.7 percent this year, down from an
average of 6.2 percent last year. The new jobs will be filled by
new entrants to the labor force.
   The goods-producing sector, aided by a cheaper dollar, is likely
to produce more than 610,000 jobs this year, the most since 1979,
Dun & Bradstreet said.
   In contrast, the goods-producing sector lost 180,000 jobs in
1986, and then added 210,000 last year as it began to recover, the
company said.
   ``This represents a significant departure from the pattern in
recent years, when job growth was driven largely by the services
sector,'' Joseph W. Duncan, the chief economist, said in a news
release.
   ``The hot spot, so to speak, in 1988 is going to be the
industrial Midwest,'' Reid Gearhart, a Dun & Bradstreet analyst,
said in an interview.
   Companies with fewer than 20 employees are expected to generate
35 percent of the new jobs in 1988, even though they make up less
than 19 percent of total employment, the company said.
   Similarly, it said, companies with fewer than 100 employees are
likely to generate just over half of the new jobs in spite of
making up only a third of the employment.
   Companies with over 25,000 employees are likely to lag again in
1988, contributing slightly less than 7 percent of new jobs in
spite of making up 20 percent of employment, Dun & Bradstreet said.
   Just over 32 percent of manufacturers in the survey said they
expected to increase employment, the highest of any sector. The
corresponding figures in other sectors were 12.8 percent in
agriculture, 27.8 percent in mining, 31.3 percent in construction,
27.5 percent in transportation and public utilities, 30.1 percent
in wholesale and retail trade, 25.7 percent in finance, insurance
and real estate, 31.5 percent in services and 25.5 percent in
government.

   The stock market took a tumble today, giving
back some of its recent gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 22.05 to
2,052.22 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 3 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 556 up, 962 down and
441 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders were disappointed by the Dow Jones
industrial average's inability to make a run at the 2,100 level
after reaching new early-1988 highs lately.
   Investors evidently are skeptical about the market's ability to
put together a sustained rally less than six months after the
October crash.
   Those traders who have been buying are quick to step in and take
profits when prices move up, brokers say.
   A good many market participants are already looking ahead to
next week's scheduled monthly report on the trade deficit, trying
to figure out whether the figures are likely to maintain the
favorable trend of the past couple of reports.
   Today Japan said its trade surplus fell in February from its
comparable level a year ago.
   Colt Industries led the active list and jumped 4{ to 17}. The
company said it agreed to be acquired by a group including its top
executives for $17 a share.
   AFG Industries fell 5 to 31|. Forstmann Little & Co. said it had
decided after studying the matter not to make an offer to acquire
AFG.
   K mart gained ] to 35\. The company reported earnings for its
fiscal fourth quarter ended Jan. 27 of $1.58 a share, up from $1.41
in the like period a year earlier.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.97 to 150.51. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 1.99 at 297.59.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 148.47 million shares with an
hour to go.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures closed moderately lower
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade as traders showed little
buying interest.
   Of overriding concern was an expectation that a March 31
government report on spring plantings will show a broad increase in
crop acreage, said Ted Mao, grain specialist with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc.
   Other maret pressures include the large soybean crop now being
harvested in South America, an increase in world vegetable-oil
production and the lackluster prospects for new grain export sales
to the Soviet Union in the near term, Mao said.
   ``It's a combination of all that in the atmosphere of a market
that's been kind of on the defensive and it's just feeding on
itself temporarily,'' Mao said.
   At the close, wheat was 3} cents to 6\ cents lower with the

<HEAD>De Benedetti Calls for Societe Generale Shareholders Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAF CASERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italian investor Carlo De Benedetti,
who is vying for control of Belgium's biggest holding company,
Thursday called for an extraordinary meeting of the shareholders of
Societe Generale de Belgique S.A.
   De Benedetti said he would ask the meeting to consider himself
and two of his Belgian allies, Andre Leysen of Gevaert N.V and
Pierre Scohier of Copeba S.A, as company directors.
   De Benedetti and an array of Belgian and international partners
claim to control over 47 percent of the company's 28.2 million
shares.
   A Franco-Belgian alliance is fighting De Benedetti's bid to get
control of Societe Generale and claims a majority stake of 52
percent.
   The group formed around Belgium's biggest insurer, Group AG, and
the French investment firm Companie Financiere de Suez, has also
said it would like a shareholders meeting to discuss the company's
future but has not called for a specific date.
   In addition, it stressed it is willing to talk with De
Benedetti, but only on the condition that the Italian admits he
does not have control of the company.
   While the uncertainty on the corporate battle continued, Suez
president Renaud de la Geniere said the fight ``could take months
perhaps, but I hope I will not take years.''
   De la Geniere had talks with caretaker Prime Minister Wilfried
Martens on the takeover bid, but no details were available.
   In a statement released by his French investment company Cerus
S.A, de Benedetti said the shareholders meeting should discuss how
many directors should run the company, which controls a third of
the Belgian economy.
   Any shareholder with at least 20 percent of the share capital is
able to convene such a meeting according to Belgian commercial law.
   The stakes each side holds could change dramatically since a
Brussels court approved a capital increase of 12 million shares for
Societe Generale. Both camps claim they are entitled to the new
stock. A higher court still has to rule on the increase.
   To sidestep the issue, De Benedetti announced a request would be
made at the meeting that the company not make use of its recent
capital increase.
   Leysen said de la Geniere had made similar suggestions earlier
and said the two sides might agree to annul the capital increase.
   The shares were issued by Societe Generale immediately after it
was aware of De Benedetti's intentions, which it considers hostile.
The increase would dilute the stakes each side currently holds.
   De Benedetti wants to turn the 166-year-old company into a
holding company for enterprises across Europe, anticipating 1992,
when the movement of goods, capital and people should be free
throughout the 12-nation European Economic Community.
   The alliance fighting De Benedetti wants the company to remained
focused in Belgium.

<HEAD>Southdown Inc. Increases Tender Offer For Moore McCormack
Resources, Inc.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southdown Inc., a cement and energy company, says
it is increasing its tender offer for Moore McCormack Resources
Inc. to $35 per share of common stock from its previous offer of
$31 per share.
   The increase was estimated to raise the total value of the
takeover to about $450 million from a previous estimate of roughly
$395 million, including offers for Moore McCormack preferred stock
and subordinated debt, Southdown officials said Thursday.
   ``We will consider this development in due course,'' said Tony
Doumlele, director of corporate relations for Moore McCormack.
   On March 23, Southdown announced its initial cash tender offer
for the Stamford, Conn.-based oil and gas and building materials
company. At the time, Moore McCormack officials called th offer
``totally unsolicited,'' but said they would study it.
   ``We haven't heard anything more (from Moore McCormack
management),'' said Ruth Pachman, spokeswoman for Southdown.
   Southdown said its tender offer is conditional upon the valid
tender of a majority of Moore McCormack common stock, the
invalidation of Moore McCormack's ``poison pill'' anti-takeover
defense and the acquisition of sufficient financing.
   Southdown said it was confident it could obtain the necessary
financing to cover the tender offer and related costs.
   Southdown produces and sells cement and ready-mixed concrete and
is active in oil and gas production. Moore McCormack produces
building materials and is involved in oil and gas exploration and
production, mainly in Texas and Louisiana.

<HEAD>Stockyards Sales Reports Headed For Last Roundup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After almost 70 years of tallying
livestock sales at the historic pens of the Fort Worth Stockyards,
the Livestock Market News Service said its reports are headed for
their last roundup.
   Government officials have issued daily or weekly reports on
sales at the pens since around 1920, but said Wednesday that so few
cattle and hogs are sold in the city still nicknamed Cowtown that
regular sales reports will be halted March 31.
   The oldest cattle pens in Fort Worth date to 1887. But as urban
growth has swallowed the stockyards, cattle raisers have turned
away from the maze of traffic lights and freeways to competing
auctions in small towns, said Rick Wahrmund, statewide director of
the Livestock Market News Service.
   Ronnie Steen, who has been reporting stockyard sales since 1976,
said sales have dropped to between 200 and 300 cattle a week for
months, from an average of about 5,000 weekly in 1976. Daily
auctions have long since been replaced with a weekly cattle auction
on Mondays.
   ``We don't have enough cattle to know what the market is,''
Steen said. Sales volumes of at least 500 are needed to establish
clear market trends for farmers, ranchers and others who use the
information.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture began issuing daily livestock
reports from the Fort Worth Stockyards around 1920, when annual
sales regularly topped 6 million cattle, 1 million hogs and 400,000
sheep.

<HEAD>Biggest Retailer Makes Move to Thwart Corporate Raiders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retailing giant GB-INNO-BM S.A., one of
Belgium's biggest companies, proclaimed a ``poison pill'' takeover
defense Thursday to thwart potentially hostile acquirers.
   The company said it issued new bonds with warrants to five
friendly companies, which if fully exercised would create 6.1
million new shares, inflating the total shares outstanding by
nearly 20 percent to 37.1 million shares. This would make it
difficult for a hostile bidder to buy the retailer.
   Its stock value soared 51 percent last week on rumors that a
takeover bid might be imminent.
   Since Belgium does not have any disclosure rules for investors
in publicly traded companies, it was not clear whether a takeover
might be planned.
   The company said it knew of no parties interested in acquiring
it, but undertook the takeover defense in the interest of
protecting shareholder value and supporting management policies. It
said the unusual movement of the shares in recent days had
``created uncertainty.''
   The move by GB-INNO-BM came against a background of sudden
management uncertainty caused by a hostile takeover fight
surrounding Belgium's biggest company, Societe Generale de Belgique
S.A. Italian investor Carlo De Benedetti has been vying for control
of Societe Generale.

<TEXT>
   A unit of Pirelli SpA arranged a $2.3 billion
credit line Thursday through SBCI Swiss Bank Corp. to finance its
takeover bid for Firestone Tire and Rubber Co., SBCI said.
   Veere Inc., a unit of Pirelli and Pirelli Societe Internationale
SA, will use $1.93 billion dollars to finance the $58
dollar-a-share bid for the U.S. tire maker, the bank said.
   The bid by the Milan-based tire maker was announced Monday after
being rumored for more than a week.
   The remainder of the credit line will go to refinance ``certain
obligations of Firestone,'' the bank said. It did not elaborate.
   The bank also did not state the terms of the credit facility,
which is being fully underwritten by Swiss Bank Corp. and Credit
Suisse.
   Pirelli has said it will spin off part of Firestone to France's
Michelin & Co. But Pirelli's offer was made after Firestone already
had agreed to sell its tire business to Japan's Bridgestone Corp.
for about $1.25 billion by setting up a joint venture that would
give the Japanese company a 75 percent stake in Firestone's
factories and retail network.
   Analysts have said they expect Bridgestone to make a counter
offer.

   The stock market fell sharply today, giving back
some of the gains from its early-1988 rally.
   Analysts said traders were disappointed by the Dow Jones
industrial average's inability to make a run at the 2,100 level
after reaching new highs for the year on Tuesday.
   Investors evidently are skeptical about the market's ability to
put together a sustained rally less than six months after the
October crash.
   Those traders who have been buying are quick to step in and take
profits when prices move up, brokers say.
   A good many market participants are already looking ahead to
next week's scheduled monthly report on the trade deficit, trying
to figure out whether the figures are likely to maintain the
favorable trend of the past couple of reports.
   Today Japan said its trade surplus fell in February from its
comparable level a year ago.

<HEAD>Screwdriver Connection: Seagram Buying Tropicana</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canadian liquor giant Seagram Co. Ltd. proposed
the ultimate in mixed drinks Thursday, announcing it will buy
orange juice producer Tropicana Products Inc. for $1.2 billion to
expand Seagram's share of the beverage market.
   The Canadian liquor-and-beverage giant's acquisition of
Tropicana from Beatrice U.S. Food Corp. marks a ``diversification
and an expansion'' of Seagram's product line, Seagram Chairman
Edgar M. Bronfman said in a statement.
   Securities analysts said the move into the orange juice business
was a logical step for Seagram, which has limited growth potential
through its liquor products.
   The purchase _ made throught the company's U.S. subsidiary,
Joseph E. Seagram & Sons Inc. _ will be financed initially with a
combination of bank loans and short-term borrowings, Seagram said.
   Montreal-based Seagram, best known for its distilled spirits and
wines, has in recent years moved into the manufacturing of wine
coolers and sells cocktail mixers such as tonic, seltzer and ginger
ale under the Seagram's name.
   Seagram is also in the process of acquiring French cognac
producer Martell & Co. in a deal valued at $930 million.
   ``We have already broadened our base with Seagram's (wine)
coolers and Tropicana is another step in this direction,'' Bronfman
said.
   Tropicana, with headquarters in Bradenton, Fla., is a well-known
fruit juice and beverage manufacturer and distributor. It had sales
of about $750 million in its last fiscal year, which ended Feb. 29,
said Marcelline Thomson, a Seagram spokeswoman in New York.
   Tropicana is a leading producer of both ready-to-serve orange
juice and frozen concentrate.
   ``It's a good fit,'' said Robert S. Reitzes, who tracks Seagram
for the investment firm Mabon, Nugent & Co. in New York. ``It makes
sense in their business.''
   Ian Osler, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in
Toronto, agreed, saying orange juice is not that different from
Seagram's current businesses.
   ``They understand the business and it's growing, unlike most of
their liquor products,'' Osler said.
   Reitzes said it was possible Seagram would use the Tropicana
name to introduce new products.
   Seagram had net income of nearly $423.5 billion on sales of $3.3
billion in the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 1987, and reported a
profit of more than $402.4 million on sales of $2.6 billion for the
nine months ending Oct. 31, Ms. Thomson said.
   Beatrice U.S. Food Corp., based in Chicago, is a division of
closely-held Beatrice Co., which put itself up for sale last
September.
   Beatrice Chairman Donald Kelly had hoped to sell the company as
a whole, but could not find a buyer at his asking price, reportedly
$4.5 billion.
   Beatrice spokesman Charles Long said the company also is
considering selling its Hunt's tomato products and Wesson oils
lines.
   Beatrice also owns the meat company Swift-Ekrich Inc., Peter Pan
peanut butter and Orville Redenbacher popcorn.
   The company's predecessor, Beatrice Cos., was taken private in
1986 in a $6.2 billion leveraged buyout led by Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts & Co.
   A number of Beatrice Cos.' assets, including Avis car rental and
International Playtex Inc. personal products, were sold off, and
others were spun off as E-II Holdings Inc.
   E-II agreed last month to be taken over by American Brands Inc.

   Share prices rose sharply on the London Stock
Exchange Thursday after Britain's top Treasury official, Chancellor
of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, said a further steep rise in the
pound against the West German mark could not be sustained.
   Trading was heavy in selected stocks, with oil shares setting a
fast pace on good gains in crude oil prices.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 19.3 points at 1,834.6.
   The pound surged on world currency markets Monday and Tuesday
after the Bank of England stopped selling pounds to prevent the
British currency from rising too sharply. The pound retreated
Wednesday and Thursday when the central bank renewed its pound
sales.
   Lawson's comments in Parliament calmed fears that a strong
pound, which increases the price of exports, would make British
companies less competitive, dealers said.
   They said there was a general feeling in the market that the
British government will not let the pound go much above 3.10 marks
without taking steps to halt the rise.
   The pound fell in late trading to 3.06 marks from 3.08 marks
late Wednesday.

   Assets of the nation's 240 money market mutual
funds rose $1.41 billion in the latest week, setting a record, the
Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to $280.06 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $1.37 billion drop in the funds' assets the
previous week to a revised $278.65 billion, according to the
Washington-based mutual fund trade group.
   The funds' assets previous record high was $280.02 billion in
the week ended Feb. 24.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 210 general purpose funds fell $306.5 million to $81.50
billion, assets of 97 broker-dealer funds rose $1.29 billion to
$116.39 billion, and assets of 113 institutional funds rose $423.7
million to $82.17 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 6.05 percent from 6.10 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 6.12 percent from 6.17 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
43 days, down from 45 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts fell to
5.73 percent as of Wednesday from 5.74 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, remained unchanged at 5.17 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 6.83
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 6.85
percent the previous week. Yields were 7.15 percent on 1-year CDs,
down from 7.16 percent; 7.55 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 7.57
percent; and 8.02 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.04 percent.

<HEAD>Another Talent Strike Looms As Actors Vote Strike Authorization</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD DE ATLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A joint board of directors for Hollywood's
two top acting unions voted to authorize a strike for March 21
against television and radio advertisers, with cable television
residuals a top sticking point.
   The vote by the directors for the Screen Actors Guild and the
American Federation of Radio and Television Artists came late
Wednesday, actors guild spokesman Mark Locher said Thursday.
   In 1987, actors were paid about $400 million for radio and
television commercials, according to advertisers. The unions said
the members earned $520 million.
   ``It's our bread-and-butter contract,'' said Locher. ``It
certainly means survival to most actors between jobs.''
   If actors strike it will be the second labor action by a
Hollywood talent union this month. The Writers Guild of America
struck studios and producers on Sunday.
   In New York, chief advertising group negotiator John McGuinn
warned Thursday that a strike could last as long as six months, and
urged advertisers to resist signing any interim agreements with the
unions. McGuinn made his comments at a television advertising
seminar.
   Talks between SAG-AFTRA and the Joint Policy Committee of the
American Association of Advertising Agencies and the Association of
National Advertisers have been held in Manhattan. The two
management agencies represent 400 advertisers and about 300
agencies, spokeswoman Dorothy Forget said.
   Negotiations for a new three-year contract began January 11,
with the old contract expiring on Feb. 6. The joint union
membership voted 93 percent for a strike authorization on March 2,
and talks broke off on March 7.
   The joint SAG-AFTRA membership is more than 100,000. The unions
negotiate jointly on the issue of commercials.
   Advertising negotiator McGuinn and guild national executive
secretary Ken Orsatti, the chief bargaining agent for the actors,
both cited the matter of residuals from commercials shown on cable
television as one unresolved point.
   Actors currently receive no residuals from cable television
showings of their commercials after they have earned their first
$1,000 in payments from showings on regular, prime-time television.
   Orsatti noted that virtually all commercials chosen for cable
television have met the $1,000 requirement.
   Orsatti also said advertisers want to take away the 10-year-old
cost of living clause in the commercial contract. He said a cost of
living raise has been the only kind of increase actors have had in
the last two contracts.
   Deteriorating viewership of network television over the past six
years has kept other commercial residual increases in check,
Orsatti said.
   ``Management has used the argument that the erosion in the
network area was caused by cable,'' Orsatti said, ``but they are
unwilling to consider any formula which restructures cable payments
so that the performer has an opportunity to somewhat make up for
those dollars lost on the network side.''
   Orsatti said the union wants to negotiate actors' payments for
commercials shown on cable TV based on subscribers, wit an actor
receiving a one-day session fee of $333 for the first 20 million
subscribers, and another session fee for each additional 30 million
subscribers thereafter.
   McGuinn said the advertisers offered to pay one session fee for
13 weeks of cable use, regardless of any previous use of the
commercial on broadcast newtorks. He said the union's proposal
would be too costly.
   Orsatti said several formulas have been discussed.

   Union members on Thursday accused Eastern
Airline's parent company of trying to financially cripple the air
carrier to win wage concessions.
   ``The primary focus of our new management seems to have strayed
from safety to cutting operating costs,'' Eastern pilot John
Knudson told a rally of 1,500 union members and supporters.
   Union representatives said Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's
parent Texas Air Corp., has stripped Eastern of valuable assets and
has hired Merrill Lynch to amass a $200 million strike fund.
   Under Lorenzo, Eastern management also has asked pilots to fly
in unsafe conditions and has harassed flight attendants, union
officials said.
   A three-year contract with the airline's 12,000 members of the
Machinists union expired at the end of December. Negotiations have
failed to produce a new agreement and the issues are now in federal
mediation.
   Lorenzo purchased the Miami-based airline in 1986. Giant Texas
Air also owns Continental Airlines, People Express, New York Air
and other aviation subsidiaries.
   ``These management practices of Frank Lorenzo are in direct
contrast to the policies of the other six major carriers, and they
will spread like a cancer to the rest of the industry if they are
ignored now,'' Knudson said.
   Paula Musto, a spokeswoman for Eastern, said the rally was a
union attempt to gain public support during contract negotiations.
   ``We feel that it's public grandstanding while we're in the
midst of contract negotiations with our largest union,'' Ms. Musto
said.
   Protesters, who rallied a block from the Philadelphia offices of
Eastern and Merrill Lynch, said they did not want boycotts of
either company but wanted to raise public awareness about what they
called union-busting practices.
   Demonstrations will be scheduled in other cities, including
Houston, Denver and Los Angeles, said Joseph B. Uehlein, an AFL-CIO
official who is coordinating a national campaign against Lorenzo
and Merrill Lynch.
   Eastern has sold the airline's most valuable assets, such as
wide-body planes and its computerized reservation system, to
subsidiaries for less than market value, Uehlein and other union
officials said.
   In complaining about the airline's safety concerns, Knudson, who
has been with Eastern for 21 years, said he was grounded for six
days in September 1987 after refusing to fly a plane with a broken
altitude alert.
   The warning device, which tells pilots when they have strayed
from a set altitude, is required on all civil passenger planes, he
said. Knudson said he was reinstated when Eastern failed to show
sufficient cause for his grounding.
   Knudson also said his co-pilot had been asked to fly more than
the 30 hours allowed during a seven-day period.
   Nancy Tauss, a flight attendant and vice president of the
Transport Workers Union, said Eastern management had searched
flight attendants and fired others for technicalities.
   ``Our people go to work each day not knowing if they're going to
be fired,'' she said.
   Ms. Musto said work rules, ignored for years, were being
enforced recently.
   Of Eastern's 32,000 employees, 7,000 belong to the Transport
Workers Union and 3,600 belong to the Air Line Pilots Association,
union officials said. Their contracts expire later this year.
   Eastern lost $182 million on total revenue of $4.4 billion in
1987 and has lost $500 million since airline deregulation in 1978,
Ms. Musto said.

   The stock market took its sharpest drop in
nearly two months Thursday, giving back some of the gains from its
early-1988 rally.
   The selloff hit both the blue chips and the smaller secondary

<HEAD>Gold Futures Rally As Oil Tops $16</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold and platinum futures prices made strong gains Thursday,
partly in response to a rise in the price of crude oil to $16 a
barrel for the first time this month, analysts said.
   On other markets, stock-index futures fell sharply; grain and
soybean prices retreated broadly; and livestock and meat futures
were mixed.
   The sharp increase in energy futures prices on a rumored
production cut by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
had inflationary implications that supported precious metals
futures, analysts said.
   ``There's a view in the market that inflation's going to be
picking up toward the end of the year and that inflation is going
to be more of a concern than recession at year end,'' said Fred
Demler, metals economist for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New
York.
   In addition, talk of physical tightness developing in the cash
platinum market after two quarters of price weakness helped spur
buying of platinum futures, and some of that buying interest
spilled over into the gold market, Demler said.
   Demler said the gold and platinum markets were oversold and due
for an upside correction to bring futures prices more in line with
reality.
   Silver futures declined slightly.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled $7 to $8.40
higher with the contract for delivery in April at $444.50 a troy
ounce; silver was 3.3 cents to 3.7 cents lower with March at $6.265
a troy ounce.
   Platinum settled $16.80 to $18.50 higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange with April at $498.10.
   The rumors of OPEC production cuts that fueled the jump in
energy futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange were later
denied, but oil prices fell only slightly from their highs of the
day.
   Market players still expect OPEC nations to take measures aimed
at boosting prices, said Bob Baker, an analyst for Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 44 cents to 51 cents
higher with April at $16 a barrel; heating oil was .72 cent to 1.07
cents higher with April at 43.93 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .66 cent to 1.14 cents higher at 45.14 cents a gallon.
   Inflationary fears also contributed to a sharp drop in
stock-index futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, analysts
said.
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange's contract for March delivery of
the Standard & Poor's 500 index settled 6.75 points lower at
262.90, nearly a full point below the spot index.
   Grain and soybean futures closed broadly lower on the Chicago
Board of Trade with little buying interest in the face of bearish
fundamentals.
   Traders expect a March 31 government report on spring plantings
will show a general increase in crop acreage, said Ted Mao, grain
specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Other market pressures include the large soybean crop now being
harvested in South America, an increase in world vegetable-oil
production and the lackluster prospects for new grain export sales
to the Soviet Union in the near term, Mao said.
   Wheat settled 4} cents to 9 cents lower with March at $2.90 a
bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2\ cents lower with March at $1.97} a
bushel; oats were 3 cents to 6 cents lower with March at $1.81\ a
bushel; soybeans were 2\ cents to 6 cents lower with March at
$6.03} a bushel.
   Live cattle futures finished slightly lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange on expectations of increased slaughters next
week, analysts said. Feeder cattle were mostly higher.
   Pork futures retreated on ideas that ham supplies were
sufficient to satisfy Eastertime demand, said Tom O'Hare, analyst
in New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   Live cattle were .08 cent lower to .02 cent higher with April at
72.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .48 cent
higher with March at 81.55 cents a pound; hogs were .28 cent lower
to .05 cent higher with April at 43.32 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .50 cent to .75 cent lower with March at 51.65 cents a
pound.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed; Gold Rises</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was mixed Thursday as trading in the
other major currencies continued to dominate foreign-exchange
markets.
   Gold prices advanced sharply amid a confluence of factors.
Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid price of $442.50
for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EST, up $6.35 an ounce from
$436.15 late Wednesday.
   The British pound, which has soared in recent trading sessions,
gave up some ground to profit-taking after Britain's Chancellor of
the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said sterling would be unable to sustain
a further advance.
   In London, the pound fell to $1.8435 from $1.8460 late
Wednesday. In later New York trading, sterling slipped to $1.8462
from $1.8475 late Wednesday.
   With the slippage in the pound, traders turned not to the
dollar, but to other currencies, said James McGroarty, a vice
president at Discount Corp.
   The French franc fell and the West German mark gained following
rumors that French President Francois Mitterrand might not run for
re-election in May, McGroarty said.
   ``The dollar has been very much sidetracked by all this,'' he
said.
   He said trading in the dollar remained listless as the market
awaited the release of several economic reports from Washington:
retail sales and producer price figures on Friday, and balance of
trade numbers next week.
   In Europe, currency dealers said the mark gained against most
other major currencies in late trading after the Bank of France
withdrew its support for the franc against the mark.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 128.20 Japanese yen from
128.08 yen at Wednesday's close. Later, in London, the dollar fell
back to 127.85 yen, and in New York, it rose marginally to 127.955
yen from 127.95 yen late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's prices, included: 1.66345 West German marks, down from
1.66895; 1.3785 Swiss francs, down from 1.37905; 5.6665 French
francs, up from 5.6530; 1,236.625 Italian lire, up from 1,232.50;
and 1.25685 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2537.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday,
included: 1.6640 West German marks, down from 1.6685; 1.3785 Swiss
francs, unchanged; 5.6725 French francs, up from 5.6485; 1.8720
Dutch guilders, down from 1.8750; 1,236.625 Italian lire, up from
1,231.50; and 1.2564 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2532.
   Gold prices surged amid a variety of factors, said Stephen
Platt, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   There was nervousness in bullion markets about the upcoming
economic reports and about rising energy prices, Platt said.
   The benchmark U.S. crude oil jumped 51 cents to $16 a barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange after reports that officials of
the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries were
studying a plan to cut production.
   Rising energy prices are believed to be a harbinger of higher
inflation, and gold is considered a safe haven during inflationary
periods.
   Gold also rose because it may have been oversold recently, Platt
said.
   Bullion soared $7 on the Commodity Exchange in New York, closing
at $443.20 a troy ounce.
   In London, gold jumped to a late bid price of $443 a troy ounce,
up from $436.50 bid late Wednesday.
   In Zurich, Switzerland, it rose to $442.50 bid from $437 bid
late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $438.42 bid, up from
$438.01 bid at Wednesday's close.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid price of $6.36 a
troy ounce, from $6.31 bid late Wednesday. But it fell on the
Commodity Exchange, slipping 3.3 cents to $6.265.

<HEAD>Money Supply Fell In Late February</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply fell in late February, the Federal Reserve Board reported
Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $2,947.5 billion in the week ended Feb. 29 from $2,953.1
billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted
$3,722.4 billion from $3,724.4 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $755.1 billion from a revised $762.1 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures
   The Fed said in early 1988 that it would like annual growth for
M2 and M3 to be between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is slightly
lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent. The Fed
has not set a specific target range for M1 since early 1987.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $1.3 billion,
compared with a decline of $1.07 billion a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window averaged $378 million a day
in the week ended Wednesday, up from $187 million a day in the
previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged $615
million in the latest two-week period, down from a revised $879
million in the previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $271.2 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, down from $272.4 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Rover Announces Sharply Improved Results After Shedding Leyland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state-owned Rover Group said it lost money in
1987, but far less than it lost in 1986.
   The latest shortfall totaled 26.8 million pounds, or $49.3
million _ a fraction of the record 892.1 million-pound net loss the
previous year, before it sold its Leyland bus and truck divisions.
   At the time the 1986 loss was the equivalent of $1.09 billion.
   The group achieved an operating profit of 27.9 million pounds,
or $51.3 million, in 1987, its best result for 19 years, the
company announcement said. Last year, the group posted an operating
loss of 355.6 million pounds.
   It's Land Rover division surged ahead last year, increasing
operating profits from 1.6 million pounds in 1986 to 22.5 million
pounds, or $41.4 million, in 1987.
   The group's largest company, Austin Rover, turned an operating
loss of 166.6 million pounds into a profit of 5.1 million pounds,
or $9.4 million, last year.
   The group, whose models include the popular Rover Sterling and
Range Rover, exported nearly 174,000 vehicles for just over 1
billion pounds, or $1.85 billion _ a 69 percent increase over 1986.
   Total sales at 513,000 vehicles were up 11 percent, the company
said.

<HEAD>Farmers Rejects Hostile Tender Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers Group Inc., a leading insurer, said
Thursday its board unanimously rejected an unsolicited $63 per
share, or $4.4 billion, tender offer from the U.S. susidiary of
British BAT Industries PLC.
   Farmers also said it was urging shareholders to reject the offer.
   The action by Farmers had been expected since the company has
consistently spurned BAT's overtures since the the British company
proposed a friendly $60-per-share merger in January.
   BAT's Louisville, Ky.-based unit, Batus Inc., launched the
sweetened hostile tender offer a week ago after Farmers' repeatedly
refused to meet and discuss a merger. The tender offer expires
March 30.
   Batus had no comment on the rejection by Farmers.
   The price being offered by Batus is still well below the $70 to
$80 per share that some analysts say Farmers should be able to
attract, although Batus officials have insisted their offer
represents a fair price.
   Farmers' stock was trading in the mid-$40 range before Batus
made it initial proposal. It closed Thursay at $60 per share, down
75 cents.
   Meantime, the companies in the past week have filed a flurry of
legal actions in the takeover fight.
   Farmers filed suit in federal court in Reno, Nev., where it is
incorporated, challenging Batus' efforts to place a proposal before
shareholders at the Farmer's May 20 annual meeting urging that
merger negotiations be held.
   Batus has filed suit in Nevada, Nebraska and South Carolina
seeking to block enforcement of laws restricting takeovers in those
states.

   Wang Laboratories Inc.'s stock fell more than 20
percent Thursday as the company said customers were delaying
orders, cutting into the company's projected revenue and
profitability.
   Wang's Class B stock fell $3.50 a share to $12.87{ in
consolidated trading on the American Stock Exchange.
   In response to questions from securities analysts, Wang said it
expected its revenue in the third fiscal quarter ending March 31 to
be up 4 percent to 6 percent from the year-earlier level, instead
of 10 percent to 12 percent as previously projected.
   Wang also said it expects third-quarter profits to be about 3
percent of revenue, instead of 3 percent to 5 percent as previously
projected.
   The Lowell, Mass.-based maker of minicomputers and
office-automation equipment said it continues to expect to achieve
its goals for revenue and profits for the full fiscal year,
indicating that orders expected for the third quarter will be
recorded in the fourth quarter instead.
   Wang also said its new family of Wang Integrated Image Systems,
which allow users to manipulate data, text and images on the same
terminals, were proceeding as planned and ``generating a
higher-than-expected level of customer interest.''
   Fred Wang, the president and chief executive, said some of the
slowing of orders may have come from customers' doubts about the
economic outlook, which has brightened recently.

<HEAD>Whitten Says Plan to Sell Naval Oil Reserves `Doesn't Look Good'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A powerful House committee chairman told the
secretary of energy Thursday the Reagan administration's plan to
sell the naval petroleum reserves in California and Wyoming
``doesn't look good.''
   ``Privatization means let somebody have it so they can make some
money,'' Rep. Jamie Whitten, D-Miss., told Secretary John
Herrington, after recounting how he stopped the sale of the Elk
Hills oil reserve in California as a young member of Congress in
1943.
   ``I have a long memory,'' said Whitten, who is chairman of the
Appropriations Committee and as such, a member of the subcommittee
on energy and water development before which Herrington appeared.
According to his account, the potential 1943 buyer would have taken
oil from the field for immediate use and repaid the Navy at such a
slow rate that it would have taken 450 years to square accounts.
   Though still called Naval Petroleum Reserves, the two oil fields
have been controlled by the Energy Department in commercial
production since the mid-1970s.
   Whitten's objections were seconded by the ranking Republican on
the subcommittee, Rep. John T. Myers of Indiana, who said, ``I've
never understood why you wanted to sell that and pump in new oil''
into storage in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in Lousiana and
Texas.
   The Elk Hills field, 22 percent owned by Chevron Corp. and the
rest by the government, is ``not a reserve, it's a cash cow'' being
milked for money by a revenue-hungry Congress, Herrington said.
   ``We had no business selling oil from there (Elk Hills) at $8
and $10 a barrel'' in the price collapse of 1986, said Herrington.
But the department did not have authority to suspend production as
a private owner would have done, he said.
   The administration's budget request assumes that sale of the two
oil fields will bring in $3.5 billion over the next two fiscal
years. The department's consultants said proceeds could be $4.3
billion, and Herrington told the subcommittee the amount ``could be
as high as $7 billion'' if Congress allows the sale.
   ``You're going to have to get 3 million barrels a day or 4
million barrels a day into the economy on an ASAP basis and you
can't do that at Elk Hills,'' said Herrington.
   Thus, he said, it makes sense to sell the naval reserves and use
the money to buy oil for the Louisiana-Texas stockpile because Elk
Hills can produce only about 115,000 barrels a day and the Teapot
Dome Reserve in Wyoming can produce only about 3,000 barrels a day.
   The salt domes of the Gulf Coast now hold 540 million barrels of
crude oil, roughly the equivalent of 90 days of imports, and can
pump oil to refineries at the rate of 3.5 million barrels a day.
   If the sale goes through, the department proposes to use the
money to increase additions to the strategic reserve from 50,000
barrels a day to 100,000 barrels a day.
