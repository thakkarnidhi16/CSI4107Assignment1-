   China's senior leader Deng Xiaoping told visiting
U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz on Friday that their two
nations should lift relations to ``a higher plane'' in the interest
of the whole world.
   The 83-year-old Deng said at the opening of the talks with
Shultz that Chinese-American relations have improved steadily
during the Reagan presidency.
   ``Of course, there are still some problems between us,'' he
said. ``I think it is quite natural for two countries to have a
divergent point of view or even have differences.''
   Shultz held talks with Chinese officials Thursday on the
Cambodian conflict and Chinese weapons sales to the Middle East.
   On Friday, however, Deng stressed common interests. ``Though
China is one of the poorest countries in the world and the United
States is one of the richest countries,'' he said, ``after all,
both of us are big countries.''
   ``We should bring our relationship to a higher plane in the
interest of peace and the interest of the people of the world.''
   Shultz said, ``I have a very confident feeling that the
relationship that's developed between the United States and China
has broad bipartisan support, and so we can expect real continuity
in this relationship.''
   Shultz arrived Thursday for a two-day visit, his fourth to China
since he assumed his post in 1982.
   The secretary also met Friday with Premier Li Peng before
afternoon talks with Communist Party Secretary-General Zhao Ziyang.
   Deng has retired from all his posts except chairmanship of the
Central Military Commission.
   However, he still wields considerable influence in the
government and party. He was apparently in good spirits Friday,
smiling and going out of his way to shake hands with American
security guards.
   He told Shultz, who was on the sixth stop of a nine-nation Asian
tour, ``I think you are the busiest man on Earth.''
   On Thursday, Shultz met for more than three hours with Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen for what the American side characterized as
``a very good exchange.'' They discussed Cambodia and the
proliferation of weapons sales in developing countries.
   Qian emphasized that China does not support the return of the
Khmer Rouge to a dominant role in Cambodia following the withdrawal
of Vietnamese troops.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 to end a three-year reign
of terror by the Khmer Rouge. It says it will pull out its
estimated 120,000 troops in the next few years. The United States
and Southeast Asian countries have expressed concern that the Khmer
Rouge, backed by Chinese arms, will step into the power vacuum.
   However, Qian said Thursday that some senior Khmer Rouge leaders
may retire. The remark suggested that Pol Pot and others associated
with bloody policies of the mid-70s will not play a role in any
future Cambodian government.
   Qian also said China foresees a potential role for an
international peacekeeping force in Cambodia. Both China and the
United States have called for an immediate end to Vietnam's
military occupation.
   Shultz, in his talks with Qian and at a later banquet speech,
spoke in general terms of the dangers of introducing sophisticated
weapons into the Middle East and other unstable regions.
   But U.S. sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he
did not specifically criticize China for selling intermediate-range
ballistic missiles to Mideast countries while Moscow and Washington
are eliminating such weapons from their arsenals. Shultz had made
such criticism earlier on his tour.
   Shultz said in his banquet speech, ``It is ironic that just as
the major powers are making progress in getting their arms
competition under some control, the developing world is
increasingly burdened by this flow of advanced weaponry.''
   The United States is concerned that China, a major arms supplier
to Iran, Iraq and other Middle East nations, has sold the CSS-2
missile to Saudi Arabia and is developing and already marketing the
M-9 missile in the region.
   According to U.S. figures, China sold about $2 billion worth of
arms last year.
   Qian was quoted as telling Shultz that China sells only
defensive weapons that contribute to peace and regional stability.
   Shultz also applauded recent South Korean moves to ease tensions
on the Korean Peninsula and called on North Korea to respond and
help ensure a safe and successful Olympic Games in Seoul, the
South's capital, this fall. China is a close ally of communist
North Korea.
   Shultz was scheduled to leave Saturday morning for Seoul. His
tour was also to take him to Japan and the Marshall Islands.

   Disc jockey Steve Stiles had good news and
bad news.
   The good news was that Stiles' morning show co-host, Melody
Owen, said yes to his on-air proposal of marriage Wednesday morning.
   The bad news came hours later when both he and Owen received
word that their ``Steve and Mel and the Morning Music Crew'' no
longer will be broadcast on WZPL-FM.
   ``They said `Congratulations, you made national news.' Then they
said, `You're fired,''' Owen said. ``We're shocked. Everybody
thinks this is a bigger story than the engagement.''
   WZPL-FM General Manager Roger Ingram said Stiles and Owen were
leaving by mutual agreement.
   ``Steve and Mel issued us an ultimatum that we could not agree
to,'' Ingram said in a prepared statement Wednesday evening. ``It
was a mutual parting of the ways unrelated to their engagement.''
   Stiles and Owen, however, both said the decision was not mutual.
   ``I have no idea whether it was related to the engagement,''
Stiles said. ``But there was no parting of the ways through mutual
agreement.''
   Stiles, who has been dating Owen since last August, said he made
the decision for the on-the-air proposal without consulting with
WZPL-FM management.
   ``In the 6 o'clock hour he just opened the mike and said he
would have a major announcement. And he wouldn't tell me what,''
said Owen, 29.
   ``I responded, `What are you trying to say. Are we getting
fired?' Which is a real natural response, I thought,'' she said.
   At 7:25 a.m., Stiles popped the question.
   ``I couldn't speak. I made a sound. It sounded like ahhh,'' Owen
said. ``I just looked at him and said `Are you serious. We're on
the air. Are you serious?'''
   When he pulled out a ring, Owen started to cry. Stiles then
turned to a record, ``She's like the wind,'' by Patrick Swayze,
according to Owen.
   ``It was something I actually didn't want to do,'' he said.
``Obviously people were going to ask, `What the hell are you
doing?' But it was getting tough not to talk about our relationship
on the air.''

<HEAD>US Warships Not Monitoring Gulf Commercial Channels</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. warships do not routinely monitor radio
communications between airliners and air traffic controllers in the
Persian Gulf and have not regularly done so since the USS Vincennes
shot down Iran Air Flight 655, say Pentagon officials.
   Iran says the A300 Airbus had communicated with air traffic
control at Bandar Abbas, Iran, in English, the international
language for airlines, and that if the Vincennes had been
listening, it might not have mistaken the airliner for an Iranian
F-14 fighter.
   Iran has asked the United Nations Security Council and
International Civil Aviation Organization to review the July 3
incident. The Pentagon is conducting its own investigation, which
spokesman Dan Howard has said will determine what radio and radar
information was available to the skipper of the Vincennes, Capt.
Will C. Rogers III.
   Other Pentagon officials said Wednesday that as a standard
practice, U.S. warships in the gulf monitor three communications
channels, in addition to those used for transmissions among
themselves.
   The channels routinely monitored are a ``bridge-to-bridge''
frequency used by civilian and military ship captains; a civilian
distress channel used by ships and planes and a military distress
channel used by military ships and planes, said one official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``There are many, many radio frequencies used. It would take a
heck of a lot of people to monitor all of them,'' Howard told
reporters last week.
   And on Wednesday, Navy sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity said U.S. warships do not monitor the various wavelengths
used by air traffic controllers.
   Air traffic control communications may have been monitored by
the National Security Agency, the government organization that
collects electronic intelligence. However, NSA does not publicly
discuss its activities and it was not clear whether any
intelligence it gathered would be disclosed along with the results
of the Pentagon investigation, officials said.
   Ships in the U.S. gulf fleet have not been ordered to change
their routine monitoring, nor has additional radio equipment been
supplied to them since the incident, the sources said.
   Public statements by senior Pentagon officials indicate that the
single VHF monitoring station on the Vincennes was used during the
incident to send warnings to the approaching aircraft.
   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William J. Crowe
Jr., in a news conference hours after the shootdown, said ``we
warned him (the Iran Air pilot) on the civilian air distress net
three times in these few minutes, and four times on the military
air distress net.''
   Crowe also said he was not aware of any radio communications
from the airliner that were intercepted by naval forces in the
gulf. But he said ``we have contacted airliners before. And we have
had them respond.''
   The Pentagon investigation team, headed by Rear Adm. William M.
Fogarty, has received a computer analysis of the tapes of the
Vincennes electronic system that theoretically will tell them
whether the cruiser was monitoring Iranian air traffic control
communications, U.S. sources in the gulf say.
   ``There are 21 possible tape channels on the ship. They can be
switched to various systems. I do not know which systems there were
recording and which ones were turned on at this particular time,''
Howard said. ``But it does have the capability to record both
external communications and internal, from station to station.''

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration is defending its
plan to spray U.S. marijuana crops with the highly toxic herbicide
paraquat, which can cause serious harm when inhaled or absorbed by
humans or animals.
   At a news conference Wednesday, Attorney General Edwin Meese III
said ``the real environmental damage'' is being done by growers of
marijuana.
   He contended that growers are cutting down trees, damming
streams ``and pouring pesticides and fertilizer'' into the water to
irrigate their crops.
   Meese said many large-scale marijuana growers have moved their
operations into national forests and other remote areas to avoid
detection. Because of the dispersal, Meese said ``there are less
and less places that are good targets'' for aerial herbicide
spraying but that ``whenever we find them, we're ready to do it.''
   Drug Enforcement Administration director John Lawn said
paraquat, which was banned from use on national forests in 1983
because of environmental concerns, would be one of three herbicides
used in the current program.
   A DEA spokesman, Cornelius Dougherty, subsequently said that
paraquat would be used in spraying for marijuana eradication on
private land, not on public property, in light of the court ruling.
The other two herbicides cited by Lawn _ 2, 4 d and glyphosate _
are not involved in the 1983 federal court decision and could be
used in spraying on public lands.
   An environmental group criticized the use of herbicides in
general on public lands.
   ``The other two chemicals don't have the same restrictions, but
while that may be complying with the letter of the law, it is
violating the principles that protect national lands to ensure the
protection of wildlife habitats and recreation areas,'' said Jay
Feldman, coordinator of the National Coalition Against the Misuse
of Pesticides.
   Lawn said the government must prepare an environmental impact
statement when eradication is contemplated and that ``at that
point, the determination is made by environmentalists, by law
enforcement, which chemical will be most effective.''

   Some of President Reagan's most conservative
followers are saying the nomination of Richard Thornburgh as
attorney general points up a disturbing presidential weakness.
   The right wing has been frustrated whenever Reagan filled a key
vacancy with someone less dedicated to the conservative cause than
the person leaving the administration.
   The president chose this course again, conservative critics say,
when he tapped former the former Pennsylvania governor to succeed
Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   Conservatives, including some within the White House itself,
sent letters to White House chief of staff Kenneth Duberstein
complaining that Reagan effectively abandoned the right-to-life
movement with his Thornburgh choice.
   Thornburgh has a mixed record on that issue. In December 1981,
he vetoed an Abortion Control Act, saying he objected to sections
that said life started at conception, that mandated a 24-hour
waiting period and that would have established criminal penalties
for doctors who broke the law.
   On June 11, 1982, however, Thornburgh signed a watered-down
version of the abortion bill, which required doctors to notify
women about the risks of abortion and the availability of medical
assistance for prenatal care and childbirth. Portions of the law
were struck down later by the U.S. Supreme Court.
   An administration official, discussing Reagan's nominations on
grounds that he not be named publicly, said, ``I think that among
social conservatives around the country, there certainly is a
perception that when key openings occur, he has tended to revert
back to old-line Republicans.''
   Reagan's chief spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, scoffed at
suggestions that Reagan often picks people more moderate than their
predecessors.
   ``Gov. Thornburgh is a conservative Republican who is known for
his legal acumen and his strong position on law enforcement,'' he
said. ``He (Reagan) replaces good people with good people,'' not
conservatives with liberals.
   But Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., wasn't buying that.
   He said Reagan increasingly has moved to the political center to
choose people for important jobs, and said, ``We see it as
representing a trend that has accelerated'' since Howard H. Baker
Jr. became Reagan's chief of staff.
   Baker, of course, is no longer at the White House, having
resigned earlier this month to return to private life.
   Humphrey complained that Thornburgh and some other recent Reagan
appointees ``don't have much of a commitment at all to the social
side of the Reagan agenda. ... I think expediency is the order of
the day.''
   The New Hampshire conservative also maintained that Reagan's key
appointments in the waning months of the administration will be
unduly influenced by Vice President George Bush.
   ``I think Thornburgh is a Bush-type, moderate Rockefeller
Republican, who doesn't give a damn about the social issues that
are driving the Reagan coalition,'' the senator said.
   Thornburgh has said he will deal with such substantive questions
in talks with senators, but not in the press.
   Humphrey said he phoned Bush's campaign manager, Lee Atwater, to
complain about the Thornburgh move, saying, ``if that is any
indication of what we're going to get from a Bush administration,
then I can't get too enthusiastic.''
   The administration official said the Thornburgh nomination is
not an isolated incident and noted that after Reagan's unsuccessful
bid to put conservative Robert H. Bork on the Supreme Court, the
president ultimately settled on the more moderate Judge Anthony M.
Kennedy.
   ``I think social conservatives now feel that if we (the
Republican Party) lose the issues of the heart, such as abortion,
school prayer and family values, the chance of really forming a
lasting political realignment will be gone,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Ridding the nation's nuclear weapons plants of
contamination will be a ``monstrous'' problem but must be done, a
senator said after releasing a study that put the price tag at more
than $130 billion.
   ``We're endangering people on the bases, we're endangering
workers, we're endangering people in surrounding communities,''
Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, said Wednesday as he released a
congressional study estimating the cleanup costs.
   The $130 billion estimate could jump by an additional $25
billion if production at the plants is expanded, capacity is
relocated, or both, the General Accounting Office study said.
   ``We just have to do this cleanup,'' Glenn said. ``It's going to
be monstrous, it's going to be expensive, but we have to do it.''
   The report, which was requested by Glenn and released at a
hearing held by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, comes on
the heels of cost estimates compiled by the U.S. Department of
Energy and made public July 1.
   The department said cleaning up contamination and correcting
other problems at 17 major defense plants could cost between $40
billion and $70 billion, and jump to as high as $110 billion in
order to maintain standards through the year 2045.
   However, the GAO computed additional costs in its estimates,
including plant improvements and the disposal of radioactive waste.
   The installations, which are scattered across the country,
produce nuclear materials and weapons for U.S. defense needs.
   The GAO survey focused on the department's major defense plants,
including the Savannah River plant in South Carolina, the Feed
Materials Production Center and the Mound plant, both in Ohio, the
Rocky Flats plant in Colorado, the Y-12 plant in Tennessee, Hanford
Reservation in Washington state, the Kansas City electronics plant,
the Pinellas plant in Florida, the Pantex plant in Texas, Sandia
and Los Alamos national laboratories, both in New Mexico, the
Nevada test site, Idaho National Engineering Lab and Lawrence
Livermore National Lab in California.
   The GAO did not provide a cost breakdown for each installation.

<HEAD>Drought Driving Down Meat Prices</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a couple of bumper corn crops and
relatively low feed prices, livestock producers thought they saw
some daylight ahead, but the dark may be closing in again, an
Agriculture Department report shows.
   The drought and sizzling heat of May and June have already
squeezed livestock producers and could hurt them further if
conditions persist much longer, the department's Economic Research
Service said Wednesday.
   ``Rising costs brought on by drought are affecting livestock and
poultry producers' returns,'' the agency said in a new outlook
summary. ``Also, poor pasture and range conditions are reducing
forage supplies for cattle and lamb producers.''
   The report added, ``If the drought continues, hog and cattle
slaughter may be boosted, adding to already record red meat and
poultry supplies.''
   Market prices of cattle dropped in June, following record high
levels during the spring, and likely resulted, in part, from large
meat supplies, the report said.
   ``Feeder cattle prices weakened in response to lower fed cattle
prices and rising feed costs,'' it said. ``While lower feeder
cattle prices reduce returns to cow-calf producers, the more
immediate problem is poor pasture and water conditions.''
   Although hay cut from land idled under federal programs has
helped, there will be more pressure to reduce the cattle inventory
if pastures continue to deteriorate, the report said.
   Total production of red meat and poultry in 1988 is expected to
rise 3 percent to a record 59.9 billion pounds, but all the gain
will be from pork, lamb and mutton, and poultry.
   Beef production this year was forecast at 22.9 billion pounds,
down 2 percent from last year.
   Pork output, at 15.6 billion pounds, would be up 9 percent from
1987. Lamb and mutton was shown at 326 million pounds, up 6
percent. Veal, however, is expected to decline 5 percent from last
year to 397 million pounds.
   Federally inspected poultry production this year was forecast at
20.6 billion pounds, led by a 4 percent increase in broiler output
to nearly 16.2 billion pounds. Turkey production was forecast at
3.89 billion pounds, up 4 percent from 1987.
   Economists said market prices of Choice-grade steers at Omaha,
Neb., may average $65 to $69 per 100 pounds of liveweight in the
third quarter, down from $72.81 in the second. In the fourth
quarter, steer prices may average $68 to $71 per hundredweight.
   Hog prices at the major markets were forecast at $43 to $47 per
100 pounds in the third quarter and $37 to $43 in the fourth,
compared with $45.90 in the second quarter.
   ``Rising poultry prices have more than offset higher feed
costs,'' the report said. ``Wholesale broiler prices are expected
to average 51 to 54 cents per pound (over all of this year), up
from 47 cents in 1987.''

   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
150,000 metric tons of U.S. corn for delivery this year under a
long-term supply agreement between the two countries, says the
Agriculture Department.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 150,000 tons of
corn would be about 5.9 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.70 per bushel at the
farm level, meaning that the sale reported Wednesday could have a
farm value of around $16 million.
   The corn is part of the grain the Soviet Union is committed to
buy during the fifth and final year of the agreement, which calls
for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of U.S. grain.
The pact expires Sept. 30.
   According to the agreement, the annual purchases are supposed to
include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The
Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as
wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two
tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.
   With the latest purchases, the Soviets now have bought 5.04
million tons of corn, plus more than 9 million tons of wheat;
830,700 tons of soybeans, and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal.

   Farmers in counties not hit by drought may
harvest hay under various Agriculture Department acreage and
conservation programs if they donate it to those in
drought-stricken areas.
   Previously, hay could be taken only from idled program land in
counties approved for emergency haying or grazing due to drought.
There are nearly 2,000 of those designated counties in 37 states.
   A producer who wishes to donate hay should contact the local
office of the department's Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service for harvesting permission, Agriculture
Secretary Richard E. Lyng said Wednesday.
   The farmer than must donate the hay through a designated state
agency engaged in drought relief efforts.

<HEAD>Analysts Doubt Further Credit Tightening By Fed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is
talking tough about using higher interest rates to fight inflation,
but many economists doubt the tough talk will be followed with much
action.
   These analysts believe the central bank, with an eye on the
November presidential election, has done all the credit tightening
it intends for a while.
   For this reason, they are looking for interest rates to stay
about where they are currently in coming months. That would be good
news for the housing industry as mortgage rates level off, and it
would mean consumers and businesses may be spared another jump in
the prime lending rate.
   Greenspan, delivering his mid-year report on Fed monetary policy
to Congress on Wednesday, issued some stern warnings about rising
inflationary threats in the economy, singling out tight labor
markets, rising import prices and the drought's effect on grain
prices as particularly worrisome.
   He said the central bank had already made a series of credit
tightening moves ``from late March through late June'' in an effort
to keep inflation in check.
   ``The costs to our economy and society of allowing a more
intense inflationary process to become entrenched are serious,''
Greenspan said.
   But Greenspan also suggested that the credit-tightening which
has occurred may be enough to dampen inflationary pressures because
of an expected moderation in growth in the second half of 1988.
   Greenspan said that factory utilization rates ``could well top
out soon'' and he also predicted that the unemployment rate, which
has fallen dramatically this year, would level off. Both of those
developments would be seen as easing inflationary pressures.
   In response to a question, Greenspan said he did not think that
further increases in interest rates were inevitable, especially if
current inflationary pressures begin to ease.
   There had been widespead expectations that the Fed would soon
move to nudge interest rates higher, especially since the
unemployment rate fell to a 14-year low of 5.3 percent in June.
   But many analysts said Greenspan's comments seemed to indicate
that the central bank is satisfied that it has done enough for now.
   Beginning in late March, the Fed initiated a series of
credit-tightening moves by reducing the amount of money banks have
to make loans. Those efforts have pushed a key interest rate, the
rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, up by a full
percentage point.
   That in turn triggered an increase in the prime lending rate to
9 percent in May and sent mortgage rates, which had dropped below
10 percent, up to a current level of 10.38 percent.
   David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., a New
York securities dealer, said he believed rates would hold steady at
these levels in coming months.
   ``Greenspan feels he has taken the appropriate tightening steps
and that will be enough to cool off demand growth in the second
half of the year,'' Jones said.
   ``Greenspan believes the economy will not be that strong in the
second half and that you shouldn't tighten credit conditions with
an economy slowing considerably,'' said Michael Evans, head of a
Washington consulting firm.
   David Wyss, chief financial economist at Data Resources Inc.,
predicted that the Federal Reserve would ``keep its head low during
the election campaign'' and will avoid its strongest tightening
move, a boost in the discount rate it charges on money it loans to
member banks.
   Many analysts believe that Greenspan, and the other members of
the Federal Reserve's board of governors, all appointed by
President Reagan, would try to keep the economy on an even keel in
an effort to promote George Bush's presidential chances.
   But some senators at the hearing expressed concern that
Greenspan and the Fed had already overdone the efforts at
tightening credit conditions and had raised the risk of a recession
next year.
   ``I would come down on the side of avoiding a recession almost
at all costs,'' Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., lectured Greenspan. ``I
do hope the Fed would not be hypersensitive to signs, real or
imagined, of inflation.''

<HEAD>House Panel Moves to Block Battlefield Shopping Mall</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Momentum is building in Congress to protect a
hallowed Civil War battleground from a massive shopping center
complex that a developer wants to build next door.
   The House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee approved a
measure Wednesday authorizing the federal government to seize a
542-acre tract next to the Manassas National Battlefield Park.
   The bill, a combination of legislation introduced by Rep. Frank
Wolf, R-Va., and another bill sponsored by Reps. Michael Andrews,
D-Texas, and Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., now moves to the House floor
after passing the committee by a 27-11 vote. Supporters hope the
matter will come up for a vote when the House reconvenes after the
Democratic National Convention.
   Critics of the measure, including Rep. Ron Marlenee, R-Mont.,
complained that the bill was too costly, but it was approved after
the panel defeated an amendment offered by Marlenee that would have
added 11,000 acres to the Custer Battlefield National Monument,
near Billings, Mont.
   The House committee vote came one day after a $10.6 billion
transportation bill passed by the Senate included a provision to
block any federal money from being used for highway construction
associated with the proposed William Center development.
   A similar measure had already been included in transportation
legislation approved by the House, and supporters of the provision
predict it will survive final legislative changes made by House and
Senate members.
   Congress entered the domain of local zoning officials after
historians and preservationists complained that the massive
development would destroy the rural sanctity of the 4,600-acre park
where two important Civil War battles took place.
   Developer John T. Hazel seeks to build a complex including 1.2
million square feet of retail space, 1.7 million square feet of
office space, and 560 homes. He bought the property in 1985 and
first proposed a small-scale office park for the site, then
expanded his plans to the current concept once Prince William
County, Va., officials relaxed zoning restrictions on the property.
   The park is the site of the First and Second Battles of
Manassas, which were both Confederate victories.

<HEAD>List Of Nation's Worst Includes 16 Reactors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two nuclear plants in New York and Nebraska
with good performance records are being added to the list of the
nation's worst because of concerns that their operators can't
handle things that aren't routine.
   By the same token, good performance in the face of the
unexpected has led the staff of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
to take a Colorado plant off the list.
   At the Nine Mile Point No. 1 plant in Scriba, N.Y., ``The
principal areas of concern (are) ... the ability of the
organization to identify problems, correct them and implement
successful solutions,'' said William Kane, regional director of
reactor programs, in a briefing for the commission on Wednesday.
   At the Fort Calhoun plant in Nebraska, the staff concerns have
to do ``not with the operating performance of the plant, which sets
records and operates exceedingly well,'' but with ``the depth of
their ability to withstand complex challenge when it occurs,'' said
Robert Martin, regional administrator based in Arlington, Texas.
   The listing, now 16 reactors at 10 sites, means the plants get
special surveillance and the owners generally have to show they can
operate safely.
   Special concern is no longer warranted for the Fort St. Vrain
plant Public Service Co. of Colorado near Denver, which has
suffered frequent breakdowns since it was built in 1979, the staff
said.
   ``Over the last six months, their performance has demonstrated
to us ... a good approach to the handling of issues,'' said Martin.
   The New York plant, on Lake Ontario, is 19 years old and, before
being forced out of service last December by feedwater problems,
had recently run for 420 days without a shutdown.
   This long run could have made the owner, Niagara Mohawk Power
Corp., complacent, the staff said.
   Company spokesman William Romano said Niagara is not disputing
the staff's conclusions and is working closely with it to solve
problems of leadership and morale and get the plant restarted.
   Martin said the Nebraska plant ``sets records and operates
exceedingly well'' but seems to lack ``engineering strength,
systems to critically review and look at the work they are doing.''
   Omaha Public Power District President Fred Petersen said in a
statement the district had acknowledged problems but believes Fort
Calhoun is ``one of the best nuclear plants in the United States.
We are committed to improving that record, however, and the
expertise of the NRC staff will have a positive effect in our
efforts in this regard.''
   A good response to challenge is one reason the Colorado plant no
longer needs special supervision, said Martin. Inspections have
shown ``a good operational work ethic,'' Martin said.
   ``We think it's wonderful,'' said company spokeswoman Kim
DeVigil. ``We have finally begun to work out some of the kinks and
get over some of the hurdles we had in our technology. Being one of
a kind, we didn't have somebody we could go to and say, `Hey, what
did you guys do?'''
   The Fort St. Vrain plant is the only one in the United States
using graphite to slow the neutrons that cause nuclear fission, and
helium to carry away the heat it produces.
   Its nine years of on-again, off-again operation have been marked
by serious technical problems, frequently with the non-nuclear
equipment. Last week it started what is expected to be a 14-week
shutdown to replace helium circulators.
   The other reactors the commission staff considers the worst in
the country are five owned by the Tennessee Valley Authority,
Sequoyah 2 and 3 and Browns Ferry 1, 2 and 3; two by Commonwealth
Edison Co. in Illinois, Dresden 2 and 3; two by Florida Power &
Light Co., Turkey Point 3 and 4; two by Philadelphia Electric Co.,
Peach Bottom 2 and 3; the Pilgrim plant of Boston Edison Co.; the
Rancho Seco plant of the Sacramento, Calif., Municipal Utility
District; and the Fermi plant of Detroit Edison Co.

   Star Wars anti-missile defenses in orbit could
be used as a cover for nuclear weapons capable of hitting targets
on earth on five minutes notice, a Soviet general says in a rare
interview.
   Maj. Gen. Boris Surikov said Star Wars devices, which the
Soviets call ``space strike weapons,'' could ``in the foreseeable
future be used to destroy strategically important targets on earth
and in space.''
   ``The current technology also gives the opportunity to start
cover deployment of space-to-earth strike weapons even now,'' he
said in the interview published Wednesday by the British magazine
Jane's Defence Weekly.
   ``Independently of the actual armaments of the U.S.
(anti-ballistic missiles) stations, the Soviet Union would assume
that they are armed with weapons able to destroy vital ground
targets within five minutes of a decision to mount a nuclear attack
from space,'' he said.
   Surikov also outlined steps the Soviets could take to outflank
Star Wars, formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   Although Soviet civilians and U.S. critics of Star Wars have
made points similar to Surikov's, the interview provided unusual
detail from a Soviet military source that Jane's described as ``his
government's expert on new types and systems of space-based
weapons.''
   Surikov hinted in the article that the Soviet Union might
destroy such stations soon after they were deployed.
   U.S. officials have denied that Star Wars would use nuclear
weapons or that other SDI devices, such as high-energy lasers,
would be used against targets on earth.
   Congress has barred the Reagan administration from spending any
money that might violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty,
which places strict limits on missile defenses.
   Surikov acknowledged that the Soviet Union ``is engaged in
research and development to improve the limited ABM system'' around
Moscow. He said the system was ``fully in compliance with Article
VII of the ABM Treaty,'' limiting each side to one ABM site
equipped with not more than 100 interceptors.
   He also confirmed that the Soviet Union is conducting research
on new weapons systems ``based on other physical principles,'' such
as lasers, at a test site allowed under the ABM pact.
   The article appeared as the Reagan administration tries to
decide whether to declare the Soviet Union in ``material breach''
of the ABM Treaty because it built a radar facility at Krasnoyarsk,
deep inside Siberia, instead of near the border as required by the
pact.
   The Soviets say the Krasnoyarsk radar is designed to track
vehicles in space, but suspended work on it a year ago before it
became operational.
   Surikov did not directly respond to U.S. allegations about the
facility, but said ``all Soviet radars have lower potentials'' than
the ceiling set in the ABM treaty, ``and cannot detect or track
ballistic missiles automatically or with the necessary accuracy.''
   The Soviet general also outlined steps that Moscow could take to
foil any strategic defense system built by the United States. The
countermeasures, all of which have been discussed publicly by
Western experts, include:
   _Early destruction or neutralization of orbiting stations by
``anti-ABM spacecraft armed with nuclear or conventional charges,''
``space mines'' or ``clouds of heavy or lightweight obstacles (like
metal balls, sawdust, sand. etc.)''
   _``A build-up of offensive arms'' to present SDI with an
overwhelming number of intercontinental ballistics missiles (ICBMs)
to target;
   _``Cheap ICBM decoys ... which would greatly overburden the
first space layer of the ABM defense'' and other ``imitation
devices ... to effectively camouflage the real nuclear warheads.''
   _``High acceleration missiles'' designed to release their
warheads before the launch vehicle could be destroyed by the first
layer of a space-based defense.
   _``Massive deployment of variously based cruise missiles'' or
``submarine launched ballistic missiles'' for which ``there are no
interceptors at present.''

<HEAD>Bentsen Puts On Senate Hat Again Today After A Day With Dukakis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lloyd Bentsen was returning to his customary
Senate duties today after a first full day of campaign-style
appearances with his new political partner, Democratic presidential
nominee-to-be Michael Dukakis.
   At a news conference on Wednesday, Bentsen looked relaxed and
comfortable in his day-old role as Dukakis' running mate. With the
Massachusetts governor at his side, Bentsen minimized his
differences with Dukakis on such issues as abortion funding, Contra
aid, and the Reagan tax cuts.
   On ``the vast majority'' of issues, from jobs to health care to
education, ``we share a common cause,'' the Texas senator said.
   On Wednesday, Bentsen skipped a Finance Committee meeting to
make the political rounds with Dukakis. Today, though, he was
presiding as committee chairman at a hearing on the U.S.-Canada
free trade agreement.
   Bentsen won a warm bipartisan tribute from his Senate colleagues
Wednesday night. As he entered the chamber for a roll call,
Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas spotted him and said: ``I'd
like to extend my congratulations to Sen. Bentsen, from this side
of the aisle.''
   The senators present, Republicans and Democrats alike, rose to
their feet and burst into applause. Bentsen grinned and waved.
   Bentsen was asked Wednesday at his Capitol Hill news conference
with Dukakis about his plans to run for re-election to his Senate
seat as well as the vice presidency in November.
   ``I can't get off the ticket in Texas. That's the way the law is
written,'' he said. ``If I was to step off the ticket, that would
forfeit it to the Republican challenger, and I can't do that.''
   At the news conference, Bentsen laughed off a question about
whether his age _ 67 _ was ``prohibitive,'' and challenged his
questioner, Sam Donaldson of ABC, to a tennis match.
   Bentsen said his 94-year-old father ``goes to work every morning
by 6 o'clock, works six days a week, drives his own car and has a
fuzzbuster on the dash.'' He hastened to add that in Texas, such
radar-detection devices are legal.
   Earlier, Bentsen got a chilly reception at the NAACP convention,
where some delegates booed when Dukakis introduced the running mate
he choose over Jesse Jackson. NAACP executive director Benjamin L.
Hooks intervened to cajole the delegates into offering Bentsen a
warmer hand.
   Bentsen told the NAACP that, ``For all who are commited to
justice and equality, indifference is simply not an option in 1988.
   ``If you care about the make-up of the Civil Rights Commission
... or the composition of the Supreme Court or ther leadership of
the Justice Department, or about equality and progress in jobs and
schools, I think you have to vote for Michael Dukakis,'' said
Bentsen.
   ``It's important not just for the NAACP, not just for black
Americans, but for all who care about freedom and opportunity, for
all who believe that government can be a force for fairness, for
all who believe in the politics of inclusion,'' he said.
   ``Mike Dukakis and I are committed to making a difference for
America ... and we need your help,'' said Bentsen.
   Bentsen said he talked by telephone with Jackson earlier
Wednesday.
   ``Jesse Jackson is a friend of mine, he's a very able gentleman,
and I wanted to establish communications with him. And that I did,
and I think we had a very good conversation,'' he said.
   Bentsen once expressed puzzlement that Lyndon Johnson was
willing to give up his powerful Senate post to become vice
president. Asked why, in light of that, he accepted Dukakis' offer,
Bentsen said he was ``convinced that I could be a trusted adviser
to the next president of the United States, and that's one of the
major responsibilities that a public official can fill.''
   Bentsen and Dukakis were traveling to Texas for a rally together
on Sunday, the day before the opening of the Democratic National
Convention.

   Mayor Eugene Sawyer consolidated his power with a
shakeup of committee chairmanships Wednesday night during a raucous
City Council meeting at which an opponent said Sawyer ``declared
war in the black community.''
   With Sawyer's blessing, his allies stripped his top political
rival in the black community, Alderman Timothy Evans, of
chairmanship of the Finance Committee, and dumped at least three
other black aldermen out of key posts.
   The reorganization was adopted on a vote of 26-17, with Sawyer,
who is black, relying on votes from white aldermen.
   Opponents of the mayor, most of them black, said the realignment
would add fuel to Evans' probable mayoral run in 1989.
   Only 15 months ago, black aldermen were united when the late
Mayor Harold Washington, the city's first black mayor, was
re-elected. But since Washington's death last November, and
Sawyer's elevation from alderman to acting mayor, black political
figures have divided their allegiance between Sawyer and Evans.
   ``Mr. Mayor, I think you've made a terrible mistake,'' said
Alderman Danny Davis, a black who lost chairmanship of the Zoning
Committee. ``It looks like everything we fought for, that Harold
Washington died for, is being turned back.
   ``What we have seen is an evil, sinister plot,'' added Davis,
himself mentioned as a possible mayoral candidate. ``It's a dark
day in the City of Chicago. I guess you and your colleagues have
declared war in the black community.''
   But Alderman Michael Sheahan, a white Sawyer supporter, said the
mayor was trying for a ``real balanced reorganization.''
   If Sawyer did not reorganize, Sheahan said, ``that's
surrendering.''
   Sawyer said he had to act ``to move the city ahead.''
   ``We have an agenda to move, a city to run,'' he said. ``They
have another agenda and it's not mine.''
   As part of the council committee reshuffling, Alderman Larry
Bloom, a white opponent of Sawyer who has his own mayoral
ambitions, lost chairmanship of the Budget Committee to Alderman
Lemuel Austin, a Sawyer supporter.
   The Housing Committee, formerly chaired by Sawyer opponent
Alderman Dorothy Tillman, was turned over to Alderman Sheneather
Butler.
   The meeting was punctuated by protests from the gallery as
various aldermen rose to defend or criticize the committee
reassignments. At one point, near the end of the meeting, police
officers rushed to the floor to break up a near-fight between Ms.
Tillman and Alderman Marlene Carter.
   Many of the audience members shouted, ``Go home, Uncle Tom!'' to
some of the black aldermen who defended the purge.
   A special election is scheduled next April to fill the final two
years of Washington's four-year term. Sawyer has said he will run,
and Evans has all but declared his own candidacy.

<TEXT>
   A two-year struggle between management and
employees of The Washington Post has taken a new turn, with a union
representing the paper's workers alleging that the Post
discriminates against women, minorities and older workers.
   The Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild, which represents 1,400
reporters, editors, and business department workers at the Post,
filed a discrimination complaint with the District of Columbia
Office of Human Rights on Wednesday.
   The union alleges that women and minorities have been treated
unfairly in pay and promotion decisions, and charges that the Post
has steered older, higher-salaried reporters and editors toward
retirement.
   Those charges were quickly denied by Post officials.
   ``The Post doesn't discriminate against any of its employees,''
said Bo Jones, legal counsel for The Washington Post Cos.
``Salaries are based on individual merit.''
   Post reporters make an average of $55,000 per year, he said.
   The district's Human Rights Office, which has subpoena power
over wage, hiring and promotional records, cannot force the Post to
make changes in its procedures, but could freeze various city funds
and services the newspaper enjoys if it rules that the union
complaint has merit. Such a finding would also strengthen any civil
lawsuit the union might file against the paper.
   ``We don't think it's too much to ask for this great newspaper
to investigate charges of discrimination in its own backyard,''
said Jill Nelson, an editor on the paper's Sunday magazine who
serves as the paper's union representative.
   The guild's complaint was filed on the second day of a protest
in which most Post reporters withheld bylines from their stories to
draw attention to a lack of progress in contract negotiations.
Employees at the paper have been working without a contract for two
years.
   The major contract dispute has been over a wage agreement
reached in the 1970s that gave incumbent reporters hefty pay raises
but did not accordingly adjust wage levels for future newcomers.
   The union charges that merit pay increases _ over which union
officials have no control _ have been used to further separate new
white male reporters and editors from their black and female
counterparts.
   Jones said the Post has been working diligently to increase the
number of minorities and women in all departments, but
acknowledged, ``Among reporters, for example, you don't have many
blacks coming in at the David Broder level.
   ``If you look at salary levels at individual levels, you'll find
whites make more than blacks among reporters,'' Jones said. ``But
if you look at guild-covered editors, blacks make more than
whites.''
   The union claims black female reporters at the Post earn an
average of $170 less per week than their white male colleagues,
even when age and experience are taken into account. According to
figures compiled by the union, white male employees also enjoy
better pay rates than white female workers and other minorities.
   The union also charged that the Post's percentage of minority
employees is insufficient, while Jones claimed that 16 percent of
newsroom staff is made up of minorities, and 26 percent of new
hires in the past two years have been black. Hiring of females also
has tailed off in recent years, the union charged.

<HEAD>House Waves Big Trade Bill Through Amid Forecasts Reagan Will Sign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new trade bill that has been stripped of a
plant-closings notification feature is headed for the Senate amid
predictions that President Reagan will sign it barring major
changes.
   Republican Leader Robert H. Michel, R-Ill., said through an aide
after the House approved the measure 376-45 on Wednesday that ``the
president will definitely sign it'' provided the Senate does not
drastically alter the bill.
   ``He really has to sign it, otherwise he will cause political
problems for the (Republican) party,'' Rep. Robert Matsui,
D-Calif., said after the bill won its strongest House support in
two years of seesaw combat over the issue.
   Only four Democrats and 41 Republicans held out against the bill.
   Reagan vetoed an earlier version May 24, and within hours the
House voted 308-113 to pass it over the president's objections. It
had cleared 312-107 in April in its best showing until Wednesday.
   Senate efforts to pass the measure over Reagan's opposition
failed June 8 to get the two-thirds needed for a veto override.
   Since then, however, lawmakers have dropped a provision that
would require companies to give employees 60-day notice of
impending plant closings and large-scale layoffs. Reagan singled
out the provision in his veto message, saying it would rob managers
of the flexibility to maintain their firms in peak economic health.
Sponsors called notification humane and decent.
   In another move to meet Reagan's objections, the House deleted
curbs on export of Alaska oil that were contained in the bill.
   Before taking up the trade bill, the House approved the
plant-closings notification plan 286-136 as a separate piece of
legislation and will now send that Senate-passed measure to the
president's desk.
   In another preliminary move, the House rejected 237-183 a Michel
effort to drop features providing duty-free imports of ethanol
produced at Caribbean refineries from European and Brazilian
alcohol-based products, including wine.
   The bill would overhaul the system under which the United States
imposes import restrictions to protect U.S. industries and
retaliate against international trade violations.
   There would be sanctions against Toshiba Corp. of Japan and
Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk of Norway for selling submarine-silencing
technology to the Soviet Union.
   Depending on the outcome of the Uruguay Round of international
trade negotiations and other factors, the measure could generate
more than $2 billion in agricultural subsidies.
   The 1980 windfall profits tax on oil company earnings would be
repealed. The measure would authorize $980 million in the fiscal
year starting Oct. 1 and more funds later for retraining of workers
left jobless by plant closings, layoffs and other disruptions
whether or not they were trade-related.
   A vast array of other features can be found in the 1,000-page
document that has been wending its way through Capitol Hill in one
form or another since the trade debate started hearing up in 1984.
   The reason at that time was record trade deficits and related
job losses in industries hard hit by competition from imports.
Since then, the situation has changed. Unemployment is at a 14-year
low of 5.3 percent, and the monthly trade deficit has been sinking.

<TEXT>
   House and Senate leaders are presenting
similar versions of what they say is long-overdue acid rain
legislation that stands a good chance of passing this year.
   ``For seven years, we have supported legislation to control acid
rain,'' Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, said at a news conference
Wednesday to announce a tentative acid rain plan agreed to by 27
senators. ``Three times in this decade the Committee on Environment
and Public Works has reported such legislation ... but thus far,
the legislation has not been considered in the Senate.''
   On the other side of the Capitol, Rep. Sherwood Boehlert,
R-N.Y., was joined by Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste, New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo and three Ohio congressmen when he announced
legislation patterned after a compromise reached by the two
governors last month.
   Both plans call for a 10-million-ton reduction in sulfur dioxide
emissions from old coal-fired utility plants, as compared to a
12-million-ton reduction called for in amendments to the Clean Air
Act now stalled in the Senate. The Boehlert bill would give
utilities 15 years to comply, while the Senate plan gives them 12.
   Figuring that it will cost about $1.8 billion a year to reduce
emissions, the Boehlert bill proposes that polluters pay half that
cost, the oil industry pay $650 million a year through fees to the
federal government for oil storage, and the federal government pay
the remaining $250 million annually.
   The Senate measure suggests a cost-sharing effort tied to the
amount of electricity generated but giving credit to those states
that have already implemented acid rain controls.
   The Senate measure is not yet in the form of a bill, but
Mitchell said it probably would be introduced as an amendment to an
appropriate legislative vehicle. He refused to be more specific.
   ``In terms of timing, we rule nothing in or out,'' he said. ``We
will do it at the time that seems most opportune for advancing this
legislation.''
   He said he would drop efforts to get a vote on the existing
amendments to the Clean Air Act, stalled in the Senate since last
November.
   He also said he did not anticipate the usual roadblocks to acid
rain legislation, such as the opposition of Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., who has protected interests of his state's auto industry,
or Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who represents a
large coal-mining state.
   ``From the standpoint of an opponent, this may be a very
opportune time to act,'' Mitchell said, noting that both apparent
presidential candidates have voiced support for acid rain
legislation.
   Byrd is studying the plan, but ``As of this time, we do not have
the support of Sen. Byrd,'' Mitchell noted.
   Several senators expressed reservation about cost-sharing,
details of which are still being worked out.
   ``I firmly believe that polluters should pay to clean up their
dirty facilities,'' Sen. Gordon J. Humphrey, R-N.H., said. ``I
endorse this new approach to acid rain control which includes a
cost-sharing proposal in the hope that this compromise may finally
have what it takes to enact effective acid rain controls.''
   But Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., called the plan ``the fairest
way, cost-wise.'' He estimated that in Western states, utility
customers might see another 30 cents to 40 cents on their monthly
bills while in a state like Massachusetts, people might expect to
pay another 80 cents.
   For the most part, the legislators were upbeat about the chances
of passing a bill, now that Ohio and New York have put forward a
solution.
   ``Every passing day brings another indication that Congress is
serious about meeting its responsibilities to act on acid rain,''
Cuomo said. ``Today, you've seen two very big indications.''
   Sulfur dioxide emissions from the burning of coal have been
blamed as a major cause of acid rain, which environmentalists say
is destroying waters and woodlands in the Northeast. Much of the
sulfur dioxide comes from coal-burning power plants along the Ohio
River.

   A popular deliveryman who funded his
own basketball program in an effort to keep young men off the
streets was fatally shot, allegedly by a man whose three nephews
played on his team, police said.
   Herman Bates Jr., 50, was killed in a dispute that began and
ended in his front yard.
   ``He was like a father to a lot of kids in the community,'' said
Jeff Prothro, the coach's nephew and a former player. ``He'd keep
them off the streets, keep them from getting in trouble.''
   The incident began when Bates and two of his three sons, Ronald
and Rickie, walked outside their San Mateo home about 9:30 p.m.
Monday to check some noise.
   They found James and Jimmy Pryor, two brothers who had been
noisily drinking in a car parked over the sidewalk and partly on
Bates' lawn, said San Mateo police Sgt. Phil Derr.
   When Bates and his two sons requested the men to leave, there
was a pushing match between Rickie Bates and Jimmy Pryor, whose
three sons had played at various times on a Herman Bates team, said
Derr.
   The Pryors lived in the neighborhood and there was no ``bad
blood'' between the two families, Protho said.
   The brothers left and returned within minutes with a .44-caliber
Magnum rifle. James Pryor fired three shots, including one that hit
Bates in the heart, said Derr.
   Derr said the Bates brothers managed to get the rifle, and then
beat up Jimmy Pryor. Derr said Jimmy Pryor was taken to Mills
Memorial Hospital, where he told police that his 43-year-old
brother, James, had fired the shots.
   James Pryor was arraigned on murder charges Wednesday in San
Mateo.
   Bates started the basketball program eight years ago for his own
sons and other teen-agers and young men, his nephew said.

   Needy New York state students will begin
getting a guaranteed free public college education beginning in
1991 under a program agreed to Wednesday by Gov. Mario Cuomo and
legislative leaders.
   Under the Liberty Scholarship program, students entering a New
York college in fall 1991 whose families have a gross adjusted
income of $18,000 or less would be given a scholarship worth the
difference between other grants they receive and their full college
costs including such things as books and transportation.
   The value of the scholarship would be geared to the average
tuition costs at State University of New York schools, but would be
available for students who chose to go instead to private colleges
in New York.
   That means that if a student was eligible for a $4,000 Liberty
Scholarship and decided to go to a private college where the annual
costs were $15,000, the student would still only get a $4,000
scholarship.
   ``We believe this is the most comprehensive and first program of
its kind in the United States,'' said Cuomo press secretary Gary
Fryer.
   When first proposed by Cuomo earlier this year, the Liberty
Scholarship idea was questioned by some legislators who said their
middle-class constituents might not look kindly on it. Cuomo said
that those who opposed it were being ``selfish.''
   The program is expected to be approved by the Legislature before
it ends it regular session, possibly as early as the end of this
week.
   The Liberty Scholarships, a key Cuomo initiative this year,
would be available at a reduced level for students from families
with annual incomes up to $26,000. Fryer said about 94,000
scholarships would be awarded when the program is fully implemented.

<HEAD>FAA Inspections Found Trouble With Aloha's Maintenance Records</HEAD>

   A team investigating why an 18-foot section of an
airplane ripped off in flight said Wednesday a number of
discrepancies in Aloha Airlines' records indicated problems with
aircraft were noted but no record was made of corrections.
   Lonnie R. Giles, leader of a Federal Aviation Administration
inspection team, said Aloha's structural inspection program and its
compliance with FAA airworthiness directives were reviewed in a
special inspection in May.
   The review followed the April 28th incident in which a portion
of the fuselage on a Boeing 737 peeled off on a flight from Hilo to
Honolulu, exposing the first-class section to the open air at
24,000 feet.
   The pilot and co-pilot managed to land the crippled jet 13
minutes later in Maui although one of the two engines quit. A
flight attendant died in the accident.
   The National Transportation Safety Board heard testimony
Wednesday about two FAA reports critical of Aloha's maintenance
operations.
   In one example, the FAA inspection team said a Jan. 5 Aloha
document described two rivets being popped on a window post of a
737.
   The document's corrective action section is stamped: ``Inspected
and determined OK for further service, transcribed for further
rework.''
   The FAA report said the missing rivet item again appeared on a
Jan. 15 Aloha document with an additional note that the ``window
must be removed.'' The same document also described missing
fasteners just behind the window post.
   The FAA report said neither of the discrepancy reports showed
any corrective actions, and when the FAA inspected the aircraft on
May 9 inspectors noted the rivets were still missing.
   Henry Arii, Aloha vice president of quality control and
assurance, said in an interview that in all such instances cited,
interim repairs were made to keep the planes airworthy until the
problems could be permanently fixed. He said that because Aloha
used a unique system for tracking repairs, the FAA did not realize
the temporary repairs had been made.
   The airplane in question was taken out of service in the spring.
The FAA report did not specify the exact date.
   Aloha spokesman Milton Goto said the plane in question was
rebuilt, inspected and returned to service.
   The FAA team said Aloha's record-keeping system for compliance
with FAA airworthiness directives lacked continuity and consistency.
   Airworthiness directives are orders by the FAA to inspect and
correct problems in aircraft.
   ``The paper trace to determine actual method of compliance was
very difficult and time-consuming,'' the FAA report said.
   However the report said that after ``much diligent and tedious
research'' the team found satisfactory evidence of compliance with
the directives.
   A separate FAA team inspected Aloha's maintenance program in
December as part of a national aviation safety program that looked
at a number of airlines.
   The FAA's Dec. 21 report found, among other things, maintenance
officials at Aloha had ``been remiss in their responsibilities by
not being able to recognize their own deficiencies ...''
   The FAA said maintenance managers were asked to furnish
information about Aloha's aircraft maintenance reliability program.
   ``The end result was the reliability documents requested could
not be furnished, because they are non-existent,'' according to the
report.
   In an April 21 update, the FAA team said Aloha had submitted a
new reliability program and acted to correct other problems found
in the inspection.
   The NTSB inquiry board also questioned FAA officials about
whether they should put more emphasis on ``hands-on'' aircraft
inspections, rather than reviewing airline maintenance documents,
in looking for possible problems.
   ``We do review a lot of paperwork,'' Giles said, ``I try to
temper mine with a lot of on-site inspection.''
   Giles acknowledged there's not necessarily a correlation between
well-kept documents and well-kept aircraft. ``To get a good,
complete picture, you have to look at both.''
   Each carrier has the primary responsibility for ensuring its
planes are safe, but Giles said that he personally has grounded
planes he thought unairworthy.

   The operators of a pair of restaurants are
hoping to have their patrons ``swigging in the rain'' with an offer
to pour free champagne the next time it rains for more than 30
minutes.
   ``When it rains, we pour,'' Phil Powell, spokesman for the Park
House restaurants, said Tuesday.
   Richard Schaffer, manager of one Park House north of Pittsburgh,
said if the drought continues throughout the summer the two
restaurants probably will make more than one offer to have
customers ``swigging in the rain.''
   ``But if it rains seven days in a row, I don't think we'll do
it,'' he said.
   State officials have asked Pennsylvania residents to cut back on
water usage 5 percent because of this summer's drought, one of the
worst ever to hit the nation.

   How do you keep 45 gallons of ice cream
in a 167-foot-long banana split from melting on a sunny Arkansas
afternoon?
   You arm 167 hungry Cub Scouts with plastic spoons.
   The lengthy dessert is a tradition at the annual Boy Scout
Jamboree. Day camp director Kay Morris has forgotten the first year
of the long split, but remembers the length.
   ``We started with 50 feet and have increased it every year,''
she said. ``We try to break our old record each year.''
   Camp staffers created the split Wednesday along a foil-covered
gutter using 45 gallons of ice cream, three three gallons of
chocolate syrup, two gallons of cherries, 15 cans of whipped cream
and a case of bananas.
   Because of the number of staffers involved, the concoction's
creation took only 10 minutes. Its consumption took the Cubs a
little longer.
   ``I'm eating like a pig,'' said 6-year-old John Starks of Fort
Smith, his face covered and his hair matted with ice cream and
chocolate sauce. He explained that after losing his spoon in the
giant treat, he bent over the ice cream and used his mouth. Moments
later, he spotted his spoon and plunged his hand in to retrieve it.
   A hose squad from the Fort Chaffee Fire Department eased the
cleanup.

   Hollywood has gone to the dogs _ and so
has Glamour.
   Glamour magazine, that is. Its search for the ugliest dog in the
land led to a 53-pound bulldog named Dewey.
   His owners, Ellen and Bob Durfee, think their pooch is a peach.
   ``His looks are his personality,'' Ms. Durfee said.
   But they won't turn down the $50 prize that goes along with the
honor Glamour bestowed on Dewey.
   The dog was the unanimous choice of the magazine's Ugly Dog
Competition judges, beating out canines decked out in sunglasses
and bikinis.
   ``It was his face,'' executive editor Rona Cherry said Tuesday.
``You look at it and say `Oh my, that's an ugly dog.'''
   Dewey's mug graces the August issue of Glamour, which goes on
sale this week.
   The Durfees breed and show 3-year-old Dewey, who lives with them
and two other bulldogs, Winston and Lady.
   Dewey can only do one trick, Ms. Durfee said. He can sit while
wearing a hat.
   ``That's only after his nap, though,'' she said.
   Even if he's been proclaimed the ugliest dog in the nation, Ms.
Durfee says everyone doesn't find him unattractive.
   ``He's going to be a daddy any day now,'' she said.

   The toilet tissue crisis is over at the
historic Canton courthouse, thanks to the delivery of five cases of
fluffy white tissue, which ended a much-discussed drought of the
restroom item.
   ``We're smiling a lot more around here now,'' said Chancery
Clerk Billy Cooper, who last week dug into his own pocket to buy
tissue for paper-depleted restrooms.
   The county's supply of toilet tissue dried up last week because
the product was temporarily out-of-stock at the Jackson firm that
holds the state-approved contract for two-ply toilet tissue.
   ``It got so bad for paper we pulled out last year's tax rolls,''
Tax Assessor Gerald Barber said in jest.
   Madison County supervisors applauded word that relief was at
hand. ``I know everybody feels better around here now,'' said
superviors' President J.S. ``Brother'' Harris.

   Polish television has served viewers a
full menu of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's encounters with
eager crowds of Poles, who offer flowers or urge him to autograph a
copy of his book.
   But the gatherings are less spontaneous than they seem.
   Flower merchant Jozefa Paslawska pointed to the four copies of
the book ``Perestroika'' on Soviet reforms, prominently displayed
in front of her flowers.
   ``It will be a big souvenir when he signs it,'' she said.
   Ms. Paslawska did not show up on the Krakow market square
Tuesday by accident.
   Like the rest of the hundreds of Poles who closed in on
Gorbachev when he emerged from a sumptuous lunch in the freshly
painted Wierzynek restaurant in the southern city, her presence had
been carefully planned.
   According to protocol, Polish security has the upper hand in
arranging Gorbachev's safety during the six-day visit, which began
Monday.
   In doing so, it has also made sure Poles who might raise
Solidarity banners or flash the two-fingered ``V'' sign of the
banned free trade union movement are kept far from Gorbachev.
   As a result, the `spontaneous' meetings are artificial.
   The desire to avoid incidents that might embarrass communist
authorities was evident in Krakow, which has an active branch the
pro-Solidarity Independent Students' Union and where workers in
nearby Nowa Huta went on strike in April during Poland's worst
labor unrest since a 1981 military crackdown suspended Solidarity.
   Blue-uniformed police began emptying Krakow's medieval market
square, one of Europe's largest, and blocked the small streets
leading to the square six hours before Gorbachev arrived on Tuesday.
   Those allowed to cross police barriers had special invitations
from their factories. When the Soviet leader toured the square,
plainclothesmen with special blue-and-white badges locked arms and
formed a second barrier in addition to Gorbachev's regular guards.
   The civilian guards ringed the entrance to St. Mary's Roman
Catholic church, which Gorbachev visited for about 20 minutes. Even
pre-selected guests were bumped back by the guards.
   Polish government spokesman Jerzy Urban said the tight control
was necessary to avoid traffic snarls.
   The places Gorbachev visits have been carefully chosen for their
symbolic value.
   On Wednesday, he visited the Warski shipyard in the Baltic port
of Szczecin, a former Solidarity stronghold.
   The 3,000 Workers who heared him speak were required to have an
invitation from their place of work and only about a third actually
worked at the shipyard. The workers showed little enthusiasm when
Gorbachev spoke.
   Not all the situations were artificial.
   Outside the Lenin museum in Poronin, a southern mountain village
where Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin spent several summers before
World War I, Gorbachev spoke to a crowd that included casually
dressed vacationers.
   Security even allowed a little boy with a camera to run around
and inspect the impressive fleet of black limousines that powered
the Gorbachev party up the winding hills to Poronin on Tuesday.
   However, the crowd allowed to watch Gorbachev lay a wreath in
front of a statue of Lenin inside the museum consisted of local
party officials and the local military honor guard.
   Not all those privileged to see Gorbachev were impressed.
   Merchants in Krakow's market square complained that their
flowers had wilted for lack of customers.
   And a group of East German tourists who accidentally found
themselves on the square did not stay for a glimpse of Gorbachev.
   ``He has his picture taken and taken, but he never does
anything,'' said one before the group trouped off.

Stuff</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the waning hours of Michael Dukakis' search for
a running mate, it came down to two _ John Glenn and Lloyd Bentsen.
   And both, in Dukakis' mind, had the right stuff.
   The two senators each offered Washington experience. Either
would bring ideological and geographical balance to the Democratic
ticket. Both have moderate to conservative voting records and both
are well respected in Congress.
   Glenn, the Ohio senator, the astronaut and hero, likely would
deliver his state's 23 electoral college votes to Dukakis. Bentsen,
the silver-haired Texas senator, the quintessential Washington
insider, might help carry his state's 29 electoral votes.
   On the negative side, neither is considered a dazzling
campaigner. Both had made unsuccessful presidential bids, Bentsen's
a short-lived venture in 1976 and Glenn's a failed 1984 effort
marked by well-publicized disarray and a huge remaining debt.
   As Dukakis prepared to make his choice Monday night, sources
said, the focus essentially had narrowed to Glenn and Bentsen. But
Rep. Lee Hamilton of Indiana and to a lesser degree Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. of Tennessee were still in contention.
   Stacked up against Glenn, Bentsen emerged as the victor based on
his Senate record and the strategic implications of his inclusion
on the ticket, sources said, winning out over the heroic legacy of
the Ohioan most had considered the favorite for the Democratic vice
presidential nomination.
   Dukakis aides also believe he is already a strong contender in
the Midwest and that the key to the election is attracting Reagan
Democrats back to the party.
   As part of the detailed background checks directed by Dukakis
confidant Paul Brountas, the campaign had compiled an unimpressive
portrait of the 1984 Glenn presidential effort, which was in
serious trouble even before Iowa's all-important caucuses. Several
people involved in that campaign live in the Boston area and were
easily accessible to the Brountas research team.
   With Dukakis, his wife, Brountas and two top campaign aides
assembled at Dukakis' kitchen table, the unanimous choice was
Bentsen.
   ``If the pick is between two near equals, why not take the one
that causes George Bush the most grief?'' offered one senior
Dukakis adviser. Bush claims Texas as his home state, and the
choice of Bentsen by Dukakis was a deliberate effort to force Bush
to invest time and money in a state he may have taken for granted.
   Bentsen, as Senate Finance Committee chairman, plays a leading
role in the chamber's handling of major legislation and this year
alone has been a key figure in the consideration of trade and
catastrophic health care bills.
   ``Both had the stature we were looking for, but Bentsen is more
of a doer, has more accomplishments,'' another adviser said. ``That
was appealing to Michael.''
   Dukakis said from the outset of the search that his vice
president would be an active player and trusted adviser, and
Bentsen was seen in the Dukakis camp as fitting that role better
than Glenn.
   Dukakis himself hinted at that when explaining on Wednesday why
he picked Bentsen to fill the ticket.
   ``I picked this man because in my judgment he had those
qualities, the strength, character, the values, the experience that
would be most helpful, not just in running and winning but in
serving in office and putting together as fine an administration as
we possibly could,'' Dukakis told a Capitol Hill news conference.
   The choice of Bentsen also was partly attributed to the
withdrawal of two attractive candidates from consideration: Georgia
Sen. Sam Nunn and New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley.
   With Nunn out of the running, speculation about a running mate
from the South turned to Bentsen, Gore and Florida Sen. Bob Graham.
   Graham, sources said, did not have the Washington and national
political experience Dukakis sought, and Gore would proven a
sensitive choice because Jackson was pushing for the No. 2 spot and
had outlasted Gore in the presidential primaries.
   That problem also dimmed the prospects of Missouri Rep. Richard
Gephardt.
   Jackson has no government experience, and his flamboyant
personality clashes with Dukakis' reserved nature. He was never
considered a serious vice presidential possibility, and The Boston
Globe reported Wednesday that he hurt his already dim chances by
refusing to fully comply with Brountas' request for financial
information.
   Hamilton, like Bradley, developed a good rapport with Dukakis,
and some believe Dukakis would have turned to the Indiana
congressman if there was division over the Bentsen-Glenn choice.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis sought Wednesday to emphasize
the economic issues of jobs and growth he and his vice presidential
choice, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, agree on. But the two men
differ on a range of other issues.
   Among them:
   NICARAGUA _ Bentsen, like many southern Democrats, has
consistently voted in favor of the Reagan administration's requests
to provide military aid to the Contra rebels fighting Nicaragua's
leftist Sandinista government. He has said he believes force is the
only way to pressure Managua into making democratic reforms.
Dukakis opposes Contra aid, instead preferring diplomatic solutions
to Nicaragua's political problems.
   REAGANOMICS _ Bentsen, as a member of the tax-writing Senate
Finance Committee, supported President Reagan's successful 1981
cuts in individual income taxes. ``I really thought taxes should be
cut,'' Bentsen said Wednesday, adding that concerns about a
mounting federal deficit had prompted him to vote against the third
and final increment of the tax cut. Dukakis has termed the cuts ``a
disgrace'' that led to huge deficits and damaged the U.S. trade
balance.
   OIL _ As an oil-state lawmaker, Bentsen has consistently sought
preferential tax treatment for the petroleum industry and has
favored an oil import fee, positions diametrically at odds with
attitudes in the oil-consuming Northeast and with Dukakis' stance.
   SCHOOL PRAYER _ Bentsen has voted in favor of a constitutional
amendment to allow organized prayer in public schools. Dukakis
opposes it.
   WEAPONS _ Bentsen has supported the modernization of the U.S.
strategic force, including votes for the B-1 bomber and the MX
missile. Dukakis opposes both weapons systems.
   BALANCED BUDGET _ Bentsen voted for a constitutional amendment
requiring Congress to adopt a balanced budget every year except in
wartime, or if three-fifths of members approve of waiving the
requirement. Dukakis opposes such an amendment.
   DEATH PENALTY _ Bentsen generally supports imposition of the
death penalty and has voted for it in the Senate. Dukakis is
opposed to the death penalty.

   A couple who lost five children in an
apartment fire 25 years ago is now mourning with the death of their
17-ear-old son _ shot in what police said was a game of Russian
roulette.
   ``We're trying to get through this and we're praying to the good
Lord, but it's pretty tough,'' said Bessie Milton, whose
17-year-old son Edward died after being shot in the eye.
   ``We lost five children in a fire in Chicago in 1963 and the
Lord blessed me with five more children,'' Mrs. Milton, 46, said
Wednesday. ``Now I've lost my baby. Hopefully, the good Lord will
pull me through again.''
   The teen-ager's shooting death Saturday is the latest tragedy to
scar a family all too familiar with death.
   L.D. and Bessie Milton were in the process of buying a house in
1963 when a boiler in their South Side apartment building exploded.
   The couple had left their five small children in the care of a
neighbor who lived upstairs from their basement apartment. The
Milton children _ four girls and a boy _ all died in the resulting
blaze.
   The Miltons, who have been married 29 years, rebuilt their
family with four boys and a girl, and moved to Peoria in 1974 where
Milton works as a musician. They live in public housing in Peoria's
poor south side.
   ``My oldest would have been 29 years old now and my baby was
17,'' Mrs. Milton said. ``I had a nervous breakdown two years after
the fire, but I turned my life around. I hope I can get through
this.''
   Mrs. Milton is angry at the youth accused of shooting her
promising son. ``My son was outgoing _ he would do anything for
anyone,'' she said.
   ``He worked at a restaurant, owned his own car and was going to
graduate from Manual High School next year. He was a good student
and he talked about going to college. He was even in the ROTC. He
was a good boy and was never any trouble.''
   David L. Gaines, 17, was charged with first-degree murder and
remained in jail on $100,000 bond Wednesday. Police say he shot
Edward Milton in the right eye early Saturday in a game of Russian
roulette that involved at least four youths.
   In Russian roulette, a revolver's cylinder is loaded with one
cartridge, the cylinder spun and the trigger pulled.
   Prosecutors said Gaines pointed the gun at the heads of two
other youths and pulled the trigger, but the weapon didn't fire
until it was Milton's turn.

   From friendly, down-home fried-chicken bashes to
elegant, exclusive soirees, hundreds of festive gatherings here
next week will bring new meaning to the term party politics.
   Southern hospitality will be on national display as the city
opens its homes, museums, gardens and parks to thousands of
reporters and delegates to the Democratic National Convention.
   As many as 35,000 visitors will make the rounds of breakfasts,
brunches, dinners, receptions, picnics, parties, fashion shows,
dances and train rides throughout the weekend and during the
convention.
   On Friday, before the bulk of the convention-goers arrive, 6,000
volunteer workers will get a break with a party and a music and
laser show at Stone Mountain Park. Dining on a nearby paddle boat
at the suburban Atlanta park will be 500 Democratic National
Committee staffers, who will ride to their party in a steam engine
train on a newly opened railroad track.
   The partying will be non-stop on Saturday and Sunday, when the
majority of delegates, reporters and the nation's Democratic
politicians converge on Atlanta.
   On Saturday, reporters are invited to a brunch at Zoo Atlanta, a
reception at the Carter Center and a Carribean-music dance at a
downtown nightclub. They'll also hear rock star Stephen Stills and
jazz artist Grover Washington at the official host committee's
party for 9,000 journalists at the huge Georgia World Congress
Center.
   For those who want to work off their party excesses, the
Democratic National Committee is sponsoring a celebrity tennis
tournament Saturday, while Mort Zuckerman, editor-in-chief of U.S.
News & World Report, is distributing special week-long passes to
the Downtown Athletic Club to about 200 political leaders and media
heavies.
   Baseball great Hank Aaron, Atlanta Hawks basketball star
Dominique Wilkins and singer Peabo Bryson are among the ``celebrity
conductors'' on ``Maynard's Midnight Train To Georgia'' late
Saturday night. Former Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson, an
unannounced candidate for mayor again in 1989, is taking about 900
politicians and supporters on a $100-a-ticket midnight train ride
around the city.
   Jackson's campaign fund-raiser and a BellSouth Inc. party for
the DNC staff are among several events planned on the state-owned
train operating out of the Georgia Freight Depot, about the oldest
surviving building in a city founded in the 1830s as a railroad
transportation hub.
   For the convention-week parties, the Georgia Building
Authority's 1910 steam engine or one of the state agency's three
diesel engines will be hooked up to 21 party cars _ total capacity
1,000 _ for rides on an 18-mile north Atlanta loop or on the new
track to Stone Mountain Park.
   The party pace grows frenzied on Sunday, with a series of
receptions followed by 56 parties for individual state delegations.
   One of the more coveted Sunday invitations is to a party at the
city's white-tiled High Museum of Art sponsored by Cox Enterprises
Inc., owner of The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution,
for 3,000 party leaders and media luminaries.
   Peach tarts, peach cheesecake, peach ice cream, peach sorbet,
chocolate-covered peach truffles and peach shortcake are on the
party's dessert menu. Dinner includes plantation ham on sweet
potato biscuits; Sea Island souffle of shrimp, crab and clams;
sausage balls with pear chutney; Savannah shrimp salad; fried
chicken; barbeque and Plains boiled peanuts.
   Mint juleps will be served with dinner in the Victorian
neighborhood of Inman Park at a party for U.S. House members
sponsored by Rep. John Lewis, Atlanta's Democratic congressman.
   Historical Jonesboro is planning a party featuring three bands
and women in antebellum costumes for the Maryland delegation. It
will be held at Stately Oaks, a restored mansion in the south
Atlanta suburb that served as the fictional Tara plantation in
``Gone With The Wind.''
   Before the convention starts Monday night, Atlanta Mayor Andrew
Young will give a brunch for journalists at Spelman College.
Young's late-night reception Monday at the Marriott Marquis hotel,
a convention headquarters hotel, is one of the few public evening
events scheduled after the convention sessions, which are expected
to run from 6 p.m. to midnight Monday through Thursday.
   But there will be plenty of daytime entertainment _ ranging from
a fried chicken picnic lunch for 4,000 on Tuesday at the Martin
Luther King Jr. Center for Non-violent Social Change to a pig-roast
reception for 6,000 on the grounds of the state Capitol on
Wednesday.
   For those wanting more intellectual pursuits, Atlanta's thriving
arts community is sponsoring plays, exhibits and concerts aimed
particularly at the convention audience.
   The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra's Wednesday afternoon performance
at the ornate Fox Theater will be conducted by Harry Ellis Dickson,
former associate conductor of the Boston Pops and father-in-law of
Michael Dukakis. The hour-long program will be introduced by
Dickson's daughter, Kitty Dukakis.
   And all those connected with the convention _ an estimated
35,000 _ will be welcome at the Thursday night closing gala, a
victory celebration expected to fill the cavernous Georgia World
Congress Center.

<HEAD>Senate Approves $10 Billion Spending Bill Despite Veto Threat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate approval of a $10 billion spending bill
for the Interior Department is being greeted with the threat of a
presidential veto because of what the White House budget office
says is excessive spending.
   The 92-4 vote, however, was far more than the two-thirds tally
needed to override a veto. The Senate bill exceeds Reagan's budget
request by $1.2 billion, and would boost current spending by $747.6
million.
   The measure now goes to a House-Senate conference committee,
which will reconcile differences with a $9.69 billion version of
the bill approved by the House on June 29 for fiscal 1989, which
begins Oct. 1.
   James Miller, director of the Office of Management and Budget,
sent word he will recommend that President Reagan veto the bill
unless his objections are resolved.
   Miller complained of excessive spending under the Senate bill
for $526 million worth of energy conservation grants, land
acquisition, construction projects and Indian health facilities.
   Miller also protested the measure's proposed one-year moratorium
on sale of oil and gas leases off the coasts of northern California
and Massachusetts and resumption of such a ban off the Florida Gulf
Coast.
   The chamber also approved an amendment by Sen. Bennett Johnston,
D-La., eliminating a provision that would have accelerated by six
months, to Aug. 1, 1989, a Southern California lease sale involving
7 million acres of shoreline.
   Environmentalists had opposed that provision because of the
Senate Appropriations Committee's declaration that environmental
impact statements prepared for previous lease sales in the area
should be considered sufficient for this sale.
   The Senate voted to provide $525 million to support a Reagan
commitment to Canada to combat acid rain by developing technology
to reduce polluting emissions from coal burning.
   Miller had complained that the House backtracked on a
congressional commitment made last year by voting to slash the $525
million for clean coal research in fiscal 1989 to only $100 million.
   The House bill would provide additional sums of $225 million in
1990 and $200 million in the following year. The Senate deleted all
clean coal money for those later two years.
   Miller urged Congress to approve Reagan's request for $600
million each in 1990 and 1991 for clean coal projects before a
compromise bill is sent to the White House.
   The Senate deleted a House provision, strongly opposed by the
administration, that would require that at least 50 percent of
labor and materials used for offshore oil or gas rigs be made in
the United States.
   Both measures include $333.5 million to buy and transport oil to
fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but the Senate bill sets
$91.5 million of the money aside as an advance appropriation for
fiscal 1990.

<HEAD>Atmosphere Causes Wobble in Earth's Spin, Scientists Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's been known as terra firma through the
centuries, but scientists reported today that the Earth actually
wobbles slightly as it rotates, partly because of constant shifting
of air masses in the atmosphere.
   The wobble ranges up to only about two feet wide at the poles,
but its existence will let scientists use the Earth as a means to
studying the atmosphere, said researcher T. Marshall Eubanks.
   He said the phenomenon is like the quiver of a clothes washer
with an off-center load, with the shifting air masses acting like
the unbalanced laundry.
   An analysis is published in today's issue of the British journal
Nature by Eubanks of the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, and
scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.,
and Atmospheric and Environmental Research Inc., of Cambridge, Mass.
   They found that, over three years, the wobble was related to
changes in air pressure around the globe. Air pressure changes are
created by the shifting in the atmosphere, and Eubanks said
fluctuations as slight as one-tenth percent to three-tenths percent
of normal atmospheric pressure appeared to contribute to the wobble.
   Scientists have long known that the Earth's axis displays
regular oscillations lasting about 433 days and about a year, and
that the latter cycle is linked to the atmosphere.
   The new paper focuses on recently discovered fluctuations with
cycles of only two weeks to several months.
   The atmosphere's shiftings influence the Earth through changes
in air pressure at the planet's surface. Because the Earth bulges
around its equator, the weight of the atmosphere pushes not exactly
toward the center of the Earth but a little bit off-center, tending
to nudge the Earth off its rotational axis, Eubanks said in a
telephone interview.
   So, for example, if pressure is high over North America, low
over South America, high over Australia and low over Siberia, it
would tend to rotate the Earth as if a huge hand on North America
were pushing south, Eubanks said.
   That clearly seems to be the case for air pushing on land, but
the result of pushing on oceans is less understood, he said.
   Over long periods, ocean water responds to pressure by flowing
off to the side, dissipating the effect of the push much as a
waterbed responds if one slowly sinks a foot into it, he said.
   But the new analysis suggests that the atmosphere may still
exert some force through the oceans, he said. Perhaps the oceans
respond more like a waterbed being stomped on quickly, with a
complex sloshing back and forth that could still transmit pressure
to the Earth at the ocean floor, he said.
   The analysis found no contribution of winds to the fast wobble.
   The work largely explains the wobble but leaves some questions
unanswered, said Thomas Herring of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center
for Astrophysics in Cambridge. Only recently have researchers
gotten good enough data to demonstrate the link to the atmosphere,
he said in a telephone interview.
   Herring wrote in a Nature editorial that the effects of winds
and of air pressure over oceans are still open to debate, but that
they may contribute.
   He also said scientists have yet to discover what keeps the
433-day oscillation going. It measures an average of nearly 15 feet
wide at the poles.

   Seventy-seven percent of Britons can identify
Nelson Mandela, the jailed South African black leader, making him a
more familiar figure than most members of the British Cabinet,
according to a new Gallup poll.
   Apart from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Mandela scored a
higher recognition rating in the poll than did any British Cabinet
minister in a 1986 poll by Market Opinion and Research
International.
   Gallup made it easier with African National Congress leader
Mandela, mentioning his name _ as opposed to the MORI pollsters two
years ago who simply produced photographs and asked who it was.
   Even so, Mandela, serving a life sentence imposed in 1964 on
sabotage charges, emerged far ahead of the all-white, 22-member
Cabinet.
   Gallup spokesman Bob Wybrow said that if a respondent associated
the Mandela name with South Africa, or went further, that counted
as identification.
   In the 1986 poll, Mrs. Thatcher scored a 99.05 percent shutout.
   The Gallup poll was released Wednesday. It was commissioned by
the London-based Anti-Apartheid Movement to mark Mandela's 70th
birthday on Monday.

   Hundreds of unpublished love letters from ribald
American writer Henry Miller to Hollywood actress Brenda Venus, who
was 50 years his junior when they met, have surfaced at a London
auction.
   The letters will be sold later this month at Sotheby's as part
of the papers and books of the British novelist and poet Lawrence
Durrell, 76, a longtime friend of Miller.
   Miller, author of ``Tropic of Cancer,'' was 88 when he died in
California in 1980. Miss Venus and Miller met when she was in her
early 30s and Miller was 83.
   The letters, written from 1976 to 1979, vividly describe his
feelings for Miss Venus, who appeared in Clint Eastwood's 1975
movie ``The Eiger Sanction.''
   The friendship rejuvenated Miller, although Miss Venus rejected
his proposal of marriage. He went on to publish three more books
and poems and said of their relationship: ``How explain this
miraculous and fortuitous conjunction? How explain sunrise and
sunset, flood and drought?''

   Actor James Garner is making a ``remarkable''
recovery following artery surgery, an operation postponed three
months ago after doctors decided he needed an immediate quintuple
heart bypass.
   ``He is doing quite well,'' said Ron Wise, spokesman for
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. ``He is up, out of his bed, and
walking around in his room.''
   The Emmy-winning actor entered Cedars-Sinai last Thursday. The
surgery the following day was to correct an aneurysm, or weakness,
in the aorta, the main artery carrying blood from the heart.
   ``His recovery is remarkable. He is going to be released
probably by the end of the week, much earlier than previously
expected,'' said Wise.
   Garner, 60, starred in television's ``Maverick'' and ``The
Rockford Files,'' winning an Emmy for ``Rockford.'

   Pope John Paul II has embarked on his
second papal vacation, which he will spend in the cool of the
Dolomite Alps.
   The pope flew to northeastern Italy to begin his 10-day vacation
Wednesday in a mountain retreat in Lorenzago di Cadore, about 90
miles north of Venice, where he spent a week hiking last summer
during the first full-scale vacation of his papacy.
   The pope will interrupt his vacation to celebrate Mass Saturday
at a mountain altar at 10,500 feet, near the site of bitter
fighting between Italians and Austrians in World War I.
   On Sunday, he will visit a sanctuary in the predominantly
German-speaking Alto Adige, near Austria, then travel to the nearby
village of Stava where 269 people were killed when a dam collapsed
in 1985. He will bless a monument dedicated to the victims.

   The daughters of inventor Guglielmo Marconi are
on a visit from Italy to help build a floating museum that will be
a duplicate of the yacht that served as his home and laboratory.
   ``It is a timely and merited tribute to the man who ushered in
immediate worldwide communications,'' Gioia Marconi Braga said
Wednesday at a news conference held with her sister, Princess
Elettra Marconi Giovanelli.
   With $10 million of the $30 million construction cost raised
this far in Italy, work on the 253-foot Elettra II is to begin in
October and continue for three years, spokesmen for the project
said.
   Marconi invented wireless communication in the early 20th
century, worked in the development of short-wave radio and
conducted early experiments in what came to be radar.
   The first Elettra was destroyed during World War II. Its
duplicate, conceived by Italian yacht designer Franco Anselmi
Boretti, is to serve as a Marconi museum, an oceanographic research
vessel and a conference center.

<HEAD>Convention Cities Take Different Approach to Handle Costs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cities hosting the Democratic and Republican
national conventions are taking different approaches towards paying
for the expensive extravaganzas.
   Despite some charges of disorganization, Atlanta officials say
they're on their way to paying for the Democratic affair with help
from a $9 million check from the national party and a special tax
for motel and hotel rooms in the area through July 1990.
   The total tab for the Democratic National Convention next week
is expected to be $24 million, with the Georgia legislature and
some local banks expected to help raise funds for any shortfall in
payments.
   ``We have a nice cushion built in, in what we need to borrow and
what our interest revenues are going to be,'' said Bobby Kahn,
president of the Atlanta '88 organization set up to handle the
event.
   New Orleans, site of the Republican Convention on Aug. 15-18,
has struggled to come up with the funds to pay for security
measures, 5,000 upholstered chairs and the lighting and sound
systems for the Superdome.
   Fund-raising chief Ron Jones says he is banking on the fact
that, ``This has always been a town that gets its big hits late.''
   Mayor Sidney Barthelemy formed a second fund-raising committee
after complaints by the Greater New Orleans Convention Fund that
the first committee wasn't getting a fair share from big companies.

   The poll was taken Thursday through Sunday, before Dukakis named
Bentsen as his choice for the vice presidential nomination.
   It showed Dukakis with a slim 45-42 percent margin over
Republican nominee-to-be George Bush, a lead within the poll's
margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
   Asked who they would vote for if Bentsen were added to the

   Two protracted, debilitating
wars in southwestern Africa could end if agreement among South
Africa, Angola, and Cuba leads to a final settlement.
   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker, who mediated
the three-day talks in New York, said Wednesday that the parties
have agreed on principles aimed at removing Cuban troops from
Angola and ending South African rule in neighboring Namibia.
   Further talks will be needed. South Africa's chief delegate,
Neil van Heerden, told the state-run broadcasting company there is
``a long way to go.''
   However, the agreement on principles appeared to represent the
most significant progress yet toward resolving Angola's 13-year
civil war and obtaining independence for South-West Africa, also
known as Namibia.
   Guerrillas have been waging a bush war there against South
Africa rule since 1966.
   Here's a brief look at background of the two conflicts:
   ANGOLA:
   Civil war broke out in late 1975, months after the country
gained independence from Portugal. The rebels of UNITA _ the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ contended
that the Marxist faction that took power with Soviet help reneged
on an agreement to share power in advance of elections.
   UNITA has since been fighting with the help of South Africa and,
more recently, the United States. The Marxist government has been
backed by Cuban troops, which are now believed to number about
50,000.
   South Africa escalated its role in the war a year ago, moving
troops into southern Angola on a long-term basis. At least 45 South
African soldiers have since been killed.
   In recent months, Cuban troops for the first time moved en masse
from the northern half of Angola into the south, in some cases
deploying close to the Namibian border. Some military analysts said
the advance coincided with a shift in the balance of air power,
with the Cuban-Angolan air force overcoming technical flaws and
threatening South African supremacy.
   One question arising from the peace talks remains the role of
UNITA. Neither South Africa nor the United States has indicated it
is prepared to abandon the rebels. But the Angolan government
insists it will not negotiate any power-sharing arrangement with
UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi.
   The civil war has devastated Angola economically, killed tens of
thousands of people and left thousands more crippled by land mines,
bombardments and ambushes.
   South Africa, far wealthier and less affected by the combat, has
spent $2 billion a year on the war, according to one expert's
estimate.
   NAMIBIA:
   Made a German protectorate in 1884, Namibia was surrendered to
South Africa in 1915 and administered by that country under a
mandate of the League of Nations, a precursor to the United
Nations. Since 1978, South Africa has defied U.N. resolutions
calling for Namibia's independence.
   South Africa's has said it would grant Namibia independence only
after Cuban troops leave Angola. It says the Cuban military
presence might intimidate Namibians into supporting the South-West
African People's Organization, the guerrilla movement that took up
arms 22 years ago.
   SWAPO says it has the support of most Namibians and feels
certain of winning the national election envisioned under the U.N.
resolution.
   Blacks make up about 88 percent of Namibia's 1.3 million people
and South Africa has thus far preserved special privileges for the
whites and people of mixed race. There have been predictions that
many of the 70,000 whites would leave if independence under a
SWAPO-led government became imminent.

   Seven men indicted on charges they violated federal
neutrality laws by helping the Nicaraguan Contras say the Reagan
administration betrayed their patriotic fervor and abandoned them
as scapegoats.
   ``They used them and then abused them,'' Doug Jones, attorney
for Thomas Posey, said of the administration. ``You will never hear
one iota of evidence that anyone asked them to stop.''
   The federal indictment unsealed Wednesday named seven men,
including the brother of Contra leader Adolfo Calero, but no U.S.
administration officials or top Contra figures as some had
expected, even though the early stages of the probe helped uncover
the Iran-Contra military supply network.
   ``The indictment speaks for itself,'' said John Mattes, a
federal public defender whose investigation of a client's case led
to accusations that federal prosecutors tried to sidetrack the
probe. ``No one of substance was indicted.''
   The indictment covers a period in 1984 and 1985, and accuses the
seven of violating the U.S. Neutrality Act, which prohibits
mounting operations against foreign governments from U.S. soil.
   It accuses the men of sending mercenaries into combat in
Nicaragua, including a group that tried unsuccessfully to blow up a
bridge in 1985, but was forced out of the country, said Assistant
U.S. Attorney Mark Schnapp.
   As interim U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen detailed the indictment
in Miami, many outside the magistrate's courtroom in Fort
Lauderdale where the defendants were arraigned said they felt like
minor players in a covert Reagan administration policy gone sour.
   ``Where are the policy makers that put together this network?''
Mattes said. ``Why did they indict only the whistleblowers?''
   Jeffrey Feldman, the assistant U.S. attorney who prepared the
case, declined to talk about it because of ``a fundamental
obligation to assure that the defendants get a fair trial.''
   Of the six defendants who appeared in court Wednesday, four
pleaded innocent; two entered no plea because they did not have
permanent counsel.
    Mattes and Daniel Sheehan, attorney for the liberal Christic
Institute, suggested the indictment's main aim was to ``silence
Jack Terrell,'' once a mercenary member of the Contra aid network
who later cooperated with FBI investigators and became an outspoken
critic of Reagan policy in Nicaragua.
   On Wednesday, Terrell was bitter about facing the most serious
charges despite his cooperation.
   ``This is the reward you get for bucking administration
policy,'' he said. ``It doesn't pay to be a whistleblower in the
United States.''
   Congress at one point investigated the federal indictment on
charges that then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III tried to
sidetrack the probe.
   ``I have satisfied myself ... that there were no contacts made
with this office that attempted to influence the investigation,''
Lehtinen said.
   When reporters asked Lehtinen about claims by some defendants
that former National Security Council aide Oliver North and Robert
Owen approved their operations, Lehtinen referred all questions to
the Iran-Contra independent counsel.
   The special prosecutor's office cannot comment on current
investigations, said Washington spokesman Jim Wiethart.
   Calero's brother, Mario Calero of New Orleans, who has been
active in supplying the Contras, is accused of helping to equip the
mercenaries to battle the Sandinistas in Nicaragua.
   ``I shall wear this as one more badge to show that I am proud to
be a Contra,'' Mario Calero, who is Nicaraguan, said of the
indictment. ``I am a Contra. I have a God-given right to fight for
my country. How could I have violated the Neutrality Act?''
   Others indicted were Jose Coutin, a Miami Cuban and former
Civilian Material Assistance liaison here; Alex Martinez, a
conservative Cuban-American stockbroker; Joe Adams, a former
bodyguard to Adolfo Calero; and Maco Stewart, a wealthy former
assistant state attorney general and a 1960-1963 state
representative in Texas.
   Stewart, who lives in France, was ordered released on a $5
million personal bond and allowed to travel back to Europe. The
rest received $25,000 bonds except for Adams, who was to turn
himself in later.

   A pair of labor disputes threaten to force
Democratic National Convention delegates, one quarter of whom
belong to labor unions, to avoid certain parties and to cross
picket lines unless they want to walk to the convention.
   The Democrats, who count heavily on labor support, are hoping
the disputes can be resolved, or at least neutralized. One union
local says its parent union is pressuring it not to set up picket
lines.
   Intricate transportation plans could be snarled if transit
workers carry out threats to picket bus pickup points at hotels and
downtown rail stations beginning Monday, the first day of the
convention.
   In addition, social events for some of the party's elite, plus a
live broadcast of ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' on Friday could
be disrupted by a campaign seeking to organize the city's janitors.
   The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority is providing
106 of the 185 or so shuttle buses being used to ferry delegates
and workers from Atlanta's hotels to the convention site.
   Although management and party officials question whether the
transit union can picket legally because it is forbidden by state
law from striking, they admit privately that hard-core union
members coming to the convention would be unlikely to stand on
technicalities.
   Ralph Green, vice president of Local 732 of the Amalgamated
Transit Union, said Wednesday international president Jim LaSala
``has called me and asked me to retract our position and he asked
me to call together the executive committee Friday and he's going
to appeal to them to change their position.''
   Transit workers have been working without a contract since Oct.
19.
   Ruth Berry, spokewoman for the Democratic National Committee,
said Wednesday the party did not have enough information to advise
delegates how to respond to the threatened pickets.
   Meanwhile, Justice for Janitors, an organizing effort by the
Service Employees International Union, threatens to embarrass city
leaders who have struggled to portray Atlanta as the progressive
capital of the New South.
   The union has targeted noted Atlanta developer-architect John
Portman, and his home base of Peachtree Center, even though Portman
does not directly employ janitors but uses janitorial service
companies.
   Peachtree Center is a complex of office buildings in the center
of downtown, including the site of several high-profile social
events during the convention.
   Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson and Coretta
Scott King, widow of the slain civil rights leader Martin Luther
King Jr., have written letters supporting the union and Mayor
Andrew Young has attempted to mediate the dispute.
   In a letter sent to delegates this week, Portman said he is
neutral in the organizing battle. But union officials say his
companies have harassed janitors and discouraged efforts to
organize janitorial service companies.
   Although neither Portman nor his companies hire janitors
directly, ``he's the person that we have to deal with because he
controls the money,'' said union spokeswoman Barbara Webber.
   Portman also has ownership interest in several of the city's
largest hotels, including the Marriott Marquis, one of two
headquarters hotels and the location of Friday's scheduled live
broadcast of ``Good Morning America.''
   ``Since `Good Morning America' is set for a live broadcast, we
think we can do something there to attract attention,'' said Robert
Sarason, regional coordinator for the janitors' union.
   The union also plans pickets or other demonstrations at a brunch
for Congress members Sunday given by USA Today and it parent
company, Gannett, at The Atlanta Apparel Mart, a private dinner
that night at Portman's home for Democratic National Committee
trustees and a reception for delegates at the Marquis on Wednesday
given by Delta Air Lines.
   The union says it will not seek to disrupt two events hosted by
Young, even though they take place at Portman-owned buildings.

<HEAD>`Dutch' Reagan Returning To WOC Microphone</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Reagan scheduled to visit station at 2:25 p.m. EDT.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GREG SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Ronald Reagan seems to be the same
handsome, good-natured fellow he was in 1932, when he started out
as a $5-a-week sports announcer at WOC radio, a former co-worker
said on the eve of the president's return visit.
   ``I don't think success has changed him a lot,'' Lucile Mauget
said Wednesday. ``He always had a joke and a smile.''
   Fifty-six years ago, Reagan borrowed his father's Oldsmobile and
set out from the family home in Dixon, Ill., in search of a job in
radio. He found one, and today he's returning on Air Force One.
   Reagan planned to attend the dedication of WOC's new building _
about three miles from where he started work broadcasting football
games _ deliver a speech and reminisce on WOC about his radio days.
The visit to this eastern Iowa city was to be part of his tour of
the drought-ravaged Midwest.
   ``For someone who covers the White House every day, this is
probably pretty ho-hum. But for us, it's very exciting,'' said WOC
News Director Mark Minnick, who was to spend 10 minutes chatting on
the air with Reagan.
   ``I'm excited and nervous,'' Minnick said. ``I hope and pray I
don't stumble all over my tongue. He'll probably be less nervous
than I am.''
   When Reagan was at WOC more than half a century ago, Ms. Mauget
worked in the business department and wrote paychecks for the
station's 15-20 employees, including the man known to listeners as
``Dutch.''
   Reagan went on to become a movie star, governor of California
and president of the United States. Ms. Mauget worked off and on at
WOC for 35 years.
   When she retired three years ago, Reagan remembered her.
   ``I got a very nice letter from him mentioning that those were
happy times he spent here,'' she said.
   Reagan, whose hometown of Dixon, Ill., was a 75-mile drive away,
started at WOC shortly after graduating from Eureka College in
Illinois in 1932. His audition for a sports announcer's job at the
AM station was to recreate an imaginary football game for 15
minutes.
   He got the job.
   After his first re-creation of a real football game _ Reagan
would take a teletype description of the game and broadcast it live
_ his salary was doubled, and he was put on for the rest of the
football season.
   When a staff opening came up, he was hired full-time at $25 a
week, a good salary during the Great Depression.
   ``At $100 a month, I'd never been richer,'' Reagan wrote in a
1965 autobiography.
   Reagan went to work on Feb. 10, 1933, and left for a job at
WOC's sister station, WHO in Des Moines, before the middle of May
that year, according to historian Garry Wills' book, ``Reagan's
America.''
   Ms. Mauget said she had thought Reagan might go on to a network
sports announcing job, but did not consider he might someday be
president.
   ``I don't think when we were young we thought that far into the
future,'' Ms. Mauget said. ``I just knew he was serious about doing
something.''
   In the 1920s, when Reagan was growing up, the station used to
sign off nightly with the message, ``This is Station WOC ...
Davenport, Iowa, where the West begins and in the state where the
tall corn grows.''

<HEAD>Man Given Probation for Trying to Sell Daughter</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man who tried to sell his daughter to
her uncle for $100,000 was sentenced to three years probation and
312 hours of community service in a plea bargain.
   Joseph Waltman, who had pleaded guilty to endangering the
welfare of a child in the plea agreement, was given probation
Wednesday because it was his first offense, said Bergen County
Superior Court Judge James Madden. He could have received a
five-year prison term.
   ``I am not condoning what this young man did,'' Madden said.
``However, there are mitigating circumstances ... extreme
mitigating circumstances.''
   Waltman, 24, of Alloway Township was arrested outside Giants
Stadium in East Rutherford in March 1987, when he attempted to sell
daughter Rachel, now 6 years old, to her uncle, Gary Stern. Police,
tipped off by Stern, were waiting for Waltman in the New York City
suburb.
   Waltman's attorney, James Patuto, said his client was a victim
of pressures brought on him in a battle over Rachel's custody with
other family members.
   The sentence was criticized by Stern and his wife, Deborah, of
Sunrise, Fla., who adopted the child in May after a custody battle.
   ``It's a very dark day,'' Gary Stern said. ``You have to pray
that if you can hold out long enough justice will prevail. Today,
it didn't.''
   The custody fight involving the Sterns, Rachel's maternal
grandparents and her former stepmother followed Waltman's arrest.
   A New Jersey judge awarded full custody to the Sterns last
December, but gave the grandparents and the former stepmother
visitation rights.
   The Sterns complied with the order, sending Rachel to New Jersey
twice for visits with her relatives.
   But after a Florida judge approved the adoption in May, Gary
Stern cut off visitation, claiming Rachel was now his daughter and
that it was inappropriate for a child so young to be traveling back
and forth.
   Stern's attorney, Harry Gulkin, said a child psychologist found
that the visitation was causing Rachel to become confused about her
identity and her family.
   Last month, a Bridgeton judge found the Sterns in contempt of
court for adopting Rachel in Florida and interrupting the visits.
   Rachel, who enters first grade this fall, has been bounced from
one family to another since her teen-age mother died after a truck
slammed into her car in October 1984.
   She was awarded $2.9 million last year in a personal injury
lawsuit against the company that owned the truck. The payments do
not begin until she turns 18.

<TEXT>
   New York City Opera director Beverly Sills has
agreed to produce a TV pilot for her own daily, one-hour variety
program that would go on the air in September 1989.
   Miss Sills, who announced in May her plans to retire as general
director of the once-struggling opera company on Jan. 1, said at
the time that she was considering accepting a TV talk-show offer.
   ``At this point in my career, I am only willing to do things
that I can have fun with,'' said Miss Sills, 59, on Wednesday.
``This sounds like a lot of fun.''
   The Brooklyn-born coloratura soprano joined the company in 1955
and was its biggest star until 1980, when she retired from singing.
   Plans for the television show call for it to be taped before an
audience in New York. The format will include a band with
entertainers and other celebrities joining Miss Sills, who will
have a different co-host each week.
   Miss Sills agreed to the pilot program this week with G.T.G.
East, part of a joint venture between Grant Tinker and the Gannett
Co. G.T.G. East plans to assemble the pilot this summer and begin
selling the show to local stations this fall.

<TEXT>
   Liberian President Samuel K. Doe said
Wednesday that his security forces quashed a coup attempt led by
his former second-in-command, church-owned Radio Elwa reported.
   In a nationwide broadcast Wednesday night, Doe said his forces
exchanged gunfire ``with what is believed to have been an invading
force'' at one of Liberia's border posts in northern Nimba county,
the radio staton said.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nairobi, quoted Doe as saying the
alleged force was led by J. Nicholas Podier Jr., described as vice
head-of-state of the former ruling People's Redemption Council.
   Doe was quoted as saying the attackers suffered some casualties,
but he did not specify how many or whether Podier was among them.
   Podier was one of 17 enlisted men and non-commissioned officers
led by then-Master Sgt. Doe who seized control of the West African
nation in an April 12, 1980 coup. They stormed the executive
mansion in Monrovia and assassinated President William R. Tolbert.
   After the coup, Doe and his confederates set up the People's
Redemption Council, which ruled by decree until 1985 elections
returned Liberia to civilian rule with Doe as president.
   Podier fell from power in 1982 after being accused of plotting
against Doe.
   Radio Elwa quoted Doe, 36, as saying 12 people were involved in
the alleged invasion, but did not specify where in Nimba County,
350 miles north of the capital Monrovia, the incident occurred.
Nimba County shares borders with Guinea to the west and the Ivory
Coast to the east.
   The president assured ``all Liberians and foreigners alike''
that his government was in ``complete control of the situation and
there is no need to panic,'' the radio said.
   On March 22, police arrested 12 people connected with an alleged
plot to assassinate Doe and overthrow his government.

   Stunned worshippers gathered for Bible
study without their church's pastor, who was in jail today accused
of killing his live-in girlfriend and burying her hours before
giving his Sunday sermon.
   ``Everybody's just knocked out and surprised,'' said Hezekiah
Butler, chairman of the board of deacons for Zion Traveler
Missionary Baptist Church, one of three churches served by the Rev.
Jonathan Hamlin.
   ``He's been a wonderful pastor and a wonderful young man. You've
never run across a finer person in the world,'' Butler said.
   Hamlin, 24, was arrested Monday by the Warren County Sheriff's
Department, accused of fatally shooting 24-year-old Lula Sims. Held
on $100,000 bond, he won't be required to enter a plea until a
grand jury issues an indictment.
   Authorities say Hamlin shot Sims in the head and chest on July
3, buried her body in woods about 40 miles southeast of Vicksburg,
and hours later preached during Sunday morning worship at Zion
Traveler.
   Sims remained buried for eight days, until Dorothy Lipscomb
persuaded Sheriff Paul Barrett to investigate her daughter's
disappearance.
   Barrett said he questioned Hamlin, a father of three, who
admitted that he had killed Sims and led officers to her shallow
grave Monday night. Police recovered the pearl-handled, .22-caliber
pistol they believe Hamlin used.
   Hamlin's estranged wife had given him the gun as a gift, Barrett
said.
   The sheriff did not provide further details of Hamlin's
admission.
   On Wednesday night, members of the congregation gathered for
Bible study at the small red brick building that houses the church.
Outside, a sign read: ``Rev. J. Hamlin, pastor.''
   ``He was just a first-class minister,'' said Daniel Clark, a
long-time member of Zion Traveler. ``That's the way it seemed to
us.''
   Hamlin, a member of Zion Traveler, was elected to lead the
500-member congregation in November after the church's longtime
pastor died, Butler said.
   The church grew under Hamlin to the point where all the
worshippers couldn't enter the sanctuary on the one Sunday each
month that the church held services, Butler said.
   Church members purchased three adjacent houses and other pieces
of property and were planning to enlarge their building.
   Sims' mother recalled a different side of Hamlin.
   ``About a month and a half ago he choked her,'' Lipscomb said
Wednesday in the living room of her small, neat Vicksburg home.
   Lipscomb said she had gone to the house Hamlin shared with her
daughter because the minister ``called me and said he was bleeding
to death.''
   After she and her husband, Carl, arrived, Lipscomb said, her
daughter ripped open the T-shirt she was wearing.
   ``Her breasts were nothing but scars and she had scars around
her neck where he had choked her.'' She said Hamlin, who had told
her daughter he was separated and getting divorced, had a small cut
on the head.
   Lipscomb said, however, that her daughter never complained to
her that Hamlin was violent. ``She was the type of person, she
would keep her problems to herself.''
   Vicksburg, a town of 35,000 along the Mississippi River, is
``stirred up about Rev. Hamlin,'' Butler said.
   ``They just don't see, as fine a man as he was, how in the world
something like that could happen.''

   A baby trapped in a car safety seat
burned to death when her parents' car burst into flames in the
parking lot of a doctor's office, officials said.
   Najia Nawabi, 16 months, was pronounced dead at the scene of
Wednesday's blaze.
   Two other Nawabi children, 4 and 2{, escaped injury. They
watched in horror as their younger sister perished while two
bystanders tried to rescue her.
   ``I pulled and jerked on that baby seat but it wouldn't budge,''
said Gary Smith of San Leandro. ``The flames completely engulfed
the car. All I wanted was to get the baby out of there.''
   Smith and another bystander, Dr. Mosa Mardanzai, attempted to
unfasten the baby seat, but had to give up when smoke and flames
encircled the screaming infant.
   ``I couldn't see her anymore,'' said a shaken Mardanzai, 47.
   Sheriff's officials said Noorn and Noor Nawabi of Hayward parked
their car in front of the medical center where Noor Nawabi, who is
six months pregnant, had an appointment with her physician.
   Noorn Nawabi stayed in the car with the toddler and the couple's
two sons. At one point, he told authorities, he left the children
alone to check on his wife and the fire broke out while he was gone.
   The cause of the fire was under investigation, said Castro
Valley Fire Marshal Robert Bohman.

<TEXT>
   Artful diplomacy may well resolve a
current impasse over strategic U.S. military bases in the
Philippines, but the issue is likely to haunt the
allies-turned-wary partners' relations for some time.
   The stumbling block now is money: Should the U.S. boost the
compensation it currently pays Manila to maintain its massive naval
and air installations in this Southeast Asian nation?
   Washington says the current $180 million a year is probably
enough. Manila wants much more.
   But the underlying problems are far more complex than cash. They
include growing Filipino nationalism and American global interests,
local politicking here and nearly a century of intimate but not
always happy relations.
   Recent polls indicate that if a general vote were taken now, the
bases would stay beyond the 1991 expiration of a 41-year-old treaty
under which they were established. Many Filipinos, perhaps most,
still appear to harbor pro-American feelings.
   During this week's visit to Manila by Secretary of State George
P. Shultz, the lines of Filipinos outside the U.S. Embassy seeking
visas far outnumbered nearby anti-American demonstrators wielding
placards reading, ``Go to hell, not here.''
   But the onerous legacy of deposed President Ferdinand E. Marcos
and the still rocky democracy under President Corazon Aquino have
created many problems related to the bases that have yet to be
thrashed out.
   Mrs. Aquino was swept into power in February 1986 in a
civilian-military uprising that sent Marcos into exile in Hawaii.
   The uncertainties include a potent communist insurgency and a
volatile political arena that has included the spectacle of several
failed coup attempts by military factions.
   Beyond the island nation, there are questions of whether the
Soviet Union and China will continue beefing up their military
forces in the region and how much pressure non-communist Southeast
Asian neighbors will exert on the Philippines to keep the U.S.
military presence.
   Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, a partner of the
Philippines in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, has said
the bases are ``crucial for a balance of forces in the Western
Pacific.''
   Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base are the largest U.S.
military installations outside the United States. Subic is
especially crucial because it serves as the major repair and supply
facility for U.S. forces in the Pacific and Indian Oceans as well
as the Persian Gulf.
   Mrs. Aquino herself is a question mark, having maintained a
steadfast silence over whether she wants the bases to remain. ``I
am keeping my options open,'' she keeps saying.
   Staying or not staying also depends on how both sides muster
their propaganda and play their diplomatic cards.
   The protracted and still ongoing review of the agreement,
something called for every five years, is probably a foretaste of
things to come through 1991.
   In negotiations beginning in April, the Philippine side asked
for significantly more compensation; some suggested $1.2 billion
and more. There was talk of terminating the agreement.
   Shultz called the sums ``staggering'' and said the U.S. might
have to move the bases elsewhere. Haggling continued.
   During Shultz's visit, both sides said they hoped the review
could be completed by the end of this month. A compromise appeared
to be in the making.
   But still pending is the issue of whether the Philippines will
pass into law a bill banning all nuclear weapons from the country,
something Washington strongly opposes.
   And if the review negotiations and outcome leave too sour a
taste in American mouths, Washington might be reluctant to provide
large sums for a major, multilateral plan to rehabilitate the
tottering Philippine economy.
   Meanwhile, anti-American protests have become a feature of
Manila life, and the rhetoric as well as legitimate debate have
heated up. The bases issue has sparked political posturing and
deeply rooted feelings about the United States and the country's
own past.
   ``It's time the Americans should know we are not happy being
treated as a charity case. And it's time, too, we Filipinos
shouldn't act@react as if our survival would forever be dependent
on the mercy and benevolence of Ole Uncle Sam,'' said a recent
editorial in Manila's ``Business World.''
   Base opponents like to recall days when the country was under
U.S. colonial rule and more recent times when President Reagan
called Marcos ``a force of reason and moderation in Asia'' and Vice
President George Bush praised him for his ``adherence to democratic
principles.''
   The United States prefers to remember Americans and Filipinos
fighting and dying side-by-side in World War II and shared cultural
and political values. American diplomats work overtime trying to
counter the rather loud anti-base voices.
   But one U.S. Embassy official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the time when U.S. envoys spoke and Filipino
officials fell into line are over.
   ``It's real diplomacy in the trenches,'' he said.

<HEAD>Lightning-sparked Fires Char Thousands of Acres in West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Firefighters today battled lightning-sparked fires that raced
across thousands of acres of dry brush and timber in several
Western states, including Montana's Custer National Forest where 44
fires consumed nearly 4,000 acres.
   In Wyoming, a fire burning in the Bridger-Teton National
Forest's Teton Wilderness bounded across meadows and pockets of
dense trees on Wednesday, spreading from an estimated 100 acres to
about 1,000 acres.
   The blaze threatened a 15,000-acre area of fallen trees
representing about 100 million board feet of lumber, forest
spokesman Fred Kingwill said, adding that authorities were not
fighting the fire yet.
   ``It's continuing in a natural way, as it would have several
hundred years ago before man got here,'' Kingwill said.
   Steady winds of up to 15 mph fanned the flames, pushing the fire
northeast into pockets of lodgepole pine, spruce and fir trees, he
said.
   To the east, 20 Forest Service firefighters battled a 400-acre
blaze in the Thunder Basin National Grasslands, where erratic wind
combined with hot weather to push the flames across a containment
line and into ponderosa pine trees, grass and sagebrush.
   In southeastern Montana, 44 fires started by lightning Monday
had burned about 3,900 acres in drought-stricken Custer National
Forest's Ashland Ranger District.
   While the temperature soared near 100 degrees Wednesday,
hundreds of firefighters built containment lines while bombers and
helicopters dropped retardant on the flames.
   A fire about 15 miles northeast of Ashland, Mont., quadrupled in
size Wednesday afternoon, growing from 200 to 800 acres, said Rob
McWhorter of the Bureau of Land Management.
   About 20 miles southeast of Ashland, another fire covered 2,500
acres with two 40-person crews on the line, along with five fire
engines and two bulldozers, McWhorter said, adding that the blaze
was burning out of control.
   In southeastern Idaho's Caribou National Forest, firefighters
had the 2,300-acre Devil's Creek fire mostly contained, but high
wind, low humidity and dry timber hampered their efforts, said
Forest Service spokesman Frank Carroll.
   Several hundred acres of drought-parched fallow cropland had
been threatened by the fire earlier, but only federal range and
some private grazing land have been charred by the flames.
   ``The fuels are critically, extremely dry. We have 8 percent
humidity and 95 degree temperatures. Like Phoenix, Ariz. on a hot
day,'' Carroll said.
   Near Delta, Utah, firefighters from Utah and Nevada made
progress on three lightning-sparked fires that burned nearly 1,600
acres of high mountain brush and timber.
   A 400-acre blaze in North Canyon about 60 miles west of Delta
and a 900-acre fire at the Sage Valley Pass 11 miles southwest of
Nephi, Utah, were both contained Wednesday, said Bureau of Land
Management dispatcher Mike Nielsen in Richfield.

<HEAD>Analysts: Tobacco Stocks Rise On Word Of Plaintiff's Attorney</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney Marc Z. Edell is used to having
jurors listen to him. But the reaction of the stock market caught
him off guard when his comments about cigarette-health litigation
sent tobacco stocks sharply higher.
   ``It's nice to be so important that people listen to what I
say,'' said Edell, who represented the widower of a lung-cancer
victim in a landmark lawsuit that led to the first damage award
against a cigarette-maker for a smoker's death.
   Analysts Wednesday said Edell's prediction to a group of
investors that liability cases would not seriously damage the
financial health of cigarette makers prompted a buying spree for
tobacco stocks.
   In the most dramatic example, Philip Morris Cos. Inc. jumped $6
between July 6, the day before the luncheon investment meeting, and
Wednesday, when the stock closed at $89.87{.
   RJR-Nabisco's stock rose $4.12{ to $51.87{ during the period;
Loews Corp., owner of cigarette maker Lorillard Inc., rose 87{
cents to $67.50; American Brands rose 75 cents to $49.87{; and
Liggett Group Inc. rose 12{ cents to $8.
   All but Liggett had shown slight declines the day before the
meeting. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped from 2,130 to
2,104 between July 6 and Wednesday's close.
   Analysts attributed much of the rise to Edell's comments to
about 60 institutional investment clients of Sanford C. Bernstein &
Co. Inc. of New York.
   ``I don't think there's any other explanation for it,'' said
Bernstein tobacco analyst Marc Cohen.
   ``It was very clear that people walked out of that meeting
feeling very comfortable,'' he said, adding that tobacco stocks
began an upward move that afternoon.
   In a telephone interview, Edell said he told the investors
nothing other than what he has said before and after the widely
reported verdict in federal court in Newark on June 13, that he did
not think cigarette liability cases ``are going to have a serious
financial impact on these companies.''
   The jury ordered Liggett Group Inc. to pay $400,000 in damages
to Antonio Cipollone for the death of his wife, Rose, who died of
lung cancer after 40 years of smoking.
   Many analysts have discounted fears that the Cipollone decision
would unleash a wave of liability cases against cigarette makers.
They noted that the jury exonerated Liggett, Philip Morris and
Lorillard of conspiring to defraud the public about the dangers of
smoking.
   Despite those views, many investment managers have taken a
``wait and see attitude'' toward tobacco stocks since the verdict,
Cohen said. But Edell's statement appears to have eased any
lingering investor fears about the stocks, he added.
   Also encouraging investors' enthusiasm was an indication from
Philip Morris and RJR that their second-quarter earnings, due to be
announced next week, would be about 30 percent higher than last
year, said Merrill Lynch analyst Allan Kaplan.
   Edell said Wednesday his firm has received more than a hundred
calls nationwide asking him to take smoker-death cases but that he
and his partners have not decided yet whether to accept any of them.
   Cohen said Edell told the investor group that he now could fight
a liability case at a cost of $200,000 following the work done on
the Cipollone case. The lawyer has said that the 4{-year Cipollone
case cost $2 million.

<HEAD>California Boy, 11, Becomes Youngest Pilot To Cross Atlantic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LE BOURGET, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old California boy today
became the youngest pilot to cross the Atlantic, landing at the
Paris airport where Charles Lindbergh completed a historic solo
crossing in 1927.
   Christopher Lee Marshall touched down his single-engine plane at
Le Bourget airport on a flight from Glasgow, Scotland, where he
spent the night.
   The boy aviator was greeted by his mother as he stepped from the
plane wearing a bright blue flight suit and a baseball cap with a
sign reading ``Chris Marshall Tour.''
   ``We're finally here. We made it,'' he said, grinning ear-to-ear
but looking tired.
   ``Mommy missed you so much. Give me a kiss,'' said his mother,
Gail Marshall, who waved an American flag and clutched a stuffed
bear intended as a present for her son.
   The young aviator from Oceano, Calif., then kissed his mother.
   Christopher started his flight in San Diego on July 7. He was
accompanied by retired Navy pilot Randy Cunningham, 46, who limited
Marshall's flying time to eight-hour stretches.
   A champagne and cola reception was held in the hangar of the
airport, north of Paris.
   Despite the trans-Atlantic venture, which included stops in St.
Louis, New York, Montreal, Greenland, Iceland and Scotland,
Christopher revealed his youth.
   On stepping from the plane, his first words to his mother were:
``I have to go to the toilet.'' He disappeared briefly then
returned to pose for photographers.
   At one point, Christopher re-entered the aircraft to produce his
old stuffed bear, from which he has said he is inseparable.
Photographers snapped pictures of Christopher with the cuddly
animal in its goggles and helmet and bearing a sign with its name
``Charles Lindbeargh.''
   Christopher arrived in Glasgow Wednesday night after an 840-mile
flight from Reykjavik, Iceland in his single-engine Mooney 252
aircraft.
   He arrived in Reykjavik early Wednesday after flying about 450
miles from Kulusuk on Greenland's southeast coast in 2 hours 15
minutes.
   The arrival in Paris was delayed by one day due to engine
troubles Wednesday that forced the plane back to Greenland.
   Cunningham said he took over the controls to fly the plane 50
miles back to Greenland after engine trouble and bad weather with
low visibility made the situation critical.
   He said it was the only time during the flight that he took
control of the aircraft.
   Cunningham said he had trouble finding the air field at Kukusuk,
an island of Greenland's southeast coast: ``We would have had to
ditch at sea. I didn't think I was going to live.''
   The oil filter cap had rattled loose so the oil pressure
plummeted and the engine overheated.
   Christopher's mother said her son began flying with his father
at the age of 4 and began training with an instructor at age 7.
   She said she was worried by the problems Wednesday.
   ``If I knew, I don't think I would have let him go,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   CBS' announcement that it would bring in an ABC
news executive as president of CBS News marked the end of an era
for CBS, and the acknowledgement of a new period of respectability
for ABC.
   ABC News Vice President David Burke will become president of CBS
News on Aug. 1, the first outsider to ever hold the job. He
replaces Howard Stringer, who was promoted to president of the CBS
Broadcast Group, the financial heart of the network.
   Burke arrived at ABC 11 years ago when Roone Arledge took over
the division. At the time, it would have been unthinkable that
big-shot CBS, the home of the late broadcasting great Edward R.
Murrow, would look to third-place ABC for leadership.
   That's one reason Burke's boss at ABC didn't exactly sound
distraught when he commented on Burke's new job.
   ``He richly deserves this recognition, which is a compliment
both to him and to ABC News. ... We all wish him the absolute
best,'' Arledge said.
   Stringer replaces Gene Jankowski, who becomes chairman of the
Broadcast Group.
   William S. Paley, chairman of the CBS board of directors, and
Laurence A. Tisch, the company's president and chief executive
officer, announced the changes in a statement Wednesday.
   The changes follow a dismal prime-time season that dropped CBS
into an embarrassing third in the ratings for the first time in its
history.
   Despite that, CBS also reported Wednesday that its
second-quarter profit climbed 40 percent to a record high. The
company cited higher interest income, improved operating efficiency
and an increase in broadcast sales in spite of a sluggish
advertising market.
   But Tisch warned at a news conference that the business outlook
for broadcasting this year ``is somewhat uncertain'' because the
19-week strike by the Writers Guild of America threatens to delay
the start of the fall TV season.
   The CBS news division has fairly flourished under the
controversial and highly criticized layoffs and budget cuts that
Tisch imposed during Stringer's tenure as president.
   Despite the cutbacks, the division reclaimed the morning show
time period from the entertainment division, launched a new
prime-time news show, ``48 Hours,'' and brought the ``CBS Evening
News'' back to No. 1 in recent weeks after trailing NBC last summer
and trailing ABC during the second quarter of this year.
   And CBS News has three hours of prime-time news on the fall
schedule _ albeit partly because of the writers' strike creating
the need for programming. News show writers are not covered by the
guild. ABC has one prime-time news hour, NBC none.
   Stringer, a former executive producer of the ``CBS Evening
News,'' has been with CBS for 23 years, the last two as president
of CBS News. Jankowski has served 11 years as president of the CBS
Broadcast Group.
   Jankowski moved up through the CBS sales division to become head
of the Broadcast Group. During his tenure, CBS' prime-time schedule
fell victim to NBC's rise. Last season, Kim LeMasters replaced CBS
Entertainment President Bud Grant and will be tested when his first
full-season schedule gets on the air in 1988-89.
   Tisch said Jankowski had told him that with the completion of
this year's program development cycle, it was ``an appropriate time
for an orderly transition in the management of the broadcast
group.''
   Burke, a one-time political staffer who worked for U.S. Sen.
Edward Kennedy, joined ABC 11 years ago as a business and policy
adviser to Arledge. Stringer said Burke has established ``a
remarkable record as a news executive through program innovation
and management strength.''

   A former top Justice Department official denies
smoking marijuana while U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, and says
he was warned the allegation might come up at a hearing into
Attorney General Edwin Meese's conduct.
   ``I would have to be pretty dumb to smoke marijuana while a
sitting U.S. attorney,'' William Weld, the former head of the
Justice Department's criminal division, said in a telephone
interview Wednesday.
   Weld, who reportedly quit his Justice Department job because he
thought there was enough evidence to seek a criminal indictment
against Meese, told the Senate Judiciary Committee in a letter
Tuesday that the marijuana allegation was unfounded.
   Weld also told the panel that he would testify about why he
resigned. Meese, under fire from Congress because of questions
raised about his ethics, announced last week that he would leave
the administration by next month after an independent prosecutor
declined to bring charges against him.
   Weld said Duke Short, the Judiciary Committee's top Republican
aide, told him the committee had been informed of the allegation
and questioned whether it might ``complicate'' his testimony about
Meese, set for July 26.
   Weld confirmed Wednesday's story in the Washington Times that
the department's Office of Professional Responsibility last year
investigated an allegation he smoked marijuana while attending a
wedding in Virginia in 1982. At the time, he was Massachusetts' top
federal prosecutor.
   The investigation found no basis for the allegation, which was
raised in an anonymous letter to the department last July,
according to The Boston Globe.
   However, the Times quoted sources as saying that Frank McNamara,
the current U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, saw Weld smoking
marijuana at the wedding.
   ``I'm not going tell you it's not true,'' the newspaper quoted
McNamara as saying.
   ``I don't know why Frank would say that,'' Weld said. ``It's
absurd.''
   Attempts to reach McNamara for comment Wednesday were
unsuccessful. A receptionist said McNamara was in Washington but
could not say where. A message left on his home answering machine
was not returned.

   A Harrier fighter jet crashed soon after
takeoff on a training mission, killing the Marine pilot, officials
said.
   It was the second fatal crash involving a Harrier based at
Cherry Point Marine Air Station this year.
   The $30 million AV8-B Harrier II went down near Havelock just
after 8 a.m. Wednesday, about a mile south of the air station
runway into the backyard of a mobile home, said Master Sgt. Sandra
Riley, a Marine spokeswoman.
   The jet clipped a stand of trees before it hit the ground and
burned in a rural area off Highway 101, Ms. Riley said.
   The pilot was 1st Lt. Kerry D. Dale, 26, of Havelock, a member
of the Marine Attack Training Squadron 203 and part of the Second
Marine Aircraft Wing. Ms. Riley said Dale had been on a routine
training mission.
   The Harrier is capable of vertical takeoffs and landings but was
not attempting a vertical takeoff when it crashed, Ms. Riley said.
Riley said.
   A team from the air station is investigating the cause of the
crash, Ms. Riley said.

<HEAD>Court Hears Accused Hijacker Was Sought On Murder Charges In

<TEXT>
   Mohammed Ali Hamadi, on trial for
murder and air piracy in the 1985 TWA hijacking, was being sought
on murder charges in his native Lebanon in 1983, according to
evidence introduced today.
   Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger read a document from
authorities in Lebanon that said an arrest warrant was issued for
the defendant in 1983 on charges of murder and unlawful use of
weapons.
   The document did not contain details of the alleged crimes, and
Hamadi said, ``I don't know anything about it.''
   The TWA jetliner, on an Athens-to-Rome flight, was hijacked in
June 1985. U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem of Waldorf, Md., was
killed after the hijackers forced the plane to land in Beirut.
   Thirty-nine Americans were held hostage during the 17-day ordeal.
   Hamadi, who came to West Germany in 1982, also testified today
that he worked at a cemetery in Saarlouis in 1983 while his
application for political asylum was pending.
   He said he tried to commit suicide, once by swallowing pills in
1983 and once before by slashing his wrists, because he was
depressed about his life in West Germany and because of
developments in Lebanon.
   Hamadi has said he returned to Lebanon in 1984 in part because
his application for political asylum was not approved.
   A Shiite Moslem, Hamadi testified Wednesday that he belonged to
the Shiite Amal militia between 1980 and 1982 in Beirut and was
involved in battles there.
   But he denied involvement with Hezbollah, or Party of God, a
radical pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem group believed to be the umbrella
organization for gunmen holding foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   One of Hamadi's brothers, Abdul-Hadi Hamadi, is chief of
security for Hezbollah in Beirut. Another, Abbas Ali Hamadi, was
convicted in April of kidnapping two West Germans in Lebanon in an
attempt to win Mohammed's freedom. He was sentenced to 13 years in
prison by a Duesseldort court.
   Speaking in Arabic, Hamadi told the court today that while
living in Beirut he had been trained to fight as an Amal member.
   ``I was forced (by circumstances) to carry weapons. I wanted to
fight against Israel,'' Hamadi said, making his first statements to
the Frankfurt court since his trial began last week.
   ``There is a saying in our country: In Lebanon, you are born
with a weapon in your hand,'' he said.
   Hamadi said he was trained by Amal to use a rocket-propelled
grenade launcher and other weapons.
   Asked whether he had owned hand grenades, Hamadi answered:
``Everyone had these at home. You could buy them like you buy
eggs.''
   He told the court he had smuggled liquid explosives into West
Germany twice, contradicting a statement he made to police after
his January 1987 arrest. At the time, Hamadi told police he thought
the bottles were filled with alcohol and denied knowing that they
contained high explosives.
   ``A certain person asked me to smuggle them in and hide them,''
Hamadi said. ``I did it twice. The second time I was arrested. ...
I don't know the reason why the explosives were brought in. I was
not told.''
   Hamadi was accused of involvement in the hijacking based on
evidence that includes fingerprints. West Germany last year
rejected a U.S. request for his extradition.
   Hamadi is being tried under heavy security in a specially
constructed prison courtroom.

   The ruling Nationalist Party gave new
blood to its policy-making body today by replacing several aging
holdovers from the Chiang Kai-shek era with a more dynamic
leadership.
   President Lee Teng-hui, who last week became the first native
Taiwanese to lead the party, has indicated that the newly organized
Central Standing Committee will try to bring further democratic
change to this Asian economic powerhouse.
   Twelve of 31 members of the committee stepped down, including
five of seven octogenarians. The group's average age fell from 70
to 63. For the first time, a majority of the members are native
Taiwanese, who now hold 16 seats.
   ``In the past, many of the party elders were completely out of
touch with the society,'' said Lu Ya-li, political science
professor at National Taiwan University. ``The younger members may
not be all reform-minded, but they must be more sensitive to what
the society wants. They know that there must be a democratic
change.''
   The new policy-making group, whose decisions are implemented by
the Nationalist government, was proposed by Lee. Candidates were
approved by the 180-member Central Committee, which was elected at
the weeklong 13th party congress that concluded Wednesday.
   The Nationalists began exercising one-party rule on this island
in 1949, when Chiang Kai-shek led them in flight from mainland
China after losing a civil war to the Communists. By claiming to
still represent all China, the party remained dominated by
mainlanders.
   But as the island prospered, the native Taiwanese who make up
about 85 percent of the island's nearly 20 million people pressured
for democratic change, leading to the lifting of martial law and
the end of a ban on opposition parties under President Chiang
Ching-kuo, eldest son of Chiang Kai-shek.
   Still to be changed is the parliamentary system in which
mainland Chinese Nationalists hold a majority of seats as a symbol
of the party's claim to China.
   Lee Teng-hui, who became president when Chiang Ching-kuo died
last January, has vowed to continue with political, social and
economic liberalization, but the pace of change is likely to depend
largely on the new policy-making committee.
   ``The pace of reform may be quickened,'' said Lu.
   Key figures remaining on the committee include Chief of General
Staff Hau Pei-tsun, Party Secretary-General Lee Huan and Premier Yu
Kuo-hwa.
   Lee Huan is seen as a supporter of the liberalization process,
while Yu is viewed as the most powerful holdover from the
authoritarian past of the Nationalist Party, also known as
Kuomintang.
   Yu received less support than many younger, vocal supporters of
liberalization during the congress, fueling specuation about his
political future. A Cabinet reshuffle is expected soon.
   The new Central Standing Committee members include four Chinese
mainlanders age 64 or over, two of whom are linked to the military.
   Also added to the policy-making body were five Taiwanese _ a
union leader, an industrialist, a leading central banker and two
top politicians from the southern port of Kaohsiung.
   The remaining new members are Frederick Chien, 54, Taiwan's main
representative in Washington; Education Minister Mao Kao-wen; and
47-year-old James Soong, a party deputy secretary-general who is
the youngest committee member and seen as a rising star.

   A high-pressure system spread a steamy blanket over much of the
nation today, boosting temperatures in the southern and central
Plains and the middle Mississippi Valley.
   Temperatures were already in the 80s this morning, and highs
from the upper 90s to over 100 degrees were forecast for much of
America west of the Mississippi.
   The hot, humid weather was expected to linger through Friday
because of the high-pressure system extending across most of the
western and central sections of the nation.
   Cooler weather in the 50s and 60s prevailed only across the
northern tier. Showers and thunderstorms were scattered along a
cold front curving from upper Michigan into southern Nebraska.
   Strong thunderstorms swept through southern Wisconsin, extreme
northern Illinois and northwestern Missouri. A few showers and
thunderstorms also lingered in eastern Colorado and southwest
Kansas.
   Fair skies prevailed across the rest of the nation.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from Pennsylvania to New York and New England, from southeast
Virginia to North Carolina, northern South Carolina, the southern
Appalachian mountains and Florida.
   Temperatures were predicted in the 60s and 70s in the Pacific
Northwest and along the California coast; the 70s to near 80
degrees in Maine; the 80s from northern New England to the upper
Great Lakes and in northern Montana; from 100 to 105 degrees in
western Kansas, western Oklahoma and parts of the Texas Panhandle;
from 100 to 110 in the desert Southwest, Nevada and Utah; and in
the 90s in the rest of the country.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 49
degrees at Sexton Summit, Ore., to 93 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz.

   Four Navy swimming instructors punished
in the training death of a recruit have appealed the rank
reductions, pay forfeitures and other penalties imposed by their
commander, a Navy spokeswoman says.
   The punishments were for the March 2 death of Airman Recruit Lee
Mirecki, 19, of Appleton, Wis.
   Mirecki was described as being literally scared to death when he
was forced back into a swimming pool after he climbed out and said
he wanted to quit the air-sea rescue program at Pensacola Naval Air
Station.
   Other recruits were ordered to turn their backs to the pool and
sing the national anthem while Mirecki screamed for help, according
to testimony.
   ``It's not bad punishment,'' Petty Officer 2nd Class Frankie
Deaton, one of the instructors who is appealing, said after the
penalties were ordered June 29 by Rear Adm. David Morris,
then-chief of naval air training in Corpus Christi, Texas.
   ``But, hey, why am I being punished for doing my job?'' Deaton
asked. ``That's all I've done. I am not guilty of a crime. I will
go to my grave thinking that I did nothing wrong. I did nothing
that school hasn't taught me to do.''
   Deaton and Petty Officer 2nd Class John Zelenock were ordered to
forfeit half their basic pay for two months. A one-grade reduction
in rank was suspended on condition they maintain clean records for
six months.
   Petty Officers 1st Class David Smith and Richard Blevins each
were demoted one rank to petty officer 2nd class and are to be
restricted to the base for 30 days.
   All four had been charged with conspiracy to commit battery and
involuntary manslaughter, but the latter charge was dropped in each
case.
   The appeals will go to Morris' successor, Rear Adm. Jimmie W.
Taylor, and then to Vice Adm. N.R. Thunman, Kay Esty, a spokeswoman
for Thunman, said Wednesday. There is no limit on how long the
appeals may take.
   A fifth instructor, Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael Combe, and
Lt. Thomas A. Torchia, the former officer in charge of the Navy's
rescue swimmer school, face court-martial in the case.
   Combe is charged with involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy to
commit battery; Torchia is accused of dereliction of duty. No trial
dates have been set.

<HEAD>Nation's Oldest Veteran Dies at Age 104</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GALVA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Samuel Leroy Mendel, who was turned away from
the Army in 1898 because he was too young to enlist but lived to
become the nation's oldest veteran, died at the age of 104.
   Mendel died in his sleep Wednesday, said a friend, Jim Phillips.
   He was past commander-in-chief of the Spanish-American War
Veteran's Association, despite having never served in the war.
   The Fort Worth, Texas, native was only 14 when the U.S.
battleship Maine was sunk on June 23, 1898, in Havana Harbor, Cuba,
then a Spanish port. But he was unable to enlist in the Army until
after the Spanish-American war officially ended.
   He enlisted in 1901 at age 17, hoping to join in fighting that
continued in Guam, Puerto Rico and the Philippines.
   ``I wanted to go to the Philippines to fight,'' Mendel said in a
1983 interview. ``But they said I was too young ... had to be at
least 20. It was one of the biggest disappointments in my life.''
   Instead of carrying a gun onto the field of battle, Mendel spent
his three-year military career carrying a football on the athletic
fields at Fort Sam Houston. In 1902, he was cited as the best
athlete in the U.S. Army.
   With Mendel's death, the last known veteran of the
Spanish-American war era is Nathan E. Cook, 102, of Tempe, Ariz., a
Navy veteran with 44 years of military service.
   A widower, Mendel is survived by a son, Robert L. Mendel of
Brookfield, a daughter, Fern Varley of San Francisco, two grandsons
and a great-granddaughter.

<HEAD>Shultz Opens Talks With Chinese On Cambodia, Missile Sales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen of China today opened talks on the Cambodian
conflict and U.S. concerns about Chinese missile sales in the
Middle East.
   Shultz, on the sixth stop of a nine-nation Asian tour, arrived
today from Hong Kong for a two-day visit.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Jin Guihua said efforts to end the
nine-year Vietnamese military occupation of Cambodia would top the
agenda.
   China and the United States both demand the withdrawal of
Vietnam's estimated 120,000 troops, but Washington and other
countries have expressed concern that the China-backed Khmer Rouge,
part of a three-party anti-Vietnam resistance, could regain power
when Vietnam leaves.
   The Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot killed more than 1 million
Cambodians through its fanatical agrarian reform policies while
ruling from 1975 until the Vietnamese invasion in late 1978.
   China, the main supplier of arms to the Khmer Rouge, recently
said the Communist group should not be the dominant force in a
future Cambodian government.
   China's Foreign Ministry recently called for freezing military
forces of all sides and nominating for a future government leaders
of various Cambodian factions who are acceptable to all parties.
   The plan effectively would rule out the return of Pol Pot and
other Khmer Rouge leaders linked to past atrocities.
   Vietnam, battered by economic failures at home, has announced
plans to withdraw 50,000 troops this year and the rest by 1991. It
has also agreed to meet representatives of the three-party
resistance coalition in Indonesia later this month.
   Shultz on Friday is to meet senior leader Deng Xiaoping, Premier
Li Peng, Vice Premier Wu Quexian and Communist Party chief Zhao
Ziyang for talks expected to touch on Chinese arms sales to the
Mideast, U.S.-Soviet developments and security at the Seoul Olympic
Games.
   A senior U.S. State Department source said in Hong Kong
Wednesday that Shultz would tell Chinese leaders that their
ballistic missile sales to the Middle East are adding another
element of instability to that volatile region.
   China has sold CSS-2 intermediate-range missiles to Saudi Arabia
and may be marketing a shorter-range weapon, the M-9, which has a
range of between 190 and 370 miles and is still being tested.
   It has denied selling the M-9 to Syria and says the CSS-2s sold
to Saudi Arabia are non-nuclear and defensive.
   Chinese arms sales to the Middle East were also a major topic on
Shultz's last visit to China, in March 1987. He urged China to stop
supplying arms, including Silkworm missiles, to Iran.
   China consistently denies it sells Iran weapons and strongly
criticized Washington's decision last fall to temporarily freeze
relaxation of restrictions on U.S. high technology sales to China
because of the alleged Silkworm sales. Washington lifted the freeze
last March.
   U.S.-Chinese relations are marked by steadily expanding trade,
social, academic, military and scientific links.
   Trade topped $10 billion last year and U.S. investors have
committed $3 billion to Chinese industry, more than any other
nation or region except Hong Kong.
   The Beijing government is actively courting American businessmen
and seeking U.S. participation in China's ambitious development
programs.

   U.S. and Vietnamese officials today
opened talks on the United States' offer to resettle thousands of
people detained in ``reeducation'' camps after the Vietnam War, a
Western diplomat said.
   The Bangkok-based diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said he had no details on the talks being held in Vietnam's
capital, Hanoi. They were expected to last two days.
   Robert L. Funseth, senior deputy assistant secretary of state
for refugee programs, leads the American negotiators.
   Funseth will seek emigration permission for some of the 900,000
former U.S. government employees or officials of the South Vietnam
government who Washington says have spent time in reeducation. Only
a handful have gone to the United States, the world's largest
resettler of Vietnamese refugees.
   The North Vietnamese communists established the reeducation
camps, which usually combined manual labor with ideological study,
after defeating U.S.-backed South Vietnam in April 1975.
   This week's talks were agreed upon during a meeting at the
United Nations in June between Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach of
Vietnam and retired Gen. John W. Vessey, a special U.S.
presidential envoy.
   In announcing the talks, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis
Oakley said most of the inmates were detained because of their U.S.
connections.
   ``For this compelling humanitarian reason, we have repeatedly
affirmed our strong humanitarian desire to resettle those who wish
in the United States as soon as possible,'' she said.
   The United States in 1984 said it was ready to resettle all
those detained for their U.S. ties, but progress was stalled by the
lack of diplomatic ties with Vietnam. Washington has tried to
isolate Vietnam because of its 9-year-old military occupation of
Cambodia.
   Vietnamese leaders, calling for national reconciliation, freed
hundreds of former South Vietnamese officials in September 1987 and
February this year. Vice Minister of Information Phan Quang said on
Feb. 11 that only 150 former officials were still held.
   After meeting with Vessey, Thach said the former prisoners could
leave but that the United States must guarantee they won't be
allowed to engage in activities hostile to Vietnam. U.S. officials
have said this was not possible because of the constitutional right
to free speech.
   Funseth's team also includes Jeffrey Millington, director of the
State Department's office of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia and Bruce
Beardsley, director of refugee affairs at the U.S. Embassy in
Bangkok.
   The talks came a day after Vietnam repatriated what may be the
remains of 25 American servicemen missing in action from the war.
It was one of the largest turnovers ever. The remains were flown
from Hanoi to an army laboratory in Honolulu for analysis.
   An official Vietnam News Agency report seen today said Vietnam
has returned the remains of 241 missing Americans and information
on 45 others whose remains ``are determined to be no longer in
existence.'' A total of 1,761 Americans are still missing in
Vietnam.

<TEXT>
   A manual that compares jailers to lion
tamers and calls inmates ``big cats'' who may need their food
drugged to calm them has been withdrawn from a jail staff-training
program.
   Titled ``The Lion Tamer,'' the illustrated six-page pamphlet has
been in circulation since 1982 and was used to train at least 50
Santa Clara County deputies.
   Sheriff Robert Winter on Wednesday ordered the guide removed as
he soon as he found out about its existence, said Sgt. Cary Colla.
   ``All big cats aren't the same,'' the text reads. ``You got your
African lions, you got your Bengal tigers, you got your pumas and
you got your leopards. Now your African lions come from Africa.
Your Bengal tigers come from Asia. Your pumas come from the
southwest or south of the border.''
   It goes on to refer to the ``leopards'' as crazy and say that
they may need to have their food ``doped.''
   The guide uses sexual slang to describe the positive side of
working as a jailer.
   ``Little kids and old ladies are dazzled by the lion tamer.
Young ladies fall in love. ... I mean, he is one macho S.O.B.,''
the manual says.
   A spokesman for the Sheriff's Department denied that prisoners
are drugged.
   But William Frazier, a Contra Costa County sheriff's officer who
wrote the guide, conceded that drugs are routinely used in jails to
control mentally ill or violent inmates who have taken PCP.
   Frazier denied that the book is racist or sexist.
   ``It's misunderstood,'' he said. ``We're not training nuns to
run a convent. I've been told by more officers that this appealed
to their fears.''
   The guide was part of a course taught by Naber Technical
Enterprises, a private Novato firm contracted by the jail to train
workers.
   ``The potential for violence is real and we wanted something to
guide a staff apprehensive about losing barriers between themselves
and inmates,'' said Bill Naber, president of the company. ``The
analogy was not meant to be demeaning.''

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev told
Polish intellectuals today that the basic goal of his reform
program is to ensure that working people live a better life.
   Gorbachev said he wants to return to the approach of Vladimir I.
Lenin, founder of the Soviet state, who he said staged a revolution
against exploitation to make man ``master of his own spirit.''
   The Soviet leader, on a six-day tour of Poland, spoke to several
dozen academics, writers, scientists and cultural figures in the
ornate gilded ballroom of Warsaw's Royal Castle. Polish state
television broadcast the meeting.
   A Polish physicist in the audience thanked Gorbachev for the
decision by the Soviet Communist Party conference to erect a
monument in Moscow to victims of the late Soviet dictator, Josef
Stalin.
   The scientist, Jan Rychlewski, said his father was among the
Polish communists who disappeared in Stalin's purges.
   ``We will treat this monument as his grave,'' the physicist told
Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev, speaking in Russian, told his audience that during a
stop at a farmer's house near Sczcecin on Wednesday, he was asked
what he was trying to accomplish with ``perestroika,'' his program
to restructure and modernize the Soviet economy and society.
   ``Simply, we want, in spite of everything ... for working people
to lead a better life,'' Gorbachev said he replied.
   Gorbachev, who grew up on a farm in southern Russia, added that
socialism must make humanitarianism its most important achievement.
   By improving the lives of the people in both the Soviet Union
and Poland, all other fields of life will be transformed as well,
Gorbachev said.
   Intellectuals can offer their support to reconstruction and
renewal, but its main goal is to improve the lives of workers and
farmers, Gorbachev said. On the ``train of perestroika'' he said,
``these are the most significant and main passengers.''
   Later, Gorbachev drove across town to party headquarters to meet
with the leadership of the communist Polish United Workers Party.
   On Wednesday, Gorbachev told about 3,000 shipyard workers in
Sczcecin he is looking to Poland for ideas to help solve economic
problems at home and avoid making costly political mistakes.
   ``We find many useful things in your experiences,'' he said.
   The speech was greeted with polite applause but little outward
enthusiasm by the workers, who were admitted by invitation. The
Soviet Union buys about half the ships built at the yard, once a
Solidarity stronghold.
   Attempts by Poland's communist authorities to revive the
nation's stagnant economy are complicated by the Soviet bloc's best
organized opposition.
   Solidarity, the outlawed independent labor federation, was
stifled in a 1981 military crackdown. But dissatisfaction with
communist authorities' unwillingness to share some measure of power
or allow free trade unions is still strong enough to trigger
disruptive strikes.
   Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski also is embarked on a reform
campaign, and both leaders have stressed their common goals during
the Soviet leader's visit.
   But Poland has so far failed in its attempt to bring prices more
in line with actual costs and trim heavy government subsidies.
   Gorbachev told his nation's Communist Party conference last
month that a similar revision of the state-set price system is
crucial to the success of his economic reforms.
   Jaruzelski's government raised prices an average of 40 percent
this year, almost immediately touching off a wave of strikes.
   Wage pressure quickly outpaced the increases, triggering
inflation that has hit 60 percent so far this year.
   Polish leaders now acknowledge that their price reform effort
was a failure.
   Gorbachev later paid a private visit to an agricultural complex
that serves as a model of high-productivity farming in western
Poland. He also stopped at a prize-winning beef and dairy farm
owned by Franciszek Bakan. Private farmers till most of Poland's
arable land.
   Gorbachev has proposed that the Soviet Union return to family
farming by leasing land to farmers to increase crop production and
reduce the nation's dependence on grain imports.

   Toy California raisins attached to boxes of Post
Raisin Bran have proved to be easy pickings for light-fingered
supermarket patrons.
   Of 36 cereal boxes recently put on the shelves of one grocery
store, 30 were relieved of their raisin figures. The figures are
based on the raisins seen dancing to ``Heard It Through the
Grapevine'' in TV commercials.
   The raisin figures were put in separate containers glued to the
tops of the cereal boxes. General Foods Corp. launched the
promotion two weeks ago.
   ``Maybe one or two people actually bothered to buy the cereal to
get the toy,'' said Gary Ringer, night manager of a supermarket.
``The rest we just packed up and shipped back to the warehouse and
said, `Thanks, but we'd rather just have our money back.'
   ``No one's going to buy a mangled box.''

<HEAD>Angry Senate Sends Warning to Sandinistas</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In an unprecedented show of bipartisan unity,
the Senate is warning Nicaragua's Sandinista government it could
face renewed U.S. military aid to the Contra rebels unless it
reverses ``dramatic new steps in brutality'' against its own
citizens.
   In what some senators called a ``carrot and stick policy,''
adopted on a 91-4 vote, the Senate also said it was ready to extend
U.S. economic aid to Nicaragua if the Sandinistas fully comply with
commitments made a year ago and ``proceed to permit the
establishment of a democratic system.''
   The ``sense of the Senate'' resolution is non-binding.
   But the wide bipartisan coalition which swung behind it
emphasized the anger and concern caused by recent Sandinista
actions to suppress dissent.
   These include the closing of the opposition newspaper La Prensa
and Nicaragua's Catholic radio station, the suppression of a
non-violent demonstration in Managua, the arrest of 40 opposition
political leaders and the expulsion of U.S. Ambassador Richard
Melton and seven other U.S. diplomats.
   ``You can say it's only a sense of the Senate resolution, but in
my view it means a great deal,'' said Senate Republican leader Bob
Dole of Kansas.
   Dole told his colleagues: ``We are moving now because the
Sandinista goons have been in the streets of Managua again; because
the Sandinista jails are filling up with new prisoners; because
what little independent media there has ever been in Nicaragua is
being closed down again; and because the light of freedom in
Nicaragua has been nearly snuffed out again.''
   The resolution states in part: ``The Sandinistas should
understand that blatant violations (of last year's peace agreement)
and the human rights of the Nicaraguan people could cause Congress
to consider the provision of additional humanitarian and other
appropriate assistance, including military aid, if conditions
should so warrant.''
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., said that by their actions, ``the
Sandinistas have shown their true colors.''
   Military aid to the Contras was suspended in hopes that the
Central American peace process would take hold but Boren said: ``We
have tried removing the pressure and all we have done is harm the
cause of peace.
   ``If the Sandinistas continue down this path they will leave us
no choice but to resume the pressure, even military pressure if

Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, and William Proxmire, D-Wis., voted against
the resolution. Not voting were Sens. Joseph R. Biden, D-Del.,
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., Larry Pressler, R-S.D., John Stennis, D-Miss.,
and Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
   Meanwhile, the permanent council of the Organization of American
States planned a late afternoon meeting today at the request of
Nicaraguan Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann.
   Tunnermann, who serves as both ambassador to the OAS and the
United States, is expected to press his view that the Reagan
administration cannot legally expel a diplomat assigned to the OAS.
   On Tuesday, Reagan announced that Tunnermann and seven of his
colleagues had 72 hours to leave the country. The action was taken
after Nicaragua expelled Melton and the other U.S. diplomats from
Managua.
   The State Department maintains that Tunnermann engaged in
``abuses'' of his privileges of residence here and that his
expulsion is therefore both lawful and warranted. It has given no
details of the alleged abuses, but one official said privately they
are based on FBI investigations.
   Meanwhile, the director general of the Nicaraguan Foreign
Ministry, Alejandro Bendana, provided what he said was further
proof that U.S. diplomats in Managua were not engaging in
acceptable diplomatic behavior.
   Appearing on PBS' ``MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour'' Wednesday night,
Bendana held up a photograph showing what he claimed were three
members of the U.S. Embassy staff ``openly taunting'' police
officers on duty at an anti-government demonstration.
   Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead, who appeared on the
same program, said the envoys attended the rally as observers and
not participants. He called Bendana's charges ``absurd and
outrageous.''
   Bendana said that Melton also had associated himself with
``extreme right businessmen'' in Nicaragua who favor the overthrow
of Nicaragua's government.
   He defended the closing of independent media outlets, saying
they had operated outside Nicaragua's ``legal framework.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Unconcerned About Issues Differences With Bentsen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis says Democratic running mate
Lloyd Bentsen will disagree with him on some issues but their
campaign will stress the general themes the two men can agree on.
   ``We're going to agree and we do agree on most issues,'' the
likely Democratic nominee said Wednesday. ``We'll disagree on some,
but we both share a deep and abiding commitment to economic growth
and opportunity for the people of this country.
   ``And that will be the central thrust of our campaign,'' the
Massachusetts governor said at a news conference with the Texas
senator.
   ``He wasn't looking for a clone of Michael Dukakis,'' Bentsen
said. ``He is a man who will reach out to differing viewpoints.''
   Bentsen is more conservative than Dukakis on several issues.
   He favors supporting the Contra rebels in Nicaragua, voted for
President Reagan's 1981 tax cuts, and supports a constitutional
amendment to balance the budget. He also supported building the B-1
bomber and the MX missile, and has voted for allowing prayer in
schools and imposing the death penalty.
   ``His job is to vote as he sees fit in the Senate and I assume
he will continue to do so,'' said Dukakis, who opposed all of
those. He said Bentsen's different thinking would be a strength.
   ``One of the reasons I picked Lloyd Bentsen is because I know
that he will challenge me,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis used the questioning to get in a dig at Vice President
George Bush, the likely Republican nominee, saying he expects
Bentsen would ``come right into my office'' if the National
Security Council was considering a ``cockamamie'' idea like selling
arms to Iran.

   A military jury has convicted
a Navy petty officer of killing a ship's paymaster and stealing
$94,000.
   The five-officer panel was to reconvene today to decide whether
Petty Officer 1st Class Ruben Colon should be sentenced to death in
the slaying March 15 of Lt. j.g. Ratish Prasad, 24, aboard the
destroyer USS John Hancock at dock here.
   Colon, 34, an electronic warfare technician, was convicted
Wednesday of murder, robbery and kidnapping.
   Both the prosecution and defense attorneys declined comment
after the verdict.
   The death penalty can be considered because Colon was found to
have committed a murder during a robbery.
   The last Navy execution was in 1849, when two mutineers were
hanged in San Francisco.
   In closing arguments Tuesday, a prosecutor said Colon choked
Prasad until he lost consciousness, shot him in the head, buried
him in a ``pile of seabags'' and then emptied the ship's safe.
   Afterward, investigators searched three of Colon's safe-deposit
boxes and found $87,350 in cash and 2,575 blank U.S. Treasury
checks bearing the destroyer's imprint.

   Richard Thornburgh, President Reagan's choice
as the next attorney general, said today he will talk to top
Justice Department officials in the next week about improving
morale following the departure of Edwin Meese III.
   ``I want to take a very careful look at what the level of
commitment and what the level of morale is within the department,''
Thornburgh said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' program.
   ``I hope within the next week or so to begin some conversations
with key people in the department so I can make that assessment (of
morale) and we can deal with whatever problems exist there,'' said
Thornburgh, who was interviewed from Boston.
   The former Pennsylvania governor said he would provide ``a firm
hand at the tiller'' of the department.
   Reagan named Thornburgh, a former prosecutor and head of the
Justice Department's criminal division, to replace Meese, who
announced his resignation July 5 after saying a special
prosecutor's report cleared him of allegations of wrongdoing.
   Meese, who will depart in late July or early August, said he was
not leaving the department in disarray.
   Several top aides had only been on the job less than two months
and two high department officials resigned in March to protest
Meese's continued tenure. Replacements for those people were found
only after a highly public search in which the attorney general was
rejected by other recruits.
   Asked in a separate interview today on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning
America'' program about possible morale problems, Thornburgh said,
``Obviously there have been some distractions and a lot of pressure
in recent months. But I think that can be dealt with appropriately
with a firm hand at the tiller.''
   ``Everybody has their own management style,'' Thornburgh, 55,
said when asked how he would differ from Meese.
   ``What I hope to bring is a firm management style and a
commitment to the principles that make for firm and fair law
enforcement. I would much prefer to look forward than look back.''
   Thornburgh, considered a moderate in Republican circles, also
left open the possibility that he would accept an offer to stay on
in the post if Vice President George Bush is elected president in
November.
   ``That's a question that Vice President Bush would have to
decide if he were elected. It's no secret that I am a supporter of
the vice president,'' Thornburgh said on ABC. ``I'll take it on one
day at a time and see what ensues.''
   There has been speculation that Thornburgh might be tabbed as
Bush's running mate in the fall.
   ``That's George Bush's decision,'' Thornburgh told NBC.
``Obviously when an offer like that is forthcoming from a political
leader the stature of George Bush, it would get serious
consideration.''

   City Council has accused CBS of airing an episode
of ``Mighty Mouse'' in which the superhero rodent snorts cocaine.
   The council Wednesday unanimously adopted a resolution
condemning the network after Councilman Charles Tandy, an
anesthesiologist, showed a still from the episode in which Mighty
Mouse sniffs a light-colored substance.
   ``What else do people snort up their noses but cocaine?'' said
Tandy, an anesthesiologist. ``I know of only one other thing, and
that's a type of medicine for asthma, but I don't think this was
that.''
   No one at CBS' New York headquarters was immediately available
for comment on the council's action, but the network last month
vehemently denied the allegations when they were raised by a
citizens group.
   In a letter to the group, CBS said the character was enjoying a
mass of crushed stems, tomatoes and flowers a former girlfriend had
given him. The network said there was ``no change of mood or
behavior' after the flowers reached his nose.
   CBS first aired the episode April 23.
   The resolution, in which the council urged CBS to begin
immediately a campaign of anti-drug public service announcements
aimed at children, will be forwarded to CBS and the Federal
Communications Commission.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court today convicted a Palestinian
believed linked to a terrorist attack on a Greek cruise ship of
entering the country illegally and sentenced him to seven months in
prison.
   Dozens of police with automatic weapons stood guard at the
Athens courthouse where Mohammed Rashid was tried before a
three-judge panel. Plainclothes officers packed the courtroom.
   ``I am a member of the PLO and the Palestine Liberation Army. I
was passing through Greece on a secret mission,'' Rashid, 34,
testified.
   ``The Americans are trying to convince people the Palestinians
staged the cruise ship massacre so that I would be released. This
is not true,'' he added.
   Rashid, 34, was accused of entering Greece May 25 with a false
Syrian passport. Police believe gunmen planned to hijack the City
of Poros cruise ship Monday in an attempt to free Rashid.
   Nine people were killed and 98 wounded when terrorists opened
fire on the ship with machine guns and hurled grenades.
   In Bagdhad, Iraq, a spokesman for Palestine Liberation
Organization chairman Yasser Arafat said the group condemned the
ship attack.
   Rashid is also wanted in the United States for allegedly
planting a bomb on a Pan Am jetliner in 1982 that killed one person
and injured 15.
   Rashid claimed his real name was Mohammed Hamdam. He said the
passport used to enter Greece was forged but added, ``We are a
refugee people and rarely can get papers.'' He said the passport
was given to him by his PLO superiors.
   The prosecution asked for a 10-month sentence.
   Greece says it is considering a U.S. extradition request but
that Rashid would have to serve his Greek sentence before he could
be sent to the United States.
   Rashid spoke in Arabic. His testimony was translated for the
court by a translator of the PLO mission in Athens. The trial took
90 minutes.
   Rashid's lawyer, Spyros Fytrakis, asked for Rashid to be freed
pending appeal, but presiding Judge Mihalis Margaritis ordered his
continued detention at Korydallos jail near Athens.
   Rashid was brought to the court Wednesday, but the trial was
held over for a day because his lawyer and interpreter were
unavailable.
   On Wednesday, a previously unknown group linked with
Palestinians claimed responsibility in Beirut for the ship attack.
   Premier Andreas Papandreou's socialist government was sharply
criticized in Parliament by the main right-wing opposition New
Democracy Party. It complained that the government failed to
protect innocent tourists at a time of heightened world tension.
   ``After the shooting down of the Iranian Airbus, it was possible
that there would be waves of terrorism and that Greek territory
could be threatened,'' said parliamentary deputy Nicolaos Kostakis.
   He was referring to the U.S. downing of an Iranian airliner on
July 3 over the Persian Gulf, killing all 290 people aboard. The
Pentagon says the plane was mistaken for a fighter.
   Merchant Marine Minister Evangelos Yiannopoulos denied the
government had been lax toward terrorists.
   The exact number of terrorists in the attack remained unclear,
with most accounts by survivors and authorities putting the figure
at three or four.
   In Beirut Wednesday, a group calling itself ``The Organization
of the Martyrs of the Popular Revolution in Palestine'' claimed
responsiblity for the attack in a statement delivered to a Western
news agency.
   It said the attack was in retaliation for ``the escalation in
the operations and murder and extermination by the murderous
Zionist-American gangs in Palestine, Lebanon, the (Persian) Gulf
and all over the world.''
   The statement also claimed responsibility for the explosion of a
car near the cruise ship's home dock about six hours before the
attack on the vessel. The blast killed two people in the car.
   Police speculated the two were accomplices of the ship attackers
and that automatic weapons, grenades and explosives found in the
car were intended for hijacking the ship.

<TEXT>
   A Dutch court today sentenced an
unemployed business consultant to 20 years in prison for the
kidnapping and murder of a Dutch grocery tycoon.
   Ferdi Elsas, 45, was found guilty last month of kidnapping and
shooting Gerrit Jan Heijn, vice president of the
multimillion-dollar Ahold retail concern. Heijn was abducted Sept.
9. His body was found buried in a forest in April.
   Heijn's family paid about $4 million ransom in cash and diamonds.
   Elsas appeared unmoved when Court President C. Terwee read a
summary of the ruling. It was not immediately disclosed whether
Elsas would appeal.
   Heijn, who was 56 at the time of his abduction, was seized at
gunpoint outside his home while leaving for a dental appointment.
   At his trial, Elsas testified that after jumping into the retail
executive's car, he forced Heijn to drive to Renkum near Arnhem in
the eastern Netherlands.
   There, the two walked through a forest for hours, and, after
sharing some sandwiches and orange juice, Elsas killed Heijn with a
shot through the back of his head, according to Elsas' testimony.
   Elsas buried his victim in a grave he had dug weeks before.
   Elsas was arrested after police discovered a 250-guilder note
from the ransom, which surfaced in an Amsterdam supermarket close
to Elsas' house.

   West German officials today
released a photograph of a car sought in connection with an IRA
bomb attack that injured nine British soldiers.
   Two bombs exploded outside a British army barracks in this
residential town before dawn Wednesday, blasting a hole through a
wall and tearing off part of the roof. Nine soldiers were treated
at the scene for injuries.
   At about the same time as the explosion, shots were fired from a
speeding car at a police road check. No one was injured in the
shooting, but the BMW sedan bearing Dutch license plates got away.
   ``The federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe has now released
a photograph of the car to the news media to help in tracing it,''
Duisburg police spokesman Reinhard Pape said today in a telephone
interview.
   Col. Michel Baugniet, chief spokesman for the British army in
West Germany, said he could not provide any information on the
progress of the investigation.
   ``The federal criminal police are leading the investigation, and
they haven't released anything on it,'' Baugniet said.
   About 500 soldiers from the British army's 3rd Armored Division
Transport Regiment are based in Duisburg, 30 miles north of
Cologne, as are soldiers from the regiment's 35 Squadron, which
served in Northern Ireland in 1987.
   The blast Wednesday was the latest in a series of attacks by the
Irish Republican Army on British targets on the European continent.
The group is waging a guerrilla campaign to drive the British out
of Northern Ireland.
   In a statement released in Dublin, the IRA said it carried out
``the bomb attack in West Germany against crown forces.'' It did
not elaborate.
   On March 6 in Gibraltar, British commandos killed three unarmed
IRA guerrillas. In apparent retaliation, IRA terrorists killed
three British airmen in the Netherlands in two separate attacks May
1.
   Two days later, a car bomb was found at a British military base
in the central West German city of Bielefeld. The bomb was
discovered by an alert guard and disposed of before it could
explode.
   A March 1987 car-bomb attack on a British army headquarters in
the West German city of Rheindahlen was the first IRA strike in
continental Europe in about a decade. The blast injured 31 people.

<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis is no more and no less a liberal
today than he was before he recruited Lloyd Bentsen for his
Democratic ticket.
   He is not the man who will be changing or tempering his views.
He's the boss.
   Bentsen's arrival offers a gesture to the conservative
Democratic establishment, to the ways of Washington and Congress,
perhaps to the world of finance and business. It should help New
Englander Dukakis in the South, especially in Texas, with its 29
electoral votes.
   But the Bentsen selection does not affect Dukakis or the
policies he has been describing during the long campaign that will
reach one climax with his presidential nomination next Wednesday.
   That's not the way ticket-making works. It won't this time,
either, notwithstanding Dukakis' statement that he wanted Bentsen
because he wants a vice president ``who will challenge me.'' The
challenge, presumably, would be intellectual, not political and
certainly not public.
   Dukakis may indeed amend some of his positions in the campaign
months ahead, and in office if he gets there. Responsibility tends
to temper rhetoric, although that is likely to be less a factor for
Dukakis than for politicians past.
   The Massachusetts governor has been proceeding with caution all
along. That is his style and it is reflected in the condensed and
generalized campaign platform the Democratic convention will adopt
next week.
   Any visible changes in position will be made by the Democratic
senator from Texas. At a minimum, where his public record is at
odds with Dukakis, the rule for vice presidential nominees is
silence.
   He won't have to swallow nearly the mouthful Vice President Bush
did after campaigning against Ronald Reagan's tax cut proposal as
``voodoo economics.'' Bush, who will face Dukakis for presidency on
Nov. 8, went from that line to unflinching loyalty as Reagan's
running mate and then vice president. He once joked that it was his
most memorable political utterance _ and he regretted saying it.
   There's nothing nearly as clear or dramatic standing between
Dukakis and Bentsen. Dukakis said he expects Bentsen to continue
doing his duty and setting his own course as senator from Texas. He
didn't add the corollary, nor was it necessary.
   Nominees for vice president are not independent operators. They
are junior partners, even when they are senior. The presidential
nominee runs the show.
   That wouldn't have worked with Jesse Jackson, who had advertised
his willingness to accept the nomination with Dukakis. He is not a
supporting player.
   By Jackson's account, he should have been offered the nomination
because he was the major alternative to Dukakis throughout the
primary season. Dukakis needs the black candidate now, and the
Democrats need the black votes he can rally.
   But No. 2 on the ticket doesn't necessarily go to No. 2 in the
campaign, even though some vice presidential choices have been made
as gestures to losers and their constituencies. In contests for
presidential nominations, it is winner take all. And it is up to
the winner to decide how and where to compromise, to temper
positions, to make the gestures that can bind campaign wounds.
   Originally, the vice president was chosen for being second. Each
member of the electoral college got to cast two votes. Whoever got
the most was president, whoever ran second became vice president.
But that only lasted until 1804, when the Constitution was amended
to provide separate votes on the two offices.
   An early member of Congress, Roger Griswold of Connecticut, saw
a risk in that change. ``The office will generally be carried into
the market to be exchanged for the votes of some large state for
president,'' he warned.
   ``The greatest danger is that the man just nominated for
president will try desperately to heal the wounds and placate the
dissidents in his party,'' said Henry A. Wallace, a one-term vice
president, a decade after he was dumped from the Democratic ticket
in 1944. ``My battle cry would be no more deals and no more
balancing of the ticket.''
   That sounds good. It won't happen.

   A 10-year dispute over alleged construction flaws
in the Comanche Peak nuclear plant has ended with regulators
endorsing a $10 million settlement between opponents and the
plant's parent utility.
   The deal between the Citizens Association for Sound Energy, the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Texas Utilities, Comanche Peak's
operator, ends the last major citizens' opposition to NRC licensing
of the nearly completed plant. ``To me, it's a stunner ... 10 years
of fighting this plant (is over),'' Anthony Roisman, an attorney
for CASE, said Wednesday during the final meeting of the Dallas
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board.
   The three-member board, chaired by Peter Bloch of the NRC,
officially dissolved at the end of Wednesday's hearing.
   It had been formed to investigate CASE's allegations.
   The dispute, which spanned nearly a decade, resulted in the cost
of Comanche Peak to balloon from an estimate of under $1 billion to
$9.1 billion.
   Bloch praised Jack Doyle, a former Comanche Peak engineer who
resigned to point out flaws to the NRC that included faulty welds,
metallurgy and pipe.
   ``Though he isn't a degreed engineer, he knew the truth about
this plant when people who were hired for millions of dollars
either didn't know the truth or refused to see it,'' Bloch said.
   Last week, CASE agreed to drop opposition to Comanche Peak in
exchange for a five-year term for its leader, Juanita Ellis, on a
committee overseeing the plant.
   CASE also will be reimbursed $4.5 million in legal fees and
other expenses by Texas Utilities, utility attorney George Edgar
said.
   In addition, Texas Utilities will set aside $5.5 million to
cover any damages it might have to pay in some other legal actions,
said spokesman Dick Ramsey. Some 50 workers involved in the
construction of the plant have suits pending with the Labor
Department charging construction flaws, said Ms. Ellis.
   In 1984, when the utility began to address the issues raised by
CASE in 1978, Doyle said ``the cooperation has been unbelievable.
At first I thought I was being conned _ I had to be conned. I now
know that was not the case.''

<HEAD>Two Palestinians Wounded in Clash With Soldiers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Palestinian protesters fought with Israeli
soldiers in the West Bank city of Nablus after reports that two
teen-agers wounded in earlier clashes had died. Hospital officials
said today that two protesters were shot.
   A 12-year-old boy from the Jewish West Bank settlement Gidot
Shomron was struck in the head by a rock in the nearby Arab city of
Qalqiliya, the army said. He lost consciousness for several hours
but was reported in good condition today.
   Dozens of enraged settlers tried to enter Qalqiliya after
Wednesday night's attack but were turned away by soldiers, the army
said. The army is investigating reports that the windshields of
three Arab-owned cars in the city were smashed.
   A small bomb apparently planted by Palestinian militants
exploded today just outside Tel Aviv University. The blast did not
cause injuries or damage, police said.
   In predominantly Arab East Jerusalem, police arrested a
16-year-old Arab caught throwing an empty bottle at an Israeli bus.
It was one of a chain of at least six stone- and bottle-throwing
incidents in the city.
   No one was hurt in the incidents, a police spokesman said.
   The army identified an Israeli soldier killed in a firefight
with Shiite Moslem guerrillas in southern Lebanon as Lt. Uri Maoz,
22, of Yesod Hama'allah near the Lebanese border. Three guerrillas
also were killed in Wednesday's battle.
   Two Nablus teen-agers who were shot Monday in clashes with
Israeli troops died Wednesday, hospital officials said. The
fatalities brought to 222 the number of Palestinians killed in the
7-month-old Arab uprising. Four Israelis have died.
   The deaths sparked fresh protests Wednesday night in Nablus, the
largest West Bank city and a focal point of recent violence.
   About 30 Arabs took to the streets and stoned Israeli soldiers,
army officials said.
   Two Palestinians, a 26-year-old man and a 24-year-old woman,
were shot in the clash, said officials at Nablus' Al Ittihad
Hospital. The man was reported in serious condition with a bullet
wound in his stomach.
   Army officials said they knew of an Arab being shot and were
investigating the circumstances of the shooting.
   Maoz was the eighth Israeli soldier to be killed this year in
clashes in southern Lebanon or during guerrilla infiltration
attempts into Israel. About 30 Israelis have been wounded.
   More than 110 Arab guerrillas also have been killed this year,
according to Israeli reports.
   Also Wednesday, chief military prosecutor Brig. Gen. Amnon
Strashnov said 1,500 Palestinians held without charges in so-called
administrative detention have filed appeals.
   Military judges issues rulings in 450 cases, and in 100 appeals
ordered the detention period reduced or the prisoner released,
Israel army radio said.
   In Arab east Jerusalem, assailants stoned four Israeli buses and
a private car, Israel radio said. In one incident, a soldier aboard
a bus fired in the air as he chased the stone-throwers. Police
arriving at the scene arrested a 16-year-old Arab.

   City Council allies of Mayor Eugene Sawyer have
stripped power from his key opponents in a meeting marked by
name-calling and police intervention, driving a deeper political
wedge into the city's black community.
   ``This just opens all the old wounds,'' said political scientist
Paul Kleppner of Northern Illinois University.
   Most white aldermen voted to oust eight opponents of the black
mayor, including several influential black aldermen, from committee
chairmanships during an unruly council meeting that ended late
Wednesday.
   At one point during the meeting, police officers rushed to the
floor to break up a near-fight between Dorothy Tillman, a black
Sawyer critic, and Marlene Carter, a black Sawyer ally.
   ``One more step and I would have put her on the floor,'' Ms.
Tillman told reporters. ``My mama didn't buy me dolls when I was a
girl.''
   The session was reminiscent of the raucous, all-night council
meeting in December when Sawyer, then an alderman, was named to
succeed Harold Washington, the city's first black mayor, a week
after Washington's death. Sawyer was supported then by many of the
same white aldermen who helped reshape the committees Wednesday.
   Sawyer told reporters he would have preferred to wait until the
end of the month to restructure committee leadership so he could
get more support for the plan. But he said the majority of the
council ``got anxious.''
   ``I had to seize control,'' he said.
   ``We have an agenda to move, a city to run. They have another
agenda,'' he said of his opponents, ``and it's not mine.''
   Allies of the mayor said the committee reassignments were
necessary because Sawyer's opponents were using their posts to
spoil his administration.
   Sawyer needed a ``real balanced reorganization,'' said Michael
Sheahan, a white supporter.
   But opponents predicted further erosion in Sawyer's black
political base.
   Many of the blacks in the gallery shouted, ``Go home, Uncle
Tom!'' to some of the black aldermen who defended the purge.
   ``Mr. Mayor, I think you've made a terrible mistake,'' alderman
Danny Davis said on the Council floor, pointing a finger at Sawyer.
``It looks like everything we fought for, that Harold Washington
died for, is being turned back.
   ``I guess you and your colleagues have declared war in the black
community.''
   Davis is one of three ousted aldermen who have indicated they
will run against Sawyer for mayor.
   Kleppner, who has tracked voting patterns in Chicago for the
U.S. Justice Department, said Sawyer will find few political gains.
   ``He can't go back to his normal constituency _ blacks,''
Kleppner said. ``There's no place else but to go to the white
ethnics, the opponents of Harold Washington, who put (Sawyer) there
in the first place.''

   A contestant in a single-handed
trans-Atlantic yacht race who had not been heard from since late
last month has been found but with her sloop in a shambles.
   ``I feel fine, wonderful,'' said Noelle Corbett of Miami. ``But
I feel very disappointed to have come this far and not be able to
finish the race.''
   Corbett, 33, was found Tuesday aboard her 39-foot sloop,
Outrageous, by a fishing boat, authorities said. She was one of the
last remaining contestants in the Carlsberg Single-Handed
Transatlantic Yacht Race.
   Corbett's sloop, which was less than 100 miles from the finish
line in Newport when found, was towed into Woods Hole, Mass., by a
Coast Guard cutter.
   Corbett said she weathered three gales during her crossing from
Plymouth, England. The boom of her yacht was broken. Part of her
rigging was broken. Her sails were in shreds, except for one small
headsail, the only one she could use. She had no electric power for
the last 10 days and her autopilot was out of commission.
   She said her husband, Jim, plans to repair the yacht at Woods
Hole and make the rest of the trip under power to Newport, she said.
   More than 90 sailors left Plymouth on June 5. Seventy-one have
finished the race; 21, including Corbett, have withdrawn, and three
British sailors are still at sea.

<TEXT>
   The Afghan guerrilla alliance has
agreed to direct talks with the Soviet Union about prisoners of
war, the alliance chairman said today.
   Sayed Ahmad Gailani refused to say whether the decision cancels
earlier guerrilla vows to keep Soviet prisoners of war for leverage
in future talks on a new Afghan government.
   There was no immediate comment from the Soviets.
   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, leader of one of two Hezb-e-Islami factions
within the seven-party guerrilla alliance, claims to have ``a good
number'' of Soviet prisoners. Last week, he had said no
negotiations for their release would take place ``until all Soviets
leave all Afghanistan.''
   But Wednesday's decision to negotiate with the Soviets was
unanimous.
   Farooq Azam, with Gailani's National Islamic Front of
Afghanistan, said reports reaching the guerrilla alliance say the
Soviets are ready to negotiate with the guerrillas about prisoners
of war.
   The Soviet Union says 312 soldiers are missing. The guerrillas
refuse to say how many prisoners they hold.
   The International Committee for the Red Cross has been given
responsibility for prisoners of war, said Diego Cordovez, U.N.
special envoy, but the guerrillas say they will talk only to a
Soviet delegation. Talks must be direct or not at all, said Azam.
   Gailani refused to say whether the alliance decision means the
guerrilla groups will pool their prisoners and decide their fate as
a single unit or whether they will remain prisoners of individual
groups.
   In March, representatives of Hekmatyar's group met with a Soviet
delegation to negotiate a prisoner exchange, and a formula of one
Soviet prisoner for 25 Afghan guerrillas was struck. However,
Hekmatyar cancelled the agreement after an agreement was signed
April 14 in Geneva, under which the Soviets agreed to withdraw
their troops from Afghanistan.
   The only prisoner exchange since the accord was in late June,
when Rasoul Sayyaf's Ittehad-e-Islami group turned over one Soviet
soldier for seven Afghan prisoners.
   Gailani said the decision to open direct talks with the Soviet
Union on prisoner exchanges was made on ``humanitarian grounds.''
   The Soviets entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to help the
Marxist government fight the guerrillas, who wanted to set up an
Islamic state.

   Men and women who seek to become
bishops in the United Methodist Church are supposed to wait for
their ``calling,'' but some of them also believe it helps to
campaign a little for the job.
   Seven new bishops _ a record for the jurisdiction _ will be
elected at this week's Southeastern Jurisdictional Conference
before the gathering of 588 Methodists from nine Southeastern
states ends Saturday.
   In the weeks leading up to the meeting, some of the 14 official
candidates issued brochures touting themselves. Some of them also
have a member of their delegation acting as campaign manager.
   Campaigning is nothing new to the jurisdiction, but some
observers believe it has become more of a factor this year.
   ``I believe God can live with this process better than the
backroom politics of past years,'' said one delegate, Nowell
Bingham of Murray, Ky.
   The current nominating system was put into effect back in the
1970s in an effort to open up the election process, said Bob Lear,
director of the United Methodist News Service in Washington.
   Before that, he said, most of the work was done behind the
scenes.
   ``The nominating system has had the affect of making the
politics more intense,'' said Lear, who has been covering church
elections since 1960. ``I have a stack of campaign brochures in my
office to prove it.''
   Under the new system, candidates go before their local
conference to explain their positions. The local delegates then
decide which candidate from their area to endorse. Delegates to the
regional conference make the final selection.
   Retired Bishop H. Ellis Finger, of Knoxville, Tenn., was elected
in 1964, before the nominating system existed.
   ``There obviously were conversations but you weren't required to
appear before the delegates for an inquiry,'' he said. ``A person
who was elected in those years was presented in conversation, in
dialogue.''
   C.R. Hager, a delegate from Lexington, Ky., was a member of the
committee that revised the election system.
   ``There was a lot of concern about the advertising,'' he said.
``Before that, it wasn't public. It was a calling, so a candidate
wasn't supposed to get out to publicize himself.''
   Hager believes the current system is far superior to the old
one. ``It gives us the opportunity to know about the candidates,''
he said.
   Bingham said all 14 official candidates met with the various
delegations at the church's general conference earlier this year in
St. Louis. ``We videotaped it so we could bring it back for our
church members to review,'' he said.

   A draft version of Ann Richards' keynote
speech to the Democratic National Convention was lost in a computer
glitch, but a speech writer helping the Texas state treasurer was
able to reconstruct the address.
   The computer took the speech, which was about 95 percent
complete, on Tuesday while John Sherman, a speech writer for the
Democratic National Committee, was revising the address.
   Sherman, working from earlier drafts and Ms. Richards' notes,
was able to reconstruct the half-hour address on Wednesday.
   ``I don't trust machines and never have,'' said Ms. Richards,
who finally was able to begin practicing her delivery in
preparation for the Monday night address.

   President Jose Sarney announced
that Brazil has discovered about 100 million barrels worth of oil
in the Atlantic Ocean.
   ``Tests carried out off the coasts of Parana, Sao Paulo and
Santa Catarina states have revealed a 26-square-mile basin with
potential for producing as much as 10,000 barrels a day,'' Sarney
told reporters Wednesday.
   Brazil produces about 600,000 barrels of oil a day.
   In March, Sarney said the state-run oil company, Petrobras,
suspected there were oil deposits in the region but gave no
estimates of the quantities involved.
   According to Sarney, the oil was discovered 112 miles off
Brazil's southern coast at a depth of 390 feet. He also said the
government oil monopoly had found substantial reserves of gas in
the new basin.
   Brazil for decades produced oil only in its northeastern
regions, but in the 1970s major off-shore finds were made off the
coast of Rio de Janeiro state, allowing Brazil to increase its
domestically produced oil supply from 20 percent to 55 percent.
   The country now produces about 60 percent of the oil it consumes.

   More than 200,000 people rallied in the Armenian
capital of Yerevan to demand annexation of an Armenian enclave in
neighboring Azerbaijan, and a strike today paralyzed many of the
city's industries, sources said.
   People took to the streets Wednesday night after learning that
Azerbaijan's government had overridden Nagorno-Karabakh's decision
to secede and join Armenia, Khovik Vasilyan, an Armenian activist
said by telephone from Armenia.
   ``There will be another rally in Yerevan tonight and the
reaction of the Armenian people to Azerbaijan's impudent lie will
become visible,'' said Vasilyan, a former political prisoner.
   In the disputed region itself, a general work stoppage continued
and troops were deployed to maintain calm, said a worker for the
region's party organization.
   ``The people are still not prepared to work'' despite repeated
calls by Communist Party and government leaders to end the nearly
2-month-old strike, said the worker, who spoke by telephone from
Nagorno-Karabakh's main city, Stepanakert.
   In Moscow today, police arrested 15 demonstrators after they
unfurled the Latvian flag and protest banners on the steps of the
Lenin Library.
   One protester held a banner demanding in English, ``Return
Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia.'' Another held a sign that read in
Russian, ``Freedom to Paruyr Ayrikyan,'' an Armenian nationalist
arrested in Yerevan in March.
   Activists in the Baltic republics of Latvia, Estonia and
Lithuania have been pressing for greater autonomy under Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev's reform program.
   The Presidium of Azerbaijan's Supreme Soviet met Tuesday night,
just a few hours after the secession declaration by
Nagorno-Karabakh's legislature, and declared the regional
parliament's decision illegal.
   Soviet media did not announce the ruling until Wednesday.
   Armenians have been agitating for five months for the transfer
of Nagorno-Karabkh to Armenia, resisting authorities in Moscow and
Azerbaijani officials, who oppose any change in the territorial
status of the mountainous region of 160,000 people.
   In February, 32 people died in ethnic rioting in the Azerbaijani
city of Sumgait. Ethnic Armenians are predominantly Christian; most
Azeris are Moslem.
   Rem Ananikyan, deputy director of the official Armenpress news
agency, said by telephone that more than 200,000 people gathered
outside a Yerevan historical institute Wednesday night to call
again for the annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   ``They demanded that this decision be solved, that the strike be
continued,'' Ananikyan said.
   He said Armenians expect the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet,
the highest executive body in the Soviet goverment, to meet Monday
in Moscow to consider the Nagorno-Karabakh question. No such
meeting has been officially announced.
   Participants in Wednesday night's demonstration ``called for a
continuation of the strike until July 18th, that is, until the
meeting of the Presidium,'' Ananikyan said.
   He said the Armenian capital of 1.1 million people was calm this
morning and the subway and other public transportation were working
normally but strikes continued in many of the city's factories.
   Vasilyan said ``basically, the entire republic is not working.''
   The Communist Party daily Pravda reported today that the
widespread work stoppage, which began July 4, has caused $65
million in lost economic production, and construction work worth
$29 million was not carried out.
   The Stepanakert party worker, who refused to give her name, said
troops were deployed in rural areas of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   ``There are troops. They are helping us normalize the
situation,'' she said. ``But it's calm here.''
   She said the troops, which were from the country's internal
forces and not the Red Army, were stationed mostly in ``potentially
dangerous'' places in sparsely populated areas rarely patrolled by
police.
   State-run Radio Moscow reported the work stoppage in the
Delaware-sized region was continuing.
   ``All industrial enterprises in Stepanakert were at a standstill
on Wednesday,'' Radio Moscow said. ``Public and urban transport was
also at a standstill, and shops and services were closed.''
   An employee of the Gostelradio state broadcasting authority in
Stepanakert said Wednesday that enough bread and milk was being
produced locally to meet residents' needs, but that other
foodstuffs were critically short and that food shipments from
Azerbaijan to Nagorno-Karabakh had ceased.
   Radio Moscow also said police were investigating
Nagorno-Karabakh residents who had manufactured or acquired
weapons, but it gave no clue to what the arms might have been
intended for.
   Soviet television reported Wednesday that police in the district
had confiscated dozens of grenades, pistols, revolvers, sawed-off
shotguns and ammunition from residents in the past month.

<TEXT>
   Weather forecasters today were offering
drought-stricken farmers little prospect of relief in separate
outlooks for the next 30 days and three months.
   A new climate assessment of the ongoing drought said ``many
areas now experiencing extreme drought have less than a 4 percent
chance of recovering from the drought within 3 months.''
   The disappointing forecast came as President Reagan headed to
the Midwest to inspect drought-plagued farms.
   On Tuesday the Agriculture Department reported sharp declines in
the outlook for several crops.
   That was followed Wednesday by a 30-day forecast from the
National Weather Service saying that drought-stricken areas from
the Dakotas east to New York and from the Canadian border to
Oklahoma, Arkansas and Tennessee are likely to continue to be short
of rain.
   That area, which includes the major grain-growing states where
crops already are suffering, is given a 55 percent chance of less
than normal rainfall.
   And some states in the center of the area, stretching from West
Virginia to Nebraska and from Wisconsin to Missouri, may be even
drier. They are given a 60 percent chance of being short of
precipitation.
   A slice of southern California, including Los Angeles, is the
driest area in the forecast, with a 70 percent chance of having
below normal rainfall. The rest of coastal California also will be
dry, the forecast said.
   The outlook also says there's a 55 percent chance of hotter than
normal temperatures through the U.S. heartland from New England to
Idaho and from the Canadian border to Oklahoma. Within that area,
the chances of high temperatures are above 65 percent in Wyoming,
while central Midwestern states have a 60 percent chance of above
average temperatures.
   Wetter than normal weather is predicted for west and south
Texas, and parts of New Mexico, Arizona and Utah. Normal
precipitation is forecast for the Atlantic and Gulf coast states,
along with the Northwest and northern Mountain States.
   The Weather Service said normal temperatures are expected for
the Atlantic states from Virginia south, and for the Gulf Coast
states. West Texas and New Mexico may be cooler than normal, but
the far West is expected to see its normal quota of summer heat.
   The separate drought impact assessment, issued by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Office, points out
that predicting an end to the drought is a complex thing, since dry
spells have no normal lifetime. The low 4 percent probability of an
end within 3 months is based simply on a statistical analysis of
past droughts, the agency said.
   The report noted that as of the end of June, 29 percent of the
continental United States was experiencing severe or extreme
drought, with parts of 35 states affected. That puts the current
drought on the same level as the one in 1911, but still less severe
than the droughts of 1936, 1931, 1956 and 1934.

   Mudslides up to a mile long and washouts
have blocked the only highway between Alaska and the lower 48
states, stranding hundreds of travelers in towns and campgrounds,
Canadian highway officials say.
   No injuries were reported.
   The Yukon Territory and northern British Columbia have been
deluged with four to five times their normal rainfall during the
first half of July.
   The largest of the slides started early Wednesday about 40 miles
northwest of Haines Junction, Yukon, more than 200 miles northwest
of Juneau, highway officials said.
   ``It (mud) is about 12 feet high,'' said Yukon highways
supervisor Colin Yuelet. ``There's just over a mile of road that's
under water or mud.''
   Yuelet said mud and boulders as big as bulldozers slid from a
mountainside across the road and into the south end of Kluane Lake.
   Smaller slides and washouts blocked a 43-mile stretch of the
Alaska Highway near Muncho Lake in northern British Columbia, said
Jim Coxford of the Canadian Public Works Department in Whitehorse.
   If the rain continues, clearing the Kluane Lake slide could take
up to a week, said Yeulet. He borrowed two bulldozers from a road
construction company to handle the project.
   Travelers caught between the two areas of slides holed up in the
Yukon capital of Whitehorse, about 90 miles southeast of Haines
Junction, or were directed to take a much longer route into Alaska
through Dawson, Yukon.
   On the northwest side of the slide, Canadian customs officials
advised tourists entering the Yukon from Alaska to take the longer
route or to wait out the slide in about a dozen lodges between the
border and the roadblock.
   As many as 400 vehicles cross the border daily. Last July,
Canadian customs counted 33,512 people driving the highway from
Alaska into the Yukon.
   ``We are as busy as busy can be because the road is now blocked
to the north and south of us,'' said Jack Austad, weigh scale
operator in Whitehorse. ``We've had nothing but people asking
questions here all day.''
   In Haines Junction, town manager Joanne Feenstra said she was
getting ready to open the community hall to travelers.
   Jim Steele of the Whitehorse weather station said he drove
through the Muncho area Tuesday, dodging small slides and big
puddles.
   ``It was like driving in a lake,'' he said.

   Police arrested a dissident journalist and 14
other demonstrators today after they unfurled the Latvian flag and
several protest banners near the Kremlin.
   ``We have the right to speak out. That is what democracy is,'' a
Latvian demonstrator told a police officer who ordered the group to
disperse. ``Is this glasnost?'' asked the man, referring to Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of open debate.
   The man then opened Latvia's red and white flag. A plainclothes
officer immediately ripped the flag from the man's arms and dragged
him to a bus.
   Other officers grabbed the rest of the demonstrators who had
gathered in pouring rain on the steps of the Lenin Library _ within
sight of the Kremlin _ and hauled them onto the yellow bus.
   The fate of those arrested was not immediately clear.
   One demonstrator who apparently managed to elude arrest, Andrei
Shilkov, telephoned The Associated Press and said the protesters
were held at a Moscow militia post. Shilkov is a correspondent for
the unofficial magazine ``Glasnost.''
   A worker at the post told the AP by phone the demonstrators had
not been arrested and then hung up the phone.
   The Latvian man was wearing a T-shirt referring to the 1941
deportation of tens of thousands of Baltic residents whom dictator
Josef Stalin accused of being Nazi sympathizers. The Soviet Union
annexed the Baltic nations of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania in 1940
under a secret agreement with Nazi Germany.
   The journalist, Sergei I. Grigoryants, whom Gorbachev condemned
in a May interview as a ``parasite'' ``sponging on the democratic
process,'' managed to elude officers for a few minutes. But after
handing reporters a statement about the protest, he too was
arrested.
   The demonstrators also included representatives of informal
political groups from Estonia and Lithuania. Also present were
Ukrainian human rights activists.
   One protester held a banner demanding in English, ``Return
Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia.'' Another held a sign that read in
Russian, ``Freedom to Paruyr Ayrikyan,'' an Armenian nationalist
arrested in the republic's capital, Yerevan, in March.
   Armenians have been campaigning since February for transfer of
the mostly Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh region from the republic of
Azerbaijan to Armenia.
   Grigoryants, 47, has become one of the Soviet Union's most
prominent political activists.
   After spending four years in prison for underground writings, he
was released in February 1987 under a general amnesty. Since then,
he has taken advantage of Gorbachev's openness policy to produce a
magazine called ``Glasnost.''
   On May 9, however, he and four other people were arrested
outside the house they were using as an office for the magazine. He
spent seven days in jail on a conviction of disobeying a police
officer.
   Andrei Shilkov, 36, another member of the ``Glasnost'' magazine
staff, was arrested today.

   A helicopter ferrying Hindu pilgrims to
a cave temple in northern Kashmir state crashed today, and all
seven people on board were killed, Indian news agencies reported.
   Among the victims were the two crew members of the
state-operated helicopter service, the United News of India and
Press Trust of India reported.
   The pilgrims were on their way to Vaishno Devi, a temple in the
Himalayas dedicated to three mother Goddesses of Hinduism, the

shrine, which is 280 miles north of New Delhi.
   The cause of the crash was not immediately known.

   An apartment building described by neighbors as a
crack house was firebombed today, and at least four people were
killed and six injured, police and fire officials said.
   ``All the witnesses that were interviewed have indicated there
was a firebombing,'' said a police arson inspector who declined
identification.
   A homicide officer who refused to give his name said at least
four people were killed. The victims could not immediately be
identified. ``We don't even know their sex,'' he said.
   No arrests were made, the arson inspector said, adding that the
bodies of other victims might be found in the ruins.
   Six people, including two who jumped from the second floor, were
taken to Detroit Receiving Hospital, the homicide officer said.
Their conditions were not immediately known.
   The blaze, reported at 3:16 a.m., was brought under control more
than four hours later, said a Fire Department dispatcher who also
declined to be identified.
   Otto Cureton, who lived next door, said he heard glass breaking,
went outside and saw five men running away. ``I thought they were
trying to break into my house,'' he said. ``I didn't even know it
was a fire.''
   Cureton and Doretha Thompson, who also lived next door,
speculated that the fire was set by rival crack dealers.
   ``The police had to come here a number of times,'' said Ms.
Thompson, 35, who with her two daughters escaped injury. ``They did
their business right outside.''
   The wood-frame duplex in which Cureton and Thompson lived also
was burned out.

<TEXT>
   The only obstetrician-gynecologist in
two rural counties died while performing a hysterectomy, and
another doctor had to fly 40 miles from Montgomery to complete the
operation.
   Dr. Robert X. Williams, 54, suffered a heart attack Wednesday
and was pronounced dead in the operating room of Bullock County
Hospital, officials said.
   A helicopter from St. Margaret's Hospital flew in Dr. Judi
Jehle, who successfully completed the surgery, said Don Priori,
chairman of the Bullock County Hospital Board.
   Williams' death leaves Bullock and Macon counties without an
obstetrician-gynecologist. The two counties in southeastern Alabama
are among the poorest in the state and have high infant-mortality
rates.
   ``As far as OB delivery goes, it will close us up,'' Priori said.
   Williams delivered between 60 and 80 babies a month, he said.
``That's a pretty heavy delivery load for one doctor,'' Priori
said. ``He had more than two a day.''
   Priori said a search has begun to try to find a replacement
physician.
   After Williams' death Wednesday, two women who had gone into
labor were rushed to Baptist Medical Center in Montgomery.
   ``We're worried about the women who are real close to
delivery,'' Priori said. ``The two we sent to Baptist hospital in
Montgomery by ambulance were already having contractions. We're
watching several others now. We have the ambulance standing by.''
   Bullock County's infant mortality rate in 1987 was 21.5 deaths
per 1,000 births, according to state health officials. The state
average was 12.2.

   A helicopter carrying 16 people from an oil
rig crashed in the Gulf of Mexico today, injuring 15 and leaving
one person missing, the Coast Guard said.
   The Puma aircraft operated by Petroleum Helicopters Inc. went
down around 7:30 a.m. about 100 miles southeast of here, said Coast
Guard Lt. Bruce Campbell.
   A boat picked up 15 of the people aboard, Campbell said. One was
seriously injured and the others sustained minor injuries and were
taken to hospitals in Lafayette and Abbeville, La., he said.
   ``There is one person still missing. He was last seen in the
helicopter, but we don't have any information after that,''
Campbell said. ``We're searching for him as well as a number of PHI
and other commercial helicopters.''
   Campbell said the helicopter was carrying two pilots and 14 crew
members after a shift change from a Forest Oil Co. oil rig.
Campbell said the helicopter probably was en route to Morgan City,
Intracoastal City or Cameron.

<TEXT>
   The American Civil Liberties Union is
challenging an ordinance requiring people to obtain a permit from
the police chief before they can move in or out of the city.
   The ACLU is defending Lenna Palmer, who is accused of violating
the municipal code by moving out of East Orange, an urban,
blue-collar community of 77,000 outside Newark. Palmer received a
summons in May.
   ``The city has a right to know when people move in and out of
its town,'' said city Clerk Earl Williams. He said said the purpose
of the ordinance is to allow officials to find people who owe the
city money.
   But Eric Neisser, legal director of the state ACLU, said the
``basic right of all people in this country is to travel and move
around, obviously in states and between states, and this ordinance
restricts that right.''
   ``It affects privacy primarily because the ordinance says you
have to file an application telling them where you're moving to,''
Neisser said.
   At a hearing today, Municipal Judge Ernest Booker postponed the
case until Aug. 17 after city attorneys said they needed more time
to study the issues.
   The judge also told both sides to submit arguments explaining
why issues of constitutionality should be decided by a municipal
court.
   Police Chief George Daher was out of town and could not be
reached for comment Wednesday, officials said.
   The city's attorneys declined to comment outside court today.
   The ordinance requires a person to file with the chief a $2
application listing the person's old and new address, the date of
the move and how the person's property will be transported.
   Moving is prohibited after sundown or on Sundays and violators
are subject to a $500 fine and 90 days in jail.
   Marianne Tolomeo, an ACLU attorney defending Ms. Palmer, said
the U.S. Supreme Court has held that there is a constitutional
right to travel and struck down a Nevada law that levied a $1 tax
on everyone leaving the state.
   Ms. Palmer now lives in a neighboring community.

<HEAD>Three Children Drown When Wake From Tugboat Knocks Them Down in
River</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three children who drowned when a tugboat's
wake apparently knocked them off their feet had been warned by
their parents or grandparents to stay away from the river, the
coroner said today.
   The three were wading in the Tennessee-Tombigbee River with two
other children Wednesday morning, said police spokesman Willie
Williams.
   He identified the dead as Sherea Blanks, 9, and Andrea Nettles,
10, both of Jackson, and Kevin Scruggs, 10, of Detroit, who was
visiting his grandparents.
   A 10-year-old and a 9-year-old escaped unharmed.
   Alabama Electric Cooperative workers on the other side of the
river saw the children go under and called police, said Clarke
County Coroner Wayne Lathan.
   ``The river is not that deep where they were but the kids were
not that big,'' Lathan said. ``Apparently the wake from the tug
must have knocked them off their feet.''
   He said although the children had been warned not to go to the
river, ``they slipped off and went down there anyway.''
   Swimming in the river is not prohibited, but Lathan said the
children were near a bend unsafe for swimmers because of the wake
from river traffic.

<TEXT>
   The leftist Sandinista government has
nationalized the nation's largest and oldest private enterprise in
what the opposition calls the latest in a series of repressive
moves.
   The Agrarian Reform Ministry announced the takeover of the San
Antonio sugar refinery on Wednesday. It said the owners hadn't
invested in the company since 1981, hurting sales, dollar income
and working conditions.
   The move leaves nearly the entire sugar industry in the hands of
the government, which has virtually no money to pay compensation.
The San Antonio mill had become a symbol of private enterprise,
which the opposition favors over socialism.
   The crackdown by the Sandinistas, who in recent months appeared
to be easing controls on society, began Sunday when police used
tear gas to break up an authorized opposition march.
   They beat and arrested several dozen of the 10,000 demontrators.
   The crackdown appears a reaction to continued attacks by
U.S.-backed Contra rebels, the appearance of U.S. Embassy personnel
at Sundays march, increasing domestic dissent and pressure from
hardline Sandinista leaders.
   With the economic crisis deepening, opposition groups seem
stronger and more united than ever.
   On Monday, the Foreign Ministry ordered the expulsion of U.S.
Ambassador Richard Melton and seven other embassy diplomats.
   The Sandinistas charged that the U.S. Embassy supported Sunday's
march as part of a plan to destabilize the government by creating
an internal front.
   At the same time, the Sandinistas closed the Roman Catholic
radio station indefinitely and suspended for 15 days the
publication of the only opposition newspaper, La Prensa.
   The press restrictions mean neither can cover ceremonies next
Tuesday celebarting the ninth anniversary of the revolution that
ousted President Anastasio Somoza or the ``hunger march'' an
opposition group plans for July 24.
   Since August, the Sandinistas had loosened the reins to comply
with a regional peace plan, restoring many liberties taken away
during the nearly 7-year-old war with the Contras.
   La Prensa was permitted to reopen after being shut 15 months and
to publish without censorship for the first time in five years.
   The moves paid off when in February, Congress rejected President
Reagan's request for continued military aid to the Contras.
   But hardline Sandinistas, including Interior Minister Tomas
Borge, reportedly objected to the concessions. Borge controls the
media and the police.
   In March, the Sandinistas began peace talks with the Contras and
on March 23 a temporary cease-fire agreement was signed. A series
of meetings since has failed to produce any concrete results.
   Talks broke off June 9, but the Sandinistas have twice
unilaterally renewed temporary truces. Over the past week, they
have reported daily Contra attacks.
   The latest bulletin by the Defense Ministry said one civilian
was killed and six wounded Wednesday when a Tranportation Ministry
truck ran over a mine about 95 miles northeast of Managua.
   The Foreign Ministry sent a note to U.S. Secretary of State
George P. Shultz protesting the incident.
   The expropriation of the sugar mill appears to contradict
earlier statements by President Daniel Ortega.
   In mid-June, Ortega announced the latest in moves designed to
revive the economy. The government says the war has caused $3.6
billion in damage, and annual inflation runs well over 1,000
percent.
   Ortega said the government needs to move away from Marxist
economic measures and lean toward capitalism. He said monetary
rather than moral incentives should bolster production.
   But most sectors balked, and the Sandinistas ended up agreeing
to provide a small amount of beans, rice and sugar to workers in
non-productive areas, such as doctors, teachers and soldiers.
   The San Antonio sugar refinery confiscated on Wednesday was
described as ``the last of a mixed economy in Nicaragua'' by
Gilberto Cuadra, the vice president of the anti-government Private
Enterprise Council.

   Two types of toy carts imported from Taiwan
are being recalled because they could pose a choking hazard, the
Consumer Product Safety Commission announced today.
   Labeled ``Musical Car ST-22 (A or B) Made in Taiwan,'' the toys
came in both wind-up and battery-powered models and sold for about
$2.50 each, according to the importer, Li Peng Enterprises of Los
Angeles.
   The toys consist of a panda pushing another panda in a
four-wheel cart. Each cart has an umbrella with plastic balls and
disks hanging from it. These items can come off and present a
choking hazard for small children, the safety commission said.
   Parents should take the toy away from children and either
discard it or return it to the retailer for a refund, the agency
said. About 4,800 of the wind-up versions and 3,600 battery-powered
toys were sold between November 1987 and January of this year,
officials said.
   People needing more information can contact the safety
commission at 1-800-638-2772.

<TEXT>
   The judge in the case of an ex-CIA agent
accused of conspiring to illegally ship arms to Nicaraguan rebels
today rejected a defense objection to pre-trial procedures for
handling classified documents.
   U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. approved security
rules proposed by prosecutors to govern the handling of thousands
of pages of classified documents that were gathered by prosecutors
in the case.
   A defense attorney for Joseph F. Fernandez, the CIA's former
station chief in Costa Rica, argued that the order contained so
many restrictions on the use of classified documents by the defense
team ``as to be constitutionally faulty.''
   ``This is a completely unprecedented case, in terms of the
defendant and the nature of the indictment and the nature of the
information that will be needed'' to defend the charges, said
defense lawyer Thomas E. Wilson.
   Robinson approved the protective order proposed by prosecutors
on the staff of independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh but said he
would be willing to make changes if the defense found the rules
unworkable.
   The order restricts the use of classified documents to a secure
facility that is supervised by a court security officer. Witnesses
whom defense lawyers want to show documents must sign pledges not
to reveal the information to others.
   Robinson granted Wilson's request that the names of people
signing such pledges not be shown to prosecutors. ``You don't need
to know that,'' the judge told Hassler.
   The judge scheduled an Aug. 15 hearing to consider Fernandez's
challenge to the constitutionality of the Classified Information
Procedures Act as it applies to his case.
   The statute requires defendants to notify the government of
specific government secrets they plan to divulge during the trial
to defend criminal charges.
   The defense contends that the requirement tramples on
Fernandez's right to a fair trial because the case involves at
least 60,000 secret documents as well as witnesses whose very
identity is still classified.
   Wilson argued in court papers filed Wednesday that prosecutors
would be tipped to the defense strategy if told in advance of the
secrets he planned to divulge.
   ``Testimony of virtually every government witness (and the vast
majority of likely defense witnesses) will inevitably contain a
great deal of classified information,'' the defense brief said.
   ``Even the identity of many of the witnesses in the case _
witnesses for both the government and the defense _ will be
classified,'' Fernandez's lawyer said.
   Wilson noted that Fernandez's testimony to congressional
committees investigating the Iran-Contra affair was given in closed
sessions and released only after numerous references to classified
information were deleted.
   Fernandez, who operated in Central America under the pseudonym
of Tomas Castillo, is charged with conspiring to operate an illegal
arms-supply network to the Nicaraguan rebels in defiance of a
congressional ban on such military assistance.
   He also is accused of lying to his CIA superiors as well as to
the presidential commission headed by former Sen. John Tower,
R-Texas, that investigated the Iran-Contra affair.
   His constitutional challenge is similar to one mounted by fired
White House aide Oliver L. North, former national security adviser
John M. Poindexter, and arms dealers Albert Hakim and retired Air
Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord.
   The four are charged with conspiring to illegally divert
U.S.-Iran arms-sales profits to the Contras.
   In that case, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell denied a
defense motion to declare the statute unconstitutional. Gesell has
ordered four separate trials and scheduled North's for Sept. 20.
   On Wednesday, Gesell also scheduled closed hearings on Aug. 8
and Aug. 22 to consider North's proposals to use secret documents
at his trial.

<TEXT>
   A 73-year-old federal judge apologized today
for outlawing the courtesy title Ms. in his courtroom and
interrupting a race discrimination trial to scold an attorney for
using her maiden name.
   ``I unfortunately lost my temper,'' Senior U.S. District Judge
Hubert I. Teitelbaum said in a statement.
   ``I have always referred to married women by their married name.
This is the way my generation was taught,'' he said. ``I recognize
your right to be addressed in any manner in which you see fit, and
I apologize for my comment and the resulting situation.'
   Teitelbaum directed his apology to Barbara Wolvovitz, whom he
told on Friday, ``From here on, in this courtroom you will use Mrs.
Lobel. That's your name.'' She is the wife of University of
Pittsburgh law professor Jules Lobel.
   The judge originally threatened the lawyer with jail when she
resisted, and when her co-counsel, Jon Pushinsky, came to her
defense, Teitelbaum found him in contempt for ``officious
intermeddling'' and gave him a suspended 30-day jail sentence.
   Ms. Wolvovitz on Monday asked for mistrial, which Teitelbaum
rejected, adding, ``What if I call you sweetie?'' He then settled
on calling her ``counselor.''
   In his apology, Teitelbaum said he would grant a mistrial if the
defense requested one again before the jury returned with a verdict.
   During a disjointed dialogue Friday that covered about 20 pages
of court transcript, Teitelbaum told Ms. Wolvovitz that Mrs. Lobel
is her legal name ``under the laws of the state of Pennsylvania.''
   ``And that's what I want you to be, to call yourself from here
on in this courtroom,'' he said. ``That's an intolerable kind of
thing.''
   The judge claimed a married woman must petition Common Pleas
Court for permission to use her maiden name. However, the
Pennsylvania Family Law Practice and Procedure Handbook said no
legal proceedings are required.
   Teitelbaum, presiding over a race discrimination suit against
PPG Industries Inc., also asked each of the six female jurors
Friday if she used her husband's name or maiden name. All used
their husbands' names.
   The trial began June 23, but the issue of ``Ms.'' in
Teitelbaum's court never surfaced before Friday.
   The case went to the jury Wednesday. Ms. Wolvovitz said she
would not decide whether to file a complaint against the judge
until after the jury delivers its verdict.
   Teitelbaum, 73, a former U.S. attorney appointed to the federal
bench by President Nixon in 1970, declined to comment Wednesday to
The Associated Press.
   According to the American Bar Association, Ms. Wolvovitz could
file a complaint with the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in
Philadelphia, which could decide to publicly or privately admonish
the judge, said Ernest Zavodnyk, with the Chicago-based judicial
administration division.
   Ms. Wolvovitz, 36, said she was ``in shock for two days.''
   ``I've practiced for 10 years. I've gotten into arguments with
judges but never over something like this. I can't quite understand
what happened,'' said Ms. Wolvovitz, who had never argued a case
before Teitelbaum. ``After it was over and the jury left, I had
tears in my eyes.''
   ``We didn't know what to do. She started crying. I started
crying,'' said Ms. Wolvovitz's client, Charles Gavin.
   Teitelbaum retreated Monday on his threat to jail Pushinsky,
saying, ``Did you really think you were going to jail?''
   When Pushinsky said he didn't ``draw any conclusions,''
Teitelbaum said, ``I just thought over the weekend I'd let you
think about it.''
   ``I never thought he was such a Neanderthal,'' said National
Organization for Women President Molly Yard, a Pittsburgh resident
who is familiar with Teitelbaum. ``I can't understand how anybody
who's bright enough to be on federal court can make such an error
in judgment.''

<HEAD>Conair ``Wave Maker'' Curling Iron Recalled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three models of the ``Wave Maker'' curling
irons by Conair are being recalled because of a possible burn
hazard, the Consumer Product Safety Commission announced today.
   The agency said the 1987 models CD 20M, CD 21M and CD 22M may,
under certain conditions, short circuit and pose a burn or fire
hazard.
   Only about 5,000 of the approximately 76,000 units sold pose the
problem, the agency said. However, 82 incidents have been reported
of the line cord shorting or igniting. About 20 cases involved
minor burns to users, officials said.
   The curling irons have mauve handles, silver barrel and white
plastic tip. They carry the model number and the following date
codes: 01 87E, 02 87E, 03 87E, 04 87E, 05 87E, 04-87 and 05-87.
   Owners of the irons should stop using them, tag the unit with
their name and address and mail it to Conair Corporation-Wave
Makers, 11 Executive Avenue, Edison, N.J. 08817. The company will
repair or replace the irons and reimburse the customer for postage.
Customers may also return the irons to the retailer where purchased
for a refund.
   Some of the Wave Makers were repaired before going on sale, and

   Two women told Congress today they have
suffered permanent health damage as a result of exposure to
chemical products used in beauty salons.
   Edith Khatami said she has a central nervous disorder called
cognitive dysfunction as well as occupational asthma caused by
handling chemicals that contain methylene chloride at a wig salon
in Cupertino, Calif.
   ``I can't remember things that I did just a short while ago,''
Mrs. Khatami said. ``That's one of the health effects of the
neurotoxins I was exposed to,'' said the woman who styled wigs for
four years until 1985.
   Mrs. Khatami and Kristie Smith, 24, of Portland, Ore., appeared
before a House small business committee which is investigating
regulation of the cosmetics industry, a $17-billion-a-year business.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the chairman, said the Food and Drug
Administration does not test cosmetics for safety as it does food
and drugs. Moreover, the FDA does not have the authority to require
that the manufacturers prove the safety of their products before
they are marketed.
   ``These regulatory gaps raise serious questions about the Food
and Drug Administration's ability to effectively oversee this
booming industry,'' he said.
   Wyden said cosmetic ingredients may ``cause cancer, birth
defects, central nervous system disorders, allergic reactions and
have long-term health effects.''
   Wyden said nearly 8,000 chemicals are used in cosmetics and
fragrances. Products on the market combine those chemicals in as
many as 20,000 and 40,000 combinations.
   FDA spokesman Emil Corwin was not immediately available to
provide a response, his secretary said.
   Ms. Smith said she never suffered from asthma until she was
exposed to chemicals used on patrons' hair at a beauty school four
years ago. Today, she said she has a lung condition so bad that a
whiff of perfume can trigger a breathing attack.
   ``What I am really angry about is that no one told me _ or
anyone else in my school _ that the chemicals we were using might
be dangerous,'' Ms. Smith said.
   She said she encountered trouble breathing within months of
enrolling in the beauty school where she routinely gave women
permanent waves and used other chemical compounds. She was
diagnosed as having occupational asthma 10 months after starting
school.
   She said she sued the school and received a $12,000 settlement.
She is now a bartender.
   Beth Shulman, vice president of the United Food and Commercial
Workers International Union, said members of the union who work in
salons and beauty schools are worried about the chemicals contained
in the products they handle.
   ``These products may seem benign because of their attractive
packaging and fragrances, but the chemical ingredients in them are
not,'' she said.
   She said the committee's task _ to determine if the American
public is protected from hazardous chemicals in cosmetics _ is an
``urgent one.``

   The smallest human ever to receive a liver
transplant died this morning, two days after he and another baby
became the first Americans to receive divided parts of a single
donor organ, a hospital spokesman said.
   The other youngster, 7-month old Jaclyn Manrose of Crystal Lake,
Ill., was in critical and stable condition but ``doing very well,''
the spokesman said.
   ``Twelve-week-old Joseph Kovach died today at 8:30 a.m. from
heart failure at Wyler Children's Hospital,'' said John Easton, a
spokesman for the hospital.
   ``He had a major birth defect involving the heart,'' Easton said
of the Geneva, Ill., boy. ``Shortly after the transplant, the
infant suffered a brief cardiac arrest, which was attributed to
weakened heart and the stress of major surgery.''
   The shock of the episode caused his kidneys to fail and his
impaired his breathing, the spokesman said.
   The youngsters were participants in the first double liver
transplant ever performed in the United States, receiving the
divided liver of a 1-year-old Illinois child who had died in an
accident, the university said.
   Weighing only 4.2 pounds, Joseph was the smallest human ever to
get a liver transplant, Easton said.
   ``Because of his small size and additional medical problems,
Joseph Kovach was a high-risk transplant candidate,'' said Dr.
Peter Whitington, associate professor of pediatrics and the
physician in charge of Joseph's care.
   ``But because of his advanced liver disease, he urgently needed
a transplant to have a chance at survival,'' Whitington added in a
statement.
   Tuesday's operation lasted 12 hours. Double liver transplants
involving adult donors have been performed in Europe, but such an
operation has not been done in the United States, Easton said.
   Donor livers are in short supply in this country. An estimated
475 people are awaiting liver transplants, many of them children
who will die without new organs.
   Joseph was born with neonatal cirrhosis, a type of liver damage
that exists at birth from an unknown cause, the spokesman said.
   Jaclyn suffered from a hereditary defect called
alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency,a deficiency of an enzyme that can
lead to hepatitis or cirrhosis, the spokesman said.
   ``Kovach was the more urgent of the two,'' he said. The
operation was performed by Dr. Christoff Broelsch, professor of
surgery and head of liver transplantation at the university.
   Dr. Jean Emond, assistant professor of surgery, operated on the
Manrose infant, Easton said.
   ``During the early stages of that, Broelsch separated the
liver,'' Easton said. ``While Emond was completing his operation,
Broelsch did the transplant on Kovach.''
   At a news conference Wednesday, the girl's parents said they had
no qualms about approving the experimental surgery for their
daughter, who has a 5-year-old brother and a twin sister. They were
just glad a donor organ was available.
   ``Megan (the twin) wants her sister back,'' said mother Kathleen
Manrose, whose husband, Bob, is a maintenance specialist with
United Airlines.
   Joseph's parents, Patty and Donald Kovach, a comptroller for a
Chicago firm, did not attend the news conference because their son
was back in surgery.
   Two infants younger than Joseph have received new livers at the
University of Pittsburgh's transplant center, but both weighed more
than 6 pounds, Easton said.

   All 14 trucks and a bus in the Veterans'
Peace Convoy carrying supplies to Nicaragua have crossed the border
into Mexico despite earlier U.S. efforts to block the group's
journey, a spokesman said today.
   The vehicles that arrived at this Texas-Mexico border city
Friday crossed the Rio Grande without incident. Among them were
three vehicles that had earlier been stopped and towed away on
Saturday, said spokesman Raul Valdez.
   ``The same vehicles that got stopped Saturday ... paid 75 cents
and got across,'' said Valdez.
   He said the 15 vehicles were clearly marked ``Veterans Peace
Convoy'' or displayed similar slogans. One truck has been shuttling
people back and forth across the border, he said.
   He said the group is puzzled why American authorities stopped
trying to block the convoy.
   Customs officials had prevented the trucks from crossing the
border at least three times, contending that taking the vehicles to
Nicaragua would violate a 3-year-old trade embargo against that
country.
   Customs Service spokeswoman Donna De La Torre in Houston said
today the agency has not changed its policy.
   ``Three vehicles did cross yesterday but they declared their
intent to go to Mexico only. It is not against the law to go to
Mexico. A fourth vehicle also approached and the driver said he was
going to Nicaragua, but he was not allowed to cross,'' she said.
   ``I am aware of reports that other vehicles have crossed since
then,'' she said. ``But they have crossed without the knowledge and
approval of the U.S. Customs Service. Without advance notice of
export activity, the Customs Service does not staff southbound
lanes. I would not be surprised that some vehicles had mingled with
legitimate traffic and crossed.''
   Texas Rural Legal Aid lawyer William Beardall told a federal
judge Wednesday that 10 convoy vehicles had crossed without
incident. His comments came during a hearing on a lawsuit convoy
members filed against the government to try to win approval to take
the vehicles, which are loaded with food and medical supplies, to
Nicaragua.
   Convoy members oppose U.S. government policies in Nicaragua,
including the embargo and U.S. support for Contra rebels fighting
the leftist Sandinista government. The group is also sending about
300 tons of aid by ship.
   ``A vehicle can also be used to commit an act of terrorism,''
Justice Department attorney John Tyler said at Wednesday's hearing.
   The government's position is that the food and medical supplies
qualify as humanitarian aid exempt from the embargo but that the
vehicles do not constitute humanitarian aid.
   Convoy members have refused to sign forms promising they will
return the vehicles within 30 days.
   U.S. District Judge George P. Kazen gave both sides until July
21 to file briefs in the case.
   The convoy first tried to cross the U.S. border June 15, and
Customs officials temporarily detained four trucks.
   On Saturday, police arrested eight convoy members when they
refused to leave the road leading to a toll booth at a Rio Grande
bridge. One of the eight was arrested again Monday when he tried to
drive across again.
   Violating the embargo could mean 10 years in prison and fines up
to $50,000, Conroy said.

<TEXT>
   The last of three men awaiting retrial in
the 1973 slayings of six members of a farm family pleaded guilty
today and was sentenced to life in prison.
   George Elder Dungee, 50, pleaed guilty to six counts of murder.
He was to have been retried later this year. His 1974 conviction
had been overturned by a federal appeals court on grounds that
pre-trial publicity prevented a fair trial.
   Muscogee County Superior Court Judge Hugh Lawson sentenced
Dungee to three consecutive life terms and three concurrent life
terms.
   ``This is the sentence we had hoped to get to avoid the death
penalty,'' said defense attorney Stephen Bright.
   Seminole County District Attorney Charles Ferguson had announced
this week he would not seek the death penalty against Dungee
because of a new Georgia law prohibiting execution of the mentally
retarded.
   Court-ordered tests, he said, found Dungee ``significantly
sub-average'' in intelligence.
   Dungee, Carl Isaacs and Wayne Coleman were convicted and
sentenced to die for murdering six members of the Ned Alday family
during a robbery at the Alday farm near Donalsonville in Seminole
County.
   The three escapees from a Maryland prison killed five Alday men,
shooting them at close range in a mobile home, then raped and shot
a woman in a field nearby. Their convictions were overturned in
1985.
   Isaacs was convicted earlier this year in a retrial in Houston
County and was again sentenced to death. Coleman was convicted in
DeKalb County but avoided the death penalty when the jury
deadlocked over the sentence.
   Bright said Dungee has an IQ of 64-69.
   ``His involvement was by far the least of any of those
involved,'' Bright said. ``There's no doubt his mental limitations
had something to do with it.''

   The governing council of International Civil
Aviation Organization today agreed that the world body should
investigate the U.S. downing of an Iranian jetliner, but it refused
to condemn the United States for the incident.
   Iran wanted the ICAO to condemn the United States for the
missile attack July 3 that killed 290 people. Only four of the
council's 33 member nations, the Soviet Union, China,
Czechoslovakia, and Cuba, spoke in favor of condemnation.
   There was no formal vote either on a condemnation or on the
investigation.
   No one spoke in dissent of Iran's call for an independent ICAO
investigation of the disaster.
   After today's meeting, ICAO President Dr. Assad Kotaite called a
recess in the special two-day session so members could hold private
consulations.
   The only time the ICAO has condemned a nation in a formal
resolution was in 1973, when it criticized Israel for attacking
Lebanese civilian aircraft, ICAO officials said.
   Chinese delegate Li Keli called for a ``full and impartial
investigation.'' ``We condemn this action,,'' he said of the
missile attack. ``The Chinese government is opposed to big power
military involvement in the gulf region.''
   The United States offered its defense Wednesday.
   ``Iranian vessels were attacking U.S. naval vessels at the very
moment that Iran Air 655 took off from Bandar Abbas,'' U.S.
assistant Secretary of State Richard S. Williamson said in a
15-page defense at the opening meeting.
   ``The plane headed straight for the scene of the conflict and
failed to heed, or even answer, the repeated warnings and requests
for identification.
   ``Some degree of responsibility must be taken by Iran for
putting its aircraft in this vulnerable position,'' Williamson
argued.
   He said the captain of the USS Vincennes, which the Pentagon
says mistook the Iranian airliner for an F-14 fighter, had just
four minutes to react and that fair-minded people would find the
captain's decision reasonable in the circumstances.
   Williamson blamed Iran for not heeding a U.N. Security Council
resolution calling for a cease-fire the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war.
   He said U.S. forces are in the gulf only to protect naval and
air traffic, which he termed a ``major victim'' of the war.
   Iranian spokesman Hassan Shafty said the Iran Air Airbus A300
was exactly where it was scheduled to be when it was shot down _
ascending from Bandar Abbas on a 28-minute scheduled flight to
Dubai.
   Later, in answer to a Soviet question, Williamson said the
Vincennes was aware there were scheduled flights in the area.
   Iran asked the ICAO council to form a fact-finding team and
recommend means of preventing a recurrence.
   It also sought ``explicit condemnation'' of the United States
for using weapons against a civilian airliner, and demanded the end
of ``obstacles, restrictions, threats and use of force'' against
Iranian air space.
   The United States called for minimum altitude requirements,
unambiguous radar signals and better radio communications to ensure
that warnings to pilots are received.
   West Germany and Brazil were among countries urging ICAO to
review provisions for coordinating military and civilian air
traffic control.
   After a majority of council members had spoken Wednesday, it was
clear there was little support for political attacks on the United
States.
   U.S. permanent representative Edmund Stohr said Washington has
many allies in the ICAO who appreciate the way U.S. patrols have
kept oil flowing from the Persian Gulf.
   The Soviet delegate, Ivan Vasin, read a government statement
issued last week saying the tragedy ``was far from accidental.'' He
termed the attack ``a grievous international offense for which the
United States bears full responsibility.''
   But Soviet emphasis was on the future, suggesting that a United
Nations naval force replace the U.S. fleet in the gulf and echoing
Williamson's call for immediate action to reroute civilian air
traffic away from gulf hot spots.
   Several speakers urged more countries to ratify a 1984 ICAO
protocol banning the use of force against civilian aircraft. Only
48 of ICAO's 159 member nations have ratified the amendment.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old Californian, the youngest pilot to
fly the Atlantic, stepped from the cockpit Thursday with a huge
grin on his freckled face. He was greeted by champagne toasts and a
proud but worried mother.
   ``We're finally here. We made it,'' said Christopher Lee
Marshall, weary but beaming, as he stood on the wing of his
single-engine Mooney 252 aircraft at Le Bourget, the same airfield
where Charles Lindbergh completed the first solo transatlantic
flight in 1927.
   ``Mommy missed you so much. Give me a kiss,'' said his mother,
Gail Marshall of Oceana, Calif., who waved an American flag and
handed Christopher a new stuffed bear.
   His old stuffed bear Charles Lindbeargh, cuddly and blue with
aviator's helmet and goggles, accompanied him on the long flight.
   ``Charles Lindbergh was one of my heroes,'' the young aviator
told reporters. ``So we decided on this trip, then next year
hopefully around the world.''
   He still wore his bright blue flight suit, with a baseball cap
reading ``Chris Marshall Tour'' covering his straw-colored hair, as
he sipped cola at a champagne and soft-drink reception inside an
airport hangar.
   Unlike Lindbergh, Christopher made several stops between New
York and Paris _ in Canada, Greenland, Iceland and Scotland _ and
had company and emergency help from retired Navy pilot Randy
Cunningham, 46. Their trip started in San Diego on July 7.
   ``I didn't want to take an 11-year-old boy and make him fly for
20 hours straight,'' Cunningham said. ``I had a hard enough time
having him fly eight hours a day and keeping him awake. You know an
11-year-old boy wants to go to sleep when he gets tired.''
   Christopher's mother and friends who helped plan the trip said
they did not know who the previous youngest pilot to fly the
Atlantic might have been, but they were confident no one younger
had done it.
   Cunningham said the youngster, who will enter fifth grade this
fall, is ``a very talented pilot. He flies better than some of the
adults I've flown with.''
   He first went into a cockpit when he was 4 years old _ with his
father, an airline pilot _ and began flying with an instructor when
he was 7.
   Last year he became the youngest pilot to fly across the United
States, but the record already has been broken. Christopher said he
was glad even younger kids have followed his example.
   ``I'm an ambassador to the youth of America, and I'm showing all
kids across America that they can go out and accomplish their
dreams,'' he said.
   The scariest moment of the flight came early Wednesday, when the
plane's oil pressure fell and its engine began overheating in bad
weather between Greenland and Reykjavik, Iceland.
   Cunningham took the controls for the return to the southeast
coast of Greenland and had to pick his way through mountains to a
small airfield at Kulusuk, where clouds were just 100 feet off the
ground.
   ``Only one of a million pilots could have made that landing and
he did,'' Christopher said. ``We came so close to dying.''
   ``I didn't think we'd make it through. We had to fly at 50 feet
off the ground, because there were mountains and it was
quarter-mile visibility and all the ocean was iced up. It was
neat.''
   The former Navy pilot said Christopher was not exaggerating the
danger they had faced.
   ``I went back in the clouds and came back down and then went
back around the mountains for about 20 minutes, trying to find the
runway desperately,'' he said. ``I didn't think I was going to
live.''
   Because Cunningham only flew the plane while it was
backtracking, he and Christopher both consider the youngster to
have been the pilot for a complete transatlantic crossing.
   Mrs. Marshall said she worried throughout the voyage, while
waiting at a Paris hotel room, but didn't realize until later how
frightening the experience could be for her son.
   ``If I knew, I don't think I would have let him go,'' she said.
   After engine repairs in Greenland, Christopher took the controls
again for the flight to Reykjavik, then on to Glasgow, Scotland,
where they stayed Wednesday night before the final leg to Paris.

   American and Malaysian planes
searched Thursday for a U.S. Navy jet with three men aboard that
went down in the South China Sea, a U.S. Navy spokesman said.
   Lt. Cmdr. James Van Sicle at Subic Naval Base said the crew of
the CT-39E twin-engine jet radioed Tuesday that it was ditching the
aircraft.
   Van Sicle said the plane was returning from Singapore to Subic,
50 miles northwest of Manila. He declined to release the identities
of the crew.
   Three planes from the U.S. Navy, two from the U.S. Air Force and
one from the Malaysian armed forces were taking part in the search
in an area southwest of the Philippines and east of the Spratly
Islands, Van Sicle said.

   Publication of search warrant affidavits in
the probe of defense industry fraud could prompt destruction of
evidence, said prosecutors in opposing efforts by two newspaper
publishers to unseal the papers.
   ``Revealing the contents of the affidavits may well encourage
document destruction and other acts that would have the practical
effect of putting major felons beyond the reach of justice,'' U.S.
Attorney Henry Hudson of the Eastern District of Virginia said in a
brief filed Wednesday.
   The Times Mirror Co. group, publisher of the Los Angeles Times,
and Copley Press Inc., publisher of the San Diego Union and the
Tribune, joined last week in efforts to have the affidavits made
public.
   The newspaper organizations petitioned to unseal all documents
relating to search warrants executed June 14 at Southern California
offices of the Northrop Corp., Teledyne Industries, Litton
Industries and the Los Angeles home of defense consultant Fred
Lackner.
   A hearing is scheduled Friday before a U.S. magistrate on
motions made by the news media organizations.
   The prosecutors contended that disclosure of the information,
which includes details of wiretaps and was used to persuade judges
to approve search warrants, could prompt destruction of evidence
and might encourage ``selective amnesia'' among witnesses.
   ``In the short time since the execution of the search warrants
became public, the government has already become aware of several
incidents of destruction of documents related to this case,'' said
the brief by Hudson and three of his assistants. They also noted
that ``the affidavits discuss specific statements from intercepted
conversations,'' which would clearly reveal the identities of
targets of the investigation.
   The publishers contend most information about the probe is
already public.
   The prosecutors asked that the affidavits remain sealed until
the investigation has progressed ``to the point where it can safely
withstand disclosure of the sealed information.''

   Two teen-age girls rescued an
87-year-old man from his burning house, and said they remembered
from a junior high school lesson what to do.
   Shontier McDaniels and Wanda Boone, both 15, were walking
Wednesday night with another friend, Chevon Moore, also 15, when
they noticed flames in the home of Josh Williams.
   Williams said he was watching television in his bedroom when he
felt heat behind him. He said he unsucessfully tried to douse the
blaze with water from his kitchen.
   Miss Moore went for help while Miss McDaniels and Miss Boone,
both students at McIntyre Junior High School, went to the house.
   ``Then I snatched the door open and realized (there) was too
much smoke in the house,'' Miss Boone said. ``Shontier and I began
to crawl on the floor on our knees.''
   They said they learned from fire safety films how to behave
during a fire.
   Confronted with thick smoke in the front of the house, the two
teen-agers crawled back out the front door, ran to the back of the
house and re-entered through the back door, again on their hands
and knees.
   ``I was on the floor crawling when I saw a lot of flames on the
right side of me,'' Miss McDaniels said, ``but I did not see Mr.
Williams because of the smoke.''
   But then she said she heard Williams throwing water on the fire.
   That enabled the two to locate Williams, and they grabbed him by
the arms and pulled him from the house.
   ``I was glad to see them,'' said Williams, who was not injured.
   Meanwhile, Miss Moore had located a neighbor who reported the
fire.
   Fire Capt. H.B. Hadden said the fire was caused by smoking in
bed.

   The City Council has voted
unanimously, including a black councilman, to name one of its city
parks in honor of former Mayor James R. Venable, a Ku Klux Klan
leader.
   Black councilman Robert Smith said he voted for the designation
because Venable had donated the land for the park and said the
attorney's Klan membership ``was not my concern.''
   But Coleman Seward, of the DeKalb County branch of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said he thought
the decision was ``awful.''
   Recreation director Barbara Holladay said Venable, a former
Imperial Wizard of the National Knights of the Ku Klux Klan,
donated the land to the city in the early 1970s. She said the
council voted Tuesday to name the park for Venable ``while we were
going through the master plan for parks and recreation.''
   Council members ``wanted to do it while he is still living,''
she said.
   ``We feel he should be recognized for giving the land to the
city,'' said Mayor Jane L. Rhodes.
   Gloria Brown, a black community leader, said that despite his
Klan activities, many black residents of the city think of Venable
as just another resident.
   ``Many black people have worked for him, and he has been very
good to them,'' she said.

   Water toys and a squeaking toy snake are being
recalled because of potential choking and lead hazards, the
Consumer Product Safety Commission said today.
   Beachcombers International of Fort Myers, Fla. said consumers
should remove the toys from children and return them to the
retailer for a refund. Toys involved are:
   _Big Mouth Fish, Hippo and Frog, plastic wind-up water toys
labeled ``Masudaya 1976 Made in Hong Kong.'' About 8,000 have been
sold nationally for about $2 each.
   _Devil Fish, a wind-up toy in the shape of a fish. Imported from
Hong Kong and sold for $2 in New Jersey and Virginia.
   _Lively Squeaking Snake, a plastic cobra snake 21 inches long
from China, sold nationally for $1.
   The toy snake contains an excessive amount of lead in the
surface coating, and the other toys have small parts which could
pose a choking hazard, the Safety Commission reports.
   People needing more information can call Beachcombers
International at 1-813-731-2111 or the Safety Commission at

   Hordes of jellyfish clogging the intake

to jam the system.
   Two truckloads of the clear jellyfish are removed daily from the
pipes used to pump water from the sea into the plant for
desalination.
   ``There's a continuous number of jellyfish, and we have men
working round the clock'' to remove them, said Abdulla Juma,
director of electricity for the island nation in the Persian Gulf.
   So many jellyfish are heading into the plant, he said, that

   The invasion, which baffles environmental experts, has yet to
affect production, Juma said.

<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with moire banks raising rate. No pickup.

<TEXT>
   Big banks raised their prime lending rate today
to the highest level in more than two years, a half-percentage
point rise to 9.5 percent, signaling more expensive loans for
consumers and businesses.
   It was the second boost in the key lending rate this year and
reflected the banks' own costs of borrowing money, which has been
rising steadily over the past few months.
   The prime is watched closely because bankers use it as a basis
for calculating loans to businesses and for determining many types
of fixed and adjustable-rate consumer loans, including popular
home-equity loans.
   Chase Manhattan Bank in New York was the first to announce the
rate increase and was quickly followed by other big banks,
including Citibank, First National Bank of Chicago, Bank of New
York and Manufacturers Hanover.
   The last increase in the prime was on May 11, from 8.5 percent
to 9 percent. The increase today put the prime at the highest point
since March 1986.
   Reaction in the financial markets was muted, partly because a
rise had been widely expected. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials was off less than a point to the 2,104
level by late morning.
   In the bond market, a sensitive barometer of the economy and
interest rate trends, the Treasury's key 30-year bond, was down
slightly in price, raising its yield to 9.18 percent from 9.17
percent late Wednesday.
   The prime rate rise came one day after Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan warned he would move to tighten credit if inflation
started to accelerate.
   Testifying in Congress, Greenspan said the Fed ``at this
juncture might be well advised to err more on the side of
restrictiveness rather than stimulus.''
   There has been growing evidence that inflation could rise
significantly this year. Low unemployment, strains on America's
productive capacities and rising commodity prices caused by the
drought point to higher consumer prices in the months ahead.
   Many economists have predicted that interest rates would rise
slightly this year but do not believe the increase will be dramatic.

   A Swiss cancer research foundation on
Thursday awarded its annual $265,000 prize to two West Germans and
a U.S.-based Spanish scientist for their work in genetics.
   The Dr. Josef Steiner Foundation prize was shared by Mariano
Barbacid of the National Cancer Institute in Frederick, Md., and
Thomas Graf and Hartmut Beug of the European Laboratory for
Molecular Biology in Heidelberg.
   Barbacid helped identify the characteristics of the first known
human cancer gene and discovered that certain chemicals cause
cancer by mutating this gene, the foundation's announcement said.
   Graf and Beug were honored for work on the effect of two
cancer-causing genes on blood cells and bone marrow.
   Steiner, a Swiss farmer's son who became pharmacist, died of
diabetes in 1983 at age 94. He willed his $6.5 million fortune to

<HEAD>Dukakis Phones Jackson and Their Negotiations Proceed, Chairman
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk said today
that Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis had spoken within the last
24 hours, and that two campaigns were continuing to talk although
platform negotiations remain broken off.
   ``I know there has been a conversation between the two
candidates and several conversations between the two campaigns,''
Kirk said. ``So I think we'll be moving forward to make sure there
are continuing discussions and hopefully we'll be able to resolve
any differences on substantive matters.''
   A day earlier, Jackson's convention manager, Ron Brown,
disappointed over Dukakis' selection of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen for his
running mate and angered that Jackson learned of the selection from
the press, said the campaign had broken off talks over 13 still
disputed platform issues.
   Asked if there are ongoing talks about the platform, Kirk said:
``At this moment there are not. The effort between the two
campaigns is to assure there will be.''
   He said Dukakis called Jackson ``within the last 24 hours.''
   He said Dukakis wanted ``to make sure that any
misunderstandings'' about how Jackson was informed of the decision
were resolved. ``I think it's ... just one of those matters of
timing and certainly wasn't intended as a signal of disrespect or
insensitivity,'' the chairman said.
   Kirk said he spoke with Jackson to explain his own role in
introducing Dukakis and Bentsen and the press conference announcing
Bentsen's selection in Boston on Tuesday, when Kirk presented them
as the 1988 party ticket.
   ``I talked with Jackson about that myself and I said the numbers
were clear in terms of the presidential nomination, the choice had
been made with respect to the vice presidential nomination, that
the party was anxious to direct its attention and its effort
against the Republicans in November without in any way turning our
back on the important contribution Rev. Jackson has and will
continue to make to that effort.
   He cited ``the reality of the numbers'' and added, ``I think
it's important for me and my role to continue to keep the focus on
the November election. ... The quicker all of us can close ranks
and button up the unified Democratic Party, I think it's in the
greater interest of succeeding in the fall.''
   Kirk said Jackson listened and added, ``He might have had a
different point of view.''
   Kirk also announced the addition of four speakers to the
convention program: Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., on defense and national
security issues; Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., on keeping a Senate
majority; Gov. Gerald Baliles of Virginia, representing the
Democratic governors; and Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., on the role of
the presidency.

   Cleanup crews today worked to
contain 630,000 gallons of crude oil spilled into the harbor when a
Singapore-owned tanker crashed into a mooring structure, the Coast
Guard said.
   Cleanup could take at least a week in what is believed to be the
worst spill in the port's history.
   The extent of any environmental damage was not immediately known.
   Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Dave Wilder said the Nord Pacific was
coming into dock when it struck a mooring spar late Wednesday. ``It
put an 8-foot by 1-foot gash in one of the cargo tanks about a foot
above the water line,'' Wilder said.
   Crews immediately placed oil containment booms alongside the
vessel, Wilder said.
   ``We've got vacuum trucks on scene removing the oil,'' he said.
``The wind is such that it's pushing it into the harbor and at this
point we're trying to contain it and get as much equipment on the
scene as soon as we can to remove it.''
   The Nord Pacific was en route to a refinery here when the
accident occurred.

   Vice President George Bush today called
the accidental U.S. destruction of an Iranian airliner carrying 290
people a ``terrible human tragedy'' but told the U.N. Security
Council that Iran shares in the responsibility.
   Presenting the U.S. case in the Security Council's debate on the
downing of Iran Air flight 655, Bush defended the U.S. naval
presence in the Persian Gulf as ``our legal right.'' Iran, which
asked for a council condemnation of the U.S. action, was
represented by its foreign minister, Ali-Akbar Velayati.
   Bush said that Iran ``allowed a civilian aircraft loaded with
passengers to proceed on a path over a warship engaged in battle.
That was irresponsible and a tragic error.''
   Velayati charged that the attack had been premeditated.
   ``This was the most inhuman military attack in the history of
civil aviation,'' he said, accusing the United States of
``arrogance, indifference and a campaign of lies ... to justify
this barbaric crime at any cost. ...
   ``This was a premeditated act of aggression against the
integrity of Tehran ... a massacre,'' he said.
   The vice president said he would not ``dignify with a response
the charge that we deliberately destroyed Iran Air 655.''
   And he said that Velayati ``knows better.''
   Bush called the Persian Gulf a ``region of vital importance to
the United States and the economy of the world.'' He said the U.S.
presence in the gulf was intended to help ensure the flow of oil
and protect neutral commerce. ``This is our legal right,'' he said.
   Bush accused Iran of ``reckless behavior toward neutral ships
engaged in lawful commerce.''
   Bush, as he has done repeatedly over the last few days, defended
the captain of the USS Vincennes. ``One thing is clear,'' he said,
``the USS Vincennes acted in self-defense'' in firing two missiles
at the jetliner, which it had deduced was an Iranian F-14 fighter
closing in on the cruiser.
   Bush called on Iran to immediately divert civilian air traffic
away from areas of ``active hostilities'' and to join with Iraq in
accepting an immediate cease-fire in the war that has raged since
1980.
   ``The victims of Iran Air 655 are only most recent casualties of
a brutal and senseless war that has brought immense pain and
suffering to the people of both sides,'' Bush said.
   Bush said he came to the United Nations, where he served as
ambassador from 1971 to 1973, at the request of President Reagan,
``because of the importance of the issues at stake.''
   Bush said it was ``not just the terrible human tragedy of Iran
Air 655 but the continuing conflict between Iran and Iraq'' that
brought him to speak.
   Speaking with reporters on Air Force Two as he flew to New York,
Bush said he had been selected because ``the president decided to
put some real emphasis on the policy of the United States by
elevating the level of representation.''
   The appearance is likely to give the prospective Republican
presidential nominee high visibility at a time when Democrats are
preparing to nominate Michael Dukakis as their presidential
candidate.
   However, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan's
selection of Bush ``reflects the importance of the issues at
stake'' and was not made for political reasons.
   The speech is Bush's first speech to the Security Council since
he was ambassador under President Nixon. U.N. officials said no
U.S. vice president had addressed the council in recent memory.
   In the days following the shooting down of the airliner, Bush
was outspoken in his defense of the captain of the U.S. cruiser
Vincennes, Will Rogers III, calling the episode in the Persian Gulf
``just an unhappy incident'' and telling audiences repeatedly,
``Life goes on.''
   The United States has said it will offer compensation to the
families of the victims, but that the mechanics and amount of the
offer have not been determined.
   Meanwhile, campaign aides said that Bush over the next few days
would settle on a process of selecting a running mate, now that the
Democratic ticket has been completed with Dukakis' selection of
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.
   Bush also decided to maintain a low profile during the early
days of the Democratic convention, extending a planned three-day
fishing trip with Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III to five
days.
   Baker, who managed Bush's 1980 presidential campaign and oversaw
President Reagan's 1984 re-election campaign, is expected to resign
his post later this summer to become Bush's campaign chairman.
   The vice president plans to make his vice presidential choice
privately, and intends to avoid divulging it until the Republican
National Convention in mid-August, said spokeswoman Sheila Tate.
   Bush plans to campaign from late Wednesday through the following
weekend, with appearances scheduled in Detroit, North Carolina,
South Carolina, New Jersey, Tennessee, Florida and New Mexico.

   Americans in two public opinion polls strongly
defended the United States for shooting down an Iranian passenger
plane early this month, although both surveys were conducted before
many details were known.
   In an ABC News-Washington Post poll conducted July 5, two days
after the incident, 71 percent of respondents said the U.S. action
was justified and 74 percent said Iran overall was more to blame
for the incident.
   In a USA Today-Cable News Network poll conducted the same day,
75 percent said the shooting was justified based on what was known
at the time and 61 percent said Iran was more responsible than the
United States for the incident.
   Immediate one-day polls such as these often measure visceral
reactions rather than thoughtful opinion. Their sample sizes are
about half that of most national surveys.
   The United States initially claimed that the Iran Air jet with
290 people aboard was outside a commercial air lane when a Navy
warship shot it down. The United States later withdrew that claim,
after the polls had been conducted.
   The Navy has said its warship, the USS Vincennes, mistook the
jet for an Iranian F-14 fighter, and that it fired after the jet
failed to respond to repeated radio warnings. It has said the jet
took off an hour later and appeared to be descending in what was
seen as a hostile flight pattern.
   The British intelligence agency reportedly has supported Iran's
claim that the jet took off on time and was climbing, not
descending, when it was shot down. That report also came after the
polls were conducted.
   In other findings in the ABC-Post poll, 72 percent said the
downing was ``an understandable accident'' rather than ``a stupid
mistake,'' 80 percent said the captain of the Vincennes acted
properly and 61 percent opposed U.S. payments to families of the
victims. In the USA Today-CNN poll, 48 percent opposed financial
compensation to the families.
   The ABC-Post poll was conducted by telephone among 524 adults,
the USA Today-CNN poll among 646. Both had error margins of about 4
points.

<HEAD>Senator Chafee Is Latest Victim In Filing Papers Flap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. John H. Chafee has become the third
Rhode Island politician in danger of losing his ballot position
because of a minor problem on his candidacy papers.
   John J. Staradumsky, an independent candidate for Chafee's seat,
has filed a formal objection to Chafee's candidacy, meaning the
state Board of Elections must decide whether to throw Chafee off
the ballot, board Chairman Joseph R. DiStefano said Wednesday.
   The two-term Republican senator listed his Warwick address on
his filing form as 1128 Ives Road, while his voter registration
card omits the house number. State law requires the two forms to
match exactly.
   Similar discrepancies already have jeopardized the candidacies
of Republican Rep. Claudine Schneider and Democratic gubernatorial
candidate Bruce G. Sundlun. Gov. Edward D. DiPrete said at the time
he would call a special session of the General Assembly if
necessary to get them back on the ballot.
   Michael Ryan, a Chafee aide, said Wednesday homes on Ives Road
were not numbered when Chafee registered to vote in 1953.
   ``We expect common sense to prevail, hopefully in all cases, but
certainly in this one,'' Ryan said.
   The elections board will hear Chafee's case July 26. It has
scheduled a July 25 hearing on the Schneider and Sundlun cases.
   If the board rules against Chafee, he would hae to run a
write-in campaign against Democrat Richard A. Licht in the Nov. 8
general election. Chafee is unopposed for renomination.
   DiStefano has refused to predict what his board will do, but
said it has ruled ``time and time again'' against lesser-known
candidates who made similar mistakes.
   ``Everybody knows what the precedents are,'' he said. ``We've
indicated that quite clearly.''

<TEXT>
   A Yale alumnus charged with setting fire
to anti-apartheid shanties on the Ivy League campus was placed on
two year's probation today.
   Dr. Elwood Bracey, 52, of West Palm Beach, Fla., was not
required to admit guilty in receiving special probation under which
the charge will be dismissed and his arrest record erased if he
fulfills terms set by the judge.
   Bracey said the June 5 fire was not a racist act and that he set
the blaze because of the shanties' proximity to a war memorial. He
is a Vietnam veteran.
   ``I feel strongly about the war memorial at Yale,'' he told
Superior Court Judge Robert Reilly today. ``It was defamed by the
vulgar shanties.''
   Reilly ordered physician to pay $5,000 apiece to the Yale
Coalition Against Apartheid and the Fire Department for a video
camera and cellular telephone.
   Bracey was als required to pay Yale an unspecified sum for
damage caused by the fire and perform 400 hours of community and
medical service.
   Anti-apartheid activists had argued the crime was too serious to
justify special probation.
   ``It's just a way to whitewash the issue,'' Charlotte Hitchcock
of the Coalition Against Apartheid said before Wednesday's hearing.
   Bracey, who was at Yale for an alumni weekend the day of the
fire, was apprehended blocks away by another alumnus who said he
was jogging when he saw Bracey, dressed in a suit and tie, fleeing
the burning shanties.
   Bracey was charged with arson. He had been free on $50,000 bond
since his arrest.
   The shanties had stood for more than two years near the
university's administration building. The ramshackle array was
built by students to protest apartheid and Yale's investments in
companies doing business in South Africa.
   A 40-foot wooden memorial wall was erected June 16 to replace
the shanties.
   Assistant State's Attorney Burton A. Kaplan said the
prosecution, Yale and the Police and Fire departments took no
position on Bracey's application.
   ``It's one of those cases where it's up to the judge,'' Kaplan
said.

   France on Thursday celebrated the 199th anniversary
of the storming of the Bastille, and the president said he was
inviting leaders of rich and poor nations to help fete the
bicentennial of the French Revolution.
   Tens of thousands of people, celebrating the national holiday,
lined the Champs Elysees to watch the traditional grandiose July 14
military parade.
   Planes trailing exhaust in the blue, white and red of the French
tricolor swept low over the Champs Elysees to open the parade of
6,000 men, 120 aircraft, 500 land vehicles and 300 members of the
cavalry.
   President Francois Mitterrand reviewed the troops at the Arch of
Triumph, now draped in tricolor to hide renovation work, then moved
down the avenue to the reviewing stand at the Place de la Concorde.
   Twelve Mirage 2000 Ns, designed to carry nuclear missiles, made
their first public appearance in a sweep over the Champs Elysees,
as Foreign Legionaires with white kepis and the Republican Guard
with feathered brass helmets strutted below.
   More than 4,000 invited guests attended a garden party at the
presidential Elysee Palace, where from a back lawn Mitterrand gave
a televised interview, his eighth such July 14 interview since
coming to power in 1981.
   Thursday night, a massive fireworks display designed to call in
the year of the bicentennial was planned at the Palais de Chaillot,
facing the Eiffel Tower across the Seine river.
   The storming of the ancient Bastille prison on July 14, 1789,
where just seven prisoners were held, led to the fall of the French
monarchy and the proclamation of the republic three years later.
   ``I want the Third World to be present that day,'' Mitterrand
said of next year's bicentennial celebrations. ``This universal
presence in Paris of a world so different in its realities ... is a
great thing.''
   Leaders of the seven major industrialized democracies are to
hold their annual summit meeting in Paris July 14-16, 1989, it was
announced at the Toronto summit in June.
   Mitterrand said Thursday he planned to invite ``many heads of
state or government from poor countries, our African friends, from
Latin American countries.''

   A newborn taken from her hospital crib
two days ago was back in her parents' arms today after FBI agents
arrested an Ohio woman on charges of kidnapping the child by posing
as a nurse, officials said.
   The woman, Linda Lou German, had called an abduction hotline and
insisted the child was hers, then came to the hospital with the
baby, a prosecutor said. German, 26, of Wheelersburg, Ohio, was
charged with a federal count of kidnapping, which carries a
sentence of up to life in prison, said Assistant U.S. Attorney
Joseph Savage Jr.
   German, who has a 3{-year-old daughter, had ``endured some sort
of trauma'' and ``she wanted a baby of her own,'' said Janet
Ferguson, a spokesman at Cabell Huntington Hospital.
   Prosecutors said German will undergo a psychiatric examination.
   Arraignment scheduled for this morning was delayed without
explanation.
   Three-day-old Lindsey Manns was in good health at the hospital,
Ferguson said.
   Savage said German had called an abduction hotline at 9 p.m.
Wednesday, saying she had an infant and ``My relatives don't
believe it's mine.''
   German arrived at the hospital with the baby Wednesday night and
told FBI agents she had given birth in early July at a Lexington,
Ky., hospital, the prosecutor said.
   The FBI called the hospital, where there was no record of the
birth, and a doctor's exam determined she hadn't given birth
recently, he said.
   The infant was taken Tuesday from Cabell Huntington Hospital's
third-floor maternity ward. Officials said they believed the
kidnapper, wearing a nurse's uniform, carried the baby through the
front door.
   On Wednesday, Donald and Linda Manns had tearfully pleaded for
the return of their daughter.
   ``I'd just like to say, whoever's got it, please bring it
back,'' Donald Manns said. ``Just call and tell us it's all right.''
   The prosecutor said German was believed to have been involved in
an attempted abduction Sunday of another baby born at the same
hospital. No charges have been filed in that case, he said.
   In that case, a woman told state police that after she delivered
her baby at the hospital, she received a visit from a stranger who
told her she had recently lost a newborn baby.
   The mother told police that the woman showed up at her home in
Mingo County with a gift for the baby.
   Once inside, police were told, the woman was allowed to hold the
baby, then brandished a knife and threatened to take the infant.
State police said the intruder fled when another person walked into
the room.
   ``We suspect a connection between the two incidents because of
the time frame and the fact that both incidents involve babies born
at the same hospital,'' said Sgt. F.H. Butler.

   A Cuban official today denied that
agreement was reached in principle for Cuba to withdraw its troops
from Angola. The statement contradicted a U.S. announcement.
   ``I would say it is not precise to say that an agreement has
been reached on the withdrawal of Cuban troops,'' said Alcibiades
Hidalgo, a member of the policy-making central committee of Cuba's
Communist Party.
   ``This issue ... is part of all the discussions, is part of a
process that is continuing. I would qualify it as inexact to say
that an agreement has been reached on the withdrawal of all Cuban
troops,'' he added.
   ``It is our opinion that we made substantial progress,'' he
said, speaking in Spanish through an interpreter.
   On Wednesday, Chester A. Crocker, under-secretary of state in
charge of African affairs, said that Angolan, Cuban, and South
African delegates agreed that Pretoria would end its 73-year rule
in South-West Africa and that Cuban troops would leave Angola.
Crocker said no schedule was set for the pullout.
   ``As a result of these 2{ days, the Angolans, Cubans, and South
Africans were able to reach agreement on a set of principles which
constitute the essential elements of a political settlement in
southwestern Africa,'' said Crocker, who led the host American
delegation at talks that began Monday.
   Hidalgo was not the most senior member of the Cuban delegation.
It was led by Carlos Aldana, another member of the party's central
committee. He did not appear at today's press conference.
   Crocker said the South African administration in South-West
Africa, also known as Namibia, would be replaced by U.N. civil and
military administrators to comply with a U.N. resolution calling
for that nation's independence under black majority rule.
   ``There are some large gaps that remain,'' Crocker said. ``For
example, the existing gap on the timing of the Cuban troop
withdrawal from Angola is a major issue. I think the parties agreed
that this was not the time to come to grips with that issue, and we
agree with that judgment.''
   Crocker said details of the principles would not be released
until approval by their respective governments.
   South Africa has said it would accept a U.N. Security Council
resolution calling for South-West Africa's independence when the
estimated 50,000 Cuban troops withdraw from neighboring Angola.
   The U.S. goal is a full Cuban troop withdrawal in one year, the
same time span that the U.N. resolution sets for granting
independence to Namibia.
   Angola and Cuba had insisted that the Cuban withdrawal should
take place over four years.
   In Washington today, U.N. Ambassador Vernon Walters told ``CBS
This Morning'' that many obstacles remain, including obtaining
approval of the governments involved and setting a schedule for the
troop withdrawals.
   ``This war has been going on for 15 years. There's a whole lot
of hostility built up,'' he said.
   The United States was a party to the talks because it has been
supporting anti-communist rebels in Angola with funds and weapons
since 1985.
   Asked if the United States would still support the rebels,
Walters said, ``That's a decision taken in the light of
circumstances. Certainly the Soviets are still supporting the
Luanda government.''
   Private meetings among the negotiators began Monday under tight
security at the U.S. Coast Guard station on Governors Island in New
York Harbor.
   Both the Angolan and South African delegates expressed optimism
during the talks _ a marked contrast to the usual rancor and
recriminations in statements about each other.
   Angola has been convulsed by civil war since it gained
independence from Portugal in 1975. The Marxist one-party
government has been fighting the anti-communist rebels in the
south, who call themselves UNITA, for National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola.
   South Africa has repeatedly sent troops across the border from
Namibia into Angola to support the UNITA rebel forces in their
clashes with Cuban and Angolan forces.
   Namibia has been ruled by South Africa since World War I, when
the League of Nations gave it a mandate to administer the
territory. The League's successor, the United Nations, has revoked
that mandate.
   The four parties first met in London in early May, then
reconvened last month in Cairo, Egypt. South African and Angolan
officials held a separate meeting in May in Brazzaville, the Congo.

   A man driving a weapons carrier believed
stolen from an Army National Guard Armory led police on a chase
through the District of Columbia before crashing into a cement
barrier outside the U.S. Capitol early Thursday, officials said.
   ``The vehicle wasn't armed,'' said Walt Ferguson, a spokesman
for the Metropolitan Police Department. ``But it's capable of
carrying missiles and automatic weapons.''
   The camouflage-colored vehicle was discovered missing at about
6:30 a.m. EDT from the Maryland Army National Guard's Armory
Compound in Annapolis, according to Lt. Col. Howard Freedlander, a
spokesman for the National Guard.
   The thief broke the lock on the fence gate, then broke into the
vehicle, which starts with a switch instead of a key, Freedlander
said.
   ``It's an odd-looking vehicle,'' Freedlander said. ``If you saw
it on the road, it would really stand out.''
   Despite that, the driver managed to drive 50 miles from
Annapolis into the District of Columbia before police officers
spotted the vehicle about 2:30 a.m. and gave chase.
   The driver led officers at high speeds through the city,
striking two cruisers before plowing into a large stone barricade
at the north entrance to the Capitol. Police apprehended Dadailies
Ditgilvanni, 18, of Chestertown, Md., at the scene.
   The stolen vehicle, known in the military as a HMMWV, is a
light, highly mobile, four-wheel drive vehicle. A relatively new
vehicle that replaced the standard Army jeep, it can travel at
speeds up to 70 mph.
   The stolen HMMWV contained a missile carrier but no missiles or
weapons, Freedlander said.
   The Annapolis compound is surrounded by a chain-link fence, but
does not have a 24-hour security system. The vehicles are stored
there for training purposes.
   Ditgilvanni was charged with two counts of assault on a police
officer and one count of unauthorized use of a vehicle. He was
hospitalized with minor injuries which police said he suffered
during the chase, Ferguson said. No police officers were injured.
   The reason for the vehicle's theft and its trip to Washington
were not known.

   State law allows Lloyd Bentsen to appear on
the Texas ballot as a candidate for both vice president and
re-election to the Senate, giving him a chance to protect his
Senate seat from the Republicans at least for the time being.
   ``I can't get off the ticket in Texas. That's the way the law is
written,'' Democrat Bentsen says. ``If I was to step off the
ticket, that would forfeit it to the Republican challenger, and I
can't do that.''
   Bentsen's bid for a fourth Senate term is being challenged by
Republican Rep. Beau Boulter, a two-term conservative from
Amarillo, who has been fighting an uphill battle in the race.
   Boulter is making as much as he can of Bentsen's dual candidacy,
declaring, ``It's wrong. It's unethical. And it's going to raise
questions throughout this campaign.''
   Michael Dukakis, the expected Democratic presidential nominee,
picked Bentsen on Tuesday to be his running mate.
   That put Bentsen in a two-race campaign that's allowed under a
1959 state law written for then-Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson, who wanted
it so he could run for both re-election and the White House. His
presidential bid failed, but he became John Kennedy's vice
president and later became president after Kennedy was assassinated.
   Texas Secretary of State Jack Rains, the state's chief election
officer, says withdrawal by Bentsen now would give the Senate race
to Republican Boulter. Bentsen could remove his name from the
Senate ballot before Sept. 6, but the Democrats could not replace
him.
   If Bentsen wins both elections, he would have to choose one post
or the other. If he gave up his Senate seat, as expected,
Republican Gov. Bill Clements would name an interim senator and
then call a special election to pick someone to complete the
six-year term.
   The special election, Rains said, would be a ``Florida scramble.
Everyone just goes out and tees it up.''
   Interest is already high and rising.
   On Tuesday, Lt. Gov. Bill Hobby said he would ``certainly
seriously consider'' running if such a special election takes place.
   On Wednesday, state Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower said,
``I am, like every other person of voting age in Texas, considering
making the Senate race.'' Hightower already had been looking at a
1990 race against Republican Sen. Phil Gramm.
   Among other Democrats looking at entering the Senate scramble
are former Gov. Mark White and Reps. Mike Andrews and Mickey
Leland, both of Houston, and John Bryant of Dallas. Attorney
General Jim Mattox also has expressed interest.
   On the Republican side, Reps. Jack Fields of Houston and Steve
Bartlett of Dallas have shown interest.
   The 1961 special election to replace Johnson in the Senate drew
more than 70 candidates. Republican John Tower won.

<TEXT>
   Departing Attorney General Edwin Meese III
will join the Heritage Foundation next month to write and lecture
on issues ranging from drugs to the Constitution, the conservative
Washington research center said Thursday.
   Meese, the subject of a just-completed 14-month criminal
investigation, said he looks forward ``to a more reflective period,
without the white heat and daily pressures'' of government work
when he joins the Heritage Foundation as a ``Distinguished Fellow.''
   Meese also will be a ``Distinguished Visiting Fellow'' at the
Hoover Institution at Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., the
Justice Department said.
   Heritage Foundation President Edward Feulner called Meese ``one
of the conservative movement's most valuable resources.''
   Hoover Institution President Glenn Campbell said it will be
``very good to have Mr. Meese in our coffee room, so that scholars
learn that translating their ideas into policy and programs isn't
quite as simple as they think it is.''
   At the Heritage Foundation, Executive Vice President Phil
Truluck said ``Ed Meese more than anyone is symbolic of the ideas
of the Reagan revolution and we're pleased that he's come to
Heritage to continue to fight for those ideas.''
   In articles, lectures and round-table discussions, Meese will
address questions concerning drugs, criminal justice and the
Constitution, but will delve into other areas in view of his broad
experience as head of the Reagan administration's Domestic Policy
Council, said Truluck.
   Meese was counselor to President Reagan from 1981 to 1985 before
becoming attorney general. Truluck said Meese's articles will be
printed in Heritage publications and placed in other journals.
   The Heritage Foundation and the Hoover Institution have hosted
several former Reagan administration officials.
   Secretary of State George Shultz has already agreed to join the
Hoover Institution staff after he leaves office.
   Meese announced July 5 that he would leave the administration by
next month. He said he had been vindicated in a criminal probe of
his activities because independent counsel James McKay had decided
not to seek his indictment.
   McKay filed an 830-page report that is to be made public
shortly. It was referred last week to Solicitor General Charles
Fried, a step that could lead to an ethics review of Meese by the
Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility.
   Meese has worked for Reagan longer than any other aide, joining
him when Reagan was elected governor of California in 1966 and
working as a senior staff member until 1974.
   He taught at the University of California School of Law in
Berkeley from 1965 to 1967 and was director of the center for
criminal justice policy and management at the University of San
Diego from 1977 to 1981.
   Meanwhile Thursday, Richard Thornburgh, President Reagan's
nominee to become attorney general, said he will soon talk to top
Justice Department officials about improving morale following
Meese's departure.
   ``I want to take a very careful look at what the level of
commitment and what the level of morale is within the department,''
Thornburgh said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' program.
   ``I hope within the next week or so to begin some conversations
with key people in the department so I can make that assessment (of
morale) and we can deal with whatever problems exist there,'' said
Thornburgh, who was interviewed from Boston.

   Michael Dukakis telephoned Jesse Jackson in an
attempt to improve their strained relations, according to the
Democratic Party chairman, who today predicted a resolution of
differences that threatened to disrupt the national convention next
week.
   Dukakis' plans for a show of unity have been clouded by
Jackson's hints that he might challenge the selection of Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas for the No. 2 spot on the ticket.
   The Massachusetts governor phoned Jackson ``within the last 24
hours'' to ensure that any misunderstandings about how Jackson was
informed of Bentsen's selection were resolved, said Paul Kirk,
Democratic National Committee chairman. Jackson first learned of
the selection from reporters, not Dukakis.
   ``I think it's ... just one of those matters of timing and
certainly wasn't intended as a signal of disrespect or
insensitivity,'' the chairman said.
   Jackson hinted Wednesday that he might challenge Dukakis'
selection of Bentsen at the convention.
   Asked in Chicago if there would be a floor fight next Thursday
when the convention is asked to ratify Dukakis' choice, Jackson
said, ``I'm not suggesting that I will compete for a place on the
ticket, but the floor is wide open on Thursday night when the
recommendation is made.''
   Informed of Jackson's comments, Dukakis said, ``I'm confident
we'll have a united convention.''
   Kirk acknowledged that negotiations on the platform are still
stalled, and he said he had personally talked to Jackson to explain
his role in the Tuesday announcement of Bentsen as Dukakis's
running mate.
   Despite the problems, the party chairman said, ``I think we'll
be moving forward to make sure there are continuing discussions and
hopefully we'll be able to resolve any differences on substantive
matters.''
   On Wednesday, Dukakis, drawing an obvious contrast to Republican
rival George Bush's service in the Reagan administration, says he
would expect his vice president to ``challenge me'' and spell out
differences on issues and policies.
   At a Capitol Hill news conference, Dukakis and Bentsen
acknowledged they differ on some issues but insisted they were in
broad agreement on job creation, education, fair housing and health
care.
   Dukakis and Bentsen met with reporters after a day of joint
appearances in the nation's capital during which they tried to
dampen discontent among blacks angry over the fact that Jackson
received no advance notice of the selection of Bentsen.
   After a fund-raiser at the Georgetown home of Pamela Harriman,
Dukakis returned to Boston and the struggle to find about $100
million in cuts to bring his state budget into balance.
   His state budget problems are a potential embarrassment to
Dukakis as he prepares to accept the Democratic presidential
nomination at the party's national convention next week in Atlanta.
   His abilities as a manager and the robust economy of his state
have been cornerstones of Dukakis' campaign to convince voters he
is the most qualified presidential candidate.
   Dukakis and Bentsen were asked repeatedly about their
differences on such questions as abortion, school prayer, Contra
aid and the 1981 tax cuts proposed by President Reagan.
   ``As long he's a U.S. senator from Texas, he's going to vote his
conscience,'' said the Massachusetts governor.
   Then he added, ``If we are elected in November, then obviously
the relationship will change.''
   Bentsen had no argument with that assessment.
   ``As vice president of the United States, I would give him the
very best counsel I could when I agreed or disagreed on the
issues,'' said the Texas senator. ``But there's only one president
of the United States and he's the man that bears the ultimate
responsibility and pays the ultimate price.''
   Dukakis said, ``One of the reasons I picked Lloyd Bentsen is
because I know he will challenge me as vice president.''
   The Massachusetts governor also seemed determined to contrast
what he would expect from a vice president to the perception that
Bush often has played a passive role in that office _ at least so
far as can be gleaned from the public record.
   Bush told reporters in California last spring, ``I hold back
speaking in meetings because I don't want the president tohave to
be choosing between his vice president and the other members of the
Cabinet. And I hold back sometimes because I worry about leaks.''
   The prospective Democratic ticket got a cool reception during a
joint appearance at the annual convention of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, but Dukakis
said, ``I thought it was terrific.''
   ``I understand there were a great many people in that room who
are actively involved in the Jackson candidacy, who cared very
deeply about it and are disappointed he didn't win,'' he said.
   The reception was no different than a Greek-American group would
give Jackson if he appeared before them after defeating Dukakis in
a race for the nomination, he said.

   Gastroenteritis and cholera have claimed
14 lives in the capital over the past four days, a city official
said Thursday.
   Heavy monsoon rains began recently, and most of the deaths have
occurred in the eastern suburbs of New Delhi on the banks of the
Yamuna river. Many of the neighborhoods do not have proper
sanitation facilities.
   Four children were among the victims of gastroenteritis that has
spread in some camps run by the government for the poor people.
   The official of the Municipal Corporation of New Delhi, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said seven of the 14 people had died of
cholera.
   Water-borne diseases are spreading in areas with inadequate
sanitation, he said. Some water lines were reportedly contaminated
by sewage.

   Japan will build a replica of Christopher
Columbus's ship, the Santa Maria, and sail it from Spain to Japan
in 1992 to mark the 500th anniversary of the explorer's discovery
of America, an official said Thursday.
   Akihiko Osugi, an official at Kadokawa Publishing Co., said the
plan was announced Wednesday by company president Haruki Kadokawa,
who is chairman of the organizing committee.
   Osugi said that at the suggestion of Eikichi Hayashiya, a former
Japanese ambassador to Spain, Kadokawa and other businessmen,
politicians and scholars decided to fulfill Columbus' dream of
sailing from Spain to Japan.
   He said Japanese technicians will build a replica of the
three-mast Santa Maria, used by Columbus when he discovered
American in 1492. The replica, to be built in Barcelona, Spain,
will cost $9.85 million, he said.

<HEAD>Mother Gives Birth, Then Abandons Baby on Plane</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with woman surrendering. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman suspected of giving birth in an
airline bathroom and stuffing the infant under the sink was
arrested this morning for investigation of attempted murder.
   Christina Locasto, 24, of New York City turned herself in to San
Mateo County Sheriff's deputies in Redwood City and was jailed on
$50,000 bail, said Lt. Mike Dow.
   A United Airlines cleaning crew found the infant in a
blood-spattered bathroom about 20 minutes after Flight 35 from
Newark, N.J., landed at San Francisco International Airport on
Wednesday, authorities said.
   ``The cleaning crew heard the baby crying, and that was what led
them to the baby,'' said Rob Doughty, an airline spokesman in
Chicago.
   Minutes earlier, the mother had disappeared among the 252 other
passengers who had disembarked after the non-stop flight. The baby
apparently had been born five hours earlier, before the plane took
off, Dow said.
   ``She had the baby and she stuffed it under the sink. That's
attempted murder,'' Dow said.
   The baby was listed in good condition at Mills Memorial Hospital
in San Mateo, where nurses named the 8-pound, 9-ounce girl
Elizabeth. The brown-haired, blue-eyed infant is ``just
beautiful,'' said spokeswoman Traci Ward.
   Locasto's husband, Louis, 26, who traveled with her and their
3-year-old daughter on the flight from New Jersey, was not
arrested. ``We have reason to believe at this time he didn't know
she was pregnant,'' Dow said.
   Detectives traced Locasto through the passenger list and
contacted the couple's relatives on the East Coast, who contacted
relatives the Locastos were visiting in Los Altos, Dow said. The
couple had planned to go to Disneyland, he said.
   After a series of telephone calls, Mrs. Locasto turned herself
in, accompanied by a lawyer, Dow said.
   Dow said flight attendants told him a woman had asked to use the
bathroom as the flight prepared to leave. The plane was delayed 30
minutes as attendants pounded on the door, urging her to come out
so the plane could take off, he said.

   There's nothing like a presidential visit
into drought-ravaged territory to get the rains falling again _ at
least in the eyes of farmer Herman Krone.
   ``It just tickles me to death,'' said Krone, who today hosted
President Reagan at his 2,800-acre farm in Southern Illinois. ``If
he (Reagan) can make it rain, he's done enough for me.''
   Reagan walked through corn and soybean fields on the farm,
towering over the corn, normally 8 feet high by now but today less
than half that height. Soybean plants were a quarter of their
expected size.
   ``What I saw was not a pretty sight,'' Reagan said.
   The nearly 2 inches of rain recorded on Krone's farm this week
is turning once-parched fields into muddy pastures. And 25 miles
away in Marion, motorists have been driving through flooded
downtown streets.
   ``Four or five days ago, my corn looked like pineapples ...
leaves dying,'' the 63-year-old Krone, a Reagan admirer, said
Wednesday.
   Until Monday's rain _ sporadic showers have soaked the area
since _ ``the grass would just crack under your feet,'' he said.
   ``The grass is starting to come back, and if I can get some
continued rain, I could get some recovery on my pastures.''
   Today's forecast called for mostly sunny skies, hot and humid
conditions with highs in the 90s.
   Agriculture experts, however, insist that recent rain _ up to 4
inches over some of the flatland region _ won't help much of the
already damaged corn crop.
   But the president's visit, they say, is a good gesture on
Reagan's part and should help get federal aid for farmers who have
substantial crop loss.
   ``Myself, I'm not looking for a handout,'' said Krone, who added
that he doesn't receive any federal subsidies. ``I can survive if
there's no rain and it (the drought) continues.''
   Even so, at the Krone farm Reagan saw some 400 acres of a
1,200-acre corn crop that is irreversibly damaged by drought, an
estimated $35,000 loss.
   Corn stalks that should be 10- to 12-feet high by this time of
year only measure from 2- to 5-feet with burnt, brownish tassels,
the farmer said.
   The dry spell also has parched 125 acres of pasture used to feed
Krone's 150 head of cattle. For the past month, he's had to feed
the cattle alfalfa hay.
   ``My farm will be a good representation of the drought, although
it has rained here,'' said Krone, dressed in a blue-and-beige
``Agratech'' cap, a gray T-shirt, faded blue jeans and leather work
boots.
   Reagan was scheduled for stops in Moline, Ill., and neighboring
Davenport, Iowa, before returning to Washington, D.C..
   ``Even though it has rained, when the president looks at the
crops, he's going to see a bad situation,'' said Steve Newman of
the Illinois Farm Bureau. ``There's nothing like looking at the
problem square in the face and making some decisions.''
   Bob Spitze, professor of agriculture economics at the University
of Illinois, said the Reagan visit adds support to a $5.5 billion
relief-drought package under consideration by Congress.
   ``Now that the administration has said, `The condition has
worsened enough, it is a major catastrophe and we need
legislation,' it legitimizes the relief-drought package which has
already been developed,'' he said.

   As the presidential race begins in earnest,
nearly 60 percent of the Americans who plan to vote say they
already have decided whom to support, a Media General-Associated
Press poll has found.
   A third of the remainder are strongly leaning to Vice President
George Bush or Gov. Michael Dukakis, leaving just 23 percent of
voters as the undecided group that is likely to decide the
election, the poll found.
   Among those who said they have decided on a candidate, 48
percent in the national survey of 1,223 adults backed Dukakis and
42 percent supported Bush. The race was a dead heat among the
strong leaners.
   The remaining undecided group was dominated by voters of the
middle ground: half were self-described moderates and nearly half
said they were independents.
   There was no clear sign where those voters might go. While
Dukakis led among moderates and independents who have decided
already, the race was closer for the moderates and independents who
were leaning strongly.
   Other national polls have sought to measure the candidates'
standings among all registered voters, a broader gauge that also
has showed a close contest. A CBS News-New York Times poll Monday
had it 47-39 for Dukakis.
   The Media General-AP poll, with a 3 point margin of error
overall, was conducted by telephone June 22 to July 2 among 1,223
randomly selected adults. It was completed before Dukakis named
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas as his running mate Tuesday.
   Another finding of the poll countered the suggestion that voters
place great value on a exciting style that is lacking in Dukakis
and Bentsen, and in Bush on the Republican side. Only 5 percent
said they value a candidate's personal style over his position on
the issues, while 79 percent said issues were more important.
Twelve percent said the two were equally important.
   The survey found a virtual tossup in perceptions of the
political parties' abilities to handle key issues _ a common
measure of voter leanings at this stage of the race. The result
emphasized the closeness of the race: In the most frequently cited
economic and social issues, the deficit and drugs, the parties were
rated equally.
   Respondents were asked, regardless of whether or how they may
vote, which party was best able to deal with important issues. On
economic matters, 34 percent said the federal deficit was
paramount, and they were evenly split on which party can best
handle the deficit: 34 percent said the Republicans, 31 percent
said the Democrats. The rest had no opinion.
   The Democrats were favored strongly on unemployment, the next
most-often cited economic issue of six that were offered.
Twenty-eight percent said unemployment was most important, and
nearly half said Democrats were best able to handle it. Fewer than
a fifth picked the Republicans.
   Inflation was rated third as the key economic issue, cited by 13
percent, and again the parties were ranked equally in their ability
to handle it. Dealing with foreign trade, rated fourth, went to the
Republicans, 42-32.
   On social issues, more than a third of respondents said illegal
drugs were the most important of six choices, and nearly a fifth
each cited poverty and AIDS. The parties ranked evenly on handling
drugs, but Democrats were rated far better on poverty, 51-17
percent, and better on AIDS, 33-20 percent.
   Republicans were rated better, 40-24, on dealing with crime, the
next most-cited social issue. Democrats did better on handling the
last two issues _ the environment, 49-20, and civil rights, 56-12.
   On foreign affairs, a fifth of respondents said U.S.-Soviet
relations was the key issue, a fifth said it was the spread of
nuclear weapons and nearly a fifth said it was unrest in the Middle
East.
   Republicans were judged better able than the Democrats to handle
the Soviets, 44-32, and Middle East unrest, 38-29. The parties were
rated about evenly on their ability to deal with nuclear
proliferation.
   Unrest in Central America and the Third World debt were ranked
lower in importance; the Republicans scored better at handling
Central America, 44-33, while the parties were rated evenly on
dealing with the debt crisis.
   For the respondents who said they planned to vote, economic
issues in general were the most important, cited by 55 percent.
Just 13 percent said social issues were the most important, and 10
percent said foreign affairs; 21 percent volunteered that the three
were equally important.
   The Media General-AP poll consisted of telephone interviews June
22-July 2 with a randomly selected sample of 1,223 adults across
the nation. Media General Inc., a communications company based in
Richmond, Va., publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond
News Leader, the Tampa (Fla). Tribune and the Winston-Salem (N.C.)
Journal, and operates TV stations WXFL in Tampa, WCBD in

<HEAD>Driver Who Hit Children Was `Teaching Passengers a Lesson'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man accused of killing two children
when he drove through a school crossing at at least 50 mph was
speeding to ``teach his passengers a lesson'' for making him late
to work, investigators say.
   Michael D. Brandon, 21, who had no driver's license, failed to
stop even when a police officer stood in his path and aimed his gun
at him, police said.
   Two other children, including a 12-year-old crossing guard in
plastic hat and vest, were injured Tuesday when the car struck them
as they walked in front of Hawthorne Elementary School.
   Brandon had been speeding ``to teach his passengers a lesson for
making him late to work'' at his job as a janitor, investigators
said Wednesday.
   He was held without bail for investigation of two counts of
murder, two of assault with a deadly weapon and one of assault with
a deadly weapon _ the car _ on a police officer.
   Police said Brandon's vehicle was going at least 50 mph when it
swerved around a car stopped in front of the crosswalk.
   An Alameda police officer, in Oakland to make an unrelated
arrest, tried to stop the car by standing in its way, revolver
drawn, but the car didn't slow, and the officer couldn't shoot
because of the crowd of children, police said.
   He leaped aside at the last moment, said to Lt. Jim Hahn.
   The car was found two miles away and a witness led police to
Brandon's home nearby. Brandon's two passengers came forward on
their own and face no charges.
   Brandon told police he fled because ``he just didn't want to be
there because it was such a mess,'' officers said.
   The accident killed 10-year-old Rene Zuniga, and his cousin,
8-year-old Carlita Rosales. Carlita's sister, 6-year-old Angela
Rosales, was in good condition at Children's Hospital with a
concussion and fractured leg.
   The crossing guard, Maglia Dominguez, suffered a broken collar
bone. She was released from Kaiser Hospital on Wednesday.
   ``It was going fast, fast,'' she told The (Oakland) Tribune. ``I
saw it hit the kids. They bent like this,'' she said, bending
forward at the waist. ``Then the car hit me, but I don't remember
hitting the street.''

   Iran told the Security Council today that
the United States committed a ``barbaric crime'' in shooting down
an Iranian airliner and denied U.S. claims that the Navy warned the
jetliner before the attack.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali-Akbar Velayati, in an angry speech,
accused the United States of a premeditated attack on the airliner
with 290 people aboard and demanded the withdrawal of U.S. forces
from the Persian Gulf.
   ``This was the most inhuman military attack in the history of
civil aviation,'' he said.
   He accused the United States of ``arrogance, indifference and a
campaign of lies ... to justify this barbaric crime at any cost...
   ``This was a premeditated act of aggression against the
integrity of Tehran ... a massacre,'' he said.
   Vice President George Bush called the accident a ``terrible
human tragedy'' but told the Security Council that Iran shares the
responsibility.
   ``The critical issue is not the how and why of Iran Air 655,''
Bush said. ``It is the continuing refusal of the government of Iran
to comply with (a U.N. cease-fire resolution), to negotiate an end
to the war with Iraq and to cease its acts of aggression against
neutral shipping in the Persian Gulf.''
   He said Iran ``allowed a civilian aircraft loaded with
passengers to proceed on a path over a warship engaged in battle.
That was irresponsible and a tragic error.''
   The meeting was requested by Iran, which sought a condemnation
of the United States. It adjourned after Velayati and Bush spoke
and was scheduled to resume Friday.
   Iran also sought a condemnation of the United States from the
governing council of the International Civil Aviation Organization.
The council agreed today in Montreal that the world body should
investigate the incident, but only four of the 33 members _ China,
the Soviet Union, Cuba and Czechoslovakia _ spoke in favor of U.S
condemnation.
   Diplomats said the 15-member Security Council was not in
agreement on a resolution or statement that would be acceptable to
all parties and would not be vetoed by the United States. As one of
the council's five permanent members, the United States has veto
power.
   Velayati quoted the radio transcript of recordings between
Flight 655 and control towers and said it shows that, contrary to
the U.S. version, the plane never received warnings from the
Vincennes on July 3.
   ``It was traveling in an established civilian air corridor and
transmitting an internationally recognized signal to identify
itself ... Claiming mistaken identity is absurd,'' Velayati said.
   He rebutted U.S. claims that the plane was descending in an
attack mode, that it was transmitting ambiguous civilian and
military signals and that it was outside a recognized air corridor.
   The Navy said the cruiser's crew mistook the A300 Airbus for a
fighter jet and the plane ignored radioed warnings.
   Velayati said the council should compel the United States and
all foreign forces to leave the gulf.``Anything less would be a
further evasion of responsibilitry by the Security Council.''
   The appearance of Bush, a former U.N. ambassador, was considered
a major gesture of hopes for better relations with Iran after
nearly nine years of hostility. A U.S. vice president has not
addressed the council in years.
   Bush was U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under former
President Richard Nixon from 1971 to 1973. This is believed to be
his first appearance at the U.N. since. President Reagan has
appeared six times.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater denied any political
motivation for the appearance by Bush, the presumed Republican
presidential nominee.
   ``The vice president does not normally appear before the
Security Council and in this way we can again highlight our
position,'' Fitzwater said.
   The United States already has expressed deep regret for the
attack and promised compensation to the families of the victims,
but not to the Iranian government.
   The United States broke diplomatic relations with Iran in
November 1979 after Iranian revolutionaries stormed the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran and took Americans hostage, holding them for more
than a year.
   But both Iran and the United States clearly want to avoid a
bitter public confrontation in the Security Council, and both sides
have been restrained in their statements here and elsewhere.
   The United States has backed off from its call for the council
to impose a mandatory, global arms embargo against Iran.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz has said that before the
airliner was shot down, Iranian officials had sent probes about
opening a dialogue with the United States.
   In Tehran, the No. 2 leader, Parliament Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani, has urged moderation and restraint and opposed violent
retaliation for the U.S. attack. He previously has said Iran must
stop offending the international community, end its isolation and
gain political friends and trading partners.

<HEAD>While Farmers Suffer in Drought, Retailers Benefit From
Hot-Weather Sales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The hot, dry weather that has caused grief for
many U.S. farmers proved to be a boon for the nation's retailers in
June as consumers rushed to purchase items ranging from summer
clothes to air conditioners.
   The Commerce Department said Thursday that retail sales rose a
moderate 0.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted $132.8 billion last
month. It said sales rose 0.3 in May, an upward revision from the
previous estimate of 0.1 percent.
   Much of the strength in June came at department stores and other
general merchandise outlets, where sales jumped 1.87 percent to
$15.2 billion, the strongest gain since last August, when the
increase was 1.94 percent.
   In a report last week, major department stores had reported
strong sales of air conditioners, summer clothes, barbecue
equipment and sporting goods.
   ``I think what we're seeing is the upside of the current weather
situation,'' said James Newton, head of Economic Perspectives Inc.,
a Delaware, Ohio, consulting firm.
   ``In the short term, the heat is helping boost sales of all
kinds of things: lawn furniture, sprinkling systems. ... Also, by
this time, generally retailers would be heavily marking down summer
clothing. They haven't had to do that,'' Newton said.
   Automotive sales also were strong, posting a 1.2 percent gain to
$29.7 billion. They had been off 0.8 percent in May and 1.1 percent
in April.
   Excluding autos, the June sales increase was 0.3 percent, down
from a 0.6 percent gain in May.
   Offsetting increases at auto showrooms and department stores
were declines in two areas linked to the housing market, which has
been softening this year.
   Sales of building supply materials and hardware dropped 1.0
percent and furniture sales were off 0.5 percent.
   Overall, analysts said the moderate June increase should ease
fears in the financial markets that a too-strong economy poses the
danger of inflation.
   ``This is confirmation that consumers certainly haven't
retrenched to a serious degree,'' said Sandra Shaber, an economist
with the Futures Group in Washington. ``But on the other hand
there's no sign that consumers are going to heat up prices.''
   For the first six months of the year, overall sales were up 6.4
percent over the same period a year ago. However, excluding autos,
first half sales were up only 4.6 percent, barely ahead of the 4.4
percent consumer inflation rate for January through May.
   ``Real retail sales, adjusting for increases in the prices of
consumer goods, have really been extremely flat,'' said David Levy
of Levy Economic Forecasts of Chappaqua, N.Y. ``The retail sector
is one of the weakest sectors in the economy right now.''
   Sales of durable goods _ the ``big ticket'' items expected to
last more than three years _ were up 0.5 percent. Sales of
non-durable goods rose 0.6 percent.
   There was gains of 1.6 percent at specialty clothing stores, 0.4
percent at restaurants and bars and 0.3 percent at gasoline
stations.
   Food and grocery store sales were down 0.4 percent, a surprise
to some economists who expected drought-related price increases to
inflate sales figures. Drug store sales were down 0.5 percent.

<HEAD>GM Introducing New Safety Steering Wheel on 1989 Cavalier</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILFORD, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Economy-car buyers will be the first to
benefit from a less expensive safety innovation developed by
General Motors Corp. _ a steering wheel that flattens itself
against the driver's torso in an accident.
   GM President Robert Stempel said Wednesday that GM is
introducing its new self-aligning steering wheel on the 1989
Chevrolet Cavalier. The device will be phased in later on other
cars not equipped with more expensive airbags.
   The wheel is a hollow hub on six metal tabs that collapse on
impact, distributing the force evenly and reducing the potential
for head and chest injuries, the automaker said.
   Most cars equipped with airbags have tended to be more expensive
models because economy car buyers are less willing to pay the cost
of an airbag, Stempel said.
   Spokeswoman Jane Mott said today GM would not divulge how much
the steering wheels or airbags would add to the cost.
   Automakers are required by the federal government to have
passive restraints _ either driver-side airbags in addition to
manual shoulder-lap belts or automatic shoulder belts _ by 1990.
   GM, the nation's No. 1 automaker, will include driver-side
airbags as standard equipment on 500,000 middle- and upper-range
cars a year by 1990, Stempel said.
   Stempel said GM won't begin including passenger-side airbags as
standard equipment until 1992 because the technology is still being
developed.
   He said passenger-side airbags are harder to position because
passengers tend to sit in a variety of postures, especially in
larger cars.

   Watering the lawn in Plymouth can mean a ticket.
Boaters on Pennsylvania's Allegheny River are warned to watch out
for underwater hazards in increasingly shallow water. Egg farmers
are selling birds for slaughter because of rising feed prices.
   The Northeast is suffering through a dry spell that compares in
some spots to the Midwestern drought.
   ``Peas have essentially been taken off the market,'' said Don
Geise, a field man at Furman's, a Northumberland County, Pa., farm
where nearly 85 percent of the pea crop was stunted by the drought.
   Pennsylvania drought damage has approached the level of the
parched Midwest: 95 percent of its farmers report inadequate soil
moisture, 86 percent of pasture land is below average, 23 percent
of the soybean crop is rated poor or very poor.
   Pennsylvania issued a drought watch this month calling for a
voluntary 5 percent reduction in water consumption. Rainfall in the
Philadelphia area _ where the temperature has hit 100 degrees three
times already _ is about 7 inches off the average for this time of
year of 20.55 inches.
   Farmers in western Massachusetts report up to 75 percent losses
of peas and 25 percent failures of green peppers. All five acres of
one grower's eggplant crop were destroyed and another lost his
small carrot crop.
   What's a farmer to do?
   ``I don't know _ keep irrigating and hope, pray,'' said Scott
Danner, sales coordinator for the Pioneer Valley Growers
Association in Whately, Mass., a 66-farm cooperative.
   The Midwestern drought has raised the price of poultry feed in
the Northeast by 30 percent.
   ``Feed has been as high as I've ever seen it and I've been in
business 35 years,'' said John Ricca, president of Westminster Egg
Farms in Westminster, Mass., whose 560,000 birds lay about 200,000
dozen eggs a week.
   The price of a ton of feed _ made of soybean and corn, two
hard-hit Midwestern crops _ that cost $130 last year now sells for
$200. Ricca said he has begun selling birds for slaughter earlier
than normal to reduce production.
   In the driest summer in Connecticut since 1910, about 600 acres
of state woodland have burned in the past week. Gov. William A.
O'Neill banned open fires in or within 100 yards of brush, forests
or grass fields _ the state's first such summer ban.
   More than 5,000 acres of forest have burned in the Palisades
Interstate Park complex in New York and New Jersey, according to
the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation,
closing down more than 350 miles of trails.
   Corn plants in Connecticut are about three feet shorter than
normal, said David T. Schreiber, executive director of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's stabilization and conservation service
in Windsor, Conn. State officials have received reports of dried
out pumpkins, small tomatoes and hard fruit.
   Just 0.77 inches of rain has fallen since July 1 in
Massachusetts, far below the monthly average of 3.94 inches. The
water level in the state's main reservoir has fallen 13 feet below
normal, leaving the state supply at 76 percent of capacity.
   In Plymouth _ one of 31 Massachusetts communities to declare
water emergencies _ officials have handed out 150 citations to
people who have ignored lawn watering restrictions. A handful of
second offenders have been fined $25.
   ``We're trying our damnedest to make these people understand the
seriousness of the problem,'' said Leighton Peck, public works
director in the town of 45,000.
   But compared to other sections on the country, Northeast growers
remain sanguine.
   ``It's hard to say `drought' when you look at the Midwest
crops,'' said Danner of the Massachusetts cooperative. ``It all
comes down to what you consider a drought. I'd say we're in a
severe water shortage.''

   Georgia schools must provide sex education
courses beginning in the first grade and AIDS education beginning
in the sixth grade, the state Board of Education decided Thursday.
   The board approved the Quality Core Curriculum, a revision that
will bring the schools into compliance with a 1988 law making sex
education mandatory. It currently is left to school districts'
discretion.
   The law stipulates courses must stress abstinence, although the
QCC language gives school systems the option of teaching methods of
contraception in grades nine through 12.
   AIDS education will begin in the sixth grade with instruction on
communicable diseases. The instruction is to emphasize abstinence
from sex and drugs as the best prevention.
   The law gives parents the right to prevent their children from
participating in sex education courses.
   ``It's a monumental step for Georgia and in the nation because
we are one of the first states in the nation to have a
state-mandated curriculum,'' said Peyton Williams, associate
superintendent for instruction. ``We are excited about the equity
it will provide in classrooms around the state.''
   School districts will be required to adhere to the QCC as it is
phased in over a period of years.
   State officials will encourage teachers to begin adhering to the
guidelines this fall, but the full curriculum will be phased in
over five years when textbooks and other materials are reordered.

<HEAD>Doctor Dies During Surgery; Leaves Rural Area Without OB Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNION SPRINGS, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two poor, rural counties with some of
the nation's highest infant mortality rates have no one to deliver
babies after their only obstetrician-gynecologist died while
performing surgery.
   The death of Dr. Robert X. Williams has forced the only public
hospital in Bullock and Macon counties to refer women in labor to
Montgomery hospitals 40 miles away, the administrator of Bullock
County Hospital, Duane Brookhart, said Thursday.
   ``The loss of a physician is going to reduce access to health
care, particularly for the poor who can't afford to travel long
distances for medical care,'' said Jim McVay, spokesman for the
state Department of Public Health.
   At least 27 of Alabama's 67 counties are without a hospital
providing obstetrical services, according to the Alabama Hospital
Association.
   Williams, 54, collapsed with a massive heart attack and was
pronounced dead in the operating room at the hospital in Union
Springs on Wednesday morning, officials said.
   He had nearly completed a hysterectomy when he died. St.
Margaret's Hospital in Montgomery used its emergency helicopter to
fly Dr. Judi Jehle to Union Springs to complete the surgery, which
was done without complications, hospital spokeswoman Cathy Ellis
said Thursday.
   ``The patient was given a spinal (anesthesia) and she was awake
during the entire thing,'' Ms. Jehle said. ``When I got there ...
she seemed pretty calm, but she watched the whole thing.''
   Because of Williams' death, ``we have had to cease OB
delivery,'' the hospital adminsitrator said.
   Williams was the only obstetrician in the two-county area and
delivered 30 to 50 babies a month. He had delivered several babies
Tuesday, ``and I could tell from his on-call room he had been at
the hospital all night,'' Ms. Jehle said. ``When I left, one of the
nurses shook her head and said, `He worked himself to death.'''
   Ms. Jehle said it was ironic she was called in to complete the
surgery because she recently decided to give up the obstetrical
part of her partice because of the long hours. She said Williams
had been scheduled to leave on a cruise this weekend to celebrate
his 32nd anniversary.
   A family physician in Macon County, Arvind Patel, also has been
delivering babies at Bullock County Hospital, but he can't because
there is no longer a surgeon on call in case a Caesarean section is
needed, Brookhart said.
   When Williams' died, two women were at the hospital in labor,
but they were transferred by ambulance to Montgomery, where they
delivered. No women had been transferred Thursday, Brookhart said.
   The hospital administrator said he already is working to recruit
another physician.
   ``This is a relatively poor area. A lot of the patients are
Medicaid and uninsured. With all the other liabilities an
obstetrician faces, it is hard to recruit,'' he said.
   In 1986, Alabama had the highest infant mortality rate of any
state, with 13.3 out of every 1,000 babies dying before their first
birthday. In 1987, it dropped to 12.2, but complete national
statistics are not yet available for comparison.
   McVay said Bullock and Macon counties ``have traditionally had
one of the highest levels of infant mortality in the state.''
   Bullock County's rate was 26.2 in 1986 and 5.1 in 1987, although
that figure was skewed by a small number of births. Macon County's
rate was 12.6 in 1986 and 15.9 in 1987, he said.

   The landmark RCA Building _ a 70-story art deco
tower at the heart of Rockefeller Center _ is being renamed the GE
Building after the company that bought RCA and its network TV
division, NBC, two years ago.
   NBC President Robert Wright announced the decision in a memo to
employees Wednesday.
   ``It seems sort of the obvious evolution of things,'' said NBC
spokeswoman Betty Hudson.
   The RCA Building is a popular tourist spot for its swank Rainbow
Room restaurant, observation deck and NBC studios, where ``The
Today Show,'' ``Saturday Night Live,'' and ``Late Night With David
Letterman'' are taped.
   The building is owned by Rockefeller Center, but General
Electric has the right to change the name it's had for more than
five decades.
   Five blocks away is another landmark known as the General
Electric Building. It was once known as the RCA Victor Building
before GE moved in in 1933.

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews June 22-July 2 with 1,223 adults in
the continental United States. The phone numbers were selected
randomly by computer and interviews were conducted with the adult
who had the most recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning that if
every adult American were asked the same questions, the results
theoretically would be within three points of the poll's results,
19 times out of 20. The error margin is larger for subgroups _ four
points, for example, for those who say they have made their choice
for president.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and

<HEAD>Suspect Free on Bail in Shooting of Paralyzed 6-year-old</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 6-year-old boy told his father he wanted a
skateboard as his reward for surviving a stray bullet, fired in
what police believe was a drug-related shooting.
   But Ralph Brooks Jr. may never walk again, let alone ride a
skateboard, due to the .45-caliber slug now lodged just below his
heart, doctors said Thursday.
   John Templeton, pediatric surgeon at The Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia, said the bullet passed through the boy's spine before
stopping half an inch from his heart. He is paralyzed from the
waist down.
   Doctors who praised the boy's stamina said they would not remove
the bullet unless complications developed because of the risks
related to surgery that close to the heart.
   Police said the child apparently was caught in the cross-fire of
a shootout Tuesday that may have been part of a feud between drug
dealers.
   Police said witnesses told them Lonnie Summers, 21, fired
several shots at a passing car and one of them hit the boy. Summers
was arrested on charges of aggravated and simple assault,
recklessly endangering another person and violating the uniform
firearms act, police said.
   He was arraigned Wednesday and released on $10,000 bail,
officials said.
   Ralph was playing with one of his two sisters when the shooting
occurred.
   ``They shoot out there every day, two or three times a day,''
said Lula Carr, a 30-year-resident of the south Philadelphia
neighborhood. ``You stay in your house and you just try not to get
involved.''
   Bernadine Collins rushed outside when shots rang out Tuesday, to
where her children and grandchildren had been sitting, 20 yards
from Ralph.
   ``It's just another repeat of what happens all the time,'' she
said. ``It's not going to stop ... and this was only a ... baby. I
never knew a bullet could travel so far.''
   The boy's parents, Kimberly and Ralph Sr., said they held little
hope that their son's shooting would stop the drug dealers or
drug-related violence.
   ``This has happened so many times,'' Brooks said. ``I don't
think they feel like we feel.''
   The Philadelphia Daily News has established a trust fund to help
finance Ralph's education.

<HEAD>Drought Shifts East, Little Relief in Sight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The focus of the drought plaguing much of the
nation has shifted eastward, but little relief is in sight for most
areas, the National Weather Service reported Thursday.
   The new short-range forecast through next Monday calls for hot,
dry weather to expand eastward from the Rockies through the Ohio
Valley to the Mid-Atlantic states.
   Rapidly moving weather systems are expected to drag weak fronts
along the U.S.-Canadian border, possibly triggering scattered
showers in the extreme northern Plains and upper Mississippi
Valley. The heavy rain which has hit portions of Texas is expected
to diminish.
   Long-term drought conditions now cover a large area of the Great
Lakes region and the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, the agency's
Climate Analysis Center reported.
   In addition, drought conditions persist over large areas of the
northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountains.
   A 30-day weather forecast issued Wednesday held little hope for
improvement. And a separate climate assessment added that many
areas now experiencing extreme drought have less than a 4 percent
chance of recovering from the drought within 3 months.
   At the beginning of July, 29 percent of the nation was
undergoing severe or extreme drought, the agency said.
   On Tuesday, the Agriculture Department announced sharp
reductions in the anticipated harvest of many crops because of the
water shortage _ and those projections were based on the assumption
of normal weather from here on, according to department officials.
   The new National Weather Service forecasts cast a dark cloud
over that assumption.
   The drought region now extends well into West Virginia and
includes nearly all of Ohio and Indiana and much of Kentucky and
Tennessee, the weather service drought advisory said. On the other
hand, western portions of the Mississippi Valley have received some
relief due to recent rains.
   The drought has been accompanied by higher than normal
temperatures over much of the nation, most notably over the western
Great Lakes region.
   The national picture shows the current drought to be about
equivalent to that of 1911, and still somewhat less severe than in
several years in the 1930s or 1956. However, in the Midwest, the
weather service reported that large areas have experienced the
driest April-June period on record since 1895.
   Recent rains have resulted in local flooding in Texas, but
nationally streamflows are below normal, and even in Texas are
expected to fall back to below average levels. Flows in many major
rivers remain low and continue to restrict navigation.
   Reservoir levels remain close to average in much of the nation,
however, the weather service noted.
   In addition to Thursday's short-range forecast, the medium-range
outlook through July 23 anticipates much of the nation will remain
hotter than normal, particularly the Tennessee Valley, lower
Midwest, central and northern Great Plains, northern Rockies and
Great Basin. The only areas escaping heat in the forecast are the
nation's northwestern and northeastern corners and the
Louisiana-Texas-New Mexico area.
   Most of the hot area is expected to be drier than normal,
although some significant rain could penetrate northwestward from
Texas into New Mexico, Colorado and eastern Wyoming.

   After 13 years of tearful prayers, two
Vietnamese sisters were reunited with their parents and six
siblings, who worked side by side in a small restaurant to buy the
girls' freedom.
   ``Our great dream has come true,'' a beaming Nguyen Van Trieu,
54, said Thursday at the family's restaurant, Kim's Coffee Shop.
   Van Trieu and his wife, Thi Khanh, last saw the two girls,
My-Chi, 20, and My-Hanh, 15, in Saigon on April 30, 1975, the day
the South Vieefore I die.' He's granted that, that's for
sure,'' he said.
   Tired from their journey, the daughters smiled shyly and
repeated the word ``happy'' as their parents detailed the family's
exodus.
   The couple fled with their oldest child, Kymberly, now 26,
leaving two sons and four daughters behind.
   Van Trieu, a military officer in South Vietnam, fled with
thousands of others from his country to avoid punishment from the
communists.
   The three were taken to a refugee camp in Arkansas, where they
spent several months learning English and waiting for an American
sponsor. In the fall of 1975, they were befriended by a church in
Memphis, Tenn., and, refusing welfare, worked at various odd jobs.
   The family sent thousands of dollars to Vietnam to pay bribes
and buy transportation for their children's freedom. Two daughters
and a son were allowed to leave Vietnam in 1980, and two years
later, another son was released.
   In 1982, the Nguyens opened their restaurant with $20,000
borrowed from friends. Living in an adjoining house, the entire
family worked without pay, preparing meals, waiting on tables and
washing dishes, as they continued sending money to Vietnam for the
release of the two remaining children.
   Except for letters and a few snapshots, the family had had no
contact with My-Chi and My-Hanh, who lived with their 87-year-old
maternal grandmother.
   It wasn't until June that the family learned permission had been
granted for My-Chi and My-Hanh to leave.
   ``We had hope,'' My-Chi said in Vietnamese. ``We're sleeping
here, but we still think we're in Vietnam.''
   The grandmother was supposed to come too, but at the last minute
decided she wanted to die in her homeland, Van Trieu said.
   Fearing last-minute complications, Van Trieu refused to believe
his daughters were free until he greeted them at Greater Pittsburgh
International Airport on Wednesday night, nine days after they left
Saigon, now known as Ho Chi Minh City. There had been no official
confirmation from the Vietnamese government that the two had been
allowed to leave as scheduled July 4.
   The Nguyens immediately recognized My-Chi and My-Hanh, who were
7 and 2 when the family was separated. The girls knew their parents
through photographs, but they had never before met their youngest
sister, Beatrice Ann, 12, who was born in the United States.
   ``We get along real good,'' Kymberly said. ``We thought there
would be a lot of differences and stuff like that. But it just
seems like old times.''
   The family celebrated with a party at their restaurant for
family and friends that continued into the morning. On Thursday,
Thi Khanh took her daughters shopping for clothes and on a tour of
their new hometown.
   Both girls plan to earn high school diplomas while, of course,
helping at the restaurant.
   ``We have a lot of blessings,'' Van Trieu said. ``All my family
is here. That's not a dream. That's a blessing.''

   France's most-watched television network, TF1, says
it will broadcast its main evening newscast live from Atlanta on

Convention.
   The network said anchorman Patrick Poivre d'Arvor will present a

Dukakis and a series of reports prepared by the network's

   Because of the time difference, the 8 p.m. newscast will

<HEAD>Exotic Dancing, and Without Fear of Official Interference</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nude dancing will be one of Atlanta's attractions
that visiting Democrats may choose to experience next week, without
fear of official interference.
   Chances that Atlanta's nude dancing clubs might have to shut
down prior to the Democratic National Convention fizzled Wednesday
when a judge delayed until next month a second round of hearings on
the constitutionality of a new state law banning the sale of
alcohol in such clubs.
   Fulton County Superior Court Judge Isaac Jenrette scheduled an
evidentiary hearing for Aug. 12 on The Gold Club's challenge to the
law. A temporary restraining order issued June 30 will continue to
bar enforcement of the law until Jenrette issues his ruling.
   The challenge now goes to Jenrette rather than directly to the
Georgia Supreme Court because Judge Luther Alverson, who issued the
temporary restraining order as presiding judge for the week,
refused to grant the state's request for a certificate of immediate
review.
   Alverson, who blocked enforcement of the law with an opinion
that it violated the state Constitution, later modified his ruling
to stress that it was temporary after lawyers from the attorney
general's office complained that they had not been given an
opportunity to offer evidence and examine witnesses.

<HEAD>Third Party Candidate Says City Hid Its Homeless</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A third-party presidential candidate charged that
Atlanta city officials attempted to hide their homeless problem by
moving indigents from shacks under a viaduct near the Democratic
National Convention site into cheap apartments.
   ``The ramshackle, unsafe apartments (the homeless) were given
are meant to be temporary _ just long enough to keep this `eyesore'
from spoiling the sights for the convention delegates,'' Lenora B.
Fulani, candidate of the New Alliance Party, said Wednesday.
   Ms. Fulani, a developmental psychologist from New York, will be
the first woman placed on the ballot in all 50 states and the
District of Columbia for the Nov. 8 election. She is the first
black woman to receive federal matching campaign funds.
   Speaking on the steps of Atlanta City Hall, Ms. Fulani urged the
homeless to register and vote to assert their political rights.
   ``I believe that the solution to homelessness is an independent,
black-led and multiracialulti-racial third party in America that
stands for people instead of profits,'' she said.
   On Monday, city officials moved 16 homeless people from plywood
shacks and underground tunnels to apartments. Officials said the
move was for safety and security. They pledged to provide the
apartments only for 30 days.

<TEXT>
   The opposition on Thursday refused to
recognize the official returns proclaiming Carlos Salinas de
Gortari winner of the presidential election and pledged a
nationwide protest campaign.
   Final results released Wednesday night by the Federal Election
Commission, a week after the polls closed, gave Salinas the victory
by the slimmest margin in the 59 years the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, has controlled Mexico.
   The opposition also won Senate seats for the first time, taking
four out of 64.
   The PRI-dominated election commission said Salinas received 9.64
million votes, or 50.36 percent, far below the 70 percent level
that was the minimum victory level for the governing party
presidential candidate in the past.
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist National Democratic Front was
second with 5.96 million, or 31.12 percent; and Manuel J. Clouthier
of the conservative National Action Party was third with 3.27
million votes or 17.07 percent. Two minor candidates accounted for
the rest of the vote.
   Of 38 million registered voters, 50.3 percent cast ballots, the
commission said. Government and party officials initially described
the turnout as larger than the 75 percent in 1982 and blamed a
heavy turnout for the slow vote count.
   Cardenas, 54, son of the late President Lazaro Cardenas who is
one of the most revered Mexican leaders, announced plans to tour
the country next week after calling his supporters to a protest
march Saturday in the downtown Zocalo plaza.
   He said he would target regions where he considers ``fraud was
the most brutal and ran roughshod on our party members.''
   Cardenas broke from the PRI last year and united the normally
fragmented left to leap ahead of the conservative National Action
Party as one of the country's to largest opposition group.
   Clouthier, 54, planned to start his protest rallies Thursday
afternoon in Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city, then tour
northern Mexico where his party has its strongholds until July 23.
   Opposition representatives on the commission accused it of fraud
and said the release of the vote totals was delayed so they could
be doctored.
   ``It appears that there are two Mexicos,'' said Jorge Amador, a
National Democratic Front supporter on the commission.
   He said there is a modern Mexico where the federal electoral
code is respected, honest results are posted and the victorious
candidate is Cardenas, and a second, backward Mexico ``in which the
federal electoral code is not known, is not applied'' and the
popular will is thwarted.
   Amador's aides carried into the commission boxes of ballots,
some of them partially burned and others he said they found in the
streets.
   ``It is now the task of all the competing political parties to
accept the basic principle of democracy,'' Interior Secretary
Manuel Bartlett, the commission's leader, said at the meeting.
``Accept the majority verdict of the people in the terms and
proportions with which it was expressed.''
   The PRI has not lost a presidential or Senate race or
gubernatorial election in any of Mexico's 31 states since its
founding in 1929.
   Salinas, who proclaimed his victory the day after the balloting
and has been receiving congratulations from the major organizations
making up his party throughout the week, planned to meet Thursday
with all Mexico's governors.
   The Harvard-educated economist was President Miguel de la
Madrid's budget secretary for five years until his nomination last
fall as the PRI's candidate. He promises modernization and
political reforms will mark his six-year term.
   Cardenas, Clouthier and fifth-place finisher Rosario Ibarra de
Piedra of the radical Revolutionary Workers Party have said they
will not recognize the winner of a fradulent election.
   ``We will not permit an electoral fraud to continue and for a
usurping government to take power,'' Cardenas said Wednesday night.
   The long wait for the final count gave rise to widespread
speculation that the outcome was being altered.
   It was not yet known whether the PRI lost the two-thirds
majority required for approval of constitutional reforms in the
Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Congress.
   The PRI won 249 of the 300 directly elected seats in the Chamber
of Deputies, the lower house of Congress. The National Action Party
took 31 and parties supporting Cardenas took 20.
   The remaining 200 seats in the chamber are assigned on the basis
of proportion of the vote received, so the PRI will retain its
majority. But it was not known how many of the 200 seats it would
get.
   Salinas has said he preferred a smaller but more credible
victory to the PRI's traditional overwhelming margin.
   The results gave 60 Senate seats to the PRI and four to parties
supporting Cardenas, two from the Federal District that is the core
of the Mexico City metropolitan area and two from his home state of
Michoacan.

<HEAD>Rohatyn, Market Experts Call for Regulatory Changes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investment banker Felix G. Rohatyn and a panel
of financial experts called on Congress Thursday to enact
legislation designed to stiffen government regulation of the stock
index futures markets.
   But the bill, introduced last week by Rep. Edward Markey,
D-Mass., drew a wary response from several members of the House
telecommunications and finance subcommittee, of which Markey is
chairman. Markey conceded the measure may not have a chance until
next year.
   Rohatyn, an advisor to the prospective Democratic presidential
candidate, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, went beyond voicing
support for Markey's bill, which would empower the Securities and
Exchange Commission to regulate index futures, now overseen by the
Commodity Fsutures Trading Commission.
   Rohatyn suggested a series of taxes and other measures that he
said would dampen speculation by large institutional investors
controlling billions of dollars, including pension funds, insurance
companies, banks and other government-backed entities.
   ``The fundamental weakness in the securities markets,
world-wide, is the result of excessive speculation, excessive use
of credit and inadequate regulation,'' Rohatyn said.
   Rohatyn, a partner at Lazard Freres & Co. in New York, said that
market speculation is driven by large institutions, which he said
are ``risking the assets of retirees, depositors, and policy
holders'' and ``also putting the taxpayers at risk.''
   Rohatyn proposed 50 percent taxes on the profits from the sales
of securities held less than one year, reducing capital gains taxes
on securities held more than five years, limiting the types of
investments government-insured institutions could make, and other
changes.
   ``I am aware of the political difficulties of such a program,''
he said. ``I am resigned to the reality that it will not happen
until the next market crisis.''

Council</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mr. President, members of the Council:
   I have come here today to represent the United States, at the
request of President Reagan, because of the importance of the
issues at stake _ not just the terrible human tragedy of Iran Air
655, but the continuing conflict between Iran and Iraq and its
implications for international commerce in the Persian Gulf.
   Having been my country's permanent representative to this body,
I know what a grave responsibility the council bears and the good
it can do when it acts with realism and wisdom. We are in urgent
need of realism and wisdom now.
   Mr. President, the Persian Gulf is a region of vital importance
to the United States and the economy of the world. American and
European forces are in the gulf, with the support of the states of
the area, to meet a vital need _ to help ensure the unimpeded flow
of oil and to keep neutral commerce moving in the face of a very
real threat to innocent shipping. This is our legal right.
   Iranian mines, deliberately sown, have disrupted innocent
passage and damaged unarmed merchant vessals and a U.S. Naval ship
in international waters. Iranian smallboat attacks on
non-belligerent merchant ships continue unabated. These actions are
in blatant violation of international law. They give the lie to
Iran's assertions that it supports freedom of navigation in the
gulf.
   We have increased the size of our forces from traditional levels
to protect U.S.-flag shipping and to assist other neutral vessels
under unlawful attack, when they request assistance. Five European
navies in addition to our own _ a total of some 43 ships _ are now
in the gulf to counter Iran's reckless behavior toward neutral
ships engaged in lawful commerce. I am proud of our leadership in
meeting this challenge.
   Together we have made it clear that we will keep the Persian
Gulf open, no matter what the threat. I am here to reaffirm to
those who depend on us and to those who would threaten us, that we
will not alter this course. Mr. President, the critical issue
confronting this body is not the how and why of Iran Air 655. It is
the continuing refusal of the government of the Islamic Republic of
Iran to comply with Resolution 598, to negotiate an end to the war
with Iraq, and to cease its acts of aggression against neutral
shipping in the Persian Gulf.
   The victims of Iran Air 655 are only the most recent casualties
of a brutal and senseless war that has brought immense pain and
suffering to the people of both sides.
   Iran long ago could have accepted, and can still accept, an
honorable end to the war. As a first step, it should declare its
readiness unequivocally to comply with Resolution 598 _ today, for
the first time, before this body. It can act now to end the
unspeakable sacrifices the people of both Iran and Iraq are being
asked to make. What possible objectives could be worth the human
suffering and pain, the hundreds of thousands of casualties, and
the economic devastation the war has caused on both sides?
   A particularly horrifying aspect of the Iran-Iraq war is the
increasingly routine use of chemical weapons. Who can forget the
pictures of entire families lying dead in the streets of their
villages, innocent of anything, yet killed in this savage way?
   The United States was the first nation publicly to condemn the
use of chemical weapons in the war as a blatant violation of the
Geneva protocols. We fully support Security Council Resolution 612,
which demands an immediate end to chemical warfare by both parties.
No country should think it can use chemical weapons with impunity.
   We respect Iran's right to air its grievances. But Iran cannot
have it both ways. Iran cannot simultaneously complain to this body
and defy it.
   The government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has refused to
say plainly and clearly that it will comply with the mandatory
decision of the Security Council. Iran must not be permitted to
choose those provisions of Resolution 598 it likes and ignore the
others. Nor can Iraq be permitted to rest on verbal adherence to
Resolution 598, while avoiding cooperation with the
secretary-general in finding practical ways to implement the
resolution.
   As for the immediate matter at hand _ the unfortunate
destruction of Iran Air 655 _ many of the circumstances remain
unclear. Our own military investigation is under way. We will also
cooperate with any investigation that is conducted by the
International Civil Aviation Organization, and we trust that the
government of Iran will do the same. We want all the relevant facts
to be brought to light as quickly as possible.
   But one thing is clear: The U.S.S. Vincennes acted in
self-defense.
   This tragic accident occurred against a backdrop of repeated,
unjustified, unprovoked, and unlawful Iranian attacks against U.S.
merchant shipping and armed forces, beginning with the mine attack
on the USS Bridgeton in July 1987. It occurred in the midst of a
naval attack initiated by Iranian vessels against a neutral vessel
and, subsequently, against the Vincennes when it came to the aid of
the innocent ship in distress.
   Despite these hostilities, Iranian authorities failed to divert
Iran Air 655 from the area. They allowed a civilian aircraft loaded
with passengers to proeed on a path over a warship engaged in
battle. That was irresponsible and a tragic error.

<HEAD>UNITED NATIONS: tragic error.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The information available to Captain Will Rogers, the captain of
the Vincennes, indicated that an Iranian military aircraft was
approaching his ship with hostile intentions. After seven
unanswered warnings, he did what he had to do to protect his ship
and the lives of his crew. As a military commander, his first duty
and responsibility is to protect his men and his ship.
   The United States has never willfully acted to endanger innocent
civilians, nor will it ever. But I can also assure you that the
United States will never put its military in a dangerous situation
and deny them the right to defend themselves.
   Mr. President, we are all accustomed by now to hearing
irresponsible charges from the Iranian government. There have been
many particularly egregious statements concerning this tragic
incident.
   I will not dignify with a response the charge that we
deliberately destroyed Iran Air 655. The Foreign Minister of Iran
knows better. He knows that this tragedy was an accident. He also
knows that by allowing a civilian airliner to fly into the area of
an engagement between Iranian warships and U.S. forces in the gulf,
Iran must bear a substantial measure of responsibility for what has
happened.
   I call on Iran today to reroute civilian air traffic away from
areas of active hostilities. Yesterday, the U.S. representative to
the International Civil Aviation Organization advocated an
investigation by the ICAO into the Iran Air incident and immediate
consideration of appropriate measures to ensure the safety of civil
aviation in the gulf.
   Mr. President, the terrible disaster of Iran Air 655 fills our
hearts with sorrow. Our reaction to this tragedy transcends
political differences and boundaries. As Americans, we share the
grief of the families of the victims, whatever their nationalities.
   It is that strongly felt sense of common humanity that has led
our government to decide that the United States will provide
voluntary, ex gratia compensation to the families of those who died
in the crash of Iran Air 655.
   We make this offer as a humanitarian gesture _ not as a matter
of legal obligation but out of a sense of moral compassion,
reflecting the value we place on human life. We hope that
compensation will help ease the pain of those who have suffered a
loss, even as we recognize that nothing we can do or say can ever
bring back their loved ones.
   In the case of Iranian victims, we will take appropriate measure
to ensure that the money flows directly to the families and not to
the government: We will provide none of these funds to the
government of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Indeed, we will provide
no compensation until mechanisms are in place to ensure that the
money goes only to the families of the victims.
   Mr. President, the time has come, indeed the time is long past,
for us to rededicate ourselves to the cause of peace. The Iran Air
tragedy should reinforce our determination to act. It should remind
those who would prefer fo ignore the terrible human cost of the
Iran-Iraq war and the threat it poses to the security of the
Persian Gulf _ those who find reasons to delay rather than reasons
to act for peace _ that their complacency carries a heavy price.
   The United States has one overreaching goal in the Persian Gulf.
That goal is peace. Peace means cessation of the killing. Peace
means total freedom of passage through the straits _ total freedom
of ships to sail without risk in international waters. Peace also
means nations living without the fear of threats or intimidation
from their neighbors.
   To this end, we will continue to defend our interests and
support our friends, while remaining steadfastly neutral in the
war. As long as this conflict continues, we and other Western
nations will work to contain the threat to freedom of navigation
and peaceful commerce in a waterway that is vital to the economies
of the world. Our naval presence is welcomed by peaceful nations
and is a threat to no one. But we will respond firmly if we are
threatened.
   The implementation of Resolution 598 would enable the united
States to return to the modest naval presence in the gulf we have
maintained for more that 40 years, with the support of the gulf
states. It would also create new opportunities for a broader
international role, perhaps under the auspices of the United
Nations, to protect international commerce in the gulf. We look
forward to that day.
   But make no mistake: Until that day, we will do whatever it
takes to maintain freedom of navigation in this vital area of the
world, and to take whatever actions we must to protect our forces
there. We will not let down our friends and allies. We will not be
intimidated by reckless attacks or terror. Our commitment to
freedom and peace demands this and nothing less from the United
States of America.
   Thank you very much.

   Fourteen nurses who specialize in caring for
AIDS patients were honored Thursday in ceremonies at the Department
of Health and Human Services.
   ``I don't think the American public realizes the strain that
AIDS has placed on our health care system, especially in those
cities with the highest rates of infection and the largest number
of cases,'' Said Dr. Robert E. Windom, the assistant HHS secretary
for health.
   He said the strain is not just financial, but on ``personnel
resources.''
   ``And by personnel resources, I mean nurses because it is the
nurses who give AIDS patients the warm, caring attention that makes
all the difference when you are ill,'' said Windom.
   ``When it comes to public recognition of this devotion to duty,
nurses have not had even one hand clapping,'' he said. ``That isn't
right. I've been a physician for 30 years and in my opinion nurses
deserve a standing ovation from the entire nation.''
   Windom said each of the 14 deserved to be singled out, but
emphasized that they ``are symbols for all of the nurses in our
country, so many of whom are equally deserving of public
recognition for the work they are doing.''
   He said he hoped the awards would ``help serve as a candle to
light the way for those young people who want a meaningful
profession to consider nursing as a career.''
   Coincidental with the awards ceremony, the department's newly
formed Commission on Nursing issued its first report _ concluding
that while the number of registered nurses in the United States is
at an all time high, the demand outstrips the supply.
   ``The commission has found that the situation for nurses and for
our health care system is serious and will require the attention
and concentrated efforts of all of us in the health care field,''
said Carolyne K. Davis, a nurse who heads the commission.
   The commission, formed in January, will make recommendations for
action in a later report.
   Meanwhile, it said, ``Nurses represent a bargain and hospitals
are too often using nurses to do the work of other employees,
especially as cutbacks occur among less highly trained personnel.''
   The report said a majority of hospitals are relying on overtime
work by registered nurses ``to staff their units adequately.''
   The nurses receiving awards from Windom were:
   Carol Price, Visiting Nurse Association of Brooklyn, N.Y.
   Mary Boland, director of AIDS nursing at Children's Hospital of
New Jersey, Newark, N.J.
   Barbara Russell, Baptist Hospital, Miami.
   Tracey Castleman, Kansas University Medical Center, Kansas City,
Kan.
   Christine Grady, Nancy L. Sears and Rose V. Thomas, all of the
National Institutes of Health in Rockville, Md.
   Terry Miles, St. Clare's Hospital, New York City.
   JoAnne Bennett, clinical consultant, Gay Men's Health Crisis,
New York City.
   Dorothy Ward-Wimmer, Children's Hospital National Medical
Center, Washington.
   Brenda L. Staton, D.C. General Hospital, Washington.
   Clifford l. Morrison, Robert Wood Johnson AIDS Health Services
Program, San Francisco.
   Helen Miramontes, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, Santa Clara,
Calif., and Valley Medical Center, San Jose, Calif.
   Helen Schietinger, director of AIDS education and training,

   A pair of consumer groups announced Thursday
they will begin surveying supermarket prices in an effort to call
attention to any unjustified increases during the drought.
   Consumer Federation of America affiliates around the nation will
survey the price of staples each month, reported CFA Executive
Director Stephen Brobeck.
   ``We want to help prevent any unjustifiable increases in the
name of drought damage,'' said Ellen Haas of the group Public Voice
for Food and Health Policy.
   Assistant Agriculture Secretary Ewen Wilson said Tuesday that
the drought is expected to boost food prices 3 percent to 5 percent
this year. Next year food prices could rise another 2 percent to 3
percent, in addition to any inflation increases, department
officials have speculated.
   Brobeck said that the price surveys will cover breakfast cereal,
beef, poultry, pasta, canned and frozen vegetables, cooking oils,
margarine, sugar and coffee.
   He said that the initial survey next week will be used to
establish baseline prices and that monthly comparison surveys will
be continued through at least October.
   The surveys will be conducted in major supermarket chains by
local consumer groups in the Washington area, California, Arizona,
New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Minnesota, Alaska,
Wisconsin and Idaho.

   To the ranks of Donahue and Oprah Winfrey, add a
new possibility: New York City Opera director Beverly Sills.
   The former diva has agreed to produce a pilot for her own daily,
one-hour variety program that would go on the air in September 1989.
   Miss Sills, who announced in May her plans to retire Jan. 1 as
general director of the opera company, said then she was
considering accepting a TV talk-show offer.
   ``At this point in my career, I am only willing to do things
that I can have fun with,'' Miss Sills, 59, said Wednesday. ``This
sounds like a lot of fun.''
   The Brooklyn-born coloratura soprano was the company's biggest
star for 25 years until 1980, when she retired from singing.
   Miss Sills agreed to the pilot program this week with G.T.G.
East, part of a joint venture between Grant Tinker and the Gannett

   Actor Peter O'Toole will have no public
audience for his court dispute with a New Jersey woman over custody
of their 5-year-old son, a judge has ruled.
   Superior Court Judge Alexander Lehrer closed the trial
Wednesday, saying the case had ``no significant legal import'' such
as the case of Baby M which involved a surrogate mother's battle
for custody of her daughter.
   The boy, Lorcan O'Toole, has been caught between O'Toole and
Karen Somerville O'Toole since they separated in 1983. In May, a
judge in London ordered O'Toole to return Lorcan to Ms. Somerville
O'Toole so the courts in New Jersey could decide which parent
should get custody.
   A New Jersey court had already given the couple joint custody of
the boy in an agreement valid through September 1989. But both
sides now seek a change in that agreement.

   Billionaire John Kluge is known as a
shrewd dealmaker.
   Here's an example:
   The 73-year-old owner of Metromedia Inc. could get $4 million by
selling his waterfront house in Westchester County. But, by
dividing the lot in two, he can get an additional $500,000.
   On Tuesday night, the local zoning board unanimously approved a
variance that will allow Kluge to divide the lot.
   In 1972, Kluge paid $350,000 for an 18-room house located on a
little more than an acre. He later bought property next door,
slightly less than an acre, for $2 million and razed an 11-room
house so he could add on to his home.
   Kluge changed his mind about the addition, however, and decided
to sell.
   Kluge could sell the entire property as one lot for about $4
million, according to an appraisal submitted to the zoning board.
But by selling two lots, Kluge should get at least an additional
$500,000, the appraisal said.
   Kluge, who is worth $3 billion, is the second-richest American,
trailing Sam Walton, head of the Wal-Mart retailing chain,
according to Forbes magazine.

   William Christopher, who played the chaplain
on the television series ``M-A-S-H,'' and his wife, Barbara, said
they sensed something was wrong with their son the first night he
was home. The infant thrashed in his crib all night.
   Their son, Ned, also didn't speak until he was 3 years old and
often refused to look at his parents, the Christophers told the
Autism Society of America on Wednesday.
   Eventually, they said, they found out that Ned was autistic,
which strikes about one in every 700 people. Despite their
determination to correct his condition, they said they learned that
autism can't be corrected but is a lifelong affliction that can be
treated.
   Autism impairs the way its victims receive and process
information.
   Although the Christophers tried to keep Ned at home, it proved
to be harder than they could cope with. Ned, now 20, is now living
in a home for autistic people in Santa Barbara, Calif., where he's
thriving, the couple said.
   The Christophers have written a book about Ned, ``Mixed
Blessings,'' which will be published next spring. Although
Christopher has been speaking about his experience with autism for
five years, Wednesday marked the first time his wife spoke publicly
about their son.

   Jesse Jackson said today he had received an
apology from a top aide to Michael Dukakis but is asking former
President Carter to step in and help ease continuing tension
between their two camps.
   Jackson said Carter could play ``a real role in facilitating a
meeting between the appropriate parties. He has gained the respect
of all of us.''
   Despite sending conciliatory signals to the Dukakis camp,
Jackson said, ``We will exercise all of our rights,'' and he added,
``We are prepared to deliberate and debate, Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday'' during next week's Democratic National Convention.
   At a news conference before heading to Atlanta, Jackson said he
did not want a ``personal apology'' but rather a role for his
supporters.
   ``Presently, I do not know the proposed strategy to win. At this
point, my constituency has no place on the team,'' he said.
   ``Mr. Bentsen symbolizes one wing of our party,'' he said. ``I
represent the other wing of the party. On a number of issues, our
views are opposite. That's all right. There is room for both. It
takes two wings to fly, and so far, our wing is not connected.''
   In what a Jackson aide called a ``good start'' to mending
relations between the two men, Dukakis telephoned Jackson on
Wednesday to try to ease misunderstandings over the way Jackson
learned about the selection of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas as
Dukakis' running mate.
   Earlier Thursday, top Dukakis aide Paul Brountas called Jackson
on the same subject.
   On Wednesday, Jackson may have fueled the passions of those who
want to run him against Bentsen by saying the floor was ``wide
open'' on the vice presidential vote next Thursday night.
   Democratic National Committee chairman Paul Kirk said today in
Atlanta that Dukakis had talked to Jackson by telephone ``within
the last 24 hours'' in an effort to rebuild frayed relations.
   ``I know there has been a conversation between the two
candidates and several conversations between the two campaigns,''
Kirk said. ``I think we'll be moving forward to make sure there are
continuing discussions and hopefully we'll be able to resolve any
differences on substantive matters.''
   Jackson convention manager Ron Brown, also in Atlanta, said
Dukakis and Jackson agreed in their conversation to keep in touch
between now and Sunday, when both men are in Atlanta.
   ``It was an important call and a good start,'' Brown said.
   Asked if the call mollified Jackson about the perceived slight
over the fact that he learned of Bentsen's selections from
reporters, not Dukakis, Brown said, ``I guess his reaction is the
same as mine.''
   ``It just seems to us that the most important thing the Dukakis
campaign had to do during this process was consult with Jesse
Jackson and keep him informed. They failed to do either,'' Brown
said. ``That is a very significant oversight.''
   Jackson's departure by bus caravan to the convention city comes
as many of his supporters are still reeling from what they
considered Dukakis' snub.
   Dukakis says he tried to call Jackson on Tuesday morning to tell
him Lloyd Bentsen had been picked, but was not able to reach him.
He spoke with Jackson before the actual announcement, but after
reports were already circulating of the Texas senator's selection.
   And two Democratic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Jackson was told privately Monday afternoon that he would not
be picked. One source said Dukakis campaign chairman Paul Brountas
told Jackson ``he would bring the ticket down'' if nominated for
vice president.
   A clearly irked Jackson complained in a news conference that
Dukakis is excluding him from the unity team Jackson has repeatedly
emphasized as the key to victory in November.
   ``At this point I'm not in the partnership,'' he said, adding:
``I'm not suggesting that I will compete for a place on the ticket
but the floor is wide open on Thursday night when the
recommendation is made.''
   ``I'm being asked to, in spite of inadequate communication and
not being recommended for the ticket, to motivate more people and
deliver more votes and pour out more energy at greater risk and
danger than any governor or any senator.''
   He would expect in return, he said, satisfaction for ``the
legitimate and reasonable requests'' of his constituents.
   On Wednesday night, speaking to Operation PUSH, the civil rights
group he founded, Jackson sounded similar themes, complaining about
exclusion.
   ``For too long, the power brokers have sat in small rooms with
closed doors and made great decisions,'' he declared. ``We must be
a part of this process. When they sit around these tables, the key
investors in our party are not in the group.''
   Jackson officials had been negotiating privately on unresolved
platform issues, but those talks were halted in light of the
running mate matter, Brown said.
   It's up to Dukakis ``to make it a unity convention,'' Brown
said, adding that Jackson has the logistical wherewithal to ``make
our presence felt'' on any matter at the convention.
   Jackson told his news conference that ``many people have a sense
of indignation and a sense of insult,'' about the handling of
Bentsen's selection.
   After Dukakis and Bentsen met with the Congressional Black
Caucus Wednesday, some of his Capitol Hill supporters said they
were satisfied the communication foul-up Tuesday was inadvertent.
   ``Lots of fences have been mended,'' said Rep. Mervyn Dymally,
D-Calif., chairman of the caucus. ``We have a very fruitful
discussion about the convention, the campaign and the presidency.''

   Jesse Jackson today asked Jimmy Carter to mediate
his dispute with Democratic nominee-to-be Michael Dukakis.
Republican George Bush added his opinion that Dukakis could have
shown ``a little more in terms of sensitivity'' toward Jackson in
the way he announced his running mate.
   Jackson said former President Carter ``understands the
equation'' as the Democrats try to patch up relations between the
Dukakis and Jackson camps in the final days before the Democratic
National Convention.
   ``I simply want the respect and responsibility,'' Jackson said
at a Chicago news conference before starting a three-day bus trip
ending at the convention here.
   Bush made his comment on Dukakis and sensitivity as he traveled
to the United Nations Security Council, where he strongly defended
the United States' actions in the Persian Gulf.
   Relations between Jackson and Dukakis have been chilly since
Dukakis choose Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as his running mate on
Tuesday.
   The Massachusetts governor tried to warm up the situation with a
telephone call to Jackson on Wednesday.
   ``It was an important call and a good start,'' Jackson
convention manager Ron Brown said today. He said Dukakis tried to
explain the failure in communicating Dukakis' vice presidential
choice to Jackson before word got out on Tuesday.
   Jackson said he called Carter this morning to ask him to help
out.
   ``He has earned respect of all of us,'' Jackson said. ``He
understands the equation.''
   Jackson warned he still may challenge Dukakis every night of the
convention.
   ``It is an open convention. We have not yet made a decision
about all the strategies we will employ,'' Jackson said. ``We will
exercise all of our rights.''
   He said it is an ``open question'' as to whether he'll allow his
name to be entered in nomination for vice president.
   Democratic National Committee chairman Paul Kirk and House
Speaker Jim Wright, who will chair the convention, were both
hopeful that the differences between the campaigns could be
resolved.
   ``I think we'll be moving forward to make sure there are
continuing discussions and hopefully we'll be able to resolve any
differences on substantive matters,'' Kirk said in Atlanta.
   In Washington, Wright said Jackson had ``earned and fully
deserves a place in the highest councils, and he will have it.''
   Kirk acknowledged that negotiations on the platform are still
stalled, and he said he had personally talked to Jackson to explain
his role in the Tuesday announcement of Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as
Dukakis's running mate.
   Dukakis and Bentsen spent Wednesday mending fences with major
Jackson supporters, with some success.
   ``It's a strong ticket. It's a winning ticket,'' said Rep. John
Lewis of Georgia after Dukakis and Bentsen met with the
Congressional Black Caucus on Capitol Hill. ``It was very friendly
in the room.''
   Bush, who is moving to start the process of selecting his own
running mate, talked to a breakfast gathering in Baltimore today
before heading to the United Nations.
   In Baltimore, Bush was asked how he would have handled Jackson
if he had been Dukakis.
   ``Maybe he (Dukakis) could have done a little more in terms of
sensitivity,'' he told the gathering of black businessmen.
   The Republican vice president said he and Jackson have ``a
pleasant relationship. ... I give him great credit for mobilizing
our attention on the need to address the narcotics question.''
   Then Bush flew to New York, where he was to speak for the Reagan
administration at the U.N. Security Council, defending the
government's actions in the shooting down of an Iranian airliner by
a U.S. warship in the Persian Gulf.
   Bush, in his prepared speech, blamed the Iranian government for
allowing the airliner to fly over the gulf as its gunboats and the
USS Vincennes were fighting, calling such a decision
``irresponsible.''
   ``One thing is clear,'' he said, ``the USS Vincennes acted in
self-defense'' in firing two missiles at the jetliner, which U.S.
officials say was mistaken for an Iranian F-14 fighter closing in
on the cruiser.
   Two new national polls gave sharply conflicting views of where
the race for the White House stands before the Democratic
convention opens _ and before the selection of Bentsen was
announced.
   The Los Angeles Times survey gave Dukakis an 11-point lead, 49
percent to 38 percent, over Bush in 1,763 telephone interviews with
registered voters conducted July 5-10. Several other national polls
have given Dukakis a lead of about 10 points.
   But a USA Today-CNN poll put the two contenders in a virtual
tie. That survey of 1,264 registered voters July 6-10 gave Bush 47
percent to Dukakis's 44 percent. Both surveys have sampling error
margins of about three percentage points, meaning the USA Today-CNN
results are a tie.
   Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, was spending the day at
the Statehouse in Boston, facing a state budget crisis.
   Jackson, beginning a three-day bus trip to Atlanta today, was
still frosty toward Dukakis. The civil rights leader has been
fuming over Dukakis' failure to tell him of his choice of Bentsen
Tuesday before he learned of it from reporters.
   ``After yesterday, many people have a sense of indignation and a
sense of insult,'' Jackson said at a Chicago news conference
Wednesday.
   At a Capitol Hill news conference, Dukakis said he had
apologized to Jackson when he did reach him Tuesday morning.
   ``I said I was sorry that I missed him on the first call,''
Dukakis said.

   President Reagan on Thursday visited the
radio station where he began his career as a broadcaster a
half-century ago, saying broadcasting ``is a good way of making a
living and a good way of serving others.''
   Reagan stopped at station WOC after visiting drought-stricken
farm areas in Southern Illinois.
   Reagan was invited to the station, where he went to work in
1932, to dedicate a new building that opened several months ago.
   ``A lot has changed since 1932, but in a funny way the business
stays the same,'' said the president, who still delivers a weekly
radio broadcast.
   ``Its a good way of making a living and a good way of serving
others,'' he said.
   The new station is three miles from the building where Reagan
started work broadcasting football games.
   The original studio was on the top floor of the Palmer School of
Chiropractic, which is now the administration building of the
Palmer College of Chiropractic.
   Donna Kendall, director of public relations for the college,
said its name was changed several years ago and the school and the
radio station were severed from each other sometime around 1940.
WOC was an abbreviation for World of Chiropractic.
   Reagan first showed up at WOC in the late summer of 1932,
borrowing his father's Oldsmobile to make the trip of approximately
75 miles from the family home in Dixon, Ill.
   It was his first stop on a round of small-town radio stations he
planned to visit in search of a job.
   Although the station did not have an opening, Reagan talked the
station manager into giving him a tryout.
   The manager offered him a chance to broadcast a University of
Iowa football game the next Saturday for $5 and his round-trip fare
from Dixon.
   He was then hired to broadcast the games throughout the football
season, at $10 a game.
   After a regular staff vacancy occurred, he went to work for the
station at $100 a month on Feb. 10, 1933. According to historian
Garry Wills, in his book, ``Reagan's America,'' Reagan had left by
the end of May to work for WOC's sister station, WHO in Des Moines.
   He stayed in Des Moines radio until 1937, when it was off to
Hollywood and the movie career that paved the way for his entry
into politics and his election as governor of California.

   Steve Nellis, a former carnival worker,
dreams of climbing a Ferris wheel again. Ron Miller imagines
himself as Tina Turner's steady boyfriend.
   The two and 13 other tremendously obese people are living in a
hotel here as part of a diet program. Most say it's a matter of
life or death.
   ``It took a doctor to tell me I had no more than nine years to
live,'' the 690-pound Nellis, of Hurst, Ill., said Thursday. ``They
had kept after me. I was dumb before and didn't want to listen.''
   Entertainer and nutritionist Dick Gregory set up the free diet
program in the Howard Johnson's hotel June 5. He said his
Philadelphia-based Dick Gregory Health Enterprises is paying for
each participant with proceeds from the sale of his diet drink.
   Nellis, 31, who arrived Tuesday, must remain in his hotel room
for now because he cannot walk down the hall without stopping every
few steps to catch his breath.
   He must sleep kneeling at the side of the bed because he cannot
breathe lying down, and dreams of the day he can get a full night's
rest.
   Nellis said he weighed 250 pounds until age 21 and worked at a
carnival, scaling Ferris wheels and working 18-hour days. Then he
began less active work as a cab driver and the pounds began to pile
up.
   He does not know why he put on so much weight but said it forced
him to quit his job and go on disability eight years ago.
   Nellis said that by losing weight he will relieve his wife of 10
years and two stepchildren of tending to his every need.
   The dieters rise at 4 a.m., and obesity-related problems for
some begin immediately. For example, Nellis cannot lift his knee,
57 inches around, into the hotel shower, so he uses a plastic
swimming pool to wash.
   Breakfast begins at 5:30 a.m. with two glasses of spring water
followed by 30 to 45 minutes of walking for those who can handle
it. Those who can't, stay in their rooms until they are able.
   After another glass of spring water, participants stretch for 30
minutes and then eat breakfast _ half a grapefruit and half an
orange.
   Group meditation or prayer is next, and at 8 a.m. the
participants can return to their rooms for two hours of rest. They
then meet in a conference room for activities such as Monopoly and
backgammon.
   Lunch consists of raw vegetables or fresh fruit with more spring
water; during the afternoon they have Gregory's Bahamian Diet
drink. Dinner is the same as lunch. The group returns to their
rooms at 8 p.m. with lights out at 10.
   Gregory's company distributes his multivitamin powder through
mail orders and a nationwide network of sales people. The powder,
which sells in 16-ounce cans for $19.95, is mixed with fruit juice,
said Barbara Cain, a member of Gregory's staff.
   The powder has been sold since 1984, Ms. Cain said, adding that
exact yearly sales figures were unavailable.
   Gregory said the dieters needed to escape their
often-overprotective homes where their every whim was answered.
   ``These bodies were reserved for death,'' he said. ``It's
closing-down systems time. We're starting it up again. It's not
going to be easy.''
   Miller, 25, of Marion, Ind., who weighed 624 pounds when he
arrived last month, has dropped to about 500. His crush on
long-legged rock singer Tina Turner has been a major motivation to
shed pounds.
   ``I can't wait to meet her,'' Miller said with a laugh. ``I am
crazy about that woman. I want to be her next husband.''
   The battle against the bulge is constant.
   ``Some of us cry'' out of frustration at not being able to eat,
said Mike Parteleno, 30, of Struthers, Ohio. Parteleno said he
weighed 1,023 pounds when he met Gregory after hearing him lecture
in February. He said he has lost 307 pounds.
   Participants are weighed weekly on a specially designed
electronic scale that can weigh up to 2,000 pounds, said Ms. Cain.
   Nancy Gray, 48, of Duxbury, Mass., who weighs 338 pounds, is
participating with her 16-year-old son, Joe, who weighs 321. ``Life
was just a continuous meal for us,'' Mrs. Gray said, describing 2
a.m. forays into the kitchen to cook steak and mashed potatoes.
   Joenita Mitchell of Biloxi, Miss., who weighs 512 pounds and
arrived Wednesday, saw Gregory on a talk show. ``I eat, eat and
eat,'' said the 15-year-old, adding that she had a heart attack
when she was 14. ``It's taken its toll.''

   Weather experts discussed the drought
Thursday and its possible causes and effects, and said they hoped
to produce a consensus on how much longer it will last.
   All of the speakers at the 1988 Drought Symposium called for
more research and study.
   ``There's an enormous number of possibilities that one could
chase. The next business of the scientist is to eliminate the
possibilities of ... and extend the range of analysis and look for
cause and effect,'' said David Rodenhuis, director of the federal
Climate Analysis Center in Washington.
   The symposium attended by 13 state and national experts was
sponsored by The Weather Channel, an Atlanta-based cable network,
which broadcast the meeting live.
   John Hope, the network's hurricane specialist and a former
forecaster with the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Fla., said
the drought in the Southeast might be lessened or ended in the next
few months by a heavier than normal hurricane season.
   Hope said current weather conditions point to more tropical
storms, more of which should become hurricanes, in this hurricane
season.
   He stressed that a hurricane's effect on drought is variable,
depending on the intensity and speed of the storm. Nevertheless, he
said, some Southeastern states get as much as 25 pecent of their
rainfall in some months from hurricanes.
   Georgia state climatologist Gayther Plummer told the symposium
he thought the position of the planet Jupiter had something to do
with drought in the Southeast.
   However, Rodenhuis said he was skeptical about Plummer's thesis.
``It's very necessary to be cautious and analytical about the
issue,'' he said.

<HEAD>House OKs Resolution Condemning Sandinmistas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House voted 385-18 on Thursday to condemn
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government for ``brutal suppression
of basic human rights'' and urged the democracies of Central
America to meet to assess the situation.
   Unlike a similar resolution adopted by the Senate in a 91-4 roll
call Wednesday night, the measure drafted by the House's Democratic
leadership did not pose the possibility that military aid to the
Contra rebels might eventually be resumed.
   The House version condemned the Sandinistas for arresting more
than 40 people, including opposition leaders, and for closing down
the opposition newspaper LaPrensa for 15 days and a Roman Catholic
radio station indefinitely.
   It also urged Central American leaders ``to convene immediately
to assess the conditions in Nicaragua described in this
resolution.''
   ``I expect this body to take stronger action later,'' said Rep.
Robert J. Lagamarsino, R-Calif. ``This resolution contains strong
words. But it is just that _ strong words. There are no teeth in
this resolution.''
   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., said the resolution is necessary
because ``it is important that we in this country condemn any
violations of the principle of democracy.''
   Bonior said he believes there is still life in the peace process
fostered by President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica. ``The basis for
progress, I believe, still remains,'' he said.
   Earlier Thursday, U.S. Ambassador Robert Melton, expelled from
Managua this week by the Sandinistas, told the Senate Intelligence
Committee he believes congressional resolutions do little to sway
the Sandinistas.
   Melton said he does think ``the Sandinistas are impressed with
any evidence of resoluteness on the part of the Congress and
evidence of bipartisan resolve.'' But he added, ``I think the
Sandinistas are impressed more by actions than by words.''
   Melton said embassy functions have been so crippled by that
country's leftist Sandinista government that there are only ``very
marginal'' reasons to maintain diplomatic relations.
   The United States has made no move to end relations and
administration officials say they plan to replace embassy aides
ousted with Melton as soon as possible.
   ``One of the near-term tests is when we send new people there,''
Melton said. He said the manner in which they are treated and
permitted to operate ``will be a very real test of their (the
Sandinistas') desire to maintain relations.''
   The ambassador was asked by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., if there
is any purpose for the United States to maintain a diplomatic
presence in Nicaragua, ``which gives legitimacy to the
government,'' if the embassy cannot function.
   ``Very marginal, very marginal purposes,'' Melton replied.
   He said that in his three months in Managua he was falsely
accused of masterminding ``Plan Melton,'' a conspiracy allegedly
aimed at subverting the Sandinista government.
   But Melton said there is ``not one scintilla of evidence'' that
he or the seven other U.S. diplomats expelled with him on Monday
ever engaged in espionage or any other activity that could have
justified action against them.
   The Sandinistas protested the contents of a speech Melton
delivered at the U.S. Embassy in celebration of Independence Day,
but he said the quotes to which they objected were not his but
those of Abraham Lincoln.
   Melton testified that embassy officials were followed by
Sandinista agents armed with cameras and that their photographs,
falsely identifying them as CIA agents, were printed in local
newspapers.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley reacted
sharply to a claim by the director general of the Nicaraguan
Foreign Ministry, Alejandro Bendana, that U.S. diplomats had
taunted Nicaraguan police at a rally last Sunday in Nandaime.
   Bendana sought to prove his case by showing a photograph on U.S.
news broadcasts of the diplomats with their hands raised.
   Mrs. Oakley called the use of photographs ``well-known
propagandistic devices'' because the message they convey can be
easily manipulated. She said the photograph shown by Bendana was
taken at a time when the embassy personnel were signaling other
members of their group to prepare to depart.
   Melton denied that embassy officials participated in the
opposition rally or were present in any other capacity than that of
observers.
   One committee member, Sen. Howard W. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said he
was skeptical that the Sandinistas expelled the U.S. diplomats with
no rational motive.
   ``I kid you not when I say there is something bothering me in
the back of my mind,'' Metzenbaum said. ``Why did President Daniel
Ortega _ in what seems to fly in the face of logic and reason _
take the steps that he did at the time that he did. I have the
feeling that I don't know everything.''
   Melton replied: ``If these actions seem irrational, it is
because they are.''
   Melton said that since arriving in Managua in April, most of his
requests for meetings with Sandinista officials were ignored and
the government attempted to discourage his contacts with opposition
figures, something he defended as normal U.S. diplomatic practice.
   He called the expulsion order ``an attempt to intimidate the
opposition, that's the way I think it should be recognized.''
   ``The message to the opposition is, `You're alone _ and you're
in our hands,''' he said.

   A woman used money embezzled from her
new employer to pay back money stolen from her old employer,
prosecutors said.
   Ernestine Allen was arrested in June 1987 when the Gulf Group
Service Corp., a subsidiary of Gulf Life Insurance Co., discovered
she had been writing checks for undocumented insurance claims.
   A bookkeeper auditing Mrs. Allen's work discovered a $1,399
check was written for a fraudulent claim and mailed to her father's
home. Prosecutors said her father apparently was unaware of what
his daughter was doing.
   Mrs. Allen told company officials the check was the only one she
had written and she resigned her position, court records show.
Further auditing disclosed she had written 15 additional checks
using fraudulent documentation for a total of $10,300.
   The checks were deposited in a bank account at Marine National
Bank of Jacksonville.
   Mrs. Allen was charged with grand theft but agreed to repay the
money if the judge would withhold adjudication of guilt and not
sentence her to jail. She told prosecutors her family had agreed to
loan her the money for restitution.
   The judge sentenced her to one month's probation and ordered her
to pay back the money. He withheld a guilty ruling.
   She then got a job with Southeastern Metals Manufacturing Co.
   Mrs. Allen, 37, was arrested Wednesday and charged with five
counts of forgery and faces a charge of second-degree grand theft.
   Assistant State Attorney Lance Day said prosecutors have
evidence that Mrs. Allen took $47,725 from her new employer, by
writing 87 payroll checks to an employee who left the company a
long time ago. Mrs. Allen deposited the checks into her account at
Marine National, Day said.
   Day said authorities also have discovered five fraudulent money
orders issued for a total of $21,100. One was for $10,300, Day
said, the amount of the restitution to her first employer.
   Mrs. Allen was being held in the Duval County Jail.

<HEAD>Committee Votes to Kill Siegan Nomination to Appeals Court</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee today voted
along party lines to kill the appeals court nomination of Bernard
Siegan, a conservative California law professor whose writings are
often at odds with Supreme Court precedent.
   The committee voted 8-6 for a Democratic motion recommending
Senate rejection of Siegan, and minority Republicans said their
fight for the University of San Diego professor was over.
   President Reagan nominated Siegan for the 9th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals which covers nine Western states.
   After the party line vote on Sen. Edward Kennedy's motion for a
negative recommendation, Republicans failed in a move to have the
nomination reported to the Senate without recommendation. The vote
was 7-7, with Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., voting with the GOP.
   Kennedy, D-Mass., criticized Siegan's lack of experience before
federal courts _ he had one case three decades ago _ and said the
nominee practiced ``judicial activism in the extreme.''
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., defended Siegan, saying his
judicial philosophy ``should not be the single criteria'' for
judging him. He added ``nothing about his character, experience or
background'' should stop him from serving on the court.
   Siegan wrote that the 1954 Supreme Court decision outlawing
school segregation was correct, but decided by faulty reasoning.
   The landmark ruling, Siegan said, should have been based on the
right of black students to travel to the schools of their choice.
His critics said this would have left students at the schoolhouse
door, without guaranteeing a seat inside.
   Siegan said prayer in schools could be constitutional, although
the Supreme Court has said otherwise. He wrote that equal weight
should be given to property rights and human rights. And he said
framers of the 14th Amendment, which guarantees basic freedoms,
never intended its scope to be as broad as that defined by the
Supreme Court.
   Siegan, 63, tried to save his troubled nomination at a hearing
last February, when he told the committee he would follow Supreme
Court precedent, and not his own feelings, if approved by the
Senate.
   ``If a case comes where I can't observe the law of the land I
would resign,'' Siegan said then. ``There are times I will rule
contrary to my own feelings.''
   The 9th circuit has jurisdiction over Alaska, Arizona,
California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington,
Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.

   The hard hats came off, the lights and music came
on, and the rostrum rose seemingly on its own Thursday, signaling
that the home of the 1988 Democratic National Convention is ready.
Well, nearly ready.
   Atlanta's Omni Coliseum, bedecked in a television designer's
vision of patriotic colors _ pink, gray and pale blue _ was
declared complete in a brief ribbon-cutting ceremony.
   Then it was back to work, because this enormous complex of
podiums, risers, camera platforms and network studios inside what
is otherwise home for the Atlanta Hawks basketball team won't be
fully ready until the gavel falls Monday.
   ``Don't take for granted it was just another day's work,''
Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk told construction workers
who gathered in the seats where delegates will sit next week. ``It
was a page in history.''
   The hall where Michael Dukakis will claim his party's
presidential nomination has been the scene of hurried preparations
for weeks, and as the advance wave of journalists and party
officials arrived over the last several days, they could hardly
hear each other over the din of construction.
   Kirk and Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young showed off the fancy
moveable podium sections after the ribbon was cut. They are
controlled with hydraulic lifts by a stage manager who will sit
behind the speakers _ and who has the power with a flip of a
control to make 5-foot 8-inch Dukakis look as tall as 6-foot 2-inch
Jackson _ at least on television.
   The entire hall is amazingly small _ so small that half the
4,212 delegates won't actually sit on the floor. They'll be in the
bleachers.
   What it looks like, actually, is a television set. And that's
basically what it is.
   ``I approached it from that standpoint,'' said Rene Lagler, a
California television set designer who planned the convention
interior.
   Lagler also came up with the color scheme, which he prefers to
call red white and blue.
   ``On camera the whole thing will look red, white and blue,'' he
said. ``Just squint: that's what it will look like on television.''
   Some squinters, however, found the colors remained pink, gray
and pale blue.
   Overhead, lights swiveled by remote control, as they will when
the convention begins, and canned music poured from giant speakers
that were sniffed by bomb-detecting dogs before they were lifted
overhead. For delegates in seats so poor they can't see, giant
television screens atop the whole thing will provide a view.
   Mike McCurry, the convention's director of communications, said
that while all looks pretty close to ready there are constant
demands for adjustments.
   ``I walked in here yesterday and thought, `My lord, they're not
going to be ready,''' McCurry said. ``But they've done a lot in two
days.''
   Even as the ribbon was cut, however, television microwave
receivers were still being installed above studio ``skyboxes'' that
allow anchormen to look down on the whole thing.
   CNN's team of correspondents, producers and crews had been
standing around for hours, their scheduled dress rehearsal of floor
coverage left dead in the water by a failed radio system.
   The big dispute of the week was over where the four television
networks' ``talent'' _ the big-name correspondents _ were going to
sit. After a howl of protest that they were being placed too far up
behind the podium, McCurry accommodated them with a closer spot.
   The full podium is 200 feet wide, though what moves is only a
smaller rostrum and surrounding area. The huge structure further
reduces in size what is already a small hall _ seating no more than
12,000 to 17,000 people for sports events.
   Just off the floor is the Hawks' office, where general manager
Stan Kasten strolled out to declare the hall unrecognizable.
   ``It's amazing,'' he said.
   Most of the 13,500 or so journalists won't even get in the hall,
or will only part of the time. They're being accommodated in the
vast Georgia World Congress Center, dubbed the ``Media Village.''
There's plenty of room _ but it's another world from the hall, and
to get there is a walk out doors and across the street.
   Outside the whole thing, scores of satellite uplink trucks were
being put in place, their dish antennas pointed skyward. There's a
mobile-home village of network equipment _ and the handful of
trailers the Dukakis and Jackson campaigns each will use as command
posts.
   Back inside, Lagler was looking over his labors when one of his
hard-hatted workers came up with a question: when was the meeting
to discuss tearing it all down after Thursday night.
   ``That'll be another problem,'' Lagler said, ``getting all this
out of here.''

<HEAD>Judge Apologizes for Outburst over `Ms.'</HEAD>

   A federal judge apologized Thursday to an
attorney he had scolded and threatened with jail when she insisted
on using her maiden name and the courtesy title ``Ms.'' in court.
   ``I have always referred to married women by their married name.
This is the way my generation was taught,'' said Senior U.S.
District Judge Hubert Teitelbaum, 73.
   ``I recognize your right to be addressed in any manner in which
you see fit, and I apologize for my comments and the resulting
situation,'' the judge told Barbara Wolvovitz and three other
attorneys involved in the trial of a race discrimination suit
against PPG Industries Inc.
   On July 8, Teitelbaum told Ms. Wolvovitz, whose husband is
University of Pittsburgh law professor Jules Lobel: ``From here on,
in this courtroom you will use Mrs. Lobel. That's your name.''
   The judge originally threatened her with jail when she resisted
his instruction, and when her co-counsel, Jon Pushinsky, protested,
Teitelbaum found him in contempt for ``officious intermeddling''
and gave him a suspended 30-day jail sentence.
   Ms. Wolvovitz, representing two black men suing PPG, moved
Monday for a mistrial, which Teitelbaum rejected. When she again
stated her preference, he said: ``What if I call you sweetie?'' The
judge said he would settle for calling her ``counselor.'' He also
vacated his contempt order for Pushinsky.
   The jury began deliberations Wednesday afternoon and was still
out when the judge made his apology, which was officially entered
into court records.
   Teitelbaum said that if Ms. Wolvovitz still wanted to press for
a mistrial, he would grant it before the jury returned with a
verdict.
   Teitelbaum said the parties would be ``stuck with that verdict''
if they declined his offer.
   The attorneys agreed to not seek a mistrial. Hours later, the
jury decided against Ms. Wolvovitz's clients, who had charged they
were harassed at work because of their race.
   Ms. Wolvovitz, 36, who has practiced law for 10 years, and
Pushinsky did not want to comment further after the judge's
apology, Pushinsky said Thursday.
   ``I think that he did what he had to do, and thank God he did
it,'' said National Organization for Women President Molly Yard, a
Pittsburgh resident who is familiar with Teitelbaum. ``I think it's
raised everybody's consciousness and that's fine.''
   Tom Hollander, president of the Allegheny County Bar
Association, said: ``I think it was big of him to apologize.''
   JoAnn Dempler, Teitelbaum's law clerk for eight years, said the
judge ``is not sexist ... does not discriminate against woman ...
does not demean women.''
   ``He's a tease,'' she said Thursday. ``His sense of humor is
such that he likes to tease and joke and kid around, and if people
do not know that, they could easily misconstrue what he's doing or
saying.
   ``Even in court, because we're dealing with very serious
matters, every once in a while to just sort of inject a little
levity or reduce tension he will make a lighthearted remark, and
people who know him realize he doesn't mean to offend anyone,''
Mrs. Dempler said.
   Teitelbaum said he wasn't teasing when he told Ms. Wolvovitz she
would ``sleep in the county jail tonight'' if she refused to be
addressed as Mrs. Lobel.
   ``I unfortunately lost my temper and the matter then got out of
hand,'' he said.
   The judge also said he misstated Pennsylvania law when he told
Ms. Wolvovitz she was legally required to use her husband's last
name unless she had court permission to do otherwise.
   ``I was wrong,'' Teitelbaum said. ``I made a mistake.''

   The narcotics arrest of the chairman of the
Mole Lake Indian Reservation was no surprise in light of the
Chippewa band's struggle with drug problems, says the vice chairman.
   Vice Chairman Roger McGeshick Sr. said he planned to call a
community meeting to discuss the arrest Tuesday of Arlyn Ackley as
well as narcotics traffic on the reservation in northern Wisconsin.
   Ackley, 36, chairman of the Mole Lake Tribal Council for six
years, was jailed on $10,000 bail on two counts of delivery of
cocaine.
   Brian Maloney, Oneida County district attorney, said Ackley also
faces cocaine charges in Forest and Outagamie counties, and could
be in danger from narcotics suppliers.
   An undercover agent purchased one ounce of cocaine from Ackley
two times in November, the Wisconsin Division of Criminal
Investigation said.
   McGeshick, 47, a cousin of Ackley as well as the tribal vice
chairman, called drugs the biggest problem on the 1,850-acre Mole
Lake reservation, home to about 375 members of the Sokaogon, one of
six bands of the state's 1,200-member Chippewa tribe.
   The arrest of Ackley, McGeshick said, would not affect the
band's business, including talks with the state concerning
off-reservation hunting and fishing.
   Each charge against Ackley carries a possible penalty of not
less than $1,000 nor more than $250,000, and a prison term of not
less than six months nor more than five years, Maloney said.

   Black members of Congress predicted Thursday
that there will be boisterous protests at next week's Democratic
convention in Atlanta over what they see as Gov. Michael Dukakis'
snub of Jesse Jackson.
   But some of the lawmakers also said they understand political
realities and will hold a black strategy session early in the week
in an effort to repair the schism between the Dukakis and Jackson
camps and end the quadrennial meeting as a unified party.
   ``Clearly the way Jesse Jackson was dealt with, on a personal
basis, looms as a monumental issue,'' said Rep. Ron Dellums,
D-Calif. ``It speaks to how black people are perceived in this
election. He is the personification of the hopes of millions of
people. Whether Mr. Dukakis understands that or not is something
that remains to be seen.''
   Jackson and his supporters were stung by Dukakis' selection of
Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen for the vice presidential spot on the
Democratic ticket, and the hurt was compounded when Jackson first
learned about the choice from reporters rather than directly from
Dukakis.
   Dukakis telephoned Jackson on Wednesday to try to mend strained
relations, and Jackson said Thursday he had asked former President
Jimmy Carter to mediate between the two camps. Jackson also said he
got an apology from a top Dukakis aide but no apology from Dukakis.
   The lawmakers said their concerns extended beyond the personal
tiff to the appearance that issues of concern to blacks were being
given short shrift.
   Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., chairman of the Congressional
Black Caucus, said meetings aimed at healing the rift are being set
up for his group with Paul Brountas, the top Dukakis aide who ran
the campaign's vice-presidential search, and possibly later with
Dukakis himself.
   ``We are trying to salvage this,'' Dymally said, acknowledging
that there is a wide range of intensity about the matter among the
23 black House members who make up the caucus. ``We are practical
politicians.''
   Some caucus members said they recognized the danger to their
political standing if Jackson appears to be going to the convention
purely as a spoiler.
   The Black Caucus was working through Rep. Nicholas Mavroules,
D-Mass., to set up the meetings, and Mavroules said he expected
there to be a lengthy meeting, perhaps on Tuesday.
   ``I think it would be a very wise idea on the part of the
Dukakis people,'' Mavroules said. ``They can talk at length about
problems, about issues. And if they want, they can talk about the
Jackson thing ... I would like very much if we could have a nice,
good, normal, united convention.''
   Mavroules said the members of the Congressional Black Caucus
``play a very key role. We need them with us. I think most of them
want this settled.''
   Some of those lawmakers, however, appeared to be turning up the
heat on Dukakis. Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill., vowed to stage a march on
Monday from the grave of slain civil rights leader Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr. to the Omni convention center.
   Savage said another protest rally will be held on Wednesday near
the convention center just before the presidential nomination is
made, and said blacks would boycott the acceptance speeches on
Thursday of Dukakis and Bentsen if Jackson is not on the ticket.
   Dellums said Dukakis is showing ``a level of arrogance that is
extraordinary'' in not making an open and uncompromising apology to
Jackson. He and others said it is up to Dukakis to extend a hand to
Jackson and make a public show of concern for Jackson and the
issues he represents.
   ``I think there's going to be a lot of confusion down in
Atlanta, a lot of pain down there,'' Dellums said.

<HEAD>Unisys Probe Involves Alleged Overcharges, Army Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts new 7th graf, ``The company'' with Unisys statement</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army Information Systems Command said
Thursday that a criminal investigation of Unisys Corp. in Arizona
involves alleged overcharging on a $9.2 million contract.
   The contract for computer support work between Unisys and the
systems command expired in September 1987 and relates to the way in
which costs were allocated by Sperry Corp., Army spokesman Al
Hinton said in a statement from Fort Huachuca, Ariz., where the
Army command is based.
   Sperry Corp. was merged with Burroughs Corp. to form Unisys
Corp. in 1986.
   Unisys has an estimated $80 million in computer hardware and
software support contracts with the Army Information Systems
Command. The Fort Huachuca investigation is separate from the
sweeping Pentagon bribery probe, in which Unisys is also involved.
   The command provides the Army worldwide with automated data
processing including office automation, communications, printing
and publishing, records management and visual information.
   The existence of the probe, under way for several months and
being conducted by the U.S. attorney's office in Tucson, was
confirmed Wednesday by Unisys from its headquarters in Blue Bell,
Pa., but no details were provided.
   The company said it ``has been cooperating with the office of
the U.S. attorney in Tucson, Ariz., in its investigation of a
contract with the Army Communications Center based in Fort
Huachuca.''
   Sperry and Unisys have provided software support to the command
for more than 10 years.
   The Wall Street Journal, which on Wednesday disclosed the
existence of the Fort Huachuca probe, quoted a source familiar with
the investigation as saying that the government contended it may
have been overcharged by as much as $10 million. But the Army
command statement said that ``any overcharges would be considerably
less'' in view of the total size of the contract of $9.2 million.

   Jesse Jackson, weighing his strategy options for
the Democratic convention next week, has put together a
sophisticated logistical operation that can handle just about any
decision he makes, his convention manager says.
   When Jackson's bus caravan arrives in town this weekend amid
great hoopla, awaiting will be the technical backbone of his
convention operation, born of weeks of planning and gritty detail.
   The setup, with systems to communicate instantly with floor
delegates was put in place at a time when it was not known how much
it would actually be used, said Jackson's convention manager Ron
Brown.
   In light of developments this week, when Jackson suspended
continuing platform talks with the Dukakis campaign, decisions are
up in the air as to what he will do at the convention. The
operation could end up being more important than originally
envisioned.
   ``You can assume we have the wherewithal to make our presence
felt on everything that happens at the convention,'' said Brown.
   Democratic National Committee press secretary Mike McCurry, the
party's convention spokesman, says Jackson ``did what the
Democratic Party itself should have done _ went out and hired some
of the most experienced and best convention organizers.''
   The party staff even sought out Jackson team members for advice
on how to handle an occasional problem of their own, McCurry said.
   Although Gov. Michael Dukakis is the convention's inevitable
convention nominee, McCurry said Jackson has ``a very well
organized operation that would rival Gov. Dukakis.
   ``It goes without saying that Gov. Dukakis has more resources
and something of an edge as a front runner,'' McCurry said, but
added, ``I would put both teams on the field and know that you
would have a very even game.''
   As recently as Monday, Jackson's headquarters trailers outside
the convention hall had working phones, electricity, furniture and
staff moving in. Dukakis' trailers nearby were empty, with about
two dozen filled water-cooler bottles lined up underneath one.
   ``The Dukakis people are peeking in the windows of our
trailer,'' Brown joked early in the week.
   Jackson intends to use the machinery in the traditional manner _
with a ``whip'' system to communicate from telephones in
headquarters trailers to delegates on the convention floor.
   ``We ran a very serious presidential campaign and we're running
a very sophisticated convention operation,'' Brown said.
   ``We're serious players on the American political scene now and
in the future, and I think we have to demonstrate that. You have to
demonstrate competence ... sense of purpose, discipline.''
   This year's operation is miles ahead of Jackson's 1984 set up in
San Francisco, when he made his first presidential bid.
   That year, Jacksonspent a fraction of the estimated $500,000 he
is putting into his staff of about 50 and preparations for this
year's convention.

   Police said a pistol-wielding Arab man
who had barricaded himself inside the Libyan Embassy for almost 12
hours after employees refused him a visa was taken into custody
late today.
   ``The situation at the Libyan Embassy is over,'' said police
spokesman Helmut Kuehlmann.
   He declined to give further details, saying a press conference
was scheduled at police headquarters later.
   The unidentified gunman, who police said was in his 20s, had
demanded to be flown to Libya, said another Bonn police spokesman,
Hans Georg Classen.
   Earlier, Classen said the man claimed he escaped from a West
German prison.
   ``He told police he had broken out of prison in the federal
republic (West Germany) and that he now wants to go to Libya,''
Classen said.
   Classen said the man barricaded himself on the first floor of
the building. He said the man took no hostages but that several
employees were trapped on upper floors in the building, officially
called the Libyan People's Bureau. He said he didn't know how many
people there were.
   Classen said the employees couldn't leave because the gunman
controlled access to the stairways and doors.
   ``What we are trying to do right now is to prevent any taking of
hostages,'' Classen had said.
   Several embassy employees stood on a balcony watching as police
surrounded the area.
   Classen said the man was an Arab, but his nationality was not
known. He said the gunman demanded to be flown to Libya immediately.
   He said the incident began began when the man entered the
building to apply for a visa. The request was refused and the man
then pulled a pistol, Classen said.
   The police spokesman said no shots were fired.
   Police sealed off the area after they received the alarm shortly
before 10 a.m., Classen said.

   President Reagan, seeing for himself the
devastation brought to farmers by this summer's drought, today told
those hard hit by the dry spell, ``We can't make it rain, but we
can help to ease the pain.''
   Reagan spoke to an audience of 200 or so gathered under a shade
tree at the fairgrounds here. To his back was a field of corn,
green from recent rains but still shriveled by the lack of moistute.
   Minutes earlier, Reagan had walked through corn and soybean
fields on Herman and Richard Krone's 2,800-acre farm. Reagan
towered over the corn, normally 8 feet high by now but today less
than half that height. Soybeans plants were a quarter of their
expected size.
   ``What I saw was not a pretty sight,'' Reagan told his audience.
   Earlier, Reagan had spent 25 minutes in the presidential
helicopter inspecting fields from the air.
   He noted the rains that had come to southern Illinois in recent
days. The rain, up to 4 inches in places, ``may have helped ... but
it hasn't solved the problem,'' he said.
   The White House has said that Reagan would sign relief
legislation making its way through Congress, provided that
rost-raising amendments are not tacked on.
   Asked about the amendments _ more than 30 in each house and
covering a variety of special interests _ Reagan said, ``I hope
that they're not being tacked on. I hope they are not getting away
with it.''
   Later, Reagan said in a luncheon speech in Davenport, Iowa, that
``we should keep our eye on the ball. Drought relief should be just
that, drought relief.'' Congress should not use it as an excuse to
rewrite farm legislation, he said.
   ``Partisanship should be kept out of the issue of drought
relief,'' the president said. ``Politics must stop at the parched
field's edge.''
   The White House said Reagan feels two forms of legislative help
are essential for farmers had hit through much of the nation:
   _Aid for farmers who have received advance deficiency payments,
which are advances on what a farmer expects to receive from the
government after harvest.
   ``As of now, many drought-stricken farms will have to refund
this money,'' the announcement from the White House press office
said.
   _Help for suffering farmers not covered by the
advance-deficiency payment system.
   The White House also noted that ``the president has been working
closely with the leadership of the House and Senate agriculture
committees and with governors from farm states to draft timely,
bipartisan legislation to help the many farmers who will suffer
substantial losses.''
   Although Krone's farm has had nearly 2 inches of rain this week
and some parts of southern Illinois have had up to 4 inches of rain
recently, agriculture experts say the rain won't do much to help
the already shriveled corn crop.
   ``Even though it has rained, when the president looks at the
crops, he's going to see a bad situation,'' said Steve Newman of
the Illinois Farm Bureau.
   At the 2,800-acre Krone farm, about 400 acres of the 1,200-acre
corn crop are believed to have been irreversibly damaged, for a
financial loss estimated at $35,000. Krone said corn stalks that
should be 10 feet to 12 feet high by this time of year measure only
2 feet to 5 feet, with burnt, brownish tassels.
   The dry spell also has parched 125 acres of pasture used to feed
Krone's 150 head of cattle, so that for the past month he has had
to feed them alfalfa hay.
   Krone, a Reagan admirer who doesn't receive any federal
subsidies, said, ``I'm not looking for a handout. I can survive if
there's no rain and it (the drought) continues.''
   From southern Illinois, Reagan flew to Davenport, Iowa, where he
took part in the dedication of a new building at radio station WOC,
where he broke into radio in 1932.
   ``A lot has changed since 1932, but in a funny way the business
stays the same,'' said the president, who still delivers a weekly
radio broadcast. ``It's a good way of making a living and a good
way of serving others,'' he said.
   On Wednesday, Reagan said he will do all he can to protect
farmers from excessive losses, but he won't approve drought-relief
measures that would ``bust the budget.''
   Congress is considering a bill to provide payments of up to
$100,000 apiece to farmers whose crops are destroyed or severely
damaged.
   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said that because of the
severity of the drought the administration would overlook minor
flaws in the bill. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
president ``generally supports this legislation.''
   The spokesman said the bill would cost about $5.5 billion.
   ``The bill would be financed with money that would have been
paid as subsidies to farmers in ordinary weather conditions,'' he
said. ``Because of higher cash prices, congressional aides
calculate the government farm programs could be as much as $8
billion less than originally estimated.''
   Reagan, meeting with farm leaders, said that drought-relief
legislation ``has to be considered in the context of our efforts to
reduce the federal deficit. To put it very simply, we mustn't bust
the budget.
   He said that ``the automatic budget sequestration cuts that
overspending triggers would take back from farmers with one hand
what we're providing in drought relief with the other.''
   There have been indications that the White House Office of
Management and Budget may be scrutinizing the surplus of federal
dollars available under the crop acreage support program as a means
of helping the government avoid mandatory budget cuts in mid-August
under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction act.

   Iran failed Thursday to get a clear condemnation
of the United States for the July 3 attack on an Iranian jetliner,
but a special session of the International Civil Aviation
Organization said it deplored the use of weapons against a civil
aircraft.
   The United Nations agency's 33-member governing Council
unanimously agreed to an independent ICAO investigation into the
disaster, with results to be reported at the next ICAO session
Sept. 15-16.
   ``We are delighted by the results,'' U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State Richard S. Williamson said at the end of two-day meeting.
``Temptations and efforts to politicize this session were
rebuffed.''
   Iranian spokesman Seirous Naseri said his country had hoped for
a strong condemnation of the United States and warned that the July
3 tragedy could recur unless U.S. forces withdraw from the Persian
Gulf.
   Naseri blamed ``political constraints'' for the Council's mild
response, citing American ``influence and power.''
   ``It is not easy for all countries to come out and speak very
frankly and openly against the United States, even when the United
States commits a very serious crime.''
   He said Iran would look to the U.N. Security Council for
political condemnation of the U.S. action.
   Williamson rankled when asked at a news conference if he had
engaged in arm-twisting. ``That's a ridiculous and insulting
assertion by the Iranians,'' he said. Naseri told the Council that
on July 5, two days after the U.S. warship Vincennes shot down Iran
Air flight 655 killing all 290 people on board, a domestic Iranian
flight was warned by U.S. forces in the gulf.
   ``Fortunately this time the warning was received by the pilot
and he was able to respond,'' Naseri said. ``This could have ended
in a similar tragedy.''
   The Iranians maintain that Iran Air 655 never received the seven
military and civilian channel radio warnings the Vincennes claims
it sent before firing.
   Naseri said he was not aware of why the pilot of the later
flight, Iran Air 235 from Bandar Langah to Bandar Abbas, heard the
U.S. warning when the doomed earlier flight apparently did not.
   Williamson said he was not aware of the second incident.
   The ICAO decision was in the form of a nine-part statement from
Council President Dr. Assad Kotaite.
   The Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Cuba, China and Kenya wanted
to back Iran more strongly by calling the statement a
``resolution'' but they were outvoted.
   The decision read very similarly to ICAO's response in 1983
after the Soviet Union shot down a Korean Air Lines jet, and that
was called a resolution. Following an investigation, ICAO did
condemn that Soviet action.
   In Thursday's decision, members asked the ICAO secretary general
to launch an immediate fact-finding investigation to determine
``all the relevant facts and technical aspects of the chain of
events relevant to the flight and destruction of the aircraft.''
   All relevant parties were urged to cooperate fully with the
probe. Iran and the United States said during the session that they
would.
   ``The Council deplored the use of weapons against a civil
aircraft,'' the decision said. It expressed ``profound regret'' at
the loss of lives and deep sympathy with the victims' families.
   The Council reaffirmed the principle that ``states must refrain
from resorting to the use of violence against civil aircraft,''
appealed to more nations to ratify a 1984 ICAO protocol to that
effect, and asked countries to refrain from jeopardizing the safety
of civil aviation in troubled areas.
   The decision also called on the ICAO to renew efforts to
coordinate civilian and military air traffic, improve routing in
troubled areas and review standards and practises.
   Naseri said rerouting Iranian flights could lead to chaos. ``It
would be the decisions of military commanders somewhere in the
world to place their ships wherever they want and then decide
routes would be adjusted accordingly,'' said Naseri, Iran's U.N.
representative in Geneva.

   A jury on Thursday found a teen-ager innocent of
all charges in the Howard Beach attack by a white gang on three
black men that resulted in the death of a person struck when he was
chased onto a highway.
   Cheers rang out in court as Thomas Gucciardo was acquitted of
attempted murder, assault and riot stemming from the Dec. 20, 1986,
attack. The defendant smiled broadly and hung his head back in
relief.
   A second jury considering lesser charges against four other
defendants continued deliberating.
   Three youths were convicted in an earlier trial of manslaughter
in the death of 23-year-old Michael Griffith, who was struck by a
car and killed on the Belt Parkway as he fled the attackers. A
fourth youth was acquitted at that trial.
   Before the verdict was announced, Gucciardo embraced weeping
relatives, including his parents, Tom and Fran. ``I told them I
loved them,'' he said.
   ``I was scared, but I knew that I hadn't done anything wrong,''
he said after the verdict. He said he was going to ``celebrate,
then go back to school'' at St. John's University.
   ``I'll go home the first time in a year and a half a free man,''
he said.
   The cheers of the spectators in the courtroom, he said, gave him
``the greatest feeling I ever had in my life.''
   He said Howard Beach was not a racist neighborhood. ``There's no
racism there. One incident _ how can you say there's racism.''
   But Jean Griffith, whose son died on the parkway, was bitter.
``This is not justice,'' she said.
   ``Nobody knows the pain of what we're going through. For me, I
have nothing ... I lost everything. My son is dead,'' she said.
   Ed Boyar, an assistant special prosecutor, would not find fault
with the jury, which included two black people.
   ``We picked the jury. We believed they would be fair-minded
people. For me to criticize their verdict would be worse than sour
grapes,'' he said.
   Gucciardo had been charged with beating Cedric Sandiford with a
tree limb during the attack. Sandiford, 37, testified during the
trial that he was beaten by the white gang until he feigned
unconsciousness.
   The Gucciardo jury began its deliberations Tuesday morning.
   A second jury deciding the fate of William Bollander, Thomas
Farino and James Povinelli, all 18, and John Saggese, 20, began its
deliberations Wednesday. All are charged with riot.
   Does the Gucciardo verdict bode well for the other defendants?
``I hope to God it does. I hope our jury sees it the way this jury
does,'' said Povinelli.
   Two other teen-agers pleaded guilty to riot charges just prior
to the second trial.

   Here is the text of a final statement read
Thursday by Dr. Assad Kotaite, president of the Council of the
International Civil Aviation Organization, on the Council's
decision in response to Iranian complaints following a U.S. missile
attack on an Iran Air jet that killed 290 people:
   
   First, the Council duly considered the request by the Islamic
Republic of Iran concerning the shooting downing on 3 July 1988 of
Iran Air Airbus A300 on flight Iran Air 655. 2. The Council
expressed profound regret over the loss of 290 lives. 3. The
Council expressed its deepest sympathy and condolences to the
government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and to the bereaved
families of the victims of this tragic event. 4. The Council
deplored the use of weapons against a civil aircraft. 5. The
Council reaffirmed the fundamental principle that states must
refrain from resorting to the use of weapons against civil
aircraft; it also appealed to all states which have not yet done so
to ratify as soon as possible the protocol introducing Article
3-bis into the Convention on International Civil Aviation; it also
strongly urged all states to refrain from any action which might
jeopardize the safety of civil aviation in the area. 6. The Council
directed the secretary general to institute an immediate
fact-finding investigation to determine all relevant facts and
technical aspects of the chain of events relating to the flight and
destruction of the aircraft. 7. The Council urged all parties
concerned to cooperate fully in the investigation. 8. The president
of the Council and the secretary general should present a full
report to the Council as early as possible during the 125th session
of the Council in September 1988. 9. The Council directed the
president of the Council and secretary general a) to continue their
efforts with all states concerned for the earliest possible
establishment of suitable arrangements for the proper coordination
of civil flight operations and military activities within the area
so as to fully safeguard the safety of civil air navigation, b) to
take all necessary measures in cooperation with the states
concerned to improve the routing arrangements in the area so as to
facilitate safe operation of civil air traffic, c) to undertake
immediately all necessary studies for the improvement of the
standards and recommended practises to prevent the recurrence of
such a tragic incident, d) the president of the council and the
secretary general should report to the Council on the
implementation of a, b and c above as soon as possible.

   House Speaker Jim Wright was ``summoned''
Thursday to testify about misconduct allegations against him at a
mock public trial next week outside the Democratic National
Convention hall in Atlanta.
   A ``subpoena'' for Wright, D-Texas, to testify in his defense
was delivered to Marshall L. Lynam, the speaker's chief of staff,
by Eugene Delgaudio, executive director of Public Advocate, a
conservative-oriented ``citizens action committee.''
   Delgaudio, who wore black judicial robes, presented the summons
to Lynam in the speaker's press office under the watchful eye of
several Capitol Police guards who escorted Delgaudio out of the
building afterward. Delgaudio said he was not allowed to see
Wright, who was working in his office elsewhere in the House wing
of the Capitol.
   Reporters were barred from the office where Delgaudio and Lynam
met. An aide said later that Lynam was not available for comment.
   Delgaudio said members of Congress and convention delegates had
been invited to attend the mock trial Tuesday morning in a parking
lot reserved for demonstrations near the Democratic convention
arena.
   Delgaudio said a trial jury of public citizens will deliver a
verdict on charges against Wright, who will serve as chairman of
the Democratic convention starting Monday.
   The House ethics committee announced June 10 it had voted
unanimously to investigate allegations that Wright had abused the
powers of his office for personal gain and had intervened
improperly with federal bank regulators.
   Wright has denied any wrongdoing and charged that the ethics
complaint filed in May by Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., was
politically motivated.
   Delgaudio said his organization supports the 74 members of
Congress, including Gingrich, who have demanded appointment of an
independent counsel to investigate the allegations against Wright.
   ``We are concerned that a potential abuse of power is being
ignored,'' Delgaudio said. ``There needs to be a full disclosure of
all the facts.''

<HEAD>Bentsen Vows Renewed Trade Push as Panels OK Canadian Agreement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Democrat Lloyd Bentsen, back in the Senate
after a campaign trip, said Thursday that running for vice
president will not distract him from pushing for final approval of
a wide-ranging trade bill.
   ``I'll be taking some of my time to work on that trade bill here
in the Senate,'' the Texan told reporters at a meeting of his
Finance Committee. He said he had ``talked to Governor Dukakis on
that'' and gotten the green light.
   The House approved the sweeping trade bill Wednesday and sent it
to the Senate, where action could follow next week's break for the
Democratic National Convention.
   Some Democrats are saying the decision by Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis to tap Bentsen as his running mate heightens
prospects for Senate approval of the legislation.
   The Finance Committee on Thursday approved a legislative
blueprint for implementing the U.S.-Canadian free trade agreement
approved in January by President Reagan and Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney. The plan also won approval from the House Ways and Means
Committee.
   The nation would phase out tariffs between the two nations over
the next 10 years.
   Under special procedures reserved for international trade pacts,
the administration will now introduce implementing legislation that
follows closely the blueprint drawn up by the two committees.
   Congress, in turn, guarantees the legislation speeded up
consideration with amendments ruled out.
   Administration officials appeared before the committee and
promised that the legislation would not include subsidies for the
U.S. uranium industry, which had been delaying action by the two
committees.
   Neither Bentsen nor Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., was willing to go along with the uranium
subsidy plan. An assortment of other squabbles also were settled
and officials said the path appeared clear for approval of the
agreement and the bill.
   ``We've set an example for the entire world on what can be
accomplished with free trade,'' Bentsen said. ``This is a historic
moment.''
   Rostenkowski issued a statement saying the lawmakers had
``reached agreement among ourselves and with the administration on
the details of the implementing legislation.''
   ``I believe that this consultative process has developed a
sound, well crafted implementing bill, which balances all
interests,'' he said.
   ``It fully carries out our obligations uknder the agreement but
also protects the legitimate intrerests of those few industries
concerned about possible adverse effects on their current business
dealings.''

<HEAD>Doe Deploys Troops in North After Saying Coup Attempt Quashed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president deployed nearly 1,000
troops in northern Liberia on Thursday after announcing that his
forces had quashed a coup attempt by his former second-in-command.
   Troops also set up roadblocks and surrounded key cities in the
northern Nimba County, according to travelers from the region. The
pre-dawn coup attempt was said to have occurred in the county, 350
miles north of Monrovia.
   President Samuel K. Doe described the attempted coup in a speech
to an emergency session of the National Legislature Wednesday night
that wasbroadcast live by state radio. A news release issued
Thursday by the president's mansion elaborated on the announcement.
   Liberian Minister of Information Emmanuel Bower said the
attackers tried to cross the border from the neighboring Ivory
Coast at Sanniquellie, 450 miles northeast of Monrovia.
   The presidential statement said Doe's forces killed and captured
an unspecified number of attackers and prevented 11 others from
crossing the border.
   Doe, 36, assured ``all Liberians and foreigners alike'' that his
government was in ``complete control of the situation and there is
no need to panic.''
   He said the invaders were led by J. Nicholas Podier Jr.,
described as the vice head-of-state of the former governing
People's Redemption Council.
   Doe did not say whether Podier was among those killed. But the
Joint Security Force, which is investigating the coup attempt, said
Podier was killed in the battle and said that his body would be
shown later on state television.
   Doe said the attackers captured in the coup attempt were being
brought to the capital of Monrovia for ``further investigation.''
   Life in Monrovia proceeded as normal Thursday, although some
soldiers were spotted in the city.
   Podier was among 17 enlisted men and non-commissioned officers
led by then-Master Sgt. Doe who seized control of the West African
nation in an April 12, 1980 coup. They stormed the executive
mansion in Monrovia and assassinated President William R. Tolbert.
   Doe and his confederates then set up the People's Redemption
Council, which ruled by decree until 1985 elections returned
Liberia to civilian rule with Doe as president.
   Podier fell from power in 1984 after being accused of plotting
against Doe. Podier went to live in the Ivory Coast in 1986.
   A December 1985 coup attempt led by former People's Redemption
Council member Brig. Gen. Thomas Quiqonkpa brought heavy fighting
into the capital until it was crushed by government forces.
Quiqonkpa claimed to have seized power and held the state-run
Liberia Broadcasting System radio for several hours before being
overpowered. He later was executed.
   On March 22, police arrested 12 people connected with an alleged
plot to assassinate Doe and overthrow his government. They have
been charged with treason and are scheduled to go on trial in
August.

<HEAD>Bush's U.N. Speech Seen As Political Address, Too</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush's speech to the U.N. Security
Council, voicing compassion for victims of a U.S.-downed Iranian
airliner while insisting that Iran share responsiblity, gave the
vice president a forum for displaying traits he has hoped to
project in his White House campaign.
   The high-profile address on Thursday, in which Bush looked
straight at his Iranian accuser and told him ``of course we care,''
was viewed by aides as a demonstration of his leadership,
compassion and foreign-policy credentials.
   Bush's expressions of regret went further than his past reaction
to the downing of the plane, which he previously had called ``just
an unhappy incident'' while telling audiences ``life goes on.''
   ``Anytime you can go and speak forcefully about bringing peace
to this part of the world, it's worth doing,'' said Bush chief of
staff Craig Fuller afterwards. ``He didn't do it for political
reasons. But I do not believe it will be harmful politically.''
   Bush, who was U.S. ambassador to the United Nations from 1971 to
1973, denounced as ``offensive and absurd'' Iranian suggestions
that the downing of Iran Air 635 containing 290 people on July 3
was intentional or reckless.
   And he told the world organization Iran ``must bear a
substantial measure of responsiblity for what has happened'' by
refusing to divert the airliner away from a combat zone.
   ``There are three ways for Iran to avoid future tragedies,''
Bush said. ``Keep airliners away from combat, stop attacking
innocent ships. Or better still, the best way is peace.''
   He called for Iran to immediately adhere to a U.N. resolution
calling for a ceasefire in the region.
   At the same time, the vice president said this nation's reaction
to the accidental downing of the plane ``fills our hearts with
sorrow'' that ``transcends political differences and boundaries.''
   Aides said that Bush's presentation was written by three or four
speechwriters, with most of the ideas for its wording coming from
him. The text was coordinated with both the State Department and
the National Security Council before Bush delivered it, the aides
said.
   Departing from his prepared text, Bush looked across the
semi-circular council table at Iranian Foreign Minister Ali-Akbar
Velayati and said in measured tones, ``Of course we feel badly
about it, or course we have compassion. Of course we care.''
   ``The United States has never willfully acted to endanger
innocent civilians, nor will it ever,'' Bush said.
   ``Contrast this with the willful detention, in inhuman
conditions, of Americans and others held hostage against their
will. One course is civilized; the other barbaric.''
   Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force II on his way to New
York, Bush said President Reagan ``decided to put some real
emphasis on the policy of the United States by elevating the level
of representation.''
   His presentation of the U.S. case to the world forum was one of
Bush's most highly visible assignments as vice president, and it
comes just days before Democrats assemble in Atlanta to formally
select Michael Dukakis as their presidential nominee.
   It was his first speech to the Security Council since he served
there, although he addressed the General Assembly in 1986 in a
ceremony honoring the U.N.'s 40th anniversary.
   Aides said that Bush was pleased with the way his speech went.
   Fuller, his chief-of-staff, declined to say whether the original
idea for the appearance came from the White House or from the Bush
camp. However, Fuller told reporters, ``He had an interest in doing
it. It was very genuine, a reflection of George Bush's commitment
to bring peace to the region.''
   It was Bush's last scheduled public appearance until next
Wednesday, when he begins a six-day campaign swing. He planned to
spend most of the time on a private fishing trip in Wyoming with
Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, a close friend and adviser.
   Speaking with reporters on his plane about the current political
situation, Bush said that he was not troubled by Dukakis' selection
of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, as his running mate altough called
it ``an unusual choice.''
   Asked whether the placement on the ticket of Bentsen, who had
defeated him in a 1970 Senate race, would make him campaign harder
for Texas' 29 electoral votes, Bush said, ``I don't know. I
certainly won't lighten up.''
   ``I plan to spend a lot of time in Texas anyway. I am certainly
not going to take Texas for granted and I will win Texas.''
   ``The race is going to be determined, as I said in 1980 and as I
said in 1984, by the top of the ticket. That's what will determine
it in Texas and elsewhere.''
   Bush also gently rebuked Dukakis for his failure to notify
Democrat Jesse Jackson in advance of his intention to select
Bentsen. ``I don't want to second guess somebody else, but you want
to bend over backwards and be as considerate of other people as
possible in politics,''Bush said.

   The tiniest baby ever to receive a liver
transplant died Thursday, two days after doctors divided a donated
organ between him and another baby in the first U.S. operation of
its type, a spokesman said.
   Twelve-week-old Joseph Kovach died of heart failure at Wyler
Children's Hospital at the University of Chicago Medical Center,
spokesman John Easton said.
   The boy's heart had stopped briefly after the transplant and he
later suffered kidney and lung failure.
   The other baby, a 7-month-old girl, was ``doing very well,'' but
was listed in critical and stable condition, Easton said.
   The Kovach baby, of Geneva, Ill., weighed only 4.2 pounds
Tuesday when he received the transplant, which doctors regarded as
a long-shot for saving his life but his only hope, said his
physician, Peter F. Whitington.
   Joseph had previously undergone open-heart surgery to correct a
birth defect, but his heart was still weak and the stress of the
second operation was too much, Whitington said.
   His death will not discourage subsequent double liver
transplants, which could help other youngsters too small to
accommodate adult livers and likely to die while awaiting scarcer
children's organs, Whitington said.
   ``Technically, this is not a setback. His liver was functioning
very well this morning, even just before he died,'' Whitington
said. ``Of course that is not important to Joseph Kovach.''
   ``What we showed with this pair is that it's clearly technically
feasible,'' Whitington said. ``We did it under the worst of
circumstances ... with a very sick, very small baby that needed a
graft (new organ) we never would have gotten without a reduction''
in the size of the donor organ.
   Double liver transplants have been performed previously in
Europe, involving adult donors, but no double liver transplants had
been done previously in the United States, Easton said.
   Whitington said he told the boy's parents that any complications
at all would result in the child's death, and that ``if it all went
perfectly, there was a small chance he would make it.''
   Joseph suffered from cirrhosis, a type of liver damage that can
exist at birth from an unknown cause.
   He was the first child of Patty and Donald Kovach, a comptroller
for a Chicago firm, Easton said.
   The other youngster, Jaclyn Manrose of Crystal Lake, Ill., had a
hereditary defect called alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, an
insufficent amount of an enzyme that can lead to hepatitis or
cirrhosis.
   Jaclyn is one of three children of Kathleen and Bob Manrose, a
maintenance specialist with United Airlines, Easton said.
   Jaclyn and Joseph received the divided liver of a 1-year-old
Illinois child who died in an accident, the university said.
   Two younger infants have received new livers at the University
of Pittsburgh's transplant center, but both babies _ ages 16 days
and 3 weeks _ weighed more than 6 pounds, Easton said.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has rejected
requests from Illinois Gov. James Thompson and other officials for
increased diversion of water from the Great Lakes into the
drought-parched Mississippi River, an Army official said Thursday.
   ``We do not feel it is necessary to do it at this time,'' said
Robert Page, the Army's assistant secretary for civil works, after
testifying before the Senate merchant marine subcommittee.
   The decision was ``not politically motivated'' and was based on
engineering analyses, Page said.
   He said he wrote Thompson on Thursday to inform the governor of
the decision.
   Page said the decision will be subject to review by President
Reagan but the White House placed responsibility with the corps.
   ``We have talked with the administration about this,'' Page
said. ``It is left strictly up to the Army Corps of Engineers.''
   The decision was in response to Reagan's request that the corps
study the need for diversion, Page said.
   Thompson and officials from states bordering the Mississippi
asked for increased diversion of Great Lakes water after levels on
the river dropped, making the channel unnavigable to barge traffic.
   Barge shippers have estimated losses as a result of the stalled
shipping at up to $60 million. Some 3,000 barges have been stalled
as a result of low water.
   Presently, about 3,000 cubic feet per second are being diverted
from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi. The officials asked that
the rate be increased to 10,000 cubic feet per second for 100 days.
   The governors of four Great Lakes states opposed the diversion,
and only Thompson supported it among the leaders of the eight
states surrounding the lakes.
   Canadian officials also protested the proposed diversion.
   Page said the corps would have the legal authority to increase
the rate of diversion but would do so only after consultation with
Great Lakes states governors.
   Supporters of diversion argued the increased flow out of the
lakes would have a miniscule impact on the Great Lakes but would
have great benefits downriver.
   Opponents argued that the lakes water was needed in the Midwest
and Northeast and that increasing diversion would set an
unacceptable precedent.
   Page said increasing the outflow to 10,000 cubic feet per second
would not do much to help Mississippi navigation, and shoals would
continue to impede the flow of goods.
   He said the corps foresees through the summer ``we will still
have flow'' on the Mississippi.
   ``We see in the foreseeable future based on our forecast we
don't need (increased diversion) at all,'' he said.

   More than 1,000 NAACP members demonstrated
before the South African Embassy on Thursday to protest that
nation's system of racial discrimination, chanting ``let our people
go.''
   The demonstrators lifted up a grey casket into which NAACP
executive director Benjamin Hooks said he was imprisoning the
policies of apartheid, segregation, hatred, discrimination, unjust
treatment and inequality.
   He led the crowd in a pronouncement over the coffin, saying,
``dust to dust, ashes to ashes _ apartheid you'll never rise
again!''
   The coffin was placed into a white hearse as the demonstrators
sang ``Oh, Freedom,'' a song from the civil rights movement.
   Hooks prayed that ``those white folk in South Africa that call
themselves Christians may start acting like Christians and
recognize that they are their brother's keeper ... that we are all
one blood.''
   ``We come here today in the spirit of Walter White, Roy Wilkins,
Martin Luther King ... to say that we won't be satisfied until the
walls of segregation, apartheid and oppression are brought low in
South Africa,'' said the Rev. Jerry Guess, communications director
for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   ``We come today praying that our own pharaoh, who sits at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue, will hear these voices (and realize that) we
cannot exist in this world, half slave and half free,'' Guess said.
   The group gathered at the embassy after a half-hour march in
what was the culmination of South Africa Day at the 79th annual
convention of the NAACP.
   In morning sessions of the conference, Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., and Randall Robinson, head of TransAfrica, a lobby group
for the Caribbean and Africa, urged the delegates to support
legislation to impose stronger economic sanctions on South Africa.

   Striking paper mill workers Thursday called for
a national boycott of Avon Products Inc. because of the cosmetics
manufacturer's ties to International Paper Co.
   The link is Stanley Gault, who serves on the board of directors
of both companies in addition to his position as chairman and chief
executive officer of Rubbermaid.
   ``Avon is a corporate ally of International Paper,'' said Wayne
Glenn, president of the United Paperworkers International Union.
The union represents 8,000 IP workers who for more than a year have
been on strike, locked out or working without a contract at 17
plants across the country.
   The union is calling on women not to buy Avon cosmetics.
   ``Avon and International Paper are two separate companies,''
said Avon spokesman John Cox. The mutual board member is the ``only
tenuous link between the two companies. ... We think the boycott is
unwarranted.''
   Gault, who was in meetings all day and could not be reached, has
not been approached about resigning from the Avon board, Cox said.
   Gault, who was elected to the board in 1985, also got support
from IP, which said, ``Gault is an outside director, whose
independent judgment International Paper values highly.''
   IP spokesman Bill Fuller in a statement said the boycott was ``a
distraction from coming to grips with the things that have to be
done to put the disputes behind us.''
   Federal law generally prohibits picketing of neutral employers,
but an April Supreme Court decision said the law does not ban
non-picketing activities aimed at such businesses.
   ``The Supreme Court decision allows us to hold each of IP's
allies directly accountable,'' Glenn said, also reading from a
statement.
   The union is studying the affiliations of all 15 IP directors,
according to Bob Frase, Glenn's spokesman.
   The Avon boycott is the union's first national effort, but
several local boycotts are under way.
   The Bank of Boston is being boycotted because one of its
directors, Donald McHenry, also serves on the IP board.
   In Pennsylvania, the union has launched a boycott of the PNC
Financial Corp. W. Craig McClelland heads IP's Hammermill
subsidiary and sits on the board of PNC Financial.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Seeks Court Order to Get Handwriting Samples</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh on
Thursday sought a court order to obtain handwriting samples from
former national security adviser John M. Poindexter and two arms
dealers charged in the Iran-Contra conspiracy case.
   Walsh also sought to obtain photographs of Poindexter and the
two arms dealers _ Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen.
Richard V. Secord _ to show to prospective witnesses in the case.
   The handwriting samples were needed, Walsh said, because had had
obtained ``numerous documents believed to contain the handwriting
of the various defendants.''
   Poindexter, Hakim and Secord are charged along with fired White
House aide Oliver L. North with conspiring to defraud the
government by diverting profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to
the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   Walsh noted that he had already obtained samples of North's
handwriting, as a result of a grand jury subpoena that was the
subject of a lengthy court battle last year.
   North, who was cited for contempt of court for refusing to
supply handwriting samples, challenged Walsh's legal authority to
obtain grand jury subpoenas. A federal appeals court upheld Walsh's
authority and enforced the subpoena.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell has ordered four separate
trials and scheduled North's to begin Sept. 20.
   In seeking the handwriting samples from the three defendants,
Walsh said ``it is well settled that a defendant has no valid claim
of privilege with respect to handwriting examplars.''
   ``Similarly, the government is entitled to take photographs of
the defendants, since it is well-established that neither the
Fourth nor the Fifth Amendment offers any protection against
compulsion to submit to such photographs.''
   In a related case, U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr.
approved the security procedures proposed by Walsh for handling
thousands of pages of documents in the case against former CIA
agent Joseph F. Fernandez.
   Fernandez, who operated in Central America under the code-name
Tomas Castillo, is accused of conspiring to set up an illegal
arms-supply network to the Nicaraguan rebels and subsequently lying
to cover up his activities.
   The order states that classified documents can only be examined
in the security facility under supervision of a court security
officer. The same facility was constructed by the Justice
Department to house documents turned over to the defendants in the
other Iran-Contra case.

   Iran said Thursday the USS Vincennes did
not warn an Iranian airliner before shooting it down, but Vice
President George Bush responded in the Security Council that the
warship fired in self-defense.
   Foreign Minister Ali-Akbar Velayati of Iran called the
destruction of the airliner and the 290 civilians aboard July 3
``the most inhumane military attack in the history of civilian
aviation ... a barbaric massacre.''
   Bush said Iran should not have sent the Airbus into a Persian
Gulf battle zone. The Vincennes and the USS Elmer Montgomery had
skirmished with Iranian attack boats just before the jetliner
entered the area.
   The vice president, who said he was delivering ``the free
world's case,'' called the destruction of the airliner a ``terrible
human tragedy'' but said the United States has a ``legal right'' to
protect Persian Gulf shipping lames.
   ``We have made it clear that we will keep the gulf open, no
matter what the threat,'' he said. ``We will not alter our course.''
   Velayati read a purported transcript of a communication between
Iran Air Flight 655, flying from a military-civilian airport at
Bandar Abbas, Iran, across the Strait of Hormuz to Dubai in the
United Arab Emirates, and the Bandar Abbas control tower just
before the attack.
   He said the tower told the pilot ``Have a nice day,'' he
replied, ``Thank you. Good day,'' and the controller answered,
``Good day.''
   The United States says the Airbus A300 did not respond to
repeated questioning by the Vincennes about its identity and the
cruiser's captain believed it was an Iranian F-14 fighter
transmitting ambiguous signals and descending in attack pattern.
   In a detailed, two-hour speech, Velayati said the Airbus never
heard warnings from the Vincennes, the plane transmitted only
unambiguous civilian signals, it remained in the recognized
international air corridor and was climbing when the missiles were
fired.
   ``Every available evidence ... shows that the pilot of the
airliner did not receive any warning,'' he told the 15-member
council.
   ``One question is whether the captain of the Vincennes actually
warned the target that it intended to shoot ... or whether it
simply decided to shoot on a target which was admittedly
unidentified at the very least,'' he said.
   Another question, Velayati said, ``is why a warship had
positioned itself right at the center of a civilian airway.''
   ``The shooting down of an Iranian civil airliner, flying on a
scheduled flight known to the U.S. warships, and using an
internationally established and published civilian airway and
transmitting signals identifying itself as a civilian airliner
could not have been a mistake,'' he said.
   Iran requested the council meeting to seek condemnation of the
U.S. action and demand withdrawal of all American forces from the
Persian Gulf, but has been unable to enlist a majority to support a
resolution.
   It had boycotted the Security Council previously, claiming it
was biased against Iran in the Iran-Iraq war.
   The meeting was adjourned after Velayati and Bush spoke, and
neither commented later on the other's speech. The council session,
with at least 15 speakers scheduled, is to resume at 10:30 a.m.
Friday and U.N. officials said it could last through the weekend.
   It was Bush's first speech to the council since he was
Washington's U.N. ambassador in 1971-1973.
   An appearance by a U.S. vice president is rare. U.S. officials
said the purpose was to lend weight to U.S. arguments about the
tragedy and emphasize the need to end the 8-year-old war.
   Observers said the speech by Bush, the certain Republican
nominee for president, would emphasize his foreign policy
credentials and statesmanship.
   Bush did not dwell on details of the event in his 30-minute
address, but defended the U.S. presence in the gulf and the
decision of the ship's captain. He urged Iran and Iraq to accept a
year-old, U.N. cease-fire resolution immediately.
   ``The critical issue confronting this body is not the how and
why of Iran Air 655,'' Bush declared. ``It is the continuing
refusal of Iran to comply with Resolution 598, to negotiate an end
to the war with Iraq and to cease its acts of aggression against
neutral shipping in the Persian Gulf.''
   ``I will not dignify with a response the charge that we
deliberately destroyed Iran Air 655,'' the vice president. ``I call
on Iran today to reroute civilian air traffic away from areas of
active hostilities.
   ``Iran allowed a civilian aircraft loaded with passengers to
proceed on a path over a warship engaged in battle. That was
irresponsible and a tragic error.''
   ``After seven unanswered warnings,'' he said, the captain ``did
what he had to do to protect his ship and the lives of his crew.''
   Bush said the underlying cause of the airline disaster was
Iran's refusal to accept a cease-fire. Iraq says it will accept the
Security Council cease-fire resolution if Iran does, but the
Iranians say no truce is possible until Iraq is branded the
aggressor.
   Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after several border
skirmishes.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis is the Democratic nominee-to-be,
but Jesse Jackson is getting all the attention _ at least in the
week before the national convention.
   Dukakis tended state business in Boston on Thursday, while
Jackson launched a three-day bus trip from Chicago to Atlanta to
wrap up his presidential campaign.
   Dukakis made private phone calls seeking reconciliation with
Jackson. Jackson made public requests for mediation by former
president Jimmy Carter.
   You'd almost think Jackson is the one who won the nomination and
Dukakis is the also-ran.
   And that's precisely the trap the Massachusetts governor must
avoid.
   Above all, Dukakis needs to come out the Atlanta convention next
Friday looking like a man in control of his party and of his own
destiny.
   Because Dukakis is still a relative unknown to millions of
voters, the sights and impressions from the four nights of
convention activities on the television screens of America will
play a major role in shaping the voters' thoughts.
   The last thing Dukakis needs next week is a constant drumbeat of
questions about ``What will Jesse do?'' competing with the music
inside the convention hall.
   It is certain that Dukakis doesn't need Jackson's votes inside
the Omni next week to run the convention _ the Massachusetts
governor has plenty of delegates to stay in charge.
   But Dukakis does need the votes of millions of Jackson's
supporters outside the hall to beat Republican George Bush on Nov.
8.
   At the same time, he must avoid the appearance that he is
pandering to Jackson, or caving in to the civil rights leader's
demands.
   The appearance of pandering to Jackson and his supporters
damaged Walter Mondale in his 1984 campaign for the White House,
planting doubts about Mondale's toughness and his ability to handle
the demands of special interests.
   On Thursday, Jackson demonstrated once again why it is so hard
to negotiate with this man who has honed the tools of public
relations and electronic media into powerful bargaining tools.
   The preacher-turned-politician demanded center stage again with
a single stroke.
   It grabs the headlines with a well-known name.
   It puts two prominent men on the spot _ Dukakis and Carter.
   Carter would certainly like to be helpful, but how to do so is a
tricky question.
   Dukakis can't very well ignore a former president, but he surely
doesn't want Carter involved in this, either. Intermediaries just
complicate things.
   Moreover, Democrats don't really want Carter in the spotlight
very long at this convention.
   The memories of Carter's years in the White House are not ones
that Dukakis and Democrats want to revive. Soaring prices, gasoline
lines and Iranian hostages were not a pretty picture.
   This latest squabble between the campaigns may simply turn out
to be a little entertainment before the main event.
   Jackson gets to town on Saturday afternoon and Dukakis on
Sunday. The two will probably meet privately.
   What is said at the meeting _ and the pictures that the nation
sees after it _ could well set the tone for the entire convention.

<TEXT>
   South African and Cuban
officials said Thursday that major issues remain unresolved
following a milestone agreement aimed at easing conflict in Angola
and South-West Africa.
   South Africa's foreign minister, Roelof F. Botha, said President
P.W. Botha, who are not related, will preside over a government
meeting next week to decide whether to accept the principles agreed
upon by delegates after three days of talks in New York.
   A Cuban official in New York said a U.S. mediator's assertion
that agreement in principle had been reached on a Cuban withdrawal
from Angola was ``inexact.'' This issue remained under discussion,
the Cuban said.
   State Department and South African officials at the United
Nations in New York, however, on Thursday called it merely a matter
of semantics. They said Cuba did agree to bring its troops home,
but expressed that in a ``statement of principles,'' not in what
diplomats would call an ``agreement.''
   The officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
   On Wednesday, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker
said Angolan, Cuban and South African negotiators agreed on a set
of principles aimed at removing Cuban troops from Angola and ending
South Africa's 73-year rule over South-West Africa, also known as
Namibia.
   The agreement will be referred back to the three governments. If
they approve, another round of negotiations probably would be held
next month.
   The negotiators did not resolve the most contentious issue _ a
timetable for the Cuban withdrawal and implementation of U.N.
Resolution 435, which outlines a procedure for granting
independence to Namibia.
   On Thursday, a Cuban delegate differed with Crocker's account of
the talks.
   ``It is not precise to say that an agreement has been reached on
the withdrawal of Cuban troops,'' said Alcibiades Hidalgo, a member
of the Central Committee of Cuba's Communist Party.
   ``This issue ... is part of all the discussions, is part of a
process that is continuing,'' he said. ``It is our opinion that we
made substantial progress.''
   The agreement, linking the withdrawal of Cuban forces from
Angola to South African withdrawal from Namibia, received low-key
treatment in South Africa.
   ``The road is still far that we have to travel, but as of now
the momentum and confidence have been established to enable us to
continue,'' Neil van Heerden, director-general of foreign affairs
and head of the South African delegation, was quoted as saying.
   Crocker said the negotiators in New York decided it was not yet
time to address the timing of the Cuban withdrawal.
   South Africa and the United States would like to see the
estimated 50,000 Cubans leave Angola within a year, the same
timetable the United Nations has suggested for South African
withdrawal from Namibia.
   The Cubans and Angolans have said in the past it would take four
years, and that South African and American military support for the
UNITA guerrillas must end first. UNITA stands for the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
   One of the first steps would be withdrawal of South African
troops from Angola. South Africa has said it has a maximum of about
3,000 troops in Angola, while its foes claimed 9,000 South Africans
were there last year fighting alongside UNITA.
   More than 45 white South African soldiers have died in Angola in
the past year, and each death brings more domestic pressure on the
government to justify its military policy.
   Crocker said the South African administration in Namibia would
be replaced by U.N. civil and military administrators to comply
with U.N. Resolution 435. South Africa has said it would accept the
resolution only after the Cubans leave Angola.
   In Washington, U.N. Ambassador Vernon Walters told ``CBS This
Morning'' that many obstacles remain.
   ``This war has been going on for 15 years. There's a whole lot
of hostility built up,'' he said.
   The United States was a party to the talks because it has been
supporting UNITA with funds and weapons since 1985.
   Asked if the United States would continue backing the rebels,
Walters said, ``That's a decision taken in the light of
circumstances.''
   The 13-year-old civil war in Angola, despite the presence of
Cuban and South African troops, is chiefly between the Marxist
government forces and UNITA.
   In Namibia, the South-West African Peoples Organization has been
fighting a guerrilla war for 22 years to end South African
occupation and gain control of an independent government.

<HEAD>Nicaraguan Immigrant Asks For Help To Bury Children Struck By
Driver</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Lead planned after arraignment, scheduled to begin 5:30 p.m.

<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Nicaraguan immigrant pleaded for
financial help Thursday to bury his son and niece, killed by a
speeding hit-and-run driver who plowed into a group of about 20
children crossing a street outside a school.
   Police said the driver was angry because his friends made him
late to work.
   ``We are asking for help for the funeral for the babies because
we don't have the money for that,'' said Rene Zuniga.
   Zuniga, an unemployed janitor who fled Nicaragua eight months
ago to find a better life, ran from his apartment to the side of
his 10-year-old son, Rene Zuniga Jr., after the boy was struck
Tuesday in a crosswalk outside an elementary school, witnesses said.
   Rene Jr. and his 8-year-old cousin, Carla Rosales, were
pronounced dead at a hospital. Carla's 6-year-old sister, Angela,
who also was struck, was in good condition Thursday at Children's
Hospital. A 12-year-old crossing guard, Magalia Dominquez, was
treated for a broken collarbone and released from the hospital
Wednesday.
   Prosecutors said they would file charges against Michael Dwayne
Brandon, 21, of Oakland, who they allege was speeding up to 50 mph
when he plowed into the children.
   Brandon, a temporary janitor with Bay Area Rapid Transit, was
being held without bail on two counts of murder, two of assault and
one of assaulting a police officer who tried to stop the fleeing
car.
   Zuniga, whose other son, Christopher, 9, was unhurt, said
through an interpreter that he left his wife behind when he fled
political pressures in his homeland.
   ``I don't know if my wife will be able to come to the funeral.
... We don't have money for that either,'' said Zuniga, who shares
the apartment with his brother and uncle.
   Brandon had picked up two friends and stopped at a neighborhood
store, police said. While he was inside, his companions decided to
drive the car around the block.
   When they returned, according to police Officer Michael
Oliveira, Brandon shouted: ``I'm gonna show you. I'm going to teach
you what gets me. I don't like to be late for work.''
   Brandon swerved around a car that was stopped while the young
crossing guard helped children across the street, police said.
   ``A car was coming fast, and then all the kids were walking
across the street,'' said Janet Lopez, 7. ``And then they were hit.
Bam. There was blood. Some people were crying.''
   The driver hit a parked car and the trio stopped to look at the
injured children before fleeing, the driver in the car and the
passengers on foot.
   An Alameda police officer, in Oakland to make an unrelated
arrest, stood in the path of the car with his revolver drawn and
jumped out of the way at the last moment as the car sped by, said
Lt. Jim Hahn.
   Brandon was taken into custody at his house Tuesday evening.
   Cora Rosales, mother of the Carla and Angela, watched her
2-year-old son Thursday while awaiting word on Angela.
   ``We came here for a better future for the children, a better
education for them,'' she said.
   She and her husband and mother, who work as janitors, have
shared her mother's apartment in the working-class neighborhood
since arriving three years ago. Zuniga lives in the apartment below.
   ``We raised those children like brothers and sisters, they were
that close,'' said their gramdmother, Wilma Loaisiga.
   All had been warned repeatedly about the dangers of traffic.
   ``We always told them, `Look before you cross the street, always
hold hands when you cross the street.' ... Christopher he was
always in front or behind, he wouldn't hold hands. He was the only
one not hurt,'' said Loaisiga.

   A Cuban official on Thursday called
``inexact'' a U.S. statement saying Cuban negotiators reached
agreement in principle to withdraw Cuba's troops from Angola.
   But State Department and South African officials said it was
just a matter of semantics _ that Cuba did agree to bring its
troops home, but expressed that view in a ``statement of
principles,'' not in what diplomats would call an ``agreement.''
   The officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Cuban, Angolan, and South African negotiators initialed a
statement of principles Wednesday calling for Cuban troops to leave
the Marxist-ruled southern African nation of Angola and for South
Africa to end its 73-year rule over Namibia, said Chester Crocker,
the U.S. mediator for the talks.
   They did not agree on a timetable for the Cuban withdrawal at
private meetings this week, said Crocker, the State Department
undersecretary for African affairs, on Wednesday.
   Alcibiades Hidalgo, a Cuban negotiator and member of the Central
Committee of Cuba's Communist Party, said Thursday:
   ``I would say it is not precise to say that an agreement has
been reached on the withdrawal of Cuban troops.
   ``This issue ... is part of all the discussions, is part of a
process that is continuing. I would qualify it as inexact to say
that an agreement has been reached on the withdrawal of all Cuban
troops.''
   ``It is our opinion that we made substantial progress.''
   Hidalgo spoke in Spanish through an interpreter at a news
conference at the Cuban Mission to the United Nations.
   A State Department official on Thursday saw no real
contradiction, saying, ``We have never used the term `agreement'.
What the Cubans agreed to is a set of principles. It doesn't
constitute a specific agreement.''
   The principles agreed to must now be signed by the Angolan,
Cuban, and South African governments.
   Military and political experts from those countries will meet in
August to work out details for a comprehensive settlement.
   A South African diplomat noted that the document Cuba initialed
refers to ``a peaceful settlement in southwestern Africa'' _
showing that a settlement of the southern Angola problem is part of
the set of principles.
   South Africa has said it would accept a U.N. Security Council
resolution calling for the independence of South-West Africa,
commonly called Namibia, when the estimated 50,000 Cuban troops
withdraw from neighboring Angola.
   The U.S. goal is a full Cuban troop withdrawal in one year, the
same time span that U.N. Resolution 435 sets for granting
independence to Namibia.
   Angola and Cuba had insisted that Cuban withdrawal take place
over four years.
   The United States was a party to the talks because it has been
supporting anti-communist rebels in Angola with funds and weapons
since 1985.
   Angola has been fighting a civil war since it gained
independence from Portugal in 1975, battling anti-communist rebels
in the south who call themselves UNITA, for National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola.
   South Africa has repeatedly sent troops from Namibia into Angola
to support UNITA forces in the fighting.
   South Africa has ruled Namibia since World War I under a League
of Nations mandate to administer the territory. The League's
successor, the United Nations, revoked that mandate.
   The four parties began their meetings in London last May.

<HEAD>Producers, Consumers Vie for Seats on Energy Regulatory Panel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee started staking out consumer-vs.-producer
positions Thursday for seats on the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission.
   The manuevering found the senior Republican on the panel lined
up with producing-state Democrats in an impasse that, if not
resolved, could leave the commission paralyzed for lack of a quorum.
   The occasion was a hearing on the nomination of Elizabeth Anne
Moler to the commission, whose confirmation senators said is not in
question. She is a 12-year veteran natural gas expert on the
committee staff who is supported by all the committee members.
   The five-member commission regulates natural gas pipelines, some
wellhead gas pricing, oil pipelines, hydro-electric dams and
wholesale electricity sales, and oversees state regulation of small
power producers. The commission must always have a 3-2 party split,
currently in favor of the Republicans.
   Members may serve for up to a year after their four-year terms
expire if no successor has been confirmed.
   If confirmed, Ms. Moler would replace Democrat Charles Stalon,
who has been serving since his term expired last October.
   Despite a warning from Committee Chairman Bennett Johnston,
D-La., and ranking Republican James McClure, R-Idaho, that Stalon
could not be confirmed again, President Reagan nominated Stalon to
fill a vacant seat formerly held by a Texas Democrat for a term
expiring in October 1989.
   ``If you look at the composition of the commission, it's obvious
there is a demand for a seat for a producing-state Democrat,'' and
confirmation of Stalon and Moler would leave no room for one,
McClure told reporters after the hearing. He said he hoped Stalon's
nomination would be withdrawn.
   Stalon is an economist from Illinois and former member of that
state's Commerce Commission who was the chief architect behind the
commission's regulations encouraging natural gas pipelines to
transmit gas for all comers. He has stongly pushed deregulatory
initiatives for electricity generation.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, has backed Stalon as a needed
voice for consumers on the commission. He said he was forwarding an
endorsement of Stalon by 19 senators of both parties.
   ``Clearly he has served the commission well as a voice of
moderation and balance among the competing interests of the energy
regulatory area,'' Metzenbaum said.
   Johnston said he believed the commission should go slow on
current proposed regulations aimed at making it easier for
independent electric generators _ those without transmission or
retail networks _ to do business. This initiative is opposed by
most utilities but strongly backed by a minority of companies.
   FERC Chairwoman Martha Hesse is known to be eager to get the
proposals adopted, and Stalon supports her. Commissioner Charles
Trabandt is opposed.
   Commissioner Anthony Sousa has not taken a position and is
expected to leave the commission this summer.
   Thus, if Ms. Moler replaced Stalon and Stalon were not confirmed
for the vacancy, she could find herself the swing vote on the issue.

<HEAD>Excerpts of Iranian Foreign Minister's Speech</HEAD>
<HEAD>With Airliner-UN Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts of the speech to the
Security Council on Thursday by Foreign Minister Ali-Akbar Velayati
of Iran, delivered in Farsi and translated by the Iranian Mission:
   In the morning of Sunday July 2, 1988, families and friends of
290 passengers and crew said farewell to their loved ones in Tehran
and Bandar Abbas airports _ unaware of the dastardly attack that
awaited them, unaware of the tragic destiny that would be imposed
upon them by a reckless and incompetent naval force led by
aggressive and expansionist policy-makers.
   According to the transcript of the communication between the
pilot and Bandar Abbas tower, before permission for takeoff was
granted the tower asked the pilot to make sure that his transponder
was turned on. Positive response from the pilot was received.
   The plane was flying on a scheduled flight using the
internationally established and published Amber 59 airway that is
used at least 14 times a week, five of which between the same two
airports. The plane was then climbing to the prescribed altitude at
about 320 knots per hour.
   Seconds after the last communication between the plane and the
tower, the plane was targeted by two surface-to-air Standard guided
missiles from USS Vincennes, the most technologically sophisticated
naval ship. ... The plane ws shot when it was at the center line of
Amber 59 airway.
   USS Vincennes had well over 14 minutes _ and not four minutes as
American officials have claimed _ of prior knowledge that the
target was a civilian airliner on a scheduled flight from Bandar
Abbas to Dubai.
   Another story which was fabricated to misguide the international
public opinion was the claim by the United States that the airliner
was not transmitting the appropriate signals.
   Adm. Crowe claimed on July 3, 1988: ``There were electronic
indications on Vincennes that led it to believe that the aircraft
was an F-14.''
   Notwithstanding the fact that the Iranian air force had no F-14
operations in the morning of that unfortunate Sunday in or around
the Strait of Hormuz, it may be noted that the military experts
well-familiar with F-14 and its capabilities have held that F-14
could not have presented any serious danger to the USS Vincennes or
any surface target for that matter.
   F-14 fighters, as it should be known most vividly to the
Americans who made them, are designed for air-to-air attack and not
air-to-surface operations.
   Possibly the most fallacious argument of the American officials
in justifying their inexplicable crime was a claim that the
airliner did not respond to the alleged warnings issued by the
warship.
   While every available evidence including the transcripts read
earlier show that the pilot of the airliner did not receive any
warning, many have contended that in such a short and routine
flight, the pilot was not indeed required to monitor the emergency
civilian frequency.
   Furthermore, because the ship failed to identify the target of
its alleged warnings, the pilot of the airliner of a scheduled
flight should not have reasonably taken it as directed against
himself.
   Finally, the most awkward American explanation for shooting down
a civilian airliner was presented by Adm. Crowe, who claimed that
the plane was coming onto the USS Vincennes in a war zone, while
descending and increasing speed of 450 miles an hour.
   It is necessary to note that the area where the plane was
attacked is well outside the declared war zones of the combatants.
This fact is attested to even by Lloyd's of London.
   The question that needs to be asked is why a warship had
positioned itself right at the center of a civilian airway.
Furthermore, positioning itself right in the middle of an
international civil airway, it is ironic that the ship expected the
plane to go outside of the corridor, not be coming onto the
Vincennes.
   All available evidence suggest(s) that the shooting down of an
Iranian civil airliner ... could not have been a mistake. Certainly
the huge difference in appearance, size, weight, and flight pattern
between an Airbus and those of an F-14, whic is almost a fourth of
the former, would make any claim of mistaken identity absurd.
   Rather, the course of events during that day clearly shows that
the U.S. warships in the area had clear aggressive intentions,
which resulted in the massacre of 290 innocent people.

<HEAD>Bentsen Won't Be Drawn Into Jackson-Dukakis Rift</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>

   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen refused Thursday to be
drawn into the rift between Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis,
saying it's up to Dukakis to mend relations between the two camps.
   Smoothing over tensions with Jackson is ``Gov. Dukakis'
responsiblity,'' said Bentsen, who was selected for the running
mate spot Jackson had coveted.
   ``I know he (Dukakis) has a high regard for Reverend Jackson. I
assume he'll have a meeting with Jackson,'' Bentsen said in a
session with reporters from his home state.
   ``Once again, that's a matter of communication with Reverend
Jackson,'' he said.
   Bentsen said he had no plans to meet personally with Jackson,
who was irked at learning of Bentsen's selection Tuesday from
reporters before he heard from Dukakis. Bentsen did, however, call
Jackson on Wednesday, and described it as ``a good conversation ...
a personal conversation.''
   Jackson received an apology Thursday from one of Dukakis' top
advisers, but said he was still asking former President Carter to
intercede. On Wednesday, Jackson said the floor was ``wide open''
on the vice presidential vote next Thursday night at the Democratic
National Convention in Atlanta.
   Bentsen said ``it's up to Jackson to decide'' whether to stage a
floor fight over the vice presidential nomination.
   Bentsen, a conservative Democrat whose positions differ greatly
from those of Dukakis on such issues as an oil import fee, aid to
the Nicaraguan contras, and the death penalty, said he was
``looking for a good exchange of communication'' with the
Massachusetts governor.
   But, ``We're in accord on job creation, education, child care,
health care, having babies born with sound minds and bodies. These
are the things we share,'' Bentsen said.
   Bentsen, who once said the office of vice president was an empty
job, has changed his mind and is convinced Dukakis wants and will
treat him as a trusted adviser.
   Bentsen said he consulted with Dukakis' former lieutenant
governor, John Kerry, and studied ``the character of the man, not
diagrams and charts,'' before accepting the job.
   ``That was my major question. Was I really going to be able to
communicate, counsel and advise,'' Bentsen said. ``I kept checking
and studying ... and became convinced it could be a meaningful
job.''
   And Dukakis has assured him ``he very much wants to have my
input,'' Bentsen said. ``People told me that was his nature.''
   Bentsen believes he was chosen Dukakis' running mate because of
his legislative experience ``which exposes you to so many facets of
this country of ours,'' his proven ability to work with Congress,
and his exposure though the years to various heads of state.
   A senator since 1970, Bentsen is being opposed in his
re-election bid this year by Rep. Beau Boulter, a Republican.
Bentsen is legally allowed to run both races under a law passed in
Texas that allowed Lyndon B. Johnson to run for vice president with
John F. Kennedy as well as the Senate.
   Bentsen believes he and Dukakis will take Texas and its trove of
29 electoral votes as they campaign against adopted Texan George
Bush.
   ``I think it will be close. I think it will be tough, but I
think we'll win it,'' Bentsen said.
   ``Vamos a ver,'' he said in Spanish for ``We're going to see.''

<HEAD>Iran Says Last Words To Airbus Pilot Were `Have A Nice Day'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Airliner-UN, Bjt</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Shortly before Flight 655 was shot out of the
sky above the Persian Gulf on July 3, the Bandar Abbas tower had
these words of cheer for the departed Iran Air flight with 290
people aboard: ``Have a nice day.''
   Flight 655 responded: ``Thank you. Good day.''
   Tower: ``Good day.''
   That was at 10:24 a.m.
   Then nothing.
   Iran presented Thursday to the Security Council what it said was
a 14-minute transcript of communications in English between the
Iranian Airbus and control towers in Bandar Abbas, where it took
off; Tehran, where it originated, and Dubai in the United Arab
Emirates, its destination.
   Iran's foreign minister, Ali-Akbar Velayati, said the USS
Vincennes must have heard the same communications, which clearly
identified the craft as a civilian airliner. Velayati said the
plane is identified, its altitude and course given, its destination
known and its transponder was on and transmitting its identity on
an internationally recognized civilian channel.
   ``Based on these easily verifiable facts,'' Valayati said, ``USS
Vincennes had well over 14 minutes _ and not four minutes as
American officials have claimed _ of prior knowledge that the
target was a civilian airliner on a scheduled flight from Bandar
Abbas to Dubai.''
   The transcript begins at 10:10 a.m., Bandar Abbas time, when the
pilot requests permission to start up his engine.
   The tower asked the pilot to make sure his transponder was
turned on and the pilot said it was.
   The plane took off at 10:17 a.m. for Dubai _ seven minutes after
the initial contact with the tower.
   The last communication between the pilot and Bandar Abbas tower
was recorded at 10:24 a.m., a routine exchange when the pilot did
not report any unusual or emergency condition.
   Vice President George Bush told the council the Vincennes' crew
sent seven unaswered warnings to the airliner before shooting it
down, believing it to be an F-14 on an attack course.
   ``One question that needs to be seriously examined,'' Velayati
said, ``is whether the captain of the USS Vincennes actually warned
its target that it intended to shoot ... or whether it simply
decided to shoot on a target which was admittedly unidentified at
the very least.''

<TEXT>
   Jackie Presser's handpicked choice to succeed
him and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters' top official in
New England are locked in what labor sources say is a tight race
for the union's presidency.
   The Teamsters' 17-member General Executive Board meets here
Friday to pick a successor to Presser, who died last Saturday
following 18 months of treatment for cancer. Presser, 61, had been
the Teamsters' president since 1983.
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, several sources said the
next Teamsters' president may get the post with a margin of only
one vote.
   Weldon Mathis, the Teamsters' secretary-treasurer and acting
president since May under an appointment from Presser, was expected
months ago to win election easily to the top job upon Presser's
death.
   But that was before a large rank-and-file rebellion over terms
of the union's two largest contracts with United Parcel Service and
the interstate trucking industry. Both were declared ratified even
though they were voted down by a majority of the covered members.
   Mathis is on the executive board along with 16 Teamster vice
presidents, many of whom at some time during the past two months
had seen themselves as succeeding Presser.
   In the past week, the competition to lead the nation's largest
union _ one in every 75 American workers is a Teamster, for a
membership of 1.6 million _ has evolved into a two-man race between
Mathis and William J. McCarthy of Boston, sources close to the
union said Thursday.
   Forces aligned with 70-year-old Joseph Trerotola of New York,
the union's ranking vice president and head of its East Coast
operations since 1969, have united behind McCarthy, sources said
Thursday.
   ``The Presser forces have lined up behind Mathis and the
Trerotola forces have lined up behind McCarthy,'' one source said.
``Everyone's reading is that it is real close.''
   McCarthy, 68, is said by several sources to have the support of
at least seven board members other than himself.
   Mathis, 62, whose career with the Teamsters began in Atlanta, is
believed to have an equal number, although one source said he has
``solidified support since May.''
   Another source described the contest as ``pretty close'' but
added that all 17 board members appeared to have made up their
minds on which way they would vote when they were last together at
Presser's funeral Tuesday in Cleveland.
   Breaking union tradition, McCarthy has been an outspoken critic
of the new three-year National Master Freight Agreement covering
some 200,000 Teamsters in the trucking industry.
   According to one source, Mathis offered during a board meeting
two weeks ago in Montreal to support McCarthy for the No. 2 job but
McCarthy declined.
   Whatever the count is in the closed-door meeting Friday, the
Teamsters are expected to follow their customary practice and
announce a unanimous vote for the winner when it all is over.
   That is what happened in 1983 when Presser was elected over Don
Peters, a veteran Teamster official in Chicago, to succeed Roy
Williams upon Williams' 10-year prison sentence on a conviction of
attempting to bribe a U.S. senator.
   Officially, the union is mum on the power struggle. Duke Zeller,
a spokesman for the union, said the only item on the agenda is
naming a new president and, possibly, a new secretary-treasurer.
   ``Historically, it goes pretty quickly,'' Zeller said. ``But
anything can happen.''
   The selection will occur just two weeks after the government
filed a suit seeking to place control of the entire union under a
court-appointed trustee, saying all of its top officials have
allowed the Teamsters to be controlled by leaders of organized
crime families.
   Among the allegations in the suit are that mob bosses in Chicago
and New York were the forces behind elevating Williams to the
union's presidency in 1981 and Presser to the post in 1983.
   A federal criminal court jury in May found that the government
lacked sufficient proof of that and attorneys for the union have
vehemently argued their is no organized crime influence at the top
of the union.
   At the time of his death, Presser was awaiting trial on federal
charges of labor racketeering and embezzlement in connection with
an alleged payroll-padding scheme at a Cleveland local that he also
headed. He had pleaded innocent to the charges.

   Leaders of five Warsaw Pact countries
arrived Thursday to join Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in a
two-day summit expected to focus on reductions in nuclear and
conventional weapons.
   The meeting Friday and Saturday was to be the first of the
political-consultative council of the Warsaw Treaty Organization
since the U.S.-Soviet summit that ended June 2 in Moscow.
   The session will be Gorbachev's first opportunity to brief his
fellow communist leaders on his meeting with President Reagan. The
superpower leaders exchanged ratified copies of a treaty to ban
short- and medium-range nuclear weapons, most of which are deployed
in Europe.
   Enactment of the accord focuses new attention on long-stalled
efforts to reduce conventional forces in Europe, and Gorbachev
indicated that would be a priority item on the agenda of the Warsaw
Pact meeting.
   Talks on conventional force levels are to resume in Vienna this
fall, and Gorbachev suggested upon his arrival in Poland on Monday
that informal talks be held to search for a new starting point that
could lead to progress.
   ``Poland and the U.S.S.R., as parties to the Warsaw Treaty,
attach special importance to the quickest possible inauguration of
negotiations on the reduction of armed forces and conventional
armaments in Europe,'' said a communique issued by the two
countries on Thursday as Gorbachev concluded a four-day tour of
Poland in advance of the summit.
   Both countries are ``resolutely in favor of removing
disproportions and asymmetries existing in this area (and) are
ready for a realistic and constructive dialogue on the subject,''
the communique added.
   The NATO countries contend that communist forces hold a
dangerous two-to-one advantage tanks and artillery deployed in the
border regions separating East and West Europe.
   In a speech to parliament Monday, the first day of his six-day
visit to Poland, Gorbachev proposed withdrawing an unspecified
number of ``analagous'' Warsaw Pact air forces if NATO agreed not
to deploy 72, U.S.-built, F-16 fighter-jets in Italy.
   Speculation that the Warsaw Pact may be preparing for a dramatic
force pullback was raised in Washington last week, when a U.S.
State Department official said intelligence reports indicated the
Soviet Union was preparing to remove some or all of its 65,000
troops in Hungary.
   Joining Gorbachev and Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski for
the Warsaw Pact meeting are leaders from the other five pact
nations.
   Romanian leader Nicholae Ceaucescu, Czechoslovak leader Milos
Jakes, Bulgarian leader Todor Zhivkov, East German leader Erich
Honecker and Hungarian leader Karoly Grosz all arrived in Warsaw
late Thursday.
   It was Warsaw's turn to host the annual session of the communist
defense alliance founded in this Polish capital in 1955.
   The pact has been showing a greater degree of diversity in
recent years, with members taking divergent courses in response to
Gorbachev's program of ``perestroika,'' or reform.
   The meeting of Eastern European chiefs comes barely two weeks
after the Soviet Union's 19th Communist Party conference, which
endorsed an extension of Gorbachev's political and economic reforms.
   Poland and Hungary tend to be the pact's most enthusiastic
backers of reform. Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria are taking a more a
cautious approach, while East Germany shows only grudging interest
in conducting similar reforms.
   Romania, where power is concentrated almost entirely in the
hands of Ceaucescu, is conspicuously out of step with the reform
trend and sharply critical of it.

<HEAD>Gore Pays Off Debt Without Dukakis' Help</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, whose
Democratic presidential campaign fell flat outside the South, has
raised enough money to pay off his more than $2 million campaign
debt, a spokesman said Thursday.
   Gore was celebrating the achievement _ done without help from
successful Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis' campaign _ at a
dinner with major fund raisers at the Tennessee governor's mansion
in Nashville Thursday evening.
   Mike Kopp, Gore's press secretary, said the defunct campaign
raised more than $1 million in contributions and is due to receive
the balance needed to retire the debt in federal campaign money
matching the contributions.
   Gore owed $1.5 million, based on his latest Federal Election
Commission report on June 20. But Kopp said the campaign calculated
the final amount owed would be $2.1 million.
   ``We have as of this evening cash on hand of a little over $1
million,'' Kopp said. ``A lot of that came in overnight express
packages this morning.''
   Kopp said between 170 and 200 Gore fund raisers, each of whom
raised anywhere from $5,000 to more than $40,000 against the debt,
were attending the dinner and private concert by Gore supporter and
country singer Johnny Cash and his band. Also providing
entertainment was singer Crystal Gayle.
   Gore withdrew from the presidential race following a poor third
place showing in the New York primary. He scored victories in his
native South on Super Tuesday but was unable to match them
elsewhere.

   Residents of this ski resort town
believe a Garbage Day celebration is a great way to have a day go
to waste.
   They dressed up like trash, brought along bags of trash and
smelled trash during the sixth annual celebration Wednesday.
   The event began when the western North Carolina town was
incorporated and needed a garbage truck. The first truck was
christened with a bottle of champagne.
   Since then the celebration has continued each year with picnics,
costumes and contests with other area sanitation departments.
   ``It's crazy and I do crazy things like this,'' said Blanche
Ross, a schoolteacher on vacation from Orlando, Fla., who was
dressed as a bag of trash.
   Ms. Ross won first place for being dressed as the most
interesting bag of trash.
   ``I've put a lot of reusable items in (the costume) _ things
like an old bra that can be used as a slingshot, a mouse trap,
toilet paper and old cartons and things like that,'' she said. ``I
was really raunchy.''
   ``It was great it rained,'' added Sheila Maddux, executive
director of the Beech Mountain Chamber of Commerce. ``It made
everything smell a lot better.''

   The state Motor Vehicles Division has
decided that no matter what the word ``petard'' means in French,
it's OK for Bill and Donna Brewster to use it on their Mercedes.
   Mrs. Brewster operates a business by the same name.
   Someone complained to the division that petard is a French
colloquialism meaning to break wind. The division ordered the
Brewsters to turn in their plate because it carried ``offensive and
vulgar connotations.''
   Brewster appealed.
   Armed with a pair of dictionaries, Brewster argued before a
state hearings officer April 14 that although the word may have
vulgar roots, petard today is neither vulgar nor offensive.
   ``We got a letter,'' Brewster said Tuesday. ``Seven pages of
gobbledygook, but we won.''
   The Webster's New World Dictionary College Edition defines
petard as an explosive device used in ancient times to force an
opening in a wall or gate, and a firecracker. However, the Latin
and French roots of the word do mean to break wind, the dictionary
adds.
   But the dictionary also notes the use in Shakespeare's Hamlet of
the phrase, ``hoist with one's own petard,'' meaning to be caught
in one's own trap.

   Polish intellectuals and scientists met
with Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Thursday and asked him for more
artistic freedom, scentific cooperation, and a renewed Marxist
dialogue with religion.
   The most moving part of the two-hour session with the Soviet
leader came when a Polish physicist said his father was executed in
the Stalinist purge of the Polish Communist Party in the 1930s.
   He thanked Gorbachev for a decision to erect a monument in
Moscow to victims of Stalinist repression.
   Among those attending the meeting in the newly renovated
ballroom of Warsaw's Royal Castle were historians, scientists, film
makers, philosophers, journalists, musicians and critics _ about
300 of Poland's intellectual elite.
   The meeting was broadcast live on national television.
   The group included a smattering of moderate supporters of the
Polish opposition movement. Participating were Marcin Krul,
publisher of Poland's only legal private magazine; and Andrzej
Stemalchowski, president of the Catholic Intellectuals Club of
Warsaw.
   Also attending were composer-conductor Krzysztof Penderecki,
film maker Krzysztof Zanussi, actor Daniel Olbrychski and
controversial Marxist philosopher-economist Adam Schaff.
   Historian Bogdan Sucholdowski, chairman of the national
Commission of Culture, presided over the session.
   Gorbachev first gave an off-the-cuff monologue on
``perestroika,'' his program of economic and social reforms which
he said is intended to improve the lives of everyday people.
   He spoke in Russian. Many Polish intellectuals speak Russian,
and some participants did not require earphones to listen to a
translation.
   Physicist Jan Rychlewski then took the floor. He suggested that
socialist countries each concentrate their research in a few
limited fields to avoid being left behind by the West.
   Speaking in emotional tones, Rychlewski then apologized for
bringing up a topic ``which I ought not mention.''
   ``In the name of my family, in the name of my community, I would
like to thank the 19th CPSU (Communist Party of the Soviet Union)
conference and the delegates to that conference here, for the
decision to erect in Moscow the monument to the victims of
repression,'' Rychlewski said. ``Among those victims was also my
father, a Polish patriot and a Polish communist.
   ``We don't know where his grave is. But now we will treat this
monument as his grave. We will have a place to lay flowers.''
   Polish television showed Gorbachev nodding acknowlegement.
   Film maker Zanussi started his remarks by praising the Polish
film tradition, including the dean of Polish moviemaking, Andrzej
Wajda, who lionized the now-banned Solidarity trade movement in his
film ``Man of Iron.'' Wajda apparently was not present at
Thursday's meeting.
   ``The chances to make films expressing reality can only occur
when there is creative freedom,'' said Zanussi. ``We have often not
had such conditions.''
   Wojciech Zukrowski, chairman of the official Polish Writers
Union, said publishing long-banned books would quickly fill in the
``blank spots'' in history that Polish and Soviet historians are
now re-evaluating.
   Philosopher Janusz Kuczynski suggested to Gorbachev that the
Marxist concept of religion as the ``opium of the masses'' should
be redefined and called for reopening the dialogue between Marxism
and Christianity. The Catholic Church continues to play a central
role in Polish society, despite the officially atheistic stance of
the ruling Communist Party.
   Stelmachowski, the Catholic club president, speaking from home
after the meeting, said he found the discussion interesting but
that Gorbachev's brief reply promising written responses in a
volume to be published later ``left a feeling of hunger.''
   He said he was vaguely reminded of the trip to Warsaw in the
19th century of Czar Alexander II. The czar promised reforms but in
the end repressed Polish aspirations after a popular revolt against
Russian rule in 1863.

<HEAD>CBS Poll Has Dukakis Drawing Even in Texas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael Dukakis pulled even with Vice
President George Bush in Texas after naming Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of
Texas as his Democratic running mate, CBS News reported Thursday
night.
   The poll of 580 registered voters on Tuesday and Wednesday found
48 percent supporting Dukakis to 44 percent for Bush. The margin of
error was plus or minus four percentage points, making the race a
dead heat.
   Polls that were taken before Dukakis selected Bentsen on Tuesday
have found a big Bush lead in Texas, but showed the lead narrowing
to a dead heat if Bentsen were chosen. The CBS poll confirmed that
outcome.
   In another poll Tuesday, Dukakis led Bush by 10 points
nationally, a margin roughly in line with other recent national
surveys. The new poll, by NBC News and The Wall Street Journal, was
done before Dukakis chose Bentsen.
   Dukakis' selection of Bentsen was seen as a home-state challenge
to Bush, who maintains an apartment in Houston. But the CBS Texas
poll found that 57 percent of respondents do not think of Bush as a
``real Texan.''
   Bush was rated favorably by 44 percent of Texas voters and
unfavorably by 33 percent. Dukakis had a lower favorable rating, 37
percent, but also a slightly lower unfavorable score, 28 percent.
   Bentsen did better than either, with a 55 percent favorable
rating and an unfavorable rating of only 15 percent. Moreover, 21
percent said having Bentsen on the ticket made them more likely to
vote for Dukakis.
   The Texans also said they favored Bentsen for re-election to the
Senate over Republican Rep. Beau Boulter, 64-20. But 61 percent
said Bentsen should withdraw from the Senate race now that he is to
run for vice president, even though Texas law allows him to seek
both seats.
   In the national poll by NBC and the Journal, Dukakis' 10-point
lead was 5 points lower than in an NBC-Journal poll a month ago.
The poll was conducted July 8-11 among 1,695 registered voters, and
had a three point error margin.

<HEAD>PTL Donations Down To $25,000 A Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PTL's bankruptcy trustee said Thursday
that more guests at the Heritage Grand Hotel and income from
Heritage USA's new water park are helping offset donations that
have plummeted to $25,000 a day.
   M.C. ``Red'' Benton said the water park and stepped-up business
at the hotel are bringing in about another $25,000 a day, but with
the dwindling donations, the PTL ministry is still falling short of
the $60,000 a day it needs to operate.
   The difference is coming from profits from the sale of PTL
property that was sold this spring, he said.
   Benton said another round of on-air appeals for donations will
begin soon to remind viewers of PTL's television viewers of the
need for money.
   The lowest donations have fallen is $22,000 a day, in late May,
Benton said. Increased on-the-air appeals got the donations
temporarily back up to about $100,000 a day, but they've steadily
declined ever since.
   Benton said efforts to find a buyer for Heritage USA continue.
The ministry is working with several interested buyers, including
Charlotte businessman George Shinn and ousted PTL founder Jim
Bakker, he said.
   Benton also has established a Friday deadline for a $50 million
deposit by Australian businessman Gavin Morehu, who has said he
plans to offer $200 million to buy Heritage USA.
   ``We're still waiting on somebody to come up with a deposit,''
he said Thursday.
   Benton said he asked Morehu to deposit the money in escrow as
evidence of ability to make good on the offer, and he probably
would grant an extension of two or three days if one is requested.
   Bruce French, director of sales and marketing at Heritage USA,
said the water park is averaging just below 1,000 people per day.
   ``We're particularly happy with the regional attendance,''
French said. ``In the past, we counted on our visitors to be the
bulk of our attendance. This year we've turned that around and
decided to market to the area.''

<HEAD>Members Of Congress Tell Shultz Iranian Oppostion Offers Best Hope</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some 153 members of Congress have written
Secretary of State George Shultz that the Iranian opposition rather
than U.S. intervention offers the best hope of overthrowing
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   ``It is not our role to go to war with Iran,'' said the letter
obtained Thursday by The Associated Press.
   ``We believe the ultimate solution to the Iranian problem must
come from within Iran itself,'' said the letter. ``The people of
the country must remove Khomeini and the mullahs and replace them
with a government that is more humane to its own citizens and less
belligerent toward other countries of the world.''
   The letter was dated June 20, nearly two weeks before the July 3
U.S. shoot-down of Iran Air flight 655 that killed all 290 people
aboard.
   The copy of the letter bore the signatures of Sen. Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz., and Reps. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., Helen Delich
Bentley, R-Md., and Mervyn M. Dymally, D-Calif.
   A statement from Dymally's office said Thursday that in the end,
14 senators and 139 representatives signed the letter.
   The statement said the Reagan administration had been trying to
establish a relationship with ``moderate elements'' of the Khomeini
regime, but that the letter was meant to stress that ``a long-term
solution to the problems in the (Persian) Gulf is more likely to
come from popular opposition to government policies within Iran
than through outside efforts to stimulate change.''
   The letter said the Iranian resistance had ``told us that
anti-Khomeini protests have recently occurred within Iran'' and
noted that Iran had suffered reverses in fighting with Iraq and
with the Iraq-based National Liberation Army of the People's
Mujahedeen of Iran.
   ``The measured, yet decisive response shown by the
administration to Iran's minings against our ships demonstrates our
resolve to protect our interests without full-scale war,'' it said.
   The members also commended the administration for pressing its
efforts for a U.N.-sponsored arms and oil embargo to pressure Iran
to end the war.
   The statement from Dymally's office said those signing the
letter included Sens. David Karnes, R-Neb., and Paul Simon, D-Ill.,
as well as Reps. Edward Feighan, D-Ohio; Donald Lukens, R-Ohio;
Peter Kostmayer, D-Pa.; Robert Lagomarsino, R-Calif.; and
Christopher Smith, R-N.J.
   A Dymally spokesman, who asked not to be identified, said the
statement included only those names because those members had
approved the statement. He said he had been unable to check the
statement with the other signers of the letter before releasing it
and therefore did not release their names.

   Thousands of Armenians stayed away from work
Thursday to press for transfer to Armenia of a region in
neighboring Azerbaijan and 150,000 held a rally for the cause,
activists in the southern republic said.
   ``The people are still not prepared to work,'' said a Communist
Party worker in the disputed southern territory of
Nagorno-Karabakh, which has been disrupted by strikes by ethnic
Armenians for two months. Strikes in Armenia itself began July 4.
   Three-quarters of the territory's 160,000 residents are ethnic
Armenians, but the region, roughly the size of Delaware, was
assigned to Azerbaijan in 1923.
   Police in Moscow arrested 15 protesters who unfurled the Latvian
flag and several protest banners near the Kremlin. They were
demonstrating on behalf of Baltic nationalities and Ukrainians as
well as Armenians.
   In Yerevan, the Armenian capital, 150,000 people gathered
Thursday night outside a historical institute, Gagik Aghasarian, an
Armenian architect who attended the rally, said in a telephone
interview.
   They called on the republic's 10 deputies to the nation's
central parliament to press for annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh, he
said.
   Armenians believe the Presidium, or executive committee, of the
Supreme Soviet, the highest legislative body in the Soviet
government, will meet Monday to consider the Nagorno-Karabakh
question.
   In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim P. Perfilyev said
such a meeting was likely but that he didn't know when it would
occur.
   The names and workplaces of the 10 Armenian deputies were read
out at the Yerevan rally so members of the crowd could contact them
and ``express the wish of the people that Karabakh is annexed to
Armenia,'' Aghasarian said.
   Police in Moscow arrested 15 protesters who unfurled the Latvian
flag and several protest banners near the Kremlin. They were
demonstrating on behalf of Baltic nationalities and Ukrainians as
well as Armenians.
   The party worker in Nogorno-Karabakh said in a telephone
interview that paramilitary police were deployed in rural areas.
Perfilyev told reporters the situation was tense in the region.
   A resident of Stepanakert, the territorial capital, said people
were suffering because of the job actions resulting from months of
ethnic turmoil over the region's fate.
   ``Our situation is very bad because the strike is continuing. No
one is working,'' said the resident, a woman who hung up the phone
before giving her name.
   She said Nagorno-Karabakh residents had to rely on food produced
locally. ``We aren't receiving food from Azerbaijan or Armenia,''
she said, but ``we get some potatoes from the Stepanakert area.''
   Rem Ananikyan, deputy chief of Armenia's official news agency
Armenpress, said by telephone from Yerevan that more than 200,000
people attended a rally Wednesday night.
   Armenians have defied Azerbaijan and central authorities all the
way up to Mikhail S. Gorbachev with a 5-month-old campaign to annex
Nagorno-Karabakh. Despite its preponderance of Armenians, most of
whom are Christians, the region was given to predominantly Moslem
Azerbaijan 65 years ago.
   Khovik Vasilyan, an Armenian activist and former political
prisoner, said Armenians learned from television late Wednesday
that Azerbaijan's government had quashed the previous day's
decision by Nagorno-Karabakh's legislature to secede from
Azerbaijan and join Armenia. He is foreman in a state company that
makes farm buildings.
   The Presidium of Azerbaijan's parliament declared Tuesday night,
a few hours after the legislators acted, that the secession was
illegal.
   Ananikyan, the news agency executive, said the Yerevan
demonstrators ``demanded that this decision be resolved, that the
strike be continued.''
   Strikes in Armenia began July 4. Ananikyan said public
transportation was running normally Thursday in Yerevan, a city of
1.1 million people, but strikes continued in many factories.
   Vasilyan said from Yerevan, also by telephone: ``Basically, the
entire republic is not working.''
   Pravda, the national Communist Party daily, said Thursday the
work stoppage in Armenia has caused the equivalent of $65 million
in lost production and that construction worth $29 million had not
been completed.
   Ananikyan said speakers at Wednesday's rally called for the
strike to continue until Monday.
   The party worker in Stepanakert, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the paramilitary police ``are helping us normalize
the situation, but it's calm here.''
   Moscow radio said police were investigating Nagorno-Karabakh
residents who had manufactured or acquired weapons, but did not say
what the arms were for. Perfilyev said the confiscations were a
precautionary move.
   Thirty-two people were killed in ethnic riots in February at
Sumgait, Azerbaijan _ 26 of them Armenians.
   The demonstrators in Moscow released a statement urging
authorities to resolve the dispute.
   Dissident journalist Sergei I. Grigoryants was among those
arrested Thursday. Others included representatives of informal
political groups from Estonia and Lithuania, and Ukrainian human
rights activists.
   They were taken to a police post, held for five hours and freed,
dissident Alexei Manamnikov said by telephone. He said Grigoryants
and three others were ordered to appear in court next week, but the
charges were not known.

<HEAD>Democrats Seek to Patch Dukakis-Jackson Rift as Convention Nears</HEAD>

   Jesse Jackson asked former President Carter on Thursday to play
peacemaker in his pre-convention dispute with Michael Dukakis,
saying, ``I simply want respect and responsibility'' after the long
run for the Democratic presidential nomination.
   Dukakis, six days away from officially becoming his party's
nominee, said that despite the tension, he expects Jackson to join
him and running mate Lloyd Bentsen in a convention display of unity.
   Vice President George Bush needled Dukakis from afar, saying he
thought the governor could have shown ``a little more sensitivity''
toward his rival in the manner in which he announced his choice of
Bentsen. Bush also went to the United Nations where he made a
high-visibility defense of U.S. actions in shooting down an Iranian
airliner.
   While there is plenty of time to settle matters before the
convention opens next Monday, Jackson's complaints could wind up
threatening efforts by Dukakis and Democratic Party leaders to
stage a unified, harmonious party meeting.
   Dukakis told CBS News in an interview he tried but failed to
reach Jackson by phone on Tuesday to tell him of Bentsen's
selection. He said Jackson should take no offense from their
failure to make a connection.
   ``Obviously in a contest like this somebody wins and somebody
loses and I'm the guy who's won and it's my job to go out and pick
a running mate,'' said Dukakis.
   Asked if the convention audience would witness a final display
of Dukakis-Bentsen-Jackson unity, he said, ``I expect that you
will.''
   Jackson did not specify any issues he wanted Carter to mediate.
He said he was not seeking ``a personal apology'' for Dukakis'
failure to notify him before word got out that Bentsen had been
picked for the vice presidential slot on the ticket.
   In Chicago, at a news conference before boarding a bus caravan
for the convention, Jackson said he would ``exercise all of our
rights'' at the four-day meeting, and added it's an ``open
question'' whether he will challenge Bentsen's nomination in
Atlanta.
   Dukakis, his nomination assured, spent the day working on state
budget problems and burnishing his credentials as a governor who
cracks down on drugs. The Massachusetts governor visited two state
troopers shot during an undercover drug operation and signed a
state law requiring tougher sentences for cocaine dealers.
   ``We're serious about a war on drugs in this state,'' he said.
   Bentsen spent the day in the Senate. He told reporters that
easing the tension with Jackson was ``Governor Dukakis'
responsibility. ... I know he has a high regard for Rev. Jackson. I
assume he'll have a meeting with Jackson.''
   Meanwhile, CBS said a new survey in Texas indicates that Dukakis
has pulled even with Bush since naming Bentsen as his running mate,
a marked improvement in his standing. A poll of 580 registered
voters on Tuesday and Wednesday found 48 percent supporting Dukakis
to 44 percent for Bush. The margin of error was plus or minus four
percentage points, making the race a dead heat.
   Bert Lance, who has advised Jackson during the presidential
campaign, said he believed Dukakis' rival would eventually support
the party's ticket. ``It's in the best interest of Jesse Jackson,
in my opinion, to see a Democrat elected in November,'' said Lance,
who once served as Carter's federal budget director.
   Carter declined comment on Jackson's statements, and Dukakis'
aides sought to minimize the dispute.
   Democratic Party officials held a symbolic ribbon-cutting
ceremony to mark the transformation of the Omni hall into a
convention city, complete with a huge movable podium in pastel
shades _ designed to be more pleasing to the eye than the
traditional red, white and blue.
   But if the hammering and sawing was nearly finished, the
political maneuvering was in full swing.
   Black members of Congress predicted boisterous protests at the
convention over what they see as a snub to Jackson.
   But some of the lawmakers also said they would try to hold a
meeting with Dukakis aides or perhaps the governor himself next
week in an effort to repair the breach.
   ``Clearly the way Jesse Jackson was dealt with, on a personal
basis, looms as a monumental issue,'' said Rep. Ron Dellums,
D-Calif.
   Jackson's call on Carter _ a Georgian who has remained generally
out of the spotlight since his defeat in 1980 _ came as party
chairman Paul Kirk and other Democratic leaders appealed for unity
to prevent the convention from deteriorating into a prime-time tug
of war.
   Officials spread the word that Dukakis had called Jackson on
Wednesday, and a Jackson aide termed the call ``a good start'' at
repairing relations.
   Both Kirk and House Speaker Jim Wright, convention chairman,
urged unity on the bickering sides. Wright predicted a harmonious
convention that will unite all factions and ``demonstrate that our
party is ready to govern.''
   For the moment, at least, there seemed little harmony.
   The most recent round of acrimony began when Jackson _ who
wanted the second spot on the ticket for himself _ learned of
Bentsen's selection from a reporter on Tuesday morning.
   Jackson told reporters in Chicago that Dukakis aide Paul
Brountas apologized for the way the notification was handled.
   He said he had talked to Carter and ``he wants to serve in any
way he can.''
   But he said, ``I do not seek a personal apology. The progressive
wing of the Democratic party seeks inclusion.''
   ``The issue of my constituency is not about the timing of a
call,'' he said. ``We want inclusion in the party at every level.''
   Dukakis spokesman Mark Gearan said of Wednesday's
Dukakis-Jackson phone call, ``The governor obviously made it clear
that it was his own intention for the Rev. Jackson and all of the
candidates to hear the news from no one else but the governor.''
Gearan characterized the conversation as friendly, but declined to
say whether the governor had apologized.
   Jackson spokesman Ron Brown termed Dukakis' gesture an
``important call and a good start'' toward healing relations, but
made it clear he expects there will be numerous conversations
between the two men in the days ahead.
   Bentsen went about his Senate rounds as usual, although the
jockeying already was beginning among Texas politicians eager to
replace him in Congress if he wins the vice presidency.
   Bush traveled to the United Nations to represent the United
States at a Security Council debate over the Navy's downing of a
civilian Iranian airliner in the Persian Gulf. He called the
incident a ``terrible human tragedy,'' but defended the actions of
the Navy commander who gave the order to fire, and said Iran shares
responsibility in the 290 deaths for sending its plane into a
battle region.
   Jackson has ordered aides to break off negotiations with Dukakis
forces over the party platform. Kirk, in Atlanta, said those talks
had not yet resumed, although he said aides to the two men had
spoken.

   Gov. Michael Dukakis, saying Thursday that his
state is ``serious about a war on drugs,'' visited two state
troopers shot during an undercover drug operation and signed
tougher sentencing standards for cocaine dealers.
   Dukakis, only days away from accepting the Democratic
presidential nomination, spent most of Thursday working on state
budget problems while aides tried to ease the continuing tension
between their camp and Jesse Jackson.
   Spokesman Mark Gearan said a face-to-face meeting between
Dukakis and Jackson likely would be arranged after both arrive
Sunday in Atlanta for the Democratic National Convention. But he
said no such talk had been scheduled.
   Dukakis, in a broadcast interview, defended his choice of Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen of Texas as a running mate, despite Jackson's
interest in the job.
   ``Obviously in a contest like this somebody wins and somebody
loses and I'm the guy who's won and it's my job to go out and pick
a running mate,'' he said in an interview with CBS.
   However, asked if the convention audience would witness a final
display of Dukakis-Bentsen-Jackson unity, he said, ``I expect that
you will.''
   In Chicago, meanwhile, Jackson called on former President Carter
to play the role of peacemaker in his pre-convention dispute with
Dukakis. He did not say what specific issues he wanted Carter to
negotiate with Dukakis but said he was looking for ``meetings of
substance ... about the fundamental issues.''
   Spokesman Gearan said Dukakis spoke Wednesday afternoon with
Jackson, who has been described by aides as ``flabbergasted'' that
Dukakis did not inform him of the selection of Bentsen as his
running mate until after word of the choice had been reported in
the news media.
   ``It was a good, friendly conversation,'' Gearan said.
   Later, he declined to answer directly when asked if the Dukakis
campaign felt it necessary to bring in Carter or any other mediator.
   ``Our campaigns have been talking throughout this process and we
are confident they will continue to talk and that we are going to
have a unified convention,'' Gearan said.
   The Dukakis campaign has said Dukakis tried to personally inform
all of the other candidates for the vice presidential nomination
about the selection of Bentsen early Tuesday morning but was unable
to reach Jackson and Ohio Sen. John Glenn before the selection was
reported.
   Dukakis declined to answer reporters' questions outside the two
hospitals where he visited the troopers who are recovering from
gunshot wounds suffered Wednesday night.
   Aides said he had already been scheduled to sign the
drug-sentencing bills Thursday and decided to do so at Boston City
Hospital after learning of the shootings.
   ``We're serious about a war on drugs in this state,'' the
governor said before he signed the bills on the hood of a state
police cruiser. ``We're working at it.''
   The measures lower from 28 grams to 14 grams the amount of
cocaine possession needed to trigger a mandatory minimum three-year
sentence, increase the minimum sentence for possession of 28 grams
or more to five years and set a minimum 10-year sentence for
possession of 100 or more grams of cocaine.
   The laws also increase penalties for first offenders convicted
of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute and for those
convicted of selling the drug to minors.
   Back at the Statehouse, Dukakis met with staff and legislators
as he looked to trim as much as $200 million in spending before
signing the state's fiscal 1989 budget. He also was awaiting
legislative approval of a plan to balance the fiscal 1988 budget,
which is $370 million in the red pending approval of the plan.
Aides said Dukakis hoped to sign both spending plans on Saturday, a
day before he heads to the convention.

<HEAD>Palestinian's Conviction Opens Way For U.S. Extradition Request</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Palestinian believed linked to a deadly
attack on a Greek cruise ship was convicted on false passport
charges Thursday, clearing the way for a U.S. extradition request
to be heard.
   Greek authorities have said the submachine gun and hand grenade
raid on the City of Poros cruise ship, which killed nine people and
injured 98 last Monday, may have been aimed at hijacking the vessel
in an effort to gain Mohammed Rashid's release from prison.
   Rashid, 34, a self-proclaimed ``fighter'' for the Palestine
Liberation Organization, is wanted by the United States for murder,
accused of planting a bomb aboard a Pan Am jumbo jet in 1982 that
killed a Japanese teen-ager and injured 15 people.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said in Washington
on Thursday, ``We strongly believe that the most effective way to
fight terrorism in this case is to expeditiously begin extradition
proceedings against Rashid.''
   In new developments Thursday in the ship attack:
   _A 21-year-old Frenchwoman sought by Greek authorities in
connection with the attack, Isabelle Bismuth, was identified
through dental records as being among the nine people killed,
according to informed sources in Paris, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Her mother told the French press earlier her daughter was a
secretary on vacation in Greece and not a terrorist. A man shown in
a picture playing cards with Ms. Bismuth on the ship is one of
three men sought as attack suspects.
   _A Danish couple who were aboard the ship two days before it was
attacked claim to have met one of the suspected terrorists then,
the Danish newspaper B.T. reported in its Friday edition.
   The report indicated the terrorists scouted the liner on an
earlier cruise before striking. The Danish couple spoke on
condition of anonymity. The Danish man, who knows some Arabic, said
21-year-old Mohammed Zozad and two Arabic-speaking friends of
Zozad's stood out among the nearly 500 passengers, who were mainly
tourists from Northern Europe.
   In the case of Rashid, Greece says it is considering the U.S.
extradition request but that Rashid would have to serve his Greek
sentence before he could be sent to the United States.
   He began serving a seven-month jail sentence after a three-judge
panel found him guilty of entering Greece on a forged Syrian
passport on May 26.
   He appealed the sentence but presiding Judge Mihalis Margaritis
ordered his continued detention at Korydallos prison, in nearby
Piraeus.
   Now that Rashid has been tried on the Greek charge, proceedings
can begin on the U.S. extradition request. He cannot be extradited
before serving his full prison term.
   ``They are trying to involve my client in these crimes. He has
no relation to these violent crimes the Americans are accusing him
of, especially the recent one,'' Rashid's lawyer, Spyros Fitrakis,
told the court.
   ``As far as the ship attack is concerned the Americans are
trying to convince people the Palestinians did so that I would be
released. This is not true,'' Rashid testified.
   He said his forged passport was given to him by ``my PLO
superiors.''
   ``I am a soldier in the Palestine Liberation Army and a member
of the PLO,'' Rashid said.
   He was arrested by police at Athens airport May 30 on a tip-off
from the U.S. Embassy.
   ``I was passing through Greece on a secret mission,'' Rashid
told the court. He would not say where he was headed.
   The sweltering courtroom was packed with reporters and police.
Dozens of police officers cradling automatic weapons checked people
entering the courtroom.
   Police officer Matthaios Gonias testified that Rashid was
identified by his fingerprints and that the defendant had served
three years of a six-year sentence imposed in 1973 for smuggling
just under 40 pounds of hashish into Greece.
   In Baghdad, Iraq, on Wednesday, a spokesman for PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat said the group condemned the ship attack.
   On Wednesday also, in Beirut, Lebanon, a group calling itself
The Organization of the Martyrs of the Popular Revolution of
Palestine claimed responsibility for the attack. There was no way
to independently authenticate the claim by this previously unknown
group.

   A homeless advocate scaled a 767-foot
broadcast tower Thursday and vowed to remain there until the
federal government expands housing opportunities for low-income
Americans.
   Wayne Vorhees, a volunteer with the Community for Creative
Non-Violence, climbed the tower in northwest Washington and, after
waiting for winds to subside, unfurled a 50-foot banner reading
``Housing Now.''
   Two of his companions were arrested.
   John Muirhead, 24, of Clinton, N.Y., was apprehended after
abandoning his attempt to join Vorhees at the top of the tower,
which is owned by television station WFTY and used by that station,
city police and various radio stations.
   A second man, Harold Moss, was arrested after police saw him
speaking by walkie-talkie with Vorhees after Vorhees scaled the
steel communications tower.
   District of Columbia police inspector Ed Spurlock said both men
have been charged with unlawful entry. The misdemeanor charge
carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a $400 fine.
   The ages and hometowns for Vorhees and Moss were not immediately
available.
   Earlier in the day, CCNV leader Mitch Snyder and 36 of his
followers were arrested when they blocked traffic near the Capitol
to draw attention to the plight of the homeless. During that
protest, a ``Housing Now'' banner was draped outside the Longworth
House Office Building. All were charged with obstructing and
impeding passage on government grounds, police said.
   The dramatic tower climb was staged in an effort to focus
attention on America's current housing shortage, Moss said. ``Right
now, there's a frightening painful shortage of affordable housing,
not just in Washington, D.C. but all across America,'' Moss said
shortly before his arrest.
   ``It's not a matter of who's in the White House,'' Moss said.
``Homelessness is caused more and more by a lack of housing.''
   Moss said Vorhees has enough supplies to stay on the tower for
up to five days. Police said they're considering ways to get the
protester down, but did not reveal details.
   As Vorhees rested on a platform atop the tower, a police
helicopter circled nearby.
   Figures compiled by the Congressional Budget Office indicate
that the Department of Housing of Urban Development budget _ the
main source of federal housing assistance _ has been slashed 82
percent during the Reagan administration.
   Rental prices also are being driven up because many federally
subsidized low-income units have been demolished or abandoned in
the last eight years, with housing vouchers replacing maintenance
of these structures.
   A recent Harvard University study indicates that there are now
about 1 million more poor households than there are available
low-income housing units.

<HEAD>Sailor Sentenced To Life In Payroll Officer's Killing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAYPORT NAVAL STATION, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sailor convicted of
murdering and robbing the paymaster of the USS John Hancock was
sentenced to life in prison Thursday, naval officials said.
   Petty Officer 1st Class Ruben Colon was also given a
dishonorable discharge, broken to the lowest pay grade and forced
to forfeit all pay and allowances, said Lt. Cmdr. Tim Taylor.
   Colon, 34, was convicted Wednesday of murder, robbery and
kidnapping in the killing of Lt. j.g. Ratish Prasad and the theft
of $94,000 from the ship's safe while it lay at anchor at the
Mayport Naval Station.
   The sailor, now in the brig of the Jacksonville Naval Air
Station, could have faced the death penalty for murder, but under
his life sentence would be eligible for parole consideration in 10
years, said Taylor.
   ``He will stay in the Navy system, in one brig or another,
during the appeal process,'' said Taylor. If the sentence holds up
after the appeals, Colon will be transferred to the federal prison
system.
   Colon was charged with murdering Prasad on March 15 and taking
more than $94,000, more than 2,500 blank U.S. Treasury checks and a
payroll check for $419 made out to a Hancock crew member.
   He was arrested April 12 after investigators found more than
$87,000 and the blank federal checks in a safe-deposit box rented
in his name.
   He did not testify at his four-day court-martial, but at the
hearing, Colon proclaimed his innocence and urged the five members
of the court _ the equivalent of a jury at a civilian trial _ to
reconsider their decision to convict him.
   ``There was no one more surprised at your findings than
myself,'' he said, reading from a statement. He argued that the
contents of the safe-deposit box should not be enough evidence to
convict him.
   ``My life and death is in your hands,'' he said. ``You have all
the time in the world to decide.''
   After he made his statement, the panel recessed to take a
written ballot to determine whether to reopen deliberations on any
of the charges. Following the brief recess, the panel members
returned and announced the same verdict.

<HEAD>Tunnermann Blasts US, Wins Little Sympathy from OAS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nicaraguan Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann, faced
with a U.S. order to leave the country, accused the Reagan
administration Thursday of violating the Organization of American
States charter but he won little more than a polite hearing from
his OAS colleagues.
   Tunnermann left unclear whether he will abide by the expulsion
order, saying he will make his position clear at noon Friday, a few
hours before the deadline for his departure from U.S. territory.
   After a meeting of the OAS permanent council that lasted just
under two hours, the only expression of support Tunnermann could
claim was a statement by Mexican Ambassador Antonio de Icaza.
   Icaza, who spoke in the name of seven other governments, noted
that OAS provisions ensure that the 32 member states have the right
to attend meetings of the organization, ``independent of their
bilateral relations with the host government, underscoring the
right of all to full representation in the organization.''
   But Icaza also said that these rights are inadeqautely protected
under a 1975 agreement governing U.S. obligations as the host
country for the OAS. ``As a consequence,'' he said, ``it is
necessary to fill this legal vacuum.''
   The majority of the delegates sat impassively through the
session, apparently preferring to stay aloof from the latest
chapter in the seven-year history of acrimony between the United
States and Nicaragua.
   Much of the meeting was taken up by a heated exchange between
the U.S. and Nicaraguan delegates, with each accusing the other of
prolonging the conflict in Nicaragua.
   Tunnermann stopped short of asking for a formal endorsement of
his position, pointing out that he had requested the Thursday
meeting only to inform fellow delegates of his position.
   The Reagan administration on Tuesday ordered Tunnermann and
seven colleagues to leave the country within 72 hours, a day after
Nicaragua expelled eight American diplomats from Managua, including
U.S. Ambassador Richard Melton.
   The administration said the action was taken for retaliatory
purposes and, in the case of Tunnermann and military attache Major
Pedro Sampson, for violations of their privileges of residence in
the United States.
   The U.S. ambassador to the OAS, Richard MacCormack, told the
delegates that Tunnermann and Sampson had engaged in ``certain
activities'' which the United States found objectionable but he
declined to spell them out.
   He said the administration had deferred expelling Tunnermann and
Sampson earlier ``in order to avoid giving the Nicaragua government
a pretext for taking the kinds of actions it perpetrated this
week.''
   He added that the explusion of the American diplomats from
Managua ``removed the basis for such restraint on the part of the
United States.''
   The Reagan administration has said it expects Tunnermann and his
colleagues to comply with the expulsion order but the envoy was
non-committal when asked by reporters about his plans.
   President Reagan said Tunnermann will have a ``big surprise''
awaiting him if the envoy decides to ignore the U.S. demand.
   Tunnermann, who serves as both ambassador to the United States
and the OAS, said his government has considered taking his case
against the administration to U.S. courts.
   His main defense was that the United States has no right to
refuse accreditation to envoys sent to Washington by OAS member
states.
   ``It is a sovereign decision of our states, that the host
country must respect, to designate its representation before the
permanent council,'' he said.

   Hot, humid conditions dominated from the Plains east to the
Atlantic Coast on Thursday, while showers and thunderstorms were
scattered from the northeast parts of the Great Lakes into the
middle Mississippi Valley.
   Chicago's temperature reached 99 degrees Thursday afternoon,
tying the record high for the date in 1976, and temperatures were
in the 80s or 90s across much of the nation. In the desert
Southwest and the high Plains of Kansas, temperatures reached about
100 degrees.
   The strongest thunderstorms developed in northern and western
New York state and across much of New England, where cooler air
from the north clashed with the warm, humid air mass over the upper
Ohio Valley.
   Thunderstorms blew down trees and power lines at Amsterdam,
N.Y., Thursday afternoon causing power outages, and strong winds
accompanying thurderstorms uprooted trees, overturned a trailer and
downed power lines at Syracuse, N.Y.
   A severe thunderstorm watch was posted for parts of New York
state, Pennsylvania, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts,
Connecticut and Rhode Island.
   Showers were scattered from southern Iowa through central
Illinois into central Indiana. Rainfall amounts ranged from a
quarter-inch to three-quarters of an inch across the region.
   Thunderstorms were widespread across the southeastern United
States, but were spotty from north-central Colorado into the
Nebraska Panhandle and across central New Mexico.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55
degrees at Mullan, Idaho, to 106 degrees at Gila Bend, Ariz. The
low in the nation Thursday morning was 35 degrees at Truckee, Calif.
   Friday's forecast called for continued heat and humidity in the
southern, central and eastern parts of the nation. Showers and
thunderstorms were expected across the upper Great Lakes region as
well as southern Georgia and Florida.
   High temperatures in the 90s were forecast across much of the
nation, and in the 70s and 80s along the California coast and from
the northwest Great Lakes region into the upper Ohio Valley through
New England.
   Highs should reach 100 to 105 degrees across the central Plains
into north-central Texas, and across the Rio Grande Valley.
Temperatures were expected to soar to 105 to 115 degrees in the
desert southwest.

<HEAD>20-Year Prison Term In Kidnap-Murder Of Dutch Retail Tycoon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND DE LIGNY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HAARLEM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Dutch court Thursday sentenced an
unemployed management consultant to 20 years in prison and
indefinite psychiatric treatment for the kidnap-murder of a Dutch
grocery tycoon.
   Ferdi Elsas, 45, was found guilty of kidnapping Gerrit Jan
Heijn, vice-president of the multimillion-dollar Ahold retail
concern, shooting him in the head and throwing his body into a
forest grave the same day, last Sept. 9. The court also found Elsas
guilty of extortion.
   It was not immediately disclosed whether Elsas would appeal the
verdict.
   Ahold, with more than 600 stores the biggest supermarket chain
in the Netherlands, also owns the Giant Food and Bi-Lo supermarkets
in the United States.
   Heijn's family paid about $4 million in cash and diamonds for
his release. Most of the ransom was recovered after Elsas' arrest
April 6.
   ``You have without any compassion killed your victim ... who has
never done you any harm,'' Court President C. Terwee told Elsas in
the packed courtroom in this city 14 miles west of Amsterdam.
   A forensic psychiatrist told the court at the trial that Elsas
was bearing only limited responsibility for his deeds at the time
of the kidnapping.
   Noting, however, that the psychiatrist warned that Elsas ``might
again mount such a reckless operation in the future,'' the court
also confined Elsas indefinitely to an institution for the
criminally insane.
   Heijn, who was 56 at the time of his abduction, was seized at
gunpoint outside his home in one of Haarlem's affluent suburbs.
   When Heijn's relatives demanded a sign of life from the kidnap
victim last October, Elsas mailed them Heijn's little finger. Elsas
had severed it immediately after the killing and kept it in a
refrigerator at his home in a small village a few miles north of
Amsterdam, he testified.
   During his trial, Elsas claimed that the motive for the
abduction, which he said he had planned as a ``military
operation,'' had been to ease his financial problems.
   Elsas' arrest came after the discovery in January of a
250-guilder note from the ransom, which surfaced in an Amsterdam
supermarket close to his house.
   After a months-long police stake-out of the supermarket, Elsas
spent another 250-guilder note there, and was taken into custody
shortly after. Elsas' wife and two teenage children, who were taken
into custody at the time, were later released without charge.

   A Lebanese gunman inside the Libyan
Embassy held off police for nearly 12 hours Thursday before he fell
asleep and authorities rushed him, officials said. No shots were
fired and no one was injured.
   Police identified the arrested man as El-Ibrahim Edelbi, 22. He
had pulled out a revolver Thursday morning after embassy personnel
refused to grant him a visa to travel to Libya, authorities said.
   Edelbi escaped from a prison in Goettingen on July 8 with a
Turkish inmate who has since been recaptured, authorities said.
Edelbi was serving a three-year prison term for assault and had
been at the prison for 18 months.
   Police said Edelbi told officers he had eaten nothing since he
escaped.
   ``He had become very weak since his escape and looked exhausted
during the negotiations (with authorities),'' said Ulrich Fischer,
head of the Bonn police team that captured Edelbi.
   Fischer's team watched Edelbi through a video camera that is a
normal part of security on the first floor of the Libyan Embassy.
   At about 9:15 p.m. (3:15 p.m. EDT), police noticed Edelbi had
fallen asleep inside the first-floor visitors' room, and they
rushed into the building, Fischer said.
   ``Finally, he just fell asleep from exhaustion,'' said Fischer.
``He did not offer us any resistance.''
   Police said there were no injuries among several embassy workers
who had been trapped on upper floors since the siege began early
Thursday and that no shots were fired.
   Police said they did not know where Edelbi obtained his gun.
   Edelbi was taken to a local hospital for examination, officials
said.
   Police, alerted to the situation at 10 a.m. (4 a.m. EDT),
negotiated with him by telephone and through a metal-bar door at
the building's entrance.
   ``He demanded that he not be returned to prison. He said he
wanted to go to Libya because the Libyans always help the
Lebanese,'' said Fischer.
   In the face-to-face negotiations, the gunman kept himself at a
distance of about three yards to avoid being grabbed by police
officers on the other side of the metal gate, police spokesman Hans
Georg Classen said.
   Classen said Bonn police did not know how long Edelbi had lived
in West Germany, whether he had relatives in this country, or any
other details about him other than his prison record.
   Classen said a number of embassy employees had been on floors
above the gunman, who was alone on the ground floor of the
five-story building. But he did not know how many workers had been
in the building.
   They could not leave because the gunman controlled access to
stairways and doors.
   Shortly after the standoff began, heavily armed police officers
wearing combat gear climbed through a second-story window into the
embassy, known as the Libyan People's Bureau.
   Omar K. Bukhries, head of the embassy, had given police
permission to enter the building, Classen said. He said Bukhries
was able to escape through a side door shortly after the standoff
began.
   Other police armed with automatic rifles and wearing bulletproof
vests surrounded the building.
   The embassy is on a quiet, tree-lined street in Bad Godesberg,
an area of Bonn where many embassies are located.

   Jesse Jackson accepted an apology Thursday from a
Michael Dukakis aide over the handling of the No. 2 spot on the
Democratic ticket and asked former President Carter to mediate
tensions between the two camps.
   Jackson sounded a conciliatory note after the call from Paul
Brountas, Dukakis' campaign chairman, who offered an apology and
detailed a series of mistakes that led to a delay in Jackson's
being told that Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen had been selected Dukakis'
running mate.
   ``We accept that explanation,'' Jackson said at a news
conference before leaving on a three-day bus caravan to the
national convention in Atlanta.
   Asked about Carter's response to his request, Jackson said, ``He
wants to serve in any way he can.''
   Dukakis' campaign manager Susan Estrich said she knew nothing
about the proposal. Later, campaign spokesman Mark Gearan, asked
whether the Dukakis forces believed a mediator was needed, said,
``Our campaigns have been talking throughout this process and we
are confident they will continue to talk and that we are going to
have a unified convention.''
   Dukakis himself did not apologize during a telephone call
Wednesday, but Jackson said he did not ask for, and would not seek,
a ``personal apology.''
   Jackson learned of Dukakis' selection of Bentsen from reporters
as he arrived in Washington Tuesday morning. He received a call
from Dukakis about an hour later and before the public announcement
that afternoon.
   Dukakis said Wednesday he tried unsuccessfully to reach Jackson
but word got out.
   Dukakis' plans for a show of unity have been clouded by
Jackson's hints that he might challenge the selection of the Texas
senator. Jackson supporters have threatened protests, and some
Dukakis backers also criticized the treatment of Jackson by the
Dukakis camp.
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., a prominent Dukakis supporter once
viewed as a possible running mate to the Massachusetts governor,
said Dukakis blundered in not notifying Jackson earlier that he
wouldn't be on the ticket.
   And New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, a prominent Democrat, said
``Dukakis is not required to anything for Jesse'' but added: ``I
think if he wants to win, he should.''
   At the news conference, Jackson insisted ``we will exercise all
our rights'' during the convention next week and said it's still an
``open question'' whether he will allow his name to be entered in
nomination for vice president.
   ``It is an open convention, we have not yet made a decision
about all the strategies we will employ,'' he said.
   Despite those statements, Jackson sent generally conciliatory
signals to the Dukakis camp, saying ``the issue for my constituency
is not about the time of a call.''
   ``I simply want the respect and responsibility,'' said Jackson,
who emphasized that he wants ``meetings of substance between now
and then about the fundamental issues.''
   Later, after his bus caravan arrived in Indianapolis, Jackson
said ``we're not going to give up on communications'' with the
Dukakis camp. He said he expected the two would meet ``at some
appropriate time.''
   ``We hope in the next three or four days that matters will be
resolved,'' he said at his news conference in Indianapolis.
   Earlier, Jackson said he has not set all of his strategies for
next week, but wants Carter to play ``a real role'' in mediating
between the two camps. He telephoned the former president Thursday
to ask his help.
   ``He understands the equation,'' said Jackson, who added that
Carter ``has earned the respect of all of us.''
   ``Then at that time, we'll look at the next step of our
challenge,'' said Jackson, who plans to meet with top advisers to
discuss convention rules and determine the best steps for next week.
   Jackson's reaction will be key at convention next week and on
Thursday he displayed both hurt feelings about his treatment during
the Bentsen selection and determination to continue talks with
Dukakis' forces.
   ``Inclusion is the watchword,'' Jackson said. ``We want
inclusion in the party at every level.
   ``As we seek to resolve the creative tensions within our party,
we are determined to set and keep a moral tone,'' that excludes
battles over personal issues, he said.
   Jackson said he hopes his forces came resume the stalled
negotiations with the Dukakis' camp on the party platform, but said
his backers ``will be debating minority planks'' at the convention.
   He said negotiations with Dukakis ``must be built based on
shared power and shared responsibility.''
   Asked about other issues he might want to settle with Dukakis,
Jackson insisted his fundamental role as a force in the party was
in question because ``at this point we're disconnected from the
process.''
   After the the stop in Indianapolis, the bus caravan will travel
to Louisville, Ky.; Nashville, Tenn., Chattanooga, Tenn. and
finally Atlanta.

   Banks raised the prime lending rate to the
highest level in more than two years Thursday, reflecting a rise in
their own borrowing costs and signaling more expensive loans for
consumers and businesses.
   The move from 9 percent to 9.5 percent marked the second time
this year the nation's banks have raised the prime, a key rate used
to calculate a range of fixed and adjustable-rate corporate and
consumer loans.
   Chase Manhattan Bank in New York was the first to announce the
rate increase and others quickly matched it, putting the prime at
the highest point since March 1986.
   Economists had been expecting such a move because of evidence
that the Federal Reserve has tightened credit over the past few
months through its control of the amount of money in the banking
system. This control is one of the Fed's principal weapons to
forestall higher inflation.
   The rate increase came one day after the central bank's
chairman, Alan Greenspan, told Congress in his twice-annual report
that the Fed had been tightening and that holding down inflation
remained his key priority. Some economists saw a significant
connection between his remarks and the banks' action.
   ``This is one of the few times the Fed really has to say
publicly what it's going to do, so we wanted to see that,'' said
John Oliver Wilson, chief economist at Bank of America in San
Francisco. ``The prime would have gone up no matter what he said,
but it was a question of how much.''
   M. Kathryn Eickhoff, president of the Eickhoff Economics
consulting firm and a former policy director in the Office of
Management and Budget, said the increase in the prime was
relatively moderate, reflecting confidence in Greenspan's
prediction that interest rates would not rise dramatically this
year.
   Others said the prime rate increase had little or nothing to do
with Greenspan's remarks and merely compensated for the rising
costs of borrowing that banks have been facing.
   These costs have narrowed the difference between what banks pay
for money in the credit markets and what they charge to lend it,
known as he spread, which is how banks make their profit.
   An important indicator of bank costs is the federal funds rate,
the interest on overnight loans between banks. The rate has been
nudging upward toward 8 percent, compared with about 7 percent a
few months ago.
   Although many economists have said interest rates will not rise
much further before the November election, a few predicted more
prime rate increases into double-digit territory in the months
ahead, possibly by the end of summer, if the banks' cost of
borrowing keeps rising.
   ``Overall, this is just one more piece of ammuniion to show that
interest rates are headed up,'' said William Veronda, portfolio
strategist and credit market economist at Financial Programs Inc.,
a Denver investment firm.

   A New York City woman who allegedly
gave birth in an airliner restroom and left her newborn daughter in
a mass of blood-soaked towels pleaded innocent Thursday to a charge
of child endangerment.
   Christina Marie Locasto, 24, appeared in an orange jail jumpsuit
at her arraignment on the felony charge in San Mateo County
Municipal Court. If convicted, she could face up to six years in
prison.
   Her lawyer said Locasto, who is married and the mother of a
young daughter, regrets the incident and wants to keep the baby.
   Earlier Thursday, Locasto had been booked for investigation of
attempted murder.
   ``To prove attempted murder we have to prove beyond a reasonable
doubt an intent to kill, that by her act she intended that the
child would die,'' said Assistant District Attorney Stephen
Wagstaffe. ``But the evidence now before us does not establish
that.''
   After posting $50,000 bail in cash, a distraught-looking Locasto
left the San Mateo County Women's Correctional Facility late
Thursday afternoon, arm in arm with her husband, Louis. A
preliminary hearing was set for Aug. 9.
   Louis Locasto, 26, who was on the plane trip with her and their
3-year-old daughter, Janine, was not arrested and apparently didn't
know his wife was pregnant, San Mateo County Sheriff's Lt. Mike Dow
said.
   Detectives identified the woman through the passenger list, and
she turned herself in Thursday morning, a day after arriving in San
Francisco from Newark, N.J., said Dow.
   ``We had information she gave birth to the baby on the East
Coast before the plane took off, hid the baby ... disembarked the
aircraft and went to visit relatives,'' he said. ``Which means the
baby was beneath the sink for over six hours.''
   ``They've run tests all day yesterday and last night, and we're
waiting for the results, but the baby seems just fine,'' said Ann
Fyfe, spokeswoman for Mills Memorial Hospital in San Mateo.
   Dozens of callers offered to adopt the 8-pound, 9-ounce baby,
named Elizabeth by hospital nurses, following widespread publicity
about her birth.
   John L. Williams, an attorney for the woman, said outside the
courtroom that his client was ``very remorseful, very distraught.''
   ``I'm confident she did not plan to have the child on the
plane,'' he said.
   He would not comment further on the reasons for the incident but
said Locasto told him she wants to keep the baby. A court hearing
Monday will be held to determine whether county officials should be
given pe
DC-10 landed at San Francisco International Airport after a 5{-hour
flight.
   ``The cleaning crew heard the baby crying, and that was what led
them to the baby,'' said Rob Doughty, an airline spokesman in
Chicago.
   Except for blood on a seat, there was no trace of the mother,
who had disappeared with the other 252 passengers, detectives said.
   Flight attendants told investigators that as the crew was
preparing for takeoff, a female passenger asked to use the
bathroom. The flight was delayed for a half-hour as flight
attendants knocked on the restroom door, urging the woman to come
out so the trip could begin.
   The woman finally emerged and joined her husband and their young
child, investigators said. Flight attendants found the bathroom
splattered with blood, but sealed it off in the belief the woman
had an extreme case of diarrhea. It remained locked until after the
plane landed.
   Through the passenger list, sheriff's detectives contacted the
Locastos' relatives on the East Coast, and they contacted relatives
the couple was visiting in Los Altos, 25 miles south of San
Francisco, Dow said.
   None of Locasto's relatives were aware the 5-foot-7, 155-pound
woman was pregnant, Dow said.
   Late Wednesday night, Louis Locasto called sheriff's detectives,
beginning four hours of phone calls with investigators and the
district attorney's office, Dow said.
   Christina Locasto, accompanied by attorney Tom Nolan, turned
herself in at the Hall of Justice in Redwood City, the lieutenant
said.
   James Mayer, one of two physicians who operates the medical
clinic at San Francisco International Airport, treated the baby
before she was rushed to the hospital. He used dental floss to tie
off the umbilical cord.
   Baby Elizabeth was placed in the custody of the county
Children's Protective Services division. She will be placed in an
emergency foster home unless the mother wins custody, said Robert
McMillan, the division's head.
   There would be no problem finding a place for the newborn, he
added. ``We've had many, many calls from people who would like to
adopt the infant or provide foster care,'' he said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing Conservative Party retained the west
London district of Kensington in polling Thursday in the first
special parliamentary election of Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's third term, but saw its winning margin sharply cut.
   Voters in the polarized district, where royal palaces and
high-rise tenements crowd into three square miles, re-elected the
Conservatives with 9,829 votes against 9,014 for the second-placed
socialist opposition Labor Party.
   This represented a winning margin for the Conservatives over
Labor of 815 votes. At the general election in June 1987, the
Conservatives' winning margin over Labor in the 48,500-voter
district was 4,500.
   Bookmakers favored the Conservatives to win. But many political
commentators considered Labor had a good chance of victory and
Bryan Gould, Labor's trade and industry spokesman, described the
Kensington result announced early Friday as a bitter disappointment
for his party.
   The campaign in Kensington, which contains thousands of highly
transient apartment-dwellers, was dull and only 51 percent of
eligible voters bothered to cast their ballots.
   The Conservatives' Dudley Fishburn, 42, an Eton- and
Harvard-educated former senior editor on the respected weekly, The
Economist, was put on the defensive during a lackluster campaign by
Thatcher plans for an unpopular new property tax.
   But Labor's Ann Holmes, 41, had to campaign against a background
of disarray in the British socialist movement over its
controversial anti-nuclear policy.
   William Goodhart, 55, of the Social and Liberal Democratic
Party, came third with 2,546 votes. Businessman John Martin, 52, of
the Social Democratic Party, came fourth with 1,190 votes.
   The Kensington poll was the first parliamentary test where
Britain's two centrist parties paid the price for an acrimonious
merger last spring of their former electoral alliance.
   Both the merged party, the Social and Liberal Democratic Party,
and the breakaway Social Democratic Party ran candidates, thus
splitting the already minority centrist vote.
   The election was caused by the death last November of
Conservative legislator Sir Brandon Rhys Williams, who represented
Kensington for 20 years.
   The district's plush southern end encompasses some of the most
beautiful parts of the British capital _ rows of elegant period
houses, Kensington Gardens and the palace where heir to the throne
Prince Charles, his aunt Princess Margaret and cousin Prince
Michael live in vast apartments.
   In north Kensington, working-class Britons and immigrants live
in shabby streets.
   At the last general election, which gave Mrs. Thatcher a third
consecutive victory, the Conservatives took 42.3 percent of the
vote, Labor 30.8 and the centrist alliance 22.5 percent.
   Since the election, she has pursued a radical program, including
a shakeup of the welfare system and education, and the new property
tax, which is aimed at undermining Labor councils but will more
than double some household tax bills.
   The Conservatives have a huge 101-seat majority in the
650-member House of Commons. The Conservatives have 375 seats,
Labor 229, the Social and Liberal Democrats 19 and the breakaway
SDP 3. The rest are held by minority regional parties.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas battling the
U.S.-backed government of President Jose Napoleon Duarte announced
on Thursday a transport ban on roads and highways nationwide
beginning at midnight.
   The ban was the fourth this year by guerrillas of the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front coalition and was announced in a
broadcast over their clandestine Radio Venceremos, monitored in
this capital city.
   The rebels said it was in response to security forces' use of
tear gas and clubs Tuesday to break up a demonstration of peasants
from farming cooperatives. The armed forces claimed the
demonstrators provoked the repression by damaging vehicles and
hitting soldiers.
   In the broadcast, the guerrillas also promised to step up
sabotage of the electrical distribution system. The rebels
regularly blow up high-tension line towers and utility poles to
black out whole sectors of the country.
   The transport bans usually last three days. Previous such
prohibitions succeeded in reducing nationwide road transport by up
to 90 percent. The guerrillas stopped and burned or fired on
vehicles violating the ban.

   A jury began deliberations Thursday in
the case of three white lawmen accused of beating a black inmate to
death.
   The three officers _ former Hemphill Police Chief Thomas Ladner,
41, and Sabine County sheriff's deputies James ``Bo'' Hyden, 35,
and Bill Horton, 58 _ have denied they delivered the blows that led
to the death of Loyal Garner Jr., a black truck driver from
Florien, La.
   The three are accused of violating Garner's civil rights. If
convicted, they face up to life in prison.
   After deliberating about six hours, the jurors were ordered
sequestered for the night and were to resume their work Friday.
   Garner, 34, died Dec. 27 at a Tyler hospital, two days after
allegedly being beaten while in the Sabine County jail in Hemphill.
   ``The issue in this case is whether Loyal Garner was beaten
unlawfully and then was left to lie in his own blood,'' prosecutor
John Hannah said in final arguments to the jury Thursday.
   Hannah accused the three of conspiring to cover up the beating
by concocting a story that Garner was a drug dealer and was
extremely drunk when he was jailed.
   ``They knew they had seriously screwed up. What they had to do
was build up a defense that the man they killed was a dope
dealer,'' he said.
   Defense attorneys in their closing arguments challenged the
credibility of some of the state's witnesses, saying many were
inmates who were in the jail at the time and had long criminal
records.
   ``The question of whether anybody had been beaten depends on
credibility,'' said John Seale, Ladner's attorney. ``Why, suddenly,
have these three leopards changed their spots and suddenly become
crooked, conniving and dirty men? These three men did not get
together and make up anything.''
   Seale also said Ladner was justified in striking Garner with a
slapstick once during a jail scuffle Christmas night.
   All three officers took the stand Wednesday as testimony in the
two-week trial ended. All denied causing Garner's death.
   If the jury convicts any of the three, the defendants have
agreed to allow State District Judge O'Neal Bacon to determine
punishment.
   The three also have been charged with murder in Garner's death,
and that trial is scheduled to begin Monday in Tyler.

<HEAD>White House Voices Support For Contra Aid Package</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House on Thursday expressed support
of a $47.1 million aid package introduced in the Senate for the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels, despite some problems with the ``fine
print.''
   The outline of the package _ including $20 million in military
aid and $27.1 million in humanitarian aid through next March _ was
introduced late Wednesday by Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of
Kansas.
   ``He offered it as a freestanding measure, but it will be slated
for action as an amendment to an appropriations bill,'' Dole aide
Walt Riker said Thursday.
   Under the measure, aid to the rebels opposing Nicaragua's
leftist Sandinista government would be authorized only after the
president certifies that it is necessary and after both houses of
Congress approve it.
   Asked about White House involvement in the creation of the
package, Riker said, ``We've been in consultation with them, but
we've taken the lead on it.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Thursday that the
White House was working with Congress on a new Contra aid bill and
said Dole has been ``very helpful'' in this effort.
   ``We may not agree with all the fine print in the bill, but we
think it's a very productive bill,'' Fitzwater said as he flew with
President Reagan from Washington to Marion, Ill., for a one-day
trip to see drought-ravaged farmland in the Midwest and to offer
moral support for farmers there.
   When Reagan was asked Wednesday whether he was supporting
efforts to get a new Contra aid package through Congress, he
responded, ``You bet I am.''
   Fitzwater's comments came the same day the House voted 385-18 to
condemn the Sandinista government for ``brutal suppression of basic
human rights.''
   The House action was similar to one approved by the Senate 91-4
on Wednesday, except that the Senate version threatened the
possible renewal of military aid to the Contras.
   Anger in Congress was triggered by the Sandinista government's
arrests of more than 40 people, including opposition leaders, and
the closing down of the opposition newspaper La Prensa and a Roman
Catholic radio station. In addition, Nicaragua this week expelled
eight U.S. diplomats, including Ambassador Richard Melton, an
action that prompted the Reagan administration to order the
expulsion of eight Nicaraguan diplomats, including Ambassador
Carlos Tunnermann.
   ``Obviously (Nicaraguan President Daniel) Ortega has given us a
real gift to rally support for the freedom fighters,'' Riker said.
``There's a real chance now to get Contra aid again. There's going
to be some Democratic support. We've talked to some of the
Democrats already.''
   In February, Congress rejected a $36.2 million package which
included a proposed $3.5 million for a military escrow account.
   In late March, it approved a $48 million measure providing only
humanitarian aid for Nicaragua through Sept. 30, and only $17
million of that was earmarked for the Contras.

   Polish television has served viewers a

eager crowds of Poles, who offer flowers or urge him to autograph a
copy of his book.
   But the gatherings are less spontaneous than they seem.
   Flower merchant Jozefa Paslawska pointed to the four copies of
the book ``Perestroika'' on Soviet reforms, prominently displayed
in front of her flowers.
   Ms. Paslawska did not show up on the Krakow market square

   Like the rest of the hundreds of Poles who closed in on

   Jesse Jackson heads to Atlanta today looking for
signals from Michael Dukakis on their future relationship as he
ponders whether to launch a showdown at the Democratic convention.
   On Wednesday, Jackson may have fueled the passions of those who
want to run him against Dukakis' vice presidential choice by saying
the floor was ``wide open'' on the vice presidential vote next
Thursday night.
   Jackson's departure by bus caravan to the convention city comes
as many of his supporters are still reeling from what they
considered a snub by Dukakis in failing to fully consult Jackson on
his choice of a running mate, and in not notifying him of that
choice before word leaked out.

   Angola, Cuba and South Africa agreed that
Pretoria will end its 73-year rule in South-West Africa and that
Cuban troops will leave Angola, but did not set a schedule for the
Cuban pullout.
   Private meetings among the negotiators began Monday under tight
security at the U.S. Coast Guard station on Governors Island in New
York Harbor and concluded Wednesday at their hotel.
   ``As a result of these 2{ days, the Angolans, Cubans, and South
Africans were able to reach agreement on a set of principles which
constitute the essential elements of a political settlement in
southwestern Africa,'' said Chester A. Crocker, under-secretary of
state in charge of African affairs, who led the host American
delegation.
   Crocker said the South African administration in South-West
Africa, also known as Namibia, would be replaced by U.N. civil and
military administrators to comply with a U.N. resolution calling

   Seven men indicted on charges they violated federal
neutrality laws by helping the Nicaraguan Contras say the Reagan
administration betrayed their patriotic fervor and abandoned them
as scapegoats.
   ``They used them and then abused them,'' Doug Jones, attorney
for Thomas Posey, said of the administration. ``You will never hear
one iota of evidence that anyone asked them to stop.''
   The federal indictment unsealed Wednesday named seven men,
including the brother of Contra leader Adolfo Calero, but no U.S.
administration officials or top Contra figures as some had
expected, even though the early stages of the probe helped uncover
the Iran-Contra military supply network.
   ``The indictment speaks for itself,'' said John Mattes, a
federal public defender whose investigation of a client's case led
to accusations that federal prosecutors tried to sidetrack the
probe. ``No one of substance was indicted.''

   Stunned worshippers gathered for Bible
study without their church's pastor, who was in jail today accused
of killing his live-in girlfriend and burying her hours before
giving his Sunday sermon.
   ``Everybody's just knocked out and surprised,'' said Hezekiah
Butler, chairman of the board of deacons for Zion Traveler
Missionary Baptist Church, one of three churches served by the Rev.
Jonathan Hamlin.
   ``He's been a wonderful pastor and a wonderful young man. You've
never run across a finer person in the world,'' Butler said.
   Hamlin, 24, was arrested Monday by the Warren County Sheriff's
Department, accused of fatally shooting 24-year-old Lula Sims. Held
on $100,000 bond, he won't be required to enter a plea until a
grand jury issues an indictment.
   Authorities say Hamlin shot Sims in the head and chest on July
3, buried her body in woods about 40 miles southeast of Vicksburg,
and hours later preached during Sunday morning worship at Zion
Traveler.

   George Bush's speech to the U.N. Security
Council, voicing compassion for victims of a U.S.-downed Iranian
airliner while insisting that Iran share responsiblity, gave the
vice president a forum for displaying traits he has hoped to
project in his White House campaign.
   The high-profile address on Thursday, in which Bush looked
straight at his Iranian accuser and told him ``of course we care,''
was viewed by aides as a demonstration of his leadership,
compassion and foreign-policy credentials.
   Bush's expressions of regret went further than his past reaction
to the downing of the plane, which he previously had called ``just
an unhappy incident'' while telling audiences ``life goes on.''

   President Reagan, lending moral support to

said Thursday the government must act quickly to help America cope
with the ``worst natural disaster since the Dust Bowl of the
1930s.''
   ``What I saw was not a pretty sight,'' Reagan said after walking

``Stunted corn, sparse beanfields, withered plants starved for
water, struggling to push their way through.''
   He promised farmers that ``we will do everything that we can.''
At the same time, he called on Congress to ``act quickly'' on a

   Final results released Wednesday night by the Federal Election
Commission, a week after the polls closed, gave Salinas the victory

Revolutionary Party, or PRI, has controlled Mexico.
   The opposition also won Senate seats for the first time, taking
four out of 64.
   The PRI-dominated election commission said Salinas received 9.64
million votes, or 50.36 percent, far below the 70 percent level
that was the minimum victory level for the governing party
presidential candidate in the past.
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist National Democratic Front was

forecast is contingent on a slowdown in overall economic growth.
   If this expected slowdown does not occur and inflationary
pressures remain high, then their interest rate forecasts will be

<HEAD>Duke Ellington Celebrated on `American Masters'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Duke Ellington was such a prolific composer and
profound influence on American music that it takes the PBS series
``American Masters'' two installments to tell his story.
   The first half of producer-director Terry Carter's vivid
portrayal, ``A Duke Named Ellington,'' airs Monday night on the
Public Broadcasting Service. The second half can be seen next
Monday, July 25.
   The documentary includes rare performance footage from Europe
never before seen in the United States and interviews with many of
the musicians who played in Ellington's band, which stayed together
for a record 47 years.
   Ellington, who died in 1974, began his career in Harlem. He says
in interview footage that there was a lot of tough competition from
the many pianists on the busy music scene, guys like Count Basie,
Willie ``The Lion'' Smith and James P. Johnson.
   ``But I'm lucky,'' Ellington says. ``Everybody liked me.''
   Suave, handsome and charismatic, Ellington was also a shrewd
businessman who entered into a productive partnership with music
publisher Irving Mills. It was Mills who was instrumental in
getting Ellington a gig at the Cotton Club. The documentary
includes tape of an announcer introducing Ellington as the
``greatest living master of jungle music.''
   Ellington's association with Mills, according to Ellington,
helped break down racial barriers in the music industry. And at a
time when blacks were being insulted by Hollywood stereotypes,
Ellington and the band appeared in their first movie in 1930,
``Check and Double Check.'' Ellington's cool, sophisticated style
gave black Americans a positive self-image.
   It seems he was as charismatic to his musicians as he was to his
fans.
   ``I consider myself privileged to sit in Duke Ellington's band
for 28 years,'' says Russell Procope. ``Any musician you talk to,
whether white, black, grizzled or gray, wanted to play with Duke
Ellington's band, believe me.''
   In 1943, Ellington hired clarinetist Jimmy Hamilton, whose
smooth, Benny Goodman-ish sound was a departure from the New
Orleans-style jazz that was prevalent among black musicians. In an
interview, Hamilton recalls his reluctance at joining Ellington's
band because he was working well enough and didn't want to go on
the road.
   He also recalls with relish how he would practice constantly to
keep up with Ellington's increasingly complex compositions.
   ``He put some music up and I'd say, `Hey, that's difficult, man,
I don't know if I can make that.' You were always trying to stay a
little ahead of him because he was going to try to get you sooner
or later.''
   Hamilton said he managed the piece quite well, and Ellington
took the same music to Goodman, who, without benefit of practice,
didn't do such a good job. Ellington came back gloating, according
to Hamilton, and said, ```Ah! I found out Benny's human!'''
   Ellington's relationship with sax player Johnny Hodges was not
so genial. According to critic Leonard Feather, Hodges' riffs would
sometimes get turned into compositions by Ellington, and Hodges
felt he was due some proceeds. When Ellington would play the piece,
said Feather, ``Johnny would start making motions with his hands,
like counting money, you know. And that went on actually on the
bandstand.''
   Part 2, which follows Ellington's later career, opens with
Ellington and the band playing the classic ``Take the `A' Train,''
which in fact was written by collaborator Billy Strayhorn.
   That number is followed by another classic, ``Mood Indigo.''
   ``I think we played that every night for 28 years,'' said
Procope. ``I never got tired of it, because every night it was like
the first time.''
   In an interview, Ellington is asked about his relationship to
``his'' people. ``THE people,'' he responds. ``That's the better
word. THE people rather than MY people. Becuase THE people are MY
people.''

   Despite foreboding, bus czar Fred G. Currey and
his investor groups sank millions last year into rebuilding the
declining bus industry over the long haul.
   They bought Greyhound Lines in March 1987 and few months later
acquired Trailways Inc., forming the largest inter-city bus company
in the nation.
   Now, the merger has received the blessing of the Interstate
Commerce Commission, and the bus lines boast increased ridership
after five years of decline.
   ``We know there are some things wrong with the system but ...
we're dedicated to bringing the system back,'' said Currey, a
former Trailways director.
   But Currey's venture to make the bus a formidable transportation
force hasn't been a smooth ride so far. He relates it as a good
news, bad news story.
   After slashing fares as much as 50 percent and unleashing the
biggest advertising blitz in years by either bus line, Greyhound's
ridership surged.
   The bad news is the bus company wasn't prepared, Currey said.
   Terminals were packed, ticket lines were long, luggage and
packages were lost and buses were delayed.
   ``We had a lot of service deficiencies and we had (them) because
we were putting together the two largest bus companies in the
nation,'' he said.
   Although he is optimistic the company can overcome its problems,
Currey acknowledges the only way the bus can make a comeback is by
improving long-deteriorating quality.
   His plans to refuel the bus lines include faster ticketing,
refurbished and secure terminals, computerized routing,
airline-competitive prices and all-around upgraded service.
   ``We have a fundamental belief in the viability of the business
and that really is in sharp contrast with the attitude that the
previous owners had about the industry and the business,'' Currey
said.
   GLI Holding Co. Inc., an investor group led by Currey, acquired
Greyhound Lines for $350 million. The acquisition occurred amid
declining ridership and labor disputes between union members and
Phoenix-based Greyhound Corp.
   Trailways Inc. was on the brink of collapse when another Currey
group, GLI Acquisition Inc., spent $80 million to buy some of its
fleet, garages and terminals in July 1987.
   Despite ICC misgivings that merging the two companies could
violate antitrust laws, the buyouts were given temporary approval
and on May 17 the merger was endorsed.
   ``A company like Greyhound faces significant competition,'' said
Michael Redisch, chief of research and analysis in the ICC's office
of Transportation Analysis.
   ``Buses are the people's last choice. If the airline won't go
there and it's too far to drive, the bus is the last choice. The
bus is also hurt by driving and the growth of the automobile,''
Redisch said.
   ``It's a hard way to make a living.''
   Don't tell that to Currey. He's operating on the premise that
the bus and its workers are just suffering from neglect.
   ``The previous owners of Greyhound, and even to a modest extent
Trailways, had kind of a going-out-of-business attitude that was
conveyed to the marketplace,'' said Craig Lentzsch, Greyhound Lines
vice chairman and executive vice president. ``So our coming on
board and saying, `We're here for the long pull,' I think had a
positive effect on the marketplace.''
   In 1987 Greyhound Lines _ which runs buses under the
recognizable Trailways name but stamps them with the running
greyhound logo _ logged 6.3 billion passenger miles, up from 6.1
billion in 1986, ICC statistics show. Passenger miles are the total
number of miles ridden by paying passengers.
   Greyhound predicts a 2.4 percent increase in passenger miles in
1988, said company spokesman George Gravley.
   From March 19, 1987, to Dec. 31, 1987, the company lost $27.4
million, Gravley said.
   ``We got the revenues we expected and the profit was somewhat
lower than anticipated because we incurred such substantial
increased costs'' in consolidation, Currey said.
   Although the company faces $326 million in long-term debt, the
sale of $150 million in senior notes has allowed it to retire some
short-term bank debts with higher interest payments and to pour
about $65 million into sorely needed bus purchases.
   In an October company newsletter, Jim Malcomb, senior vice
president of maintenance, said 387 of Trailways' 1,127 buses would
not run, 85 needed engines that were not in stock and many more
were parked because of deferred maintenance.
   Since its purchase, the company has added 325 new buses _ 275
MCI buses purchased from a subsidiary of Greyhound Corp. and 50
from Eagle International Inc., a Greyhound Lines subsidiary.
   The bus line subscribes to an airline computer reservation
system, SABRE, and uses it to compete with airline prices.
   ``We simply cannot survive in this business with the poor
quality we provided many of our customers this past summer,''
Currey told employees in the October newsletter.
   After the chaotic summer, Currey directed executives to ask
employees what they would do to fix the company's shortcomings.
   As a result, computers have been installed at Greyhound
telephone centers, replacing complicated and often incorrect
schedule reading, Gravley said.
   By July 15, the company expects to have new systems that will
spit out a ticket in 30 seconds in 100 of the nation's largest bus
terminals.
   Many depots, including Dallas', are being remodeled, expanded or
moved. A one-story schoolhouse in Evansville, Ind., is being
restored to historical standards to serve as a bus terminal.
   ``The business is alive and well,'' Currey said at a recent
employee meeting in Dallas, ``and we as outstanding people have
within our grasp, if we act as a team, the best transportation
company in America.''

<TEXT>
   The veiled Arab woman checked in at the
desk, Reeboks peeping from under her abaya, the black, shroud-like
robe Moslem women wear.
   In the locker room, she shed the robe to reveal the latest in
latex exercise gear. Within minutes, she was gyrating to the
pounding beat of the aerobics class music.
   Physical fitness is a sensitive subject in the Arab world, where
religion and custom decree that women's bodies, and sometimes their
faces, be covered.
   Even in the relatively Westernized Arab states on the Persian
Gulf, many women, young and old, adhere to tradition, walking the
streets in their abayas.
   But the female fitness craze has arrived, and among gulf women
it is just beginning to hit its stride.
   In another Manama gym, a young girl in red stretch jogging pants
and a T-shirt reading ``Bye Bye Worry'' is one of 33 Arab women,
all physical fitness instructors, taking a training seminar.
   The women, 19 to 34 years old, have been training for two years
and now teach their own community courses, currently drawing about
1,300 women.
   Kathy James, an American sports specialist and guest instructor
for the seminar sponsored by the U.S. Information Service and the
Bahrain Sports Institute, says she was surprised to find such an
active group in the Arab world.
   ``I think they're becoming more aware of how important it is to
keep your body physically fit,'' she said.
   Medical experts say oil wealth and other factors beginning in
the 1970s have helped bring about changes in eating habits.
Saturated fats, refined sugars and processed foods have become part
of the diet and people are adopting a luxury-loving, more sedentary
lifestyle.
   ``It's overindulgence,'' said Dr. Essa Amin, chief of the
medical staff at Bahrain's Defense Force Hospital.
   ``There's definitely a link between the diet habit, the lack of
exercise and higher incidence of diabetes, cardiac and
cardio-circulatory problems.''
   Interest in fitness has been encouraged by European and other
expatriate women who bring a more active, sports-oriented lifestyle
to the region.
   Apart from those operated at major hotels, Bahrain now has about
15 women's fitness centers in schools, gymnasiums and private
health clubs and health studios also operate in nearby Dubai and
Abu Dhabi.
   In Cairo, Egypt, aerobics instructor Samia Allouba has kept her
popular television show going despite Islamic fundamentalist
opposition that, she says, has included telephone threats and
street taunts from both men and women.
   She compromises by wearing discreet, high-collared tops with
long sleeves during her TV presentations.
   But having crusaded for female fitness for eight years, she now
thinks she's winning. Egyptian as well as foreign women fill her
suburban Cairo studio from morning to night.
   ``In the last two years, I've noticed a definite change in the
attitudes of women,'' she said in a telephone interview. ``They've
become more interested in becoming healthy.''
   Odette Alagasi, aerobics instructor at Bahrain's Gulf Hotel,
said that when she arrived from the Philippines more than a year
ago, virtually all her students were foreign women. Now at least
one-fourth are local.
   Alagasi, 24, said most of her students enroll to lose weight and
aren't aware of such things as the cardiovascular benefits of
exercise.
   Mona Al-Ansari, 29, who has trained the 33 aerobics and fitness
instructors for the Bahrain government's Council for Youth and
Sports, says Arab women, naturally shy, are more at ease in being
taught by another Arab.
   ``We understand their special needs. ... They trust us to do
their classes for them,'' she said. ``Before, they didn't have the
chance to do anything like this for themselves. Now the opportunity
is there.
   ``Wives, mothers and girls, women from 12 to 60 years old, are
coming to classes. And I like to encourage the women to do sports,
to be on a level with the men.''
   The advocates of exercise say they see is no conflict with the
teachings of Islam.
   Instructor Al-Ansari quotes the prophet Mohammed as saying,
``The strong Moslem is better than the weak Moslem.''

<HEAD>O'Connor, Koch: Give Prayer a Chance in Divided Ireland</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note trip begins Thursday, July 21</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardinal John O'Connor, Mayor Edward Koch and
several hundred other pilgrims head off this week on a peace
mission to Ireland, hoping prayer can succeed where 800 years of
violence have failed.
   ``I think (prayer) is an area that's been totally neglected as a
possible key to peace with justice, and I think maybe our doing
this will catch on,'' O'Connor said last week. ``I believe in the
tremendous power of prayer.''
   That power will be tested mightily in Northern Ireland, where
more than 2,600 people have been killed in the two decades since
the Irish Republican Army revived its war against British rule.
   This is a land where even a pilgrimage for peace and justice can
accentuate divisions: if peace means the status quo, the IRA would
rather fight; if justice means change, many Protestants would do
the same.
   O'Connor called for the pilgrimage on St. Patrick's Day after a
Protestant gunman killed three mourners and wounded 68 others at
the Belfast funeral of three IRA members.
   The idea came to him, the cardinal said, as he was speaking from
the altar of St. Patrick's Cathedral. In an emotional sermon,
O'Connor bemoaned the lack of concern for Northern Ireland's
troubles by Americans, 40 million of whom trace their roots to the
island.
   ``Have we forgotten the very existence of Ireland, and the
horrors that have been perpetrated there for so many years?'' he
asked.
   The cardinal said he hoped 100,000 pilgrims would follow him.
But, possibly because people already had made their summer vacation
plans, or because they are bewildered and frustrated by Ulster's
seemingly intractable problems, fewer than 1,000 signed up.
   They include City Council President Peter Vallone, former Gov.
Hugh Carey and Steven McDonald, a New York City policeman who was
paralyzed when he was shot in the line of duty two years ago.
   They depart Thursday and arrive the next day in Knock, a town in
the west of the Irish Republic where Catholics believe Mary, mother
of Jesus, appeared in 1879.
   After three days of Masses and other services at the shrine
there, the group will spend several days in Dublin, with a side
trip across the border into Northern Ireland. O'Connor will say
Mass in Armagh with Cardinal Tomas O Fiaich, after a brief visit on
his own to Belfast.
   Since becoming archbishop of New York in 1984, O'Connor has
emerged as the U.S. church's leading spokesman on Northern Ireland
_ and one of the few American bishops ever to show much interest in
its troubles.
   The American Catholic hierarchy is dominated by Irish-Americans.
But other issues, such as arms control, and other places, such as
Central America, invariably get the attention.
   ``Where are the social activists, especially our priests and
nuns, who condemn oppression in the Third World, but are silent
about suffering in Ireland?'' O'Connor demanded on St. Patrick's
Day.
   Although the cardinal has consistently denounced violence, he
also has criticized British tactics and policies. He visited Joe
Doherty, an IRA member accused of murder, in jail in New York; he
publicly embraced Peter King, an IRA supporter who was elected
grand marshal of the 1985 St. Patrick's Parade.
   ``With his lips he condemns terror,'' editorialized the Daily
Mail of London. ``With his hand he slaps it on the back.''
   But his defenders say O'Connor treats IRA members much as he
does Catholics who disobey church teaching on birth control or
abortion: he condemns the sin, but not the sinner.
   O'Connor's tenure in New York has been marked by almost as much
controversy as Koch's, and some observers are worried the pair will
exacerbate tensions in a land where almost anything anybody says
offends somebody.
   Koch says the pilgrimage is so important he will skip the
Democratic National Convention. But the mayor, whose strident
rhetoric upstaged the candidates themselves in New York's
Democratic primary, is regarded warily by the British, the IRA and
Protestant para-military groups _ all of whom he has criticized.
   ``I think he can help, but I hope he'll be careful not to pick a
fight,'' said Charles J. Hynes, a state special prosecutor and
organizer of New York's Irish-American Unity Day.
   In interviews, prominent Irish-American IRA supporters endorsed
the trip, while IRA critics questioned its value.
   ``I would not cast doubt on the power of prayer,'' said Martin
Galvin of Irish Northern Aid, which has raised millions of dollars
for the IRA effort. Peter King said the pilgrimage ``has to do
good. ... Just by going the cardinal sends a message that he's
concerned.''
   But Padraig O'Malley of the University of Massachusetts at
Boston, an expert on Irish politics, voiced the consensus on the
other side of the issue: ``I don't think this trip will be
particularly helpful or useful.''
   O'Connor, he said, would have been better advised to organize a
clearly interdenominational group and share the leadership with
Episcopal and Presbyterian clergy.
   In Northern Ireland, O'Malley said, ``one must be sensitive to
symbolism, and the symbolism of this trip is all wrong.'' O'Connor,
he said, ``will be seen as the representative of one tradition.''
   Even Catholics are unlikely to be greatly encouraged by
O'Connor's visit, he said. ``There've been far too many Americans
on far too many trips through, far too many calls for peace. Even
the pope got on bended knee and asked for peace (in 1979). Everyone
praised him, and then went back to their ways.''

<DATELINE>AKIACHAK, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Willie Kasayulie was 13 when he had to
leave this Eskimo fishing village. It had no high school, and
bright kids like Willie were sent to distant boarding schools.
   Far from family and home, he polished his English, learned to
deal with ignorance about his culture and realized the depth of his
love for the land and his people.
   At 37, Willie Kasayulie is back home, putting the lessons of his
teen-age years to use. As chief of the Yupiit Nation, he leads a
coalition of 19 Yupik Eskimo villages in a battle with state and
federal officials over control of the villages' destiny.
   When Congress settled Alaska natives' land claims in 1971, it
tried to avoid the social ills endured by American Indians in the
lower 48 states. Instead of reservations run by tribal councils, it
set up corporations run by native shareholders. But now Kasayulie
and other native leaders, disappointed by the corporations'
performance, say the tribal way looks better all the time.
   Their efforts to assert tribal sovereignty are opposed by state
and federal officials, who fear that recognition of distinct tribes
in Alaska could split the state into an unmanageable hodgepodge of
independent enclaves.
   But Kasayulie, also a commercial fisherman, says that denying
tribal status is denying a culture its right to govern itself by
its traditions.
   ``They're trying to take away my cultural rights,'' said
Kasayulie. ``I don't want to forget who I am or where my roots are.
We've got our language, our history, and those are as important as
the history of the United States.''
   Akiachak, population 470, tucked among willows on an oxbow turn
of the muddy Kuskokwim River in southwestern Alaska, can be reached
only by boat or airplane in summer, by dog team or snowmobile in
winter.
   Despite its isolation, Akiachak is at the center of a movement
among rural Alaska natives to assert tribal control over education,
law enforcement, taxation, game regulations and other governmental
functions.
   The struggle is waged in legislative halls, courtrooms and the
native villages themselves:
   _ Akiachak residents voted in 1983 to replace their municipal
government with a tribal council. The council now runs the
village's water treatment plant, pays the salaries of three police
officers and levies a 2 percent sales tax. A panel of elders metes
out fines for minor crimes in the village. But the state recognizes
neither council nor panel as legitimate governing bodies.
   _ The Athabascan Indian village of Copper Center announced its
intention to tax the operators of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline,
which passes through traditional hunting grounds near the village.
The case is pending in federal district court.
   _ A non-native family expelled by Tyonek's tribal council sued
the village. A federal district court upheld the village's
sovereign immunity against such suits; an appeal is pending.
   Congress thought it was heading off such conflicts when it
passed the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act in 1971. Hailed as
the most generous settlement ever struck with native Americans, the
act granted Alaska's natives $963 million and 44 million acres in
exchange for dropping aboriginal land claims.
   The land and money were put under control of 12 regional
corporations and 200 village corporations.
   ``Congress said in ANCSA, `Look, the days of reservations are
over. We want you to be good businessmen and be part of the
American economic mainstream,''' said Thomas Morehouse, a
researcher at the University of Alaska's Institute for Social and
Economic Research.
   The law's boosters said the corporations would make money for
Alaska's 70,000 Eskimos, Aleuts and Indians, help develop the
state's resources and assimilate natives into modern society, while
addressing social problems such as alcoholism and suicide.
   In general, the corporations have failed to live up to those
grand expectations.
   Some have thrived, investing wisely and developing resources
such as timber or minerals. Others have foundered _ the regional
Bering Straits Native Corp. is in bankruptcy court, and many do no
more than fill out annual reports.
   But even successful corporations have paid out few dividends.
Alaska natives have received an average of only $800 in dividends
since 1971, said Janie Leask, president of the Alaska Federation of
Natives.

   ``Despite ANCSA and its millions, native people who had little
money before 1971 have little money today,'' said Thomas Berger, a
former British Columbia Supreme Court judge who spent two years
interviewing villagers across Alaska for the Inuit Circumpolar
Conference.
   Unemployment remains high in Alaska's villages. Alcoholism is
widespread, as liquor fuels the depression of a younger generation
skilled in neither the old subsistence traditions nor the modern
ways of a technological society. Alaska's young native men, aged 14
to 24, kill themselves at a rate four times the national average, a
recent study found.
   Disappointment in the corporate experiment turned to outrage
when it became obvious it could eventually lead to the loss of
native lands. ANCSA banned the sale of stock to non-natives until
1991, but natives realized their corporations would be diluted and
their land could slip from their grasp after that.
   The Yupiit Nation was born in this atmosphere of fear. In the
summer of 1984, Kasayulie and about 40 other native leaders drew up
a declaration of independence from outside forces.
   ``Our people have been in control for so many thousands of
years, determining their own destiny. With the advance of Western
society, the rules changed,'' he said.
   Native sovereignty is a way to change the rules back again, he
said.
   For example, Akiachak's panel of elders may confiscate a man's
riverboat if they find him guilty of disturbing the peace. If he
needs it for fishing to feed his family, they're likely to return
it, Kasayulie said.
   Tribal council meetings are conducted in Yupik, the language of
choice for most villagers, and great deference is paid to the
elders, Kasayulie said.
   Akiachak's brightest teen-agers can stay in the village these
days, attending a modern high school that features both computer
labs and lessons on building dog sleds.
   But Akiachak's tribal government is still underground as far as
state officials are concerned. The state won't budge on most tribal
issues, partly because sovereignty would discriminate against
whites living in predominantly native villages, said Douglas Mertz,
an assistant state attorney general.
   ``Non-natives would not have the right to participate in the
government,'' he said. ``They wouldn't have effective recourse if
their civil rights were violated. In fact, they could be booted out
of the community, even if they owned property and had lived there
all their lives.''
   State officials also worry that if each of Alaska's 200 native
villages sets up a separate jurisdiction, the result would be a
jumble of tax, environmental, and hunting and fishing regulations.
   Mertz is juggling a half-dozen cases involving tribal
sovereignty, and he expects to see more.
   That's because the courts have inherited the question from
Congress, which last winter amended the Claims Settlement Act. The
amendments continued the restrictions on stock ownership
indefinitely, relieving some of the natives' concerns, but
lawmakers rejected pleas to include language bolstering sovereignty
claims.
   So far, the courts have sent mixed signals concerning
sovereignty.
   Tribal advocates applauded the federal district court's 1986
decision upholding Tyonek's immunity.
   But the sovereignty movement was dealt a blow in May, when the
Alaska Supreme Court said Tyonek was an exception because it
occupied a reservation, later dissolved, in the 1930s. The court
said other Alaska villages are ineligible to claim sovereign
immunity because Congress never treated them as reservations or
tribes.
   Mertz said it would take more than one court case to untangle
the legal thicket surrounding native sovereignty. ``The one thing
about Indian law is that there are no certainties, and Indian law
in Alaska is even more that way,'' he said.
   Akiachak is not waiting for final word from the courts. Perhaps
the best argument for tribal sovereignty, Kasayulie said, is that
it works.
   ``If there's to be any dispute from the state or federal
government, let them prove that our tribal governments aren't
functioning,'' he said.
   ``I think they should make a comparison between tribal
government and city government to find out who is more responsible
to the villagers. I think they'd find the tribal government is
operating better than the city, even though we're operating with
less money.''

   Rein and Sirje Ruutsoo are Estonia's
version of the children of the 1960s. They wanted to take on the
establishment, but this was the Soviet Union.
   They had hopes for a revival of Estonian culture and political
power during the liberalization drive of Nikita S. Khrushchev after
years of Stalinism. But Khrushchev was ousted in 1964 and Leonid I.
Brezhnev rose to Kremlin leadership and any hopes the Ruutsoos had
were quickly dashed.
   Now, with Mikhail S. Gorbachev leading the nation and opening up
a closed society, the Ruutsoos are speaking their minds.
   So are many of their fellow Estonians and people living in the
two neighboring Soviet republics on the Baltic Sea, Latvia and
Lithuania.
   They want officials in Moscow to keep their hands off the
culture, language and economy of the Baltic states, home for 7.7
million people.
   By allowing the Soviet Union's many nationalities to vent long
pent-up demands, Gorbachev may gain popular support in Estonia and
other independent-minded republics.
   Estonia, with a 1.5 million population, is already among the
most Westernized of the 15 Soviet republics.
   Along with Latvia and Lithuania, Estonia had a brief taste of
independence _ 22 years _ between the two world wars and still
feels some kinship with the Finns who live just 50 miles across the
Gulf of Finland and whose language is akin to Estonian.
   But Estonians, Lithuanians and Latvians have lived under the
influence or domination of others since the 13th century, starting
with the German Teutonic Order. Then came the Swedes followed by
the czarists Russians in the early 18th century. With the collapse
of the Russian monarchy, and the defeat of Germany in World War I,
the Baltic states proclaimed independence in 1918. But under a
secret agreement with Nazi Germany, Josef Stalin's Soviet Union
annexed the Baltic states in 1940.
   Today, Switzerland-sized Estonia is on the front line of
Gorbachev's battle to build citizens' economic and political
initiative.
   Signs that Estonians are taking up his battle cry of
``perestroika'' _ Gorbachev's policy of restructuring of society _
are all about Tallinn, the picturesque ancient seaside capital:
   _Shops display colorful Western-style fashions unseen in other
Soviet stores.
   _Estonians march with their previously banned black, blue and
white national flag.
   _A nationalist emblem carved in stone on a city building but
covered up for as long as anyone can remember has suddenly
reappeared.
   _The Greens environmental group, branching out from West
Germany, has painted slogans with ecological demands on a barricade
wall at a construction site.
   _Long-banned plays with nationalist themes are allowed, and
interest in folk choirs has been renewed. A ``cultural
renaissance'' is taking place, says a musician.
   And the Ruutsoos: After years of underground activism that began
at Tartu University, Estonia's spawning ground for many cultural
figures, they now are central figures in a group called the
People's Front for Perestroika.
   ``All the People's Front leaders are idealists of the 1960s,''
explained Rein Ruutsoo, a 41-year-old philosopher and Communist
Party member. ``The 60s generation hoped to take over the Communist
Party. We had some illusions. Now it's our second chance.''
   Ruutsoo, who refuses to speak Russian to protest encroachment of
the Soviet Union's largest and most influential republic on
Estonian life, explained in English that he was among 40 Estonian
intellectuals who signed a letter in 1980 protesting what they saw
as the Russification of their culture.
   The KGB secret police accused his 39-year-old wife, Sirje, of
being a U.S. Central Intelligence agent for collecting half the
signatures on the letter. Two years later, she was expelled from
the Communist Party for writing a poem in which the first letters
of each line spelled the colors of the Estonian flag.
   In those days, Estonian television announcers were not permitted
to refer to the region as Estonia in weather reports, the Ruutsoos
recalled between sips of tea grown in the garden of their home.
They called it just ``the republic'' or ``the Baltic area.''
   Throughout the Ruutsoos' house, which has been in Rein's family
for four generations, is evidence that times have changed.
   An Estonian flag sits atop the television set, and they showed a
reporter a T-shirt imprinted with a map of Estonia and the words in
English, ``Go Home, Strangers!'' _ meaning the Russians.
   Gorbachev has said the Kremlin was mistaken in the past to
suppress national cultures and languages like Estonia's.
   He has promised to be more sensitive to the Soviet Union's more
than 100 ethnic groups, some of which are now among the most ardent
practitioners of his glasnost (openness) epolicy, using it to
express their long-repressed national or ethnic identities.
   The People's Front for Perestroika is one outgrowth of the new
tolerance. It sprang up in April when the Estonian philosopher
Edgar Savisaar proposed on television creating a democratic
movement to support perestroika. The group now has 900 affiliates
with 50,000 members in Estonia, Ruutsoo said, and sister
organizations have been formed in Latvia and Lithuania.
   While generally supporting Communist Party policies, the
People's Front demands ``political and economic sovereignty of
union republics (and) cultural autonomy for all nationalities.''
   It calls for direct Estonian trade ties outside of Moscow's
control with foreign companies and says it intends to propose
legislation and up candidates for government posts. The only
condition for membership is ``active and businesslike support of
the course of perestroika.''
   At first, the established leadership in Estonia, apparently
fearing a challenge to its authority, denied the new group access
to the republic-controlled press.
   But on June 16, the republic's party chief, Karl Vaino, a
holdover from the Brezhnev years, was replaced by Vajno Vyalyas, a
Gorbachev protege and former Soviet ambassador to Nicaragua who
already had respect among Estonian intellectuals.
   The next day, 150,000 people gathered in a meadow outside
Tallinn to show their support for the People's Front and to ask
Estonia's delegates to the nationa Communist Party conference in
Moscow to press the group's demands.
   The delegation, led by Vyalyas, endorsed the front's demands for
local control over the republic's finances, environmental policy,
culture and education and pleaded their case before the 5,000
Communists who assembled in the Kremlin June 28-July 1 to set party
policy.
   The delegation's platform also calls for limiting migration to
Estonia, where ethnic Estonians now make up just 60 percent of the
population. The republic was 90-percent Estonian in 1940.
   The Estonian delegates to the party conference in Moscow appear
to have won much of what they sought, at least in principle. The
conference adopted a resolution saying republics were entitled to
greater independence in economic, social, cultural and ecological
spheres.
   The People's Front stops short, however, of calling for
secession from the Soviet Union, but Ruutsoo says it's generally
assumed the goal is ``a revival of an independent Estonia.''
   Sirje Ruutsoo doesn't conceal her own thoughts.
   ``It's a revolution,'' she said. ``The only thing is tanks are
on the other side. That's the only reason we don't have a new
republic already.''

   Estonia's new Communist Party chief,
Vajno Vyalyas, is a native son attempting the delicate task of
steering his republic away from Moscow's tight grip.
   The 57-year-old descendant of Estonian fishermen and seamen took
office in June in the midst of a vigorous populist movement that is
seeking more economic, cultural and political independence from the
Kremlin.
   Such movements had been suppressed under Vyalyas' predecessor,
Karl Vaino, who is remembered by activists here for intolerance and
a poor command of the Estonian language.
   Vyalyas, a history graduate of Estonia's prestigious Tartu
University, doesn't hide his roots.
   ``I was born and raised on this land,'' he said in an interview.
``This is my homeland.''
   ``On this land worked my ancestors,'' he added. ``I myself am a
historian, and through church lists I managed to ascertain that
seven generations of them worked on the island Hiiumaa,'' an island
just off the coast.
   The brown-haired, hazel-blue-eyed Vyalyas spoke in his office in
Communist Party headquarters in Tallinn, Estonia's capital. Among
the few decorations in his office were portraits of Vladimir I.
Lenin, founder of the Soviet state, and Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev and Vyalyas both worked in the 1950s and early 1960s
in the Communist Party's youth organization, Komsomol _ Gorbachev
in his home region of Stavropol in southern Russia and at Moscow
State University, and Vyalyas in Tartu and Tallinn. Vyalyas went on
to lead the city party organization in Tallinn for 10 years before
being elected a party secretary for the republic-wide party
apparatus.
   After being passed over for the Estonian party chief's job in
1978, Vyalyas joined the Soviet diplomatic corps, serving as
ambasssador to Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, and Nicaragua.
   Estonian intellectuals say Vyalyas' diplomatic experience may be
helpful in winning the battle for more Estonian independence.
   Vyalyas talks about making Estonia more economically independent
of Moscow and preserving its culture and language. But he adheres
to the Soviet principle of ``internationalism,'' the mix of
national groups under one, Soviet umbrella.
   But he adds a flavoring of his own heritage to it.
   ``Islanders are always by nature big internationalists,''
Vyalyas said, chuckling. ``They were all seamen and always said,
`Any port is my home.'''

<HEAD>West German Company To Purchase Majority Interest In Bendix</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Siemens AG, the billion-dollar West
German electronics and telecommunications giant, agreed in
principle Thursday to purchase a majority interest in Allied-Signal
Inc.'s Bendix Electronics Group for between $200 million and $300
million.
   The new company, Siemens-Bendix Automotive Electronics, will be
based in Southfield, Mich. and will continue under Bendix's present
management. It will concentrate on the development and application
of advanced electronic technology to the automotive industry, the
firms said.
   Siemans and Allied-Signal agreed in December to establish a
joint venture in automotive electronics. Negotiations over Bendix
intensified after that, resulting in Thursday's announcement, said
Allied-Signal spokesman Michael Ascolese.
   Terms of the sale, including the final size of the stake Siemens
will acquire, were expected to be finalized by the end of the year,
he said.
   Allied-Signal said it would use the proceeds from the sale to
reduce part of its debt.
   J. Mason Reynolds, president of Allied-Signal Automotive, said
the sale of the majority interest in Bendix will allow
Allied-Signal to focus its attention on automotive markets in which
it is an industry leader.
   Morris Township-based Allied Signal had a profit of $656
million, or $3.90 per share, on sales of $11.1 billion in 1987.
   Siemens, with headquarters in Berlin and Munich, reported
worldwide sales last year of more than $30 billion, said Martin
Weitzner, spokesman for Siemens Capital Corp., the New York-based
holding company for Siemens in the United States.

   President Reagan is promising to do all he can
to protect farmers from excessive losses during the drought that is
afflicting large areas of the nation.
   But On the eve of his inspection tour of southern Illinois
drought areas Wednesday, he cautioned, ``We mustn't bust the
budget.''
   Agriculture experts say that up to 4 inches of rain in the
flatland region won't help much of the already damaged corn crop.
But the Reagan visit, they say, is a good gesture on the
president's part and should help get federal aid for farmers who
have substantial crop loss.

   Crude oil prices have slumped to a 21-month low
amid growing pessimism about overproduction by OPEC members.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the August-delivery price
of West Texas Intermediate crude, which fell 6 cents on Tuesday,
fell another 28 cents Wednesday to close at $14.44 per barrel.
   The last time prices for the near month WTI contract were lower
was Oct. 29, 1986, when they closed at $13.73 a barrel.
   Fears of continued overproduction by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries sent prices lower, said Andrew Lebow,
senior broker and analyst at E.D.&F. Man International Futures Inc.
   ``It's the same type of scenario that's burdened the market for
the last couple of weeks,'' he said.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the August
contract for wholesale unleaded tumbled 3 cents to close at 50.48
cents a gallon.
   Gasoline futures had fared better than oil in recent weeks
because of increased demand during the summer driving season. But
profit-taking and rumors that importers were buying foreign
gasoline to ease tight supplies took their toll on gas prices
Wednesday, Lebow said.
   The near month contract for home heating oil slipped 0.51 cent
to 40.14 cents a gallon.

   Even as it posted a big profit gain for its
second quarter and announced some major management changes, CBS
Inc. says a scriptwriters strike is clouding the outlook for the
broadcasting business.
   CBS reported Wednesday that its second-quarter profit climbed 40
percent to a record high, citing higher interest income, improved
operating efficiency and an increase in broadcast sales despite a
sluggish advertising market.
   But Laurence A. Tisch, president and chief executive of CBS,
said in announcing the results that the business outlook for
broadcasting for the balance of the year ``is somewhat uncertain
based largely on the continuing strike by the Writers Guild of
America.''
   The 19-week strike threatens to delay the start of the fall
television season, and some network executives fear that without a
slate of new programming viewers could look elsewhere for
entertainment and reduce the audience for commercials.
   However, Tisch said CBS had found demand for advance sales of
fall television time to advertisers was ``surprisingly strong.''
   The networks have been conducting their annual ``upfront'' ad
sales for the fall season over the past 10 days, and Tisch said he
agreed with published reports that said prime time sales could
match or exceed last year's total.
   The strong earnings performance by the CBS Broadcast Group also
figured in Wednesday's announcement that Howard Stringer, the
president of CBS News, would become president of the CBS Broadcast
Group. An ABC executive, David W. Burke, was selected to head the
news division.
   Effective Aug. 1, Stringer replaces Gene F. Jankowski, 54, who
has been president of the broadcast group for 11 years and will
take the newly created post of broadcast group chairman. Stringer,
46, will report directly to Tisch.
   Burke, 52, has been with ABC News for 11 years, the last two as
executive vice president. His appointment marks the first time CBS
has gone outside the company for the head of its news division.
   Tisch said Jankowski approached him last week suggesting that
with this year's program development schedule complete and
six-month earnings at a record level, it was appropriate for ``an
orderly transition'' in management of the broadcast group. In his
new role, Jankowski said, he will scout possible station
acquisitions among other things.
   The CBS Television Network struggled during the past season,
with its prime time ratings trailing NBC and ABC for the first time
ever.
   Financial analysts suggested the changes probably were
inevitable as Tisch made his mark on the company, which he has
headed since the fall of 1986.
   ``Larry's putting his man in charge, and Gene is probably taking
the first step out the door,'' said Edward Atorino, who follows the
media business for the investment firm Smith Barney, Harris Upham &
Co.
   Stringer, a 23-year veteran with CBS, had headed CBS News for 22
months, steering the news division through controversial layoffs
and budget cuts while still managing to launch a news show, ``48
Hours,'' and keep three prime-time news hours on the fall schedule.
   Phil Jones, general manager of KCTV in Kansas City, Mo., and
former chairman of the CBS affiliates board, said Stringer's
performance indicates he ``will be good person to do business
with.''
   In its earnings report, CBS said it had net income of $128.7
million, or $5.01 a share, in the three months ended June 30,
compared with $92.1 million, or $3.77 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 4 percent to $740 million from $714 million. The 1987
figures included $19.3 million income from discontinued operations.
   For the first six months of the year, CBS earned $1.04 billion,
or $40.43 a share, up sevenfold from $140.8 million, or $5.70 a
share, a year earlier. Revenue was unchanged at $1.44 billion.
   The latest results included a gain of $866.6 million on asset
sales, while the 1987 figures include $60.2 million income from
discontinued operations.

   Gillette Co. shareholders may get another chance
to vote in the battle between the personal care products company
and the dissident investor group attempting to win seats on its
board of directors.
   A federal judge who ruled that Gillette inaccurately portrayed
the group, Coniston Partners, during a bitter proxy battle said
Wednesday he was likely to order a new shareholder vote.
   U.S. District Judge Mark L. Wolf ruled last week that Gillette
inaccurately portrayed Coniston in newspaper advertisements leading
up to the April 21 proxy vote in which shareholders rejected a
Coniston slate of four director candidates.
   Coniston had called for a new vote in briefs filed this week in
the second part of the case, being held to decide what sort of
relief Coniston deserves. Wolf tentatively set a second trial to
begin Aug 22.
   The judge said at a hearing Wednesday likely would invalidate
the proxy vote and call a new vote regardless of whether he found
that Coniston acted with ``unclean hands'' in the period leading up
to the election.
   ``I continue to believe some relief to shareholders will be
required,'' he said. ``What I found was that the essence of the
election was tainted in a material way.''
   Gillette stock closed at $40.50, up $2.25 a share on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   ``That's what we've been saying to him,'' Coniston attorney Mark
A. Michelson said of Wolf's statement. ``What the judge is saying
is he's inclined to give the relief we want, which is a new
election.''
   But Gillette spokesman David Fausch said Wolf was only
speculating on what action he may take. ``He's made no decision on
that,'' Fausch said of a new vote. ``He said that he's evolving his
theories and ideas but no decision has been made at all on remedy.''
   After a seven-day trial, Wolf ruled July 6 that several Gillette
newspaper ads during the proxy solicitation contained ``falsely
misleading'' information about Coniston. But he ruled Gillette did
not mislead shareholders when it withheld information about
potential buyers during the three-month proxy battle.
   Wolf also said he was still reviewing whether Coniston violated
full disclosure laws in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
filings, including the role of Swiss financier Tito Tettamanti, who
raised $5 million for strategic block investments in Gillette.
   On Wednesday, Wolf said the second phase of the case may require
more information on Tettamanti.
   ``Although he is beyond the subpoena powers of this court,
perhaps he should be invited to come,'' Wolf said. ``Why doesn't he
make one of his visits in the last week of August and we'll ask him
questions and watch the answers.''
   Gillette on April 14 filed suit seeking to block Coniston's
proxy bid on the grounds Coniston falsified SEC filings and did not
fully disclose all investors, including Tettamanti.
   A countersuit filed by Coniston five days later alleged Gillette
misprepresented Coniston in advertisements and mailings to the
company's 27,000 shareholders and failed to publicly disclose all
companies that had expressed interest in buying Gillette.
   Stockholders rejected the Coniston slate of candidates by 52
percent to 48 percent.
   Coniston controls 6.76 million Gillette shares, or about 5.8
percent of the shares outstanding. Coniston is attempting to
pressure the 12-member Gillette board to sell the company, which
likely would boost the value of the group's shares.

<HEAD>Hewlett Countersues Apple Inc. In Copyright Battle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hewlett-Packard Co. is claiming that
Apple Computer Inc. does not hold valid copyrights for visual
displays and computer images that are at the center of a legal
battle between the computer makers.
   In a countersuit filed Wednesday in response to a U.S. District
Court copyright infringement suit filed by Apple, Hewlett-Packard
alleged that Apple was engaged in unfair business practices and
antitrust violations.
   Palo Alto-based Hewlett Packard denied all of Apple's suit
allegations and asked the court to invalidate Apple's copyrights in
the case and to dismiss its suit against Hewlett-Packard.
   Cupertino-based Apple sued Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft Corp.,
of Redmond, Wash., in March, charging them with copyright
infringement in two so-called ``operating environment'' programs _
Microsoft's Windows and Hewlett-Packard's NewWave.
   The programs provide a visual ``desktop'' on the screen, on
which a computer user can view various symbols representing
documents, applications programs and places to store information.
   In April, Microsoft submitted a response to the court in San
Jose, charging that Apple violated contracts, acted in bad faith
and damaged Microsoft's relations with other companies.
   Microsoft denied that Windows infringed on Apple copyrights by
using images that too closely resembled those of Apple's popular
Macintosh computer.
   Apple's suit shook software developers and computer makers
throughout the industry because of its potential scope. Aside from
Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft, Apple also indirectly challenged its
biggest rival, International Business Machines Corp., which has
been incorporating display graphics similar to Apple's.
   Apple was seen as essentially asking the court to preserve a
technological edge it has enjoyed over its competitors, just as the
rivals were closing the gap.
   ``HP is confident the court will agree Apple's suit has no
merit,'' said Douglas C. Chance, executive vice president of HP's
Business Systems Sector.
   Apple officials could not be reached for comment Wednesday.

   Here are sales results for the seven major U.S.
automakers for July 1-10.
   Percentage changes are based on average daily sales during each
period rather than comparisons of straight totals. There were seven
selling days in the period this year and eight last year.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota and Mazda are counted as domestic and appear in this table.
   Volkswagen, which ceases production Thursday at its
Westmoreland, Pa., plant, stopped reporting U.S. made cars
separately from its German imports. Sales of imported cars and
trucks are reported at the end of each month.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and
Chrysler names are counted as foreign.

   Car sales weakened but stronger light truck
buying topped period sales records for some manufacturers in early
July.
   Jeep vehicles and Ford light trucks roared to new sales peaks,
makers said in reporting sales figures Wednesday for the July 1-10
period.
   Industrywide, domestic light truck sales climbed 8.6 percent on
a daily average, compared with overall 1.6 percent decline in daily
sales of U.S. made cars.
   Combined car and light truck sales totaled 228,870 for the seven
sales days in the July 1-10 period, and combined sales were up 2
percent on a daily basis from the comparable 1987 period, which
contained eight days.
   Chrysler Corp. sold 21,700 cars in the early July period, for a
12.2 percent increase in daily sales. But General Motors Corp.'s
sales of 66,737 cars and Ford Motor Co.'s sales of 41,436 vehicles
both represented 5.8 percent declines.
   David Healy, automotive analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., said the slowed sales did not represent a significant change.
``I think sales are just bouncing around, reflecting the timing of
incentives,'' he said.
   General Motors and Ford recently cut back on buyer incentives.
Chrysler had said its current campaign would expire Tuesday, then
announced a new, slightly smaller package that day.
   ``There may have been some people in there buying because they
thought the incentives were about to end,'' said Chrysler spokesman
Tom Houston.
   Ray Windecker, an analyst at Ford, said the timing of incentives
pushed Ford's car sales up in late June with a resulting early July
fallback.
   But car sales may continue tapering off, because makers are not
oversupplied and will have no reason to offer the ``fire sale''
style incentives of August and September of 1986 and 1987, said
Chris Cedergren, analyst at J.D. Power & Associates in Agoura
Hills, Calif.
   In contrast, Ford's sales of 30,869 light trucks, an average of
4,410 a day, broke a July 1-10 record rate of 4,312, set in 1973
when a dealer incentive program concluded on July 10, Windecker
said.
   And Chrysler said sales of 5,110 Jeep vehicles surpassed the
4,944 units of the best previous July 1-10 period for Jeeps, in
1986.
   Among foreign companies making cars domestically, Honda Motor
Co. led with sales of 9,715 U.S.-made cars, an 18.1 percent surge
in daily sales from a year earlier.
   Daily sales fell by 2.7 percent at Nissan Motor Corp., which
sold 1,412 U.S. made cars during the period. Toyota Motor Corp.
sold 829 U.S.-produced cars, up from 665 in the year earlier period.
   Volkswagen of America, ceasing production today at its
Westmoreland, Pa., plant, stopped reporting domestically produced
autos separately from its German imports. Imported car sales are
reported at the end of each month.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed In Calm Trading, Gold Prices Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was mixed in calm European trading late
this morning as activity wound down ahead of Friday's release of
U.S. trade figures. Gold prices were slightly higher.
   Dealers said the market appeared to have stabilized in a narrow
range after recording further gains on statements made Wednesday by
U.S. Federal Reserve Board officials.
   Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated a tighter monetary policy and
Federal Reserve Board member Wayne Angell said the dollar's rise
was underpinned by fundamental factors.
   Dealers said the U.S. trade figures for May will be the key to
the dollar's trading range over the next week.
   The market is expecting a seasonally adjusted trade deficit
between $10 billion and $11.5 billion, larger than $9.9 billion in
April, said a dealer at a large West German bank.
   A trader in Rome said if the deficit is below $11 billion, the
dollar is likely to rise, but if it is higher, the dollar may
suffer a serious setback.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday's
rates, included: 1.8479 West German marks, up from 1.8460; 1.5305
Swiss francs, down from 1.5313; 6.2260 French francs, down from
6.2265; 2.0843 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0835; 1,369.75 Italian
lire, up from 1,367.75; and 1.2077 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2083.
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.6870 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.6920 late Wednesday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.48 yen to close at 132.95 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted lower at 132.055 yen.
   Bullion dealers said gold came off its early morning highs in
quiet trading while silver, which rose as high as $7.25 a troy
ounce earlier today, also retreated slightly.
   Silver was quoted in London late this morning at a bid price of
$7.24, up from late Wednesday's $6.98.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $439.50 a troy ounce,
and at midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $439.05. Both were higher than Wednesday's
late bid $437.25.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $439, up from $435.50 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.25 to close at a bid $440.53.

<HEAD>Stocks Rebound, Dollar Up Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices rebounded today on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, and the dollar gained slightly against the Japanese yen
before the release of U.S. trade figures for May.
   The dollar opened at 132.75 yen, the day's low, and rose to
132.97 yen before closing at 132.95 yen, up 0.48 yen from
Wednesday's close.
   Dealers said the dollar moved up marginally following remarks by
U.S. Federal Reserve Board member Wayne Angell that the board
should not attempt to reverse the dollar's recent upswing.
   But they said trading remained slow with a wait-and-see attitude
prevailing before the U.S. Commerce Department announces the May
trade figures on Friday.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 79.74-point
loser Wednesday, gained 63.98 points, or 0.23 percent, to close the
day's trading at 28,084.08.
   After opening higher, stock prices eased late in the morning
session but recovered on the buying of blue chip electricals and
automakers during the afternoon session.
   Traders said the market was dominated by speculative, short-term
trading ahead of the announcement of U.S. trade figures.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 2.1 billion shares,
up from Wednesday's 2.0 billion shares.

<HEAD>Japanese Officials Criticize U.S. Trade Bill</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Trade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese government and business leaders expressed
regret Thursday over the U.S. House of Representatives' passage of
a trade bill that they described as protectionist.
   Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno called the bill ``problematical,''
and said Japan strongly hoped the Reagan administration ``will
continue to oppose protectionism.''
   A Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Japan had ``serious concerns'' about the bill, and he hoped
the United States ``will stick to the rules'' governing
international trade.
   The government's chief spokesman, Keizo Obuchi, told a news
conference the passage of the bill was regrettable and expressed
hope Reagan will veto the legislation. The bill must still pass the
Senate.
   ``The government hopes the Reagan administration will fight
protectionism and that this protectionist bill will not be
enacted,'' Obuchi said.
   Joichi Aoi, president of Toshiba Corp., said the bill unfairly
singles out his company for a subsidiary's sale of high-technology
machine tools to the Soviet Union. The sale was made in violation
of the rules of the Coordinating Committee for Export Control, a
multilateral agreement regulating the flow of Western technology to
communist nations.
   U.S. officials have charged that the machine tools, sold by
Toshiba Machine Co., helped the Soviet Union build quieter
submarine propellers.
   ``Our position has been that any U.S. sanctions against a
foreign firm for violating COCOM regulations would be contrary to
the principle of COCOM, which holds that transgressors of the
export regulations must be punished under the laws of the
individual countries where the incidents occur,'' Aoi said.
   The Toshiba provision in the trade bill calls for barring
Toshiba Corp. from sales to the U.S. government for three years,
and prohibits Toshiba Machine Co. from all exports to the United
States for the same duration.
   Other Japanese business leaders also expressed regret over the
House action, saying it would have an adverse effect on Japan-U.S.
relations.
   Takashi Ishihara, president of the Japan Association of
Corporate Executives, called the vote short-sighted and untimely
because it came only a few days after the release of Japan's trade
figures for June, which showed a rapid decline in the country's
trade surplus with the United States.
   The Foreign Ministry official said the trade bill as drafted
does not violate regulations of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, an international trade body. But he said the bill
contains enough enforcement latitude to allow possible violation of
GATT rules in practice.

<HEAD>Japan Says Trade Figures with US Improving</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan said Thursday its trade figures with the
United States have improved dramatically in the past six months and
predicted the trend will continue for the rest of the year.
   Overall, the trade surplus with the United States was down 14.9
percent during the period from January through June, compared with
the same period last year, according to statistics from the Foreign
Ministry.
   Imports rose 40.8 percent in dollar terms, while exports were up
only 5.8 percent.
   Part of the improvement was attributable to a decline in the
value of the dollar, which makes imports in dollar terms seem
greater.
   In yen terms, imports were up 19.7 percent, while exports were
up 9.9 percent.
   In overall trade, imports were up 34.3 percent in dollar terms,
and exports were up 15.7 percent. The balance of trade
internationally declined by 15.9 percent.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman, who demanded anonymity, said he
was pleased with the latest figures and said Japan was working hard
to solve international trade problems.
   He said Japan in the first half of this year had made
significant progress in resolving thorny trade issues such as beef
and citrus quotas with the United States, a new science and
technology agreement with Washington and an agreement to open its
construction industry to foreign competition.
   According to the trade figures, imports of wood products from
the United States were up a sharp 52 percent, foodstuff imports
were up 34 percent, and machinery imports were up 58 percent.
   The official said he expected these trends to continue, but said
``we can't be too complacent.'' He said two-way trade cannot always
be free from friction, but he said Japan ``has shown to the world
it is capable of dealing with these issues.''

<TEXT>
   Britain's unemployment rate fell to a seasonally
adjusted 8.4 percent in June from 8.6 percent in the previous
month, while industrial production rose 0.6 percent in May, the
government said Thursday.
   The unemployment rate also was down from 10.4 percent in June
1987, the Department of Employment said.
   However, the department said half the decline in the latest
month was the result of a new definition of employment. People
employed by government job training programs now are being counted
as employed.
   The new practice brings Britain more in line with other European
countries' methods of defining employment and adds about 334,000
persons to the ranks of the employed, the department said.
   Total seasonally adjusted British unemployment came to 2.38
million people in June, down from a revised 2.41 million people in
May and 2.92 million people in June 1987, the department said.
   Meanwhile, industrial production was up 3.8 percent from a year
earlier, according to the Central Statistical Office.
   The latest figures compare with April's revised 1 percent
month-to-month rise and 4 percent year-to-year rise.
   The office said the index of industrial production, which uses a
1980 base of 100, rose to 116.7 in May from a revised 116 in April
and was up from 112.4 in May 1987.

<HEAD>Dealers Offering Samurai Insurance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ohio Suzuki dealers, in an attempt to restore
confidence in the company's sharply criticized Samurai model, are
offering a $1 million accidental life insurance policy free for one
year to people who buy or lease the vehicle.
   ``You can't run enough ads to erase the cloud that all of this
has put over the car,'' said Robert Reichert, president of the
Kenwood Dealer Group, on Wednesday. The sales promotion ends Aug.
31 but may be continued if buyers show renewed confidence in the
model, Reichert said.
   He said he worked with other Ohio Suzuki dealers on the plan.
``We decided that we needed something emphatic,'' he said.
   Charges by Consumers Union that the vehicle tips over too easily
caused national sales of the Samurai to drop by 70.6 percent in
June.
   American Suzuki Motor Corp., which had been selling about 6,000
a month of the vehicles from March through May, reported it sold
2,199 Samurais in June, compared to 7,479 in June 1987.
   Reichert said Suzuki dealers have considerable data to dispute
the information put out by Consumers Union, which publishes
Consumer Reports magazine. Consumers Union says Suzuki should
recall the vehicle and give car owners refunds.
   ``We felt there was very little we could do to effectively fight
the negative publicity'' other than offer a bigpromotion to show
that the Samurai is safe, Reichert said.
   The insurance program, which starts Friday, is being
underwritten by the American International group of insurance
companies.
   In a separate move, American Suzuki officials on Wednesday
disclosed to dealers plans to offer a $2,000 discount off the
Samurai's regular price for a limited time.
   Reichert said the dealers offer the insurance policy for one
year but buyers can renew after that time and pay for it themselves.
   ``It's a typical accident policy,'' said Reichert. If a person
is killed when a Samarai turns over or tips over, the policy will
pay $1 million.''
   ``But we're going to tell tham that these things are not built
to turn corners at 80 mph. Like any other car, these things can
turn over,'' Reichert said.
   Reichert said the Aug. 31 limitation was set to comply with Ohio
law that limits the time of sales promotions.

   Stock prices were little changed today as the
market absorbed the news of increases in the prime lending rate.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up .36 to 2,104.73
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers held a narrow edge on gainers in the overall count of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 410 up, 424 down and 517
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 24.49 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Three large money-center banks in New York and Chicago raised
their prime lending rates today from 9 to 9.5 percent.
   Analysts said, however, that those moves were seen largely as a
response to recent increases in open-market money rates and did not
necessarily have much predictive value for the future course of
rates in general.
   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said
Wednesday that further increases in rates were not inevitable.
   In any case, brokers said traders were reluctant to commit
themselves extensively either way in advance of Friday's report
from the Commerce Department on the nation's trade balance for May.
   Millipore climbed 1{ to 38} and Worthington Industries, traded
in the over-the-counter market, gained 1{ to 24}. The two stocks
were added to Standard & Poor's 500-stock composite index,
prompting buying by index funds set up to duplicate the performance
of the 500.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dipped .01 to 152.26. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .09 at 307.57.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 11.73 to
2,104.37.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 6 on the
NYSE, with 771 up, 663 down and 512 unchanged. Big Board volume
came to 218.93 million shares, against 161.65 million in the
previous session.

   A pair of government contractors billed the
Army for 23 hours of work at the Redstone Arsenal in Alabama even
though the job they performed took only 45 minutes, says a
congressional watchdog agency.
   And in another incident at Redstone, the contractors billed the
Pentagon for the work of 10 men to paint stripes on a parking lot
even though two of them did all the painting while the other eight
stood around, the General Accounting Office said.
   The idle workers were often told to hide from government
inspectors, a GAO witness told a house subcommittee on Wednesday.
   The incidents are part of an investigation in which the FBI and
the Army's Criminal Investigative Division are probing contracts at
the Huntsville installation, the GAO said.
   The Redstone investigations are unrelated to the investigation
into allegations that defense contractors and their consultants
bribed Pentagon officials for inside information that could have
been vital in bidding for contracts worth billions of dollars. No
charges have been filed.
   The Redstone case was revealed by David C. Williams of the GAO's
office of special investigations. He was testifying before the
Government Operations national security subcommittee.
   The Redstone case in which the 45-minute job was inflated and
the parking lot was painted involves a five-year, $250 million
contract for base support activities, including maintenance, food
service and equipment repair, Williams said.
   The contract was between the Army Missile Command and two
contractors who formed a joint venture to bid on the project. They
are the Holmes and Narver Corp. of Orange, Calif., and the
Morrison-Knudsen Corp. of Boise, Idaho.
   The investigation showed that ``to cover for falsified labor
charges, materials had to be expended and building supplies were
given away to contract workers and government employees,'' Williams
said.
   ``Materials such as paint were discarded in dumpsters and, and
other times, thrown into the Tennessee River,'' Williams.
   A review of vehicle maintenance records, looking only at oil
changes and lube jobs, showed that ``the government was overcharged
by 262 percent, or 5,000 hours, each year,'' he said.
   ``This type of charge attempted to justify the excessive costs
for that year, and created an inflated cost history for future
projected increases in the contract,'' he explained. ``In fact, the
five-year contract has increased over its original bid by more than
$100 million.''
   Officials at the Army base at Huntsville and Holmes and Narver
did not return telephoned requests for reaction to Williams'
statements.
   Vern Nelson, a spokesman for Morrison-Knudsen, said, ``We are
aware the General Accounting Office has been auditing these
operations, and we have been fully cooperating with the GAO
representatives. We have just received the GAO congressional
testimony and are reviewing the matter.''
   Williams also said that a 1987 study of 263 time-and-material
contracts to small businesses turned up some suspicious facts.
   For example, he said, 45 percent of those 263 contracts showed
that the bids were ``within 1 percent of the government's cost
estimates, suggesting that there might have been unauthorized
releases of government estimates, or that contractors themselves
prepared the government's cost estimates. Either practice
compromises the government's ability to ensure a fair and
reasonable price.''
   In yet another case, said Williams, there was ``apparent
favoritism in two contract awards'' by Army Lt. Gen. John Wall,
commander of the Army Strategic Defense Command, toward BDM
International Inc. of McLean, Va.
   In one case, Wall directed BDM to be interim contractor for a
major research initiative. In another case, according to Williams,
BDM lost out to Teledyne Brown Engineering on a $500 million
contract, but Wall ordered that 240,000 hours of support work be
shifted from Teledyne to BDM.
   Since BDM charges $15 per hour more than Teledyne, Williams
said, ``this could result in an expected increase in cost of
approximately $3.6 million.''
   Wall was investigated by the Army CID and retired in June,
Williams said. Attempts to locate him for comment were not
successful.
   James Hughes, a spokesman for BDM, said ``there was no
suggestion of wrongdoing on the part of BDM'' in the Army
investigation.

<HEAD>Retail Sales Up 0.5 Percent</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Grafs 1-4 new to UPDATE with prime rate hikes; uppicks 2nd
graf pvs: The Commerce ...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Several of the nation's major banks raised their prime lending
rate today by half a percentage point to 9.5 percent, the highest
level in more than two years.
   It was the second boost in the key lending rate this year and
signaled a new round of higher interest rates for consumers on
loans for purchases ranging from automobiles to homes.
   The increase came one day after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan warned he would use the central bank's power to tighten
credit if inflation started to accelerate.
   Separately, American consumers boosted retail sales 0.5 percent
in June by purchasing more cars and summer gear, the government
reported today, but the increase wasn't as strong as expected and
could ease concerns about inflation.
   The Commerce Department said sales increased $713 million last
month to a seasonally adjusted, but not inflation-adjusted, $132.8
billion. Much of the increase came from sales of autos, air
conditioners, barbecues and clothes.
   Analysts had been expecting a gain of about 0.8 percent. The
moderate June increase therefore may dampen anxiety in financial
markets that the economy is too strong, lessening pressure on the
Federal Reserve to tighten credit.
   The retail sales report came a day after Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan warned he would use higher interest rates to battle any
resurgence of inflation.
   Currency investors interpreted Greenspan's comments as
supportive of the dollar, which finished mostly higher despite
reports of central bank intervention. But the stock market
discounted his warnings and the bond market was mixed.
   Delivering his midyear report to Congress on monetary policy,
Greenspan also said the Fed and other central banks would continue
to work for stable exchange rates. He said he saw no evidence that
the growth of U.S. exports has been affected by the dollar's recent
rise against other major currencies.
   Greenspan said the central bank stands ready to push interest
rates higher to stem inflation. And the risks of a new wage-price
spiral are ``sufficiently great'' that the Fed should err on the
side of squeezing credit, rather than stimulating the economy, he
said.
   Greenspan said the Fed already has made a series of small
credit-tightening steps from late March through late June, allowing
short-term interest rates to rise.
   Nevertheless, inflationary pressures _ including tight labor
markets, high factory operating rates and drought-caused increases
in grain prices _ remain and must be curbed now rather than later,
he said.
   Greenspan's pledge to continue fighting inflation gave bond
prices an early boost, but they finished mixed.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down
about 10 points at its afternoon low, closed with an 11.73 point
gain at 2,104.37. The late round of buying was attributed by
analysts to computer program trading.
   Grain and soybean futures closed sharply higher on the Chicago
Board of Trade, with most contracts up their allowable limit in
reaction to Tuesday's government report showing severe drought
damage to crops.
   Crude oil prices skidded to a 21-month low as traders grew more
pessimistic about overproduction by OPEC members. On the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the August-delivery price of West Texas
Intermediate crude fell 28 cents to close at $14.44 a barrel.
   In other economic developments Wednesday:
   _Automakers reported that buyers reacting to changing incentive
offerings pushed domestic car sales down at General Motors Corp.
and Ford Motor Co. but up at No. 3 Chrysler Corp.
   _The House passed a revamped version of the massive trade bill,
now tailored to conditions set by President Reagan when he vetoed
the original in May.
   _The U.S. appetite for foreign oil increased sharply in the
first half of the year, while domestic crude production kept
declining, an industry report showed.

<TEXT>
   The Chicago Board Options Exchange, smarting
from a 50 percent downturn in options trading since the Oct. 19
stock market collapse, is trying to persuade brokers and investors
to return to the market.
   The market is dispatching teams to 30 cities to contact brokers,
explain what happened and promote stock options sales to put a
floor under losses for potential investors.
   ``We're trying to rebuild the business,'' said James Emerson, a
marketing consultant with the exchange who will travel to San
Antonio, Memphis and New Orleans next week.
   After a five-year bull market when confidence in the financial
markets blossomed to an all-time high, individual investors were
badly shaken by the October debacle and have been slow to return.
   Shortly after Oct. 19, options trading volume on the Chicago
Board Options Exchange fell by 50 percent, Emerson said. Trading
has slowly improved, but has yet to approach pre-October levels, he
said.
   Individual investors make up about 75 percent of the exchange's
clientele. Its recovery has been somewhat slower than the
institution-driven stock market.
   Emerson says the Chicago Board Options Exchange, which accounts
for 55 percent of all listed options traded in the United States,
has slashed staff, ``cutting the fat down to the muscle.''
   The most noticeable change is that consumers are less eager to
enter the risky business of call and put options.
   A call option is the right to buy 100 shares of a security,
based on the expectation that a stock will rise in price. A put
option is the right to sell 100 shares of a security on the
expectation that the stock's price will fall.
   To counter consumer fears, Emerson suggests that brokerages use
options to reduce risk and make a portfolio more conservative.
   For instance, an investor might buy a certain company's stock,
then purchase put options on that same stock. The strategy puts a
floor on losses regardless of whether the stock price rises or
falls.
   ``We're not presenting anything that's brand new,'' Emerson
said. But by reminding brokers about the advantages of options
trading, he hopes many of them will start calling clients again.

Hurt Bush</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A veto of a bill to require that workers be
given advance notice of plant closings and layoffs would be a
pro-jobs move and not hurt Vice President George Bush's
presidential campaign, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
today.
   ``The senior advisers recommend a veto, and it was a major
reason why (President Reagan) vetoed the trade bill,'' Fitzwater
said aboard Air Force One as Reagan flew to Marion, Ill., to visit
a drought-striken farm. He was later flying to Davenport, Iowa.
   Fifty-four of the 177 House Republicans abandoned the
administration and Bush on the issue Wednesday. Nineteen of the
Senate's 46 Republicans did the same last week as Congress heads
for a showdown with Reagan over the issue.
   ``We support the concept but believe it ought to be a part of
labor-management agreements,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``We believe this bill stymies job creation, puts structural
rigidities in the market to make it more difficult to expand plant
capacity and create more employment, so we consider our position on
plant closings as a pro-jobs position,'' he said.
   Fitzwater denied that a veto of the measure, which had earlier
been included in a trade bill Reagan vetoed, would prove
politically damaging to Bush.
   On a 286-136 vote, more than the two-thirds needed to enact the
law over a veto from Reagan, the House voted Wednesday to let
workers caught up in plant closings or layoffs involving more than
50 of them know about it 60 days beforehand.
   The Senate approved the same measure a week ago by a veto-proof
72-23 vote in the biggest legislative battle of the decade between
corporate America and labor unions.
   House Republicans aware of polls showing that more than 80
percent of the American public favor the notices are distancing
themselves from Reagan and Bush on the issue.
   ``I don't think he'll be able to sustain a veto,'' said Rep.
Marge Roukema, R-N.J., who led the House fight against the
mandatory notices through the legislative process but voted for the
bill Wednesday.
   ``There are a lot more than 54 Republicans who don't want him to
veto it,'' she said. ``We fought every fight ... but you have to
pick your battles. Bush is going to have to handle the issue now.''
   Immediately after the vote on the layoff notices Wednesday, the
House approved by an even larger 376-45 vote a trade bill that
President Reagan vetoed in May because the plant closing and layoff
notices were then a part of it.
   The 14.1 million-member AFL-CIO, possessing one-sixth of the
delegates at next week's Democratic National Convention, has
threatened to withdraw its pivotal support for overhauling the
nation's trade laws if the plant closing notices are not enacted
separately.
   And the labor movement's chief supporters in the Senate _ Edward
M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, _ have vowed to
reattach the notices to the trade legislation or kill the bill
entirely if Reagan's veto of them as a separate measure is upheld.
   ``Today's House vote, coupled with last week's overwhelming
Senate margin, clearly give the White House a strong message that
this bill should be signed,'' AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said
Wednesday.
   In vetoing the trade bill in May, Reagan echoed the sentiments
of business groups such as the National Association of
Manufacturers, U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business
Roundtable, which oppose notices of plant closings or impending
layoffs. Reagan called them anti-competitive and said they would
stifle the creation of new jobs.
   Under the Constitution, Reagan has 10 days _ excluding Sundays _
to veto the measure after it reaches his desk, which House leaders
said will be sometime next week. That gives Democrats time for a
veto override vote before the Republican National Convention the
second week of August.
   ``I suspect the president will veto it,'' House Minority Leader
Robert Michel, R-Ill., said Wednesday. ``The legislation is here to
create an issue, not because people are demanding it.''
   Bush has steadfastly supported Reagan's position that companies
should tell workers well in advance they are about to lose their
jobs, but that the government shouldn't make them do it.
   Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis said Wednesday
he will sign the bill into law the first month of his presidency if
elected in November.
   ``There is now a national consensus for national plant closing
legislation,'' Dukakis said in a statement also attacking Reagan's
handling of so-far unsuccessful efforts to oust Panamanian leader
Manuel Noriega after his indictment by a U.S. grand jury on drug
smuggling charges.
   ``An administration that is willing to give General Noriega 120
days notice certainly ought to be willing to give hard-working,
honest American workers and their families at least half that time
when they lose their job,'' Dukakis said.
   White House officials have said that Reagan himself has not
stated definitely that he would veto the notices. Business groups,
however, said Wednesday they are still counting on him for a veto.
   ``If he vetoed the trade bill because of it, I don't know why he
would turn around now,'' said Renee Reymond, the National
Association of Manufacturers' chief lobbyist on the issue. ``This
isn't over yet. I think some Republicans will come back with us.''
   Mark De Bernardo, the Chamber of Commerce's chief labor
lobbyist, said opponents remain within ``striking distance'' of
sustaining a veto.
   ``We recognize that the agenda of organized labor is much more
ambitious,'' De Bernardo said. ``The chamber will continue to
support the administration as it supports the business community
against this ill-advised measure.''

   Stock prices held steady today as the market
absorbed the news of increases in the prime lending rate.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up .54 to 2,104.91
by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers and losers ran about even in the overall count of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 556 up, 552 down and 550
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 53.82 million shares at
midmorning.
   Several money-center banks across the country raised their prime
lending rates today from 9 to 9.5 percent.
   Analysts said, however, that those moves were seen largely as a
response to recent increases in open-market money rates and did not
necessarily have much predictive value for the future course of
rates in general.
   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said
Wednesday that further increases in rates were not inevitable.
   In any case, brokers said traders were reluctant to commit
themselves extensively either way in advance of Friday's report
from the Commerce Department on the nation's trade balance for May.
   Millipore climbed 1| to 38~ and Worthington Industries, traded
in the over-the-counter market, gained ~ to 24[. The two stocks
were added to Standard & Poor's 500-stock composite index,
prompting buying by index funds set up to duplicate the performance
of the 500.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.02 to 152.29. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .23 at 307.43.

   Futures prices for corn, oats and soybeans
skyrocketed their allowable limits at the opening of today's
session on the Chicago Board of Trade in response to forecasts for
another month of drought in the Farm Belt.
   The National Weather Service predicted above-normal temperatures
and below-normal rainfall for most growing areas in both its
6-to-10 day and 30-day forecasts.
   ``Everyone's looking at the severe weather situation and right
now they're hard pressed to see anything that will turn it
around,'' said Mario Balletto, soybean analyst with Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets in New York.
   Rain is badly needed to salvage the shrinking percentage of the
corn crop that has not already been irreparably damaged by the
drought, and to prevent substantial soybean losses as that crop
enters its flowering and pod-forming stage, Balletto said.
   Corn, oat and soybean futures closed limit-up on Wednesday,
prompting the Board of Trade to expand the daily price limits by 50
percent, to 15 cents a bushel for corn and oats and 45 cents a
bushel for soybeans. Limits have been removed on the contracts for
delivery in July, pending the expiration of those contracts next
Wednesday.
   In early trading, wheat was 13 cents to 14 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $4.06 a bushel; corn was 11 cents
to 15 cents higher with July at $3.44{ a bushel; oats were 15 cents
to 15{ cents higher with July at $3.20 a bushel; soybeans were 45
cents to 45{ cents higher with July at $9.94 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were sharply lower while pork futures were mostly
higher in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to 1.02 cents lower with August at
63.30 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to 1.12 cents
lower with August at 73.15 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent lower
to the limit 1.50 cents higher with July at 45.20 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .90 cent to 1.63 cent higher with July at
34.60 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures closed sharply lower Thursday while pork futures
were mixed.

<HEAD>Unisys Is Investigated Over Billing For Army</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unisys Corp., which is being investigated
for allegedly fraudulent defense procurement practices, confirmed
today it may face charges for its billing for computer work done
for the U.S. Army.
   In a statement, the company said it ``has been cooperating with
the Office of the U.S. Attorney in Tucson, Ariz., in its
investigation of a contract with the Army Communications Center
based in Fort Huachuca.''
   A story in the Wall Street Journal Wednesday said the U.S.
Attorney's Office in Tucson planned to seek criminal charges
against a Unisys unit and two company officials.
   The overcharges in computer could reach as much as $10 million,
the Journal said. They stem from several years of work on the Army
Information Systems Command in Fort Huachuca, Ariz.
   However, Wren Timberlake, a spokesman at the Arizona base, said
the entire contract in question was for $9.2 million.
   Unisys said it totaled $8 million, and that the alleged
overcharges did not exceed $250,000. The company said the contract
with the Army was entered into in 1982 by Sperry Corp., which
merged with Burroughs Corp. in 1986 and became Unisys.
   ``If there were overcharges, they were significantly less than
$10 million,'' Timberlake said.
   ``I'm not certain the alleged charges involved any money at all.
The alleged administrative shortcoming involved in this case was
more the procedural irregularities in the way the government was
billed,'' he said.
   The Journal reported that Unisys had ``voluntarily disclosed the
problems at Fort Huachuca, provided additional information to the
Justice Department as the investigation progressed and pledged to
take corrective action to prevent recurrence.''
   The company has three contracts with the Army at Fort Huachuca,
totaling $70 million, Timberlake said, adding that the Army and
Unisys continue to have a ``fine relationship.''
   Unisys had $9.7 billion in revenues last year, of which 25
percent, or $2.4 billion, came from defense work.

   Stock prices hovered in a narrow range today as
the market absorbed the news of increases in the prime lending rate.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up .54 to 2,104.91
by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers slightly outnumbered in the overall count of New York
Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 651 up, 676 down and 557
unchanged.
   Many large banks across the country raised their prime lending
rates today from 9 to 9.5 percent.
   Analysts said, however, that those moves were seen largely as a
response to recent increases in open-market money rates and did not
necessarily have much predictive value for the future course of
rates in general.

Wednesday that further increases in rates were not inevitable.
   In any case, brokers said traders were reluctant to commit
themselves extensively either way in advance of Friday's report

   Millipore climbed 1| to 38~ and Worthington Industries, traded

<HEAD>Italy Loses `Pasta Purity' Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italy's ``pasta purity'' law was overturned
Thursday, opening the door to imports from other European countries
and touching off warnings of an invasion of mushy macaroni.
   The European Economic Community's Court of Justice in Luxembourg
ruled Italy could not ban imports under its 1967 law requiring that
all pasta be made with durum wheat.
   Pasta made of durum wheat is more firm _ but also more expensive
_ than macaroni made from other kinds of wheat.
   ``In the coming weeks, Italians will have to say good-bye to
their beloved firm pasta,'' said the left-leaning newspaper La
Repubblica, in an article headlined ``Pasta Without Durum Will Soon
Invade Italy if the EEC Has Its Way.''
   ``That flavorful and firm macaroni, the product of our able
pasta makers, will be challenged, and maybe even replaced, by the
gluey and insipid pasta from Germany or Holland,'' the newspaper
said.
   Even with the current emphasis on eating less, Italians consume
an average of 55 pounds a year each. It is always cooked ``al
dente,'' or firm.
   The case, dubbed ``Pasta Wars'' by the Italian press, was
brought to the court by the West German pasta producer Drei
Glocken. The firm was blocked in 1985 from importing pasta made
with mixed wheat into Italy.
   According to the ruling, Italy can still require its own pasta
makers to use only durum wheat, but it cannot use the law to block
pasta imports from the other 11 nations in the EEC
   The decision was based in part on a March 1987 ruling by the
Court of Justice that West Germany's beer purity law violated the
EEC's free trade rules by keeping out cheaper foreign beers.

   GAF Corp. and its vice chairman pleaded innocent
Thursday to charges they manipulated Union Carbide Corp.'s stock
price after a takeover attempt of the much larger company fizzled
in 1986.
   During a brief proceeding in federal court, lawyers for GAF and
James Sherwin entered the pleas to the 10-count indictment returned
last week by a grand jury.
   Sherwin, who could face a 50-year prison term and $15 million in
fines if convicted, was released without bail. U.S. District Judge
Mary Johnson Lowe, who was assigned the case, did not immediately
set a trial date.
   The indictment marked the first criminal charges against an
American industrial enterprise stemming indirectly from revelations
of Ivan Boesky, the Wall Street felon at the center of the
widespread insider trading scandal. Boesky is serving a three-year
prison term and cooperating with government investigators.
   According to the indictment, GAF and Sherwin attempted to create
an artificial demand for Carbide stock after GAF's takeover attempt
on Carbide failed in October 1986.
   Their alleged motive was to induce other investors to buy
Carbide shares and thereby inflate the price, so GAF could sell its
10 percent stake at a better profit or with minimal loss.
   If convicted on all counts, GAF could face $15 million in fines.
   Based in Wayne, N.J., GAF is a major producer of chemicals and
building materials.

   Atlanta again ranked first in a survey of the
nation's top-level executives about the best place to locate a
business among the major U.S. cities.
   The Louis Harris & Associates survey, released Thursday, asked
chief executive officers to give their opinion of general business
conditions in the nation's 31 largest metropolitan areas.
   Of the 385 executives responding, 39 percent rated the Atlanta
area as excellent, giving the city the top ranking for the third
year in a row.
   San Diego got an excellent rating from 26 percent of the
executives, taking second place. The other cities in the top five
were Boston with 21 percent and Chicago and Dallas-Fort Worth with
20 percent each.
   Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young said favorable living costs and the
availability of a skilled work force have helped make the city
attractive to businesses. ``These are things we have strongly
emphasized,'' he said.
   Harris was commissioned to conduct the survey by Cushman &
Wakefield, a New York-based real estate brokerage firm.
   Also ranked in the survey were:
   _Los Angeles, 19 percent.
   _Washington, D.C., 19 percent.
   _Phoenix, Ariz., 18 percent.

<TEXT>
   Share prices finished lower in choppy trading
Thursday on the London Stock Exchange, after being whipsawed by
British economic reports and by news that major U.S. banks raised
their prime lending rates to 9.5 percent from 9 percent.
   However, market players were reluctant to significantly change
their positions ahead of Friday's barrage of U.S. economic
indicators, dealers said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished the
day down 8 points, or 0.4 percent, at 1,863.3, its lowest level of
the day.
   Trading volume was a relatively robust 526.6 million shares, up
from Wednesday's 430.8 million shares.
   The U.S. trade report for May, producer prices for June,
industrial production data for June and business inventories for
May are due to be released Friday by the government in Washington.
In addition, the British retail price index for June is to be
reported.
   ``We've been up and down like a yo-yo today,'' one London equity
salesman said. He said the market had been doing quite well on the
spate of British economic reports released early Thursday until the
prime rate hikes at midafternoon ``knocked us down like a ton of
bricks.''
   Of particular interest to the London market was news that the
underlying annual rate of increase in British average earnings held
steady at 8.5 percent in May, following a downward revision in
April to 8.5 percent from 8.75 percent.
   That report helped eased fears about inflation, but the market
quickly became unsettled by the prime rate increase, analysts said.

<TEXT>
   Forecasts for another month of drought conditions
in the Midwest drove prices for most corn, oat and soybean futures
up their allowable limits Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   But profit-taking cooled the advance in prices for near-term
delivery, and wheat futures closed lower after failing to hold new
contract highs.
   All corn, oat and soybean contracts soared their respective
limits at the opening in response to the National Weather Service's
6-to-10-day and 30-day forecasts for above-normal temperatures and
below-normal rainfall in the Farm Belt.
   Most of those contracts held their limit gains through the
close. But the July contracts, on which the limits have been
removed pending their expiration next Wednesday, closed with
relatively modest gains.
   Analysts said the pattern indicated profit-taking, perhaps
stemming from increased chances of rain in the Midwest on Friday.
   Wheat settled 4 cents to 10 cents lower with July at $3.87 a
bushel; corn was 2 cents to 15 cents higher with July at $3.35{ a
bushel; oats were 3{ cents to 15 cents higher with July at $3.08 a
bushel; soybeans were 31{ cents to 45 cents higher with July at
$9.80 a bushel.

<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 443 money market mutual
funds rose $1.39 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The rise to $266.33 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday followed a revised increase of $567.5 million the
previous week, the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said.
That increase originally had been reported as $468.8 million.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $280.02 billion in the week
ended Feb. 24.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 220 general purpose funds rose $814.1 million to $82.65
billion, assets of 100 broker-dealer funds rose $725.2 million to
$114.17 billion, and assets of 123 institutional funds fell $147.1
million to $69.52 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 6.70 percent from 6.68 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 6.64 percent from 6.58 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
unchanged at 35 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and savings banks in
the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield
available on money market accounts rose to 5.77 percent as of
Wednesday from 5.76 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged at 5.12 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.21
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 7.15 the
previous week. Yields were 7.51 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 7.48
percent; 7.89 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 7.84 percent; and
8.28 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.26 percent.

   MCI Communications Corp. signaled confidence in
its future Thursday by announcing plans to repurchase for $677
million the 16.2 percent stake held by its largest shareholder,
International Business Machines Corp.
   But MCI defrayed the cost and kept a link to IBM by saying it
would sell IBM a new issue of $400 million in preferred shares. The
shares will give IBM 10 percent of the voting rights in MCI.
   Investors reacted positively to the announcement, bidding MCI up
75 cents to $16.12{ a share in over-the-counter trading, a 5
percent increase.
   MCI's stock has doubled from $8 a share a year ago and more than
tripled from its low of $5 a share in early 1987. The
second-biggest long-distance phone company was staggering then from
a bloody 1986 in which it lost $448 million.
   Investors have been impressed by Washington-based MCI's ability
to lure big-business accounts and 800-number service away from
American Telephone & Telegraph Co., the market leader. Also, the
multibillion-dollar cost of constructing a nationwide fiber network
is mostly complete.
   However, MCI's stock remains far below the peak of $28.50 a
share, adjusted for stock splits, that was reached in 1983. One
continuing worry is that MCI could suffer in price battles if AT&T
wins the freedom on price-setting it has been seeking.
   AT&T, unlike its competitors, requires governmental approval
before it can offer special low rates to certain customers to get
or keep their business.
   IBM's agreement to sell its common shares was not seen as a
split between it and MCI. For one thing, IBM will still have 10
percent of the voting rights through its non-tradable issue of
preferred shares. Also, the companies had not been tightly coupled
anyway, in spite of some cooperative marketing and development
projects, which will continue.
   ``At the time they bought it (the MCI stake), IBM looked at it
more as an insurance policy in case AT&T came up with something
that really integrated computers and communications in some sort of
unique, highly value-added way,'' said Charles Schelke, an analyst
for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   Instead, most companies have since decided it is not important
for computer makers to own transmission networks, or for
long-distance companies to own computer operations. AT&T, with big
commitments in both areas, is an exception.
   ``This indicates the confidence that the management and the
directors of MCI have in their future,'' said James M. McCabe, an
analyst for Nomura Securities International Inc.
   ``When they did the transaction, it helped MCI that they had a
big brother like IBM. In the ensuing period, MCI's fortunes have
changed for the better dramatically,'' McCabe said.
   IBM acquired its stake in MCI in March 1986 as part of its sale
to MCI of Satellite Business Systems, a long-distance
communications unit.
   MCI is paying less than the market price to repurchase its
stock. At the closing price of $15.37{ a share Wednesday in
over-the-counter trading, the roughly 47 million shares would have
cost more than $720 million.
   The deal was negotiated at a time when MCI's rapidly rising
stock was trading at a lower price, Daniel F. Akerson, MCI's chief
financial officer, said in an interview.
   IBM spokesman Michael Starks said the sale represented a gain
for IBM, which had been carrying the stock on its books at a value
of $528 million.

   Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.'s preferred
stock soared in heavy trading Thursday, when the first in a series
of ownership restrictions were lifted in a move that could bring
fresh capital to the savings and loan industry.
   In composite nationwide trading of issues listed on the New York
Stock Exchange, the shares jumped $32.75 a share to $132.75, the
first opportunity savings and loan institutions have had to boost
their holdings beyond 150,000 shares.
   Analysts have speculated the stock could trade as high as $200 a
share.
   The board of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., known as
Freddie Mac, approved a plan Wednesday to increase the number of
shares that savings institutions may own and to allow the public to
own shares beginning Jan. 1.
   Freddie Mac is a congressionally created entity that buys home
mortgages from savings insitutions and other lenders and packages
them into securities for resale to investors, thus making more
money available for home buyers.
   Freddie Mac voting stock is owned by the Federal Home Loan Bank
System, which, in turn, is owned by the nation's savings
institutions. Its perferred stock, which has no voting power, is
held now only by savings institutions.
   Under terms of the plan approved Wednesday, the limits on the
number of shares a single stockholder may own were immediately
lifted from 150,000 to 300,000. The limit will rise to 450,000 on
Oct. 1 and to 600,000 on Jan. 1.
   Savings institutions will be permitted until Nov. 30 to exchange
restricted shares for shares that public investors will be
permitted to buy after Jan. 1. The institutions will have to pay a
$7-a-share fee for the exchange.
   Freddie Mac has 15 million preferred shares outstanding.
Ownership restrictions on the 100,000 outstanding shares of voting
stock are unaffected and remain in place.
   Analysts said the stock is an attractive buy because of the
earning power behind it.
   ``As it trades, it will trade up in value, which means the value
of the holdings of the S&Ls that own stock will go up and boost
their capital positions, which is what they desperately need,''
said Charles Vincent, an analyst at Provident National Bank in
Philadelphia.
   In addition, Vincent noted that since Freddie Mac is a
government agency, there is virtually no risk in holding the shares.
   Vincent said the individual thrifts must choose whether to
``sell their shares to boost their capital position or hold on to
show an appreciation on their investment.''

consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 196.29 million shares.
   Many large banks across the country raised their prime lending
rates Thursday from 9 to 9.5 percent.
   Analysts said, however, that those moves were seen largely as a
response to recent increases in open-market money rates and did not
necessarily have much predictive value for the future course of
rates in general.
   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said
Wednesday that further increases in rates were not inevitable.
   In any case, brokers said traders were reluctant to commit
themselves extensively either way in advance of Friday's report
from the Commerce Department on the nation's trade balance for May.
   Most advance estimates on Wall Street call for an increase to
the $11 billion-$12 billion range in the trade deficit, from $9.9
billion reported for April. That would mark at least a temporary
interruption in the narrowing trend over the past several months.
   Motorola fell 1| to 50|. The company reported second-quarter
earnings of 93 cents a share, up from 62 cents in the comparable
period last year but below what some Wall Streeters had been
looking for.
   Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel rose 2 to 20~. On Wednesday the
company reported sharply higher earnings for the second quarter.
   Federal Home Loan Mortgage preferred shares posted the day's
biggest percentage gain, up 32} at 132}. The company's board voted
Wednesday to allow the public to invest in the stock, ownership of
which is now restricted to savings institutions.
   Millipore climbed 1] to 38| and Worthington Industries, traded
in the over-the-counter market, gained 1[ to 24]. The two stocks
were added to Standard & Poor's 500-stock composite index,
prompting buying by index funds set up to duplicate the performance
of the 500.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $7.64 billion, or 0.28
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.49 to 152.76.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 1.05 to 312.17, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was up .94 at 270.26.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
gained 1.11 to 394.67. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 308.14, up .48.

   The dollar rose in domestic dealings Thursday
despite concern over an upcoming report on the nation's trade
deficit.
   Gold prices fell in domestic trading after rising overseas.
Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid of $438.35 for
one troy ounce of gold, down from Wednesday's late bid of $440.25.
   The foreign exchange market largely ignored a hike in a key
lending rate by several U.S. commercial banks as the dollar settled
above the pscyhologically important barrier of 1.8500 West German
marks despite central bank intervention. The dollar had not closed
at these levels since last August.
   Traders said the market is focused primarily on the Commerce
Department's release on Friday of U.S. merchandise trade data for
May. Concern over the report also dominated the currency markets in
Europe, where the dollar finished mostly higher in light dealings.
   ``The market is still bullish (about the dollar) even if the
number does come in at $11.5 billion,'' said Cynthia Johnson, vice
president and foreign exchange manager at Lloyds Bank PLC's North
American office in New York.
   The trade deficit registered a narrow $9.9 billion in April, but
the consensus in the market is that a single-digit figure is
unlikely for May.
   Traders said the Federal Reserve stepped in when the dollar
reached 1.8500 West German marks in an attempt to stem its rise.
One trader said the U.S. central bank sold ``quite a substantial
amount'' of dollars during the intervention.
   A trader in Frankfurt predicted ``massive'' intervention by both
the West German and U.S. central banks in the event of a
lower-than-expected deficit, which would help push the dollar
higher.
   Several U.S. banks announced a half a percentage point increase
in the prime rate, putting the key lending rate at 9.5 percent, its
highest level in more than two years. But there was little reaction
in the market.
   ``The prime rate hike had been pretty much expected,'' said
Michael Malpede, a senior currency analyst at Refco Group in
Chicago. ``The timing may have been a bit unusual, but it is a
lagging indicator.''
   Generally, however, higher interest rates at home can be bullish
for the value of the dollar because they attract more foreign
investment to the United States.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.48 yen to a closing 132.95 Japanese yen.
Later in London, it edged up to 133.12 yen. In New York the dollar
finished at 133.18 yen, up from 132.69 yen on Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.6890 from $1.6920 late
Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.6875 to buy one pound, cheaper
than Wednesday's $1.6948.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday: 1.8507 West German marks, up from 1.8424; 1.5340 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5285; 6.2355 French francs, up from 6.2140;
1,370.38 Italian lire, up from 1,365.88, and 1.2095 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.2072.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday:
1.8475 West German marks, up from 1.8460; 1.5320 Swiss francs, up
from 1.5313; 6.2315 French francs, up from 6.2265; 2.0815 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.0835; 1,367.75 Italian lire, unchanged, and
1.2085 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2083.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, one troy ounce of gold fetched
$438.70, down from $440.40 on Wednesday.
   In London the metal rose to a late bid of $439 a troy ounce from
$437.25 late Wednesday. In Zurich, the bid was $441 an ounce, up
from $435.50 late Wednesday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.25
to close at a bid $440.53.
   Silver traded on the New York Comex finished at $7.280 per troy
ounce, up from Wednesday's $7.165. Earlier in London the metal was
buoyed by speculative dealings, rising sharply to a late bid of
$7.35, an eight-month high, from $6.98 bid late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Wells Fargo Considering Bid on Texas Bank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wells Fargo & Co., considering whether to
bid on ailing First RepublicBank Corp., reviewed the books of
Texas' largest bank Thursday while owners of the Dallas-based
company's bonds sought to get their money back.
   Wells Fargo's eight-member team in Dallas is the third group to
go over the finances of First Republic. Citicorp of New York sent a
20-member contingent last month and NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C.,
said last week it had submitted a formal bid to the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.
   ``We plan to cooperate fully with (Wells Fargo's) contingent,''
said First Republic spokeswoman Martha Larsh.
   A Wells Fargo spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the
bank was considering a bid on First Republic. But a Wells Fargo
employee, who asked not to be named, said Vice Chairman David M.
Petrone _ Well's Fargo's chief real estate expert _ was scheduled
to be in Dallas until Friday.
   Industry analysts said First Republic's main problem has been
its non-performing real estate loans.
   Wells Fargo, California's third largest banking concern, emerged
this week as a possible suitor when First Republic Chairman Albert
Casey sent a memo to employees telling them of the the San
Francisco bank's interest.
   ``Speculation in the press has centered on interest by ... Wells
Fargo & Co.,'' said the memo. ``There is truth to that
speculation.''
   Analysts said Wells Fargo's interest in Texas' largest bank
probably was spurred by the FDIC.
   ``The FDIC hopes to get more aggressive with more than one
suitor,'' said Frank Anderson of D. Latin & Co., a Dallas
securities firm.
   A wide field of suitors would give the FDIC an upper hand when
negotiating any possible acquisitions, Anderson said.
   The FDIC is expected to spend nearly $1 billion to assist a
buyer in taking over the Texas bank.
   First Republic, which has 130 branches and $28 billion in
assets, has between $4.5 billion and $9 billion in problem loans,
according to various estimates. Most are commercial real estate
loans, but about $800 million are debts owned by Mexico, Brazil and
other Third World borrowers.
   In the first quarter this year, First Republic lost $1.5
billion, compared with earnings of $10.4 million for the first
quarter of 1987.
   In Dallas, owners of First Republic bonds met with senior
officers of the company in an apparent attempt to find out whether
bondholders will get their money back.
   A spokesman for First RepublicBank, confirmed a meeting between
bondholders and management concluded Thursday afternoon.
   Company spokesman Joe Bowles refused to comment on who
participated in the meeting or what resulted from the talks.
   Don Phelps, spokesman for Irving Trust Co. in New York,
confirmed a meeting took took place Thursday but also declined to
comment.
   Two suits filed by bondholders in June accuse the bank holding
company and the FDIC of improperly trying to wipe them out.
   First RepublicBank has about $1 billion in debt, much of it held
by insurance companies and pension funds that support some of the
country's largest banks.
   MTrust, a subsidiary of MCorp in Dallas that manages outside
investors' bonds, filed suit in a Dallas state court seeking to
stop First RepublicBank from wiping out a class of bonds worth $35
million.
   In Houston, the holder of $55 million in First RepublicBank's
notes, American General Insurance Co., sued the FDIC, challenging
the transaction in which the FDIC made itself first in line to
claim First RepublicBank's assets.
   The FDIC stipulated it would not guarantee debtholders of First
RepublicBank when it backed the bank's depositors after a run in
March.

<HEAD>Singer Reaches Agreements on Sale of Two Divisions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Singer Co. on Thursday said it will
sell its Electronic Systems and HRB divisions for a total of $455
million as part of Florida investor Paul Bilzerian's plan to
finance his buyout of Singer.
   Plessey North America Corp. will acquire Singer's Electronic
Systems Division for $310 million and the Hadson Corp. will acquire
the company's HRB Division for $145 million, Singer said in a
statement.
   The Electronic Systems Division, headquarterd in Wayne, N.J.,
produces airborne computers, radar navigation systems, tactical
electronic equipment and other advanced electronic systems for the
defense industry.
   It employs about 3,400 people and had revenues of $166 million
in 1987.
   Plessey, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Plessey Co. of London,
also produces electronic systems for defense and commercial use.
   ``The involvement of Singer Electronic Systems in advanced
technologies used by the free world's defense forces adds important
new business capabilities to Plessey,'' said Plessey Chairman and
Chief Executive John Clark and Bilzerian, Singer's chairman and
chief executive, in a joint statement.
   ``Singer Electronic Systems, in turn, will benefit in the
worldwide defense electronics industry and is committed to growth
in that field,'' they said.
   Singer and Plessey expect completion of the deal within 60 days.
   The HRB Division, based in State College, Pa., develops signal
interception, processing and analysis systems, principally for U.S.
government intelligence operations. It employs about 1,700 people
and had revenues of $119 million in 1987.
   Hadson, based in Oklahoma City, Okla., is involved in defense,
intelligence and space systems through its subsidiary, Ultrasystems
Defense and Space Inc. The company is projecting revenues of $800
million in 1988, compared to $16.7 million in 1984.
   Singer and Hadson expect to complete the sale by the end of
August.
   Singer will receive $137 million in cash and 2 million shares of
Hadson common stock, representing 5.4 percent of Hadson's total
common shares outstanding.
   ``We elected to take part of HRB's purchase price in Hadson
shares because of the exceptional fit between the company's defense
operations and HRB,'' Bilzerian said.
   ``We are convinced that this acquisition and the company's other
plans for growth give Hadson a brilliant future. Therefore, our
investment in Hadson's common stock is totally supportive of its
current management,'' he added.
   The divisions are the fourth and fifth to be sold since Singer
was acquired earlier this year by a partnership headed by
Bilzerian. In making the acquisition, Bilzerian said at least part
of the company's operations would be divested.

<HEAD>Dry Forecasts Drive Corn, Soybean Prices Higher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Forecasts for another month of drought in the Midwest drove
prices for some corn, oat and soybean futures up their allowable
limits Thursday but late profit-taking tempered the advance. Wheat
finished lower.
   On other markets, sugar futures rallied to a 7-year high; silver
posted sharp gains; lumber futures plunged; livestock and meat were
mostly higher; energy futures rose; and stock-index futures
advanced.
   On the Chicago Board of Trade, all corn, oat and soybean
contracts skyrocketed their respective limits at the opening in
response to the National Weather Service's 6-to-10-day and 30-day
forecasts for continued hot, dry conditions in the Farm Belt.
   Contracts for delivery this summer through next spring held
those limit gains through the close. But prices for later delivery
weakened late in the session and the July contracts, on which
limits have been removed pending next Wednesday's expiration,
posted only modest gains.
   Analysts said the pattern indicated profit-taking, perhaps
stemming from increased _ but still slight _ chances of rain in the
Midwest on Friday.
   ``Even in a wildly bullish market, you don't go limit-up every
day,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc.
   Mario Balletto, soybean analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets Inc., said the slight increases in July prices would allow
other contracts to catch up. Prices for July deliveries of corn and
soybeans had surged far ahead of other delivery months on Wednesday.
   ``On a day like today, things start evening out a little,''
Balletto said.
   Wheat futures finished lower in a technical move after failing
to hold new contract highs.
   Despite the market's mixed performance, grain and soybean prices
remain tied to the weather, analysts agreed.
   Rain is badly needed to salvage the shrinking percentage of the
corn crop that has not already been irreparably damaged by the
drought, and to prevent substantial soybean losses as that crop
enters its flowering and pod-forming stage, Balletto said.
   Wheat settled 4 cents to 10 cents lower with July at $3.88 a
bushel; corn was 2{ cents to 15 cents higher with July at $3.36 a
bushel; oats were 3{ cents to 15 cents higher with July at $3.08 a
bushel; soybeans were 20 cents to 45 cents higher with July at
$9.74 a bushel.
   World sugar futures rallied above 15 cents a pound for the first
time since mid-1981 on New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange.
The bull market is being driven by tight supplies worldwide and
fears of drought damage to the U.S. sugar beet crop.
   ``The market's gone berserk,'' said Erik Dunlaevy, a trader for
Balfour Maclaine Corp. in New York.
   Sugar for October delivery settled .71 cent higher at 15.27
cents a pound;.
   Silver futures prices bounded higher for the second straight day
on New York's Commodity Exchange in a rally motivated by technical
factors and the threat of a miners' strike next week in Peru.
   ``I'm very bullish on silver,'' said Peter Cardillo, commodity
futures trading adviser with Josephthal & Co. in New York. ``Silver
looks like a white horse ready to stampede.''
   Gold moved lower as many banks raised their prime lending rate,
cooling fears of inflation, analysts said.
   Gold was $1.70 to $1.90 lower with August at $439.90 cents a
troy ounce; silver was 11.5 cents to 13.6 cents higher with July at
$7.28 a troy ounce.
   Rising interest rates and a tentative labor agreement by
Canadian paperworkers pressured lumber futures on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for July delivery settled
$6 lower at $193.80 per 1,000 board feet.
   Livestock and meat futures ended mostly higher in heavy trading
on the Chicago Merc, reversing the recent drought-influenced
pattern of sharply lower prices for summer and autumn deliveries.
   Chicago-based analyst Philip Stanley of Thomson McKinnon
Securities Inc., called the turnaround a technical correction.
   Live cattle were .22 cent lower to .95 cent higher with August
at 64.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent lower to .95
cent higher with August at 73.97 cents a pound; hogs were .75 cent
to 1.40 cents higher with July at 46 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.68 cents to the limit 2 cents higher with July at
35.30 cents a pound.
   Crude oil prices rebounded on the New York Mercantile Exchange
after falling for four days.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 32 cents to 43 cents
higher with August at $14.76 a barrel; heating oil was .68 cent to
.21 cent higher with August at 40.91 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .58 cent lower to .30 cent higher with August at 50.54
cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures gained slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for September delivery of the Standard
& Poor's 500 index settled .05 point higher at 271.45.

Profits</HEAD>

   Three big U.S. banking companies reported Thursday that they
were profitable in the second quarter after posting losses a year
earlier.
   The trio _ Chemical Banking Corp., Security Pacific Corp. and
Bank of New York Co. _ had sustained heavy losses in the second
quarter of 1987 from writeoffs for potential losses on loans to
developing countries.
   First City Bancorp. of Texas, meanwhile, which recently received
a $970 million federal bailout, reported net income of $17.2
million for the 72-day period immediately following its $1.6
billion reorganization.
   The restructured bank, based in Houston, said net income for the
initial period ending June 30 was 66 cents a share. Total assets as
of June 30 were $11.3 billion, loans were $6.3 billion, deposits
were $9.1 billion and shareholders' equity was $586 million.
   Chemical Banking, the nation's fourth-largest bank holding
company, said it earned $127.7 million, or $1.98 a share, compared
with a net loss of $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 1987.
   If the loan-loss provisions hadn't been made in the second
quarter of last year, New York-based Chemical would have earned
$76.4 million, or $1.21 a share, it said.
   For the first six months of the year, Chemical had net income of
$253.2 million, or $3.93 a share, compared with a net loss of $1.0
billion in the same period last year.
   The bank said its earnings in the latest quarter and six months
were due to increases in net interest income, trust fees and other
banking fees, gains from venture capital activities and higher
profits from bond trading.
   The company changed its name in late April from Chemical New
York Corp.
   Seventh-ranked Security Pacific reported a profit of $154.3
million, or $1.36 a share, compared to a net loss of $190.2 million
in the second quarter of last year.
   The 1987 second-quarter results were dragged down by a one-time
$558 million provision for bad loans to developing countries. This
year, the company has cut its non-trade developing country debts by
40 percent, said Chairman Richard J. Flamson III.
   In the latest quarter, the company posted net interest income of
$662.2 million, up from $599.1 million in the second quarter of
1987.
   For the first half of 1988, Los Angeles-based Security Pacific
had a net profit of $301.5 million, or $2.66 a share, compared with
a net loss of $73.7 million in the same period last year.
   Bank of New York, the long-time target of a hostile takeover bid
from Irving Bank Corp., said it earned $49.7 million, or $1.30 a
share, compared with a net loss of $34.9 million a year earlier.
   ``These results reflect strong growth in lending activities
accompanied with ... firm control of operating expenses,'' Chairman
J. Carter Bacot said in a statement. He said consumer lending was
especially strong during the latest quarter, rising 49 percent from
a year earlier.
   In the first six months, Bank of New York's net income totaled
$104.1 million, or $2.77 a share, up sharply from $12.4 million, or
34 cents a share, in first-half 1987.

   The narrowest measure of the nation's money
supply fell $1.2 billion in the week ended July 4, the Federal
Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M1 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $777.5 billion from a revised $778.7 billion the previous
week.
   But a broader measure, M2, rose to a seasonally adjusted $3.023
trillion in the same week from $3.019 trillion a week earlier.
   An even broader measure, M3, decreased to a seasonally adjusted
$3.807 trillion from $3.808 trillion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $396 million in
the week ended July 6, compared with a decline of $857 million a
week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System averaged $1.332 billion, up from $1.301 billion.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $2.785 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, down from $2.789 billion two weeks earlier.

   The hike in the prime lending rate Thursday to
its highest level in more than two years is not the start of
another upward spiral in interest rates, many economists maintained.
   They predicted that rates will hold at current levels probably
until after the November election, but they conceded that this
forecast is contingent on a slowdown in overall economic growth.
   If this expected slowdown does not occur and inflationary
pressures remain high, then their interest rate forecasts will be
proven wrong, analysts said.
   Big banks raised their prime lending rate one-half percentge
point to 9.5 percent on Thursday. It was the second boost this year
and put the key borrowing rate at its highest level since March
1986.
   The increase followed by one day stern warnings from Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that the central bank stood ready
to tighten credit even further if inflation shows signs of
worsening.
   Some economists said Greenspan's tough talk put financial
markets on notice that the central bank will be pushing interest
rates higher in the weeks ahead.
   But other analysts read Greenspan's comments as a signal that
while the Fed did tighten credit conditions significantly from late
March to late June, the tightening process is over for the time
being.
   For one thing, Greenspan appeared to downplay prospects that the
central bank soon would hike its discount rate, which has been at 6
percent since last September.
   An increase in the discount rate, the interest the Fed charges
to make loans to financial institutions, is the most dramatic
signal the central bank can send of its intentions to tighten
credit.
   In the first five months of the year, retail prices increased at
an annual rate of 4.4 percent, the inflation rate for all of 1987,
and inflation appeared to be slightly stronger in the last few
months than earlier this year.
   Greenspan made it clear that he believed unemployment, which
dropped to a 14-year low of 5.3 percent in June, cannot go much
lower without risking accelerating wage demands and higher
inflation. But he indicated that he expected both the unemployment
rate and current high factory operating rates will begin leveling
off in the months ahead.
   Analysts said these two indicators of economic strength, along
with the various measurements of inflation, will be the key ones to
watch to determine future interest rate moves.
   ``Greenspan's testimony indicates that the central bank expects
the economy to soften and inflation to settle down in the second
half of the year,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston
Co. ``If that forecast comes true, then there will be no need for
the Fed to tighten further.''
   David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., said the
latest increase in the prime rate was in response to the Fed
tightening which has already occurred.
   Greenspan indicated that over the past three months the Fed has
pushed up a key short-term interest rate, the federal funds rate,
by a full percentage point.
   The federal funds rate is the interest banks charge each other
for overnight loans and it is heavily influenced by Fed decisions
on bank reserves.
   ``The hike in the prime rate is not the start of something new.
It is simply a reflection of the earlier tightening steps,'' Jones
said. ``I think we will see interest rates remain stable at these
levels for the next few months.''
   David Wyss, chief financial economist of Data Resources Inc.,
predicted a period of steady interest rates between now and the
November election, saying that neither the Fed nor major banks want
to risk getting embroiled in the presidential campaign by making
further tightening moves.
   Wyss said that based on banks' cost of funds, an increase of
0.25 percentage points in the prime rate on Thursday would have
been more justified than the one-half percentage point increase
which did occur.
   ``I think the banks wanted to get all of the bad news out of the
way before the election,'' Wyss said. ``The closer you get to an
election, the harder it is to raise rates because the more
politically sensitive such a decision is.''
   While predicting a period of stable rates for now, many
economists said they believed rates will head higher before the end
of the year, in part because of a belief that inflation will remain
higher than the Fed will be willing to tolerate.
   Some analysts said they were looking for fixed-rate mortages,
which are currently at 10.4 percent, to be around 11 percent by the
end of the year. They said they expected one more rise in the prime
rate, as well, after the election, boosting it to 10 percent.

<HEAD>Raytheon Reports 10 Percent Increase in Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEXINGTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense contractor Raytheon Co. reported
a 10.4 percent increase in second-quarter earnings Thursday.
   The company said it had net income of $122.3 million, or $1.84
per share, up from $110.8 million, or $1.50 per share, for the
similar quarter a year ago. Sales were $2.04 billion, compared with
$1.92 billion during the second quarter of 1987.
   For the first six months of the year, earnings were $235.6
million, or $3.52 per share, on sales of $3.99 billion, up from
first half earnings of $212.6 million, or $2.87 per share, on sales
of $3.67 billion for 1987.
   Higher sales, improved operating performance and lower taxes all
contributed to the increase in company-wide earnings, Raytheon said.
   ``As we reported in the first quarter, Beech and Energy Services
have turned around,'' said Raytheon Chairman Thomas L. Phillips.
``As a result, all five business segments were again profitable in
the second quarter.''
   In addition, earnings per share were further improved by fewer
shares outstanding.
   This year, average shares outstanding were 66.6 million in the
second quarter and 66.9 million in the first half, compared with
73.8 million and 74 million respectively last year.
   In the second quarter, 938,700 shares were purchased, completing
the acquisition of 20 million shares previusly authorized by the
board of directors.

<HEAD>Judge Denies Shareholder Challenge To Dome Acquisition</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Dollar figures are U.S.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CALGARY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ruled against a shareholder challenge to
Amoco Canada's $4.5 billion takeover of Dome Petroleum on Thursday,
and Amoco indicated it believed the transaction could be completed
within months.
   Justice Gregory Forsyth of Court of Queen's Bench ruled that the
acquisition was fair to all parties, and he saw no need for Amoco
to amend its buyout proposal.
   The ruling went against preferred shareholder Gordon Savage, who
headed the last of three shareholder groups _ including one headed
by Dome founder Jack Gallagher _ opposed to the transaction. The
other two bowed out about two weeks ago after accepting settlements
from Amoco.
   ``I have found...that the bid for Dome was done in a competitive
fashion and resulted in the best possible price,'' Forsyth ruled.
   Allan Sternberg, Savage's attorney, would not say whether he
will appeal the ruling. Sternberg had indicated during the fairness
hearing he would appeal any decision in favor of Dome-Amoco. He has
20 days to do so.
   Sternberg told reporters he wants to reserve comment until the
court decides who is responsible for costs in the case.
   T. Don Stacy, president of the U.S.-owned Amoco Canada, told
reporters the company was pleased with the decision, but noted
several hurdles remained before the merger could be completed.
   One issue is a $331 million loan to Dome by the Arctic Petroleum
Corp. of Japan. The consortium loaned Dome the money for Beaufort
Sea exploration and now seeks better repayment terms than Amoco is
offering.
   Asked if the consortium could still scuttle the entire deal,
Stacy said, ``Yes.'' But he said there had been progress in
resolving the matter.
   In a news release, Stacy said he hoped to close the Dome
acquisition next month.
   Bidding for Dome closed almost 15 months ago. Amoco hoped its
merger would be complete in six months, but that was before some of
the debt-ridden company's creditors and shareholders challenged the
move in court. Forsyth threw out the challenges one by one.
   The fairness hearing was the last legal obstacle to Amoco's
acquistion of Dome, which is about $5.2 billion in debt.
   Sternberg had argued that shareholders did not have complete
information when they voted 87 per cent in favor of the deal early
last month. He contended shareholders were unaware of an internal
Amoco document _ since made public _ showing the company estimated
Dome's value at up to $6 billion, and were unaware of a competing
$5.4 billion buyout offer by a group of Middle Eastern oilmen.
   Forsyth dismissed both claims, saying the competing offer was
``nothing more than a sham'' and that shareholder information
packages were prepared and distributed correctly.

<HEAD>GM Announces Recall of About 155,000 Cars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. announced Thursday it is
recalling about 155,000 model 1986-88 cars to correct a variety of
problems, including brake, wiring and fuel filler neck difficulties.
   The automaker said it is not aware of any accidents or injuries
attributed to the problems. Owners will be notified to take their
cars to dealers, who will make the necessary repairs at no charge,
GM said.
   Dealers will inspect about 73,000 model 1988 Pontiac LeMans for
defects in fuel filler neck construction. The condition could cause
fuel to leak from the filler neck mechanism in excess of federal
safety standards, GM said.
   On 65,000 model 1986 and 1987 Buick Rivieras and Oldsmobile
Toronados, a problem with the power steering pump hose could cause
a fluid leak, GM said. Dealers will replace the hose with another
pump mechanism.
   About 15,000 model 1988 Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunbird
coupes and convertibles may have faulty rear lamp wiring that could
cause backup lamps to flash or render them inoperative, GM said.
Dealers will make the necessary wiring changes.
   About 1,900 model 1987 and 1988 Buick LeSabres with anti-lock
brake systems could lose brake functions over time, GM said.
Dealers will tighten hydraulic unit mounting bolts to correct the
problem, the automaker said.
   About 430 model 1988 Oldsmobile 98 Touring Sedans have a problem
that could prevent the driver from seeing the shift indicator in
the dark or bump it into another gear. Dealers will replace a clip
to assure the indicator is properly positioned, GM said.

   President Reagan, lending moral support to
drought-stricken farmers while Congress mulls financial relief,
said Thursday the government must act quickly to help America cope
with the ``worst natural disaster since the Dust Bowl of the
1930s.''
   ``What I saw was not a pretty sight,'' Reagan said after walking
through sun-parched corn and soybean fields in his native Illinois.
``Stunted corn, sparse beanfields, withered plants starved for
water, struggling to push their way through.''
   He promised farmers that ``we will do everything that we can.''
At the same time, he called on Congress to ``act quickly'' on a
package of legislation aimed at making emergency federal aid
available to farmers.
   After inspecting fields on foot and by helicopter, the president
held up a portion of a corn stalk and told reporters, ``This is the
tassle, you see, but there's no silk yet.''
   Reagan, who returned to the White House in early evening, used
his tour to announce that he was dispatching Agriculture Secretary
Richard Lyng on a tour of several states hard hit by the dry spell.
   The president had planned several months ago to return to the
station that launched his radio career _ WOC in Davenport, Iowa _
and he kept that appointment Thursday, joining station executives
in marking its 65th anniversary of broadcasting.
   But if the radio station appearance presented Reagan with a
nostaligic return to his early days of radio in the 1930s, the
witnessing of the drought's effects also evoked thoughts about that
decade.
   ``From Montana to Texas, from California to Georgia, and right
here in Illinois, farmers face the worst natural disaster since the
Dust Bowl of the 1930s,'' Reagan told a group of state agriculture
officials and farmers gathered at the Du Quoin State Fairgrounds
near here.
   He voiced concern that a bipartisan farm aid program drafted by
leaders of the congressional agricultural committee might become
weighted down with special-interest amendments.
   Lawmakers earlier this week unveiled a $5.5 billion plan that
would provide payments of up to $100,000 to keep farmers on their
land despite the withering heat and lack of rain.
   ``There may be some very fine amendments that belong on the
bill,'' Reagan said, ``but also, every once in a while, it becomes
a Christmas tree, with people trying to attach things that really
have no bearing on the main purpose.''
   ``I'm calling today for Congress to act quickly on comprehensive
drought relief for all farmers, for all crops,'' he said.
   In an interview with WOC, Reagan said he is waiting for the farm
relief bill. ``I will sign it the minte it is delivered to me,'' he
said.
   The president touched on the bill again in a luncheon speech in
Davenport. ``Partisanship should be kept out of the issue of
drought relief,'' he said. ``Politics must stop at the parched
field's edge.''
   At the conclusion of his speech, the president was presented a
framed replica of a special edition of the front page of the Quad
City Times with photographs of him as a child of four in 1914, a
football star in 1927, a high-school graduate in 1928, on a
postcard in the late 1930s during his movie career, as governor of
California in 1967 and as president in 1988.
   He quipped, ``I was never as young as I am in some of those
pictures.''
   The Agriculture Department said Tuesday that the corn crop this
year may be 29 percent less than expected a few months ago, and 26
percent below last year's bumper harvest. It said sharp reductions
also are expected for 1988 wheat and soybean production.
   After landing at Williamson County Airport near here, Reagan
boarded his helicopter for a 25-minute aerial inspection of the
crop damage. The president, observed by reporters traveling in
another helicopter flying in a loose formation with Marine One,
could be seen looking out the window, occasionally gesturing toward
other passengers, as he witnessed the devastation.
   Once on the ground, he joined his farm hosts, Herman and Richard
Krone, for a walking tour of corn and soybean fields.
   Reagan, a six-footer, towered over the corn stalks, which
reached just past his waist. By this time of year, they should have
grown to eight feet.
   He then crossed a dirt road and walked through a soybean field,
which ad many gaping spots where there was nothing but soil.
   ``The situation on the ground, I'm sorry to say, is as bad as I
expected,'' the president said at the fairgrounds.
   Reagan said recent rains may have helped some, ``but it hasn't
solved the problem. And for many farmers, time has run out.''
   Noting that 1,973 counties in 38 states have qualified so far
for federal emergency agricultural disaster relief aid, he said,
``We can't make it rain, but we can help to ease the pain.''
   ``It will end. It always has in the past,'' Reagan said. ``But
the question is, when will it end and how much of the crop can be
saved.''
   ``I wanted to let you know that we will do everything that we
can,'' he said.
   Reagan, who doffed his suitcoat for the walking tour, drank iced
tea at a picnic table outside the Krones' farmhouse as he
commiserated with the father and son about the crop damage they
have suffered.
   Richard Krone, speaking just before Reagan went to the mike at
the fairgrounds, said, ``There's no one here looking for a handout.
These people here realize only so much can be done.''

<HEAD>Congressman Requests Investigation of SEC Restricting Access to
Documents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The congressional watchdog agency was asked
Thursday to investigate complaints that the Securities and Exchange
Commission is restricting access to documents in its public
reference room.
   Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., chairman of the House Government
Operations subcommittee on government information, asked the
General Accounting Office, Congress' auditing wing, to look into
complaints about the commission's policy on how access is granted
to its records _ on paper and on microfiche _ of publicly traded
corporations.
   ``Users of the SEC reference room have charged that new access
regulations interfere with the public's right to know, threaten to
undermine investor protection, restrict the ability to gather news
about financial markets and provide de facto monopoly access to
timely financial data to a single company,'' English said in a
statement.
   Mary McCue, an SEC spokeswoman, said the agency keeps records on
paper for 30 days. After that, records are kept on microfiche.
Because over time the microfiche records have become disordered,
McCue said the agency decided last month to permit only SEC
employees to have access to those files.
   Reference room users now must fill out request forms for
microfiche and the goal is to supply it within one to four hours,
she said. There is still open access to paper records.
   However, Pat Clawson, Washington bureau chief of Radio and
Records, a weekly industry newspaper, said much longer delays of
eight hours or even several days are commonplace under the new
policy, compared with access within several minutes under the old
policy.
   ``These elongated time frames critically hamper newsgathering
activities pressured by deadlines,'' said Clawson, who is
organizing opposition to the new policy.
   The SEC actions ``represent a clear and present danger to the
public's right to know and threaten to undermine investor
protection,'' he said.
   He also charged that in many cases Bechtel Information Services,
a Gaithersburg, Md., firm which provides microfilming and copying
services under contract with the SEC, has the first access to
documents _ before the public reference room and before a press
room, which the SEC maintains for news organizations.
   Bechtel also sells copies of documents and thus competes with
about 23 other privately owned investor services which operate out
of the public reference room.
   Because Bechtel gets some documents first, ``you've got the
creation of a de facto monopoly here of the government's securities
files,'' Clawson said.
   McCue of the SEC said the Bechtel contract, which is renewable
annually, was awarded competitively and the commission reviews the
fees it charges to supply copies.
   She also blamed employees of the investor services, which
compete against one another, for misfiling and losing microfiche
files. She said the SEC has been unable to increase its reference
room staff even though the number of documents filed with the
commission and the number of people using the room have soared in
response to the boom in corporate takeovers and mergers.
   ``In an ideal world, we'd double the number of staff people we
have and double the size of the room. I'm afraid we don't live in
an ideal world,'' she said.
   Clawson, however, said the problem is ``rampant mismanagement on
the part of the SEC.''
