   The federal indictment of PTL founder Jim
Bakker is the latest in a series of woes to befall TV evangelists
since Bakker first resigned amid a sex and hush-money scandal a year
and a half ago.
   Scandals rocking the industry have put a choke hold on
contributions, and many so-called televangelists are facing the
harsh reality that financial support from the public could become
increasingly harder to come by.
   Bakker left the Fort Mill-based television ministry and Christian
theme park known as Heritage USA in March 1987, after admitting to a
sexual encounter with former New York church secretary Jessica Hahn.
   Bakker left PTL, which had assets totaling $160 million, with
debts of as much as $130 million. PTL entered federal bankruptcy
reorganization proceedings in June 1987.
   In May of that year, the Rev. Leroy Jenkins offered to pay the
Bakkers a total of $175,000 to perform on a weekly television show.
Jenkins said his call-in show and faith-healing services from his
Healing Hill Cathedral in Delaware at the time were broadcast on
about 20 radio stations.
   Jenkins had spent more than three years in prison, for conspiracy
to commit arson and assault, and said his troubles motivated his
offer to help the Bakkers.
   Bakker, and his top aide, the Rev. Richard Dortch, were defrocked
later in 1987 by the Assemblies of God, a Pentecostal, charismatic
denomination.
   Revelations of possible homosexual activities and accusations by
the IRS that the Bakkers and top aides took nearly $15 million from
the ministry in salaries and unjustified compensation seemed to
serve as a catalyst for the crumbling of the electronic church.
   Less than a year after Assemblies of God minister Jimmy Swaggart
blasted Bakker for his sexual indiscretions, the Louisiana
evangelist was crying at the pulpit while he admitted that he had
sinned against God and family.
   The Assemblies' Louisiana state hierarchy ordered Swaggart to
immediately begin a two-year rehabilitation period that would limit
his preaching and place him in counseling. Swaggart resigned from
the Assemblies of God church in April, just as national church
officials moved to defrock him.
   Another defrocked Assemblies of God minister, Marvin Gorman of
suburban New Orleans, reportedly hired the men who photographed
Swaggart with a prostitute outside a motel.
   Even before Bakker and Swaggart, Oral Roberts had made some
question the credibility of TV ministers.
   Roberts, who had built an evangelistic empire including a
university and a hospital in Tulsa, Okla., told his followers that
God might ``take me home'' if he failed to raise $8 million by the
end of March 1988.
   Roberts also claimed to have raised several people from the dead.
   The electronic church's troubles led former Republican
presidential contender Pat Robertson, chairman of the Christian
Broadcasting Network, to say he resented being identified as a
television evangelist.
   Robertson resigned as a Southern Baptist minister and as CBN
chairman in October 1987, and stopped appearing as host on ``The 700
Club'' TV show.
   Audiences for televangelists began to dry up, along with
contributions.
   Roberts lost about 35 percent of his audience, according to
Arbitron figures published in September. The report showed Roberts
in July 1988 in the No. 4 spot with 561,000 households, down from
863,000 a year earlier.
   The Arbitron report showed Swaggart's audience dropped from the
top-rated spot in July 1987 to No.3 in July 1988, with only half the
previous audience. His daily program dropped from 11th to 17th
during the same period, according to Arbitron, which measures
viewership on commercial television stations.
   Swaggart's No.1 shw, ``A Study in the Word,'' was replaced by a
show whose host was Robert Schuller, founder of the Garden Grove
Community Church known for its Crystal Cathedral. Swaggart's show
was seen by 1.19 million households in the summer of 1988;
Schuller's show was seen in 1.21 million households.
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell, whose Lynchburg, Va., ministry includes
the ``Old-Time Gospel Hour, has said ``the credibility crisis is
unbelievable.''
   Published reports on Nov. 30, citing tax records, showed
contributions to Falwell's show had dropped by more than $10 million
to $40.7 million, and that the ministry's net worth has fallen by
nearly $5 million from last year.
   Falwell, who also founded the Moral Majority, briefly stepped in
to try to salvage PTL after Bakker left.
   Contributions to PTL, which at one time bulged to millions, now
barely manage to equal costs.
   The National Religious Broadcasters tried to put the brakes on
the downward slide in February when they adopted a financial and
moral code of ethics. It requires public disclosure of annual,
independent audits of all income and expenditures, except for
salaries. The NRB claims 1,350 member organizations.
   Billy Graham, considered the father of television evangelism,
apparently has managed to remain above the fracas, and said his
ministry continues to prosper amid the unholy hubbub.

<TEXT>
   Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
and Cuban leader Fidel Castro are poles apart ideologically, but
they found a way to do each other some good last week.
   The occasion was Thursday's inauguration of Salinas, an economist
who believes in individual effort and a smaller government.
   All Castro, a fundamentalist of communism, had to do was show up.
   Salinas' opponents, who maintain that his ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party cheated to win the presidency, were quick to
note that the occasion marked the first time foreign heads of state
had been invited to a presidential inauguration.
   ``They're desperately searching for support outside the country
because they don't have any support inside the country,'' said
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the leftist Democratic Front leader, last week.
   The Salinas transition team said Latin American heads of state
were invited because those countries wanted to invite Mexican
presidents to their own inaugurations. They said the invitations
would encourage Latin American unity.
   Those in the leftist opposition were especially disappointed that
Castro and President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua decided to come.
   ``It's up to them if they want to lend support to an illegitimate
government,'' Cardenas said before the inauguration.
   While Salinas was able to undercut his opponents and bolster his
own image, Castro saw a larger geopolitical significance in the
invitation.
   The fact that he was sitting in the same gallery with other heads
of state and a galaxy of other dignitaries, including U.S. Secretary
of State George Shultz, was both a recognition of his nation and a
symbol of triumph, he said.
   ``The U.S. strategy of isolating Cuba has failed,'' he said at a
weekend news conference. ``We never came to an inauguration before
because they didn't invite us. But now Ecuador and Mexico have
invited us. U.S. policy is a total wreck, and Cuba's position is
being vindicated by Latin America. Thirty years have gone by, and
we're still here.''
   Castro's forces overthrew the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista
almost exactly 30 years ago, on Jan. 1, 1959.
   Ironically, one of Castro's patrons when he was organizing his
revolution here was Lazaro Cardenas, Cuauhtemoc's father.
   Lazaro Cardenas, a former president, a leftist and a power in
Mexican politics, got Castro out of trouble when he was imprisoned
while training his little band of revolutionaries near Mexico City.
   Castro was treated like a conquering hero from the moment he
arrived at Mexico City's airport Wednesday night.
   At news conferences he received lengthy rounds of applause from
local reporters. On a walking tour of the city's central Alameda, he
kissed women and children and recovered an old man's windblown hat.
   One local columnist even complimented Castro's huge squad of
bodyguards for their ``backslapping friendliness.''
   Salinas made sure to introduce the attending heads of state
during his inaugural address Thursday, and Castro got by far the
biggest ovation. By that time Cardenas supporters already had walked
out.
   Castro stood and smiled, then sat back as Salinas made it plain
he would push Mexico toward the free market and further away from
state domination of the economy.
   ``Social well-being in a modern state is not identified with
paternalism that supplants effort or inhibits character,'' Salinas
said.
   Castro, by contrast, summed up a long news conference statement
on the evils of capitalism by saying: ``Socialism cannot be built
with capitalist tools.''
   The comment was an implicit criticism of the reforms of Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Castro will be receiving a visit
from Gorbachev later this week.
   One issue upon which Salinas and Castro agreed on is the need to
reduce Latin America's staggering foreign debt. Mexico's stands at
$102 billion.
   But while Castro called for Draconian measures of non-payment,
Salinas leaned toward negotiation and a sales job, telling bankers
the money Mexico saves will be used to drive economic growth in a
competitive economy.
   Salinas and U.S. President-elect George Bush met 10 days before
Salinas was inaugurated and hit it off. There was ``good
chemistry,'' said Shultz, ``and that is a very good sign.''
   Castro's assessment of Bush was cautious. He said he hoped Bush
was ``pragmatic'' enough to recognize new Latin American realities,
among them the failure of U.S. efforts to isolate Cuba.
   He said Cuba would consider rejoining the Organization of
American States as an active member if invited and if the OAS became
more of a venue for Latin American nations to act in concert about
their problems.
   Castro ended his trip with a nostalgic visit to Tuxpan, the port
from which he set sail to revolutionary victory 32 years ago.
   ``Mexico is like a second fatherland. Mexico was the only country
to refuse to submit to the orders of the United States. It was the
only one not to break relations with Cuba,'' he said, referring to
Mexico's refusal to join a U.S.-led diplomatic boycott of Cuba in
the 1960s.
   ``We need Mexico. We need the prestige of Mexico,'' Castro said.

<HEAD>Ex-FBI Agent Jailed For Refusing To Testify At Teamsters Trial</HEAD>

   A former FBI agent who was the top agency
contact for Jackie Presser's role as a Teamsters informant was
jailed Monday for refusing to testify at the embezzlement and
racketeering trial of two union officials.
   ``My position is the same as Friday,'' Robert S. Friedrick told
U.S. District Court Judge George W. White, who revoked Friedrick's
$1,000 bond and ordered him jailed to try to force him to testify
under a grant of immunity.
   Friedrick's attorney, William D. Beyer, has appealed the judge's
contempt citation of Friday to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in Cincinnati.
   Friedrick invoked his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination when called as a witness Friday. Prosecutors had
tried to have three of his sworn sworn statements admitted as
evidence but White ruled the material untrustworthy.
   Beyer said the Friedrick interviews on Jan. 8, 9 and 13 of 1986
conflicted with Friedrick's earlier testimony. Because there were
two versions of his statement, Beyer said any new testimony could
conflict with one or the other version and might put Friedrick in
jeopardy of perjury charges.
   Government attorneys indicated they wanted to call Friedrick to
the stand to prove that Presser's FBI informant ``handlers'' never
authorized the union's hiring ``ghost employees'' who were paid for
doing no work.
   Stephen H. Jigger, a government prosecutor, said Friedrick's
testimony was crucial because, of three Presser FBI ``handlers,''
Friedrick sometimes was the only agent who attended meetings with
Presser and Anthony Hughes, a co-defendant and recording secretary
of Teamsters Local 507 in Cleveland.
   Hughes and Harold Friedman, a Teamsters international vice
president and president of Local 507, are charged with plotting a
$700,000 scheme to hire ``ghost employees.'' Presser, who was
Teamsters international president, was indicted on similar charges,
but died July 9 before going on trial.
   After Friedrick, who was fired by the FBI in August 1986,
repeated his unwillingness to testify, deputy U.S. marshals took him
into custody. The U.S. Marshal's Service said he was taken to the
Justice Center lockup.
   The judge said Friedrick could be jailed for up to 18 months for
criminal contempt.
   Jigger also asked the judge to consider delaying the trial to
give Friedrick time behind bars to reconsider his unwillingness to
testify. Jigger said the prosecution has just one more witness to
call.
   William C. Lynch, a senior Justice Department trial attorney also
on the prosecution team, said the grant of immunity would rule out
use against Friedrick any testimony he gives in the current trial.
   The judge excused the jury until Wednesday for procedural
arguments outside the its presence.

   The Reagan administration would find ``nothing
embarrassing'' in concluding a meeting with Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev that produced no breakthroughs or agreements, a White
House spokesman said Monday.
   But the two sides, expanding the superpower dialogue, decided to
set up a separate session between Secretary of State George P.
Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   The session will be held at the U.S. Mission to the United
Nations on Wednesday morning in advance of Gorbachev's luncheon on
Governors Island, N.Y., with President Reagan and President-elect
George Bush, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said.
   While striving to limit American expectations for the luncheon
meeting, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater acknowledged that
Gorbachev could spring a surprise there.
   Reminded that various Soviet officials and analysts have said
over the weekend that Gorbachev had more in mind than just a cordial
talk with Reagan and Bush, Fitzwater said, ``I'm sure the Soviets
want to put a positive face on this trip.''
   The U.S. Embassy in Moscow, citing comments of a Soviet foreign
trade official, has advised Washington in a cablegram to expect
several new proposals aimed at lowering U.S. limits on trade and
lending with communist countries, The New York Times reported in
Tuesday editions.
   The proposals are said to include Soviet access to American stock
and financial markets, clearing the way for the Soviet Union to
issue bonds and other securities in the United States.
   Gorbachev may also use the trip to express Soviet interest in
gaining access to several international economic organizations
including the World Bank, the cable said, according to the Times.
   The Soviet leader also may discuss advance arrangements for an
early summit with Bush and plans to use his U.N. speech to call for
``new momentum'' in dealing with a variety of international issues,
Soviet academician Georgi Arbatov told a New York news conference
Monday.
   Another Soviet official, Central Committee spokesman Nikolai
Shishlin, offered a similar assessment, saying the ``key issue'' of
Gorbachev's visit will be discussing ways to translate his ``new
political thinking'' into progress in international relations.
   But Fitzwater said he was unaware of any major new Soviet
initiative, and suggested that U.S. officials would not let
Gorbachev put them under pressure to respond immediately to new
proposals.
   ``We are being very realistic,'' Fitzwater said, explaining the
U.S. situation this way:
   ``We have a president who is leaving office in a few weeks, who
is not going to be making any promises that he is not here to keep.
And we have a new president who will be taking office in a few
weeks, who is not going to be making commitments when he doesn't
have an administration in power that can fully analyze and make
these judgments.
   ``So we find nothing embarrassing or in any way negative about
characterizing this meeting as a friendly discussion,'' Fitzwater
said, ``an open airing of issues between us and a healthy approach
towards continuity.''
   He said the fact that U.S. and Soviet officials can sit down and
talk, without there having to be tangible, immediate results or
agreements, illustrates ``the strength of the new relationship''
between Washington and Moscow.
   ``This meeting is symbolic of that ... the fact that you can have
meetings without having 10-month kinds of summits (summits about 10
months apart) that we've known in the past,'' he said.
   Reagan and Gorbachev had a five-day summit in Moscow last spring.
The two exchanged the final instruments of ratification for the
treaty banning short-and intermediate-range nuclear weapons, during
that meeting.
   ``But there is no reason to expect anything more than that from
the U.S. side at this juncture,'' he added. The spokesman said, for
instance, that at the present time, there is no call for a meeting
in New York of the U.S.-Soviet arms negotiating teams.
   Fitzwater also said that neither he nor other U.S. officials know
what Gorbachev plans to tell the U.N. General Assembly in his
address Wednesday, which is scheduled just before the Kremlin leader
travels to Governors Island to meet Reagan and Bush.
   He said that the language of the Soviet advance team over the
weekend was ``optimistic and upbeat and so forth, but it was all
very general. ...''
   ``It's certainly true that we don't expect to be making any new
proposals, and we don't expect any in the sense of requiring
on-the-site response or any on-location negotiating or anything like
that,'' Fitzwater said. ``Obviously, they'll have new ideas or
things to say, may have fresh approaches to some of the regional
problems. And that's all well and good.''
   If a surprise proposal is advanced by Gorbachev, he said, ``we'll
say, `Thank you,' and we'll take a look at them.''
   Fitzwater said that Reagan briefed on the East-West situation by
national security adviser Colin D. Powell, and Bush joined the
president for Monday's session in the Oval Office.

   A nightclub manager who pleaded
guilty to manslaughter in the beating death of jazz bassist Jaco
Pastorius was sentenced to 21 months in prison and placed on five
years' probation.
   Broward County Circuit Judge M. Daniel Futch Jr. agreed to the
maximum sentence possible for Luc Havan.
   Pastorius, 35, of Fort Lauderdale, died Sept. 21, 1987, of severe
head injuries received in a beating 10 days earlier by Havan, 26, of
Oakland Park, police said.
   Investigators said Pastorius was drunk and tried to gain entrance
to the after-hours club Havan managed. In his plea, Havan contended
he pushed Pastorius as he tried to enter the club.
   Pastorius, a three-time Grammy Award nominee, was hailed for his
innovative work on the bass guitar. He worked with such performers
as Weather Report, Joni Mitchell, Herbie Hancock and Blood, Sweat
and Tears.

<TEXT>
   The father of a 19-year-old
Marine whose skeletal remains were believed found about two miles
north of the base here has expressed relief that the 12-week search
was over.
   The remains, a wallet containing the identification of Marine
Lance Cpl. Jason Rother, an M-16 rifle and a grenade launcher were
found Sunday, said Capt. Kevin Murphy, a spokesman for the Marine
Corps Air Ground Combat Center 125 miles east of downtown Los
Angeles.
   ``There's a sadness, but a feeling of relief,'' said Rother's
father, Jeff Rother of Cleveland, Ohio. ``This has been a
three-month ordeal. It's been a nightmare, but it's good to finally
get this behind us and see this coming to an end.''
   The remains were found near the community of Bagdad, two miles
north of the base and less than a mile from former Highway 66, the
National Trails Highway, authorities said. That is 17 miles from
where Rother was dropped off for a night training exercise Aug. 31.
   ``This puts him farther than we figured he could have made it
to,'' Murphy said. ``What was really unfortunate is that he got less
than a mile from Highway 66.''
   The remains were found by San Bernardino County sheriff's
deputies who were conducting a practice exercise using a scenario
based on Rother's disappearance, sheriff's Deputy Chief Jerome
Ringhofer said.
   Rother, from Minneapolis, was attached to a unit based at Camp
Lejeune, N.C. He was acting as a road guard, directing traffic as
convoys maneuvered through the night and was to have been picked up
at 1 p.m. Aug. 31.
   A mixup in communications left him in three-days of scorching
heat with three canteens of water. He was reported missing 1{ days
later.
   Three officers are facing court-martials in connection with
Rother's disappearance and two others have been relieved of their
commands.

   South Africa, which last week walked out of
U.S.-mediated talks seeking the withdrawal of foreign forces from
southwestern Africa, reportedly has assured the United States it
will sign the settlement.
   The Washington Post reported in Tuesday's editions that South
Africa has resolved an internal conflict over terms of the accord
and that U.S. officials expect at least that the protocol to the
settlement will be signed later this month and perhaps the full
document as well.
   ``It looks as though they have worked out what was bothering
them,'' the newspaper quoted an unidentified U.S. official as
saying. ``They will go ahead.''
   The walkout had prompted speculation that South Africa would not
sign the agreement but the Post said the delay appeared to be caused
by internal South African political dynamics and not terms of the
accord.
   The goal of the talks, which involve Cuba, Angola and South
Africa, is agreement on the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola
and on Namibian independence from South Africa. U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Chester Crocker is serving as mediator for the
talks.
   Before the start of the talks in Brazzaville, the Congo, there
had been high hopes they would conclude with a signed agreement. But
the South African delegation walked out Saturday night, producing
speculation that the negotiations had been derailed.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Monday there was
``considerable progress'' last week and ``we still look forward
resolving the issues that remain and concluding a final settlement
as soon as possible.''
   He denied suggestions that a hitch had developed in the talks
over the process by which the withdrawal of Cuban troops would be
verified.
   ``Unless the parties change their basic decisions, the process
remains on track,'' Redman said.
   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha also has denied that the
talks are at an impasse.
   ``The process is irreversible,'' Botha said Sunday. ``We continue
to progress step-by-step.'' He added that the talks could be resumed
within a few days.

<TEXT>
   A Vicksburg minister charged with
murdering his girlfriend just hours before preaching a Sunday sermon
pleaded guilty Monday to the reduced charge of manslaughter.
   The plea bargain was reached the day before the Rev. Jonathon
Hamlin's scheduled trial for the July 3 shooting death of
24-year-old Lula Sims. A Jan. 6 sentencing date was set by Circuit
Judge Rush Clements, said Otha Jones, chief deputy in the Warren
County Sheriff's Department.
   Hamlin, a 24-year-old married man with three children, had been
living with Sims, investigators said.
   Sheriff Paul Barrett has said Hamlin confessed to the killing of
Sims, a divorced mother of three. He said Hamlin led law enforcement
officers to a shallow grave in rural Jefferson County, about 40
miles southeast of Vicksburg, where Sims' body was found about a
week after she was reported missing.
   Hamlin had been pastor at the Zion Traveler Missionary Baptist
Church since Nov. 1987, and shocked church members had praised him
as a ``first-class minister'' even after learning of the murder
charge. He also was pastor of two other small churches in the
Vicksburg area.
   Police were unsuccessful in getting Hamlin's wife, Martha Hamlin,
to answer questions in the case. Under Mississippi law, one spouse
cannot be forced to testify against the other.
   Hamlin remains free until his sentencing on a $100,000 bond he
posted after his arrest July 3, Jones said.
   There is no telephone number listed for Hamlin, and no one
answered calls for comment Monday to the home and office of his
attorney, Travis Vance Jr. of Vicksburg.

<TEXT>
   A $1.6 million damage award won by a man who said
he got AIDS from a blood-based medicine he took for hemophilia, was
reversed Monday by a federal judge who ruled the evidence did not
support a jury's verdict.
   U.S. District Judge Orinda Evans said in a 14-page ruling that
the verdict, reached by a federal jury after two days of
deliberation in October, had no basis in law or fact. She reversed
the verdict in favor of Randy L. Jones, 35, and granted judgment for
Miles Laboratories.
   Miles, based in Elkhart, Ind., manufactures Koate, a blood-based
``Factor VIII'' clotting product which Jones took to control a mild
case of hemophilia after surgery at Clayton General Hospital in 1983.
   Jones who lives in the Atlanta area, was diagnosed in 1985 as
infected with the virus that causes AIDS. Two years later, he was
told by doctors he had developed the disease itself.
   In his lawsuit, Jones contended the drug he took had been
contaminated with the AIDS virus contracted by an unemployed Texas
man who allegedly sold plasma 40 times to a plasma center in Austin,
Texas, which in turn supplied Miles.
   The Texas man died of AIDS less than six weeks after his last
plasma sale in September 1983, the suit said.
   Jones contended in his suit that more than 60,000 vials of Koate
were contaminated with the AIDS virus because of the Texas man's
infection. He charged that Miles was negligent in acquiring and
using the infected plasma.
   Miles, in its appeal, denied any negligence.
   Bud Modersbach, the Berkeley, Calif., counsel for Cutter
Biologicals, the Miles division which manufactures Koate, said
Monday that the jury's decision was overruled because ``it was so
clear-cut.''
   Modersbach said the company had initiated a high-risk donor
screening program in February 1983, months before Jones took the
drug. And he said much less was known then about AIDS transmission
than is now known.
   He said the jury may have acted more on emotion than on the facts
in the trial.
   Judge Evans said in her ruling that Jones did not address Miles'
argument that he ``could just as well have gotten'' AIDS from other
blood factor products.
   George H. Connell Jr., Jones' attorney, said he planned to appeal
Judge Evans' ruling to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Jones, he said, ``is a pretty strong man. He thinks he's right and
wants to pursue the appeal.''
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is an usually-fatal
disease that strikes the body's immune system. As of Thursday,
79,389 cases had been reported in the United States since 1981,
according to federal health officials.

<HEAD>Not Quite The White House As Kremlin Press Plane Makes Debut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Ilyushin-62M aircraft that arrived here
resembles the one used by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Actually, it was the Kremlin's first ever press plane, dubbed by its
occupants, ``Glasnost One.''
   The Aeroflot charter touched down Monday at John F. Kennedy
International Airport, 24 hours ahead of the Soviet leader'
scheduled arrival. It will accompany Gorbachev throughout his trip
this week to New York, Havana and London.
   The caviar was black, Russian and better than the fare usually
found at 30,000 feet, but the inaugural flight of Glasnost One,
named after Gorbachev's policy of openness, had little else to
recommend it.
   The trip began at 6:30 a.m. Moscow time with dozens of
journalists shivering in the zero-degree darkness outside the Soviet
Foreign Ministry press center as they waited for the first of two
special buses to take them to the airport.
   It ended 20 hours later, at 6:30 p.m. EST, with 70 disgruntled
reporters, photographers and camera crews milling about outside the
United Nations, abandoned by their Soviet escorts with no passes to
enter the U.N. building, where Gorbachev is to address the General
Assembly on Wednesday.
   As might be expected on a first flight, Glasnost One had none of
the practiced perfection that has given the press corps that travels
aboard the White House press plane the reputation of a pampered
pack. There was no pocket-size printed schedule with every move
clocked to the minute, no ``spin doctors'' available to offer
precious background, no speech transcripts and, most important, no
accreditation, which the White House always arranges for those
traveling with it.
   Organized at the request of Moscow's foreign press corps, which
quickly discerned it could not keep up with Gorbachev by flying
commercial _ particularly since there is no direct service between
the United States and Cuba _ the flight offered the singular
advantage of speed.
   But with only one event, a news conference, scheduled for Monday,
the gang from Glasnost One missed it. Representatives of the
official Soviet press got there in plenty of time, however, by
taking the Pan Am nonstop two days before.
   For a fare of $4,880 _ foreign currency only, no rubles please _
the charter did provide relatively quick passage through the
notoriously slow-moving lines at Customs and Passport Control in
Moscow's Sheremetovo Airport.
   But the flight entailed a three-hour rest and refueling stop at
Gander, Newfoundland, and upon arrival at JFK, the plane taxied to a
remote revetment, where the passengers huddled beneath the belly of
the craft to claim each piece of luggage and camera gear before
loading their buses for the trip into Manhattan.
   With no schedule and none of their ``ministry minders''
disclosing any plans, no one realized until the buses crossed the
East River and turned north instead of south that they weren't
headed for the United Nations.
   As the buses pulled up not far from the Soviet Mission to the
United Nations, a tall thin Soviet escort who never gave his name
said he was going around the corner to get further instructions. He
returned several minutes later, saying he could find no one in
authority, everyone apparently having gone to the press conference
that was just about over blocks away at U.N. headquarters.
   He gave them a phone number to try later, then stepped off the
bus as it pulled away to take the weary mob to the United Nations,
which by then had closed.
   ``All the best!'' he said, and vanished into the night.

   Leftist insurgents attacked an
army brigade headquarters late Monday with mortars and assault
rifles and claimed to they killed or wounded 28 government soldiers.
   The attack occurred at the 3rd brigade's compound in the eastern
city of San Miguel. It was the third time this year that rebels have
struck a brigade headquarters.
   An officer reached by telephone at the brigade said a few mortar
rounds apparently fell inside the base perimeter but that damage
appeared slight. The officer, who refused to give his name, had no
information on possible casualties.
   The YSU radio station quoted military sources as saying two
mortar rounds fell inside brigade headquarters.
   The clandestine guerrilla Radio Venceremos said the attack killed
or wounded 28 soldiers from the 3rd brigade or from the elite Arce
Battalion, which is attached to the brigade.
   Guerrillas in recent months have tended to inflate their claims
of casualties inflicted on government forces.
   Authorities said the Marxist-led rebels, who have been at war
nine years with the U.S.-backed government, also destroyed with
incendiary bombs two stores in San Miguel, 85 miles east of the
capital.
   Army Col. Leon Linares, speaking by telephone with the YSU radio
station, said from San Miguel that three mortar rounds were fired at
the brigade and Arce sector. He did not indicate what damage they
may have caused.
   Linares said the 2{-hour attack was directed at civilian targets.
   Sporadic gunfire was heard in several parts of the city.
   The guerrillas, in their radio broadcast, said the attack was
part of an offensive dubbed ``Power and organization of the people
on its march toward insurrection.''
   The insurgents attacked the 6th brigade in Usulutan in February
and the 4th brigade in El Paraiso in September. Both those attacks
appeared to be larger than Monday's.

   The governing Liberal Party
announced that Carlos Flores Facuse, a newspaper editor and
industrial engineer, won its primary for the November 1989
presidential elections.
   ``I'm optimistic and ready to wage battle,'' Flores Facuse, 42,
said after Monday's announcement.
   Flores Facuse, editor of the newspaper La Tribuna, defeated three
opponents in nationwide balloting. He will face Rafael Callejas of
the conservative National Party, the only candidate in that party's
primary, which was also held Sunday.
   Callejas, 42, is an agricultural economist and previously served
as agriculture minister.
   Two smaller parties, the opposition Innovation and Christian
Democratic parties, plan to stage their own presidential primaries
on Feb. 5.
   Hondurans vote Nov. 26 to elect a president, three vice
presidents, 128 national legislators and 298 mayors.
   President Jose Azcona Hoyo, elected in 1985, is barred by the
Honduran constitution from running for a second term.
   The armed forces governed Honduras for nearly 20 years before a
return to civilian rule in 1982. The military still wields
considerable political power.

   Plutonium processing could resume by late
January at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant in Colorado, an
Energy Department spokesman said Monday.
   DOE shut down the main plutonium processing room at the plant
Oct. 8 because of a safety violation.
   Officials hope the plant's operator, Rockwell International
Corp., will have a startup plan by mid-January, said Rich Marquez, a
spokesman for the DOE's Albuquerque operations office, which
oversees the plant 16 miles northwest of Denver.
   The Energy Department then would review the plan and inspect the
plant, Marquez said, adding that the plutonium processing then could
be restarted by late January.
   ``It's critical to reopen the facility, but it's equally critical
that it be done right,'' Marquez said, adding that the Energy
Department has not had a specific schedule for reopening.
   The plant was shut down in response to a Sept. 29 incident in
which an Energy Department inspector and two Rockwell employees
entered a room in which workers were cleaning up radioactive
contamination, officials said.
   Officials said the workers in the room were wearing protective
clothing and masks, but the inspector and two Rockwell employees
were not because a warning sign was blocked from view. Energy
officials said two of them tested positive for contamination, but
the situation was not viewed as life-threatening.
   Marquez said Rockwell has been cleaning up the facility,
measuring the level of radiation in the building and working on any
needed modifications to procedures as part of its reopening plan.
   The reopening could be put off until February or March, he said,
adding, ``Up to now, things are progressing as they should.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Differing Opinions on Whether INF Made World
Safer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists
celebrated the signing of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces
treaty last year by turning ``the clock back to six minutes to
midnight,'' a step back from the brink of apocalypse.
   The symbolic clock, the anti-nuclear publication said, had
previously been even closer to nuclear destruction: at three minutes
to midnight.
   But on the eve of the fifth meeting between President Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, experts differ on whether the
INF pact actually made the world a safer place to live.
   President-elect George Bush, who will participate in the
Reagan-Gorbachev meeting, hopes to expand on the INF treaty as he
eventually engages Gorbachev in negotiations on strategic nuclear
forces and conventional armies in Europe.
   The INF pact was a milestone: it was the first U.S.-Soviet arms
control deal since the second Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty,
signed in 1979.
   It was the first treaty to eliminate an entire class of newly
developed weapons. Other arms treaties had merely set ceilings that
led to the elimination of some obsolete systems.
   ``After so many steps in the wrong direction, the INF Treaty is a
step in the right one,'' the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists said.
``For the first time the United States and the Soviet Union have
agreed to dismantle and ban a whole category of nuclear weapons.''
   Rep. Les Aspin, R-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said the INF pact pushed the Atlantic Alliance ``down the
slippery slope toward European denuclearization.''
   But former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said ``the Soviet
cuts do not reduce in any significant manner the Soviet capacity to
attack Europe with nuclear weapons and ... increase the Soviet
conventional threat to Europe'' because the Warsaw Pact has more
tanks and ground troops that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Kissinger said Gorbachev wanted the treaty for ``the calculated
purpose of weakening ties between the United States and Western
Europe and between Germany and the Atlantic Alliance.''
   Joseph Nye, a Harvard University professor who was a principal
foreign policy adviser to Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis, said ``the INF treaty in and of itself is not terribly
significant. Eliminating that number of weapons, 4 percent of the
total (of all nuclear arms), is not a major accomplishment.''
   ``The significance is more political, symbolizing the ability of
the two nations to get together,'' said Nye. ``In that sense, the
treaty left the world a safer place because it was a step toward
joint management of nuclear weapons.''
   The INF pact, ratified by the U.S. Senate and the Soviet
parliament in May and formally exchanged at the Moscow summit last
summer, called for the United States and the Soviet Union to destroy
all their ground-based missiles with ranges of 300-3,400 miles _ 859
weapons for America and 1,836 for the Soviet Union. It does not
apply to air- or sea-launched nuclear missiles in this range
category.
   More is going on under INF than missile crunching.
   The Soviet and U.S. missiles are being withdrawn and destroyed
under the watchful eyes of teams of inspectors composed largely of
military officers from the two superpowers.
   The trust engendered by those contacts is softening the attitudes
of some hard-line officers, veterans of the Cold War who have been
thrust to the forefront of the East-West thaw.
   The U.S. On-Site Inspection Agency is headed by Brig. Gen. Roland
Lajoie, a no-nonsense officer who served two tours as a military
attache in Moscow and was commander of the military liaison office
in East Germany when Soviet soldiers shot and killed U.S. Maj.
Arthur Nicholson on March 24, 1985.
   ``Clearly there was a considerable change in our relationship''
since the INF pact was signed, Lajoie said last summer. Much of the
suspicion, he said ``is gone now.''
   Lajoie also marveled at being able to go to a base for the main
Soviet medium-range missile, the SS-20. ``That is something I would
never have dreamed I could do as a military attache. ... That in
itself is a startling development,'' he said.
   John D. Steinbruner, director of foreign policy studies at the
liberal Brookings Institution, says Gorbachev should get the credit
for pushing along U.S.-Soviet relations.
   The superpower leaders, said Steinbruner, ``have set a
constructive trend. But it has not yet gone far enough to say that
the world is a safer place.''
   He added, ``There is a policy emerging from the Kremlin that, if
carried out, would make the world a safer place.''
   Bruce Weinrod, director of foreign policy studies at the
conservative Heritage Foundation, credits the tough policies of
Reagan for driving the Soviet Union toward equitable arms control
deals.
   ``With Gorbachev, the jury is still out. He has certainly created
more space inside his country for discussion. ... But it is not
clear how far the internal loosening will go,'' Weinrod said.

<HEAD>Study Says 680 Plants At Risk Of Extinction Before Turn Of Century</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Nearly 700 plant species in the United States
face extinction by the year 2000, and those in rapidly developing
parts of the nation are at particular risk, a conservation group
says.
   The private Center for Plant Conservation said 73 percent of the
plants facing extinction are in southerly, subtropical regions with
intense economic or population growth _ Hawaii, California, Texas,
Florida and Puerto Rico.
   ``The causes of extinction are by now quite familiar to us _
destruction of habitat, population growth, urban, suburban and
industrial sprawl, irresponsible resource extraction, overuse of
public land,'' Donald Falk, the center's executive director, said
Monday. ``A consequence of that is this tremendously accelerated
rate of extinction that we're seeing in these priority regions.''
   Falk said some of the endangered plants are relatives of
important timber products, food groups, or plants used in
horticulture and landscaping.
   The center's 1{-year study found that 253 species may become
extinct within five years and another 427 may vanish by the turn of
the century. As many as 52 of the plant species may already be
extinct in the wild.
   The center is a consortium of 19 botanical gardens and arboreta
headquartered in Boston.
   ``What we're dealing with here is just another sign of a planet
in trouble and indeed, a national environment in trouble,'' said
Thomas Lovejoy, an expert on tropical rain forests and assistant
secretary for external affairs at the Smithsonian Institution.
   At least 200 kinds of plants already have become extinct during
the past two centuries, experts generally agree, and
conservationists worry that the rate may accelerate as population
and economic growth jeopardize habitats. A 1973 study by the
Smithsonian found that 3,000 of the nation's 25,000 species are
endangered.
   ``Working with endangered species means working against the
clock,'' Falk said at a news conference at the Smithsonian. ``It's
kind of like being in the emergency room all the time.''
   Falk said it would cost $10 million to $15 million to protect and
propagate all 680 of the threatened plants, $6 million to $7 million
to target only those in the priority areas, or $3 million to $4
million to save only plants facing extinction within five years.
   ``Every species lost represents an irretrievable loss of
biological diversity and potential ecological values and potential
human values,'' Falk said. ``Once a species goes extinct, you can't
then change your mind. You can't then say ... that species was
beautiful, or that might have helped medicine or that species might
have been scientifically interesting or might have been ecologically
significant. You don't get a second chance with endangered species.''

<HEAD>Lawmaker Sees No Major Trade Deal At Montreal Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This week's trade talks in Montreal are
unlikely to result in any major new agreement to reduce agriculture
subsidies around the world, says one farm lawmaker, and that could
lead Congress to take an even harder line when writing the next
generation of U.S. agriculture law.
   ``A major agriculture accord in Montreal ... is not going to
happen,'' said Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., chairman of the House
Agriculture grains subcommittee. Glickman spent two days in Montreal
talking with negotiators before the talks opened Monday.
   But unless the 12-nation European Community, the major U.S. foe
on the farm-subsidy issue, makes strides toward an eventual
elimination of subsidies, ``the 1990 farm bill will take an
assertive, aggressive and rather combative attitude,'' Glickman
predicted.
   Other farm lawmakers in Montreal to observe the talks, including
Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., have
been pushing the same message.
   ``I got the clear feeling that the EC is not terribly interested
in negotiating away their unfair trade subsidies,'' he said. ``They
are going into the next two years with a very hard-line attitude.''
   The EC contends that its farm subsidies are not unfair to other
trading nations, and it has said it would be willing to scale back
such government assistance programs if proportional cutbacks also
were made by other major trading countries.
   Glickman said the dispute makes it important that the United
States continue to give strong emphasis to export subsidies _ many
of which were devised to counter similar subsidies by the EC _ and
not let them fall victim to the budget knife in the Congress that
convenes in January.
   ``Agriculture is going to have to share in these budget cuts,''
he said. ``But there are a variety of ways agriculture can cope''
with having less money. ``We have to protect (export subsidy)
spending, or the EC will eat our lunch.''
   The dispute over how to handle agricultural subsidies was at the
top of the agenda as the 96 signatory nations to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade met in Montreal. Failure to reach an
accord on how to handle the subsidies issue threatened to stymie
progress in other trade areas.
   The United States is pressing for an end to all farm subsidies on
a definite timetable. That would be advantageous to the 2 million or
so U.S. commercial farmers because they are larger-scale and more
efficient producers.
   But for the EC, which has for years heavily subsidized its 11
million-plus farm producers, it would be politically impossible to
eliminate all farm support payments.
   The chief U.S. agriculture negotiator, Daniel Amstutz, said the
United States had moved away from setting a deadline of the year
2000 for elimination of subsidies. ``We're flexible,'' he said, but
``we'd rather not have any agreement than a bad one.''

   The Agriculture Department released a new
outlook report indicating U.S. farm exports are expected to continue
to climb in the current fiscal year, growing by $1 billion to a
total of $36.5 billion.
   A $2.5 billion rise in grain and feed shipments will more than
offset declines in the value of cotton and oilseed exports, the
department projected.
   Agricultural imports, meanwhile, were expected to match the
fiscal 1988 record of $21 billion, meaning an overall increase of $1
billion in the U.S. farm trade surplus, to $15.5 billion.

   A study by the International Monetary Fund has
strongly criticized the joint farm policies of the 12 governments in
the European Community.
   ``The basic mistake ... is the belief that stable and adequate
incomes for farmers can be achieved through agricultural price
support,'' the study said.
   ``As historical experience has vividly demonstrated, this
instrument is neither effective nor efficient.''
   It added that the system has brought windfall gains to efficient,
large-scale European farmers and has not given adequate income to
small ones.
   The study, ``The Common Agricultural Policy of the European
Community,'' was written by six experts of the Fund, which is owned
by 151 governments.
   European farmers get protection from foreign competition by a
system of variable levies on imports. These are customs duties that
rise and fall with world prices, payable by European importers so
that domestic products are cheaper to European consumers at any
given moment. Farmers also benefit from price supports to keep their
incomes relatively high. This system helped Western Europe become
self-sufficient in food after World War II, but in recent years it
has encouraged the creation of huge product surpluses.
   The community has a problem in exporting its surpluses and uses
European tax money to subsidize the sales and to pay the enormous
cost of storing the excess.
   The U.S. government also uses price supports to keep farmers'
incomes high, restricts imports and thus creates surpluses. It also
uses tax money to subsidize exports, but according to the fund's
figures the Europeans have increased their share of the world's
export trade in farm products in recent years.

<HEAD>High Court to Consider Whether Punitive Damage Awards Excessive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Businesses that are the target of lawsuits
seeking big payoffs from ``deep pockets'' are getting a Supreme
Court hearing in their challenge to multimillion-dollar punitive
damage awards.
   The justices said Monday they will decide whether such awards
violate a constitutional ban against excessive fines.
   A ruling, expected by July, could determine the future of a
growing trend in U.S. courtrooms that has sparked legislative debate
nationwide. At stake are huge sums of money awarded in a wide
variety of lawsuits.
   The high court, which failed in the past to resolve the question,
will tackle the issue in an appeal by a Texas-based waste collection
company ordered to pay $6 million to a Vermont competitor.
   A number of business groups, including the National Association
of Manufacturers, say the situation is critical.
   Because of their ``deep pockets,'' manufacturers are bearing
``the brunt of a massive and discriminatory increase in
punitive-damages verdicts,'' the association said.
   The term punitive damages applies to awards aimed at both
punishing and deterring misconduct.
   One of the questions confronting the high court is whether
punitive damages must bear any specific relationship to compensatory
damages awarded for actual injuries.
   The high court in May declined to decide the constitutionality of
very large punitive-damage awards. In that case, it upheld on
narrow, procedural grounds a $1.8 million judgment against an
insurance company that wrongfully rejected a $20,000 claim.
   Left unresolved was the legitimacy of skyrocketing
punitive-damage awards, a development that has touched off a wave of
legislative activity, often called ``tort reform.''
   Some states, reacting to soaring insurance premiums and pleas
from the industry, have imposed ceilings on punitive damages.
   A recent federal study cited ``explosive growth'' in damage
awards. It said, for example, that the average jury award for
medical malpractice leaped 2,000 percent from 1960 to 1984 _ from
$52,000 to $1.2 million with adjustment for inflation. Jury awards
in some product-liability cases increased more than tenfold to
average $1.1 million, the study said.
   The court will address the issue by reviewing a decision by the
2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in April that upheld a $6 million
award against Browning-Ferris Industries Inc. of Houston.
   The appeals court said that while the actual damages in the case
were around $100,000, ``We do not think the (punitive) damages here
were so disproportionate as to be cruel, unusual or constitutionally
excessive.''
   Browning-Ferris decided in 1973 to enter the waste disposal
business in Burlington, Vt. The company appointed Joseph Kelley to
be district manager for its new regional office.
   Kelley left Browning-Ferris in 1980 to form his own company,
Kelco Disposal Inc., which captured more than 40 percent of the
market in the Burlington region by 1982.
   Browning-Ferris, according to testimony in the case, then
instructed its new Burlington manager to ``put Kelley out of
business. Do whatever it takes. Squish him like a bug.''
   Browning-Ferris then cut its prices almost in half. Kelley
contended the price-cutting maneuver was a ``predatory'' violation
of antitrust law to drive him out of business and permit
Browning-Ferris to create a monopoly.
   Browning-Ferris' market share in the Burlington area declined
sharply from 1980 to 1982, but remained fairly stable from 1982 to
1984 after it cut prices.
   Kelco captured a 56 percent market share by 1985 and remained in
business.
   In other action, the court:
   _Agreed to decide whether a federal law allowing public scrutiny
of governmental advisory groups applies to the American Bar
Association's role in selecting federal judges.
   _Agreed in a case from Alabama to hear a Reagan administration
appeal aimed at limiting recovery of lawyers' fees for people who
win disputes with the government over Social Security benefits.
   _Refused to revive a $70,000 award to a Tennessee woman who said
her rights were violated in a dispute with public school officials
over what she claimed were ``godless'' textbooks.
   _Refused in a California case to bar police from conducting
roadside sobriety tests by setting up checkpoints at unannounced
locations.
   _Barred a New Hampshire community from removing poles bearing
sirens that could alert townspeople about an accident at the
Seabrook nuclear power plant.

<HEAD>Attacks On Americans Reported On Rise</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Terrorist acts against Americans have increased
sharply this year, although the number of casualties has fallen, the
State Department said.
   The department also reported Monday that terrorism worldwide is
rising.
   Incidents directed against Americans in the first nine months of
this year rose to 157 from 108 in the corresponding period last
year, it said. Three Americans were killed and 25 injured, compared
with one death and 38 wounded in the earlier period.
   Almost half of the attacks on Americans this year were bombings
of U.S. oil company property in Colombia. No one was killed in these
incidents.
   The three American deaths were in Greece, Italy and Peru.
   Terrorist incidents worldwide totaled 680 in the first nine
months of this year, up from 655 in the same period last year. The
number of casualties declined, however, to 278 killed and 875
wounded, from the year-earlier total of 443 killed and 2,014 injured.
   Increases in terrorist acts in Asia, Latin America and Africa
outweighed declines in Western Europe and other areas.
   An increase in Asia _ to 155 incidents from 130 _ was due largely
to South Korea, which reported no international attacks in the first
nine months of last year but 10 in 1988. These were mostly attacks
against U.S. offices in Seoul.
   In Western Europe, terrorist incidents linked to events in the
Middle East were down to 20 from 35 a year ago. Terrorist attacks of
other types in Western Europe rose to 83 from 82.

<HEAD>House Leaders Put Focus On Campaign Reform For 1989</HEAD>

   The House Democratic and Republican leaders are
putting election campaign reform high on their 1989 agendas, but
they are disagreeing over whether House members need stricter ethics
standards.
   Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and Minority Leader Bob Michel,
R-Ill., both are calling for changes in a system that is successful
for incumbents: voters last month re-elected 402 of the 408 House
members seeking new terms.
   ``We'll pass clean elections legislation,'' Wright told his
Democratic colleagues Monday after they unanimously voted to give
him a second two-year term as the House's top official.
   The only specific change he mentioned, however, was a law setting
a simultaneous poll closing time around the nation, which advocates
see as a way of preventing voting in the West from being influenced
by results in the East.
   Michel, whose party has had difficulty cutting into the 260-175
Democratic bulge in the House, made no specific election proposals
as he called for Wright to join in forming a bipartisan task force
to ``fashion reforms of (House) ethics standards, outside income and
campaign practices.''
   Michel made the call as he was unanimously elected by the
Republicans to his fifth two-year term as their leader. His speech
put far more emphasis on ethics than on campaign reform, an issue
that Congress has grappled with unsuccessfully for a decade.
   ``The record of (ethics) enforcement in this House is a national
disgrace,'' said Michel, who referred to no specific cases. ``We
must more clearly define our ethics rules and then we have to
enforce them. ... The time for reform is here.''
   Wright, meeting with reporters later in the day, disagreed with
Michel's assessment on ethics but offered to discuss the issues with
him.
   ``For the most part, members of the House ... are decent,
responsible and ethical people,'' said Wright, whose personal
finances and possible divulging of government secrets are under
investigation by the House ethics committee. He has denied any
wrongdoing.
   In his acceptance speech, Wright said the House in the 101st
Congress would approve a new Clean Air Act and would work to ``clean
up those areas of our business practices where management needs
regulation.''
   He cited the disappearance of banks, corporations and farms in
economic reshufflings and leveraged buyouts that ``intensify and
concentrate economic wealth in fewer and fewer hands.''
   In the separate party meetings, two women House members lost bids
to crack the all-male top leadership ranks.
   On the Republican side, Rep. Lynn Martin of Illinois came up four
votes short of beating Rep. Jerry Lewis of California for chairman
of the House Republican Conference, the No. 3 GOP leadership post.
   Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, was defeated easily by Rep. William
Gray, D-Pa., for chairmanship of the House Democratic Caucus, the
No. 4 job in the Democratic hierarchy. He replaces Rep. Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo.
   Gray's election marked the first time a black House member had
advanced this high on a leadership ladder that traditionally has led
to the speaker's office. He earned high marks over the past four
years as Budget Committee chairman, a pivotal House post that
carries a two-term limit.
   Gray said he was proud of his racial heritage but was not elected
because of it.
   He said he hoped to be a role model to blacks ``to show them you
ought to strive, you ought to work, you ought to aim high. ... But
as chairman of the Democratic Caucus, I will represent the interests
of the entire Democratic party.''
   The rest of the leadership races were uncontested and were filled
by acclamation.
   Rep. Tom Foley, D-Wash., was given a second term as House
majority leader, while Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., won his second
two-year stint as majority whip, the No. 3 Democratic post.
   Rep. Dick Cheney, R-Wyo., moved into the No. 2 GOP job of
minority whip, succeeding Rep. Trent Lott, R-Miss., who was elected
to the Senate last month.

<HEAD>Longterm Studies Show Drug Erases Wrinkles of Aging</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Studies lasting almost two years have confirmed
earlier findings that tretinoin, a vitamin A acid derivative, is
able to help smooth skin wrinkles and repair some damage of aging
and sunlight exposure.
   Dr. John J. Voorhees of the University of Michigan Medical School
said Monday that use of tretinoin cream on a small group of patients
over 22 months has shown the drug can cause the skin to repair some
of the marks left by time and to erase some blemishes.
   ``Whatever type of wrinkling that has occurred, treatment from
(tretinoin) will improve,'' Voorhees said in a report at the annual
meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology.
   In a report published last January in the Journal of the American
Medical Association, Voorhees said that a four-month study using
tretinoin cream caused fine skin wrinkles to disappear on the face
and arms.
   He said Monday that study has now been extended to 22 months and
that 21 patients have remained in the experiment from the beginning.
   Careful photographic analysis of treated areas of the skin on the
arms and face, he said, have shown that the drug has erased many
fine wrinkles, caused a lightening of so-called liver spots and
caused improvements in deep wrinkles, skin sagging and droopy
eyelids.
   Voorhees said examination of skin samples by electron microscope
shows that skin treated with tretinoin develops new collagen fiber,
a natural substance that lends elasticity to the skin and helps
prevent wrinkles. He said the sample skin also showed that blood
vessels are dilated, which helps improve skin color, and that the
skin actually thickens.
   The continuing studies, said Voorhees, shows ``the longer you use
it, the better it works.''
   In another study, James J. Leyden of the University of
Pennsylvania said he assessed the drug in a double blind study using
40 patients, half of whom received tretinoin cream, and half
received cream without the drug.
   To measure the precise effect, silicone molds were taken of the
``laugh line'' area around the eyes of the patients. These molds
were analyzed by computer and the wrinkles were given numerical
values. At the end of six months, more molds were made.
   Leyden said those who received the tretinoin cream showed a 32
percent reduction in fine wrinkles and a 22 percent reduction in
deeper skin furrows.
   Dr. Barbara A. Gilchrest of Boston University School of Medicine
said the application of tretinoin, a vitamin A acid derivative, has
been shown in studies to reduce the number and size of skin lesions
called actinic keratoses.
   Dr. Barbara A. Gilchrest of Boston University School of Medicine
said tretinoin ``is the most exciting thing to happen in the field
of skin aging in this century. It allows for the possibility that
some aspects of skin aging can be reversed.''
   But she added that the drug is only for those who are willing to
put up with ``weeks or even months of soreness or peeling'' to
achieve skin improvements that may be slow and ``subtle.''
   ``I tell patients not to expect miracles, and that the changes
will be subtle,'' she said. ``The benefits, as we understand them
now, will be largely cosmetic.''
   Gilchrest said preliminary findings in year-long studies at 10
medical centers shows that tretinoin acts on cells in the actinic
keratoses lesions to prevent them from turning into cancer.
Precisely how the drug works, she said, is not understood.
   But she said the findings suggest that tretinoin, in addition to
correcting skin wrinkling, also may help prevent a common type of
skin cancer.
   Actinic keratoses are dry, scaly spots on the skin that don't
heal normally and can sometimes develop into squamous cell
carcinoma, a type of skin cancer.
   Tretinoin, which is marketed by Ortho Pharmaceuticals under the
brand name Retin-A, is authorized by the Food and Drug
Administration for the treatment of acne. The drug has been used
experimentally for the treatment of aging, but has not yet been
approved by the FDA for that use.
   Voorhees said studies now are under way directed toward clearing
tretinoin for the treatment of wrinkles and other skin damage caused
by exposure to sunlight.
   Albert M. Kligman, a University of Pennsylvania professor who
first reported the anti-wrinkling effects of tretinoin, said he
believes that patients who want the full benefits of the drug ``must
make a lifelong commitment'' to applying the cream at least three
times weekly to get its full benefit.
   He said patients ``can go to a minimum dosage'' after one or two
years using the cream and that this will continue to prevent the
skin aging.
   Voorhees said the cost of Retin-A, which can sold only with a
perscription, is about $14.50 for a month's supply.

<HEAD>US Denies Existence of Joint Covert Action Agreement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House and State Department are
presenting a united front in denying that the United States and
Israel had an agreement to conduct joint covert operations against
terrorists.
   Congressional sources said that if there were such a compact _ as
alleged by a former Israeli official _ the Reagan administration
never told lawmakers about it. Reagan never signed any such
agreement, his spokesman said Monday.
   The denials were prompted by a weekend news story which said such
a U.S.-Israeli agreement had been revealed by former Israeli
official Amiram Nir.
   In Jerusalem, the office of Foreign Minister Shimon Peres also
denied the report in The Washington Post, saying, ``There is no such
agreement.'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel declined to
elaborate.
   Nir, a prominent figure in the Iran-Contra affair, said in June
that a compact allowed such covert operations, which he said he
supervised with then-National Security Council aide Oliver L. North,
the newspaper said.
   The Post reported Nir's assertions in its Sunday editions, four
days after the 37-year-old former Israeli counterterrorism official
was killed in the crash of a light plane in Mexico.
   North is charged with a variety of offenses including conspiracy
and illegal diversion of millions of dollars in government money.
The charges center on the Reagan administration's clandestine sales
of U.S. arms to Iran in 1985-86 and subsequent diversion of proceeds
to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. North is scheduled to stand trial
in late January.
   Nir said in June the agreement authorized still-secret operations
that he and North supervised in 1985-86, the Post said.
   It said American and Israeli sources confirmed the existence of
the Israeli-American agreement, referred to as ``terms of
reference'' or ``accords'' by some sources.
   Sources at the House and Senate Intelligence committees said
Monday no such agreement had been reported to Congress.
   ``It is a serious allegation that there exists an agreement to
engage in covert actions that would not be reported to Congress,''
said one source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The law requires that any covert action be carried out only after
it is authorized in a ``finding'' signed by the president which
states why the activity is in the national security interest. Such
findings are supposed to be reported to congressional review
committees on a timely basis.
   Asked whether such an agreement existed, presidential spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater replied, ``The bottom line is that we don't believe
there is one.''
   He said White House officials checked with various agencies that
might have been involved and could find no record of such an
agreement.
   Fitzwater said Reagan ``never executed any umbrella agreement or
accord such as the one described ... and we're not aware of the
existence of any document fitting that description.''
   At the State Department, spokesman Charles E. Redman echoed
Fitzwater. ``We've done some more research, and I can say no such
agreement as discussed in that Post story exists, or existed,'' he
said.
   However, he said the United States shared information on
terrorism with Israel.
   ``We do know, and this may be, perhaps, at the root of that
story, that Mr. Nir in his capacity in the Israeli government did
propose a more formal agreement, or memorandum of agreement in the
time period of September and October 1985,'' Redman said. ``But that
proposal was immediately rejected by the United States government.''

<HEAD>Nobel Winner Said to Regain Some Memory with Alzheimer Drug</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 78-year-old Nobel Prize-winning chemist, Archer
Martin, has regained some of his memory after taking an experimental
drug for Alzheimer's disease, his wife says.
   ``I get the feeling that I can think again,'' Martin was quoted
in a front-page report in the Sunday Times as saying.
   Professor Raymond Levy, in whose tests Martin participated,
cautioned that the drug treats the symptoms, not the disease, and is
``unlikely to be a cure in any sense.''
   Martin was one of the first volunteers when tests of the drug
tetrahydroaminoacridine, or THA, began at London's Institute of
Psychiatry in March, and his condition improved immediately, his
wife Judith said Monday.
   ``He responded, not miraculously, but there was certainly a
reduction in the deterioration which was immediately noticeable,''
she told British Broadcasting Corp. radio from the couple's
Cambridge home.
   ``He didn't have attacks or irritability nearly so often. It
certainly appeared encouraging from fairly early on.''
   Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, irreversible neurological
disease with no known cause or cure. Victims, mostly elderly people,
suffer gradual memory loss, disorientation and personality changes.
   Levy, who is conducting the trials, told The Associated Press
that THA is not a cure.
   ``It doesn't reverse the process and I think it's unlikely to be
a cure in any sense,'' he said. ``It's dealing with symptoms,
really, rather than the basic cause of the disease.''
   Levy, a professor of old-age psychiatry, said THA seems to
preserve a chemical messenger called acetylcholine that helps
control memory.
   However, brain cells die as Alzheimer's disease progresses and a
drug such as THA can work only as long as there are enough living
cells to produce sufficient levels of acetylcholine.
   Martin, a biochemist, won the Nobel Prize in 1952 for his work on
chromatography, a method of separating chemical substances. His
discoveries transformed chemistry and are still widely used in
medicine and industry.
   Mrs. Martin said her husband began losing his memory four years
ago and could not work because he forgot everything he read.
   THA has side-effects, including a risk of liver damage, but Mrs.
Martin said: ``As a scientist and as a scientist's wife, we are both
well-equipped to observe anything that might be going wrong.''
   Other side effects reported from THA experiments include nausea,
vomiting and allergic reactions.
   The drug hit the headlines in 1986 with a report of effectiveness
by a California investigator. But this year, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration said it found ``numerous statements'' in the report
that appeared to be false, and that the investigator ``repeatedly or
deliberately'' violated regulations on proper conduct of testing
drugs.
   THA now is being studied in followup research in the United
States.
   Levy said 32 people are involved in his trials. He said the drug
produced ``staggering'' results in three of the first volunteers,
including a potter who was able to return to her craft. But it also
produced no results in three other early volunteers, he said.
   Martin declined to be interviewed Monday, but The Sunday Times
said he was able to give lengthy explanations of enzyme activity and
its relation to the release of energy for mental activity.

<HEAD>Environmental Group Seeks To Halt Chemical Warfare Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An environmental group's lawsuit to stop the
Defense Department's chemical and biological weapons research and
production accuses the Pentagon of ``recklessly endangering'' the
lives of military and civilian populations.
   A central assertion of the suit filed Monday in U.S. District
Court by the Foundation on Economic Trends is that the Pentagon has
greatly expanded the scope of such weapons programs without fully
studying their effects on people and communities.
   The production and storage of chemical agents ``present immediate
and potentially catastrophic environmental and human health hazards
to local communities and populations,'' and yet the Pentagon has
taken a cavalier attitude toward public safety, the suit charges.
   The suit requests preliminary and permanent injunctions until the
Pentagon and armed services conduct detailed environmental studies
of every phase of their chemical warfare programs.
   ``The dramatic increase in the Pentagon's chemical warfare
program has placed communities across the country at risk,'' charged
Jeremy Rifkin, the president of the Washington-based foundation.
   ``The Defense Department is recklessly endangering laboratory
workers, military personnel and the general public in communities
where chemical warfare laboratories and storage facilities are
located,'' the suit said.
   The service declined to comment Monday on the foundation's suit,
saying it still was studying the matter, but insisted in a statement
it was ``committed to both the environment and public safety.''
   To buttress its case, the foundation filed with the court a copy
of an Army inspector general's evaluation of chemical safety
procedures, completed this spring and first disclosed on Capitol
Hill this summer.
   The Army is by far the largest service when it comes to
responsibility for chemical and biological warfare research.
   The internal audit concluded the Army had not assigned enough
people to chemical safety programs, ``with expertise only `one deep'
in most instances.''
   It also found ``there is not an effective oversight program in
place for chemical safety; that chemical safety has slipped through
a crack.''
   The Army previously had responded to the inspector general's
audit by ordering improvements and a new study to ``evaluate
adequacy of staffing for chemical safety at all levels.''
   The Foundation on Economic Trends is an environmental group that
long has focused its attention on the dangers of biological research
and genetic engineering.
   The United States, citing production by the Soviet Union,
recently began making a new generation of toxic chemical weapons. On
the biological front _ using live, deadly organisms as a weapon _
the United States has committed itself by international treaty not
to develop new weapons, but still conducts research to develop
vaccines and antidotes, detection systems and defensive battlefield
gear.
   The foundation alleges that the Pentagon has so dramatically
increased the funding and scope of its chemical and biological
programs _ with appropriations rising 600 percent since fiscal 1980
to more than $271 million _ that it is required to study
environmental impacts even though the programs may be ongoing.
   ``Given the exponential growth in size and scope of the chemical
warfare program ... the defendants cannot validly exclude those
programs from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy
Act,'' the suit asserts.

<HEAD>Former LaRouche Aide Says Debts Had Quadrupled</HEAD>

   A former finance officer for Lyndon H.
LaRouche Jr. says the political maverick's debts quadrupled to $40
million within one year because of heavy new borrowing on top of old
loans that weren't being repaid as promised.
   Wayne Hintz said he eventually quit his job of trying to ``crisis
manage'' LaRouche's fast-growing debt in 1986.
   Hintz testified Monday at the start of the third week of
LaRouche's mail and tax fraud conspiracy trial in U.S. District
Court.
   Prosecutors said they probably would complete their case against
LaRouche today. Lawyers for the perennial presidential candidate say
they haven't decided whether to summon LaRouche to testify in his
own defense.
   LaRouche and six associates are charged with mail fraud and
conspiracy for allegedly raising more than $30 million in loans with
no intention of repaying them.
   In addition, LaRouche was charged with conspiring to defraud the
Internal Revenue Service by having all his personal expenses paid by
various corporations he controls and not filing any income tax
returns since 1978.
   If convicted on all 13 counts against him, LaRouche would face a
maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and fines totaling $3.25
million.
   In a separate case scheduled for retrial in Boston on Jan. 3,
LaRouche is charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice in
connection with alleged unauthorized use of credit cards by 18 of
his followers to raise $1 million for his 1984 presidential campaign.
   Hintz told the federal trial jury here Monday that despite a
promise by higher-ups to allocate $80,000 a week to pay off old
loans, ``we had become increasingly behind in debt'' by the end of
1985.
   He estimated that the LaRouche organization's total debt early
that year was about $10 million owed to 2,000 lenders. But because
new loans were being made and old ones weren't being repaid, the
debt had swollen to $40 million by year's end.
   The promised $80,000 a week actually was allocated only once, he
said, and the average made available for retiring debt was less than
half that amount.
   He said it would have taken $69,000 a week just to pay the
interest on new loans.
   Steven Bardwell of Hastings on Hudson, N.Y., former editor of a
LaRouche magazine called Fusions, testified Monday that LaRouche
exhorted his followers to raise large sums to help him save humanity
from nuclear war.
   The first priority for spending money raised from loans and
contributions was to guarantee LaRouche's security against possible
assassination attempts, said Bardwell.
   He said LaRouche berated fund-raisers who failed to meet their
quotas by accusing them of suffering ``sexual impotence.''
   Bardwell said that after he quit the LaRouche organization in
1984 over a defense policy dispute with LaRouche, he hosted a
Halloween party for former LaRouche employees such as himself.
   One guest wore a pig snout, and another came dressed as the
Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran. But the party was less than a success,
Bardwell said.
   Bardwell suggested they play ``Pin the Rap on Lyndon.'' But he
said Monday that ``not many people thought that was funny.''
   Even worse, he said, a gate-crasher who still worked for LaRouche
came dressed as an AIDS virus, enjoyed the party and then tattled to
his superiors.
   ``I thought it was very rude to come to my party and drink my
liquor and eat my food and then go back and report on it,'' Bardwell
said.

   Dick York, who played the often-frustrated
husband Darren Stevens to Elizabeth Montgomery's Samantha in the
1960s TV comedy ``Bewitched,'' is conjuring up a little magic of his
own to help the needy.
   ``I'm ready to fight city hall and scream and yell about
everything,'' York, 60, said recently. ``It seems to me, when
somebody's hungry, you feed them. If they don't have a place to
live, you find them a place to live.''
   York has raised thousands of dollars and donated items to the
homeless and the hungry through his ``Acting for Life'' concern. He
has headed the effort despite his fight against incurable emphysema
and a degenerative spinal disease that confines him to his home.
   ``There's no sense grieving about it. The pain is there anyway,
(but) I can't turn my back on other people. I've been there.
   ``I saw the look on my mother's face when she had to give us
second-hand Christmas presents,'' York said. ``That's how you learn
to act. Because you don't want your parents to know you know.''

   Former White House aide Oliver North

``American family life,'' the casino's entertainment director says.
   ``A lot of people want to hear the guy,'' said director Jay
Venetianer. ``He did make a big impression on the American people
during the televised hearings into the Iran-Contra affair.''
   North will speak at a Feb. 11 party for the casino's invited

North's fee, saying it's ``nobody's business.''
   ``The Sands has developed a policy of occasionally presenting
non-performing entertainment attractions, and this booking fits
squarely into that category,'' Venetianer said.
   The retired Marine probably won't discuss his pending federal
trial on charges that he diverted money from U.S. arms sales to Iran

   The Navy is bestowing its highest civilian
award on TWA flight attendant Ulrike ``Uli'' Derickson for
protecting American passengers from Arab hijackers three years ago.
   Mrs. Derickson, who was chief flight attendant aboard TWA Flight
847 when it was hijacked on June 14, 1985, was to receive the Navy
Distinguished Public Service Award from Navy Secretary William L.
Ball III today.
   ``Her courageous and heroic efforts to support and protect the
passengers, including Petty Officers Robert Stethem and Clinton
Suggs, were in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S.
Navy,'' the Navy said Monday.
   Stethem, a Navy diver, was one of 39 Americans held captive for
17 days after the Athens-to-Rome flight was hijacked and taken to
Beirut. He was shot and killed by the hijackers despite Mrs.
Derickson's efforts to intervene on his behalf.
   Mrs. Derickson, who hid the passports of passengers with Jewish
sounding names, managed to stop the hijackers from beating Suggs.
   The Navy said Mrs. Derickson was to be accompanied at today's
ceremony by her husband and some of the U.S. sailors who survived
the hijacking.

   Home run king Hank Aaron verbally sparred with
Peter Ueberroth at baseball's winter meeting, dismissing as ``the
same old bull'' the commissioner's claim that minorities' management
opportunities have increased.
   ``There has been progress, but not enough in the front office and
management level,'' Aaron, executive vice president of the Atlanta
Braves, said Monday.
   ``There are more minorities being interviewed, but I don't see
them getting the job,'' he said. ``You see Joe Morgan, Bill
Robinson, Billy Williams. They're all qualified and deserve more
than just an interview.''
   Ueberroth, who will be succeeded by National League President
Bart Giamatti on April 1, said minority hiring had risen from 2
percent to 10 percent in two years. He expressed disappointment that
there weren't more minority managers, general managers and team
public relations workers, but said criticism that many new minority
hirings were in clerical jobs ``is a falsehood.''
   Aaron said Ueberroth's statement was ``the same old bull, just
dressed up a little bit. ... Most of those jobs (for non-whites) are
in the ticket department, and that's about it.''

<HEAD>DOE Says Rocky Flats Plant May Reopen By Late January</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Plutonium processing may be restarted by late
January at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant in Colorado, where
production was halted in October following a safety violation, a
federal energy official said.
   Rockwell International Corp., operator of the plant 16 miles
northwest of Denver, has been cleaning up radioactivity at the plant
and devising a startup plan, Rich Marquez, an Energy Department
spokesman in Albuquerque, N.M., said Monday.
   Federal officials hope Rockwell will complete its plan by
mid-January, Marquez said. The Energy Department then would review
the plan, suggest modifications and inspect the plant, Marquez said,
adding that the plutonium processing could resume by the end of
January.
   The DOE shut down the Rocky Flats plutonium processing building
on Oct. 8.
   ``It's critical to reopen the facility, but it's equally critical
that it be done right,'' Marquez said, adding that the Energy
Department has not set a specific schedule for reopening.
   The plant was shut down following a Sept. 29 incident in which an
Energy Department inspector and two Rockwell employees entered a
room where workers were cleaning up radioactive contamination,
officials said.
   The workers in the room were wearing protective clothing and
masks, but officials said the inspector and two Rockwell employees
were not because a warning sign was blocked from view. Two of them
tested positive for contamination, but the situation was not viewed
as life-threatening, federal officials said at the time.
   Marquez said Rockwell has been cleaning up the facility,
measuring the level of radiation in the building, and working on any
needed procedural modifications as part of its reopening plan.
   The Rocky Flats reopening could be delayed until February or
March, he said, but added, ``Up to now, things are progressing as
they should.''
   In the past few months, nuclear weapons production has ground to
a virtual halt following shutdown of the Rocky Flats plutonium
facility, the closure of three reactors at the Savannah River
complex near Aiken, S.C., and a strike that has shut down the Feed
Materials Production Center in Fernald, Ohio, since Oct. 17.
   Plutonium and tritium _ which is manufactured at Savannah River _
are needed to make nuclear weapons. Plutonium is plentiful, but
officials have said a tritium shortage could cause problems in the
next six to 24 months.
   Energy Department officials have set guidelines for restarting
the Savannah River Plant reactors, including unannounced inspections
and setting training and safety standards similar to those used for
commercial nuclear reactors. DOE Secretary John Herrington said last
week the department hopes to restart K-Reactor at Savannah by late
spring or early summer.

   Barry Faintich paid $50 for a dollar bill, and
he may have snagged a bargain.
   The 1985 dollar bill that caught his eye during a transaction at
his coin shop in nearby Clayton is a rarity because it bears no
Treasury Department seal, no district seal and no serial number.
   A Bureau of Engraving and Printing spokesman in Washington, D.C.,
said Faintich, at the least, has a nice conversation piece.
   ``It doesn't happen all the time,'' said spokesman Ira Polikoff.
``On occasion, they get out. I wouldn't say it's going to make him a
rich man, but it's unique.''
   Polikoff said the Treasury prints between five and six billion
notes a year with an error rate of about 0.3 percent. Bills are
printed in sheets of 32, but it is possible only one bill failed to
receive the proper markings, he said.
   Faintich's bill is in nearly mint condition. He said he had heard
of bills of this sort being sold in the past for $150 to $200.
   ``It's a neat error,'' Faintich said. ``Nice funny money.''

   If Santa had room on his lap for

   Adults still yearn for toys, just bigger. More expensive. Or more

   Glenda Highland of nearby Millstadt has one item high on her list

   But she's flexible.
   ``Or I'll take dark hair, dark eyes and an olive complexion,''
she told the Bellville News-Democrat last week in this southern
Illinois city.
   At the top of Laura Denning's list was one bigger-than-a-breadbox
item: a medium blue sports car with all the extras.
   Ron Edgar's list is short.
   ``A job,'' he said, laughing. ``A good-paying job.''
   Fran Huber of Collinsville is wishing for a worker _ but the job
likely won't fill the bill for Edgar.
   ``First, I'd like a baby sitter _ fulltime, live-in,'' said
Huber, two young daughters tugging at her as she took a break from
Christmas shopping in downtown Belleville.
   ``What the heck, add someone to do the cleaning, too,'' she said

   Willie B, the former couch potato gorilla, is
working himself into shape now that he has room to get out and do
some jogging.
   Zoo Atlanta's silverback gorilla, who has spent most of his 30
years in a cage, was released into a new outdoor habitat in April.
He had his first physical since that release last week.
   Willie weighs 440 pounds, down from 459 pounds, zoo veterinarian
Dr. Rita McManamon said.
   ``This is a good weight loss,'' she said. ``We feel it is due to
more psychological stimulation and physical activity in the outdoor
environment.''
   For most of his 30 years, Willie B, a member of a species being
wiped out in its native Africa by habitat destruction and poaching,
lived in a large cage built for chimpanzees in the zoo's primate
house.
   Bored stiff most of the time, Willie was given a television set

   Atlantis' astronauts zoomed toward
Earth ``happy and healthy'' today to end a secret four-day military
mission during which they reportedly deployed a radar satellite to
spy on the Soviet Union.
   The shuttle and its five travelers were on course to ignite
re-entry rockets for a fiery hourlong dash through the atmosphere.
Landing was scheduled for 6:36 p.m. EST on a dry lakebed at Edwards
Air Force Base in California's Mojave Desert.
   Because of the military nature of the mission, the public wasn't
allowed to watch the landing from the base. More than 400,000
spectators were there in October to cheer Discovery's return from
the first post-Challenger shuttle flight.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Air
Force Monday broke three days of silence on the Atlantis mission to
give a 24-hour notice of the planned landing.
   ``The crew is doing well and is making preparations for
landing,'' the agencies said in a brief statement. They also said
the weather outlook at Edwards was good and that a slow leak
detected before launch in a landing gear tire was not a concern for
touchdown.
   ``Things are going super,'' Rear Adm. Richard Truly, a former
astronaut in charge of the space shuttle program, said in an
interview. ``The crew is happy and healthy. The orbiter has done
real well. It's been very clean.
   ``This was one of our most important missions,'' Truly said.
``It's Atlantis' first flight after the standdown, and now you have
two vehicles proven in flight. That's extremely important.''
   The Atlantis mission was the second shuttle flight since
Challenger exploded in January 1986, halting launches for 32 months.
   Truly, who was in the Johnson Space Center in Houston Monday,
could not comment on specific accomplishments of the military
mission.
   The flight, under Air Force command, has been veiled in secrecy
since Atlantis blasted off Friday morning from Cape Canaveral. The
usual air-to-ground conversations of astronauts were blacked out,
and officials gave no briefings during the flight.
   However, sources reported Monday that the five military officers
had successfully deployed a $500 million Lacrosse satellite during
the weekend.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
satellite was operating well in an orbit that carries it over 80
percent of the Soviet Union. Deployment of the surveillance
satellite was believed to be the military mission's chief goal.
   The satellite is said to be designed to gather extremely sharp
all-weather radar images of Eastern Bloc military targets and would
help American intelligence agencies monitor Soviet compliance with
arms control treaties.
   Eventually, it also reportedly would serve as the ``radar eye''
for the new B-2 stealth bomber. That would eliminate a bomber crew's
need to use the aircraft's own radar, which might disclose its
location.
   Several experiments aimed at defining man's role as an observer
in space also were believed to have been conducted during the
flight, including testing of a hand-held optical device that
resembles binoculars.
   The mission was commanded by Navy Cmdr. Robert L. Gibson, with
crew members Col. Richard M. Mullane, Lt. Col. Guy S. Gardner and
Lt. Col. Jerry L. Ross of the Air Force and Navy Cmdr. William M.
Shepherd.
   The mission was the 27th in the shuttle program and the third
dedicated solely to the military.

   At Mel and Sherm's car dealership, auto
enthusiasts can shift time into reverse.
   Their business is called Sentimental Journey, and for those
nostalgic for the muscle cars of the '60s and '70s, that's exactly
what it is.
   ``Everyone always smiles a lot,'' co-owner Sherman Freund said.
``People have enormous affection for these cars.''
   On the showroom floor is a 1966 Dodge Charger, a 1969 Mercury
Cyclone and a 1965 Pontiac GTO, affectionately known as a ``Goat.''
   ``The thing I like about these cars is that you know which one is
which,'' said John George of Warren. ``When you'd see a GTO going
down the road, you'd say, `There goes a Goat.'
   ``They are distinctive.''
   All the cars in Sentimental Journey's showroom were built before
1975, when fuel economy standards went into effect in the wake of
the 1973 Arab oil embargo. The cars range in price from $4,500 to
$9,400, but without warranties.
   Freund and partner Mel Sternfeld try to get records that are as
complete as possible on a car's ownership and service before they
put it on the floor. And they test drive each car a few times before
they bring it in for sale.
   Before the sale, the men spruce up the car's paint and
upholstery, and ensure that it's mechanically sound. Eventually,
they want to expand the business, which usually has about two dozen
cars in stock, into a full-service dealership.
   ``We expect people who just like the cars, who would be proud to
take it out for a Sunday spin or who would like to drive it in the
summer,'' Freund said.

   The dollar inched up against the Japanese yen
Tuesday, while share prices moderately rebounded on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 121.54 yen, up 0.01 yen from Monday's close
of 121.53 yen. Opening at 121.57 yen, the U.S. currency moved in a
tight range of 121.51-121.60 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 50.82-point
loser the previous day, regained 54.70 points or 0.18 percent to
close at 29,669.38. The index gained 140.05 points shortly after the
market opened but the gain gradually decreased.
   Dealers said news of Emperor Hirohito stabilizing brought out
active market participants who had taken to the sidelines Monday
after reports that the monarch had suffered massive hemorrhaging.
   ``There is no major economic factor that is responsible for the
gain this (Tuesday) morning, except for news that the emperor's
condition has stabilized,'' said one analyst with Nomura Securities,
Japan's largest brokerage.
   Other dealers said the surging Nikkei index reflected investor
feelings that the Tokyo market was less worried and even ready to
deal with possible higher U.S. interest rates.
   In foreign currency trading, dealers said activity was slow
mainly due to uncertainties over the outlook for U.S. interest rates
and Hirohito's condition.
   They said market players were inclined to remain on the sidelines
in the absence of major news affecting the market. But market

   A woman who baked her boyfriend's parrot
following an argument was sentenced to 30 days in the Los Angeles
County Jail and prohibited from owning a pet for three years.
   Superior Court Judge Bernard J. Kamins on Monday also was placed
Guadelupe Rodriguez to three years' probation, suspended 365 days of
the jail sentence and reduced the felony animal cruelty by torture
charge to a misdemeanor.
   Ms. Rodriguez, 26, had pleaded guilty to the felony in September.
   Ms. Rodriguez put the bird into a covered pot after her
boyfriend, 29-year-old Robert Carballo, stormed out following an
argument. She put the pot in the oven and set the temperature at 450
degrees.
   The bird was able to escape from the pot as the temperature rose,
and thrashed about in the oven until it died, according to
prosecutors.

<TEXT>
   Two concealed but active faults cut giant
swaths through the area and could cause a major earthquake in the
nation's second-largest city, says to a scientist, who recommends
that building codes be re-evaluated.
   The Elysian Park Fault, unknown until it caused the deadly Oct.
1, 1987, Whittier Narrows earthquake, is about 10 miles wide and 60
miles long.
   It runs from Santa Monica Bay east through Beverly Hills,
downtown Los Angeles and Monterey Park, then southeast to suburban
Whittier, Fullerton, Yorba Linda and Corona, said geophysicist Egill
Hauksson.
   While mapping the extent of that fault, University of Southern
California scientists also discovered the 40-by-10-mile
Torrance-Wilmington fault stretching from Santa Monica Bay southeast
through oil fields in Torrance and Los Angeles' Wilmington district,
the Palos Verdes Peninsula, Long Beach and offshore from Newport
Beach.
   Hauksson's study of the faults, known as thrust faults hidden by
giant folds in Earth's crust, was scheduled to be presented today at
the American Geophysical Union's fall meeting in San Francisco.
   ``There's growing evidence that there's a fairly extensive system
of those types of faults in the Los Angeles Basin,'' said Tom
Heaton, scientist in charge of the Pasadena office of the U.S.
Geological Survey, which financed Hauksson's study.
   Thrust faults have caused ``damaging and sometimes very large
earthquakes in other parts of the world,'' Heaton said.
   Hauksson said his study suggests the five segments of the Elysian
Park Fault break in separate earthquakes. So the largest jolts
possible likely would measure 6.6 on the Richter scale on a 15-mile
segment that runs under downtown Los Angeles and 6.8 on the segment
that runs from Yorba Linda northwest toward Whittier, he added.
   But Hauksson said researchers can't rule out the possibility the
entire fault could snap at once in a major 7.5-magnitude jolt that
would cause worse damage in Los Angeles than the long-feared
8-magnitude ``big one'' on the more distant San Andreas Fault.
   It took only a four-mile segment of the Elysian Park Fault to
trigger the magnitude 5.9 Whittier quake, which with its 5.3
aftershock, killed eight people, injured about 200 and caused $358
million in damage.
   The Torrance-Wilmington Fault could produce a quake with a
magnitude between 6.6 and 6.8 or so, Hauksson said.
   Seismologists still lack enough information to determine how
frequently moderate and large quakes occur on the Elysian Park and
Torrance-Wilmington faults, he added.
   He said the faults pose such a shaking hazard that building codes
should be re-evaluated.
   Downtown skyscrapers would suffer broken windows but survive a
6.6-magnitude quake, which ``would knock down a lot of old brick
buildings,'' Hauksson said.
   The faults are about 10 miles wide because thrust faults are like
giant subterranean ramps, in which ground on one side of the fault
moves upward at an angle over ground on the other side.
   For years, scientists mainly feared strike-slip faults such as
the San Andreas, where ground on one side jerks horizontally past
ground on the other side. Such a fault triggered Saturday's 5.0 jolt
that left 32 people with minor injuries.
   But Hauksson and Heaton said concealed thrust faults may pose a
greater danger than strike-slip faults.
   Hauksson mapped the Elysian Park Fault and discovered the
Torrance-Wilmington Fault by analyzing 200 quakes, mostly magnitude
2.5 to 4.0, that shook metropolitan Los Angeles from 1977 to 1988.
He found 40 percent of the quakes were centered on the two faults.
   A 1980 government study said the ``big one'' _ a magnitude 8
``great'' quake on the San Andreas some 60 miles from downtown Los
Angeles _ could kill up to 14,000 people, seriously injure 55,000
and cause $17 billion in damage.
   A 1981 federal study said a magnitude 7.5 quake on the Newport
Inglewood Fault _ the major strike-slip fault inside Los Angeles _
could kill up to 21,000 people, hospitalize 84,000 and leave 630,000
with less serious injuries.
   ``Before we knew about the thrust faults, we knew the Newport
Inglewood was there,'' Hauksson said. ``Now we've discovered two
fault structures, both of which are somewhat bigger than the
Newport-Inglewood. That tells you the earthquake potential has gone
up.''

<HEAD>Commons Approves Northern Ireland Anti-Violence Oath</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Asociated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House of Commons has approved a bill that would
make all candidates for local and national elective office in
Northern Ireland sign a declaration disavowing violence.
   The measure, which passed the House by a 274-41 vote Monday
night, is seen as aimed mainly at Sinn Fein, the legal political arm
of the outlawed Irish Republican Army.
   A proposed amendment by the opposition Labor Party claiming the
bill would increase sectarian conflict in local councils in Northern
Ireland and thereby assist the cause of supporters of violence was
earlier voted down 291-195.
   Sinn Fein members elected to local councils in Northern Ireland
have repeatedly voiced support for what the IRA calls its armed
struggle _ its guerrilla war to end British rule in the province.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA wants to unite predominantly
Protestant Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland under
socialist rule.
   Sinn Fein commands about one-third of the Catholic vote in
Northern Ireland and captured about one-tenth of seats in 17 of the
province's 26 local councils in May 1985.
   The legislation, first announced by Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's Conservative government last year, will render elected
candidates who take the obligatory oath but then voice support for
violence liable to court prosecution by fellow council members or
members of the public. If this succeeds, they can then be
disqualified from office for five years.
   Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King, the Cabinet member
responsible for the province, said during the Commons debate:
   ``We cannot tolerate a situation in which people will exploit to
the uttermost the freedoms and opportunities a democratic society
can provide, while at the same time reserving the right to kill,
maim and intimidate those who argue against them.''
   But Kevin McNamara, Labor's Northern Ireland spokesman, said Sinn
Fein was preparing cynically to sign the anti-violence oath.
   He added: ``Sinn Fein would be able to portray itself as the only
party that the government feels is a serious threat to its own rule
in Northern Ireland. This is a major moral and political boost to
that party.''
   Tony Benn, a leading Labor leftist and a former Cabinet member,
said there was a war going on in Northern Ireland, ``not crime in
the ordinary sense as it is presented.'' Benn said that like any
war, it would have to be brought to an end by negotiation.
   The bill now goes on to what is known as its third reading when a
Commons all-party committee examine it clause-by-clause.
   Because of the government's 100-seat majority over all other
parties combined in the 650-seat House, the bill is expected to pass
its remaining Commons stages without difficulty. It is expected to
become law in time for the next local council elections next May.

   They were offered personal tours of Trump Tower
and the city's seamy underside, but the Gorbachevs apparently prefer
the sights most tourists crave: the World Trade Center, the
Metropolitan Museum, Central Park.
   Although a Soviet official said Monday that Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, want to take ``as many
bites as possible from the Big Apple,'' they apparently have
declined the fruit proffered by Mayor Edward Koch and developer
Donald Trump.
   The mayor had said he wanted to show Gorbachev the city _ ``warts
and all, because our warts are beauty marks in the Soviet Union'' _
and take him to one of his favorite Chinese restaurants.
   ``Maybe I could bring the People's Republic (of China) and the
Soviet Union closer together,'' he mused.
   Trump's publicists had said Gorbachev was planning to visit Trump
Tower and meet the man who built it. Trump was to guide the Soviet
through the Fifth Avenue building's glittering lobby, which is
sheathed in vivid pink Italian marble and features a $1 million
waterfall.
   But when the Gorbachevs' itinerary was released Monday, Koch and
Trump were not on it, although they will meet Gorbachev at official
functions along with dozens of other people.
   Even as Andrei Grachev, a member of the Ideology Department of
the Communist Party Central Committee, was telling reporters that
the Gorbachevs' stops would not be divulged _ ``a Christmas
surprise,'' he said _ the New York Police Department was spilling
the borscht.
   Following Gorbachev's luncheon meeting Wednesday with President
Reagan and Vice President Bush, he and Mrs. Gorbachev will ascend to
the observation deck atop one of the World Trade Center towers.
   Their 45-car motorcade then passes the New York Stock Exchange,
through Wall Street and toward Times Square _ all in the heart of
rush hour, on avenues closed for the convenience of the visitors and
the torment of drivers.
   On Thursday, Gorbachev attends a Soviet trade show at the Jacob
Javits Convention Center, then heads across town for an afternoon
walk in Central Park and a look at the Metropolitan's European
paintings gallery.
   Police also said Mrs. Gorbachev might visit a department store,
but they claimed not to know which one. Speculation has centered on
Macy's and Bloomingdale's, although a Soviet official noted that
Christmas sales at the former might make a visit problematic.

<HEAD>Utility Lied to Get Rate Hikes for Shoreham Nuclear Plant, Jury
Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury ordered a utility company to pay
$22.8 million, saying it engaged in racketeering by lying to obtain
rate increases to help pay for its Shoreham nuclear power plant.
   Monday's verdict awards the money to Suffolk County and could
make the Long Island Lighting Co. liable for $1.8 billion if the
trial judge certifies the suit a class action on behalf of all of
the company's ratepayers.
   The utility issued a one-sentence statement through its attorney
Michael Lesch, saying the verdict was ``insupportable'' and that the
company would appeal.
   The seven-member U.S. District Court civil jury found that the
company and a former president, Wilfred O. Uhl, violated the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute by lying to
the state Public Service Commission on three occasions about the
completion schedule of Shoreham to obtain rate hikes.
   The verdict followed a two-month trial of the county's lawsuit
against the utility. The jury awarded $7.6 million in damages to the
county for what it overpaid on utility costs because of fraudulently
obtained rate increases in 1978 and 1984.
   That amount is tripled to $22.8 million under the racketeering
statue. The county had sought up to $72 million in damages.
   The jury rejected the county's charges that the utility deceived
the Public Service Commission in obtaining other rate increases in
1975, 1976, 1979 and 1981. It also found no violations by three
other former Long Island Lighting officials who were defendants.
   ``I think the jury spoke loud and clearly that Lilco had been
engaging in a pattern of fraud for a decade,'' said Kenneth
McCallion, the county's lead attorney. ``A verdict in this case has
to send a message to all parties that the fraud engaged in by Lilco
has to be a major factor for those who are considering the fate of
Shoreham.''
   Last week in Albany, the state Legislature let a deadline pass
for approving a plan that would keep Shoreham closed and give the
utility 5 percent annual rate hikes during the next decade.
   The utility has said that while the plan could be revived, it
would proceed toward licensing the plant.
   County Executive Patrick Halpin called the verdict ``a great
victory for the county and Suffolk's ratepayers.''
   According to testimony, the Shoreham plant, 55 miles east of
Manhattan, originally had been scheduled to be in operation in 1978
for less than $1 billion. Construction was completed in 1985, but
the plant was never opened because of public opposition.
   The county said the utility spent $8 billion in the construction
of Shoreham, but the company said the plant cost $5.3 billion.
   Originally, the county had wanted to make the suit a class action
on behalf of all Long Island Lighting customers, but Judge Jack B.
Weinstein limited the scope of the suit before the trial started.
   After the verdict, Weinstein said he would accept a motion asking
him to certify it as a class-action suit. If he granted the request,
the utility could be liable for up to $1.8 billion, he said.

   In trading lacking major market-affecting news, the
dollar rose marginally against the Japanese yen today, while share
prices moderately rebounded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 121.54 yen, up 0.01 yen from Monday's close
of 121.53 yen. The currency, which opened slightly higher at 121.57
yen, moved in a narrow range of 121.51-121.60 yen.
   The currency market was very slow in the absence of major
market-affecting news, said a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``The dollar-yen rate hardly moved in directionless trading
today,'' he said, adding that the concerns over higher U.S. interest
rates had kept market players from selling the dollar, which allowed
the currency to inch up.
   Meanwhile, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the dollar's
excessive fluctuation against the yen has been stabilized.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
recouped 54.70 points or 0.18 percent to finish trading at
29,669.38, a new closing high.
   Dealers attributed the Nikkei's 140.05-point rebound in early
trading to the overnight gain in the Dow Jones industrial average in
New York, but the gain in Tokyo gradually decreased afterwards.
   A dealer with a major securities firm said the index's uptrend
slackened as participants began to take profits after the gain in
the morning session.
   He said trading lacked incentives to keep the winning trend.

   Ambulances were called to the scene, but no other details were
immediately available.
   The base is located on Michigan's Upper Peninsula near Lake

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Marcoses Paid $2 Million For New Condo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos have paid about $2
million for a penthouse condominium in a posh Montreal neighborhood,
a newspaper reported today.
   The Montreal Gazette quoted the condominium's builder, Angelo
Trimarchi, and sales representative Veronica Banco as saying the
penthouse was purchased through an intermediary in Italy.
   Ms. Banco was quoted as saying the Marcoses didn't come to see
the penthouse themselves.
   They said the building is still under construction in city's
Westmount neighborhood and should be completed in June, the
newspaper reported.
   It quoted Trimarchi as saying the Marcoses bought the second most
expensive unit in the building.
   The couple is charged in the United States with stealing $103
million from the Philippines during Ferdinand Marcos' 20-year reign
as president of that archipelago nation and with defrauding U.S.
banks of $165 million.
   Marcos and his family fled to exile in Hawaii in February 1986
after President Corazon Aquino took power in a military-civilian
uprising. They currently live in a house in Makiki Heights
overlooking Honolulu that is worth at least $1 million.
   Mrs. Marcos was recently reported having financial difficulties.
Her lawyers said her assets are tied up in legal proceedings.
   Tobacco heiress Doris Duke, a friend of Mrs. Marcos, posted $5
million bond for her last month after she appeared in New York to
answer the U.S. charges.
   ``I don't know if they plan to live here,'' Trimarchi was quoted
as saying. ``I don't think (the penthouse was purchased) as an
investment; if it was, they could have bought quite a few units.''
   Trimarchi and Banco were quoted as saying the penthouse was
bought by a Rome-based company after three women representing Mrs.
Marcos visited the sales office last week.
   The building, when completed, will have six two-story penthouse
suites, each with its own elevator and protected by an elaborate
security system. The Marcos penthouse has four bedrooms, three dens,
and two Roman baths, the newspaper said.

   A small, ceramic Santa Claus that Redmond and his wife, Louise,

   Thieves struck Sunday night or early Monday, snatching bows,
candy canes and other trinkets decorating mailboxes and trees,

   In trying to break the Palestinian uprising,
Israel is imposing collective economic punishments ranging from
sealing up village shops to blocking farmers from tilling their
fields, a human rights group alleges.
   The Arab group says in a report released Monday that the
sanctions are also aimed at furthering the long-term Israeli goal of
``colonizing'' the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``The scope of the uprising ... gave the authorities an excuse to
use such sanctions on a much wider, indeed unprecedented scale,''
says the report by Law in the Service of Man, also known as Al Haq.
``Such punishments have almost always been of a collective nature.''
   Al Haq, founded by Palestinian lawyers, is affiliated with the
Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists.
   Its report came three days before the first anniversary of the
uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
More than 300 Palestinians and 11 Israelis have died in the violence.
   Al Haq charges that Israel's sanctions are aimed at maintaining
the occupied lands as Israel's second-largest export market after
the United States, and at making any opposition to occupation
policies ``prohibitively expensive.''
   A spokesman for the Israeli military government in the occupied
territories, who spoke on condition that his name not be used,
denied that Israel uses economic sanctions to punish Palestinians
collectively.
   ``We try very hard to diffentiate between the great number of
people trying to get away from violence and the minority causing
trouble,'' he said.
   He said Israel imposes sanctions only to prevent violence or to
force people to pay back taxes. He acknowledged, however, that
curfews imposed for security reasons have prevented farmers from
working their fields.
   Al Haq, in its report, says one of the most harmful sanctions is
a limit imposed on the amount of money Palestinians can bring into
the occupied territories and Israel. Authorities say the move is
intended to block money from getting to Palestine Liberation
Organization activists.
   But Al-Haq noted that the blanket limit on the money Palestinians
can bring in from Jordan to 200 dinars, or about $600, disrupts
businesses and institutions that keep their assets in dinars. The
Jordanian currency is legal tender in the West Bank.
   A limitation of about $1,200 each on money brought from elsewhere
has hurt families dependent on remittances from workers overseas,
the report says.
   It also notes that to stop Palestinian general strikes, a main
tactic of the uprising, the army has broken open closed stores. At
times it has welded shut doors of shops to prevent them from opening
when the strikes are over.
   Farmers have suffered the most from sanctions imposed by the
Israelis, the report says, adding: ``If a farmer is not permitted
access to his fields in order to irrigate the crop, spray it or
harvest it, the entire crop may be lost.''
   In the village of Qalqiliya, it says, many crops were lost when a
25-day curfew in March and April prevented farmers from getting to
their fields.
   In several cases, the report says, Israeli authorities prevented
the marketing of olive oil, a major money-maker for Palestinians, by
closing down olive presses and confiscating the keys. Israeli
authorites say such moves are aimed at forcing tax evaders to pay up.
   Al Haq noted that Israel's efforts to break a tax boycott, also a
tactic of the uprising, included disrupting peoples' lives by
refusing to issue necessary papers such as business licenses and
marriage and birth certificates unless all back taxes are paid.
   The group also accused Israeli authorities of seeking to undercut
Palestinian society by closing down labor union offices, charities
and other institutions. Israel has accused such groups of being
fronts for anti-Israeli activity.
   Among institutions closed are 24 West Bank union offices, a
federation of charities in Israeli-annexed Arab east Jerusalem and
the Organization for the Care of Ecology in Qalqaliya.
   ``The sweeping nature of the measures against popular
organizations ... seems to indicate an intent to undermine the
institutional infrastructure of the Palestinian population,'' the Al
Haq report says.

   A longtime negotiator for religious freedom in
the Soviet Union says Mikhail S. Gorbachev deserves appreciation for
progress in that area and should be greeted with respect during his
visit here.
   ``He has recognized that the issue of human rights is an integral
component of international relations, and he has introduced numerous
changes affecting these rights, including the rights of believers,''
said Rabbi Arthur Schneier.
   ``I believe he will do more,'' said Schneier, president of the
Appeal of Conscience Foundation, an interfaith effort to expand
religious freedom around the world.
   Schneier, orthodox rabbi at Manhattan's Park East Synagogue, has
served as a point man for 25 years in seeking greater religious
freedom in various countries.
   He returned Friday from four days of meetings in Moscow with
Soviet officials about religious rights. On the basis of those
talks, he predicted ``a new liberalized code affecting religious
communities'' will be presented to the Supreme Soviet parliament in
April.
   He added, ``Our country and our Jewish community should encourage
President Gorbachev to continue in this vein.''
   Gorbachev will be staying at the U.N. Soviet Mission, across the
street from the Schneier's synagogue where a plaque reads in Hebrew
and Jewish: ``Hear the cry of the oppressed _ The Jewish community
in the Soviet Union.''
   The plaque was erected at a demonstration led by Schneier in 1965.
   But now, 23 years later, Schneier said New York Jews should greet
Gorbachev respectfully ``in recognition of the increased opportunity
for Jews in the Soviet Union to emigrate and practice their religion
and their culture at home.''
   This was made possible, Schneier said, by Gorbachev's reform
policies of perestroika, or restructuring.
   Schneier's Appeal of Conscience Foundation is a religious
coalition founded in 1965 and includes Protestant, Roman Catholic
and Eastern Orthodox leaders.
   Gorbachev also received praise Monday at a meeting of American
and Soviet religious leaders. Delegates to the U.S.-U.S.S.R.
Emerging Leaders Summit in Philadelphia were optimistic Soviet
clergy may be allowed to run for legislative offices.
   ``The message is coming through loud and clear that Gorbachev's
initiatives are spilling over and touching upon religious life,''
said Rabbi Gary Zola of Cincinnati, dean of admissions at Hebrew
Union College. ``There is new interest in religious thought and
religious life and the government is not only permitting it but also
is fostering it.''
   The weeklong meeting is sponsored by the Columbus, Ind.-based
American Center for International Leadership and the Soviet Union's
Committee of Youth Organizations.
   On the issue of religious freedom in their own country, the
Soviet delegates said Gorbachev's policy of openness is letting
church leaders speak out without fear of reprisal for the first time
in more than 50 years.
   ``We will have a constructive role in the secular society,
especially in terms of culture and self-determination,'' said Andrei
Rybin, 32, a priest in Moscow's Russian Orthodox Church.
   ``Religion will be more open. The Communist Party remains
atheistic in principle, but it now recognizes the role of the church
and that it had been neglecting it.''

   They've been putting a Christmas tree in the
heart of Rockefeller Center for 56 years now, but the thrill remains
for tens of thousands who gather for the annual lighting ceremony.
   ``We came up just to see Christmas in New York _ and this IS
Christmas in New York,'' said Eileen Ross, 52, of Fort Lauderdale,
Fla..
   The 75-foot Norway spruce from Raritan Township, N.J., came back
to life, in a way, when the power was turned on Monday for its
20,000 colored lights and crowning star.
   The ``ooohs and aaahs'' were quickly drowned out by a piped-in
Hallelujah chorus from Handel's ``Messiah.''
   It was, officially, Christmastime in the city. And the city
sidewalks were indeed busy sidewalks _ an estimated 70,000 people
watched the spectacle from surrounding blocked-off streets and
skyscrapers in midtown Manhattan.
   ``Once in a lifetime you've gotta come down here and see it
live,'' said Thelma Calabrese of Huntington, N.Y., who admitted she
also wanted to see Tony Bennett, who hosted the prelighting show
with Maureen McGovern.
   The throng, some of whom had arrived at the plaza four hours
before the ceremony, huddled in a 40-degree chill but showed
generally good spirits.
   Bruce Pelletier, 35, of Old Bridge, N.J. said he and his wife,
Jeanette, were making memories for their sons, Justin, 3, and Brad,
8.
   ``We've seen it on TV, and figured it would be fun for the kids
to see it in real life,'' he said. ``The kids haven't made us regret
it yet.''

<HEAD>Judge Awards $16 Million To Minister's Critically Injured Wife</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former minister was ordered to pay $16 million to
relatives of his critically injured wife after another woman
testified about being his longtime lover.
   However, the plaintiff's lawyer deemed the judgment against
former Methodist minister Walker Railey a mostly symbolic victory
because Railey claims he's broke.
   Lucy Papillon, 46, testified at a civil hearing Monday that she
and Railey had discussed marriage during their two-year romance and
that he mentioned divorce.
   But Ms. Papillon, a Dallas psychologist, maintained the plan had
nothing to do with an attack on Peggy Railey.
   Mrs. Railey, 40, lies in a nursing home in what doctors describe
as a vegetative state from which she is not expected to recover. She
was attacked and nearly strangled in her garage April 21, 1987.
   Railey, who was not at Monday's hearing, has maintained he had
nothing to do with the attack and was at the Southern Methodist
University library when it occurred.
   In civil proceedings brought by Mrs. Railey's family, state
District Judge John Whittington ruled last April that Railey
``intentionally, knowingly, maliciously and brutally attempted to
strangle his wife'' and cover up his actions with a ``false alibi.''
   On Monday, Whittington heard testimony to determine the amount of
damages Railey would pay the family.
   ``We were very pleased with the judge's verdict,'' said Bill
Arnold, an attorney for Mrs. Railey's mother, Billie Jo Nicolai.
   He conceded that Railey's financial status likely would preclude
payment of the award, adding:
   ``I don't know how much money he has or how much money he will
have in the future ... but I'm going to do my very best to see that
whatever it is goes to Peggy Railey's medical expenses.''
   Railey, 41, the key figure in a case that was featured this year
on ABC-TV's ``20-20'' program, refused to respond to the lawsuit.
   Police and prosecutors said they have proof that Railey, former
senior pastor of the mainstream First United Methodist Church, lied
about his activities on the night of the attack but that no evidence
links him to the crime.
   Whittington ruled that Railey should pay roughly $8 million for
his wife's lost earnings, medical expenses, mental anguish and
physical suffering and disfigurement, and an equal amount as
punitive damages.
   A physician testified that Mrs. Railey will require an estimated
$4.3 million in medical treatment during the next 30 years. Mrs.
Railey's mother said her insurance policy expires in September 1989.
   ``We do not know what we'll do after that,'' she said.
   Railey reportedly is living in San Francisco and the status of
his affair with Ms. Papillon is unknown, despite rumors that the
romance has cooled.
   Ms. Papillon, daughter of a former Methodist bishop and once a
member of Railey's flock, confirmed reports leaked last year from a
grand jury appearance that she was tied romantically to Railey long
before and after the attack on Mrs. Railey.
   She said their affair began in June 1986 and that it accelerated
in the months before the assault.
   Ms. Papillon said she frequently accompanied Railey on his
travels. In the days immediately before the attack on Mrs. Railey,
Ms. Papillon said, she visited Railey at a Dallas area hotel three
or four times. But she denied that the intensified affair led up to
an attempt to dispose of Railey's wife.
   She indicated Railey's relationship with his wife was functional
at best and said that until their extramarital affair, ``He did not
know what he did not have.''
   Other witnesses portrayed Railey as cold and insensitive, while
describing his wife as vibrant, active, musically talented and a
wonderful mother of two young children.

   Temperatures plunged below freezing in northern New England and
in parts of the Southeast today and ocean winds spread rain through
the Pacific Northwest.
   Early morning readings were in the single digits and teens in
most of Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, in contrast to milder 30s
and 40s in most other northern states.
   Temperatures dipped into the 20s in a few Southeast spots, with
Asheville, N.C., reporting 25 degrees at 2 a.m. EST and Augusta,
Ga., reporting 27 degrees.
   Rain along the Pacific Northwest coast was expected to turn to
freezing rain and snow in some inland areas. A snow advisory was in
effect for northeast Washington and a freezing rain advisory was
posted for the rest of the state's eastern part.
   Scattered rain doused parts of southern Texas and the east coast
of Florida, and dense fog advisories were posted for northwest Utah
and the central San Joaquin Valley in California.
   Skies were clear over most other regions.
   Today's forecast called for rain over the northern Pacific Coast,
turning to freezing rain in eastern Washington. Snow was forecast
for northwest Montana and northern Maine.
   Highs were predicted to be in the 20s in northern Maine and in
the 30s and 40s across the northern portion of the country from the
Pacific Northwest to the northern Rockies and Plains, the Great
Lakes, the northern Appalachians and New England. Readings were
expected to climb into the 70s in Southern California, the desert
Southwest and the coasts of Texas and Florida, while 50s and 60s
were forecast for the rest of the nation.
   At 2 a.m. EST, temperatures ranged from zero at Houlton, Maine,
to 68 degrees at Ontario and Van Nuys, Calif.

   Security for Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's
visit will be extremely tight, with 6,600 police officers working
overtime, in part because of the city's history of anti-Soviet
incidents.
   ``Security will be probably as comprehensive and as important as
any visit we have had in years and years,'' Gillian Martin Sorensen,
the city's liaison to the United Nations, said Monday.
   Gorbachev was to arrive in the city today. On Wednesday, he is
scheduled to address the General Assembly and have lunch with
President Reagan and President-elect George Bush.
   Among Gorbachev's expected sightseeing stops on Thursday are the
Javits Convention Center, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Central
Park. He departs for Cuba on Friday.
   During his last visit to the United States, the Soviet leader
made an unexpected stop in downtown Washington to greet the
lunchtime crowd. Police Chief Robert Johnston Jr. indicated the New
York police are prepared for such an occurrence.
   ``We have contingency plans,'' he said.
   Another security concern was the possibility that while her
husband was politicking, Raisa Gorbachev could swoop into the
shopper-swollen aisles of Macy's or Bloomingdale's.
   The Police Department also must be prepared for anti-Soviet
incidents.
   On Sept. 2, 1986, a tear gas bomb forced the opening night
audience for the Moiseyev Dance Company to flee from the
Metropolitan Opera. There was a bomb scare when the Bolshoi Ballet
opened at Lincoln Center in July 1987. A car at the Soviet
residential complex in the Bronx was firebombed in 1984.
   Five protest groups have obtained permits to demonstrate outside
the United Nations during Gorbachev's appearance before the General
Assembly, including the Coalition for Soviet Jewry, the Students for
Soviet Jewry and organizations representing Afghans, Ukrainians and
Armenians.
   Johnston said 6,600 officers will be assigned to work overtime on
the visit at a cost of more than $1 million.
   ``We are going to document every cop's assignment and apply for
reimbursement to the State Department,'' he said.
   The police will coordinate with the Secret Service, the State
Department and the United Nation's 250-member police force.
   When asked to characterize the force that will be in place,
Anthony O'Connell, the United Nation's security chief, said ``the
standards of security that are normal at this headquarters for the
visits of heads of state.''
   When about 90 heads of government attended the United Nation's
40th anniversary, hundreds of city police, teams of police scuba
divers, helicopter patrols and mounted officers watched the events,
conscious of possible terrorist attacks.
   The Police Harbor Unit stationed patrol boats off the U.N.
complex on the East River around the clock. Teams of police divers
performed daily searches of the riverfront piers for bombs.
   The city's biggest and most costly security and crowd and traffic
control operation was the October 1979 visit of Pope John Paul II.
The two-day papal visit involved more than 13,000 city police
officers and cost more than $3 million.

<HEAD>INS Official Is Charged With Bribery In Farmworkers' Amnesty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. immigration official has been arrested for
approving hundreds of fraudulent identity cards for farmworkers
seeking amnesty in exchange for more than $250,000 in bribes,
authorities said.
   Joseph Gourgue, an adjudicator in the Hialeah legalization office
of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, accepted the money in
exchange for processing 500 to 600 doctored identity cards under the
Special Agricultural Workers amnesty program, according to an
affidavit filed Monday in U.S. District Court.
   ``Unfortunately, the SAW program as enacted by Congress is highly
vulnerable to fraud,'' said Perry Rivkind, INS district director.
``Most immigration officials and employees are hard-working, honest
people. However, some may be motivated by greed along with a lack of
integrity as in other professions.''
   Gourgue was arrested Friday on a charge of bribery of a public
official and was being held on $100,000 bond at the federal
Metropolitan Correctional Center.
   According to the affidavit by INS special agent William H.
Morris, Gourgue's duties included approving or rejecting temporary
work permits and residency cards under the program that offered
amnesty for agricultural workers who are illegal immigrants.
   The program, which expired Nov. 30, was part of the Immigration
Reform Control Act of 1986. It was designed to make it easier for
agricultural workers to become U.S. citizens.
   ``We had reason to suspect Gourgue of being involved in an
unlawful scheme to approve SAW petitions knowing them to be
fraudulently filed,'' the affidavit said.
   INS clerk Yacenda Ambrose, who worked with Gourgue, revealed
details of the scheme to INS agents on Sept. 27, the affidavit said.
Ms. Ambrose, who was not accused of wrongdoing, told them she was
paid $500 to $1,000 per week to assist Gourgue.
   ``She stated that he used her to create SAW identification cards
for aliens who had not been properly adjudicated as eligible,'' the
affidavit said.
   ``Gourgue claimed that he had so processed between 500 to 600
such applications for $500 cash payment apiece. He acknowledged that
he paid Yacenda Ambrose to assist him,'' it said. The transactions
took place between June 3 and Sept. 23.

<TEXT>
   The dollar was stable at higher levels in quiet
European trading this morning. Gold prices were little changed.
   Currency dealers said some market participants withdrew from
trading in frustration over the U.S. currency's limited movement.
The only economic news capable of stirring the market from its
pre-Christmas doldrums is the U.S. October trade report due for
release Dec. 14, they said.
   ``There's very little interest in the dollar,'' said a dealer
with a major West German bank in Frankfurt. ``The market lacks the
incentive to trade.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.01 yen to a closing 121.54. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 121.50 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday:
   _1.7260 West German marks, up from 1.7225
   _1.4455 Swiss francs, up from 1.4420
   _5.8965 French francs, up from 5.8800
   _1.9552 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9425
   _1,275.85 Italian lire, up from 1,273.50
   _1.1875 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1851
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8675, compared with $1.8690
Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $428.50 a troy ounce,
down from $428.75 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $429.00.
   In Zurich, the bid price was also $429.00, unchanged from late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 21 cents to close at a bid
$429.73.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.16 a troy ounce,
up from Monday's $6.14.

<HEAD>Daley Seeks Mayor's Office Father Occupied for 21 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard M. Daley steps into this city's mayoral
race as the apparent front-runner, but gaining the office his father
held for 21 years may be difficult.
   Daley, Cook County's top prosecutor, formally announced Monday he
would seek the office that Richard J. Daley held from 1955 until his
death in office in 1976. But opponents said the Daley dominance is a
thing of the past.
   ``The mayor's office is not an heirloom to be passed on from one
generation to the next,'' acting Mayor Eugene Sawyer said.
   However, an October Gallup poll showed the 46-year-old Daley, who
last month overwhelmingly won a third term as state's attorney, with
a commanding 15-point lead over Alderman Tim Evans, his closest
pursuer in a crowded field.
   Sawyer, who's expected to announce his candidacy within a week,
was 12 points behind Evans and had support of just 10 percent of
those polled.
   Daley rejected criticism that his successful bid would mean a
return to the machine-style politics practiced by his father, who
used patronage jobs to maintain a political army and keep control of
the mayor's office. The elder Daley exerted such influence in local
and national Democratic circles that he was called ``Boss'' and
``kingmaker.''
   ``First of all, my father died in 1976. They (critics) should get
on with it,'' Daley said at a news conference.
   ``I'm proud of my name,'' Daley said ``My father was a great
mayor and a great father. But all the candidates have to run on
their record, and I've got a record _ both as a state's attorney and
a state senator.
   Daley is the seventh candidate to enter the Democratic primary
and the fourth white in a city that made Harold Washington its first
black mayor in 1983 and has split its vote along racial lines since.
   While the Daley name lent immediate credibility to his bid, the
lessons he learned in a 1983 mayoral try may prove more significant.
   In that year's Democratic primary, Daley split the white vote
with then-Mayor Jane Byrne, coming in third and catapulting
Washington into the mayor's chair.
   But in an almost complete reversal of events, Washington's death
last November has fractured the black voting bloc that was so
unified behind the former congressman. And neither Evans nor Sawyer,
who are black, appear willing to step aside.
   Daley, however, rejected notions that he could win simply by
appealing to whites, who make up about half the city's population.
   ``I'm not interested in running as the white candidate, or
serving as mayor for half the people,'' said Daley.
   ``Fighting crime is not a white issue or a black issue. Schools
is not a white or black issue. Protecting taxpayers is not a white
or black issue.''
   The Democratic primary is scheduled for Feb. 28. The special
election, set last month by the Illinois Supreme Court to complete
Washington's second term, follows on April 4.
   Evans had ``no immediate reaction,'' said his press secretary,
Sharon Jenkins-Brown. But another Democratic challenger, Alderman
Danny Davis, predicted a voter backlash because of Daley's
willingness to leave his State's Attorney post so soon after his
re-election.
   The other Democratic candidates are Aldermen Edward Burke and
Lawrence Bloom, former Chicago Park District Superintendent Edmund
Kelly and former state Sen. James Taylor.
   City GOP leaders were still looking for a candidate, though at
least one Republican, Edward Howlett, has announce plans to run for
the party's nomination.

<HEAD>Rebel Talks With Soviets To Resume In Pakistan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soviet officials and Afghan guerrilla
leaders said in statements released today that they will meet in
Pakistan for more face-to-face talks following two days of
unprecedented meetings in Saudi Arabia.
   The Saudi Press Agency released statements from both delegation
leaders _ Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov and Afghan
guerrilla leader Burhanuddin Rabbani _ saying the talks would resume
shortly in Pakistan.
   No date was given.
   Pakistan is one of the main supporters of the guerrillas. Seven
guerrilla groups form a loose alliance headed by Rabbani that is
based in Peshawar, Pakistan, a city near the Afghan border.
   The news agency said the Soviets renewed a pledge to adhere to a
U.N. accord and withdraw their troops from Afghanistan by Feb. 15,
and possibly earlier. It said Vorontsov made the promise during a
meeting with King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.
   The delegates issued their statements late Monday. Their talks
were held Saturday and Sunday in the mountain resort of Taif.
   The statements indicated that the talks focused on the issue of
an interim government in Afghanistan and that both sides needed time
for consultations before talks resume. Rabbani also stressed a
demand for war reparations.
   Moslem guerrillas have been at war with Afghanistan's
Soviet-backed government for nine years. Soviet troops intervened in
December 1979 and began withdrawing in May after the signing of the
Geneva accord.
   The guerrillas did not sign the accord, and the Soviets have
suspended their troop withdrawal because of guerrilla attacks.
   Reporting on the meeting with King Fahd, the press agency said
Vorontsov ``affirmed...what was previously declared by the the
Soviet president...of the determination of the Soviet Union to pull
out its forces from Afghanistan at the defined time, and perhaps
before that.''
   Rabbani said he and his delegation entered the talks on the basis
of the principles that Afghanistan ``was and would remain an
independent free Islamic state'' and that the Soviet withdrawal was
mandatory, the news agency said.
   Vorontsov said he came to Taif to fulfill Moscow's ``will to give
new momentum'' to the settlement, adding ``we believe the meetings
were useful and will contribute to ending the war ... and the
formation of an Afghani government on a wide basis.''

<HEAD>Opposition Parties Demand Full Accounting of Nuclear Reactor
Accident</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The political opposition today demanded
a full investigation into an incident at a nuclear power plant that
accidently released radioactive steam into the atmosphere a year ago.
   ``It is time for a full accounting to be made in Parliament,''
said Harald Schaefer, a leader in the opposition Social Democratic
Party.
   He called on federal Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer to
address Parliament's environmental committee, which is to examine
the incident at a hearing on Wednesday.
   Schaefer also demanded stricter regulatory guidelines dealing
with reactor safety.
   The calls from the Social Democrats and the environmentalist
Greens Party followed disclosure Monday that personnel at the Biblis
nuclear power plant near Frankfurt had overlooked a malfunction in
the reactor's cooling system for 15 hours in December 1987.
   Officials on Monday confirmed that Biblis workers scrambled to
correct a malfunctioning valve for a reactor cooling system hours
after the problem was first detected. But they denied there could
have been a dangerous loss of coolant or that there was a cover-up.
   Acknowledgment of the accident came after the U.S. magazine
Nucleonics Week issued a report on the malfunction.
   Manfred Popp, state secretary in the Hesse state Ministry for
Environment and Nuclear Safety, said Monday that on December 16,
1987, a valve in one of four cooling systems at the 1,200-megawatt
facility remained open after the reactor was restarted.
   A ``technical defect'' had kept the valve open, Popp said.
   He said a light went on indicating the valve was open, but that
workers ``apparently didn't take it seriously.'' Popp said the
reactor was operating normally and there was no other sign the valve
was open. A second valve in the cooling system was operating
properly, he said.
   According to Popp, the third shift noticed the valve had not
closed and in response began shutting down the reactor.
   Popp said a ``few liters'' of radioactive steam were released
into the air when the second valve was opened slightly to take
pressure off the malfunctioning one.
   But he said the release was far below the level of radioactive
emissions permitted by law and the reactor was safely shut down
again.
   The West German Federation for Environment and Protection of
Nature said ``the incident in Biblis ... could have come within a
hair of a serious nuclear accident ...''
   But Popp insisted: ``There was never any danger of a nuclear
meltdown.'' Environment Minister Toepfer said the incident was
reported to authorities in accordance with government regulations.
   He said the incident was rated for ``urgent'' attention by
regulatory authorities at the time.
   Toepfer said about 12 such ``urgent'' incidents are listed each
year for investigation.
   He said new control measures to avoid similar incidents have been
implemented and others are under consideration.
   The Biblis reactor, located in the Rhine River valley about 30
miles south of Frankfurt, first went on line in 1974.

   The commander of U.S. Air Force troops in
the Mediterranean died when the F-16 jet fighter he was flying
crashed during a training mission, the Air Force said today.
   Maj. Gen. W.S. Harpe was killed in the crash Monday near the
Torrejon air base outside Madrid, Air Force spokesman Sgt. Kenneth
Fidler told The Associated Press.
   Harpe, who was 51, commanded the 16th U.S. Air Force, which has
15,000 troops stationed at 10 American bases, including two in
Spain, three in Italy, two in Greece and three in Turkey.
   Fidler said the crash occurred near the town of Chiloeches about
20 miles northeast of Torrejon.
   Maj. Keith Gillet, spokesman for the 16th Air Force at its
headquarters at Torrejon, said Harpe was piloting an F-16 in
formation with three others near the end of a 90-minute training
flight when the plane crashed.
   Col. Juan Antonio Martinez Ortiz, a Spanish Defense Ministry
spokesman, said the jet crashed into a mountain.
   An investigation was under way to determine the cause of the
crash.
   ``I don't think we've had a loss like this happen before in the
Mediterranean,'' Gillet said. ``It's always a blow when we lose a
general officer. He traveled a lot, met a lot of people and was a
very popular commander throughout the 16th Air Force.
   ``It's a very personal loss for a lot of people here at
Torrejon,'' he said.
   Harpe became commander of the 16th Air Force in July 1987. Gillet
said the 16th Air Force's vice commander, Col. Leonard C. Ekman, 46,
had stepped in as acting commander.
   According to an official U.S. Air Force biography, Maj. Gen.
Winfield Scott Harpe was born Jan. 12, 1937, in Thomaston, Ga.
   He began his flying career at Beale Air Force Base in California.
In 1966 and 1967 he was assigned to the U.S. Air Force 388th
Tactical Fighter Wing at Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base in Thailand
and flew 100 combat missions over North Vietnam.
   He was promoted to the rank of major general in July 1984.
   In October 1986, Harpe was named the assistant deputy chief of
staff for personnel for the U.S. Air Force in Washington.
   Fidler said Harpe was survived by his wife, Ramelle, of Orlando,
Fla., a son, Randall, and a daughter, Andrea.
   Fidler said a memorial service would be held Thursday for Harpe
at Torrejon air base, but he said he did not know when Harpe's body
would be transferred to the United States for burial.
   The jet flown by Harpe formed part of the 401st Tactical Fighter
Wing, the only flying wing of the 16th Air Force in the
Mediterranean. Under an agreement signed between Spain and the
United States last week, the 401st wing will be transferred by 1992
to an air base in Italy.

   An anonymous phone call led police to a California
scientist who fled 18 months ago while awaiting trial on fraud
charges stemming from his job at a nuclear weapons research
facility, officials said.
   Police Lt. John Summers of suburban Chandler said Ronald K.
Stump, 49, was arrested without incident Monday in his motor home.
He was sought by the FBI on a warrant charging him with unlawful
flight to avoid prosecution.
   Summers said Stump apparently had been living in the motor home,
which was parked behind a service station.
   Stump worked at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in
Livermore, Calif., for more than 25 years when he disappeared in
April 1987. The Department of Energy facility, 40 miles east of San
Francisco, designs U.S. nuclear weapons.
   But FBI Agent Chuck Latting in San Franciso said said the FBI's
interest in the scientist stemmed less from his top-security rating
and nuclear research than his flight from trial.
   ``He was just able to get some bucks, and he flew the coop,''
Latting said. ``People around here got real exercised, wondering how
come we didn't put every agent in the world out to find him, and we
knew that if we went through a normal fugitive investigation that we
would get him, and that's what we did.''
   Stump was charged with fraud for his alleged role in the
laboratory's 1983 purchase of a $250,000 machine that didn't work.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Rodolfo Orjales in California said
earlier this year that Stump may have worked out a kickback deal
with a partner of the company that sold the equipment to the
laboratory.
   Stump, who filed for bankruptcy in 1980, owed $10,000 to the
partner.
   Officials said Stump had access to the laboratory's top-secret
Tritium Facility and other national clearances, but Latting said
Stump never was considered a national security risk even though he
left the country. Tritium is a radioactive form of hydrogen used in
some forms of nuclear bombs.
   ``Apparently he was not handling any military classified material
or doing any classified-type work, although he was technically very
qualified,'' Latting said.
   Allegations that federal authorities failed to investigate
Stump's disappearance and other employee violations at Livermore and
other laboratories have prompted an investigation by a House
subcommittee.
   Livermore administrators were worried about protecting the lab's
public image and chose to let Stump go free rather than risk
unfavorable publicity, according to investigators on the lab's
security force and in Congress.

<HEAD>Afghan Conflict May Be Hot Topic at US-Soviet Lunch</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   When Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has
lunch in New York on Wednesday with the outgoing and incoming
American presidents, Afghanistan is likely to be the most divisive
issue they discuss.
   A possible Soviet refusal to fulfill its commitment to withdraw
its troops from Afghanistan by a Feb. 15 deadline could present to
George Bush his first foreign policy challenge. He will be sworn in
just 26 days before that date.
   Any such move by the Soviets clearly would get Bush's relations
with the Kremlin off on the wrong foot.
   The luncheon will take place amid official predictions that both
President Reagan and Bush will encourage Gorbachev to meet the
deadline.
   ``I think they've made the decision to get out of Afghanistan,''
Vernon Walters, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said on
CBS-TV's ``This Morning'' program today. ``I think they're going to
stick with it.''
   Bush, however, has said he has no intention of trying to upstage
the boss. ``It will be President Reagan's meeting,'' Bush has said.
   Since the Geneva accords, which spell out terms of the Soviet
withdrawal, were signed last April, Moscow and Washington have been
accusing each other of violations.
   The Soviets maintain that U.S. and Pakistani support for the
Afghan rebels has been excessive, while the Reagan administration
insists the Soviets are guilty of a similar infraction with their
backing for the communist regime in Kabul.
   Adding to the drama about whether the Soviets will comply was an
announcement by Moscow in early November that it was suspending the
removal of troops.
   This did not constitute a violation since the agreement sets only
two deadlines. Moscow complied with a promise to have half of its
more than 100,000 troops back home by Aug. 15. The next deadline is
Feb. 15, but the pace of the second phase of the withdrawal is up to
the Soviets.
   Thus far, the conventional wisdom is that the Soviets will meet
the deadline while doing everything it can in the interim to bolster
the Kabul regime's military and political position.
   Most analysts believe that Gorbachev long ago made a political
decision to withdraw from Afghanistan. To reverse that course now
would expose Gorbachev to international indignation and would mean
continued Soviet military involvement in a war which Soviets
apparently have concluded was both costly and unwinnable.
   Still, the Soviets seem genuinely anguished by the level of
American and Pakistani backing for the Mujahedeen rebels.
   In September, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said,
``As soon as the Soviet troops began to withdraw, a non-stop
production line of violations was set in motion.''
   Other Soviet Foreign Ministry officials have raised the
possibility the Feb. 15 deadline might be ignored. To guard against
that outcome, the State Department has been urging the rebels to
exercise restraint toward Soviet troops.
   The Reagan administration has promised continued support to the
Mujahedeen rebels so long as Moscow continues its backing for the
Afghan government.
   Bush has indicated he plans to continue the Reagan policy, a
point he made two days after his election when he met with the
leader of the Afghan rebel alliance, Burhanuddin Rabbani.

   Scientists offered a warning as they
celebrated the 10th anniversary of the launch of the Pioneer 12
space probe, which has helped demystify the cloud-shrouded planet
Venus.
   ``Venus is not a living, breathing example, but a very dead
example of what a polluted atmosphere is like,'' said Donald Hunten,
a professor of planetary sciences at the University of Arizona.
   Venus has a history that suggests devastation by an extreme
greenhouse effect and extensive, naturally occurring stratospheric
pollution _ damage that researchers said may have particular meaning
for the Earth's inhabitants.
   But the words of warning Monday were mixed with messages of
congratulation. The success of the mission, originally expected to
last for 243 days, has delighted researchers who now predict that
the spacecraft will continue providing information for four more
years before its fuel supply runs out.
   The spacecraft has already generated 10 trillion pieces of data.
   Researchers are seeking clues to the mysterious planet, which is
similar in size, mass and density to the Earth. Scientists wonder if
there are clues to the Earth's future buried in the 5 billion-year
history of Venus.
   Venus, however, is much closer to the sun than is Earth, 67.2
million miles compared with 93 million miles.
   So far, the probe has helped map 93 percent of Venus' searing-hot
surface and helped to reveal continents, high mountains and deep
canyons like the Earth's ocean trenches.
   Pioneer 12 has provided a new understanding of volcanic activity
and land formation on Earth and has also revealed a severe
greenhouse effect on Venus that researchers believe may be the cause
of a surface temperature of 900 degrees Fahrenheit.
   ``We used to think when I was in school that Venus and Earth were
twin planets,'' said Hunten. ``More recently, we've discovered they
are really not very alike at all.''
   It appears to have been 4 billion years since Venus, which has no
oceans today, may have had enough water vapor to form one, he said.
   Information now suggests that high temperatures from the planet's
greenhouse effect, in which clouds or airborne pollution trap the
sun's heat near the planet's surface, may partially account for the
differences between Venus and Earth, researchers said.
   Additionally, extreme stratospheric pollution on Venus, where
chlorine is found at levels 100 to 1,000 times the concentration
found above Earth, could further explain conditions on Venus and
provide an warning for our own future.
   ``What I think it means to Earth is that we have to take these
threats to heart,'' said Hunten. ``We should not ignore these
warnings. These two examples of stratospheric pollution and the
greenhouse effect are real. It is happening on the Earth.''
   Scientists who gathered at NASA's Ames Research Center to
celebrate the mission's anniversary also urged a return to unmanned
probes in addition to the far more costly manned missions now
popular.
   Steven Dorfman of Hughes Aircraft Co., a major government space
contractor, called for ``a return to a mix of small and large
programs,'' pointing out that the Pioneer project was relatively
cheap at less than $200 million in today's dollars.
   Dorfman said the U.S. sent 36 planetary launches aloft in the
1960s, but only 11 in the 1970s and just two are scheduled for this
decade.
   Next year, the Magellan mission will team up with Pioneer to
provide high resolution radar mapping of the geography of Venus. In
February 1990, Pioneer will team up with the Galileo orbiter as it
passes Venus on its way to Jupiter.
   Pioneer's unique variable orbit, which responds to the effect of
solar gravity on Venus, has allowed the spacecraft to come as close
as 150 kilometers _ 93 miles _ to Venus and as distant as 2,300
kilometers, or 1,426 miles.

   A federal judge, reversing a jury award of $1.6
million to a man who said he got AIDS from a hemophilia drug, said
the jurors may have relied more on their emotions than the facts in
the case.
   U.S. District Judge Orinda Evans on Monday reversed the October
ruling against Miles Laboratories, saying in her 14-page ruling that
AIDS victim Randy L. Jones did not present sufficient evidence of
negligence by the company.
   ``While the court understands fully and shares the jury's great
sympathy for the Jones' plight, it is the court's responsibility to
disallow a verdict which has no basis in law or fact,'' Evans said.
   An attorney for Jones said he would appeal to the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Jones, 35, of Douglasville, contended in a lawsuit that a drug he
took in 1983 made by a division of the Elkhart, Ind.-based Miles was
contaminated with the AIDS virus and caused him to develop the
disease.
   Miles manufactures Koate, a blood-based clotting product, which
Jones took to control a mild case of hemophilia after surgery at
Clayton General Hospital. Two years later, he was diagnosed as
infected with the AIDS virus, and in 1987 he was told by doctors
that he had developed the deadly disease itself.
   Jones contended the drug he took had been contaminated by the
plasma of an unemployed Texas man with AIDS. The man allegedly sold
plasma 40 times to a plasma center in Austin, Texas, which in turn
supplied Miles. The man died of AIDS less than six weeks after his
last plasma sale in September 1983, the suit said.
   Jones alleged that more than 60,000 vials of Koate were
contaminated with the AIDS virus because of the man and accused
Miles of negligence in acquiring and using the tainted plasma.
   Miles, which denied any negligence, argued that it had initiated
a high-risk donor screening program in February 1983, months before
Jones took the drug.
   Evans said there was a possibility that Jones could have gotten
the AIDS virus from other blood factor products he had taken.
   Duncan Barr, the San Francisco attorney who argued the case for
Miles, praised the judge's decision. ``The overwhelming tragedy of
this case obviously affected the jury's decision and (the) judge has
stepped forward to do the correct legal thing,'' he said.
   George H. Connell Jr., Jones' attorney, said he didn't understand
why Evans ruled as she did. ``To me, she's wrong. So you're asking
the wrong person,'' he said.Jones, he said, ``is a pretty strong
man. He thinks he's right and wants to pursue the appeal.''
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, cripples the body's
immune system, leaving a person prey to deadly cancers and other
infections.

<TEXT>
   Families of Afghan officials have
begun moving out of Kabul because guerrillas are choking the flow of
essential supplies to the capital, Western diplomatic sources said
today.
   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
families appeared to be moving to Mazar-i-Sharif, capital of Balkh
province about 40 miles from the Soviet border.
   Various sources have reported major building activity in the
northern city in recent months.
   One diplomatic source said he had reliable information that over
the past four weeks the Afghan state security agency, known as KHAD,
removed the bulk of its files from Kabul.
   ``The Russians are presumably trying to protect all those who
have collaborated with KHAD over the years,'' the source said.
   Moscow agreed in a U.N.-brokered accord in the spring to withdraw
all of its more than 100,000 troops from Afghanistan by Feb. 15.
   Half those forces left by Aug. 15, but the pullout has since
stalled because the Soviets accuse Pakistan and the United States of
violating the pact by continuing their support for the guerrillas.
   The guerrillas have made major gains, especially in eastern
Afghanistan, since Red Army troops began leaving the area. Most
recently they have cut key supply routes to the capital, especially
the road running west from the Pakistan border.
   Western diplomats said bread and meat are in short supply in
Kabul and that there are long lines at fuel stations for diesel and
kerosene.
   Several communist officials have been sent to eastern Nangarhar
province with large amounts of money to try to buy the support of
local Shinwari tribesman, diplomats said.
   ``If successful, the tribesmen would be used to assist in
reopening the road from (the provincial capital of) Jalalabad to the
Pakistani border,'' said one source.
   Most observers predict the Afghan government will fall shortly
after the Soviets have left the country.
   Guerrilla leaders based in Pakistan have shunned numerous appeals
from President Najib to negotiate peace and have rejected all
suggestions of sharing power with the communists.
   The rebels held their first high-level meetings with Soviet
officials last weekend in Saudi Arabia. Western diplomats said it
was a sign Moscow had abandoned hope of keeping its Afghan clients
in power.
   According to statements distributed through the Saudi Press
Agency, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov and guerrilla
leader Burhanuddin Rabbani agreed to meet again soon in Pakistan.
   The agency said Vorontsov reiterated Moscow's pledge to be out of
Afghanistan by Feb. 15.

   A guard at a fast-food outlet said he was
ordered to drag an unconscious, homeless patron onto the street,
where the man later died, but the owner of the restaurant denied the
act was company policy.
   Joseph Eaton died early Saturday on the sidewalk outside the
24-hour fast-food eatery, where he lay for several hours as scores
of people walked by but never offered help. The 38-year-old man came
from a prominent Boston family, but his last years were troubled by
alcohol abuse and the loss of his lover to AIDS.
   ``If somebody was unconscious, and we put him out on the sidewalk
in front of the restaurant and watched him die, then we should be
taken out and shot ourselves,'' said Tom Thompson, one of the owners
of the Carl's Jr. franchises in San Francisco.
   ``That's not (our) policy, to carry people out of the restaurant
_ they have to walk out or we call the police,'' Thompson added.
   But guard George Waters, who was homeless himself before Thompson
offered him a job 3{ years ago, said in an interview Sunday that he
had followed the orders of the restaurant's shift manager, who was
identified only as Dan.
   The shift manager was reported not to be at work Monday and could
not otherwise be reached for comment.
   Waters said it was his responsibility to eject ``street people,
drunk people,'' and that he had done so before at Carl's.
   Waters said he found Eaton slumped over a burger at a restaurant
table, and assumed he had passed out from alcohol.
   Waters said he tried unsuccessfully to wake Eaton, shaking him
``just as hard as you can shake a ... car.''
   Waters said Eaton was breathing when he dragged him out to the
sidewalk just after midnight Friday, and he figured Eaton would
``sober up and get up and move on because it gets kind of chilly
when that wine wears off.''
   Waters said he noticed several times in the next few hours that
Eaton hadn't moved, but believed he was sleeping.
   ``If I'd known he was sick or something like that, I would have
called the paramedics. I would never have put him out.''
   A spokesman for the San Francisco coroner's office said autopsy
results on the cause of death were inconclusive. The preliminary
coroner's report showed apparent fresh needle marks on Eaton's arms,
and records indicate he was arrested in 1982 by San Francisco police
on a drug possession charge.
   It was 5 a.m. when the Rev. Thomas Flowers came upon Eaton,
someone he saw several times a week at his soup kitchen. He said he
couldn't see any breathing.
   ``I put my hand on his back and it was very cold. I felt for a
pulse and there wasn't one,'' he said.
   ``Unfortunately, this kind of thing happens all the time,'' said
Flowers. ``We have a lot of people who die in doorways and other
places.
   ``If (Eaton) had been a middle-class person at a restaurant
anywhere else in town and passed out, they'd have called for an
ambulance, or the cops if he was drunk and passed out. They wouldn't
just throw him out onto the sidewalk and let him lay there and die.''
   Police spokesman Jerry Senkir said the case was not under
investigation by police.
   Eaton's grandfather was Charles Freedom Eaton Jr., chairman
emeritus of Eaton-Vance Group Mutual Fund and founder of Investor's
Bank and Trust Co. of Boston. Joseph Eaton attended prep schools in
Connecticut. Years later he developed a problem with alcohol, said
his brother, Henry, a Boston reporter.
   Joseph Eaton also was gay, and his lover died of AIDS a year ago,
after which Eaton began to drink again after having not touched
alcohol for five years, his brother said.
   He apparently had been living on the streets since Nov. 12, after
his roommate asked him to leave because of his drinking.

   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said today he
would ask his left-leaning Labor Party to reverse itself and permit
talks with the right-wing Likud bloc on forming another coalition
government.
   Peres made the announcement after meeting with President Chaim
Herzog, a veteran Labor lawmaker who has urged Labor and Likud to
form a joint government. The two parties have governed in an uneasy
coalition since 1984.
   ``I was very impressed by what the president had to say,'' Peres
said. ``I told him I will propose to convene the (party's) Central
Committee this week. I will recommend to the committee to meet the
request of the president.''
   The Labor Party's 110-member Executive Bureau last week voted
against negotiating with Likud. The 1,300-member Central Committee
has the authority to overrule the Executive Bureau.
   Uzi Baram, Labor's secretary general, said later today that the
committee would convene Thursday to vote on Peres' proposal.
   The issue of negotiating with Likud has deeply divided the Labor
Party and renewed the longstanding rivalry between Peres and the
party's No. 2 leader, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
   Rabin, who would likely remain defense minister in a coalition
government, has backed talks with Likud.
   Peres' position has been more ambiguous. He was actively involved
in trying to form a narrow Labor-led government, but when he failed,
he appeared to move toward talks with Likud.
   In Nov. 1 elections, Likud won 40 seats in the 120-member
Knesset, or parliament, and Labor won 39. The remaining seats were
won by 13 small factions, including four religious parties that
command 18 seats and provide the balance of power.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Likud favors a broad-based
coalition headed by his party. But he simultaneously has been
working on forming a narrow coalition, especially since the rebuff
from Labor.
   Two of the religious parties _ the Torah Flag and Agudat Israel _
today accused Likud of deceiving them in coalition talks.
   Rabbi Menahem Porusch of Agudat Israel and Rabbi Avraham Ravitz
of Torah Flag said Likud promised each party control over the
Education Ministry's ultra-Orthodox department. They made the
allegations during a debate on Israel radio.
   Peres criticized Shamir for allegedly making too many concessions
to his potential coalition partners, especially the religious
parties, which are pushing for far-reaching religious legislation.
   ``Mr. Shamir should first have talked to Labor before negotiating
with the small parties to whom he made so many promises,'' Peres
said, adding that a broad-based government must ``prevent
legislation that will divide the Jewish people.''
   He was referring to the so-called ``Who is a Jew'' legislation
demanded by the religious parties. Such legislation would give
Orthodox rabbis sole authority over conversions to Judaism.
   The proposal has angered American Jews, most of whom belong to
the Reform and Conservative branches of Judaism. Dozens of American
Jewish leaders have met with Shamir and Peres to lobby against ``Who
is a Jew'' legislation.
   The ultra-Orthodox have also demanded several Cabinet posts and
legislation enforcing observance of the Jewish Sabbath, which is
opposed by the majority of Israelis, who are secular.

   Anglican Archbishop Desmond
Tutu today praised an 18-year-old white man who has been sentenced
to six years in prison for refusing to serve in the armed forces.
   Charles Bester was convicted and sentenced Monday, becoming the
second conscientious objector to receive the maximum six-year
sentence since a recent toughening of penalties for draft resisters.
   Bester told the court his Christian beliefs did not allow him to
perform military service because he felt the armed forces were used
to uphold apartheid. Dozens of supporters, including many young
blacks, attended the court session, and several were threatened with
contempt charges after they sang an anti-apartheid anthem.
   Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize winner who is the first black to head
the Anglican church in Southern Africa, said of Bester in a
statement: ``We believe your cause to be right. Be strong and of
good courage.''
   ``We are certain that justice and righteousness will overcome
evil oppression and we shall all be free, black and white
together,'' Tutu said. ``Your decision brings that glorious day
closer.''
   Tutu's statement was read at a news conference attended by
Besters' parents, who expressed full support for their son.
   Earlier this year, David Bruce, 25, was sentenced to six years in
prison for refusing military service, and Dr. Ivan Toms, who
completed his initial 2-year military service in 1979, was sentenced
to 21 months in jail for refusing to report for a call-up camp.
   Military service is compulsory for white males in South Africa
and voluntary for other races. The government has banned the End
Conscription Campaign, a nationwide group opposed to mandatory
military service.
   Under apartheid, the black majority has no vote in national
affairs. The white minority controls the economy has separate
districts and health services.

   Stuart Karl, who made a fortune
marketing Jane Fonda workout videotapes, was placed on three years'
probation and fined $60,000 for soliciting illegal campaign
contributions for Gary Hart and others.
   ``To be honest, I'm not sure why I did these things,'' Karl said
Monday in federal court. ``You're attracted to the allure of being
involved (in politics) and people begin to make you feel important.
I just regret doing this.''
   U.S. District Judge Alicemarie Stotler said she imposed a higher
fine than the $20,000 recommended by probation officials to send a
message to others who might follow Karl's example.
   However, she said she didn't make the sentence tougher because of
Karl's cooperation with the government and because this was his
first offense.
   ``This is a defendant who hopefully has had his one and only
brush with the law, although it was a sensational one,'' she said.
   Karl, 36, once considered a star in the home video production
industry, pleaded guilty Aug. 2 to two counts of campaign law
violations.
   The government alleged Karl asked former employees to contribute
up to $1,000 each to various candidates _ the legal limit _ then
reimbursed them in cash. The bulk of the donations went to Hart's
1984 presidential campaign, according to an indictment filed June
10. Hart, then a U.S. senator from Colorado, unsuccessfully
challenged former Vice President Walter F. Mondale for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
   Karl pleaded guilty to one count of making a political
contribution in the name of another person and one count of
conspiracy. Charges involving other candidates were dismissed Monday
as part of Karl's plea agreement.
   Both Karl and his attorney, John Vardaman, claimed the
entrepreneur was a tool of others. Without naming the others,
Vardaman said Karl had been lured into wrongdoing by promises of
access to a presidential candidate and proximity to power.
   U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner has said members of Hart's political
campaign who encouraged the contributions were under investigation.
   The Orange County Register has reported those under investigation
include David Rosen, Hart's 1984 finance director, and Laguna Beach
developer David Stein.
   Vardaman told the judge that Karl never sought any benefit for
himself from his manipulation of political contributions.
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Nancy Wieben Stock said Karl's
business dealings benefited from his political connections.
   ``He had forged a very successful business with the Jane Fonda
videos that really stemmed from a political connection,'' she said.

<HEAD>Utility To End Nuclear Operations At Fort St. Vrain Power Plant</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public Service Co. of Colorado says it plans to end
nuclear operations by June 30, 1990, at its problem-ridden Fort St.
Vrain power plant, the nation's only helium-cooled nuclear reactor.
   A decision on whether to convert the plant to burn fossil fuel
will be made before the end of 1989, utility spokesman Mark Sieverts
said Monday.
   The utility earlier announced that if it could not find
third-party assistance to continue operating the plant as a nuclear
facility, it would cease nuclear operations in 1991 or 1992. The
plant is licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to operate
through 2008.
   Sieverts said decommissioning the plant could take up to 55 years.
   Fort St. Vrain employs a helium-cooled reactor found in France
but not elsewhere in the United States. The plant began providing
electricity in 1976.
   The 330-megawatt plant 35 miles northeast of Denver never was
allowed by the NRC to operate for any length of time at 100 percent
of capacity because of problems that caused numerous shutdowns.
   A spate of equipment problems in 1984 led to a 22-month shutdown.
In July 1986, NRC Commissioner James Asselstine told a congressional
subcommittee that Fort St. Vrain was one of the 10 worst-run nuclear
power plants in the nation.
   In 1986, the utility's executives ordered a $101 million
writedown of the facility, and in October 1987 a fire in its turbine
building caused millions of dollars worth of damage.
   The plant has been shut since July for scheduled repairs. It is
expected to resume electricity generation in January.
   The utility said earlier it had three options for Fort St.
Vrain's future: Shut it and remove everything of use; convert it to
a coal- or gas-fired plant; or find a third party to take over the
plant. Sieverts said the company is now left with the first two
options.

   Health Secretary Kenneth Clarke has urged shoppers
to ``carry on buying eggs'' but defended a subordinate who said most
of Britain's egg production is affected by salmonella.
   As members of the opposition Labor Party yelled ``sack her,''
Clarke appeared before the House of Commons on Monday to defend
Edwina Currie, the junior health minister.
   ``She was right to stress the concern we feel about eggs,'' said
Clarke, citing 46 outbreaks of salmonella food poisoning, affecting
1,000 people in England and Wales, traced to eggs in October.
   ``We accept there is a health hazard which we are all tackling,''
Clarke said. ``The chief medical officer tells me he had egg
sandwiches for lunch and every healthy individual need not be too
worried.''
   Conservative lawmaker Sir Hal Miller said eggs were on sale in
Birmingham city market northwest of London labeled ``Dutch eggs _
salmonella free.''
   Eggs were taken off the menu Monday for 1,000 patients at
Nottingham's Queens Medical Center. They will not be served until
local health officials decides otherwise, said assistant manager
Rosalind Channon.
   Despite the furor, an egg-swallowing contest was held as
scheduled in Gloucester. Winner John Thornton, 25, swallowed 36
hard-boiled eggs in 15 minutes.
   In Kuala Lumpur, supermarkets removed British egg-based products
from their shelves because of reports of Mrs. Currie's comments in a
television interview Saturday, a store official said today.
   Lee Fook Kiong, manager of Weld Supermarket, said Malaysian
importers were to meet with the British High Commission to discuss
the problem and would restock only after approval from the Malaysian
Health Ministry.
   Britain's Ministry of Agriculture announced producers have agreed
to a voluntary code that includes buying chickens only from licensed
hatcheries, inspecting flocks regularly, discarding cracked eggs and
keeping eggs refrigerated. Most egg-related salmonella infections
come from dirty or cracked eggs.
   Furious egg producers have threatened to sue Mrs. Currie,
according to British Egg Information Service chairman John Coles.
   ``We have got an industry with a retail value of something like
one-and-a-half million pounds ($2.8 billion) and if we lose 25 to 30
percent of that market the losses will be astronomical,'' he said.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. reported only slight dips in egg
sales.
   Sir Donald Acheson, Clarke's chief medical adviser, told the BBC
pregnant women, infants, the elderly and the sick should only eat
eggs that have been cooked solid, killing the bacteria.
   For healthy adults, however, ``I think it is an acceptable risk _
it's a very small one _ for us to continue to enjoy our boiled egg
with a runny inside,'' Acheson said.
   Britons eat 30 million eggs a day produced by 39 million laying
hens on 5,000 commercial farms.

<HEAD>Greece Breaks Extradition Deal With Italy, Deports Suspected
Terrorist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greece today reneged on an extradition deal
with Italy and deported a suspected Palestinian terrorist wanted for
alleged involvement in a 1982 grenade attack on a Rome synagogue.
   The attack killed a 2-year-old boy and injured 34 other people.
   Police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Abdel
Osama Zomar left Greece early today but declined to say where he
went.
   Justice Minister Vassilis Rotis said in a statement that the
27-year-old Palestinian was deported to ``a country of his choice''
after serving two prison sentences.
   In 1984, the Supreme Court agreed to an Italian extradition
request for Zomar, but it was not carried out.
   ``The acts for which extradition is being requested are included
in the struggle for the reacquisition of the independence of his
country,'' Rotis said, apparently referring to the Palestinian
struggle for a independent state.
   The Palestinian is suspected of helping to organize the September
1982 attack on Rome's main synagogue.
   Zomar was sentenced to 20 months on weapons smuggling charges
after his November 1982 arrest at the Greek-Turkish border driving a
car filled with explosives.
   Italian authorities filed an extradition request in 1983 for
Zomar, who is said to be a member of a Palestinian splinter group
headed by terrorist Abu Nidal.
   In March 1985, a few days before Zomar was to be extradited,
Greek authorities said he was suspected of masterminding a grenade
attack against the offices of the Royal Jordanian Airlines in Athens.
   But the authorities did not explain how the Palestinian could
have organized the attack from his jail cell and the charges were
eventually dropped in December 1986.
   But two months earlier, Zomar had been charged with concealing a
weapon in his cell, and was convicted and sentenced in March 1987 to
another 20 months in jail.
   Zomar was one of three suspected Palestinian terrorists jailed in
Greece who are thought to be connected with the Abu Nidal group.
   The others are Mohammed Rashid, 39, a Palestinian wanted by the
United States for the 1982 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner and Omar
Mabrouki, serving a 10-year jail term for trying to shoot the
Jordanian charge d'affaires in 1984.
   The decision to extradite Rashid, arrested in May, has been
delayed.
   On Nov. 15, the Supreme Court indefinitely postponed its
extradition decision because it said it lacked key documents in the
case.
   U.S. officials have said they view Rashid's extradition as a test
of Greece's determination to combat international terrorism.

   A debt-ridden economy, drug abuse and efforts to
stem the growing problem of homelessness and hunger were among
subjects tackled at the opening of the 65th National League of
Cities conference.
   A call for cooperation, from the White House to city halls, was
sounded Monday first by Gov. Michael Dukakis, who greeted the 5,000
delegates.
   ``The issues we raised in the campaign haven't disappeared
because the election is over,'' the former Democratic presidential
candidate said. ``We cannot retreat.
   ``We'll be out there with you on the ramparts, fighting the
battle,'' Dukakis said, receiving a standing ovation.
   America is choking on debt, from credit-card wielding families to
corporations paying off merger loans to the trade and federal
deficits, said three economists in a panel on the country's economic
future.
   ``(President-elect George) Bush is going to face a legacy of the
Reagan administration in the enormous amount of debt at all levels
of society,'' said professor Benjamin Friedman of Harvard University.
   Friedman predicted Bush will have a crisis of conscience about
keeping his campaign promise not to raise taxes.
   The debt also will leave a burden for future generations, who are
likely to see a lower standard of living, he said.
   University of Massachusets professor Barry Bluestone advised
cities to concentrate on improving education, worker training and
retraining.
   ``No single city can have an impact on global economic
questions,'' Bluestone said.
   Friedman agreed, cautioning cities not to lose sight of the
long-term by sacrificing the tax base that pays for education just
to lure companies with tax exemptions.
   A city that offers good education and training will attract and
keep a good work force, he said.
   Tampa, Fla., Mayor Sandra Freedman told a standing-room crowd of
more than 300 how she marshaled private help to demolish empty
buildings used for drug trading and other crimes.
   In May, while touring Tampa's roughest drug-dealing areas, the
mayor hit on the idea of asking private firms to help raze such
buildings. The response was better than expected, she said.
   A demolition firm and a trash hauler donated their services,
worth an estimated $250,000, to tear down more than 50 buildings and
take away the debris, she said.
   The three-day project also provided free training for
firefighters, who practiced controlled burning of the buildings.
   The aftermath of the building-razing has been gratifying, she
said: Residents of those neighborhoods sleep easier now, private
property owners are tearing down their own vacant buildings, and
citizens call police with more reports of buildings used as drug
haunts.
   ``We know this is not the only answer to the problem, but it puts
the problem out in the open,'' Ms. Freedman said.
   Spokane, Wash., Councilwoman Sheri Barnard, addressing a workshop
on hunger and homelessness, said her city found it useful to engage
volunteers to find ways to help the less fortunate.
   She urged her fellow city officials to solicit citizen
participation to deal with the overwhelming problem of homelessness.
   ``You can turn around the problems of your area,'' Ms. Barnard
said.

   The leader of a military uprising
was placed under arrest and his followers turned over one of two
bases they held for five days. Rebels said they would give up the
other base today, news reports said.
   Questions persisted about whether a secret deal was made with the
rebels, who demanded an end to prosecution of officers charged with
human rights abuses during eight years of military dictatorship that
ended in 1983.
   Defense Minister Horacio Juanarena was to brief the Senate on
Wednesday on how the government ended the uprising, which Argentines
considered a threat to their 5-year-old democracy.
   President Raul Alfonsin has said no concessions were made to the
rebels. In brief comments to reporters at Government House today,
Alfonsin stressed the need to end the revolt ``avoiding bloodshed
that could have involved hundreds of Argentines.''
   Rebel spokesmen denied they surrendered and said they negotiated
a cease-fire that allows them to return, unpunished, to their units.
The army said today that the rebels ``are at their units in
accordance with orders'' of the army chief, Lt. Gen. Jose Dante
Caridi.
   It did not elaborate.
   The leader of the estimated 500 rebels, army Col. Mohamed Ali
Seineldin, surrendered Sunday night to military authorities but
returned to the rebel arsenal later to supervise the dismantling of
defenses, including trenches and land mines, at the arsenal.
   On Monday night, he turned over the arsenal at Villa Martelli on
the outskirts of Buenos Aires.
   There had been conflicting reports concerning the timing of
Seineldin's surrender. Initial reports said he surrendered Sunday,
but unconfirmed reports later said he turned himself in on Monday.
Officials today said the actural surrender was Sunday.
   The revolt began Thursday, when an elite coast guard unit
mutinied and joined troops who rebelled Friday at the suburban Campo
de Mayo base. Most of those rebels moved to Villa Martelli base
Saturday.
   Seineldin organized the dismantling of the defenses, including
trenches and land mines, he and his comrades had set up at the
arsenal.
   The army, in its statement today, said Seineldin is under arrest
at a unidentified Buenos Aires garrison and will be questioned by a
military judge. No mention was made of a trial or punishment for him
or his supporters.
   More rebels were at a base at Mercedes, about 60 miles west of
the capital. The government news agency Telam said rebels intended
to turn over that base to the government today.
   The insurrection began before dawn Thursday and was the third
military uprising in 20 months and the rebels' demands, including
for a change in the military hierarchy and better pay, were also
behind the two previous revolts.
   It was clear this time that the rebels had wide support
throughout the army. Five bases openly supported the mutineers and
units at several others refused to help the government.
   On Sunday, three people were killed when civilians outside Villa
Martelli began throwing rocks and bottles at the rebels, who fired
back, police said. La Nacion newspaper said police believe many of
the estimated 600 demonstrators were from the Montonero urban
guerrilla group.
   The government had claimed victory early Monday, saying the
military rebellion was over. But the public was skeptical because
Seineldin and many of the renegades remained at the Villa Martelli
base.
   In contrast to the current situation, soldiers who participated
in an April 1987 uprising were arrested, held incommunicado and
taken to military prison. Soon afterward, however, three-fourths of
the army's top generals were removed and Alfonsin proposed
legislation limiting prosecution for human rights offenses only to
the highest-ranking officers.
   From 1976 to 1983, the country's military rulers conducted a
so-called ``dirty war'' against leftists in which an estimated 9,000
people disappeared.

Parliament today in heavy rain to protest the plummeting living
standards.
   A triple cordon of police officers guarded the doors of the
Parliament building as about 3,000 shoe workers, mostly female,
chanted: ``You are afraid of women, shame on you!'' and ``Thieves,
Thieves!''
   At the Labin coal pits, 148 miles southwest of Zagreb, about
1,000 miners stopped working Monday to demand payment of a bonus for
having fulfilled the annual production quota one month ahead of
schedule, Belgrade newspapers reported.
   Also Monday, several hundred workers at the Bor copper mines,
about 90 miles southwest of Belgrade, staged a brief work stoppage
for the same reason as the Labin miners, newspapers reported.
   More than 3,000 employees of a fertilizer factory in Sabac, about
50 miles west of Belgrade, staged a street protest Monday, accusing
municipal Communist Party leaders of inefficiency and dishonesty. As
a result of the protest, the entire municipal leadership was
replaced, press reports said.
   In Belgrade, a total of about 7,000 shoe workers went on strike
today.
   About 3,000 of them marched almost 3 miles in the rain to reach
the Parliament building, chanting anti-government slogans and
demanding salary raises.
   ``We want proper wages, don't torment us!'' the crowd chanted,
pressing against the police cordon. After several hours, the workers
were allowed to enter Parliament, where they spoke with party
officials.
   ``I can't feed myself and my children with $45 a month,''
Gvozdenka Pavlovic said. The average Yugoslav salary is about $100 a
month.
   The demonstrators dispersed peacefully after Serbian Communist
Party leader Slobodoan Milosevic promised he would visit their
factory.
   Yugoslavia is facing increasing social and labor unrest as a
result of the worst economic crisis in the country's postwar
history, including a 236 percent annual inflation rate and a $21
billion foreign debt.
   According to official figures, workers' buying power has declined
by 25 percent since the beginning of this year and living standards
have dropped to 1960s levels.
   In the past 10 months, there have been more than 1,000 strikes,
many of them involving street demonstrations, the government said.
   Official Belgrade trade unions today called on citizens to refuse
to pay electricity bills if the latest 31 percent price raise was
not canceled.
   News reports said about one-fourth of Belgrade's 2 million people
have been unable to pay their electricity, water and heating bills.
According to the reports, power companies have begun cutting off
supplies in an effort to force people to pay.
   State-run newspapers said railroad workers in the capital said
they would stage a strike Wednesday if their salaries were not
raised by 50 percent. The strike would paralyze all rail traffic
coming in and going out of the capital.

   At least five Palestinian youths were reported
shot and wounded in clashes with Israeli troops today as a general
strike shut down much of the occupied territories, Arab reports and
hospital officials said.
   The victims included a 12-year-old and a 13-year-old, both shot
in the head, the reports said. Hospital officials also said 24
Palestinians had been beaten or hit with rubber bullets in the West
Bank city of Nablus.
   A military spokeswoman said the army was checking the reports of
bullet wounds. She said she was unaware of injuries with rubber
bullets, which are steel pellets encased in rubber fired to disperse
rioters.
   Businesses were reported closed and public transportation halted
in much of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Many schools were closed,
and traffic was light as few Palestinianworkers went to their jobs
in Israel.
   A Jewish settler was injured when a stone was thrown at his car
as he drove past the Dheishe refugee camp near Bethlehem, Israel
radio reported. The man was taken to a hospital, it said.
   In the West Bank village of Shuweika near Nablus, a 13-year-old
Palestinian boy was shot in the head during a clash with troops,
Arab reports said. Officials at Jerusalem's Mukassed Hospital said
the youth was in critical condition.
   In Gaza, soldiers opened fire at dozens of youths who marched
through the Khan Yunis refugee camp carrying pictures of PLO
leaders, Arab reports said. A 12-year-old was hit in the head and a
16-year-old in the leg, officials at Nasser Hospital said.
   Two teen-agers also were wounded in a clash in the Deir Balah
refugee camp near Khan Yunis.
   Also in Nablus, dozens of Palestinians were reported treated for
injuries from beatings or the rubber bullets.
   Officials at the Ittihad and St. John's hospitals said many of
the injured were women and quoted some of them as saying soldiers
fired rubber bullets inside houses for no reason.
   In Gaza's Bureij refugee camp, a 15-year-old Palestinian was hit
with 12 rubber bullets during a clash with troops, officials at Ahli
Arab hospital said. The victim, Khaled Al-Amyah, told doctors a
soldier fired at him from close range.
   The army, meanwhile, confirmed a 15-year-old girl was killed by a
plastic bullet Monday after about 50 schoolgirls stoned an army
patrol. A spokeswoman said the commander fired the plastic bullets
to disperse the rioters.
   The victim was identified as Asma Abu Obadah, who died in Shifa
Hospital of a bullet wound in the head.
   She was the 319th Palestinian to be killed since the Palestinian
uprising began last Dec. 8. Eleven Israelis also died in the
violence.
   The Jerusalem Post today published details of the death that
sharply conflicted with the army's version. The paper quoted the
girl's 14-year-old sister, Sahar, as saying an Israeli soldier shot
and killed the girl at close range as she walked home from school.
   Sahar was quoted as saying that she heard screaming, looked back
and saw a bearded soldier with a red beret pointing a gun at her
sister. The girl tried to run but the soldier shot her in the head,
Sahar was quoted as saying.
   Today's strike was called by the PLO-backed United Leadership of
the Uprising to express sympathy with Palestinians held in the
Ketziot prison in the Negev Desert, who reportedly have been on a
hunger strike over conditions.
   About 2,500 Palestinians are believed held there, including 1,500
jailed under emergency regulations without charges or trial.

   A billionaire businessman has pledged $41 million
for cancer and arthritis research at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center.
   Harold C. Simmons' pledge Monday, which officials said represents
the largest single private commitment in the history of Texas higher
education or medical research, will be used in part to establish a
cancer research center.
   ``I've got arthritis and I don't want to get cancer,'' Simmons
said, chuckling as he explained why his money would be used for
research in those areas.
   ``We couldn't possibly, this Christmas season, have a nicer
gift,'' said Gov. Bill Clements, on hand for the pledge.
   Simmons, 57, made his fortune with an investment in a small
Dallas pharmacy and later created a 100-store chain that he sold in
1973 to Jack Eckerd Corp. He has more than 30 business interests
providing him with combined assets of more than $3 billion.
   Dr. Kern Wildenthal, school president, said $24 million of the
gift will be used to establish a comprehensive cancer research
center, including the endowment of four distinguished chairs; $5
million will go for a building to house the cancer center; and $12
million will be used to fund the Harold C. Simmons Arthritis
Research Center for 15 years.
   The pledge will be administered over a 20-year period by the
Harold Simmons Foundation and related organizations.
   Simmons has already given about $7 million to finance the
school's arthritis research center since 1983.
   ``The fact that I've had the experience with them on a smaller
scale and I felt such great regard for their abilities here, that
was a key factor in deciding to go forward.'' Simmons said.
   Simmons said school officials approached him about making the
gift two months ago.
   The medical school received two other large gifts earlier this
year. H. Ross Perot gave $20 million designated to train medical
scientists and augment programs in biomedical research, and the John
D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation donated 29 acres of land
for expansion of the school's 60-acre main campus.
   The 45-year-old institution consists of Southwestern Medical
School, Southwestern Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and
Southwestern Allied Health Sciences School. About 2,400 students are
enrolled.

   Editorial employees of the Chicago Sun-Times have
voted overwhelmingly to accept a three-year contract, ending a
six-month dispute with the management of the city's second largest
newspaper.
   The settlement, worked out last Friday moments after a strike was
set to begin, was approved in a 132-26 vote Monday, said Tom
Gibbons, chairman of the Sun-Times unit of the Chicago Newspaper
Guild.
   The pact includes a $500 payment on Jan. 1 and raises of 3
percent in each of the following two years. The pay scale for
reporters currently ranges from $625 to $895 a week, based on
experience.
   Gibbons said the next step would be to work on better relations
with management.
   ``This was a long and bitter fight and there's obviously hard
feelings on both sides as a result,'' he said.
   Sun-Times officials said they were pleased by the vote.
   ``Needless to say we're delighted that the guild members have
ratified the contract and we're glad that all of this hard
bargaining is over,'' said Michael Soll, a spokesman for the
newspaper.
   Newsroom employees have been working without a contract since
June 1.
   The Sun-Times has an estimated circulation of 605,000 daily and
614,000 on Sunday.

<HEAD>Witness: Misleading Statements Made After TWA Hostage Release</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NESHA STARCEVIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American flight attendant who
was aboard a commandeered TWA jetliner testified today that crew
members later gave misleading accounts of the hijacking.
   ``There were so many different reports that I thought I myself
was at a different hijacking,'' Helen Sheehan, 45, told the court at
the air piracy and murder trial of Mohammed Ali Hamadi.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, has admitted he helped hijack
the Athens-to-Rome jetliner in June 1985. Thirty-nine Americans were
held hostage for 17 days, and U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was
killed during the ordeal.
   Hamadi has denied killing Stethem, of Waldorf, Md.
   Mrs. Sheehan said she volunteered to testify at Hamadi's trial
because ``I was very concerned that misinformation ... should now be
coming out.''
   She did not give specific details of purported misinformation
during her initial testimony, but criticized a U.S. television movie
based on the hijacking, saying: ``Mr. Hamadi was clearly shown as
being the killer of Mr. Stethem. In my estimation, that was putting
someone on trial without giving them due process.''
   Mrs. Sheehan did not elaborate on the key events of the hijacking
or on Stethem's murder. She said she heard the shot that killed
Stethem, but did not witness the murder.
   Mrs. Sheehan said she disagreed strongly with some statements
made by her fellow crew members after their release. She also
criticized TWA management and FBI agents for the way they handled
events immediately after the hostages were released.
   ``We were returned to New York and we walked into a circus
atmosphere,'' she said.
   The accounts, as well as previous court testimony, accised Hamadi
of beating passengers and threatening to kill them.
   Mrs. Sheehan, however, said Hamadi sometimes acted with kindness
to the hostages.
   ``Mr. Hamadi personally gave a glass of water to a U.S. Navy
diver,'' Mrs. Sheehan said, referring to an earlier witness, Clinton
Suggs.
   ``Mr. Hamadi also served a meal to another American,'' who was
badly beaten by the hijackers, said Mrs. Sheehan, who added she
still works for TWA.
   Under court guidelines to protect witnesses, Sheehan was not
asked to give her current residence.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt Airport in January 1987 after
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.
   The West German government last year turned down a U.S. request
for Hamadi's extradition.
   Hamadi's older brother, Abbas Ali Hamadi, is serving a 13-year
prison sentence in West Germany after being convicted of helping to
kidnap two West Germans in Beirut in an effort to win release of his
brother.
   The West German hostages have since been released.

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci
visited a U.S. Navy combat barge in the northern gulf today,
carrying the message that American efforts helped end the Iraq-Iran
war.
   The Pentagon chief flew by helicopter to the barge Hercules,
anchored off Saudi Arabia.
   Carlucci later flew to Riyadh, the Saudi capital, for meetings
with senior defense officials before heading for Kuwait, the last
stop on his five-day gulf tour.
   He is almost certain to be the last top Reagan administration
official to visit the gulf. Carlucci is thanking leaders of Arab
states that supported U.S. efforts to protect shipping and maintain
open sea lanes despite the war.
   However, it was the refusal of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to allow
U.S. bases on their territory that prompted the Pentagon to lease
the Hercules and another big construction barge as offshore combat
and supply bases.
   Highly secret until a few months ago, the fortified barges
supported U.S. helicopter and gunboat patrols. U.S. officer credit
them with halting Iranian attacks on commercial shipping in the
northern gulf for about eight months.
   The second barge, Wimbrown 7, was taken out of service a month
ago. But U.S. sources say Hercules probably will remain on station
until Washington is convinced the fighting will not erupt again.
   In Bahrain, Carlucci delivered a personal message from President
Reagan to the Emir, Sheik Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa, and talked to
top defense officials.
   Monday night he was guest of honor at a banquet hosted by
Bahrain's Crown Prince, Sheik Hamad bin Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa.
   Earlier today, Carlucci presented awards on the flight deck of
the Navy's gulf flagship USS La Salle and stopped briefly aboard the
missile cruiser USS Josephus Daniels, the missile destroyer Waddell
and the minesweeper Fearless, all in port for the occasion.
   He told La Salle's crew that the Aug. 20 cease-fire ending the
eight-year war between Iraq and Iran vindicated a U.S. intervention
policy originally condemned by critics.
   ``Results speak for themselves,'' said Carlucci. ``Through your
actions, in large measure, you have helped bring an end to one of
the bloodiest wars in history.
   ``We have succeeded in convincing Iran that terrorism on the high
seas does not pay political dividends. We have demonstrated that we
can stand by our friends, and we have demonstrated that we know who
our friends are.''
   He said the largest U.S. naval operation since Vietnam also had
``demonstrated to the world our ability to project power, to show
determination and to defend vital principles including the principle
of freedom of navigation.''

<HEAD>Ambassador Urges Swiss Citizens To Leave Lebanon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Swiss Ambassador Dino Sciolli today urged
the estimated 200 Swiss nationals in Lebanon to leave the country
following the Nov. 17 abduction of a Swiss Red Cross worker.
   Four Swiss staffers of the International Committee of the Red
Cross left for Geneva today aboard a Middle East Airlines plane,
said a police spokesman.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named under standing regulations,
refused to identify the staffers.
   No group has claimed responsibility for the abduction of Peter
Winkler, the 32-year-old Swiss Red Cross delegate seized by three
gunmen in the southern port of Sidon.
   Since the abduction, eight Swiss Red Cross employess have left
Lebanon, and about 23 remain in the country.
   ``I've advised the Swiss citizens to leave Lebanon,'' Sciolli
told reporters. The Swiss government has banned its citizens from
visiting Lebanon for non-essential reasons.
   Winkler said in a handwritten note released by his kidnappers
Friday that he was abducted in order to be exchanged for a Lebanese
member of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, held in Geneva.
   Lebanese police theorize Winkler was seized to swap him for
Shiite Moslem hijacker Hussein Hariri, who is scheduled to go on
trial in Geneva on Feb. 20 for a 1987 hijacking that ended when he
was overpowered after killing a passenger.
   Hezbollah is the umbrella group for pro-Iranian underground
factions believed to be holding most of the 14 foreign hostages,
including nine Americans, three Britons, an Irishman, an Italian and
a Belgian.
   The hostage held longest is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March
16, 1985.

<HEAD>Court Rules Spy-Agency Employees Not Entitled to Hearings with
Fired</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal employees holding sensitive spy-agency
jobs are not entitled to administrative hearings when fired as
security risks, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously today.
   The justices reversed a lower court's ruling that would have
required such a hearing for a National Security Agency employee who
says he was fired because of his homosexual activities.
   The employee, identified in court documents by the fictitious
name ``John Doe'', works with secret codes at the spy agency.
   Doe told his superiors in 1982 that he had homosexual relations
with several foreigners during vacation travels abroad.
   After a psychiatric evaluation, the agency ordered him fired on
grounds his ``indiscriminate'' sexual activities posed a security
risk since he had access in the job he had held for 16 years to
highly classified information.
   The agency said his homosexuality was not the determining factor
in his firing.
   Doe sued the agency and the secretary of defense, who had upheld
the dismissal. The lawsuit claimed that the firing violated a civil
service law entitling each federal employee to an administrative
hearing before being fired.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled for Doe last year.
   But Justice Byron R. White, writing for the high court today,
said the appeals court was wrong.
   White said Congress never intended to require the National
Security Agency to conduct such hearings for employees considered
security risks.
   White said the spy agency is authorized by law to appoint people
to sensitive intelligence jobs ``without regard to the civil service
laws.''
   ``Although (the authorizing law) does not refer to termination,
the court has held, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that
absent a specific provision to the contrary the power of removal
from office is incident to the power of appointment,'' White said.
   The Supreme Court ruled in a similar case earlier this year that
the Merit Systems Protection Board, which provides job protection to
federal workers, lacks the authority to reinstate an employee fired
for lacking security clearance.
   The court in that ruling upheld the firing of an employee at a
Navy facility.
   The case is Carlucci vs. Doe, 87-751.

   has its Hollywood sign, but city
fathers figured that wasn't enough of a symbol for a metropolis that
has expanded beyond filmdom into a major economic and cultural
center.
   They wanted something impressive that would catch the eye of
visitors, something to rival the Statue of Liberty. And where better
to put it than between the eastbound and westbound lanes of the
Hollywood Freeway, towering over the city's motorists?
   On Monday, the West Coast Gateway Committee unveiled the winners
of their competition to design a suitable monument: two architects,
not from Los Angeles but from New York.
   ``This is the project that's going to lead Los Angeles, at least
in architecture and vision, to be a true world-class city,'' said
committee chairman Nick Patsaouras. The committee hopes corporate
donations will foot the $45 million cost.
   Architect Hani Rashid, who designed the monument along with
partner Lise Ann Couture, calls it ``clouds of steel.''
   The design calls for two giant aquariums with marine life fromark of
Peace and Unity'' and the ``Musical
Forest,'' as well as theaters, art galleries and an immigration
museum.
   Patsaouras said the design is ``a combination of structures that
are simple, geometric figures _ squares, cones, rectangles _
connected with a fantastic engineering excellence.''
   He said it will be made of steel, aluminum and bronze with
``cables like the Golden Gate Bridge.''
   ``We didn't want to pigeonhole Los Angeles in a conventional
sense. It is a very creative design that will stand the test of
time. That was one of our objectives, that 100 years from now our
descendants will say, `Our forefathers had vision,''' said
Patsaouras.
   Mayor Tom Bradley launched the design contest in February for a
monument to welcome newcomers to U.S. shores, as the Statue of
Liberty in New York Harbor has done for more than 100 years.
   The committee chose five finalists from the 150 designs
submitted. The finalists were from Massachusetts, the Soviet Union,
Austria and California, in addition to New York.
   The other finalists' designs were a giant video screen facing
freeway drivers; towering fountains of water; a design described by
its creator as a ``vessel for social gathering''; and a giant
transparent bird that lays an egg on the street.
   The mayor was attending a National League of Cities meeting in
Boston on Monday and had not been told of the selection, a spokesman
said.
   ``He knows that they were about ready to unveil the final
selection but hasn't seen it,'' said press secretary Fred MacFarlane.
   The international panel that selected the monument design
included Sverre Fehn, an architect from Norway, Juhani Pallasmaa, an
architect and director of the Museum of Helsinki in Finland, and
actor George Takei, who portrayed Sulu on the former ``Star Trek''
television series.
   ``The design says Los Angeles,'' said Takei. ``It's energy. It's
action. And it has to be over a freeway. Freeways are what we are.''

<HEAD>Police Ban Protests Against Treason Trial</HEAD>

   The police commissioner today
banned all protest meetings related to the treason and terrorism
trial of 11 black activists.
   Gen. Hendrik de Witt's order specifically prohibits a meeting
planned tonight at Johannesburg's University of the Witwatersrand.
Several anti-apartheid leaders were to speak, including the Rev.
Allan Boesak.
   Meeting organizers said they might instead hold a church service
for the convicted activists, who include three senior leaders of the
banned United Democratic Front, the country's largest anti-apartheid
group.
   The defendants were found guilty last month, four of treason and
seven of terrorism.
   Trial Judge Kees van Dijkhorst ruled the United Democratic Front
was a revolutionary organization that collaborated with the outlawed
African National Congress to incite anti-government violence in
1984. Boesak, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and other United
Democratic Front supporters were named as unindicted co-conspirators.
   The State Department criticized the treason verdicts delivered
last month, saying the defendants were convicted of activities
accepted in any legitimate democracy. South African Foreign Minister
Pik Botha angrily rejected it as unwarranted interference in a
domestic matter.
   Some of the best known opponents of apartheid have been called
since Monday to give evidence for the defendants at hearings to
determine their sentences. Half the orginal 22 defendants, first
brought to trial in 1985, were acquitted.
   Commissioner De Witt said protest meetings like that planned
tonight were used to ``mobilize the masses'' to oppose the
government. He cited van Dijkhorst's judgment that the core of
United Democratic Front leadership functioned as the internal wing
of the ANC.
   The three best known defendants in the trial, all convicted of
treason, are Popo Molefe, 36, who was the Unite Democratic Front's
national secretary; Terror Lekota, 40, its publicity secretary, and
Moses Chikane, 40, Transvaal province branch secretary.
   The maximum penalty is death, but van Dijkhorst is expected to
impose prison terms when the hearings end, possibly this week.
   Among those who testified Monday and today were South Africa's
foremost novelist, Nadine Gordimer, and Frederik van Zyl Slabbert,
former leader of the liberal Progressive Federal Party.
   They and other witnesses have said the government should lift its
ban on the ANC and acknowledge the broad support the group has among
the disenfranchised black majority.
   On Monday, visiting U.S. Sens. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and David Boren,
D-Okla., attended the hearing. The senators met with President P.W.
Botha in Cape Town today, according to Botha's office. No details
were made public.
   The senators, who have issued no statements about their
fact-finding visit, are believed to be seeking a meeting with ANC
leader Nelson Mandela. Mandela, jailed since 1962, is recuperating
from tuberculosis in a Cape Town clinic and is expected to
transferred soon to some type of private residence where he will
remain under guard. He is serving a life term.

   An impatient gunman helped store
clerks scoop more than $560,000 in jewels into his shopping bag, but
hung around long enough for store cameras to record him, police said.
   The robber waited until customers had left the jewelry section of
the fashionable Neiman-Marcus department store before making his
move Sunday afternoon, police spokesman Bob Oakley said Monday.
   He asked a clerk to see one piece of jewelry, then showed her an
automatic pistol ``and told her he wanted it all,'' Oakley said.
   When another clerk appeared from a storeroom, the thief ordered
the clerks to fill a green shopping bag with fine jewelry, police
said.
   ``When they weren't doing it fast enough for him, he reached over
the counter, grabbed a rack and emptied it himself,'' Oakley said.
   The store's videotape security cameras recorded the robbery and
the man as he waited for his chance to be alone at the jewelry
counter, police said.
   Police were to review the tapes.
   After the robbery, the man fled the store and melted into the
holiday shopping crowd at the Newport Center mall.
   Store officials estimated the value of the take at $562,400,
Oakley said. No shots were fired.
   It was the second jewelry heist in as many weeks in the same area
of Orange County, but authorities said there was no apparent link
between the holdup on Sunday and the Nov. 22 robbery by four gunmen
of a Slavick's jewelry store in the South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa,
adjacent to Newport Beach. An estimated $1 million was taken in that
robbery.

   A man wanted in the killings of his wife and
two convenience store clerks in Missouri and Illinois apparently
killed himself with his own gun while being pursued by police,
authorities say.
   Roger Moore, 37, a scrap metal worker from the Chicago suburb of
Berwyn, was found dead in his car late Monday after it struck a
light pole on Interstate 55 southwest of Joliet, said Will County
Sheriff John Johnsen. Joliet is about 40 miles southwest of Chicago.
   Police who were pursuing Moore's car heard a gunshot moments
before the crash and found a .357-caliber Magnum handgun lying in
the car's wreckage, Johnsen said.
   Johnsen said the cause of death appeared to be a single bullet
wound to the right temple, but an autopsy was planned.
   Moore was charged earlier Monday in a warrant with first-degree
murder in the shooting death of his wife, Sandra Moore, 36, said Lt.
Marilyn Dixon of the sheriff's department.
   Mrs. Moore was shot to death Sunday at her parents' home east of
Joliet during a domestic dispute, authorities said. The couple's
four children were in the house at the time, but none was harmed.
   Moore also was being sought for questioning in the killing of
Robert Bull Plume, 23, of Mahomet, Ill., who was shot during an
armed robbery.
   Plume's body was found early Monday behind the counter of the
convenience store where he worked in Mahomet, about 10 miles
northwest of Champaign in east-central Illinois, police said.
   Moore also was a suspect in the fatal shooting of Mary
Schweigert, 30, of rural Ste. Genevieve, Mo., about 60 miles south
of St. Louis, said Richard Lee, chief deputy of the Ste. Genevieve
County Sheriff's Department. Miss Schweigert was killed Monday in an
apparent robbery of a truck stop off Interstate 55, Lee said.
   A customer found her lying on the floor behind the counter of the
convenience store, authorities said. Money had been taken from the
cash register.

   Clashes between feuding ethnic groups in Azerbaijan
left three people dead and six wounded, including three soldiers
hurt while trying to halt riots, the Foreign Ministry and official
media said today.
   News accounts from the neighboring republic of Armenia reported
deaths there as well but gave no details.
   The renewed unrest came despite a Kremlin effort to restore
order. The effort included directives to party and government
leaders to stop the violence, establishment of a program of aid to
more than 180,000 refugees and threats to fire and prosecute
officials who allow workers to be fired for ethnic reasons.
   The deaths in Azerbaijan raised the toll in the last three weeks
of unrest to at least 31.
   ``Three people were killed, but not as a result of clashes with
law enforcement agencies,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim
Perfiliev told a news briefing.
   ``Six people were wounded, including three servicemen,''
Perfiliev added. He said the deaths took place in Azerbaijan, but
did not say when they occurred or provide other details.
   Earlier, official Baku radio said three soldiers and a medical
student were wounded Monday in clashes with gangs in the Azerbaijani
capital.
   ``Extremists and criminal elements provoked disorders on massive
scales and attempted to commit acts of looting and other illegal
actions'' in three districts of Baku, Baku radio reported in a
dispatch monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. in London.
   It said soldiers fired warning shots Monday to break up the
gangs, and that ``three servicemen and a student of the Institute of
Medicine were wounded.''
   It did not say how they were hurt.
   Curfews were imposed in parts of Armenia, where ethnic tension
has increased between mixed Armenian and Azerbaijani populations.
   ``In regions of the republic the situation is extraordinarily
dangerous. There have been deaths in the Kalinin, Masis and Gugark
region,'' the newspaper Sotsialisticheskaya Industriya said today.
   An editor at the official Armenian news agency Armenpress, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed there had been new deaths
in the three regions, all located in northern Armenia. But he did
not know how many people died, or other details.
   Yerevan, the capital of Armenia, was reported to be quiet and a
10 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew that was imposed two weeks ago was reduced by
one hour on each end.
   But Sotsialisticheskaya Industriya said a curfew was imposed on
14 new regions of Armenia beginning at 11 p.m. Monday due to
increased tension in areas with a mixed population.
   Official reports have said more than 180,000 refugees have fled
both sides of the Armenian-Azerbaijani border in the past three
weeks because of the ethnic unrest.
   Armenian radio said Monday that 106,000 Armenians had fled
Azerbaijan, and Sotsialisticheskaya Industriya reported Monday that
the number of refugees from Armenia had reached 80,000.
   The Kremlin threatened Monday to fire and prosecute any Communist
Party officials or economic managers who dismiss workers in Armenia
and Azerbaijan for ethnic reasons.
   The toughly worded directive Monday from the central government's
Council of Ministers and the Communist Party Central Committee was
another step in the Kremlin's effort to impose order on the
republics.
   In February, ethnic rioting broke out in the Azerbaijani city of
Sumgait. At least 32 people, 26 Armenians and six Azerbaijanis, were
killed.
   Most Armenians are Christian, most Azerbaijanis are Moslem.

   Gunmen killed Peru's naval attache to
Bolivia on a downtown street today, and a previously unknown
extremist group claimed responsibility in a note left near his body,
witnesses said.
   A man and a woman grabbed Capt. Juan Vega Llona one block away
from the Peruvian Embassy, and one of them fired three shots at his
head, witnesses reported. Vega Llona died instantly.
   The man and the woman immediately left the site and have not been
found, the Ministry of the Interior said.
   Police mobilized units throughout La Paz in a effort to capture
the killers.
   A note left with the body signed by the Revolutionary Labor
Movement says ``This is our word against the imperialists that day
to day pretend to smother with blood the just struggles of the
people. In response to these veins full of blood today we make
justice, eliminating a bloody murderer of the people, naval attache
Juan Vega Llona.''
   The police and the U.S. Embassy in La Paz said they have no
knowledge of the Revolutionary Labor Movement.
   On Aug. 8, U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz escaped
injury when a bomb exploded as his motorcade drove into the Bolivian
capital.
   The leftist Simon Bolivar Command claimed responsibility for the
attack, which damaged three cars but caused no injuries. CIA
Director William H. Webster said drug traffickers were behind the
attack.
   Bolivian officials estimate the drug industry brings in $500
million annually, more than the $470 million brought in from all
legal exports.

<HEAD>Court Turns Down Unwed California Father Seeking Parental
Relationship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today shattered the hopes of
an unwed California father seeking to restore a parental
relationship with his 7-year-old daughter.
   Eight days after hearing arguments in Edward McNamara's case, the
court dismissed his appeal in a one-sentence decision: ``The appeal
is dismissed for want of a properly presented federal question.''
   There was no recorded dissent.
   In his appeal, McNamara contended that his parental rights had
been terminated unconstitutionally by San Diego authorities.
   The justices had been expected to use his case to decide whether
unwed fathers who actively seek custody of their children may be
stripped of all parental rights if adoption is deemed in the
children's best interest.
   McNamara, who is 42, no longer was seeking custody of his
daughter, Katie. He wanted to re-establish a parent-child
relationship so he could win visitation rights.
   McNamara and Katie's mother, unidentified in court records, had
not seen each other for eight months when Katie was born in 1981.
McNamara did not learn of the pregnancy or birth until he was told
that Katie, then a month old, had been placed in a foster home
awaiting adoption.
   He quickly sought custody.
   Katie was five months old before a trial was held on McNamara's
custody request, and a California judge ruled that it was in Katie's
best interest to stay with the foster parents with whom she had been
living.
   The foster parents wanted to adopt Katie, and the judge ruled
that the baby girl had ``bonded'' with them.
   The judge acknowledged that McNamara was a ``good parent (who)
can provide a good, loving home for the child.''
   The California Supreme Court reversed the ruling, stating that
custody could not be awarded to a non-parent unless awarding custody
of the child to one of its parents who sought custody would be
detrimental to the child.
   The state's highest court sent the case back to a trial court to
determine whether the passage of time had made an award of custody
to McNamara detrimental for Katie, by then adopted.
   The trial court in 1985 ruled against McNamara, and stripped him
of all parental rights to Katie. The judge, however, encouraged
Katie's adoptive parents to make McNamara part of her life.
   In arguments before the justices Nov. 28, McNamara's lawyer
contended that California law unfairly discriminates against unwed
fathers by making it more difficult for them to assert their rights
as parents.
   San Diego County had defended the state's policy of giving an
unwed mother the primary right to decide whether to surrender a chid
for adoption.
   ``Biology in and of itself does not create a substantial
relationship or create a parental right,'' Lloyd Harmon Jr. had
argued for the county.
   The case is McNamara vs. San Diego County Department of Social
Services, 87-5840.

<TEXT>
   Authorities investigating the suspicious
deaths of eight terminally ill nursing home patients focused today
on the means and motives of two former nurse's aides charged with
murder in two of the deaths.
   The arrests of Catherine May Wood and Gwendolyn Gail Graham
followed a two-month investigation into the deaths at the Alpine
Manor Nursing Home in this Grand Rapids suburb.
   Investigators believed at least some of the eight residents were
suffocated in their beds, said Walker Police Chief Walter Sprenger.
   Detectives investigated but were unable to confirm allegations
that the suspects began choosing their victims based on initials of
the victims' names, which they hoped to use to spell the word
``murder,'' Sprenger said.
   Walker police arrested Wood, 26, of Grand Rapids early Monday.
She was arraigned on two counts of open murder before 59th District
Judge Sherwin Venema, who ordered Wood held without bond in the Kent
County Jail pending a Dec. 16 preliminary examination.
   Wood could be sentenced to up to life in prison if convicted.
   Graham, 25, was arrested Sunday night in Tyler, Texas, about 100
miles southeast of Dallas. She was arraigned Monday in 7th District
Court in Tyler on one count of open murder before Judge Bill Coats,
who set bond at $1 million and returned Graham to the Smith County,
Texas, jail.
   Sprenger said he would seek Graham's extradition to Michigan on
the open murder count, which does not specify the degree.
   Wood was charged in the deaths of Marguerite Chambers, 60, and
Edith Cook, 98, and Graham was charged in the death of Cook. The two
patients were among about 40 Alpine Manor residents who died between
January and April 1987, when the eight suspicious deaths occurred,
said Ginny Seyferth, a nursing home spokeswoman.
   All eight deaths originally were attributed to natural causes,
and the bodies of three of the patients were cremated. But the
investigation _ which Sprenger said began after Wood's ex-husband
gave police information about the suspected killings _ led last week
to the exhumations of the bodies of Chambers and Cook.
   Autopsy results on both were inconclusive, but additional bodies
might be exhumed, Sprenger said.
   Sprenger said additional charges could be filed as the six other
suspicious deaths are examined. He said there did not appear to be
other suspects in the case.
   The police chief refused to label the deaths mercy killings but
would not speculate on a motive. ``A lot of this will come out
during the trial. I cannot share evidence that will be detrimental
to the case,'' he said.
   The chief refused to say whether either woman had confessed or
made any comment to authorities.
   Wood worked at Alpine Manor from July 1985 to October 1988, most
recently as a supervisor of nurses aides, Seyferth said. Graham
worked from June 1986 to June 1987 at the 208-patient facility, the
spokeswoman said.
   ``Both had very good reviews,'' Seyferth said. ``In patient
surveys, both were very well-liked by patients.''
   Graham returned to her native Texas and was hired in September
1987 at Mother Frances Hospital in Tyler, assistant hospital vice
president Beverly Mason said. Graham was fired Oct. 19 after
hospital officials learned of the investigation in Michigan, Mason
said.

   PLO chief Yasser Arafat conferred with a
group of American Jews today in a meeting arranged by the Swedish
government.
   The five-member Jewish delegation was mostly from the
International Center for Peace in the Middle East, a coalition of
leftist groups in Israel and abroad.
   The peace center advocates relinquishing by Israel of Arab
territory captured in the 1967 Mideast war, and many of its members
urge the Jerusalem government to talk directly with the PLO.
   The Jewish delegation met with Arafat at Haga Palace, an
18th-century government guest house usually reserved for heads of
state or Sweden's most important visitors.
   ``They are still talking,'' a PLO official told waiting reporters
more than two hours after the meeting began.
   The Israeli government refuses to talk to the PLO and has urged
its Jewish supporters in the United States not to do so.
   The international chairman of the peace center is Israel's former
foreign minister, Abba Eban. Its Israeli branch includes prominent
members of Eban's left-leaning Labor Party.
   The Swedish Foreign Ministry said the U.S. delegation was headed
by Rita Hauser, a New York lawyer and chairman of the peace center's
American branch.
   Other members were Drora Kass, the center's executive director;
executive board member Stanley Sheinbaum, an economist and publisher
from Los Angeles; Menachem Rosensaft, president of the Labor Zionist
Alliance and chairman of the Network of Children of Holocaust
Survivors; and Professor Avraham Udovitch, chairman of the
department for Near East Studies at Princeton University.
   Arafat's delegation included Mahmoud Darwish and Yasser
Abed-Rabbo, both members of the PLO executive committee, his
spokesman Bassam Abu Sharif and Akram Haniyeh, a former Palestinian
journalist who was expelled by Israel.
   Arafat, after being greeted at the airport by Foreign Minister
Sten Andersson, boarded a helicopter at Arlanda International
Airport bound for Haga Palace.
   Arafat's schedule was kept under wraps, apparently for security
reasons. Hundreds of police were mobilized for his protection.
   The Israeli Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem telephoned the Swedish
ambassador to lodge an official protest over the government's
invitation to the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Swedish Foreign Ministry spokesman Jens Odlander said Arafat's
trip was primarily to meet the Jewish group rather than to see
Swedish government leaders.
   ``We just arranged the opportunity for these two groups to
meet,'' he said.
   Arafat's visit to Sweden is his first to a Western country since
he was denied a U.S. visa to address this week's U.N. General
Assembly session in New York.
   The session on the Palestinian question was rescheduled for Dec.
13-15 in Geneva, the first time the assembly will meet outside the
United States in its 43-year history.

   Suspected Kurdish guerrillas killed an army
lieutenant, two non-commissioned officers and five soldiers in a
daylong shoot-out in southeast Siirt province, Anatolia News Agency
reported today.
   It was not immediately clear if any guerrillas were slain in the
clash that started Monday morning at Judi mountain, the agency said.
   It quoted security officials as saying army units first found the
bodies of a lieutenant, two sergeants and one soldier. Four soldiers
found wounded died later, Anatolia said.
   Kurdish guerrillas belong to the outlawed Kurdish Labor Party, a
Marxist group fighting to set up a separate Kurdish state in
southeast Turkey. Their cause has claimed the lives of 1,500 troops
and rebels since 1984.

<TEXT>
   A minister accused of killing his
girlfriend just hours before preaching a Sunday sermon pleaded
guilty to a reduced charge of manslaughter the day before his murder
trial was to begin.
   The Rev. Jonathan Hamlin entered the plea Monday in the July 3
shooting death of 24-year-old Lula Sims under an agreement with
prosecutors. A Jan. 6 sentencing date was set by Circuit Judge Rush
Clements, said Otha Jones, chief deputy in the Warren County
Sheriff's Department.
   Hamlin, a 24-year-old married man with three children, had been
living with Sims, according to investigators.
   Sheriff Paul Barrett has said Hamlin confessed to killing Sims, a
divorced mother of three, and led law enforcement officers to a
shallow grave in rural Jefferson County, about 40 miles southeast of
Vicksburg, where Sims' body was found about a week after she was
reported missing.
   Shocked members of the Zion Traveler Missionary Baptist Church,
one of three congregations led by Hamlin, had praised their pastor
as a ``first-class minister'' even after learning of the murder
charge.
   Hamlin's wife, Martha, did not answer questions in the case.
Under Mississippi law, one spouse cannot be forced to testify
against the other.
   Hamlin remains free until his sentencing on a $100,000 bond he
posted after his arrest, Jones said.

   The national Centers for Disease Control's
spending on AIDS is up 25 percent in the present fiscal year, while
the overall CDC budget is 27 percent higher than last year, the
agency said today.
   The budget approved by Congress for the 1989 fiscal year, which
began Oct. 1, includes $981.9 million for the CDC, said Gayle Lloyd,
a CDC spokeswoman. AIDS education and research programs account for
$382.3 million of the total, she said.
   In the 1988 fiscal year, the CDC budget was $771.8 million,
including $304.9 million for AIDS, Ms. Lloyd said.
   The Atlanta-based CDC compiles information and conducts research
on infectious diseases, including acquired immune deficiency
syndrome. AIDS has killed 44,590 people in the United States since
1981, according to the most recent CDC statistics.
   The CDC's AIDS programs are part of $1.3 billion included in the
federal government's budget to fight the disease this year.

<HEAD>Court Saves Mining Industry From Paying Some Benefits to Black Lung
Victims</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts grafs 18-24, In other action, with other cases</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today saved the coal mining
industry from paying potentially billions of dollars in additional
benefits to miners with black lung disease.
   But at the same time, the justices ruled that more than 8,000
miners with pending black lung claims may be eligible to receive
hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits.
   By a 5-4 vote, the court said that miners with less than 10 years
of work in the mines are eligible to claim benefits if there is
other evidence they are disabled. That class of workers is estimated
by the government to be around 8,000 to 10,000 miners.
   But the court also overturned a lower court ruling that could
have opened the way for claims by possibly more than 100,000 miners
seeking as much as $13.6 billion in benefits.
   The larger group is barred from receiving benefits because miners
in that class failed to pursue adminisrative remedies or to appeal
to the courts within the prescribed time, the justices ruled.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court, said Congress
never intended to exclude from benefit eligibility miners who worked
less than 10 years.
   ``We do not sit to determine what Congress ought to have done
given the evidence before it, but to apply what Congress enacted _
and ... the exclusion of short-term miners from the benefits...finds
no support in the statute,'' Scalia said.
   On the other hand, he continued, nothing in federal law requires
the government to reopen settled claims.
   ``There is not even a colorable basis for the contention that
Congress has imposed a duty to reconsider finally determined
claims,'' he said.
   He was joined by Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall,
Harry A. Blackmun and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   The four dissenters agreed that settled cases should not be
reopened. But they also said that miners with less than 10 years of
work are not entitled to the benefits.
   Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the dissenting opinion, joined by
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White and
Sandra Day O'Connor.
   The ruling is at least an important partial victory for the
Reagan administration, as well as the coal mining industry.
   The administration challenged a ruling by the 8th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals that Justice Department lawyers said could force
tremendous additional cost on the overburdened fund that pays black
lung benefits.
   The 8th Circuit court _ in the ruling overturned today _ said the
Department of Labor must take a fresh look at claims that were
denied in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The appeals court had
directed the department to use liberalized standards adopted by
Congress in 1977 to determine eligibility for benefits.
   Congress had previously created a special fund to pay off claims
by miners with black lung disease, also known as pneumoconiosis.
   Coal mine operators already owe the government some $3 billion
that has been loaned to the fund from the federal treasury.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Dismissed the appeal of an unwed California father seeking to
restore a parental relationship with his 7-year-old daughter.
   Eight days after hearing arguments in Edward McNamara's case, the
court dismissed the appeal ``for want of a properly presented
federal question.''

<HEAD>U.S. Sues New Mexico Over Information Given Indian Voters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government has sued the state
of New Mexico and Sandoval County for allegedly failing to give
Indian voters sufficient voting information in their native
languages.
   The Justice Department lawsuit filed Monday contends the state
and county violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act by failing to provide
interpreters and voter information in the Keres and Navajo tongues.
Keres is a Pueblo Indian language.
   The lawsuit said 8.2 percent of New Mexico's population and 27.3
percent of Sandoval County's population is Indian. The county
encompasses an area from the northern suburbs of Albuquerque toward
northwestern New Mexico.
   ``I hope this litigation shakes the state up,'' said state Rep.
James Roger Madalena of Sandoval, a Jemez Pueblo Indian.
   The Justice Department asked the U.S. District Court to require
state and local election officials to devise a bilingual election
program that will assure Indians equal access to voter registration
and absentee voting, and provide them information on how names are
removed from voting lists.
   The Justice Department also said the defendants failed to
implement procedures to give residents of isolated Navajo and Pueblo
areas the chance to register, to obtain and cast absentee ballots
and to avoid having their registration canceled.
   Other defendants are Secretary of State Rebecca Vigil-Giron,
Sandoval County Clerk Nettie Lucero-Griego and Sandoval County
Commission Chairman Tom Swisstack.
   The Justice Department said it sued after months of discussion
with state and county officials in an effort to get the defendants
to resolve the problems voluntarily.
   Ms. Lucero-Griego said Monday she was not aware the suit had been
filed. Randy Childress, chief assistant New Mexico attorney general,
said he had not seen the lawsuit and would have no comment until it
could be reviewed.
   Ms. Vigil-Giron said the state was warned of a lawsuit as early
as 1987. She said her office tried to get some changes made to state
law, and had hired Indians to address concerns of Navajo, Apache and
Pueblo voters.
   ``We've gone to great lengths to solve some of these problems,''
she said.
   But she said some concepts cannot be translated into all Indian
languages, such as defining a constitutional amendment.
   ``Basically, it's an interpretation problem that we have,'' she
said.
   Madalena said Keres is a spoken language only; it has no
alphabet. But he said Navajo is both spoken and written.
   Swisstack said the county had advertised for interpreters, but
nobody applied. Sandoval County attorney Tom Garde said the county
was targeted because it has the highest percentage of Indian
residents in the state.

<BYLINE>By RAFAEL CANDANEDO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An opposition party has charged
Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriego supported the leader of a
failed rebellion in Argentina, who they say was a Noriega military
adviser.
   Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter on Monday called the accusations
``a fairy tale.''
   The Christian Democratic Party charged that Argentine Col.
Mohamed Ali Seineldin left Panama on a Panamanian military plane,
flew to Uruguay and took a boat to Buenos Aires to take over the
coup.
   However, Ritter said the Argentine left the Panama City airport
on a commercial flight last week.
   The insurrection that began Thursday was the third army mutiny in
20 months.
   Ritter also said the Argentine government will show ``the
falseness'' of versions connecting the Panamanian Defense Forces to
Seineldin's rebellion.
   ``It seems like a fairy tale, although a tragicomic one, that
every important event in Latin America, large or small, is tied to
Gen. Noriega,'' Ritter said.
   The Christian Democratic Party has called for Noriega to step
down. Noriega's rule is also opposed by the United States, where he
has been indicted on drug trafficking charges _ charges he denies.
   On Monday, Acting President Manuel Solis Palma sent a message of
solidarity to Argentine President Raul Alfonsin, the presidential
press office said.
   Seineldin was Argentina's military attache in Panama from 1985 to
1987 and also served as an instructor for the Defense Forces,
official Panamanian sources said.
   Sources at the Argentine Embassy in Panama said that Seineldin
left his post as military attache in 1986 and then was invited to be
a Defense Forces instructor.
   In a press release issued Monday the Christian Democratic Party
said, ``Col. Seineldin was a military adviser to Gen. Noriega for
the past two years, a fact that shows a direct tie between the
Panamanian military chief and the events in Argentina.''
   The party also claimed Seineldin was involved in repressive
actions against anti-government demonstrators in Panama.
   The press release alleged that ties between Noriega and
Seineldin's rebellion indicate ``an attitude of vengeance'' because
Alfonsin favored excluding Panama from the Group of Eight.
   The Panamanian government was excluded from the Group of Eight, a
group of eight Latin American democracies that consult on mutual
problems, on the grounds that it was not a democracy after Noriega
removed Eric DelValle as president in February.

<TEXT>
   Switzerland's highest court today
ordered the bank records of an Israeli arms dealer involved in the
Iran-Contra affair turned over to U.S. investigators.
   The Federal Tribunal, the nation's supreme court, lifted strict
banking secrecy rules in rejecting Yakov Nimrodi's appeal of a
decision by Swiss police to grant legal assistance in the
investigation.
   Nimrodi, an Israeli businessman, told the court his account at
the Geneva branch of Credit Suisse Bank was used to channel $1
million in Israeli funds to an account controlled by former White
House aide Oliver North. The Swiss account was code-named
``Trans-Eagle.''
   One of the judges, who cannot be identified under court practice,
said the money apparently came from arms shipments. He did not
elaborate.
   Nimrodi said he was acting on a secret mission for the Israeli
government. The court rejected his arguments that as middleman he
was an uninvolved third party and should be granted immunity.
   In August of last year, the Federal Tribunal ordered secrecy
lifted on accounts at Credit Suisse linked to other figures involved
in U.S. arms sales to Iran and diversion of the funds to Contra
rebels in Nicaragua.
   Those figures were Richard Secord, a retired U.S. Air Force
general; his associate, Iranian-born businessman Albert Hakim; and
Iranian arms dealer Manucher Ghorbanifar.
   Swiss authorities gave the records to U.S. investigators last
November.

<TEXT>
   The FBI announced today that 93 people tied to
two Colombian drug cartels have been charged with importing cocaine,
heroin and marijuana into the United States.
   The people charged in the United States and abroad shipped drugs
from South and Central America and other Caribbean countries and
distributed the drugs through a network stretching from Miami to New
York, Los Angeles and Europe, the FBI said.
   U.S. attorneys' offices in Miami and Tampa, Fla., assisted in the
investigation and most of the 93 were being charged in those two
cities, the FBI said.
   The operation, codenamed Cat-Com, led to the seizure of 11,000
pounds of cocaine, 211,000 pounds of marijuana and some heroin,
according to the FBI.
   The yearlong investigation ``is the largest undercover operation
ever directed toward the interworkings of the drug cartels based in
Medellin and Cali, Colombia,'' FBI Director William Sessions said in
a statement.
   More than $1 million in cash and property has been seized and
total seizures are expected to exceed $4 million, said the FBI
director.
   Sessions said undercover agents posed as experts in the
communications field and equipped the traffickers with
state-of-the-art electronic gadgetry, enabling the agents to
identify leaders and assets possessed by the organizations.
   The traffickers identified themselves to undercover agents as
transporting drugs on behalf of cocaine-trafficking cartels headed
by Colombian drug lords Pablo Escobar-Gaviria, Jorge Luis
Ochoa-Vasques and Jose Gonzalo Rodrigues-Gacha.
   U.S. naval warships and U.S. Coast Guard cutters acted on
information provided by the FBI undercover operation to interdict
vessels carrying the drugs headed for the United States from South
America.
   In one instance, a sailboat named Naut-For-Fun was piloted by FBI
sources hired by the drug traffickers. The sailboat contained nearly
900 pounds of cocaine from Colombia.
   The FBI had planned to seize the drugs covertly and tell the
traffickers that the sailboat had sunk with the crew lost at sea.
When bad weather hit, however, the Coast Guard interceded, rescuing
the FBI and civilian personnel aboard from the sailboat, which sunk,
and recovering the cocaine.

<TEXT>
   The National Transportation Safety Board has
published its final report on the crash of Continental Flight 1713,
reaffirming the board's opinion that human error caused the accident
during takeoff in a snowstorm.
   The report reaffirmed the NTSB investigators' opinion that the
crash, which killed 28 of the plane's 82 passengers and crew
members, including the captain and first officer, was caused by the
captain's failure to de-ice the aircraft after a takeoff delay in
steady snowfall.
   It reiterated their opinion that confusion between the flight
crew and air traffic controllers contributed to the accident by
helping to delay the takeoff.
   The report, issued Monday, also restated the investigators'
belief that another contributing factor was ``the absence of
regulatory or management controls'' which led to the pairing of the Continental
DC-9, bound for Boise, Idaho, crashed on takeoff
Nov. 15, 1987, at Stapleton International Airport.
   The 90-page report puts in written form what the board discussed
on Sept. 27 during its probable-cause hearing on the crash.
   The formal report reaffirms earlier findings that the accident
resulted from a combination of errors by inexperienced pilots Frank
Zvonek, 43, and Lee Bruecher, 26, and the weather.
   Bruecher, who was at the controls, was faulted for lifting the
nose too soon and causing the plane to stall. He had completed just
36 hours of flight time _ including simulator practice _ on the DC-9
and had not flown at all in the 24 days prior to the crash.
   Zvonek was an experienced Boeing 737 co-pilot, but had only
limited DC-9 flight time. He was faulted for failing to return the
plane for a second spray of de-icing fluid even though it sat on the
ground in snow and freezing temperatures for 27 minutes before
takeoff.

   Leftist guerrillas attacked two
major army bases in eastern El Salvador, according to rebel and
armed forces reports today.
   The rebels said the attacks on the bases near San Miguel marked
the beginning of a new offensive against the U.S.-backed government.
   The Marxist-led insurgents said on their clandestine Radio
Venceremos they inflicted 28 casualties on government troops Monday
night in an attack on the 3rd brigade headquarters in the provincial
capital of San Miguel. The report did not distinguish between killed
and wounded.
   Lt. Salvador Gonzalez Quezada, spokesman for the 3rd brigade,
said no government soldiers were killed or wounded in the attack. A
civilian woman was wounded during fighting outside the brigade
compound, he said.
   Gonzalez said four guerrilla mortar rounds fell inside the
brigade compound and four other rounds struck the grounds of the
elite Arce battalion, which is attached to the brigade.
   He said the rounds caused no damages and that rebels did not
penetrate the grounds.
   Guerrillas using incendiary bombs destroyed two stores in San
Miguel before retreating, said Gonzalez.
   Early today, rebels attacked the army's 4th detachment in Gotera,
15 miles north of San Miguel. The Armed Forces Press Committee said
one soldier was wounded in what it called guerrilla ``harassment''
of the base.
   The rebel radio broadcast said the attack on Gotera was part of
the eastern offensive. It did not provide a casualty report.
   The radio station YSU reported from Gotera that two civilians
were wounded there. It said they were in ``grave'' condition.
   Radio Venceremos said the attacks marked the beginning of a
regional offensive dubbed ``Fire of the Power and Organization of
the People on its March Toward Victory.''
   San Miguel, with 155,000 people, is El Salvador's third largest
city. It lies 85 miles east of San Salvador, the capital.
   A 9-year-old civil war between the guerrillas and the U.S.-backed
government has killed an estimated 65,000 people, most of them
civilians.

   A real estate magnate who at first made a
bid for PTL's assets thinks the price being asked for what remains
of the evangelical empire is too high, according to his spokesman.
   Bob Ransford, a spokesman for Canadian Peter Thomas, said Monday
that Thomas does not plan to attend the Dec. 12 auction at U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Columbia.
   Ransford told The Herald newspaper of Rock Hill that the
conditions set by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds made a bid by
Thomas unlikely.
   Thomas, who heads the Vancouver-based Samoth Capital Corp.,
expressed interest in buying PTL's assets in August. At a Nov. 17
bankruptcy hearing, Reynolds rejected Thomas' $70 million cash bid
because it was not high enough and it allowed him to walk away from
the deal for up to 30 days.
   Ransford said Thomas plans to see what happens at the Dec. 12
auction and a Dec. 13 hearing before making any more decisions
concerning the Heritage USA park owned by PTL in Fort Mill.
   Thomas' withdrawal from the auction makes Canadian Stephen
Mernick the leading bidder.
   Coffin would not comment on whether Mernick had altered his $115
million proposal, a proposal Reynolds ruled against because Mernick
would not make an unrefundable deposit or alter terms of a $65
million mortgage payment.
   Meanwhile, Heritage Ministries President Sam Johnson said his
group has raised $1.5 million toward buying Heritage USA and hopes
to have raised $5 million by Friday.

<HEAD>Ways and Means Chairman Suggests Hikes in Gas, Benefits Taxes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee, today suggested raising the gasoline tax
and the amount of Social Security benefits subject to tax as ways to
reduce the federal budget deficit.
   However, the Illinois Democrat emphasized that it would be up to
President-elect George Bush _ not the Democratic-controlled Congress
_ to initiative any tax increase. Rostenkowski was having lunch with
Bush today.
   Rostenkowski, whose committee has jurisdiction over taxes and a
sizable share of federal spending programs, predicted Bush would
have little trouble backing away from his no-tax-increase pledge if
he wants to do so.
   Rostenkowski made his remarks at a breakfast meeting with several
reporters. Aides relayed his statements to other reporters.
   A spokesman said Rostenkowski suggested the federal gasoline tax,
now 9.1 cents a gallon, could be raised by 10 to 15 cents a gallon.
A 15-cent increase would bring in about $15 billion a year, almost
enough by itself to meet the tax-increase requirements of any
deficit-reduction package that Congress and the executive branch
might agree on.
   Raising the amount of Social Security benefits subject to income
tax would require many politicians of both parties to abandon
pledges not to tinker with the retirement system. Present law taxes
up to half of a retiree's benefits if a couple has total income over
$32,000 or a single person's income is over $25,000.
   Senior congressional Democrats have repeatedly rejected arguments
from President Reagan and Bush that the $150-billion-a-year deficit
can be reduced significantly without raising taxes. However,
Democrats have refused to initiate tax increases without the backing
of the administration.
   Rostenkowski contends a continued high deficit will destabilize
the economy to the extend that the nation's standard of living will
suffer.
   At the meeting with reporters, aides said, Rostenkowski also
announced that his committee will hold hearings on the wave of
corporate buyouts. The key issue for the committee will be whether a
full interest deduction should continue to be allowed for money
borrowed to finance buyouts and takeovers.
   Rostenkowski said he has an open mind on the question, aides said.
   The chairman also repeated his distaste for Bush's prposal to
reduce the maximum tax on capital gains. The lion's share of a
capital-gains tax cut would fall to the wealthy, and Rostenkowski
contends such a move would jeopardize the consensus that produced
the 1986 tax overhaul.
   Meanwhile, speaking at a breakfast sponsored by the Gannett Co.
Inc., the incoming chairman of the Senate Budget Committee predicted
that Bush would have to ask for a tax increase before the midway
point of his term.
   ``My view is there will be additional taxes ... within the next
two years,'' said Sen. James R. Sasser, D-Tenn. Bush would again ask
people to ``read my lips,'' he said, but this time he'll be saying,
``Let's get some additional revenue in the till.''

   within five hours of beginning a crackdown on companies with unpaid
fines for safety violations.
   ``We have troopers at all 10 of the truck scales in the state,
and they're checking every truck that rolls in,'' said Lt. Mike
Edmonson, director of the motor safety division. ``We have a list of
220 companies with unpaid penalties ranging from $100 to several
thousand dollars.''
   State police began issuing fines after a year of warnings,
Edmonson said.
   ``We spent the entire year of 1987 issuing warnings. We sent out
over 20,000 warning letters both in state and out of Louisiana.
Since Jan. 1, we've been issuing civil penalties,'' he said.
   Officers will stay at the scales around the clock for an extended
period, Edmonson said.
   ``They may wait us out for eight hours or 12 hours or even 24.
But they want those trucks rolling. It costs them money if they're
not. They won't be able to wait us out forever,'' he said.
   Violations include faulty brakes, bad tires or lights and drivers
who have been behind the wheel too many hours, Edmonson said.
   ``We're not asking them to do anything additional to operate
their trucks than is required under state law. Our main concern is
the growing number cidents in the
state. We're trying to stop trucks in bad shape before they drive
through Louisiana,'' Edmonson said.
   ``For the most part, truckers comply with regulations,'' Edmonson
said. ``It's not a large number of companies violating them, but we
don't want it to get any larger.''

<TEXT>
   A fired FBI agent has been jailed for refusing
to testify against two Teamsters officials charged with embezzlement
and racketeering.
   Robert S. Friedrick was taken to the downtown Justice Center jail
by federal marshals Monday after he refused to answer prosecutors'
questions about his role as the agency's chief contact for late
Teamsters union President Jackie Presser when Presser served as FBI
informant.
   U.S. District Court Judge George W. White, who had allowed
Friedrick to remain free on $1,000 bond Friday after refusing to
testify under immunity, revoked the bond and asked Friedrick if he
had experienced a change of heart.
   ``My position is the same as Friday,'' said Friedrick, whom the
FBI fired in August 1986.
   Friedrick, who could be jailed up to 18 months for criminal
contempt, conferred briefly with his attorney, William D. Beyer,
before giving him the contents of his pockets, making a phone call
and leaving for jail.
   Beyer has appealed the judge's contempt citation to the 6th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati.
   Government attorneys indicated they wanted to call Friedrick to
the stand to prove that Presser's FBI ``handlers'' had never
authorized the union hiring of ``ghost employees'' who were paid for
doing no work.
   The handlers were assigned to keep in contact with Presser and
receive his informant's reports on union activities.
   Friedrick was fired after he was indicted for making false
statements when he told investigators in 1985 that the ghost
employees had been authorized by the FBI. In January 1986, Friedrick
admitted that he had lied about the authorization, but his attorney
has been able to suppress the admission.
   Stephen H. Jigger, a government prosecutor, said Friedrick's
testimony was crucial because Friedrick sometimes was the only one
of three FBI Presser ``handlers'' who attended meetings with Presser
and Anthony Hughes, a co-defendant and recording secretary of
Teamsters Local 507 in Cleveland.
   Hughes and Harold Friedman, a Teamsters international vice
president and president of Local 507, are charged with plotting a
$700,000 scheme to hire ``ghost employees.'' Presser, who remained
secretary-treasurer of his hometown Local 507 while Teamsters
president, was indicted on similar charges but died July 9 before
going on trial.
   Jigger asked the judge to consider delaying the trial to give
Friedrick time behind bars to reconsider his unwillingness to
testify.
   But White delayed such a ruling, and excused the jury until
Wednesday while attorneys argued whether the jury can see some
prosecution evidence.
   As an alternative to Friedrick's testimony on the stand, Jigger
tried but lost a bid to have three sworn statements by Friedrick
admitted as evidence. The judge said the material was untrustworthy
because of Friedrick's earlier conflicting statements.

   A moderate earthquake shook the Cook Inlet
area early today, but there were no reports of damage or injuries,
the Tsunami Warning Center said.
   Spokesman Alec Medbery said the 7:12 a.m. quake, with a
preliminary magnitude of 5.0 on the Richter scale, was centered
about 50 miles west of Homer and was felt as far north as Anchorage.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus, a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 time
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage
in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6
severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
   The 1964 ``Good Friday'' earthquake in Alaska measured 8.5 on the
Richter scale and was centered in Prince William Sound. It generated
large waves that devastated several coastal communities and killed
114 people as far south as Oregon and Hawaii.

   The Navy has called off a search for an
electronic warfare plane that failed to return from a training
mission 900 miles off the West Coast and said today the four crewmen
were presumed lost.
   Several pieces of debris were spotted from search aircraft but
sank before they could be recovered, said Navy spokesman Lt. Gordon
Hume. The search was ended at 5:30 p.m. Monday, he said.
   The EA6-B ``Prowler'' took off from the aircraft carrier USS
Constellation late Sunday and was declared overdue early Monday,
prompting a sea and air search, said Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Bob
Pritchard said.
   The twin-engine jet was assigned to Tactical Electronics Warfare
Squadron VAQ-139 at the Whidbey Island (Wash.) Naval Air Station,
said Public Affairs Officer Howard Thomas at Whidbey Island.
   The area where the aircraft was lost is open sea with no place to
land.
   It was one of 13 EA6 planes based at Whidbey Island, about 50
miles north of Seattle, and the fourth from the base to be lost this
year, Thomas said.
   The Grumman-made EA6-B carries equipment capable of jamming enemy
radar, Pritchard said.
   It was accompanying the San Diego-based Constellation on a
six-month deployment to the western Pacific. The carrier left San
Diego last Thursday, said Pritchard.
   Names of the four crewmen were withheld pending notification of
relatives.

   President Reagan will hold a prime-time news
conference Thursday, the White House announced today, in what will
apparently be his last formal session with reporters.
   The news conference will be held at 8 p.m. EST in the East Room
of the White House, said spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``Be nice. It's his last one,'' first lady Nancy Reagan, told
reporters as she accepted the official White House Christmas tree.
   The session will come a day after Reagan's meeting in New York
with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and will likely be
Reagan's last such formal news conference before he leaves office
Jan. 20.
   It will be his fifth meeting with reporters this year and the
first in nearly six months.
   Reagan held news conferences in Washington on Feb. 24 and May 17,
and then held formal question-and-answer sessions with reporters
covering his Moscow summit with Gorbachev on June 1 and at the close
of the seven-nation economic summit in Toronto on June 21.

   First lady Nancy Reagan said today there really
isn't any ``fussing and feuding'' between her and Raisa Gorbachev.
   Mrs. Reagan answered reporters' questions as she received the
White House Christmas tree, an 18-foot balsam fir presented by tree
farmers Irv and Alyce Daggett of Montello, Wis., on behalf of the
National Christmas Tree Association.
   When asked if she was looking forward to seeing Mrs. Gorbachev,
with whom she will attend a lunch in New York on Wednesday while
President Reagan and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev meet on
Governors Island, she said, ``Yes, I am.''
   ``I hope she has a good time in New York,'' Mrs. Reagan said.
``She has a wonderful time to go there.''
   Did she have any special message for Mrs. Gorbachev?
   ``Merry Christmas,'' she said.
   Asked if there was a feud between her and the Soviet leader's
wife, who have appeared to greet each other frostily at times, Mrs.
Reagan said, ``You all keep saying that there's ... fussing and
feuding, but there really isn't.''
   ``I think too much attention is being paid to it,'' she said.
   As to retirement plans, she said she and her husband are both
writing books and both plan to do some speaking, among other things.
When asked if they would be traveling abroad, she said, ``Probably.''
   Mrs. Reagan said she and the president will celebrate Christmas
at the White House on Dec. 22, the day before they leave for a
Christmas and New Year's vacation in California.
   She said they were giving each other furniture for the house they
will move into in Los Angeles after the president's term ends Jan.
20.
   The first lady said she had mixed feelings about leaving the
White House.
   ``It's sentimental, really,'' she said. ``There are some things I
will be glad to get rid of and some things I won't be glad to get
rid of.''
   She said she would especially miss some friends, the White House
telephone operators and Air Force One, the presidential airplane.
   A reporter asked if she would miss the press.
   ``In a way,'' Mrs. Reagan said. ``I think somewhere out there are
some good friends. Yes, I will.''
   The first lady wore a green cloth coat that she has worn at each
Christmas season that she has been in the White House.
   Noting the numerous events of a nostalgic nature that she and her
husband have been attending, Mrs. Reagan said, ``If there are many
more tributes, I think I will be washed away.''
   When a reporter noted that the president will hold a press
conference Thursday night, she said, ``Be nice. It's his last one.''

   Veteran party activist Ronald H. Brown entered
the crowded race to become Democratic national chairman today,
saying he was his ``own man'' despite close ties with presidential
hopeful Jesse Jackson.
   Brown declared himself the front-runner in the competition to
succeed outgoing chairman Paul Kirk. His rivals, either announced or
unannounced, include Michigan Chairman Richard Wiener and former
Reps. Jim Jones of Oklahoma; Mike Barnes of Maryland and Jim Stanton
of Ohio.
   Brown said he would campaign as an ``independent, mainstream
progressive Democrat'' who was proud of his work on the past
presidential campaigns of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, Walter F. Mondale,
Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis.
   Brown said he would ``certainly welcome the support of Jesse
Jackson's supporters,'' but took pains to declare his political
independence.
   ``I'm nobody's candidate. I'm my own man,'' the Washington lawyer
said at a news conference.
   Brown, who was Jackson's top aide at the Democratic National
Convention last summer, said he would be neutral in the race for the
1992 presidential nomination if he became chairman. ``No one will be
given an advantage,'' he said.
   Wiener also arranged to meet with reporters during the day to
discuss his candidacy.
   Among the others, Barnes declared his candidacy in a mailgram
sent to Democrats by his state's governor and senators on Monday.
   Jones, who advocates a three-year television advertising campaign
leading to the 1992 presidential election, said he would make a
formal announcement next week. Stanton has been exploring a race and
said late Monday he was ``looking forward to a candidacy.''
   The Democratic National Committee meets Feb. 9-10 in Washington
to select a new chairman, and Kirk's departure created the potential
for a free-for-all struggle to lead the party that has lost five of
the last six presidential elections.
   ``It makes it much more difficult to arrive at a choice without
some bloodshed,'' Democratic Sen. Lloyd M. Bentsen of Texas said
Monday after Kirk's announcement that he would step aside.
   In contrast to the Democratic maneuverings, Republicans are
expected to ratify without dissent President-elect George Bush's
selection of campaign manager Lee Atwater to be GOP national
chairman.
   Kirk exited at a news conference in Washington where he said the
Democratic Party is better off politically and financially than it
was four years ago. He said he decided when he took the job in 1985
that he would keep it for four years. ``My purpose was to give
something back and to leave something better than existed before I
was given the honor and the opportunity to serve,'' he said.
   Kirk said he will practice law when his term ends in February but
that he will not become a ``political dropout.''
   He said he expects a ``spirited contest'' among the candidates to
replace him, but brushed aside forecasts of a bloodletting. The
Democratic National Committee meets in Washington Feb. 9-10 to make
its selection.
   Bentsen, who was the party's vice presidential candidate this
fall, said Kirk's decision ``makes it much more difficult to arrive
at a choice without some bloodshed. ... Paul was my candidate,''
said the Texas senator, who joined a chorus of party officials
praising Kirk's work.
   Newly elected Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said, ``I
and many other Democrats across the country will miss Paul's
leadership.''
   Kirk, a 50-year-old Massachusetts native, was urged publicly and
privately by party officials to accept a second four-year term, in
part to head off a battle shortly after the loss of the presidential
campaign.

   Jim Bakker and a former top PTL aide
defrauded 150,000 contributors and used more than $4 million in
contributions to the TV ministry to support extravagant lifestyles,
an indictment charges.
   Two other Bakker aides also were indicted for alleged tax evasion.
   Bakker and Richard Dortch, PTL's former senior executive vice
president, used fraudulent means to sell lifetime partnerships in
the ministry's Heritage USA theme park, a federal grand jury said
Monday after a 15-month investigation.
   A lawyer for the television evangelist said today that Bakker
will plead innocent.
   Bakker ``has indicated he is wholly comfortable with the
honorable character of the way Heritage USA was operated under his
leadership and desires to see its ministry restored and continue,''
his attorney, Jim Toms, said in a telephone interview from his
Hendersonville office.
   ``They're written in pretty complex language,'' he said of the
charges. ``It's going to take some real careful study to understand
the implications.''
   Bakker, who founded the ministry in 1972 and built it into one of
the nation's most popular evangelical enterprises, and Dortch are
charged with eight counts of mail fraud, 15 counts of wire fraud and
one count of conspiring to commit mail and wire fraud for using the
mails, telephones and television.
   If convicted of all the charges, Bakker, 48, and Dortch, 57, each
could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined $6 million.
   Bakker's wife, Tammy, a target of the investigation, was not
indicted.
   Bakker left the ministry in March 1987 after admitting to a 1980
sexual encounter with church secretary Jessica Hahn. The indictment
alleges that Dortch authorized a $265,000 payment to Ms. Hahn to
keep her quiet about the incident.
   Bakker's attorneys, Toms and Ryan Hovis, told reporters Monday
that Bakker would not have a statement for several days.
   ``Certainly there's a degree of discouragement or regret that
criminal charges were brought against Mr. Bakker,'' Toms said. ``But
he's glad to know what he's facing, so he can prepare his defense.''
   Dortch told reporters in Clearwater, Fla., where he runs a
ministry called Life Challenges, that he looked forward to being
able ``to tell my side of the story and to put this matter behind me
and with God's help I know that I can face the future.''
   U.S. Attorney Thomas Ashcraft declined to comment, saying,
``There has already been too much publicity on this already and we
don't want any more.''
   Ms. Hahn, who works for a radio station in Phoenix, told a news
conference she is willing to testify in court, but otherwise wants
nothing to do with the case.
   ``I have lived with this for eight years,'' she said. ``I refuse
to be a slave to this any longer.''
   Two months after Bakker left PTL, his Pentecostal denomination,
the Assemblies of God, dismissed him and Dortch.
   According to the indictment, the Bakkers received bonuses
totaling $3,465,000 from 1984 through 1987, and Dortch got bonuses
totaling $550,000 although they were aware PTL was in poor financial
condition.
   The Bakkers returned to the Charlotte area in June, mounting an
unsuccessful attempt to buy PTL, which filed for bankruptcy
reorganization three months after Bakker left the ministry.
   A U.S. Bankruptcy Court has been trying to find a suitable buyer
for PTL's 1,700 acres of undeveloped property, satellite television
network and Heritage USA theme park in Fort Mill, S.C, just over the
North Carolina line.
   The indictment said Bakker and Dortch raised at least $158
million from the lifetime partnerships sold to finance construction
of a hotel at the theme park. PTL sold the partnerships from 1984
until spring 1987, promising free yearly lodging at the theme park
in return for a one-time gift, usually $1,000.
   More than 152,000 partnerships were sold.
   The indictment said Bakker and Dortch oversold those
partnerships, didn't tell partners about it and misled PTL board
members about the ministry's finances.
   Also indicted Monday were David Taggart, a former PTL vice
president, and his brother, James, a former interior designer for
PTL. They are accused of diverting more than $1.1 million in PTL
money for their own use, including $55,000 in purchases from the
Cartier jewelry store in New York, and not reporting the income to
the Internal Revenue Service.
   The defendants were ordered to appear Dec. 15 in U.S. District
Court.
   The maximum penalty for each count of mail fraud, wire fraud,
conspiracy and tax evasion is five years in prison and a $250,000
fine and five years.
   On Nov. 10, the Bakkers and David Taggart were ordered by a
federal judge in Columbia, S.C., to repay nearly $7.7 million to PTL
as restitution for excessive pay and benefits they received between
1984 and 1987.
   The Bakkers were ordered to repay $6.6 million of that. Bakker's
attorneys have said they will appeal the decision.

   The Portuguese branch of the Red Cross
will set up a nursing school in the former headquarters of the
once-feared secret police, a Red Cross spokesman said Tuesday.
   The two buildings in Lisbhad been
occupied by the police force used by Portugal's rightist
dictatorship to supress opposition before a bloodless revolution
restored the country to democracy in 1974.
   The buildings are occupied by a commission investigating the
activities of the secret police, which had detained and tortured
thousands of political prisoners on orders of dictator Antonio
Salazar.
   No date has been set for the transfer of the Red Cross to the
buildings, which are owned by Dom Duarte of Braganza, the head of
Portugal's dethroned royal family.

   The ex-lover of a man accused of beating to death
their illegally adopted daughter testified today under
cross-examination that she used heroin, marijuana and cocaine and
believed in the powers of hypnosis.
   In an effort to discredit star witness Hedda Nussbaum's
testimony, the attorney for murder defendant Joel Steinberg
questioned Ms. Nussbaum about her drug use and her involvement with
cults and programming.
   Ms. Nussbaum, who lived with Steinberg for 17 years until the
death a year ago of 6-year-old Lisa Steinberg, has directly
implicated him in Lisa's death and painted him as a bullying drug
abuser.
   Under questioning by defense lawyer Ira London, Ms. Nussbaum said
that hypnotic suggestions and programming led her to believe that
she had had ``sex with everybody in the world.''
   Ms. Nussbaum testified that she once believed in the power of
hypnosis and of post-hypnotic buzz words, which when heard could
trigger certain actions.
   ``I was hypnotizing everyone ... and was using them sexually,''
M. Nussbaum said.
   At that point, London asked her if he detected the beginnings of
a smile on her face.
   ``Yes,'' she said. ``I just realized the absurdity of it.''
   Her testimony came one day after state Supreme Court Justice
Harold Rothwax denied a defense motion to change Steinberg's plea to
not guilty by reason of insanity. The Supreme Court is New York's
trial-level court.
   London argued that Ms. Nussbaum's testimony last week convinced
psychiatrists that Steinberg was not criminally responsible for
killing the girl.
   Last week, Ms. Nussbaum testified that Steinberg had admitted
knocking the girl down because she was staring at him.
   ``We are not abandoning our defense that Joel Steinberg is not
guilty of depraved indifference homicide,'' London said.
   He said he wanted his motion granted so the jury could consider a
verdict of innocent by reason of insanity.
   ``We are offering our motion as an alternative,'' London said.
   Assistant District Attorney Peter Casolaro strongly opposed the
plea change, calling it a ``strategic decision'' that should not be
granted.
   Rothwax denied the request, at least temporarily. He noted that
insanity defenses ordinarily must be filed before a trial begins and
within 30 days after a defendant enters a plea to an indictment.
   But the court has discretion to permit an insanity defense at any
time after an indictment. Rothwax said he would give the defense the
opportunity to resubmit it with ``proper papers.''
   Lisa's death in a household with affluent, well-educated adults
shocked many and led to a re-examination of the duty and ability of
neighbors, teachers and social workers to recognize and report
evidence of child abuse.
   In testimony Monday, Ms. Nussbaum said for the first time that
she had seen Steinberg physically abuse Lisa.
   Several weeks before the girl's death, she testified, ``Joel
grabbed Lisa by the arms and shoulders, shook her and threw her down
on the floor.''
   Casolaro asked her if she had ever hit Lisa or physically abused
her.
   ``No,'' Ms. Nussbaum replied.
   On cross-examination, London tried to suggest that Ms. Nussbaum's
opinion of Steinberg had been influenced by her lawyer, Barry
Scheck, and physicians, including psychiatrist Louis Opler.
   ``The only thing that I can recall is that he (Opler) indicated
Joel was a sociopath,'' she said.
   When London asked her if she knew what Opler meant by sociopath,
she chuckled for the first time in her three days on the witness
stand. She said she did not understand at the time that it meant a
violently anti-social personality.
   Under further questioning, she said that when she first talked to
Scheck about testifying against Steinberg, she had, ``for the most
part,'' a positive view of Steinberg.
   She testified that Scheck eventually told her he was trying to
come to some sort of written agreement about testifying against
Steinberg.
   Scheck said afterward that prosecutors had decided before the
agreement that Ms. Nussbaum had nothing to do with Lisa's death and
that the agreement was not in exchange for testimony against
Steinberg.
   London also asked Ms. Nussbaum about her $3.6 million civil suit
against Steinberg.
   ``Were you made aware that a successful criminal prosecution ...
against Joel Steinberg would enhance the value of your lawsuit?''
London asked.
   ``I thought one case would have no influence on the other,'' she
said, adding that Scheck had told her that.

   The 16 medium-range cruise missiles
based at Florennes air force base will be gone by Dec. 13, the
Defense Ministry said Tuesday.
   Defense Minister Guy Coeme and U.S. Ambassador Maynard W. Glitman
invited reporters to watch the removal of the last missile on
Belgian soil on that day.
   Under a 1979 NATO decision, 48 cruise missiles were to have been
deployed in Belgium, but the treaty signed a year ago by President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev stopped the deployment
after only 16 had been based.
   Florennes is 40 miles south of Brussels.

   A B-52 bomber crashed and burst into
flames early today on a runway while practicing ``touch-and-go''
landings at K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base, officials said. All eight
crew members survived.
   The plane, normally equipped to carry nuclear bombs, crashed
about 1:15 a.m., said Lt. Naomi Siegal, a spokeswoman at the
Strategic Air Command installation.
   No weapons were aboard, said Lt. Col. George Peck, a spokesman
for SAC headquarters in Omaha, Neb.
   The crew was practicing landings after a seven-hour training
flight when it crashed during one of its touch-and-go approaches,
Peck said. During such maneuvers, landing gears touch the ground but
the plane doesn't land.
   All three sections of the plane burned on impact, said Senior
Airman Tim Sanders, a base spokesman. The crew members crawled or
were helped out of the front section of the aircraft, he said. They
were taken to Marquette General and base hospitals.
   Members of the crew suffered broken bones, but no one was burned,
said Capt. Paul Bicking, another Sawyer spokesman.
   Senior Airman Tim Sanders, another base spokesman, said those
aboard were Capt. Mark Hartney, 29, an aircraft commander from
Mulberry, Fla.; 1st Lt. Michael S. Debruzzi, 26, a pilot from New
Brighton, Minn.; Capt. Anthony D. Phillips, 28, a radar navigator
from Folkston, Ga.; 1st Lt. James W. Herrmann, 30, a navigator from
Sharpsville, Pa.; 1st Lt. Daniel McCarrick, 25, an electronic
warfare officer from Succasunna, N.J.; Airman 1st Class, Joseph A.
Vallie, 20, a gunner from Stephenson, Mich.; Maj. William R.
Kroeger, 52, an instructor pilot from Fountain Hills, Ariz.; and 1st
Lt. Gregory C. Smith, 26, an upgrade pilot from Henning, Minn. All
were based at Sawyer.
   Ann Parent, a spokeswoman for Marquette General Hospital, said
Hartney and Debruzzi were in fair condition, Phillips and Vallie
were in stable condition, McCarrick was in satisfactory condition
and Kroeger was in serious condition.
   Herrmann and Smith were listed in stable condition at the base
hospital, said Technical Sgt. Anita Bailey.
   Hartney was the aircraft commander, but Debruzzi also was
qualified to fly the plane, Bailey said. She did not know who was at
the controls at the time of the crash.
   ``We are counting our blessings,'' Bailey said. ``You can put
parts of a plane back together, but you cannot put people back
together.''
   The accident was classified as the most serious kind, and all
aircraft exercises at Sawyer were canceled even though runways other
than the one where the crash occurred remained open, Bailey said.
   Peck said a board of officers will investigate the accident,
adding weather did not appear to be a factor in the crash.
   Peck said it was not unusual for B-52 training missions to be out
at that hour.
   ``Crews have to be trained to fly at any time of the day or night
in any weather,'' he said.
   The eight-engine B-52, which was deployed in the early 1950s, is
the military's biggest bomber, with a wingspan of 185 feet and a
maximum takeoff weight of 488,000 pounds. The last B-52 was
commissioned in 1962.
   In other accidents involving B-52s, a bomber was damaged when a
pilot aborted a takeoff and overshot a runway at Castle Air Force
Base in central California on Feb. 11. No one was injured.
   A B-52 bomber with radar problems crashed in Arizona'a Monument
Valley in October 1984, killing two crew members, after its wings
clipped a mesa.
   The Air Force has had more trouble recently with the B-52's
successor, the B-1B bomber. Although smaller than the B-52, the B-1B
can fly at supersonic speeds and carry more bombs.
   Four B-1Bs have crashed in the four years the plane has been
flying, including two nine days apart in November. One of the $280
million B-1Bs was destroyed after smashing onto a runway at
Ellsworth Air Force Base, S.D., during a training flight on Nov. 17.
On Nov. 8, a B-1B crashed and burned in a field near Dyess Air Force
Base, Texas.
   No one was killed in either crash and investigators have not
disclosed what caused the accidents.
   Six crewmen died and 10 were injured Oct. 11 when an Air Force
tanker en route from K.I. Sawyer crashed at Wurtsmith Air Force Base
near Oscoda. The Air Force's investigation of the crash is
incomplete. Wurtsmith and Sawyer are Michigan's two SAC bases.

   Actor Gary Busey was responding to simple
commands and showed no signs of brain damage following surgery for
head injuries he suffered when he was thrown from his motorcycle and
smacked headfirst, without a helmet, into a curb.
   Busey, 44, a longtime opponent of laws requiring motorcyclists to
wear helmets, underwent neurosurgery to remove blood clots from his
brain after Sunday's crash in Culver City. His condition, listed as
critical following the operation, was upgraded to serious but
stable, Ron Wise, spokesman for Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, said
today.
   ``He continues to show progress. He will react appropriately to a
question or a statement,'' Wise said, adding that those signs
indicate a lack of brain damage. ``He's not 100 percent; he's still
groggy,'' the spokesman said.
   Busey, who was nominated for an Academy Award for his starring
role in the 1978 movie ``The Buddy Holly Story,'' was visited by his
wife, Judy, and 17-year-old son, Jake.
   The actor was talking, moving his arms and legs and had no
trouble recognizing his wife and family, though ``of course, he's
groggy,'' Wise said.
   The spokesman, who predicted Busey would be in the hospital a
couple of weeks, said the switchboard was inundated with telephone
calls from hundreds of fans and friends. Among the celebrity callers
was Kris Kristofferson.
   The actor was one of a group of celebrity motorcycle enthusiasts
who have campaigned against manadatory helmet laws.
   Backers of state legislation that would require helmets for all
motorcyclists said Monday the crash, though tragic, could counter
some damage done by Busey an some other actors to the cause of
mandatory safety measures.
   ``It saddens me for anybody to be injured or killed, (but) this
is a very sad opportunity to again say, `Why not helmets?''' said
Dr. Elizabeth McLoughlin of the Trauma Foundation at San Francisco
General Hospital.
   A helmet law passed by the state Assembly but vetoed by the
governor last session was re-introduced by Assemblyman Richard Floyd
on Monday, the first day of the new legislative term.
   Police said the one-vehicle accident in suburban Culver City
appeared to be Busey's fault. He picked up the bike from a repair
shop Sunday morning, accelerated up a street and lost control making
a turn about half a block away.
   Big-street bikes are all the rage with male celebrities these
days.
   Busey's manager, Herb Nanas, said Busey rolled out his 1300-cc
Harley Heritage Softail for regular Sunday rides in the California
countryside with a loose-knit group that includes actors Lorenzo
Lamas and Ray Sharkey and assorted professional men.
   ``We're not hot-rodders; none of us are,'' Nanas said. He
explained the attraction of trundling a big bike along a rural
highway, helmetless, at legal speed: ``It's out of the mainstream of
the energy of the city. It's the wind in your hair. It's freedom.''
   Other actors sighted astride the big-bore ``hog'' motorcycles,
which sell for up to $25,000, include Sylvester Stallone, Arnold
Schwarzenegger, and Fred Dryer, the former pro football player who
appears on the ``Hunter'' TV series.
   Busey's film credits include ``Lethal Weapon,'' ``A Star Is
Born,'' ``Carny,'' ``Big Wednesday'' and ``The Bear.'' He recently
completed a movie ``Hider in the House,'' with Mimi Rogers.

<TEXT>
   Soviet media Tuesday gave prominence to Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's scheduled address to the U.N. General Assembly, rather
than his planned meetings with President Reagan and President-elect
George Bush.
   The official Tass news agency's stories on the 57-year-old
president's departure for New York said only that he would speak to
the world body on Wednesday, and did not mention his sessions the
same day with the U.S. leaders.
   Other Tass stories reported Bush's remarks Monday that he was
eager to move relations with the Soviet Union forward, and comments
by Americans about Gorbachev's trip.
   While Tass issued a separate story praising the decision of U.S.
television networks to cover Gorbachev's arrival in New York live,
state-run Soviet TV didn't show his departure from Moscow until
three hours later.
   In a traditional sendoff, members of the ruling Politburo stood
and waved on the tarmac of Moscow's Vnukovo 2 airport as Gorbachev
and his wife, Raisa, walked to their plane at midday Tuesday. The
sky was overcast and wet snow made the ground slushy, and all the
officials wore fur hats.
   The Soviet media did not report Gorbachev's itinerary, and gave
only a general idea of what he would discuss in New York. Tass said
he would speak with Reagan and Bush about ``arms limitation and
reduction, human rights, a settlement of regional conflicts, and the
development bilateral relations.''
   As for the U.N. speech and meetings with Reagan and Bush, the
clearest hint for Soviets of what their leader might propose was a
reference in the Red Army's newspaper, Krasnaya Zvyezda, on Tuesday
to the possibility the Soviet Union will reduce the size of its
armed forces. The article mentioned Gorbachev's speech and his
meetings with Reagan and Bush, but it did not make clear whether
Gorbachev would announce an armed forces reduction, or provide
details of the step.
   Radio Moscow gave only this tantalizing preview in an
international broadcast: ``It's presumed that during his stay in New
York, Mikhail Gorbachev will advance new initiatives.''
   The evening newspaper Izvestia said in a front-page story Tuesday
that the big question in New York was what proposals or offers
Gorbachev would make.
   ``The answer is given in various forms, but with one thought:
wait just a little longer: on Dec. 7, all will become known,'' the
newspaper said.
   In a dispatch by a diplomatic correspondent distributed after
Gorbchev's departure, Tass said the Soviet leader intends to discuss
the entire range of U.S.-Soviet issues with Reagan and Bush.
   ``The Soviet leadership intends to talk about important
substantive matters concerning real political cooperation between
the two countries on the broadest range of problems, including the
state of affairs and prospects for further headway in the fields of
arms limitation and reduction, human rights, a settlement of
regional conflicts, and the development of bilateral relations,''
the dispatch said.
   Gorbachev's decision to address the United Nations was a sign of
Soviet regard for the world body as an ``indispensable mechanism in
the quest for a peaceful solution to international issues, for
resolution of crisis situations, and for settlement of other global
problems,'' Tass said.
   In several reports Monday, the media emphasized the new style of
Soviet diplomacy and the need for speedy progress on arms control
issues when Bush takes office in January.
   Bush has said he will meet with Gorbachev in his capacity as vice
president, not as president-elect, so as not to overshadow Reagan
before he leaves office next month. But virtually all Soviet reports
about the session referred to Bush only as president-elect, and they
stressed the importance of the meeting in continuing improvements in
relations in the Bush administration.
   Gorbachev was accompanied by Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev and Deputy
Premier Vladimir Kamentsev.

<HEAD>An Old Washington Hand's Advice to the Newcomers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Don't play president _ you're not,'' old
Washington hand Donald H. Rumsfeld advises those who will serve at
the side of George Bush. ``The Constitution provides for only one
president.''
   `Assume that most everything you say or do will be on the front
page of The Washington Post the next morning,'' he tells those who
will move into the White House in January.
   ``Learn quickly how to say, `I don't know,''' he adds. ``If you
foul up, tell the president and others fast, and correct it.''
   And this calming piece viewpoint: ``From the inside, the White
House more than occasionally looks as untidy as the inside of a
stomach. Don't let the perspective you have, which is unique, or the
buffeting you receive panic you. It probably looks better and is
likely going smoother than it may seem from where you sit.''
   While holding a half-dozen jobs over two decades in three
Republican administrations, Rumsfeld jotted down his observations on
how to work for and around presidents without getting
presidential-sized egos.
   When he joined former Presidents Carter and Ford, scholars and
other former government officials in writing ``American Agenda,'' a
compendium of policy advice for President-elect Bush, Rumsfeld
pulled out his bits of Washington wisdom. They make the final
chapter of the blue-covered briefing book.
   Many of ``Rumsfeld's rules'' deal with keeping the ego in check
and reflect lessons learned through service directing Richard
Nixon's Office of Economic Opportunity and the wage-price control
program and as Nixon's ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization; as Ford's chief of staff and secretary of defense; and
as President Reagan's Middle East envoy.
   Samples:
   _``Don't speak ill of your predecessors (or successor) _ you did
not walk in their shoes.''
   _``Don't begin to believe you are indispensable or infallible,
and don't let the president, or others, think you are _ you're not.''
   _``Don't speak ill of other members of the administration.''
   _``Never say `the White House wants' _ buildings don't `want.'''
   _``One price of proximity to the president is the duty to bring
bad news. You fail him, and yourself, if you are unwilling to do
so.''
   _``Don't forget that the 50 or so invitations you receive a week
are sent not because those people are just dying to see you, but
because of the position you hold. If you don't believe me, ask one
of your predecessors how fast they stop.''
   _``Don't take the job, or stay in it, unless you have an
understanding with the president that you are free to tell him what
you think, on any subject, `with the bark off' _ and the freedom in
practice to do it.''
   _``Work continuously to reduce the number of people who have
White House phones, White House stationery, White House Mess
privileges, and the like. Only those who see the president
frequently, say three or four times a week, should be in a position
to represent themselves as being `White House staff.'''
   _``Simply because a problem is shown to exist, it doesn't
necessarily follow that there is a solution.''

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials plan a memorial service
Thursday for the commander of U.S. Air Force personnel in the
Mediterranean who was killed when his F-16 fighter crashed on a
training flight.
   Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Harpe was flying in formation with three
jets Monday when his single-seat plane crashed near the end of a
routine 90-minute flight about 18 miles northeast of Torrejon air
base near Madrid, said Maj. Keith Gillet, an Air Force spokesman.
   The 50-year-old veteran fighter pilot was required to fly 30
similar sorties every six months, said another spokesman, Sgt.
Charlton Ritchie.
   Since 1987, Harpe was commander of U.S. air force units in Spain,
Italy, Greece and Turkey. Maj. Gen. William Grove, stationed in
Ankara, Turkey, arrived Tuesday in Torrejon to assume Harpe's
command, Gillet said.
   Arrangements were being made at the Spanish-American base for an
outdoor memorial service on Thursday, with burial in Arlington
National Cemetery on an unspecified date, Gillet said.
   An investigation was launched into the cause of the crash.
   The jet flown by Harpe formed part of the 401st Tactical Fighter
Wing of 72 F-16s at Torrejon, which under a new eight-year defense
agreement signed recently by Spain and the United States must be
withdrawn by 1992.
   Italy is to provide a new home for the 401st wing in Crotone,
Italy.
   Harpe commanded the U.S. 16th Air Force of about 15,000 U.S.
troops at 10 American bases in Spain, Italy, Greece and Turkey.
   Harpe's flying career began in KC-135 refueling aircraft at Beale
Air Force Base, Calif.
   In 1966-67, he was assigned to the U.S. Air Force 388th Tactical
Fighter Wing at Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base in Thailand and flew
100 combat missions over North Vietnam.
   He was promoted to major general in 1984 and named Air Force
assistant deputy chief of staff for personnel in 1986. He received
the Mediterranean command the following year.
   Harpe is survived by his wife, Ramelle, of Orlando, Fla., a son,
Randall, and a daughter, Andrea.
   In Cedertown, Ga., his mother, Edith Harpe, said he had ``a full,
happy charmed life.''
   ``He was doing what he wanted to do and he was very happy. He
loved his country and the military,'' she said. ``We've always been
proud of him.''

   William E. ``Joe'' Potter, a retired Army
major general and former Panama Canal governor who helped build Walt
Disney World, has died of heart failure at the age of 83.
   He spent 38 years with the Army Corps of Engineers and was
governor of the Panama Canal Zone from 1956 until he retired from
the Army in 1960. He directed logistical planning for the World War
II invasion of Europe and later headed the Army's ``Red Ball
Express'' transportation operation on the continent.
   He was known as ``Mr. Disney'' for his liaison work between the
park and the community in the 1960s and 1970s.
   ``He was a man Walt Disney was very fond of,'' said Dick Nunis,
president of Walt Disney Attractions. ``Without a Joe Potter there
would be no Walt Disney World today.''
   The late Walt Disney met and hired Potter at the 1964 New York
World's Fair, which Potter was instrumental in building.
   Potter directed construction of the infrastructure for Disney
World, including underground sewer, power and water treatment plants
that were considered revolutionary at the time.
   ``I went out and got three crackerjack college professors to show
me how to do it,'' he told an interviewer last year. And then I got
me another professor to help put the utilities underground.''
   Potter, who died Monday, is survived by his wife, two daughters
and six grandchildren. Funeral arrangements were not announced.

   From a distance, Diana Paine saw emergency
vehicles respond to an accident that killed an 11-year-old boy,
struck by a truck while riding his dirt bike to school.
   Later, she learned it was her son _ the third of her four
children to die in the past nine years.
   ``No one should have to go through three of them. One is bad
enough,'' said Mrs. Paine, 32.
   Shawn McGuire was killed Monday when he cut across traffic on a
busy six-lane artery and was struck by a pickup truck, police said.
   ``I don't miss them until the casket is closed,'' Mrs. Paine
said. ``When they're lowered into the grave, that's the last you can
see of them. I think it's unfair. It really is.''
   Mrs. Paine said crib death claimed her 7{-week-old daughter,
Laura Jean Paine, in July. She lost her 6-year-old son, Ralph
Raymond Kegg, to pneumonia in 1979.
   Mrs. Paine and her husband, William James Paine Jr., 26, have a
2-year-old son, Anthony.
   Mrs. Paine said Shawn usually rode the school bus, but decided
Monday to ride the dirt bike he got for his birthday in September.
She thought he knew enough to get to an intersection or a traffic
light before trying to cross the heavily traveled road.
   No charges were filed against the truck driver but an
investigation continues, said Largo police Sgt. Ned Karantonis.
   The Paines, meanwhile, are trying to cope with their grief.
   Each time one of her children is buried, Mrs. Paine stacks all
his belongings in a pile and burns them.
   ``I don't believe a living child should have to play with a dead
child's toys,'' she said.

   Federal grand juries are delving into
allegations that some doctors are organizing to block new health
delivery systems, agreeing on minimum prices and allocating patients
among themselves, a Justice Department official said Tuesday.
   ``We are prepared to indict and fully to prosecute the
professionals involved if the evidence warrants it,'' Assistant
Attorney General Charles Rule told a meeting of an American Medical
Association group in Dallas.
   Rule, chief of the Justice Department's antitrust division, said
there are ``a few in the profession who it appears may have chosen
to hold themselves above the law.''
   He added that ``naked agreements'' to fix prices, allocate
territories or to boycott competing health-care providers are
violations that can be prosecuted with penalties of up to three
years in prison and $250,000 fines for each violation. Copies of his
speech were released at the Justice Department in Washington.
   Rule declined to give any specifics about the grand jury probes,
but a Justice Department spokesman, Mark Sheehan, said three grand
juries are empaneled, investigating possible price-fixing by some
allergists in Boston, some dentists in Tucson, Ariz., and some
obstetricians in Savannah, Ga.
   It is rare for the government to prosecute organizations of
medical professionals for criminal violations of the antitrust laws.
   The AMA was successfully prosecuted in the 1940s for attempting
to eliminate an employee-sponsored organization that sought to
compete with fee-for-service doctors, Rule noted.
   Rule declined to provide any details about the grand jury probes,
but in his speech text he said ``we have heard about doctors
organizing to block new delivery systems ... by agreeing to withhold
their services or to boycott doctors who do agree to provide their
services.''
   He said this kind of behavior ``is not unlike that prosecuted
nearly 50 years ago in the AMA case.''
   Rule also said there have been allegations that groups of
independent doctors meet secretly to agree to a minimum price or to
other terms that they will insist upon when they discuss
participating in a group.
   Other allegations, he said, concern doctors agreeing to allocate
patients among themselves on the basis of the patient's residence or
some other criteria.

<TEXT>
   A two-hour disturbance involving 150 to 200
inmates of the Essex County jail erupted just after a television
news show was broadcast depicting overcrowding at the jail.
   Sheriff Charles Reardon told reporters ``there was a lot of
destruction'' inside the jail. He said inmates had set small fires,
pulled pipes off walls and knocked off railings. He said there was a
lot of water damage.
   Reardon said overcrowding probably was a factor in the
disturbance. One inmate and one guard suffered minor injuries,
authorities said.
   A man who identified himself as inmate Michael Robitaille
telephoned the Union-News newspaper in Springfield from the jail and
said the violence began shortly after 8 p.m., after a segment on
WCVB-TV's ``Chronicle'' series focused on conditions at the jail.
   ``Chronicle'' producer Mark Mills said the program focused on
overcrowding at the Salem jail as well as other elements of the

   A teen-ager has been charged with killing
his parents, both found shot in the head, because his mother accused
him of using illegal drugs, authorities report.
   The bodies of Dr. Donovan Donly, 54, and his wife, Suzanne, 49,
were found Sunday in the kitchen of their home outside Reading.
   Rory Donly was charged with murder, criminal homicide and
voluntary manslaughter. Berks County Assistant District Attorney
Mark Baldwin said he would ask to have bail set at $1 million. A
preliminary hearing will be Dec. 14.
   Rory, who will be 17 next week, will be tried as an adult,
Baldwin said.
   The shootings occurred Saturday afternoon and young Donly was
believed to have used a .22-caliber rifle which was found leaning
against a tree outside the home, Baldwin said.
   While being questioned, the Schuylkill Valley High School junior
admitted shooting his parents, according to court documents filed
Sunday during a preliminary arraignment.
   ``He said he was having an argument with his mother over whether
he was using narcotics or not,'' Baldwin said.
   Donly operated a general medical practice and was on the staff at
Reading Community General Hospital.
   Investigators said Donly was at the hospital Saturday when he
received an urgent call in the afternoon to go home. District
Attorney George C. Yatron said investigators believe Mrs. Donly was
shot first, while preparing dinner, and Donly was shot a short time
later when he returned home.
   Police were called Sunday by Dr. Eugene Shippen, once associated
with Donly, who went to the home at the request of Donly's answering
service.
   The Donlys had four other children, who all live elsewhere.

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One thing had been bothering Soviet
interpreter Inna Novikova since the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Emerging Leaders
Summit began last week.
   She had seen people sleeping on steam grates and living in
cardboard boxes and wanted to know how a country with a reputation
for wealth could allow its poor to live that way.
   ``I think people (Soviet delegates) will have a view of America
that it is just perfect and only rich people live here,'' Ms.
Novikova said as she stopped at the Dignity Shelter. ``The hosting
party is only showing us things in the best possible light.
   ``I want to see the other side of America, not just the best part
of America. I want to see how ordinary people live. Not everything
is perfect in this country.''
   Ms. Novikova and the 169 other Soviet delegates have been staying
in a leading hotel and received VIP treatment at the Army-Navy
football game Saturday and from the Cigna Corp. on Sunday, when the
group visited the Philadelphia insurance company's posh suburban
conference center.
   When Monday's session broke early, Ms. Novikova persuaded U.S.
delegate Arthur Schwartz, who operates the Philadelphia Youth
Leadership Institute, to take her to homeless shelters.
   At Women of Hope, a shelter for chronic mentally ill women and
operated by Sisters of Mercy, Ms. Novikova asked a woman what being
homeless meant.
   ``I just left home because I got tired of the aggravation,'' said
Deneen Ferbee, 30, who works as a mental health aide but who has
been homeless for seven months. ``I stayed in hotels and friends'
houses'' until money ran out.
   As for the other women residents, Ms. Ferbee said, ``The streets
become their homes.''
   For Ms. Novikova, it was difficult to grasp why someone would
choose to live on the street.
   ``I cannot digest this,'' said Ms. Novikova, 30, who lives with
her parents because Moscow apartments are at a premium.
   When someone is living on the street, Ms. Ferbee said, ``You
don't know who to go to, where to go. If you go to a shelter, you
might not feel comfortable there. All shelters are not clean. ...
The food is bad. They don't want to live there. There may be rats
and roaches running around. They say, `Why live here when we can
live on the streets?'
   ``Do you understand?''
   ``Maybe a little better,'' replied Ms. Novikova, who peeked into
bedroms, closets and bathrooms of the neatly kept shelter.
   ``There's not as much wealth (in the Soviet Union), but we don't
have the tremendous poverty either,'' she said.
   Staff member Kathy Murray said some homeless people, including
substance abusers and the mentally ill, will not leave the streets.
Ms. Novikova saw what Ms. Murray was talking about at a subway exit,
where about 40 people were living in rows of cardboard boxes.
   ``I'm starving, hungry, down here with nothing to eat,'' said
Michael Jordan, 30, who said he has been homeless for four years.
   ``How did it happen?'' Ms. Novikova asked.
   ``I'm very upset and hungry and haven't eaten in three, four
days,'' Jordan said. ``You have any money?''
   Thomas Wiggins, 30 and homeless, interjected that ``you'd be
surprised how many Viet vets live down here. The government is
obviously not doing their job.''
   Ms. Novikova asked him why he didn't go to a shelter.
   ``Living in a shelter is like living in a penitentiary,'' Wiggins
replied.
   Jordan remarked to Ms. Novikova, ``If you go back to Russia, I'll
go with you. It's got to be better than here.''
   Replied Wiggins, ``No, man, this is the best country in the
world.''

<HEAD>Tainted Water At Refuge Suspected In Bald Eagle's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bald eagle that died two days after it was
discovered ill in the Stillwater National Wildlife Area probably was
poisoned by the increasingly toxic waters at the wetlands,
biologists said.
   The bird's carcass was shipped Tuesday to the National Wildlife
Health Laboratory in Wisconsin so scientists could confirm the cause
of death.
   If the 1{-year-old eagle did die Monday from toxic poisoning, it
would be the first confirmed case at Stillwater of a bald eagle
dying from such a cause, said biologist Steve Thompson.
   About 18,000 birds and 10 million fish have died at the
164,000-acre wildlife refuge 90 miles east of Reno during the past
three years as drought evaporated the waters, allowing toxins to
build up and disease to spread.
   Thompson said scientists suspect the 9-pound bald eagle died of
toxins because of the bird's behavior, including wheezing, and its
low weight.
   ``These could be signs of trace-element toxicity or avian
disease,'' Thompson said. ``Right now, we strongly suspect either
lead or mercury poisoning.''
   Preliminary data from a study of the Newlands Project, a farming
area that drains into Stillwater, shows high levels of selenium,
boron, arsenic and mercury entering the wildlife refuge through
irrigation ditches.
   During the past two years, the wetlands, which serve as a
stopover for migrating ducks, geese and shorebirds on the Pacific
Flyway, have shrunk from 14,000 acres to less than 4,000 acres.

<HEAD>Peres Seeks Talks With Likud, Shamir Faces More Problems</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Israel, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres responded Tuesday
to a plea from the president and again urged his Labor Party to
renew coalition talks with the rival Likud bloc.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, meanwhile, ran into more
difficulties in his efforts to build a coalition led by his
right-wing Likud. Leaders of two religious parties claimed Shamir
had promised both the same Cabinet post, and the two rabbis held a
shouting match on state-run Israel radio.
   Peres' new stand emerged after a breakfast meeting with Israeli
President Chaim Herzog, a veteran Laborite who pleaded Monday for a
Likud-Labor national unity government as he granted Shamir a 21-day
extension to form a government.
   Herzog told Peres such a government was the wish of the majority
of Israelis.
   ``I was very impressed by what the president had to say,'' Peres
said. ``I told him I will propose to convene the (party's) Central
Committee this week. I will recommend to the committee to meet the
request of the president.''
   Labor's 110-member executive bureau, the party's governing body,
last week voted in defiance of Peres and Labor's No. 2, Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and vetoed coalition talks with Likud.
   The 1,300-member central committee is empowered to overrule the
bureau's decision, and Labor Secretary-General Uzi Baram said the
committee would meet Thursday.
   ``Even though I feel we should not join a Likud government under
any circumstances ... if there's a demand to convene the commitee we
will do so immediately,'' said Baram, who led younger Labor members
in the vote against Peres and Rabin last week.
   The issue of negotiations with Likud has deeply divided the party
and renewed a long-standing rivalry between Peres and Rabin.
   Shamir, who has said he prefers a broad-based, Likud-led Cabinet,
also is working on composing a narrow government with far-right
parties and the four ultra-Orthodox parties that hold a decisive 18
seats in the 120-member parliament.
   In the Nov. 1 elections, Likud won 40 seats to Labor's 39, with
the remaining seats divided between 13 small factions.
   Shamir's efforts to weld together the religious parties ran into
trouble Tuesday as Rabbi Menachem Porush of Agudat Israel and Rabbi
Avraham Ravitz of the Torah Flag said Likud promised both control
over the Education Ministry's ultra-Orthodox department.
   A debate between the rabbis on Israel radio quickly deteriorated
into a shouting match, with each interrupting the other.
   Despite the difficulties, Shamir was quoted as saying that Likud
would not seek new talks with Labor until Labor reversed its ban on
contacts with Likud.
   ``There will be no chances for a broad-based government as long
as the Labor Party doesn't change its decision of last week,''
Shamir told the Maariv newspaper.
   Peres, in turn, criticized Shamir for making too many concessions
to potential coalition partners, especially the Orthodox parties
that are pushing for far-reaching religious legislation.
   A broad-based government, Peres said, must ``prevent legislation
that will divide the Jewish people.''
   He was referring to the so-called ``Who is a Jew'' law demanded
by the religious parties. Such legislation would give Orthodox
rabbis sole authority over conversions to Judaism.
   The proposal has sparked anger among U.S. Jews, most of whom
belong to the more liberal Reform and Conservative branches of
Judaism and feel such that such legislation would delegitimize their
beliefs.
   Dozens of American Jewish leaders have come to Israel in recent
days to campaign against the proposed law.
   In a meeting Tuesday with representatives of the U.S. Council of
Jewish Federations, Peres said the Labor would not vote for the
``Who Is a Jew'' law even if it joins a government.
   ``The Labor Party would not change its position. It will vote
against the law as one man,'' he said in remarks broadcast on Israel
army radio.

<HEAD>Auto-Fume Control Rule Unlikely Before New Administration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A regulation to require anti-fume devices on
gas tanks of new vehicles is unlikely to be issued before the Bush
administration takes office, the Environmental Protection Agency
said Tuesday.
   ``Our legal requirements are we have a public hearing, give two
weeks notice minimum, and the record be open for 30 days after the
hearing,'' said Dick Wilson, director of the EPA's office of mobile
sources. ``I think it is pretty hard to squeeze that in in the time
remaining.''
   The schedule outlined by Wilson conflicted with EPA Administrator
Lee Thomas' intent to complete the regulation in the waning days of
the Reagan administration.
   Thomas was ``determined to finish up this issue before he leaves
office'' on Jan. 20, the last day of President Reagan's term, Martha
Casey, an EPA spokeswoman, said Tuesday.
   The plan, which the agency has been working on since 1987, has
drawn criticism from auto manufacturers, who argued the fume traps
would increase the chance of fire in crashes.
   The EPA proposed the regulation after studies showed that
gasoline fumes escaping while gas tanks were being filled could be
dangerous to health.
   The proposed regulation, part of a broader package of
fuel-volatility regulations, is now under review by the White House
Office of Management and Budget.
   Once OMB has completed its work, the proposal will be returned to
EPA, which will solicit public comment on the safety issue, Wilson
said.
   After the end of the 30-day comment period, the agency must study
the record before deciding what form the regulation will take,
Wilson said.
   The agency's study is typically completed in ``a matter of
weeks,'' Wilson said.
   Even if the proposal were returned to EPA on Wednesday and the
post-comment study were completed in a week, the regulation could be
issued at the earliest in the first week of president-elect George
Bush's administration under the schedule outlined by Wilson.
   ``I don't want to buy into the theory that we're in a race
against the clock,'' Wilson said. ``We aren't trying to cram a
regulation out without taking all the due process ... to be sure
what we're doing makes sense.''
   Oil companies have contended the fume traps should be installed
in vehicles, while automakers say they should be placed on gas pumps
at service stations.
   The automobile-mounted trap includes a rubber tube that directs
fumes into a charcoal-filled canister, from which they eventually
move into the engine for burning.
   Automakers have said the fume trap would add $80 to a cost of
each vehicle. The EPA estimates the added cost at $20 per vehicle.

   Musicians have voted to accept a new
contract with the Hartford Symphony Orchestra, ending an 11-week
strike over wages and working conditions that forced the
cancellation of 36 performances.
   The new contract was approved late Monday by a vote of 51-22.
   ``I think we've made major strides in several of the areas that
were important to us,'' said Sarah Oyer, a violinist and member of
the negotiating team for Local 400 of the American Federation of
Musicians.
   ``But there were still some disappointments, particularly in
salaries for the core players, who were hoping for a living wage.
That hasn't happened. So there is not a sense of having won. When
the results of the vote were announced there was silence.''
   Top salary under the new contract, tentatively accepted by
negotiators last week, will increase from $17,894 to $20,500 by 1991.
   ``I'm certainly pleased that the strike has been settled, and the
sounds of silence can be replaced by the sounds of the Hartford
Symphony Orchestra,'' said Morton Handel, president of the orchestra.
   Michael Lankester, the orchestra's music director, was
particularly pleased.
   ``The last note I conducted in the Bushnell (the orchestra's
home) was the final, dramatic chord of Prokofiev's ``Ivan the
Terrible,''' Lankester said. ``It thrills me to think that we can
pick up where we left off and now perform the glorious music we have
planned for the rest of the season.''
   It was the orchestra's first strike since 1982, when the
musicians staged a one-day walkout.
   The musicians had agreed during the strike that they would
perform for the Hartford Ballet's annual performance of
``Nutcracker,'' scheduled to begin a 10-day run on Dec. 15.

   The success of a movie about three
girlfriends who work in a small-town pizza parlor has turned the
real Mystic Pizza into one of this tourist town's top attractions.
   Mystic Pizza owners Steve and Fofi Zelepos say they have lines
outside their parlor and are even entertaining a franchising
proposal put forward by a group of New York businessmen in the wake
of the opening of the popular movie, ``Mystic Pizza.''
   ``But it means more work,'' Fofi Zelepos said. ``I used to go
home after 2 in the afternoon. Now sometimes I'm here until 11 at
night.''
   Zelepos, 51, said people are coming from New York and New Jersey
to the restaurant his family has run for 14 years in the Connecticut
shoreline town.
   ``Some of them call and say they want to make reservations. What
reservations? This is a pizza place. We don't take reservations. I
say to them to come and take their chances on getting in.''
   The Zelepos family does plan to expand, opening a branch _ Mystic
Pizza the Second _ in nearby North Stonington. It will be operated
by the couple's 23-year-old son, John.
   The motion picture that has altered the lives of the Zelepos
family was the brainchild of Amy Jones, a director and screenwriter
who dropped into the pizza parlor during a vacation in Mystic.

   Looking for that unusual stocking stuffer?
How about a time-bomb alarm clock for just $14.95? Or a knife
concealed in a lipstick container.
   Yes, it's Christmas time at the U.S. Cavalry store in Radcliff,
where a Nativity scene in the window shares time with examples of
one of the world's largest varieties of military products available
in one place.
   Company President Randy Acton said the selection has attracted
customers as varied as singer Michael Jackson, who ordered the knife
concealed in a lipstick container, and Panamanian Gen. Manuel
Noriega, who has called on the company for his personal uniforms and
underwear.
   Acton said the company had sales topping $10 million last year.
   Camouflage is, indeed, the design of choice at U.S. Cavalry. It's
on computer covers, duct tape toilet paper, pen-and-pencil sets and
of course, canteens, cots, goggles, gloves, hats, holsters, jackets,
tarpaulins and sleeping bags.
   The company also offers a full line of camouflage clothing for
toddlers.
   The business started in 1973 when Acton, a Vietnam veteran with a
marketing degree from Oklahoma State University, began selling
permanent-press fatigue uniforms out of a Volkswagen van.
   U.S. Cavalry, now with a staff of about 150 people, has a
recently renovated 50,000-square-foot headquarters, warehouse and

   Their initial reaction is ``yech,'' but by
the time the annual Rat Olympics roll around psychology students at
Nebraska Wesleyan University view their rodents with new respect and
affection.
   The Rat Olympics to be held Saturday were established in 1975 to
help psychology students get more out of their laboratory work in
the department's learning and motivation class, according to Kenneth
Keith, associate professor of psychology.
   Students train the white rats in six events _ the five-yard dash,
four-foot tightrope walk, five-yard hurdles, five-foot rope climb,
weightlifting and long jump.
   Diana Stratbucker, 20, a psychology major, was a little leery of
training a rat when the topic first emerged in class, but now she
thinks her rodent named ``Gumby'' can break the Olympic record of
four feet in the long jump.
   ``That's about the only event we have any hope in. Mine was
jumping four feet today so hopefully we'll beat the record,'' she
said.
   Keith said the typical reaction from some students on the first
day is, ``Yech.''
   ``A lot of them feel at first they couldn't possibly handle a
rat. But then, when they get to work with them, they find out they
are mostly like kittens or puppies and they get kind of attached.
Most of them end up keeping their rats as pets.''

<HEAD>Shevardnadze's Visit to Japan to Focus On Trade, Disputed Islands</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's visit
to Japan will bolster the nearly $5 billion bilateral trade and help
resolve the dispute over islands claimed by both nations, the Soviet
ambassador said Tuesday.
   Shevardnadze, the first high-level Soviet official to visit Japan
in nearly a decade, is due in Tokyo Dec. 19-21 for meetings with
Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno and Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.
   Ambassador Nikolai N. Soloviev said improved ties between the two
countries were important to stability in the Pacific region and that
the diplomatic visit would be ``very important ... because
Japan-Soviet relations are at an important stage.''
   He said bilateral trade has grown to $4.98 billion in 1988, up
from $4.9 billion last year, and the potential for bilateral
economic cooperation was great.
   The talks were expected to touch on Japanese investment in
western Siberia. In November, the Soviet Union signed a preliminary
agreement with Mitsubishi Corp. and other Japanese companies to
build a $8.3 billion chemical complex there.
   Soloviev said the two countries have concluded six joint
ventures, and 40 others were under negotiation.
   A major obstacle to improved Soviet-Japanese ties is a
territorial dispute over the tiny Kuril islands off the northern
Japanese coast, which are claimed by Japan but have been occupied by
the Soviet Union since 1945. Soviet troops invaded the islands at
the end of World War II and later fortified them with 10,000 troops.
   Soloviev told a private group in Tokyo that both nations must
respect each other's claims to the islands.
   ``In history, (Soviet-Japanese) relations have been very
complicated ... but we must now direct our line of vision to the
future,'' he said.
   Japanese diplomats have said they expect no substantial
improvement in bilateral ties until Moscow agrees to negotiate the
return of the islands.
   After Tokyo, Shevardnadze will visit the Philippines and North
Korea, the Kyodo News Service said.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan told Panama's deposed
president, Eric Arturo Delvalle, by telephone Tuesday that the
United States still supports a return to democracy in the Central
American republic, the chief White House spokesman said.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan talked for about 10
minutes with Delvalle, who was in Miami visiting Panamanian exiles
there.
   He said Reagan told Delvalle that the U.S. policy in favor of
freedom in Panama ``remains steady.''
   ``We will continue to work with you and the Panamanian people in
favor of a realistic and durable solution,'' Fitzwater quoted Reagan
as saying.
   He said the president told Delvalle that ``we were very pleased
to see the unity that you and your colleagues put together last
month'' _ a reference to a meeting of Panamanian opposition leaders,
who restated their desire for the ouster of military leader Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Fitzwater said the United States still believes that Noriega
``shouessential to the restoration
of democracy'' in Panama.
   Asked why Reagan chose to call Delvalle at this particular time,
the spokesman said it was because the ousted Panamanian president
was easily accessible in Miami. Delvalle had gone into hiding after
he was deposed last Feb. 26 and replaced by Manuel Solis Palma.
   The United States has sought to undermine Noriega's hold on power
with an array of economic sanctions and with diplomatic pressure.
But there has been no indication that Noriega, who is charged with
drug trafficking in federal indictments in Florida, has lost his
grip on power.

   Two Florida pilots were among the first to
be convicted in a federal crackdown on pilots who have failed to
report drunken driving and drug convictions on their license
applications.
   Thirty-nine pilots have been indicted in Florida, Colorado and
Utah, and a probe of 7,850 others is under way, according to the
Federal Aviation Administration.
   ``We're bringing these cases because the U.S. government finds it
essential for air safety,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Gary
Librick, who prosecuted Gary Lee Anderson in Orlando.
   Anderson, 34, was convicted Monday of four counts of making false
statements on medical forms to obtain his pilot's licenses. He faces
up to 20 years in prison and $755,000 in fines.
   Anderson failed to report a 1983 conviction for drunken driving
and possession of marijuana and a 1987 conviction for reckless
driving, then lied to FBI agents who questioned him about the forms
in September, said the prosecutor.
   Also on Monday, William Dixon Gard, 41, a private pilot from
Punta Gorda, was convicted in Fort Myers federal court on two counts
of filing false statements, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Doug
Fraser. Gard faces 10 years in prison and $500,000 in fines.
   A third case is scheduled in Orlando this week.
   Defense attorneys criticized the felony charges.
   ``The heavy hammer of a felony prosecution is entirely
unwarranted,'' said Anderson's lawyer, former federal prosecutor Tom
Turner. ``Prosecution based on this form is a crime itself,'' Turner
told the federal jury in Orlando.
   The defense lawyer argued that the cases should be handled
administratively by the FAA.
   Anderson, a flying instructor and freight pilot, was fired from
his job with Flight Express in Orlando. He was released on bail, and
sentencing was set for March 20. He did not testify and would not
comment.
   ``I think it's a politically motivated witch hunt,'' said
Assistant Public Defender Ray Dvorak about the federal crackdown.
``It seems to me that they got their message across.''
   A computer audit has determined that 711,000 people have licenses
and permits from the Federal Aviation Administration, said FAA
spokesman Ben Lorigo in Washington. He said 10,300 pilots had their
driver's licenses suspended or revoked for drug and alcohol
offenses, and 7,850 failed to report it.
   ``It's essential that the FAA receive complete and truthful
information by those who fly recreationally or privately as
pilots,'' said prosecutor Librick.

<HEAD>Auto Insurers, Consumer Activists Square Off Over California
Proposition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Insurance industry officials told Congress on
Tuesday that California's recently approved initiative slashing auto
insurance rates was ``no mandate'' and would do nothing to control
soaring premiums.
   But consumer activist Ralph Nader and the author of California's
Proposition 103 testified to the same House panel that the measure
is an important first step toward reining in high insurance costs.
   Nader found a sympathetic audience in Rep. James Florio, D-N.J.,
chairman of the House commerce, consumer protection and
competitiveness subcommittee, which has held four hearings on auto
insurance in recent months.
   ``People are justifiably angry over the rates they pay,'' said
Florio, saying insurance rates have increased 10 percent to 15
percent over the last year, well ahead of overall inflation. ``And
with equal justification they are losing confidence in a system that
allows this to go on.''
   But William B. Snyder, chairman of the GEICO Corp., one of the
nation's largest insurers, said that Proposition 103 was the wrong
way to proceed.
   The measure, approved by California voters on Nov. 8 in a
campaign in which the insurance industry reportedly spent $75
million to defeat it, has so far been blocked in the courts.
   It would immediately reduce auto, home and business premiums by
20 percent. It would also establish a long-term system requiring
companies to increase their discounts for drivers with good safety
records and forcing firms to open their books and justify any future
rate increases.
   ``Fraud and chicanery are rampant,'' Snyder told the lawmakers in
his prepared statement, complaining that ``a large number of crooked
lawyers, medical doctors and chiropractors are available to any one
who wants to subvert'' the insurance system.
   ``The real answer to the problem is not the meaningless and
senseless insurance bashing about which we have heard so much, but
true claim cost control,'' he said.
   John B. Crosby, director of Citizens for No-Fault, an insurance
industry group that waged an unsuccessful battle against Proposition
103, noted that the initiative had been approved by a margin of
about 4.6 million to 4.4 million. Fifty of California's 58 counties
voted against the measure
   ``There is no mandate in the vote for Prop 103,'' said Crosby,
who blamed auto theft, fraud, health care costs and increasing
numbers of lawsuits for growing insurance costs.
   Nader, however, blamed the industry's ``waste, inefficiency and
inattention to loss prevention'' for the increasing premiums.
   ``Insurance customers will be standing up for their rights
against unreasonable insurance rates, arbitrary practices and
lobbying pressure by insurance companies and their corporate allies
to take away victims' rights,'' he said.
   Harvey Rosenfield, chair of Voter Revolt and author of
Proposition 103, accused the insurers of ``raw arrogance, bluster
and bullying tactics'' for trying to block the initiative and
threatening to leave the state if it is implemented.
   ``People want both immediate relief from years of high insurance
rates and long-term, fundamental reform of the insurance system,''
he said.

   Karl Marx has been cleaned up and will be his old
self again if President Mikhail S. Gorbachev calls to pay his
respects next week.
   Art students on Tuesday finished chipping away with surgeon's
scalpels to remove the last traces of paint that some anti-Marxist
four years ago oured over the massive bronze bust atop the grave in
north London.
   The students also regilded the famous exhortation, ``Workers of
all lands unite,'' from the 1848 ``Communist Manifesto'' inscribed
on the plinth of Cornish granite.
   ``We are highly privileged to work on Marx,'' said Karin Hignett,
23, climbing down from a makeshift trestle scaffold in Highgate
Cemetery, a vast graveyard that opened in 1839.
   ``But it was a bit monotonous,'' she confided clasping her arms
around herself in the damp and the cold.
   ``Plenty of people envy us. A friend of mine would give his life
to work on Marx's tomb,'' said Simone Boux, 21.
   ``It was black bitumastic paint and very difficult to remove. We
worked two days a week for four weeks to get it off,'' said Nick
Durnham, the students' tutor in stone conservation at the City and
Guilds of London Art School.
   ``There must have been a whole can of the paint poured over Marx
by someone who climbed up there,'' he said. ``The paint dribbled
down and hardened. We tried solvents and then found scraping with
scalpels and washing with cold water was best.''
   Marx was buried in 1883 and Laurence Bradshaw's sculpture of his
head was put up in 1956.
   Since then, anti-Marxist slogans have been painted on the plinth.
The bust was attacked with hammers, daubed with the British national
colors of red, white and blue, and someone even tried to blow it up.
   ``There's been an attempt to cut off the nose and it has four
great cuts made by an ax or chisel, but you can't see them unless
you get up there,'' he said.
   Jean Pateman, who runs a volunteer group caring for the cemetery,
said the cleanup had nothing to do with the scheduled visit of
Gorbachev.
   ``It's a coincidence, but if Mr. Gorbachev comes, Marx is
ready,'' she said.
   ``I think Mr. Gorbachev may very well come _ he didn't when he
was here in 1984,'' Durnham said.
   ``We were working on other memorials when the cemetery manager
asked us to take care of Marx. Then the London communists who look
after the Marx grave asked us to do the regilding and make sure it
was finished by the end of this week,'' he said.
   Marx was born in 1818 in Trier, now in West Germany, and spent
most of his life in exile for his political ideas and leadership of
working men's organizations. He settled in London in 1849, making a
patchy living from journalism and relying on handouts from his
friend and collaborator, Friedrich Engels.
   About 20 people turned up at Marx's funeral to hear Engels say:
``The greatest living thinker has ceased to think.''
   Marx lies between Claudia Jones from Trinidad who died in 1964
and a couple named Griffiths: John, died 1952, and Grace, died 1976.
   ``Anyone can be buried here, the humble and the eminent,'' said
Mrs. Pateman.
   ``We've just buried Anna, the last daughter of (composer) Gustav
Mahler, and (actor) Sir Ralph Richardson is over there.''

   After the crowds, noise and confusion of the
Liberty Weekend extravaganza two years ago, residents of Governors
Island consoled themselves with one thought: Nothing like it would
happen again.
   They were wrong. In the words of Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Paul
Milligan, ``The two major individuals in the world are coming here
to have lunch.''
   On Tuesday, the small island in New York Harbor, which is
administered by the Coast Guard and used for a base, was abustle
with preparations for the arrival Wednesday of Mikhail Gorbachev,
Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
   Even though it sits in the nation's busiest harbor and is just a
brief ferry ride from Manhattan, Governors Island is a quiet town,
barred to the public except for one day in the spring and one in the
fall when visitors are allowed to tour. The speed limit on the
island's roads _ 15 mph _ pretty much typifies the pace of life
enjoyed by its 4,000 residents, all of them connected to the Coast
Guard base.
   The 173-acre island was the epicenter of the four-day Statue of
Liberty relighting celebration in 1986. Some island residents who
survived that experienced an unwanted sense of deja vu this week.
   ``It took people a month to recover from the Statue of Liberty,''
recalled Henry Apicos, principal of the island's elementary school.
``The island was turned into a carnival. People felt imposed upon.''
   This time, restrictions necessitated by the visit ``are going to
create difficulties for some families,'' he said.
   On Sunday night, a four-page notice was handed out to residents
to inform them that for much of Wednesday there would be no driving
on the island and no ferry service. Hours at the Coast Guard mess
hall were changed, school was called off, and the Greg Smith
Singers' performance at St. Cornelius Chapel was canceled.
   Residents of ``high security areas'' have been told to leave
their homes or stay inside all afternoon. They can look out the
windows, but may not open them, ``peek from behind drawn shades'' or
stand on their porches.
   Although areas were set aside for islanders to view the leaders,
they had to arrive early, stay late, and bring identification.
``Mostly they'll see a lot of police and security people,'' Apicos
predicted.
   On Tuesday, ``No Parking Wednesday'' signs popped up around the
island, and parked cars were towed from along the motorcade route.
Outside the base's gymnasium, which was being converted into a giant
press room for 800 reporters, a flatbed truck deposited portable
toilets to replace bathrooms that had been converted into
photographers' darkrooms.
   Six Coast Guard men raked leaves in front of an apartment
building, grousing. ``This is what I went to school for?'' asked one.
   At Liberty Village, a new housing complex built on the spot where
Reagan threw the switch to relight the Statue of Liberty, a woman
and her two children tried to reach their car through a maze of
yellow mesh fence thrown up for security.
   ``This is because Reagan and Gorbachev are coming,'' she
explained. ``We're not usually caged up like this.''
   Coast Guard personnel have been working around the clock to set
up press facilities, install communications lines and construct
bleachers, Milligan said.
   ``Liberty Weekend was bigger than this, but it had a longer
planning period _ we learned about this a week ago,'' he said. ``But
the Coast Guard is good at crisis management, whether it's a
search-and-rescue mission or an oil spill or this.
   ``There's been a little grumbling, but people realize it's only
an inconvenience,'' Milligan said. ``This starts the relationship
between the U.S. and the Soviet Union for the next four years.
   ``We'll all remember this, from the smallest child to the
admiral.''

<HEAD>Government Says It Intends to End Rationing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Tuesday it hopes to end
gasoline rationing April 1 and will end meat rationing as part of an
experiment in one province at the start of 1989.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban made the announcements at a news
conference, in which he stressed the government is committed to
reforming the economy.
   ``The intention and the goal of the government is to lift all
those forms of rationing,'' Urban said.
   Poles receive monthly gasoline ration cards based on the size of
their automobiles that entitle them to buying a limited amount of
fuel at the official price of about 91 cents per gallon.
   Ration coupons entitle motorists to 6.2 gallons of fuel a month
for small cars and 9.4 gallons a month for big cars at the official
price.
   Since June, Poles also have been permitted to buy gas at a
``commercial price'' of about $2.50 per gallon.
   Poles' average monthly wage is about $112.
   The spokesman said that while no final decision has been made,
the government would like to lift gas rationing April 1.
   Urban said the decision was more difficult in the area of meat
rationing, because it was not certain whether the government could
assure adequate supplies of meat to the market if rationing was
lifted. He also said the concept of rationing remained popular among
a majority of Poles because it allows them to buy meat relatively
cheaply.
   Most Polish families are entitled to 5{ pounds of meat per person
per month at controlled official prices. Meat can also be purchased
at private farmers' markets for about four times as much.
   Ham costs about $1.80 a pound at official prices or as much as
$7.27 a pound in private markets.
   As an experiment, Urban said, one of Poland's 49 provinces would
cease to use meat ration cards as of Jan. 1. This would allow
authorities to gauge the effect of lifting the ration-card system,
he said. Urban did not specify the province where the experiment was
to take place.
   After six months, he said, ``only if it is possible will we
propose to society to lift the coupons ... in such a way that it
could gain social approval.''
   Urban also said the government was formulating price increase
plans for 1989 that envisioned the overall inflation rate at about
50 percent. Inflation for 1988 has been estimated at more than 70
percent.

   A law that stripped governors of control over
training missions by their states' National Guard is
unconstitutional, an appeals court ruled today in the second
challenge this year to the law.
   Both cases developed over Guard trips to Central America.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling came in a lawsuit
filed by Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich challenging the Montgomery
Amendment, which was enacted in 1986 and effectively eliminated a
requirement that governors give consent to training missions for
their Guard units. Prior to 1986, state units could not be sent on
federal training missions without such consent.
   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in October rejected a
challenge to the amendment filed by Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis.
   Perpich claimed in the lawsuit that, but for the Montgomery
Amendment, he would not have allowed his state's National Guard to
conduct a training mission in Central America. The U.S. Department
of Defense had ordered Minnesota guardsmen to active duty for that
mission.
   The majority of a three-judge panel of the appeals court, in
reversing the ruling of a federal district judge, concluded that the
Montgomery Amendment deprives the states of the ``authority of
training the militia'' and violates Article One of the Constitution.
   The majority said the Constitution framers clearly intended the
states to have control over part of the the nation's military,
except in the case of an immediate threat, as a check on the power
of the federal government.
   ``We understand that today the nation's military forces often
need to respond instantaneously _ that the federal government may
need to use troops in a variety of situations short of decleared
wars,'' the majority wrote in the 80-page opinion. ``Yet, the world
has not changed so dramatically that we can no longer abide by the
provisions of our Constitution, and we are not convinced that the
national defense will be harmed by our respecting reserved state
authority over the National Guard.''
   The Montgomery Amendment was passed after governors in some
states began objecting to National Guard training missions in
Central America. Until then, governors had the veto power under the
Armed Forces Reserve Act but did not use it, according to Minnesota
Chief Deputy Attorney General John Tunheim.
   Minnesota first argued the case in July 1987 with support from 11
other states before Chief U.S. District Court Judge Donald D. Alsop.
The judge ruled in August that governors have no constitutional
authority to withhold consent for National Guard training missions
in Central America or elsewhere, and thus upheld the amendment.
   The number of states supporting the appeal dropped to five,
Tunheim said. They were Massachusetts, Ohio, Colorado, Vermont and
Maine. Some of the support was lost because the National Guard has
threatened to withdraw federal funds from units in some states where
governors oppose Central American training missions, Tunheim said.
   Justice Department lawyer Deborah Kant argued that governors have
no authority under the Constitution to redirect foreign policy by
vetoing military training missions. She said the Montgomery
Amendment leaves intact gubernatorial veto power if guard units are
needed at home.
   ``They just cannot object for foreign policy reasons,'' Kant told
the judges.
   Tunheim pointed out that foreign policy objectives of the U.S.
government are protected under the Army Clause of the Constitution.
Under that clause, he said, governors have no power over National
Guard units when the president or Congress declares a national
emergency or other special circumstances requiring National Guard
training or action.
   In Boston, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Oct. 25
issued a one-sentence order affirming a May 6 decision by U.S.
District Judge Robert Keeton, who upheld federal supremacy over the
National Guard.
   In Washington, National Guard Bureau spokesman Dan Donohue said
today's decision meant two federal court circuits were now at odds
with each other, suggesting further legal action was likely.
   ``But no decisions have been made officially on an appeal,'' the
spokesman said. ``We're just now hearing about this.''
   According to the spokesman, there are currently about 115,000 men
and women serving in the Air National Guard and another 460,000
serving in the Army National Guard.
   The Pentagon is planning to send about 6,000 Guard members from
across the country to Honduras during 1989 for road-building and
engineering exercises, Donohue said. There are no such exercises
under way at the moment because of the rainy season in Central
America, he added.
   U.S. Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss., whose name is
carried on the amendment because of his role is creating it, said he
was disturbed by today's ruling.
   ``If 50 governors are allowed to veto Guard missions because they
don't like the way our foreign policy is administered, it would have
an adverse impact on training and would raise questions about the
availability of the Guard to meet its considerable defense
responsibilities,'' Montgomery said in a statement released from
Washington.

   Two American Indian activists who were
acquitted in a federal trial after they took over the The Robesonian
newspaper office were indicted by a grand jury Tuesday on state
kidnapping charges.
   Eddie Hatcher and Timothy Jacobs, both Tuscarora Indians, took
over the newspaper office and held up to 20 people hostage for 10
hours before surrendering. They said they took over the office to
protest local corruption.
   A federal court jury freed the two in October following a trial
on federal hostage-taking charges.
   The Robeson County grand juey indicted Hatcher, 31, and Jacobs,
20, on 14 counts each of second-degree state kidnapping charges
stemming from the occupation at the newspaper office last Feb. 1.
   Following the indictments, Superior Court Judge Robert Hobgood
issued orders to arrest Hatcher and Jacobs and set bond at $10,000
secured for each defendant on each charge, a total of $140,000 each.
   State Bureau of Investigation agent James Bowman said indictments
are expected later by the grand jury against co-conspirators in the
hostage case as well as indictments against others for obstruction
of justice. Bowman would not elaborate.

<HEAD>City Gears Up For Soviet Leader's Visit</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Superpower Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deployment of thousands of police officers and
traffic agents began Tuesday to ensure the safety and smooth passage
of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev during his three-day visit in the
midst of the holiday crush.
   ``It really is a maximum security operation,'' said Gillian
Martin Sorensen, the city's liaison to the United Nations.
   Tremendous snarls, already dubbed ``Gorbylock,'' were expected
when traffic, swollen with Christmas shoppers, is stopped on some of
New York's busiest streets so that Gorbachev's 45-car motorcade can
wheel through the city.
   Sorensen said the Police Department, which assigned 6,600
officers to the Gorbachev detail, was working closely with the
Secret Service, the State Department and the United Nation's
250-member police force to coordinate protection for Gorbachev.
   On Tuesday afternoon, for Gorbachev's arrival at Kennedy
International Airport on Long Island and travel to the Soviet
Mission in Manhattan, officials ordered closings of the Van Wyck
Expressway and the Grand Central Parkway in Queens, the Triborough
Bridge and FDR Drive in Manhattan to ``make sure they're completely
clear'' for the Soviet motorcade.
   ``It's gridlock for peace so I guess we can bear with it,'' said
Nelson Castillo of the city Department of Transportation.
   ``Given the stature of the Soviet leader, we've got appropriate
security, which happens to be extraordinary in this case,'' said
Port Authority Police Lt. Frank Talbert.
   At least five protest groups will demonstrate outside the United
Nations during Gorbachev's appearance before the General Assembly.
And there is a history of anti-Soviet sentiment in the city,
including the 1984 firebombing of a car at the Soviet residence in
the Bronx, the 1986 tear-gassing of a Moiseyev Dance Company
performance and a 1987 bomb scare when the Bolshoi Ballet opened at
Lincoln Center.
   Since Gorbachev had no scheduled public appearances after his
arrival Tuesday, law enforcement authorities focused more concern on
Wednesday, which one police official called ``the day of infamy''
with extensive traffic disruption.
   Wednesday's itinerary, released by the Police Department, had
Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, visiting the observation deck atop
one of the 110-story World Trade Center towers in lower Manhattan
after the Soviet leader's luncheon meeting with President Reagan and
Vice President Bush.
   Their 45-car motorcade then is to pass the New York Stock
Exchange and go through Wall Street and toward Times Square in mid
Manhattan _ all in the heart of rush hour.
   Among Gorbachev's expected sightseeing stops Thursday were the
Javits Convention Center on the West Side of Manhattan, the
Metropolitan Museum of Art uptown on the East Side, and Central Park.

<TEXT>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Soviet Union, which once scorned the United
Nations, has embraced the world body under President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev as a prized foreign policy tool to promote his ``new
political thinking'' and help extricate Moscow from regional
conflicts.
   Now, the Soviet Union has become the mover and shaker, the
biggest booster of an international forum it once despised as
ineffectual or Western-biased. Now, more than ever, the Soviet Union
appears to be a team player. The United States appears self-isolated.
   Gorbachev, who plans to make his first address to the 159-nation
world body on Wednesday, is expected to deliver a dazzling tour de
force on visionary foreign policy. He is expected to cover issues
ranging from the environment to conventional disarmament to the
Middle East, and the need to promote the United Nations as a
once-discarded multilateral forum whose time has come.
   For several years, the Soviet Union has been carrying out a
public relations offensive at the United Nations and has launched
initiatives here as part of an international pattern of new Soviet
ideas on peacemaking on almost every continent.
   Gorbachev's visit comes at a time when the U.S. relations with
the world body, strained during the entire Reagan administration,
have soured abruptly over the U.S. refusal to grant Palestine
Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat a visa to speak here
last week.
   The United States also is more than half a billion dollars in
arrears in its U.N. budget and peacekeeping dues.
   By contrast, the Soviet Union has been repaying its back dues and
now owes $159 million in regular budget and peacekeeping dues.
   The Soviet Union has discovered the United Nations, which it
either had ignored or had exploited as a polarized forum where it
joined the Third World in scoring points against the United States.
   But today the East-West climate had warmed dramatically, and the
Soviet Union is participating as never before in the United Nations.
It is calling for the world body to play a larger role in
peacekeeping, resolving international conflicts, in verification of
disarmament and in fields from outer space to narcotics trafficking.
   It has become among the least ideological, least contentious
members, known more today for listening than for rhetoric.
   The Soviet Union has viewed the U.N.-mediated agreement on
Afghanistan as a face-saving way to end its involvement in a costly
conflict and withdraw its troops. Likewise, the Soviet Union has
encouraged U.N. peacemaking efforts in Cambodia, where Moscow has
backed the Vietnamese occupation. It also sees a U.N. plan for
southern Africa as a means to end the involvement of Soviet-backed
Cuban troops in Angola.
   This year, for the first time, the United States and Soviet Union
voted together on the Afghanistan question, expressing satisfaction
with U.N. efforts and Soviet troop withdrawal.
   While the United States tends to resolve its problems without the
United Nations, the Soviet Union now tends to work within the U.N.
system.
   Now, it is the Soviet Union, more often than the United States,
which votes with the majority and is known for compromise, seeking
consensus, floating ideas, then going back to the drawing board and
revising them. For the Soviet Union, all ideas appear to be open for
discussion.
   The Soviet Union now emphasizes its ``new thinking'' and a shift
away from the old East-West adversarial relationship. It now talks
of multipolarity, an interdependent world, security which depends on
confidence, not arms, and disarmament to a level of
``self-sufficiency,'' at which no one can successfully launch
aggression.
   The Soviet Union has been pushing for broader U.N. peacekeeping
powers, including a U.N. naval force in the Persian Gulf which would
eliminate the need for a U.S. naval presence in the Iran-Iraq war.
   It has called for meetings of the 15-member Security Council at
the foreign ministers level to discuss trouble spots around the
world. For several years it has been promoting ``a new comprehensive
system of international security'' _ a vague concept covering
everything from humanitarian issues to greater openness on military
spending.
   The United States opposes the concept as being undefined,
encroaching on national prerogatives and possibly giving the United
Nations too great a role.
   Last September Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
delivered an extraordinary, even revolutionary, U.N. speech in which
he said class struggle played no part in Soviet foreign policy. He
devoted more discussion to the environment than to disarmament and
extolled democracy and the rule of law in international affairs.
   On Wednesday, Gorbachev is expected to do no less, and even go
further.
   ``President Gorbachev's speech,'' said one Soviet official, ``is
likely to be a Christmas present to the people of America and the
world who want a safer world.''

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, facing turmoil at
home, could be in a hurry to make deals with the United States. But
President-elect George Bush, with his administration just taking
shape, has every reason to tread slowly.
   An army of Kremlin spokesmen has descended on the United States,
hinting broadly that the Soviet leader, in his speech at the United
Nations on Wednesday, will make new proposals, possibly on cuts in
nuclear or conventional arms.
   Central Committee aide Nikolai Shishkin told U.S. television
viewers that Gorbachev would make ``a Christmas gift to the American
people and to mankind'' during his visit to the United Nations.
   The White House reacted coolly, not wanting to repeat the
freewheeling Reykjavik summit.
   ``We have a president who is leaving office in a few weeks, who
is not going to be making any promises that he is not here to
keep,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``And we have a new president who will be taking office in a few
weeks, who is not going to be making commitments when he doesn't
have an administration in power that can fully analyze and make
these judgments,'' said Fitzwater, who will continue as spokesman in
the Bush administration.
   The American side is wary of repeating the detente experience,
entering into broad agreements with the Kremlin only to see
superpower relations plummet.
   The Americans forecast no agreements from the lunch Wednesday
among President Reagan, Gorbachev and Bush. About the most that
should be expected from the Americans is a commitment for a formal
summit early in the Bush administration.
   ``We are being very realistic,'' Fitzwater said. ``We find
nothing embarrassing or in any way negative about characterizing
this meeting as a friendly discussion, an open airing of issues
between us and a healthy approach towards continuity.''
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, expressed chagrin.
   ``It is perfectly natural that the new administration will need
some time to get its bearings in the complexity of domestic and
international problems. But it is very important not to drag out
this period. Marking time in international affairs, especially in
the domain of arms limitation and reduction, is tantamount not only
to loss of time, but to backsliding,'' Tass said in a statement
distributed as Gorbachev left Moscow for New York.
   Gorbachev's own status is mixed. He consolidated his control over
the Kremlin this fall, assuming the post of president and lowering
his two leading Politburo critics a notch.
   But his reform policies have not put more food on Soviet tables
or new clothes in Soviet closets. Soviet officials acknowledged this
year, for the first time, that their budget was running a deficit,
signaling that they have scarce funds for the capital improvements
that may be needed to get the economy going again.
   So Gorbachev comes to the United States looking for agreements
that could provide more Western credits and technology.
   At home, Gorbachev's policy of greater openness has brought many
long suppressed problems to the surface.
   The Baltic republics of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia are
pressing for greater autonomy, and racial antagonisms have forced
the Kremlin virtually to impose a state of martial law in the
republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan in the south.
   Gorbachev, to give himself breathing room at home and to
compensate for the problems of perestroika, or economic
restructuring, has been moving fast on the diplomatic front, keeping
at least a step ahead of the cautious Americans.
   In a dramatic first, a Soviet envoy negotiated on Monday and
Sunday directly with Afghan guerrillas. Western diplomats forecast
that the Soviets would allow the Moslem guerrillas a role in a
transitional government and the Red Army would meet its withdrawal
deadline of Feb. 15.
   Gorbachev also was taking steps to improve relations with Western
Europe and China, further reducing tension on the Soviet periphery.
   Bush insisted that he would participate in the luncheon only as
vice president. But, he added: ``I expect they'll be aware they're
talking to the next president.''
   He has been prudently assembling a foreign policy team of
pragmatists.
   On a personal level, Bush has been waiting for a long time for
the top job, cooling his heels for eight years in the White House
wings under Reagan. He faces the unenviable task of shrinking the
budget and trade deficits, and the challenge of reasserting the
leadership role for the United States in a changing world.

   When Nikita Khrushchev addressed the U.N.
General Assembly in 1960, the Soviet leader pounded a shoe on his
desk and assured Americans that ``we will bury you.''
   On Tuesday, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent word of
his intention to seek ``real political cooperation'' with the United
States one day before his speech to the General Assembly.
   Times have changed in 28 years. Soviet attitudes toward the West
and the United Nations are radically different with widespread talk
of diplomacy and cooperation.
   In 1960, Khrushchev was enraged over Secretary-General Dag
Hammarskjold's action in sending U.N. peacekeeping troops to the
Congo, then a key Soviet client state.
   ``The General Assembly of 1960 was the greatest circus in the
history of the United Nations,'' said Brian Urquhart, who then was
undersecretary-general in charge of peacekeeping operations.
   In those days, world leaders often spent weeks attending the
General Assembly and sat with their delegations much of the time.
Roaming the floor of the Assembly were Cuba's Fidel Castro, King
Hussein of Jordan, Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nassar, President Dwight D.
Eisenhower and Khrushchev, destined to be the star performer.
   Sometimes crude and profane, and always easily angered,
Khrushchev created the most memorable scene in U.N. debate by
pounding a shoe on the Soviet delegation's desk for a point of order.
   Philippine delegate Lorenzo Sumulong had just referred to the
nations of Eastern Europe as being ``deprived of the free exercise
of their civil and political rights and which have been swallowed
up, so to speak, by the Soviet Union,'' when Khrushchev could stand
no more.
   The Soviet leader slipped off his right shoe and waved it
menacingly at Sumulong. The debate continued. The Soviet leader
began pounding the shoe on the delegation's desk, shocking the
assembly, and shouting: ``Point of order.''
   Continuing, Khrushchev called Sumulong a ``toady of American
imperialism.''
   Khrushchev, bellowing in Russian, said the Congo was struggling
to throw off imperialism, and then told General Assembly President
Frederick Boland that ``we live on Earth not by the grace of God
nor, sir, by your grace, but by the strength and intelligence of the
great people of the Soviet Union and of all the peoples which are
fighting for their independence.''
   ``Khrushchev got so abusive that the Irish president of the
assembly, Freddie Boland, broke the gavel in calling him to order,
and the head of the gavel flew off into the General Assembly,'' said
Urquhart.
   The most famous shoe in political history remained perched on the
desk of the Soviet delegation.
   A U.N. visit by a Soviet leader is a rarity; the foreign minister
usually delivers the annual address to the General Assembly.
   Between Khrushchev and Gorbachev, the only other top-ranking
Soviet visitor was Premier Alexei Kosygin, the chief administrator
of the government, who came to the United Nations in 1967 to support
Arab complaints against Israel.

   The 360-year-old royal warship Wasa
moved to its final berth Tuesday with hundreds of people gathering
in gray and snowy weather to cheer its last voyage.
   Designed as the mightiest ship of its day, the Wasa sank on its
maiden voyage in 1628. It was salvaged from Stockholm bay in 1961
and displayed in a temporary museum, winning acclaim as one of the
best preserved ships of its kind.
   It was placed on a pontoon and encased in an aluminum shield to
protect it during the 275-yard voyage to the site of a new museum
under construction.
   A 24-pound cannon retrieved from the Wasa roared the announcement
of the ship's arrival at its final port of call.
   ``I have dreamt of this moment and gone through it so many times
in my mind that it feels like a `deja vu' experience,'' said Anders
Franzen, who rediscovered the ship and supervised its salvage.
   The new museum, which will open in June 1990, is a huge $28
million copper-colored enclosure facing the royal palace on the
Stockholm waterfront.
   The move ends years of discussions on the fate of the ship, which
was to be the flagship of a Swedish empire stretching from the
Scandinavian peninsula across the Baltic and into Russia.
   Top-heavy with armaments, the Wasa caught a mighty gust of wind
and capsized only minutes after being launched.
   Crowds lined the shore to see if it would topple once more.
   ``It has been a constant nightmare that history will repeat
itself,'' said Franzen, a retired scientist.
   Transporting the ship into the new dock became a test of
precision for the tug towing the 22-yard-high encasement, he said.
   The Wasa, adorned with most of its original 700 gold-leaf
sculptures, has become a symbol of ancient Sweden at the height of
its power. It attracts 500,000 tourists a year.

<TEXT>
   A lawyer for the Boy Scouts of America said
Tuesday that psychological problems plaguing a boy who was sexually
molested by his scoutmaster stem from his unstable family life.
   The family of the youth, who is now 17, is suing the scouts and
former scoutmaster Carlton L. Bittenbender, saying the boy suffers
from a stress disorder because of Bittenbender's assaults and that
the scouts' system for detecting child abusers is inadequate and
ineffective.
   But attorney Robert E. Cadigan told a Fairfax County, Va.,
Circuit Court jury in his opening arguments that the teen, whose
name is not being publicly revealed, required psychiatric treatment
as early as the third grade, long before he met Bittenbender at age
12.
   ``The fact is, this youth had many problems even before
Bittenbender came on the scene,'' said Cadigan.
   The boy willingly submitted to a sexual relationship with his
scoutmaster for 10 or 11 months, Cadigan told the jury of three men
and six women. ``Evidence will show that at no time when this
relationship was going on did (the youth) have emotional problems.''
   Instead, Cadigan charged, the boy had to go to a psychiatric
hospital two months after the relationship with Bittenbender ended
in Dec. 1985 because he was acting out his anger over long-term
family problems.
   ``When Bittenbender's name was brought up (during the youth's
hospitalization),'' said Cadigan, ``it caused no adverse emotional
response from (the boy). On the contrary, he idolized Bittenbender.
   ``It was his parents' visits that caused an adverse emotional
response,'' he said.
   The youth's mother had a sexual relationship with Bittenbender
for about four months during the period when the scoutmaster was
molesting the boy, Cadigan said.
   The boy's father was a homosexual, had a drinking problem, and
moved out of the family's home late last year, Cadigan said. He also
said a psychologist had diagnosed the father as being a ``possible
manic depressive.''
   The family's attorney, William A. Barton, said Monday that
Bittenbender was able to evade detection because the organization,
fearing negative publicity, was reluctant to publicize abuse cases
and identify abusers. He also said there were no internal safeguards
against potential child molesters within the scouts.
   On Monday, Barton had also discussed the problems troubling the
boy's parents.
   Barry Bach, another attorney for the scouts, said the
organization kept confidential files to screen out people who were
unfit to lead scout troops.
   Bittenbender is serving a 30-year prison term for his 1985
conviction for sodomy and aggravated sexual battery against three
boys under the age of 13, including the youth represented in the
lawsuit. He had had a prior history of molesting boys that resulted
in dismissals from New England public schools and convictions on
four counts of second-degree sexual assault as scoutmaster of a
Rhode Island troop in 1981.
   The boy's family is seeking about $100,000 for his health care
costs plus punitive damages.

   Two Tuscarora Indians who were acquitted
of federal charges stemming from the takeover of a Robeson County
newspaper were indicted by a state grand jury Tuesday on 14 counts
of second-degree kidnapping.
   Superior Court Judge Robert Hobgood issued arrest orders for
Eddie Hatcher and Timothy Jacobs after the indictments were
returned. Hobgood set bond for the two men at $140,000 each.
   Hatcher, 31, and Jacobs, 20, were acquitted by a federal jury
Oct. 14 on hostage-taking and firearms violations. The charges
stemmed from the Feb. 1 takeover of The Robesonian newspaper in
Lumberton, in which up to 20 people were held hostage.
   Hatcher and Jacobs never denied taking over the newspaper, but
said they were trying to save their lives by drawing attention to
Hatcher's claims that he had information linking public officials to
drug trafficking.
   State Bureau of Investigation agent James Bowman said he expected
more indictments to come later against alleged co-conspirators and
others suspected of obstruction of justice. He would not elaborate.
   The indictments named only 14 hostages as prosecution witnesses
in the case. Bowman said investigators believed some of the hostages
did not wish to prosecute the men.
   The six hostages not listed in the indictments included
Robesonian editor Bob Horne and newspaper employees Ricky McKinnon
and Raymond Godfrey, as well as three hostages who were not
newspaper employees.
   The maximum sentence for second-degree kidnapping is 30 years on
each count. The presumptive sentence _ the sentence normally given _
is nine years.

<TEXT>
   A state governor on Tuesday joined a
dispute between some Roman Catholics and the Vatican over the naming
of Cologne's new archbishop.
   North-Rhine Westfalia Gov. Johannes Rau said there would be
``far-reaching consequences for state-Vatican relations'' if the
Vatican does not work with the state to resolve the dispute. He did
not elaborate.
   The position has been vacant since Cardinal Joseph Hoeffner died
in October 1987.
   Cologne's archbishop is potentially the most influential church
post in the nation. He traditionally has headed the West German
Bishops' Conference.
   The archdiocese is made up of the states of North-Rhine Westfalia
and the Rhineland-Palatinate.
   Rau, a Lutheran, said any attempt by the Vatican to resolve the
problem by making the appointment itself would violate a 1929
agreement giving the states veto power over the appointment.
   ``We insist that (Cologne) church leaders come to us with their
choice,'' Rau said.
   According to terms of the agreement, a panel of high-ranking
Catholics in Cologne is charged with selecting one of three
candidates suggested by the Vatican.
   After the selection, the two states have the right to challenge
the choice if they have serious objections about his political views.
   Church officials in Cologne have been unable to make a decision.
They have refused comment on the selection process, but it is widely
believed the panel is unhappy with the Vatican's choices.
   Pope John Paul II on Tuesday had a private audience with Bishop
Karl Lehmann, president of the West German Bishops Conference. No
details were released.
   One of the pope's prime candidates for the Cologne archbishopric,
Berlin's Cardinal Joachim Meisner, was reported to have given up his
candidacy for the position.
   The Bonn-based Die Welt newspaper on Dec. 1 said Meisner took
himself out of the running after an audience with the pope. The
newspaper said Meisner's candidacy was opposed in Cologne and by the
two state governments.
   On Dec. 1, Rhineland-Palatinate Gov. Bernhard Vogel also told the
Vatican not to violate the agreement.

<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former finance officer for Lyndon H.
LaRouche Jr. testified Tuesday that he resigned in mid-1986 after
realizing that millions of dollars in loans to the political
eccentric's organization weren't going to be repaid, but he said he
was unaware of any policy to refuse to honor the debts.
   Wayne Hintz told jurors in LaRouche's mail and tax fraud
conspiracy trial in U.S. District Court that he got no response to a
series of memos to his superiors _ including LaRouche _ warning of
an alarming growth in loan debts.
   Hintz also was disturbed, he said, when regional fund-raisers in
late 1985 began seeking forgiveness of loans.
   ``It was not an easy thing to do,'' he said. ``It had not been
attempted until recently as a systematic approach to reducing
indebtedness.''
   Hintz said he finally quit in June 1986 when his time devoted to
managing the loan debt was reduced and he was forced to take on new
fund-raising efforts, Hintz said.
   ``It became clear to you that the loans weren't going to be
repaid?'' asked defense attorney Michael Reilly.
   ``Yes,'' Hintz replied.
   ``You felt that in good conscience you couldn't continue to be
part of that process?''
   ``Yes.''
   But later, under questioning by other defense attorneys, Hintz
said he did not know of any official policy to deliberately refuse
to pay off the loans as promised, except for short periods of time
when cash revenues were running low.
   ``There was no policy I was aware of not to repay the loans,''
Hintz said.
   Hintz testified as government prosecutors neared the completion
of their case against LaRouche, a perennial minor-party presidential
candidate, in the third week of the trial.
   LaRouche and six associates are charged with mail fraud and
conspiracy for allegedly raising more than $30 million in loans from
supporters with no intention of repaying them.
   In addition, LaRouche is charged with conspiring to defraud the
Internal Revenue Service by having all his personal expenses paid
from funds of various corporations he controls. The government says
LaRouche has filed no federal income tax returns since 1978.
   If convicted of all 13 counts against him, LaRouche faces a
maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and fines totaling $3.25
million. He has denied any wrongdoing.
   Hintz said that at one point in late 1985 loans accounted for
more than half the LaRouche organization's weekly income of $600,000
and the percentage was growing at a rate that alarmed him.
   He said his superiors offered to allocate $80,000 a week to make
payments on some loans primarily involving hardship cases or those
that were targets of litigation. He said his bosses also agreed to
impose a ceiling on new loans.
   But he said these measures weren't nearly enough to ``help us get
out of the woods.'' By the time he resigned, Hintz said, ``I did not
know how it would be possible'' to reduce the indebtedness.
   ``I had run out of ideas, an image of how this might be done,''
he said.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan will hold a prime time news
conference Thursday, likely the last such formal question-and-answer
exchange before he leaves office Jan. 20.
   ``Be nice. It's his last one,'' first lady Nancy Reagan told
reporters Tuesday after she accepted the official White House
Christmas tree.
   Chief presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked whether it
would be Reagan's last news conference, said, ``Well, this is the
December press conference, and you just never know after that.''
   The session, to be held in the East Room of the White House, will
be Reagan's fifth formal news conference this year and 46th of his
nearly 8-year-old presidency.
   Two of Reagan's previous four news conferences this year were
held out of the country _ one at the conclusion of his summit with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow on June 1, and
another, just 20 days later at the end of the seven-nation economic
summit in Toronto.
   The session will come a day after Reagan's meeting in New York
with Gorbachev. Besides discussing East-West relations, Reagan
likely will be asked to state his views on the pending trial of
former aide Oliver L. North, a key defendant in the Iran-Contra
case. He also will surely be asked about his personal feelings as
his two-term administration draws to a close.
   By historical standards, Reagan has held relatively few formal
question-and-answer sessions with news reporters, and this was
criticized recently by a Harvard commission of scholars and
journalists.
   Reacting to that report in mid-October, Fitzwater suggested that
the institution of the presidential press conference is overrated as
a means of communicating with the people. Fitzwater said no chief
executive should be expected to fulfill a quota on such
question-and-answer sessions.
   The Harvard report said White House news conferences have fallen
into ``a serious state of disarray'' under Reagan.
   Fitzwater recently was named by President-elect George Bush to be
press secretary in the Bush White House. The presidential spokesman
said he would not guess how frequently Bush would hold news
conferences.

   President-elect George Bush today named Texas
oilman Robert Mosbacher as secretary of commerce and tapped Carla
Hills, the first woman picked for a high-level post in the incoming
administration, to be special trade representative.
   Bush also named Michael Boskin, a Stanford University professor
of economics and a campaign adviser, to head his Council of Economic
Advisers.
   Turning to foreign policy, Bush also said CIA Director William
Webster would remain in his post, the latest in a string of holdover
appointments from the Reagan administration.
   The president-elect completed an assortment of appointments by
naming Thomas Pickering, the former ambassador to Israel, Nigeria,
El Salvador and Jordan, as his ambassador to the United Nations.
   Bush is not expected to make additional nominations until after
his meeting in New York on Wednesday with President Reagan and
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Careful to avoid impinging on President Reagan's final weeks in
power, Bush said he would attend the superpower s years than he
would like to admit _ more than three decades. The Texas oilman was
a key fund-raiser in Bush's winning presidential campaign.
   Fielding questions after making his announcements, Bush said
neither Pickering nor Webster would hold Cabinet rank.
   He said both men would be invited to Cabinet meetings as needed,
but said there was no point in having the United Nations ambassador
sitting in for Cabinet discussions of agriculture policy _ something
Bush recalled doing while serving at the U.N. in the 1970s.
   He said Webster would stay in his post for an ``open-ended''
period. There has been frequent speculation that he would stay in
his job for only a few months.
   In tapping Boskin, Bush named a man who helped design the
``flexible freeze'' that serves as the cornerstone of his
deficit-cutting proposals. Boskin also was involved in Bush's
campaign proposal to cut the capital gains tax.
   Mosbacher and Ms. Hills will oversee the nation's trade policy.
The office of U.S. Trade Representative negotiates trade agreements
and the secretary of commerce enforces them and seeks to expand
markets for U.S. goods.
   Mosbacher will take over Commerce from former steel executive C.
William Verity, who has held the job for only a year. Reagan
appointed Verity after the death of Commerce Secretary Malcolm
Baldrige in a horseback riding accident.
   The sources said Mosbacher had been promised the job several
weeks ago, but that the FBI background check on him had taken longer
than expected because of his vast financial holdings.
   Ms. Hills will succeed U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter
to a job that has become more sensitive as the national trade
deficit has risen to record levels. It was $170 billion last year
and is running at an annual rate of $137 billion this year.
   Bush transition sources said that the vice president would not
name a secretary of defense before he and Reagan meet on Wednesday
in New York with Gorbachev. The sources said Tower remains the
favorite for the post.
   New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, who will be Bush's chief of
staff, said today in Concord, N.H., that the Defense Department's
top echelon may be named in a batch of as many as five appointments.
   The naming of a new secretary of defense and his subordinates
``is being measured in two handfuls,'' he said.
   Earlier today, Bush told Cabinet veteran Elizabeth Dole that he
would like her to participate in the new administration but no job
commitments were made, an aide said.
   Mrs. Dole, a former transportation secretary, and Bush spent
about 45 minutes together over breakfast, according Steve Hart,
Bush's spokesman.
   The vice president ate lunch with Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.,
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Earlier today,
Rostenkowski suggested raising the 9.1-cents-a-gallon federal
gasoline tax as a way of boosting government revenue and easing the
deficit.
   Asked about taxes, Rostenkowski said: ``I don't know. It will be
a decision the president-elect is going to have to make. But I'm in
the tax business.''
   ``I used to be in that business when I served under him (on Ways
and Means),' interjected Bush, a former congressman from Texas. Bush
called their talks confidential, but said both he and Rostenkowski
``want to move this country forward.''
   Meantime, a spokeswoman for Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., said he had
not met with Bush transition people about the possibility of
becoming the secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
   ``He is planning to go into the private sector,'' Mary Burnette
said.
   Kemp, whose own presidential ambitions fell by the wayside early
in the 1988 primary season, has long been rumored as a strong
candidate for the HUD job.

   One of the factors expected to contribute to
traffic problems during Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's visit is
the size of his motorcade.
   According to police, the streets he travels on will have to be
cleared of traffic for Gorbachev's entourage, which will be
comprised of up to 45 vehicles.
   Police Chief Robert Johnston Jr. said the motorcade will include
American and Soviet secret service teams, police details and mobile
reserves and vehicles of Emergency Medical Services, the city's
ambulance corps.

   The U.S. Postal Service lost $597 million in
the 1988 fiscal year but expects to finish the new year about the
same amount to the good, officials said Tuesday.
   Final figures for fiscal 1988, which ended in October, were
reported at the monthly meeting of the agency's board of governors
and released at headquarters here.
   The loss of $597 million included payments of $510 million to the
federal treasury. The Postal Service has not received a government
subsidy since 1982.
   The postal rate increase that took effect April 4 is expected to
move the agency into the black in the current fiscal year, with
projections calling for it to finish between $550 million and $600
million to the good.
   Overall, the Postal Service has been in the black five times in
the last 10 years.
   When it was made an independent federal agency in the early
1970s, the post office was directed to break even over the long term
and its subsidy was phased out over time.
   Breaking even has required periodic rate increases, currently
scheduled about every three years. The next rate hike is expected to
be filed in 1990, to take effect in 1991.

<HEAD>Relief Officials Say Famine Will Be Repeated Next Year</HEAD>

   Famine will ravage southern Sudan again
next year even if the civil war ends, and emergency food airlifts
now under way will do nothing to stave it off, U.N. relief officials
said Tuesday.
   Most survivors of this year's famine, which claimed hundreds of
thousands of victims, are too weak to till the fields they abandoned
because of the fighting, the officials said.
   The town of Aweil typifies the desperation facing this African
country, one of the world's poorest, which spends $1 million a day
trying to crush a 5{-year-old rebellion in the Christian and animist
south against the Moslem north.
   A U.N. official who visited Aweil last week called it ``a town of
graves.''
   Aweil, 580 miles southwest of Khartoum, is among the targets of
an airlift that began Sunday to deliver sorghum, oil and medicines.
   Relief planes land at Wau, 45 miles southwest of Aweil and
capital of the Bahr el-Ghazal region. Organizers for the
International Committee of the Red Cross hope to ship supplies from
Wau to Aweil and other towns.
   The relief effort, which also includes flights from the Kenyan
border town of Lokichokio to rebel-held areas, is the first to
operate under pledges from both sides to give the planes safe
passage.
   Another airlift, organized by U.N. organizations and the Sudanese
government relief, is sending relief planes to Aweil and nearby
el-Obeid. Organizers of both say they will continue as long as
security permits.
   Western diplomats said a de facto cease-fire has existed since
rebels led by former Col. John Garang and the Democratic Unionist
Party, a junior partner in Sudan's governing coalition, signed an
interim peace agreement last month.
   Relief workers said many of the hundreds of thousands who fled to
Aweil and other towns during the rainy season, when Garang and his
Sudan People's Liberation Army take the offensive, returned home
after the rains ended in October.
   ``But now only half ... are physically capable of cultivating the
land,'' a U.N. official said, on condition of anonymity. ``That
means only half the amount of food needed will be available. They
will eat it and then come to the towns, and when the rainy season
starts next June another tragedy will happen.''
   An average of 62 people died each day in Wau at the peak of
famine, and about 8,000 are believed to have died in Aweil.
Thousands more perished in Muglad, Abyei and other towns in the
strip that divides Sudan's north and south.
   Detlef Palm of UNICEF said: ``The tragedy is over for the moment.
We made a quick survey. We asked families how many children they had
lost and they would usually point to little mounds or graves near
their huts and say one or two or three or all of them died.''
   Palm, one of the group visiting Aweil last week, said a measles
epidemic in June killed many children and half those remaining
suffer from malnutrition in varying degrees.
   ``We can only fly one ton on each flight,'' he said. ``Aweil
desperately needs bulk food and that can only go by train.''
   He and other U.N. oficials said a 30-car train with 900 tons of
food was being delayed in Babanousa, 125 miles from Aweil, because
of the danger.
   They said the short trip would take four weeks because the tracks
were in poor condition and constant checks had to be made for
ambushes or mines. The last train reached Aweil in March, three
months before the rains.
   Predictions for 1989 are gloomy. One U.N. official said: ``No
matter when the peace agreement will be signed, we anticipate the
same disaster next year.
   ``It's a cycle that has happened for hundreds of years, but
before the war people stockpiled the food in the villages. Now the
situation is aggravated by the displaced people and the war makes
transport of food more difficult.''
   Palm said Aweil, with 30,000 local residents and 60,000 refugees
expekcted next spring, needs 11,000 tons of food to last through the
rainy season but ``it will be impossible to deliver.''
   Another U.N. official said Aweil will need up to 28,000 tons more
than it gets next year, and ``the situation in the rest of the south
must be equally as bad. Even if peace is restored, it won't feed the
people.''
   ``The south will remain an area with a high food deficit for
years,'' he said. ``Peace might only make the transportation of food
easier.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People should not take comfort in this year's
apparently improved ozone levels over Antarctica, a climate expert
warned Tuesday.
   ``This year there is a substantial recovery'' in Antarctic ozone
levels, Dr. Robert Watson of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration told the opening session of the Second North American
Conference on Preparing for Climate Change.
   But despite the improvement, there is no reason to believe the
manmade chemicals are not destroying ozone in the atmosphere, he
said. Damage to that layer could increase again next year or the
year after, said Watson.
   Ozone high in the atmosphere blocks some of the sun's ultraviolet
radiation, and scientists fear that a reduction in that protective
screen could lead to more skin cancer, eye damage and other problems.
   Depleted ozone levels over Antarctica have been widely referred
to as a ``hole'' in the Earth's ozone layer, and some concern has
also been expressed over whether the problem has spread to the
Arctic.
   Changes in clouds, temperature, winds and other weather factors
could account for the improvement this year, but that doesn't mean
there will be a permanent improvement, said Watson, who is preparing
for a research effort to investigate ozone levels at the North Pole.
   Ozone levels over the Antarctic in September and October were
about 22 percent below that measured in 1979, Watson said. By
contrast, last year the level was 50 percent of the 1979 level.
   Such low ozone levels will not spread around the globe, Watson
said, but populated areas could see a slight decline in the ozone
overhead, and that would mean health dangers.
   Governments are likely to further restrict release of chemicals
that damage the ozone, however, thus easing the long-term damage, he
said.
   The question is not whether there will be an international
agreement to extend the limits reached previously at Montreal, only
when a new agreement will be made, said Watson.
   The ozone hole was first reported in the early 1980s by British
researchers. It occurs within a vortex of west to east winds which
circle the South Pole in the winter and spring months _ equivalent
to the summer and fall months in the Northern Hemisphere.
   Watson noted that this year the area of reduced ozone, while
smaller than in the last couple of seasons, has shifted somewhat.
   Instead of being near the South Pole, the area has moved toward
South America, he commented, with the region of Antarctica closer to
Australia having near normal ozone levels.
   Of particular importance may be the reduction in the amount of
high level clouds in the polar regions, Watson said. Those clouds
provide ice surfaces which promote the chemical reactions in which
chlorine and bromine compounds damage or destroy molecules of ozone,
scientists report.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A public outcry grew over a
just-disclosed nuclear accident that occurred a year ago in West
Germany, and officials acknowledged Tuesday that human errors were
involved.
   Hesse Environment Minister Karlheinz Weimar alleged a utility
company initially gave authorities a ``visibly wrong description of
the facts'' of the accident, a charge the semi-private
Rhine-Westfalia Electrical Company denies. Nobody was hurt when a
small amount of radioactive steam was released into the atmosphere
Dec. 16-17, 1987, at the Biblis reactor.
   But environmentalists charge technical and human errors could
have caused a serious nuclear accident at the plant, located in the
heavily populated Rhine River valley about 30 miles south of
Frankfurt.
   Weimar conceded he was mistaken to withhold details from the
public.
   ``In hindsight it is completely clear that it would have been
better if I had decided differently,'' he told reporters.
   He also alleged without elaboration that the utility company
initially ``resisted evaluations of the incident by authorities.''
   But the company insists it reported the incident in line with
federal and state regulations.
   Hesse state and federal officials have said they initially
believed the accident was less serious, but also insist there never
was any danger. Independent atomic energy observers agree.
   The accident was revealed by Inside NRC, an American biweekly
industry newsletter about nuclear safety.
   ``It is scandalous that the populace learns of this only a year
later through an American newsletter,'' said Ernst Welteke, head of
the Social Democratic Party in Hesse.
   West Germans have been sensitive about nuclear energy since the
1986 Chernobyl disaster released radioactivity in much of central
Europe.
   Social Democrats have demanded officials close the 1,200-megawatt
reactor at Biblis and environmentalists have increased calls for the
country to abandon nuclear power.
   Nuclear plants provide 35 percent of West Germany's power.
   A spokesman for Darmstadt's Oeko-Institute environmental research
organization drew parallels with human errors at the 1979 Three Mile
Island accident in Middletown, Pa.
   ``For 15 hours they (Biblis operators) didn't recognize an alarm
in the control room signalling that the position of a valve was not
correct. The same kind of thing happened at Three Mile Island,''
said Lothar Hahn.
   Atomic energy officials say plant operators either did not notice
the light for 15 hours or did not believe there was a malfunction.
   They also say reactor operators were wrong wrong to open a second
valve for a few seconds to try to close the malfunctioning one.
   The newsletter said opening the second valve allowed a small
amount of radioactive steam to escape into the atmosphere.
   Horst May, a spokesman for the Reactor Safety Institute, said
with the extra pressure on the second valve ``there would have been
danger that the pipes could break which might have meant a loss of
coolant.'' But he added the reactor has several emergency backup
systems to prevent this.
   Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer said as a result of the Biblis
incident nuclear reactors across the country have been outfitted
with equipment to avoid such accidents and work crews have received
new training.

<HEAD>Cranberry Cooperative Wants To Change Plea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc. will plead guilty to
federal charges that it intentionally dumped hazardous waste into
sewers near its fruit-processing plant in an eastern Massachusetts
town, authorities said Tuesday.
   Ocean Spray, which pleaded innocent to the charges in February,
has asked for a change of plea hearing Dec. 20 before U.S. District
Judge David Nelson.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard E. Welch 3rd said Tuesday the
only possible plea change is to guilty, and ``there will be pleas of
guilty to negligent and willful charges.''
   The cranberry cooperative declined comment on the settlement.
   Ocean Spray could be fined $2.1 million if convicted of the six
felony and 72 misdemeanor charges that allege it discharged
cranberry peelings and acids into municipal sewers and the Nemasket
River from 1983 to 1987 despite being fined by Middleboro, a town 35
miles south of Boston.
   The case was the first in which the government charged a company
with a felony under the Clean Water Act.
   Despite the plea change, the possibility remains that some of the
charges could be dropped, including the felonies, federal
prosecutors said.
   Ocean Spray spokesman John M. Lawlor said the company would have
no further comment on the case until it is settled.
   ``We are working on a solution that is in the best interests of
our company, our grower-owners and the Middleboro community,'' Ocean
Spray President and Chief Executive Officer John S. Llewellyn Jr.
said in a statement Monday.
   ``The negotiations are still in progress so it's premature to
disclose any specifics now,'' he said.
   Middleboro Town Manager John Healey said town officials have been
working with Ocean Spray since the indictment was issued Jan. 28.
   Ocean Spray, a $781 million cooperative, employs 400 people full
time and up to 575 people part time in the town of 20,000.
   On the day it was indicted, Ocean Spray said it never endangered
the public's health or the environment.
   U.S. Environmental Protection Agency officials had described the
indictment as a test case of the Clean Water Act.
   ``It took them about six months to come to the conclusion that
they had done something in fact that was a violation of the Clean
Water Act and they had to do something to correct that,'' Healey
said.
   The indictment charged that Ocean Spray, almost daily since 1976,
dumped up to 200,000 gallons of poorly treated, excessively acidic
waste water into the Nemasket River and Middleboro's sewer system.
   Ocean Spray said Monday it has spent $3.2 million since 1986 to
improve and clean up its operations in Middleboro.

   Confessed TWA hijacker Mohammed
Ali Hamadi showed kindness to several hostages during the ordeal, a
flight attendant from the jetliner testified Tuesday.
   Flight attendant Helen Sheehan also said some crew members gave
misleading accounts of the hijacking to the news media after their
release.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, was charged with murder and air
piracy in the June 1985 hijacking. Thirty-nine Americans were held
hostage for 17 days, and U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was killed
during the ordeal.
   Hamadi has admitted he and an accomplice hijacked the
Athens-to-Rome flight, but has denied killing Stethem, of Waldorf,
Md.
   Mrs. Sheehan said the crew of the hijacked airliner met in
September 1985 to discuss the hijacking and agreed that Hamadi's
accomplice was the leader of the operation and that he, not Hamadi,
might have shot Stethem.
   Hamadi's accomplice, identified in court documents as Hassan
Ezzeddine, is a fugitive. Witnesses at the trial have testified that
he used the name ``Said'' during the hijacking.
   ``The consensus of opinion at the time was that it was Said who
was in charge about the aircraft and while we discussed that nobody
saw who murdered Mr. Stethem, we did feel that Said might have been
the one who could have done it,'' Mrs. Sheehan said, referring to
the meeting of the crew at TWA headquarters in New York.
   Pilot John Testrake testified earlier that he believed Hamadi
pulled the trigger, and co-pilot Philip Maresca testified he saw
Hamadi with a gun seconds after Stethem was shot.
   Mrs. Sheehan, 45, said Hamadi was carrying a gun before Stethem's
murder, but that after she heard a shot, she saw Said with a pistol.
   She also said Hamadi sometimes acted with kindness to the
hostages.
   ``Mr. Hamadi personally gave a glass of water to Clinton Suggs,''
a U.S. Navy diver, said Mrs. Sheehan, who has U.S. and British
citizenship and still works for the airline.
   ``Mr. Hamadi also personally served a meal to Kurt Carlson,''
said Mrs. Sheehan. Carlson was one of the Americans severely beaten
by the hijackers. Mrs. Sheehan said she was aware of the beatings
but did not witness them.
   ``When I saw Mr. Stethem for the first time it was apparent to me
that he had internal injuries because he had trouble breathing and
had difficulty walking,'' she said.
   Mrs. Sheehan said she disagreed strongly with statements made by
other crew members after their release.
   ``There were so many different reports that I thought I myself
was at a different hijacking,'' she told the court, without giving
any specifics.
   She criticized a U.S. television movie based on the hijacking,
saying: ``Mr. Hamadi was clearly shown as being the killer of Mr.
Stethem. In my estimation, that was putting someone on trial without
giving them due process.''
   Mrs. Sheehan also criticized TWA management and FBI agents for
the way they handled events immediately after the hostages were
released.
   ``We were returned to New York and we walked into a circus
atmosphere,'' she said.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt Airport in 1987 after customs
officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.

   The president has ordered an
investigation into the deaths of 60 students who jumped from windows
or were trampled after hearing rumors their school would collapse,
Radio Cameroon reported Tuesday.
   About 70 students remained hospitalized after the incident
Monday, including several in critical condition, according to
medical sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Hospital officials said an estimated 60 children between the ages
of 12 and 15 died at the Institut Jean Monthe, a private school in
the capital.
   The school, which was still under construction, was being built
by the students.
   At the time of the accident, there were an estimated 10,000
students in the five-story building that had only one stairway and a
single exit, the French news agency Agence France-Presse reported.
   Radio Cameroon reported that a fight between a teacher and some
students was misunderstood as warning that the building was about to
crumble.
   As the panic spread, students rushed down the staircase toward
the exit. Some were trampled to death or pushed from the staircase,
others jumped from the windows on the upper floors.

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Soviet officials today offered
different previews of Wednesday's meeting between the superpowers'
leaders, with the Americans trying to dampen expectations raised by
the Soviet promise of a ``Christmas gift to the American people and
mankind.''
   ``We have a president who is leaving office in a few weeks, who
is not going to be making any promises that he is not here to
keep,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``And we have a new president who will be taking office in a few
weeks, who is not going to be making commitments when he doesn't
have an administration in power that can fully analyze and make
these judgments,'' he said.
   Fitzwater commented as both sides prepared for the meeting of
President Reagan and President-elect George Bush with Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Wednesday in New York City.
   The session will be held after Gorbachev addresses the U.N.
General Assembly. Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze will meet in the morning at
the U.S. mission to the United Nations.
   Gorbachev, arriving in New York today from Moscow, did not
discuss any specifics, but said there was no agenda for his meeting
with Reagan and Bush.
   ``I believe that we can safely say even now that the
conversations and the meeting itself will doubtless promote greater
dynamism in the dialogue and relations between our two countries,''
Gorbachev said.
   But he is expected to make wide-ranging proposals to the General
Assembly and possibly in his meeting with Reagan and Bush.
   A top Soviet Communist Party official, Nikolai Shishlin, said
Sunday that Gorbachev would have ``a Christmas gift to the American
people and to mankind'' on his visit to New York.
   An American official today acknowledged the possibility of a
``grand gesture,'' such as a reduction of Soviet troops in
Czechoslovakia and Hungary. ``It is plausible they would do it on
the eve of the opening of negotiations with the West and also as a
public relations move,'' said the official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Such a move, in the absence of a similar move by the United
States, would reduce the Soviet advantage in conventional forces in
Europe and could facilitate an overall conventional force agreement
early in the Bush administration.
   The U.S. official told The Associated Press that the Soviets gave
no formal notification in advance of Gorbachev's visit of a troop
reduction. ``However,'' the official said, ``it is certainly on our
list of expectations.''
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact are
expected to open talks on reducing troops, tanks and other
non-nuclear forces early next year.
   The Reagan administration, however, continued to play down the
event.
   Fitzwater said that while Gorbachev could spring a surprise, it
would not be ``embarrassing'' if the meeting concluded without a
breakthrough or an agreement.
   Fitzwater also suggested that U.S. officials would not let
Gorbachev put them under pressure to respond immediately to some new
initiative.
   ``We are being very realistic,'' Fitzwater said. ``We find
nothing embarrassing or in any way negative about characterizing
this meeting as a friendly discussion, an open airing of issues
between us and a healthy approach towards continuity.''
   He said that simply by meeting, the U.S. and Soviet officials
illustrate ``the strength of the new relationship'' between
Washington and Moscow.
   Bush, meanwhile, insisted that he would participate in the
luncheon only as vice president. But, he added: ``I expect they'll
be aware they're talking to the next president.''
   Echoing that line, Senate Minority leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said
Reagan is ``going to be in charge until the 20th of January. George
Bush understands that, Gorbachev understands that. But (Gorbachev)
also knows that's not very far away.''
   Under diplomatic protocol, though, Bush will be at the meeting as
Reagan's understudy, not as president-elect. Colin Powell, the White
House national security adviser, said that given Bush's position,
``it would not be appropriate, then, for the vice president to have
a separate agenda.''
   Asked about the Soviet report likening Gorbachev's planned
proposals to a Christmas present, Bush joked: ``We're not going to
open it before Christmas.''
   More seriously, he said, ``We'll consider whatever it is he has
to say. And, no, certainly there'll be some talk of substance at the
meeting.''
   The New York Times reported today that a cable from the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow advised officials in Washington to expect
proposals from Gorbachev to lower American limits on trade and
lending with communist countries.
   It said the proposals could include greater access to American
stock and financial markets, as well as fewer limits on the ability
of organizations such as the Export-Import Bank and World Bank to
underwrite loans to the Soviet Union.
   Bush, meanwhile, said he has ``made very clear to the leaders in
the Soviet Union that I am most anxious to continue to seek ways to
work together and to have progress.''
   ``But I have not assembled my national security team in toto,''
he added. ``There will not be any commitment on my part in terms of
specific arms control proposals or things of that nature. We'll
listen, make clear we want progress _ it's of interest to America
and everybody around the world in my view _ but not start moving
forward in detail on strategic arms, conventional force arms deals
or anything else.''
   Bush will not be accompanied by his own national security
adviser-designate, Brent Scowcroft. Moreover, Bush is not planning
to give his own public interpretation of the meeting, leaving that
to Shultz and Reagan.
   Shultz will give reporters a summary of the luncheon meeting
Wednesday afternoon and then fly to Brussels to brief foreign
ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Reagan,
meanwhile, will give a speech in Washington on Wednesday night to
the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group.

   An unwed California father lost the last chance
to legally restore parental ties with his 7-year-old daughter
Tuesday, eight days after his case was argued before the Supreme
Court.
   The nation's highest court dashed Edward McNamara's hopes in a
one-sentence decision: ``The appeal is dismissed for want of a
properly presented federal question.''
   There was no recorded dissent.
   In his appeal, McNamara contended that his parental rights had
been terminaife.
   In arguments before the justices Nov. 28, McNamara's lawyer
contended that California law unfairly discriminated against
McNamara by making it more difficult for him to assert his rights as
a parent.
   San Diego County had defended the state's policy of giving an
unwed mother the primary right to decide whether to surrender a
child for adoption.
   The county also had argued that McNamara waited too long to
assert his rights.
   McNamara's lawyer, James E. Sutherland, said he felt
``disappointment and frustration for my client, who's been told by
all the California courts that he should have won this in the first
place, but because the county got possession of his daughter and
placed her with adoptive parents, it was not in a position to be
corrected.''
   ``It seems to be an issue which has grasped the imagination of a
lot of the public,'' Sutherland said. ``It would have been nice to
get a resolution on the merits of the case.''
   As for McNamara's hopes of visitation, the lawyer said: ``There's
nothing more legally we can do. The trial court recommended that he
be part of Katie's extended family, but there hasn't been any
accommodation. He still hasn't seen her.''
   On the grounds for dismissal, Sutherland said he was surprised
because a state appeals court had refused to consider the federal
constitutional issues, ruling that the California Supreme Court had
addressed those issues and upheld the state law.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrived today
for meetings with President Reagan and U.N. leaders, pledging to do
his part toward easing tensions in ``a world that is going through
some very crucial changes.''
   Gorbachev is expected to put a moderate face on Soviet foreign
policy and show himself eager to achieve progress with the new U.S.
administration. He was expected to offer wide-ranging proposals on
arms control and other issues, including cuts in Warsaw Pact forces,
sources said.
   The plane carrying Gorbachev, his wife, Raisa, and three top
Soviet foreign policy advisers touched down at John F. Kennedy
International Airport shortly before 3 p.m.
   Gorbachev, dressed in gray overcoat and hat, exited the Aeroflot
plane with his wife after the 10-hour flight and walked down to the
tarmac, where they were welcomed by Aly I. Teymour, the United
Nations' chief of protocol. Also on hand was U.S. Chief of Protocol
Selwa Roosevelt.
   Addressing the crowd, Gorbachev said: ``We are living in a world
that is going through some very crucial changes and we all, all
nations, have their own concerns and interests. We shall be sharing
our concerns and interests in thinking over the current situation.''
   ``I believe that we can safely say even now that the
conversations and the meeting itself will doubtless promote greater
dynamism in the dialogue and relations between our two countries,''
he added.
   The Soviet leader said he expected to meet with American business
leaders and officials of other countries and that he hoped these
will be ``useful and fruitful days. We are certainly prepared to
make our contribution toward that end.''
   Gorbachev spoke in Russian, with the English translation read by
Viktor Sukhudreyev, a Soviet Foreign Ministry official who has
translated at U.S.-Soviet summits for two decades.
   Gorbachev was accompanied to New York by Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze and Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev, and by
Deputy Premier Vladimir Kamentsev, according to the official Tass
news agency. Yuri Dubinin, the Soviet Ambassador to Washington and
his predecessor, Anatoly Dobrynin, who is now a foreign policy
adviser to Gorbachev, also were on hand at the airport.
   There was advance word that the Soviet leader may offer new
proposals to ease superpower tensions, strengthen the United Nations
and improve the world's environment.
   A U.S. official acknowledged the possibility of a ``grand
gesture,'' such as a reduction of Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia
and Hungary. ``It is plausible they would do it on the eve of the
opening of negotiations with the West and also as a public relations
move,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The official told The Associated Press that the Soviets gave no
formal notification in advance of Gorbachev's visit of a troop
reduction. ``However,'' the official said, ``it is certainly on our
list of expectations.''
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact are
expected to open talks on reducing troops, tanks and other
non-nuclear forces early next year.
   A motorcade of some 45 limousines, including Soviet diplomats,
U.N. officials and security officers, headed for Manhattan, giving
the city the first taste of the traffic tie-ups expected during the
Gorbachevs' three-day stay. It was the first visit by a Soviet
leader to New York since Nikita Khrushchev's 1960 trip.
   The Gorbachevs are staying at the Soviet Mission to the U.N., a
16-mile trip from the airport.
   On Wednesday, the Soviet leader addresses the United Nations and
meets with Reagan and President-elect George Bush. After a day of
sightseeing in Manhattan, he travels to Cuba and Great Britain.
   In a dispatch by a diplomatic correspondent distributed shortly
after Gorbachev's departure, Tass said Gorbachev intends to discuss
the entire range of U.S.-Soviet issues with Reagan and Bush.
   ``The Soviet leadership intends to talk about important
substantive matters concerning real political cooperation between
the two countries on the broadest range of problems, including the
state of affairs and prospects for further headway in the fields of
arms limitation and reduction, human rights, a settlement of
regional conflicts, and the development of bilateral relations,''
   It said Gorbachev's decision to address the United Nations was a
sign of Soviet regard for the world body as an ``indispensable
mechanism in the quest for a peaceful solution to international
issues, for resolution of crisis situations, and for settlement of
other global problems.''
   In several reports Monday, official media emphasized the new
style of Soviet diplomacy and the need for speedy progress on arms
control issues when Bush takes office in January.
   In a front-page report from New York, the government newspaper
Izvestia pointedly told its readers that Gorbachev's behavior at the
U.N. will differ markedly from Khrushchev's shoe-thumping in 1960.
   Izvestia, without naming Khrushchev, recalled ``how our leader
looked then in the hall of the General Assembly, how he jumped up
from place, trying to interrupt speakers he didn't like, pounded his
fist on the table (and not only his fist).''
   But it was the need for more progress on arms control that Tass
stressed. It sounded an optimistic note, saying four summits between
Gorbachev and Reagan leading to a treaty signed a year ago
eliminating medium and shorter-range nuclear missiles had built a
``strong and solid'' foundation for U.S.-Soviet relations.
   It said there certainly would be future problems, but expressed
confidence the two sides could work through them.
   ``It is perfectly natural that the new administration will need
some time to get its bearings in the complexity of domestic and
international problems. But it is very important not to drag out
this period. Marking time in international affairs, especially in
the domain of arms limitation and reduction, is tantamount not only
to loss of time, but to backsliding,'' Tass said.
   New York police said the Gorbachevs would visit the Observation
Deck of the World Trade Center on Wednesday and drive past the Stock
Exchange and through the Broadway area. Opening a Soviet export
show, viewing European paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art
and visiting Central Park were on the schedule Thursday.
   Police said Mrs. Gorbachev might also visit a department store
Wednesday.
   During his trip, the Soviet leader will try to end Soviet Union's
``enemy image'' because the Kremlin needs to divert resources from
the military and foreign aid to solve stubborn internal problems,
Soviet sources in Moscow said.
   Gorbachev will also try to persuade Fidel Castro in Cuba, the
costly Soviet client where he is to arrive Friday, that it is time
to de-emphasize his penchant for revolutions, the sources said.
   Western diplomats in Moscow say the Soviet Union does not have
the resources to continue spending at its current rate on its own
military and on aid to client countries such as Cuba.
   Gorbachev has said he wants to lessen East-West tension to divert
some resources from the military to improving food, clothing and
consumer goods for Soviet citizens.

   The much-discussed ``greenhouse effect''
causing global warming is no more ``just a theory'' than gravity, a
pioneer researcher in the field said Tuesday.
   And the fact that global average temperatures have dropped
sharply in the second half of 1988 should not be taken as evidence
that the world is cooling off or not warming up, he and a colleague
agreed.
   ``The greenhouse effect is not at all a controversial subject''
among scientists, said Stephen Schneider of the National Center for
Atmospheric Research at Boulder, Colo., in a speech to a conference
sponsored by the non-profit Climate Institute.
   The warming, the result of a build-up of heat-trapping gases in
the atmosphere that act like the transparent glass ceiling of a
greenhouse, would result in rising sea levels, stronger hurricanes,
drastic shifts in rainfall, the northward migration of agricultural
zones and more frequent droughts, according to computer models.
   One widely accepted prediction says the warming will amount to
about three to eight degrees Fahrenheit by sometime in the middle of
next century.
   James Hansen, a climatologist at the Goddard Institute of Space
Sciences, a New York City-based arm of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, said a sharp cooling of the southern Pacific
Ocean probably will mean the 1988 average global temperature will
not set a record, but will match or be slightly below the two
warmest years on record, 1981 and 1987, which were virtual ties.
   ``If you want to see if there's a greenhouse effect, you don't
look just at 1988 or 1984 or any particular year, but the entire
1980s,'' Hansen said at a news conference.
   Even if 1988 does not set a record, it will still be one of the
five warmest years known to history _ all in the 1980s.
   Some experts have said the cooling in the southern Pacific could
presage a 30-year cooling trend. Schneider said he sees nothing to
support such a prediction.
   The chief gas responsible for the greenhouse effect is carbon
dioxide produced by the burning of fossil fuels. Concentrations in
the atmosphere have risen 25 percent in the past 200 years and more
than 10 percent in the past 30 years.
   Some industrial spokesmen and government officials have argued
that the warming that scientists like Schneider have predicted is
only a theory that hasn't been proven.
   But Schneider defended the accuracy of computer models, and said
the only unsolved questions are how much warmer the Earth will
become and ``whether it's going to happen in 50 or 100 years.''
   Schneider said, ``To people who say it's only a theory, I like to
say, `OK, gravity is only a theory. Please stick your neck in the
guillotine and let's conduct today's experiment.'''
   He urged support for energy conservation and other measures he
said would be ``already justified ... even if the entire problem
turns out to be fake.''
   Hansen attracted wide attention with Senate testimony in July
that the greenhouse warming had begun, though he cautioned that last
summer's heat wave in the United States could be normal climate
variation. At the time, he said there was a possibility 1988 could
be the warmest year in history.

   The Kremlin lashed out again Tuesday at officials
in the republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan for their handling of an
ethnic dispute in which at least three more people have been killed
and six others injured.
   The Communist Party's Central Committee and Council of Ministers,
or Cabinet, passed a resolution saying local officials were partly
responsible for a mass exodus and eviction of Armenians and
Azerbaijanis from their homes.
   More than 180,000 people have crossed the border of the two
southern republics, and the resolution said ``extremist groups''
were not the only ones to blame.
   ``These actions are taking place with the connivance and
frequently with the direct involvement of individual local party,
government and economic officials,'' the official news agency Tass
quoted the resolution as saying.
   The resolution demanded local authorities take ``immediate and
decisive measures'' to stop the abuses.
   The evening news program ``Vremya'' on Tuesday showed refugees
arriving with truckloads of their belongings in Azerbaijan, and a
train arriving in the Armenian capital of Yerevan with other
refugees. A correspondent said one Armenian family took in two
families who had fled Azerbaijan because of the fear of violence.
   The new deaths, reported by Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman
Vadim Perfiliev, raised the death toll in the last three weeks to at
least 31. More than 180,000 people have fled their homes and crossed
the border of the two southern republics.
   Official media reports also said there were an undetermined
number of new deaths in Armenia, but gave no details.
   ``Three people were killed (in Azerbaijan), but not as a result
of clashes with law enforcement agencies,'' Perfiliev told a news
briefing. He said soldiers had fired shots, but only in warning.
   ``Six people were wounded, including three servicemen,''
Perfiliev added. He did not elaborate.
   The newspaper Socialist Industry said Tuesday that curfews had
been imposed in 14 new regions of Armenia, where ethnic tension has
increased between mixed Armenian and Azerbaijani populations.
   ``In regions of the republic the situation is extraordinarily
dangerous,'' the newspaper said. ``There have been deaths in the
Kalinin, Masis and Gugark region.''
   An editor at the official Armenian news agency Armenpress,
speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed there had been new
deaths in the three northern regions but said he did not know how
many or have any further details.
   Unrest has persisted despite a number of measures taken by the
Kremlin to contain it. On Monday, the Kremlin warned Communist Party
officials and economic managers it would fire and prosecute them if
they were involved in dismissing workers for ethnic reasons.
   Both sides in the dispute have accused the other of firing
workers because of their ethnic background and depriving families of
food and medical supplies.
   Last week, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev gathered Armenian and
Azerbaijani officials and demanded an end to the ethnic strife.
   Officials also have imposed curfews and announced a program of
assistance to the refugees. Many cities, including Yerevan and the
Azerbaijani capital of Baku, remain under military law and a strict
curfew.
   State-run Baku radio said three soldiers and a medical student
were wounded in clashes with gangs in Baku on Monday.
   ``Extremists and criminal elements provoked disorders on massive
scales and attempted to commit acts of looting and other illegal
actions'' in Baku, it said.
   Sources in Yerevan reported that city quiet under a 11 p.m.-5
a.m. curfew.
   The ethnic dispute broke out in February when the predominantly
Armenian population of Azerbaijan's Nagorno-Karabakh region began
agitating for annexation by Armenia.
   Thousands of people began demonstrating in Armenia in support of
the demand. Demontrations opposing it were staged in Azerbaijan.
   Ethnic rioting broke out in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait at
the end of February, and at least 26 Armenians and six Azerbaijanis
were killed.

   The State Department on Tuesday distanced
itself from the meeting in Stockholm between American Jews and
Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat, but a
department spokesman said the government will be represented at a
special United Nations meeting in Geneva.
   ``We're not a part ... of those contacts,'' department spokesman
Charles Redman said, discussing the meeting of the five-member
Jewish delegation from the United States.
   Redman declined comment when asked whether the government was
informed in advance about the meeting, arranged by Swedish Foreign
Minister Sten Anderssen.
   Redman also would not comment on reports that the Egyptian
government is trying to persuade Arafat to comply with U.S. demands
for more explicit recognition of the state of Israel than contained
in the recent PLO declaration at Algiers.
   Arafat will be speaking at a special U.N. Assembly session that
was moved to Geneva after the United States refused, on grounds of
his terrorist connections, to give Arafat an entry visa to address
the assembly in New York.
   Despite the furor over the visa denial, the United States
continues to be interested and active in pursuing peace in the
Middle East, Redman said.
   The ``peace process ... will continue to be a top priority
item,'' he declared.
   ``Despite all this turmoil on the question of the visa, that
nonetheless has nothing to do with our regard for the Palestinian
issue, and so we believe that the debate in Geneva will be an
important one, and we'll be there,'' he said.

   The parliament of the tiny Baltic
republic of Estonia exercised its newly declared sovereignty for the
first time Tuesday by banning further industrial development in an
ecologically devastated area.
   The action puts Estonia, with a population of 1.6 million people,
on a collision course with Moscow ministries.
   Estonia's Supreme Soviet, or parliament, declared sovereignty
Nov. 16 over all its internal affairs. The Presidium, or executive
council of the national parliament, promptly deemed the action
illegal, but the Estonians have refused to abide by that order,
saying their own constitutional amendments take precedence over
Presidium decrees.
   An Estonian constitutional amendment gave the republic's
parliament the power to veto Soviet laws, but Estonian officials
have used the measure cautiously.
   On Tuesday, they postponed plans to override two controversial
nationwide decrees limiting demonstrations and dissent, deciding to
ignore the decrees and instead to enforce only a more liberal
Estonian law on the same subject passed in January.
   The parliamentary decision to crack down on pollution was a
response to public anger over the worst of the Moscow ministries'
excesses.
   ``Life lately has shown the ministries don't have the desire to
go to court over matters of environmental protection,'' Estonian
Prime Minister Indrek Toome said in explaining why Estonia's
government was stepping in.
   Supreme Soviet deputy Endel Lippmaa said the new environmental
protection law could not have been passed without the powers
contained in the Nov. 16 Estonian constitutional amendment.
   The law bans expansion of mining or other polluting industries in
northeastern Estonia, which has suffered environmental damage from
mining and pollution from power plants, said Lippmaa and fellow
representative Juhan Aare.
   Aare, leader of an environmental group called the Estonian Greens
movement, said the new law also orders the Estonian Council of
Ministers to write a detailed environmental cleanup plan by Nov. 1,
1989.
   The law puts the Estonian government in conflict with the Moscow
ministries that run the Tallinn paper mill, the Viru power plant and
the Maardu chemical factory, Lippmaa said. Estonian officials have
tried for years to persuade the bureaucrats to reduce air and water
pollution from these facilities.
   Estonia has severe sulfur dioxide and dust pollution and a wide
variey of chemicals in its groundwater, Lippmaa said. Aare said
scientists calculated that Soviet plans to open another mine would
destroy the drinking water supply in most of Estonia.
   The law was passed unanimously after heated debate in which
lawmakers considered but finally rejected the immediate closure of
several factories.
   The Kremlin has shown itself willing to listen to local calls for
environmental protection since the 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant. In recent months, it has canceled controversial
water projects, including a plan to divert the Dnieper River in the
eastern Ukraine.
   The Estonian Supreme Soviet is to vote Wednesday on a proposal to
make Estonian an official language of the republic. It will also
vote on another measure to define the arrest and deportation of tens
of thousands of Estonians during the 1940s and 1950s as ``crimes
against humanity.''

   Five nations in sub-Saharan Africa face
famine next year, although increased rain and abundant harvests in
1988 have improved the food outlook in most other countries, a U.N.
agency said Tuesday.
   Sudan, Angola, Ethiopia, Malawi and Mozambique face critical food
shortages due to civil strife or large numbers of refugees,
according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization.
   The Rome-based agency said the grain harvest in Ethiopia appears
to be good, but that civil war continues to impede distribution of
food to areas affected by last year's severe drought.
   Grain harvests also appear good in northern Sudan, the agency
said, but ``further deaths from starvation appear inevitable'' in
the southern part of the country, where civil strife has interfered
with relief efforts.
   Western agencies estimate 260,000 people have died this year in
southern Sudan because of drought and the refusal of the government
or the rebels to permit distribution of emergency food supplies.
   The International Red Cross and U.N.-sponsored agencies began an
airlift of food to towns in the southern Sudan on Monday. It was the
first time in the 5-year-old war that both sides assured the
agencies that planes carrying aid would not be fired upon.

<HEAD>NBC Stretches Streak to 24 in a Row as `Cosby' Resumes Top Spot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite a lot of season premieres last week, a
repeat of ``The Cosby Show'' was back at the top of the A.C. Nielsen
Co. rankings after dropping to No. 10 on Thanksgiving.
   NBC won the week as usual, but ABC grabbed second place with help
from a No. 2-rated Barbara Walters special.
   The top-rated prime-time shows of the week were: ``The Cosby
Show,'' NBC; ``The 50th Barbara Walters Special,'' ABC; ``A
Different World,'' NBC; ``Cheers,'' NBC; ``Golden Girls,'' NBC;
``Roseanne,'' ABC; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS; ``Who's the Boss?'' ABC;
``Murder, She Wrote,'' CBS and ``Growing Pains,'' ABC.
   NBC stretched its streak to 24 weeks in a row, winning the week
ending Dec. 4 with an average, prime-time rating of 16.0. ABC was
second with a 13.4. CBS had a 12.2.
   ABC's ``Roseanne'' continued to be the highest-rated new show of
the season. Next-highest were NBC's ``Empty Nest'' and ``Dear
John,'' ranked 12th and 13th respectively.
   NBC also made the top 20 with the two-hour preview movie of ``In
the Heat of the Night'' at 17th.
   ABC resumed its high-rated Wednesday lineup with the season
premieres of ``The Wonder Years,'' at 24th, ``Hooperman'' at 33rd
and ``China Beach'' at 37th.
   NBC's ``Unsolved Mysteries'' and ``Night Court'' fared reasonably
well on Wednesday, but ``Baby Boom'' dropped to 48th in the
rankings, and ``Tattinger's'' was 60th.
   CBS was an also-ran on Wednesday. Its back-to-back Mary Tyler
Moore and Dick Van Dyke comedies were near the bottom of the
rankings. CBS bounced back a little with a theatrical film, Tom
Selleck in ``Runaway,'' at 41st.
   CBS' new ``TV101'' had an inauspicious ratings debut Tuesday at
63rd, just below ABC's new George Segal vehicle on Saturday,
``Murphy's Law.'' CBS did better with Monday night's ``Almost
Grown,'' which ranked 44th.
   The sore spot for NBC is Friday night where CBS' ``Beauty and the
Beast,'' ``Dallas'' and ``Falcon Crest'' still prevail.
   ``NBC Nightly News'' won Thanksgiving week, its first win in over
a year, but dropped back to third in a close race among the news
broadcasts. ``CBS Evening News'' was first with a rating of 11.5 and
a 21 share. ``ABC World News Tonight'' had an 11.3 and 20 share. NBC
had a 10.7 and 20.
   Each rating point represents 904,000 households with television.
The share is a percentage of sets in use.
   The lowest-rated network shows of the week were: ``West 57th''
tied with ``TV 101,'' ``Dirty Dancing,'' ``Knightwatch,'' ``The Van
Dyke Show,'' ``Police Story,'' ``Burning Questions: Defense,''
``Trackdown,'' ``Annie McGuire,'' ``Simon & Simon'' and ``Raising
Miranda.''

   More than 90 top U.S. drug middlemen were indicted
Tuesday based on evidence from a sting operation in which an
undercover FBI company sold traffickers radios, navigational beacons
and other high-tech equipment.
   Tapes and other evidence from the operation led to drug
indictments in Miami and Tampa against 93 people. About five tons of
cocaine, 100 tons of marijuana and some heroin also was confiscated,
FBI Director Williams Sessions announced in Washington.
   ``We believe that this case, because of the positions and large
numbers of those charged and arrested, will have a significant
impact on the ability of these cartels to continue to import drugs
into the United States and abroad,'' the FBI director said.
   By Tuesday afternoon about half of those charged were in custody
in various cities around the country, including Los Angeles, Boston,
Houston, Tampa and Miami, the FBI said.
   The 17-month operation, nicknamed ``Cat-Com'' for Catch
Communications, was built around a Hialeah, Fla. company called RA
Communications & Computers Inc. set up by the FBI.
   The company sold all types of communications and computer
equipment, including cellular telephones, and even offered
de-bugging services to its trusting clients, said Miami U.S.
Attorney Dexter Lehtinen.
   ``The traffickers were hiring undercover agents ... to sweep
their premises, little-be-known to them that the feds were checking
to see whether or not the feds were bugging them,'' Lehtinen said.
   William E. Perry, head of the Miami FBI office, said RA
Communications sold state-of-the-art equipment to the traffickers
and soon was arranging communications to allow the traffickers to
talk directly by high-band radio to their smuggling ships and their
bosses in Colombia.
   The traffickers, whom Perry called ``top-of-the-line'' U.S.
contacts for drug lords Pablo Escobar Gaviria, Jorge Luis Ochoa
Vasquez and Jose Gonzalo Rodrigues Gacha, soon were basing their
smuggling operations out of the Hialeah company, unaware that
cameras and tape machines were recording their conversations.
   RA Communications ``essentially was used as a clubhouse or a
meeting place for first-line drug traffickers associated with the
Medellin and Cali Cartels,'' Perry said.
   The FBI and other agencies, including the Drug Enforcement
Administration, Customs Service, Coast Guard and local law
enforcement, had to walk a thin line because they needed to keep the
traffickers' confidence while enforcing the U.S. policy of not
allowing any drugs to enter the country, even in an undercover
operation.
   ``So they would creatively stop or seize the load, but do it in
such a way that would not alert the trafficking indivuiduals that
the evidence must have been accumulated through that operation,''
Lehtinen said.
   U.S. naval warships and U.S. Coast Guard cutters acted on
information provided by the FBI undercover operation to interdict
vessels carrying the drugs headed for the United States from South
America.
   The seizures occurred in Mexico, Florida, and other locations, on
land and at sea.
   In one instance, a sailboat containing nearly 900 pounds of
cocaine from Colombia was piloted by FBI sources hired by the drug
traffickers. The FBI had planned to seize the drugs covertly and
tell the traffickers that the sailboat had sunk with the crew lost
at sea.
   When bad weather hit, however, the Coast Guard interceded,
rescuing the FBI and civilian personnel aboard and recovering the
cocaine. The boat sank.
   Among those arrested in Miami are two former Miami police
officers who had been out on bond while awaiting trial in a previous
drug case, and singer Raul Alfonso.

<HEAD>Inmates Building Their Own Prison</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former sheriff, a few businessmen, a
microbiologist and some drug dealers are working side-by-side to
turn five surplus buildings at a naval base into their own prison.
   They are among 70 inmates building a new minimum-security federal
penitentiary at Saufley Field west of this Florida Panhandle city.
   The work is expected to be completed by mid-January but an open
house is scheduled for local officials Friday.
   A bank owner with an architectural degree drew up the renovation
blueprints. Other inmates do everything from plumbing to painting.
   ``I'm a union plumber,'' said Billy Joe Campbell, 38, of North
Miami Beach, serving time for a marijuana conviction. ``I'm doing
everything according to code. I take pride in my work.''
   Campbell is supervising everything from new bathrooms to
sprinkler system repairs.
   His assistant is Steve Reece, 46, a former microbiology teacher
from Greensboro, N.C., who was convicted on a methamphetamine charge.
   Saufley Field is a naval training systems center that provides
logistical and engineering support services for Navy and Marine
training. No aircraft are based there, but its runways are used for
landing and take-off practice by training aircraft from Whiting
Field near Milton.
   The prison renovation began in June when 15 inmates were brought
to Saufley from the federal prison at Eglin Air Force Base, about 40
miles away, and the work force was increased to its present level
last month, said prison Superintendent Mark Henry.
   He was unable to say how much money the government is saving by
having the prisoners renovate existing facilities.
   The renovation work is expected to cost $500,000 with the inmates
being paid 11 cents an hour for their work, he said.
   Eventually, Saufley will house 320 inmates, mainly from the
Panhandle and South Alabama areas, Henry said.
   Most will be prisoners committed for drug-related crimes and many
others will be sent here on tax- or bank-fraud convictions, Henry
said.
   He said the government's 51 prisons are operating at 157 percent
of capacity and the situation may get worse. Tough new sentencing
guidelines and abolition of parole are expected to nearly double the
present 44,000-inmate population by 1993, he said.
   Saufley is one of nine new prisons planned for opening within the
next year and 25 scheduled for the next five years.
   As a minimum-security facility, the new prison will not require
new fences or additional security measures at the base, Henry said.
   Like most minimum-security prisons it appears attractive with
inmates wearing street clothes after their work day is completed and
amenities such as chess boards and a soft ice cream machine.
   ``While this may look nice, it's still prison,'' Henry insisted.
``The people who are here get up when we tell them to, eat when we
tell them to, take the jobs we want them to.''

   NBC White House correspondent Chris Wallace is
moving to ABC next month to help develop a new prime-time news
program for the network on which he will be chief correspondent, ABC
announced Tuesday.
   Wallace had recently served as moderator of NBC's ``Meet the
Press.'' He is being replaced on that program by Garrick Utley, host
of NBC's ``Sunday Today,'' which is moving to Washington from New
York.
   Wallace's contract with NBC is up in January. ABC spokeswoman
Joanne Berg said ABC had reached an agreement with Wallace ``in
principle'' and hoped he would be at his new job in January.
   No details of the new news program are available yet. It is
slated to premiere in the spring of 1989.

   Police arrested the editor of a business
magazine Tuesday but later released him after he apologized for an
article implying Kenya had changed proposed land legislation under
pressure from Britain.
   Attorney General Matthew G. Muli described the article as ``a
complete distortion of the whole truth of the matter and, therefore,
a complete falsehood.''
   It involved a proposed amendment to bar foreigners from buying
agricultural and commercial land in Kenya. This capitalist-leaning
East African nation's annual population growth of about 3.8 percent
_ the world's highest _ has aggravated a land shortage.
   Peter Kareithi, the Financial Review editor-in-chief who was
detained for three hours, said: ``The police referred to a sentence
in the article and said it created the impression Parliament acted
under pressure from Britain.
   ``I agreed such an impression might have been created and
apologized to the government and the vice president,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
   In its Dec. 5 issue, the magazine said the amendment was dropped
because of hostile reaction in the former colonizing power Britain,
where Kenyan Vice President Josephat Karanja was visiting to assure
investors they still were welcome.
   The Review said Karanja was ``told in no uncertain terms that the
just-passed amendment was hostile to would-be investors and was
likely to send those who had their money in the Kenyan economy
packing home.
   ``He (Karanja) must have hastily telephoned Nairobi to say the
bill did not augur well for continued British investments and should
be scrapped,'' the magazine said without attribution.
   Kareithi, 36, said Criminal Investigations Department director
Noah arap Too told him the government was offended by the magazine
saying Karanja might have telephoned Nairobi.
   Muli said the amendment only had been published and not passed
when the anti-foreigner clause was deleted.
   Parliament passed the amendment Oct. 14 without imposing
restrictions on foreigners buying land.
   Kareithi's arrest also followed government criticism of a Nov. 28
editorial alleging government officials were involved in flooding
the Kenyan market with imported gunny sacks while local bag makers
have had to lay off 3,000 workers. The bags are used primarily for
grain and produce.
   Two days after the editorial appeared, a government statement
said the ``insinuations implied in the editorial are malicious, in
bad taste and are calculated to ridicule the government.''
   Earlier this year, the government banned the magazine Beyond,
published by Kenya's National Christian Council of Churches, after
it described Feb. 22 primary parliamentary elections as a ``mockery
of democracy.''

   Stanford University economist Michael Boskin,
chosen to be President-elect George Bush's chief economic adviser,
said Tuesday that the new administration will be successful in
cutting the budget deficit while upholding Bush's campaign pledge to
avoid new taxes.
   One of the key architects of Bush's ``flexible freeze,'' Boskin
defended the proposal saying that it would produce a balanced budget
through holding the growth of overall spending to the rate of
inflation.
   Boskin, a conservative economist who served as a top Bush
campaign adviser, was named by the president-elect to be chairman of
his Council of Economic Advisers.
   Critics of the flexible freeze have charged it is unworkable and
would force draconian reductions in some areas of domestic spending
to make up for faster growth in such programs as Social Security,
which Bush has vowed to leave untouched.
   In a speech Tuesday before his appointment was announced, Boskin
defended the flexible freeze and predicted that it could balance the
budget somewhere around 1993, depending on how fast the economy
grows in the next few years.
   ``I think you will see the Bush administration take strong action
on the budget deficit quickly after the inauguration and I think it
will be on the spending side of the budget, consistent with the
flexible freeze,'' Boskin told a policy conference sponsored by the
American Enterprise Institute.
   Bush on Tuesday also named Texas oilman Robert Mosbacher as
secretary of commerce and tapped Carla Hills to be trade
representative. Bush earlier announced his choice of Richard Darman
as his budget director and asked Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
to stay on in the new administration.
   In making the economic appointments, Bush pledged that his
administration would take the lead in proposing a solution to
Congress to reduce the budget deficit, which climbed to $155.1
billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.
   ``I do feel the urgency of getting something moving on the
deficit front and I will do my level best early on to take the
offense,'' Bush said. He said he would not simply leave the problem
up to Congress to solve.
   ``I am not going to do that. I am going to lead,'' Bush said. But
he refused to be specific on how detailed a budget proposal he
planned to submit once he takes office, saying his advisers were
still working on those details.
   Boskin, in his speech, responded to critics who charge that the
flexible freeze will not produce a balanced budget because of new
spending demands on government and rapid growth in such politically
sensitive programs as Social Security and Medicare.
   ``It's certainly valid technical economics if your goal is to get
to a balanced budget in the 1993 period, give or take a year,''
Boskin said.
   ``I can assure you that people who are very careful with numbers,
myself included, have gone over this and it is eminently do-able,''
he said. ``So the accusations that this doesn't add up are kind of
silly and not based on economic reality.''
   Boskin said Bush would quickly appoint budget negotiators to work
with Congress on a spending compromise.
   ``I know (Bush) takes the deficit very seriously and I expect him
to deal forcefully with it early on,'' he said.

<HEAD>Confusion Surrounds Starting Time For Closing Notices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Labor Department is advising employers who
anticipate closing their plants or implementing large layoffs in
February to start providing 60 days' advance notice as of Tuesday
despite some confusion over the timetable of the new law.
   Although the plant-closing notice law _ formally the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification or WARN Act _ does not take
effect until Feb. 4, there have been different interpretations on
whether companies should begin providing 60 days' notice then or 60
days beforehand.
   Some also have interpreted the new law as requiring notices for
the first 60 days after Feb. 4 limited to the number of days between
that date and when the layoffs or plant closing actually occur.
   Under that interpretation, a layoff occurring next March 6 would
require only 30 days' advance notice to the affected workers and
local government officials.
   In an ``interim interpretive rule,'' the Labor Department said
all three interpretations have merit.
   But until the department issues final regulatons by next April or
the issue is resolved in court, it said in a Federal Register notice
that ``employers are best advised to proceed conservatively and to
provide notice ... as early as Dec. 6 ... in view of this possible
liability.''
   No notice is required for layoffs or plant closings that occur
between now and Feb. 4.
   The law was passed by Congress last July and enacted on Aug. 4
without the signature of President Reagan, who called it ``a step in
the wrong direction.''
   In May, Reagan had vetoed a trade bill, largely because it
required 60 days' notices for plant closings and layoffs of more
than 50 people at a time.
   But after polls showed that more than 80 percent of the public
favored the mandatory notices, Democrats and labor unions moved to
pass the measure as a separate law, holding the trade bill hostage
in the meantime. The trade bill also eventually passed Congress and
was signed by Reagan.
   A 15-year battle to win the mandatory notices was renewed by the
AFL-CIO in 1986 after an average 2.2 million workers a year lost
their jobs to plant closings and mass layoffs through the first half
of the decade.
   Government studies showed that more than half of those workers
received less than two weeks' advance notice and that only 18
percent of the employers gave three weeks' or more notice.
   The law's enactment was the labor federation's first major
legislative victory over business opposition since last getting
minimum wage increases through Congress in 1978.
   Since last October, the Labor Department had been advising
business groups they should look upon Dec. 6 as the day to start
providing the notices for layoffs occurring after Feb. 4. So have
major business groups which vigorously opposed the law, including
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and National Association of
Manufacturers.
   Sue Meisinger, a vice president for the American Society of
Personnel Administration, said the effective date that notices are
required is one of several ambiguities in the law.
   ``You're going to find out how the ambiguities work out only
after litigation,'' she said. ``There are a lot of issues to be
played out over time. A lot of employers are going to find out how
the law works only after they get slapped with a civil complaint.''
   Because the law does not empower any agency to enforce it,
failure to comply with it can be addressed only thourgh civil suits
filed by affected employees, unions or local governments in federal
courts.
   The courts are empowered to order up to 60 days in back pay and
benefits plus attorneys' fees to affected workers and up to $30,000
to local governments who did not get the required notices.
   Basically, the law forbids companies employing 100 or more
full-time workers at any one location from ordering a plant closed
or a mass layoff involving 50 or more people until 60 days after
they have imformed the affected employees and local government
officials about it.
   Exempted from coverage are companies with fewer than 100
full-time workers, temporary layoffs of less than six months and
layoffs caused by natural disasters such as last summer's drought.
   Employers also do not have to provide the 60 days' advance notice
of the layoffs were caused by unforeseeable business circumstances
such as the unexpected cancellation of a major contract,
international oil shortages or strikes and lockouts.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ronald H. Brown, Jesse Jackson's chief
operative at last summer's Democratic convention, entered the race
for chairman of the party Tuesday with a declaration that he was
seeking the office as ``my own man.''
   Brown, who also worked on the presidential campaigns of Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis, said at a
press conference he was an ``independent, mainstream progressive
Democrat'' independent of Jackson or any other party leader.
   Brown said he considered himself the front-runner in what was
shaping up as at least a five-way race to succeed Paul Kirk, the
Democratic National Committee chairman who announced Monday he would
leave his post after four years.
   And while welcoming the support of Jackson's supporters on the
DNC, Brown emphasized his long party service and independence.
   ``I'm nobody's candidate. I'm my own man,'' he said. If elected,
``no one will be given the advantage'' as the party looks toward
1992, he said.
   Also running or expected to run for the party post were Michigan
Democratic chairman Richard Wiener and former Reps. Michael Barnes
of Maryland, Jim Jones of Oklahoma and Jim Stanton of Ohio.
   Wiener, who announced his candidacy for the national post Monday,
told reporters Tuesday he planned to spend upwards of $100,000 on
the race and would release in about two weeks a list of DNC
supporters representing all regions of the country.
   ``I believe I enter as a strong contender, as a favorite,'' he
said, downplaying other candidates' counts of supporters and
refusing to release his own. Adding together the numbers of
supporters claimed by each candidate would yield double the 404
members on the DNC, he said.
   The DNC meets Feb. 9-10 in Washington to select a new chairman.
   ``All of the other candidates are good Democrats,'' said Wiener,
who described himself as having a political philosphy modeled after
that of John F. Kennedy.
   Instead of philosophy, the ability to run the party machinery
would be foremost, the outgoing president of the Association of
State Democratic Chairs said.
   ``I believe the most important job ... is to have this party
ready in 1992 to win the presidency of the United States,'' he said.
The party needed to build a ``fighting machine'' to counter the
Republican apparatus which will be headed by Lee Atwater, who was
George Bush's campaign manager.
   What is needed is to build upon Kirk's fund-raising and
organizational efforts, he said, but not changing the party's basic
message.
   ``I do not believe it was a philosphical problem in this
election,'' he said. Michael Dukakis ``allowed himself to be
defined'' in a way that distorted Democratic values, which he said
included a strong defense and no tolerance of crime.
   Barnes declared his candidacy in a mailgram sent out Monday to
Democratic leaders. Jones planned to make a formal announcement next
week, while Stanton said Monday he was ``looking forward to a
candidacy.''

   Five major Soviet artists and two Soviet
orchestras have signed with RCA records in what is said to be the
largest group of Russians to enter a recording contract with a
Western company.
   ``All of them are making their first long-term agreement in the
West,'' said Michael Emmerson, president of BMG Classics, at a news
conference on Tuesday. ``I think we have a lot to be thankful to
glasnost for.'' BMG, a German company, bought RCA Records two years
ago.
   The first recording by 17-year-old pianist Evgeny Kissin of
Rachmaninoff's ``Concerto No. 2'' with the London Symphony will be
released Dec. 20.
   Other artists are conductor Yuri Temirkanov, violinist Vladimir
Spivakov and the Moscow Virtuosi, which Spivakov conducts, violist
Yuri Bashmet and cellist Natalia Gutman.
   Temirkanov will record with the Philadelphia Orchestra, Royal
Philharmonic of London and Leningrad Philharmonic, of which he is
music director.
   ``Basically we made five-year deals,'' Emmerson said. ``We
generally have options for further recordings after that period.''
   Sir Colin Davis, the British conductor who is music director of
the Bavarian Radio Symphony, also has been signed for 20 albums over
a five-year period. Emmerson said that each year's output will
include an opera, starting with ``The Flying Dutchman.''
   BMG Classics is beginning to release recordings on four labels,
all to be distributed worldwide, Emmerson said.
   ``RCA Victor is for Broadway and crossover,'' he said. ``RCA
Victor, red seal, is for orchestral and instrumental. Eurodisc is
the vocal, choral and operatic label. From Jan. 1, 1989, Deutsche
Harmonia Mundi will have baroque, Renaissance and authentic
performances (of early music).''

   PLO chief Yasser Arafat met with a group
of American Jews on Tuesday to promote his new image of moderation
and build support for the declaration of an independent Palestinian
state issued last month.
   The meeting, arranged by the Swedish government, took place a
week before Arafat is to address the U.N. General Assembly in
Geneva. The assembly decided to move its session from New York to
the European U.N. headquarters when the United States refused Arafat
a visa.
   A Swedish government statement after the meeting said ``major
issues were addressed and important progress was made.'' When
reporters asked Arafat about the results of the meeting, he replied:
``It is better to wait and see.''
   Mounted police sealed off the snow-covered park around the Haga
Palace, where Arafat and aides conferred with the five-member Jewish
delegation from the United States.
   Foreign Minister Sten Andersson was in the 18th century building
for the first hour of the meeting, then left and returned two hours
later for the end.
   Ingvar Carlsson, the prime minister, cut short a trip to Paris to
return home and act as host at a dinner for the two delegations.
   He greeted Arafat with an embrace after the meeting and received
the Jewish group at his office 40 minutes later. None of the
delegation members commented to reporters.
   Rita Hauser led the Jewish group. She is chairman of the U.S.
branch of the International Center for Peace in the Middle East, a
coalition of leftist organizations in Israel and other countries.
   Abba Eban, former Israeli foreign minister, is international
chairman of the center. Its Israeli branch includes prominent
members of the center-left Labor Party of Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres, to which Eban belongs.
   The center believes Israel should give up at least some of the
Arab territory captured in the 1967 Middle East war and many of its
members urge the Israeli government to deal directly with the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Israel and several Jewish organizations protested the meeting.
The Israeli Foreign Ministry lodged an official protest with the
Swedish ambassador.
   An Israeli source said privately a message was sent to one
participant, Menachem Rosensaft of the Labor Zionist Alliance, by
his group's parent organization ordering him to resign all official
positions.
   Sweden's Foreign Ministry described the delegation members as
``prominent personalities'' representing a significant portion of
U.S. Jewish opinion, but an Israeli diplomat in Stockholm dismissed
them as ``unimportant.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Benjamin Cohen, president of the American Zionist Federation,
issued a statement in New York saying, ``The Americans who are at
the meeting are participating for their own benefit, without the
support of any recognized organization in the Jewish community.''
   Israeli refuses to deal with the PLO and has made it a criminal
offense for any Israeli citizen to do so. It has urged Israel's U.S.
supporters to abstain from contacts with an organization it
describes as a band of terrorists.
   Other members of the Jewish delegation were Drora Kass, the
center's executive director; Stanley Sheinbaum, an economist and
publisher from Los Angeles, and Avraham Udovitch, chairman of the
department for Near East Studies at Princeton University.
   Arafat's delegation included Mahmoud Darwish and Yasser
Abed-Rabbo, both members of the PLO executive committee; his
spokesman Bassam Abu Sharif, and Akram Haniah, a former journalist
expelled by Israel last year.
   Ministry officials said Andersson spent months arranging the
meeting. The newspaper Aftonbladet called it a personal triumph for
the foreign minister.
   Sweden said it was a way to ``contribute to the peace process in
the Middle East.''
   Andersson has urged Israel to respond to what he called ``the
historic decisions'' announced Nov. 15 in Algiers, when the PLO
accepted U.N. resolutions that recognize Israel.
   Carlsson told reporters before leaving Paris, in an apparent
reference to the PLO and Israel: ``If a dialogue can be started
between the two parties, it would be a major breakthrough.''

<HEAD>Gun Education Program Set To Begin Amid NRA Criticism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public schools in Dade County where 17 children have
been killed by guns this year plan to go ahead with a ``say no to
guns'' program despite opposition from the National Rifle
Association.
   ``I have not seen the materials but it seems like an attempt to
terrorize and scare the children rather than to educate them in a
calm, sane manner,'' said Marion Hammer, head of the NRA's Florida
chapter.
   But Joe Fernandez, Dade's school superintendent, says he doesn't
care what the NRA thinks.
   ``If it was in my power, we'd outlaw guns completely,'' Fernandez
said.
   The $25,000 ``Guns Kill _ Say NO to Guns'' program, drawn up in
reaction to the unprecedented number of Dade children killed by guns
this year, will begin Friday, only days after a junior at Miami
Palmetto High School died of gunshot wounds.
   Sixteen-year-old Lowell Thomas Jr. was gunned down by someone in
a car outside his family's apartment Sunday night, according to
Metro police. Investigators say they have identified two suspects, a
Palmetto High dropout and a current student at the school.
   Beginning Friday, Dade County school children are to be
instructed that the best way to handle a gun is to not pick it up in
the first place.
   School officials hope the message of their unprecedented Gun
Safety Awareness program will help prevent accidental deaths, if not
deliberate killings.
   ``I'm not sure if the gun safety awareness program is geared to
cope with premeditated murder,'' said School Board member Janet
McAliley. ``This program should help to prevent accidental deaths
such as when a child picks up a gun that may or not be loaded.''
   Fernandez agreed.
   ``We are not focused on those who have criminal intent. I'm not
sure what we could do about that,'' Fernandez said. ``We're focused
on kids who wind up playing with guns, either they don't know
they're loaded or they play Russian roulette.''
   But Hammer argued the schools are taking the wrong approach.
   Hammer said she knows there is a lot of anguish after a handgun
slaying _ especially when the victim is a teen-ager _ but she
insists that ``you can't teach by scaring someone to death.''
   Hammer added: ``If `Just Say No' campaigns worked, our drug
problem wouldn't exist anymore.''
   The new program, expected to be formally approved at Wednesday's
board meeting, starts with principals reading a prepared text during
the morning announcements, followed by a discussion between students
and teachers at the elementary and middle-school level.
   Phased in throughout the year will be parent workshops, public
service announcements and, for older students, a video detailing the
consequences of getting shot _ and the agonizing recovery period.
   The NRA had proposed teaching gun safety classes, but the schools
rejected the idea.
   A proposal by the NRA this fall to distribute its gun safety
coloring book in Chicago schools is still being considered by the
Board of Education there, school board spokesman Bob Saigh said
Tuesday.

   The biological father of a child cannot
stake a claim to the infant if he failed to support its mother
during pregnancy, an attorney told the Florida Supreme Court Tuesday
in a custody case.
   The court is being asked to decide if a man who virtually ignored
his pregnant girlfriend after she refused to have an abortion can
retain the right to challenge her decision to put the baby up for
adoption.
   ``The putative father knew from the very beginning that his woman
was pregnant,'' said attorney Chandler Muller, who represented the
adoptive parents, known as Bob and Jane Doe in the case. ``He turned
his back on the developing child.''
   Muller said he hoped the court ``will have the courage to look at
pre-birth abandonment.''
   The youngster is called John Doe and his natural parents have
been dubbed Richard and Mary Roe because of court-ordered anonymity.
   John L. O'Donnell, Jr., attorney for the natural parents, who
were not married at the time of the boy's birth in September 1986,
argued before the court that the natural father did everything the
law allowed to assert his rights.
   ``Our position has always been the statute allows consideration
only of post-birth activity,'' said O'Donnell. ``I'm not saying this
man was perfect, but this is not a man who turned his back and
walked away.''
   The mother was encouraged by her rabbi and an attorney to give
the baby up for adoption after the father initially refused to marry
her and urged her to have an abortion.
   In July 1986, the mother moved from Phoenix to Winter Park, where
the adoptive parents provided an apartment, paid her medical
expenses and gave her $300 a month for expenses.
   She spoke confidently of giving up the baby in talks with the
adoptive parents' lawyer and a state social worker, saying the
natural father had abandoned her. She gave written consent for the
adoption two days after the boy's birth.
   The infant went home with his new parents Sept. 15, the same day
the father learned of the birth. Two days later, the father
contacted an attorney to file papers acknowleding paternity, hoping
to stop the adoption without his consent.
   The couple reconciled and were married in November 1986, two
months after the baby was born. The mother supports her husband's
fight for the infant's return.
   In June 1987, a judge ruled against the father, saying he had
effectively abandoned the child during the mother's pregnancy, but
the 5th District Court of Appeal reversed the ruling in March,
saying it was necessary to have the consent of the biological father.
   The appeals court left the adoptive parents with custody of the
boy until the Supreme Court reviews the case.
   The attorneys said they expected a decision could take anywhere
from a few weeks to several months.

   The State Department, reporting on the eve of
the U.S.-Soviet meeting, said Tuesday there have been significant
human rights improvements inside the Soviet Union under President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   But the department also said those improvements have been uneven
and marked by reversals and inconsistencies, and Moscow remains in
violation of the human rights provisions of the Helsinki accord, in
part because of its continuing occupation of Afghanistan.
   Moscow committed itself to withdrawing from Afghanistan by Feb.
15, but the Soviets announced a suspension last month, complaining
about attacks on the Red Army by U.S.-armed Afghan guerrillas.
   The report also said the Soviets ``continue to undermine the
basic principles'' of the Helsinki agreement on relations between
nations by supporting the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia.
   The conclusions were contained in the State Department's
semiannual report to Congress on implementation of the Helsinki
agreement, which involves 33 European nations, the United States and
Canada. The accord was aimed at promoting cooperation among the
nations and the protection of human rights.
   The report was issued one day before Gorbachev meets with
President Reagan roved
considerably'' in 1988 and cited increases in emigration, the
release of some, but not all, political prisoners and reform of the
practice of committing political offenders to mental hospitals.
   ``There were reports of fewer beatings in psychiatric
hospitals,'' the report said. ``Dissidents reported that the
punitive use of drugs continued, however, and compiled a list of 90
individuals known to have been in psychiatric hospitals at one time
and whose whereabouts are unknown today.''
   The report said unofficial groups and publications ``continued to
flourish although some activities were subjected to harsh press
attacks.''
   A July 28 decree by the Supreme Soviet on demonstrations had a
mixed impact, the report said, permitting some large demonstrations
while forbidding others.
   The report said that some of the more than 30,000 unofficial
groups formed since Gorbachev began to implement his new policies
are ``political parties in all but name'' and said two of them have
publicly declared themselves to be ``opposition political parties.''
   ``On the whole, Soviet authorities were tolerant of these groups,
although they endeavored to channel their activities,'' the report
said.
   But it said the changes have not yet been made permanent through
the adoption of appropriate legislation and regulations ``to
guarantee respect for individual rights.''
   ``Although the diminishing numbers of political prisoners
signaled positive progress,'' the report said, ``the lack of legal
protection of individual rights continued to permit the arbitrary
use of power by Soviet authorities.''
   It said that although the numbers of political prisoners have
``fallen substantially'' to an estimated 100 to 200, conditions in
labor camps continued to be ``deplorable.''
   The report said recently released prisoners cited ``inadequate
diet, poor or no medical treatment, beatings, repeated sentences in
punishment cells and few or no family visits or correspondence.''
   However, it noted that on July 25 the Soviet Presidium struck
from the criminal code a provision mandating reduced rations for
prisoners in punishment and isolation cells.
   On the subject of religious activity, the report said that
``while there have been positive developments, freedom to profess
one's religion remains severely restricted in the Soviet Union.''

<TEXT>
   The brass and marble were polished, the holiday
decorations were hung, and all was ready for a publicist's dream:
Donald Trump, famous capitalist, guiding Mikhail Gorbachev, famous
communist, through the lobby of Trump Tower, famous temple of
conspicuous consumption.
   But when the Soviet leader's final itinerary _ or at least his
final tentative itinerary _ was released Monday, Trump and his tower
had been dealt out.
   Soviet officials said the original announcement that Trump was on
the tour was the result of a misunderstanding. But Trump aides said
the Soviets had told them Gorbachev would visit, and Secret Service
agents had checked out the Fifth Avenue building.
   Norma Foederer, Trump's top aide, said that Gorbachev's schedule
was too tight for a visit to the tower, but that Trump and his wife
Ivana were invited to a reception at the Soviet mission Thursday
night.
   Trump's spokesman, Dan Klores, said last week that the developer
met Gorbachev at a White House dinner during the Soviet leader's
last visit to the United States. When he heard Gorbachev was coming
to New York, he wrote him a note inviting him to visit Trump Tower
and the Plaza Hotel, which Trump also owns.
   A Trump-Gorbachev meeting had been criticized by advocates of the
homeless, who in turn offered to show Gorbachev another side of the
city. The Soviet leader also spurned that offer.
   On Tuesday, however, as he walked through the tower's lobby,
Trump must have thought for a moment that his luck had changed.
There was Gorbachev, head birthmark and all, surrounded by crowds of
people!
   In cruel fact, a crew from the syndicated television program ``A
Current Affair'' had brought the winner of a Gorbachev look-alike
contest to the tower to introduce him to Trump as the real thing,
according to Isabelle Fernandes, a spokeswoman for the program.
   She said Trump appeared to think he was meeting the real thing,
but Ms. Foerderer disagreed: ``Donald said that from a distance he
looked like he might have been him, but when you got close, you
could see he was an obvious fraud.''
   Several years ago Trump expressed an interest in building and
operating a luxury hotel in Moscow, but said he and Soviet officials
could not agree on terms.
   Trump Tower is divided among shops, offices and apartments,
including Trump's own penthouse triplex.

   President-elect George Bush and Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee,
disagreed over the need to raise taxes Tuesday, but cemented what
they said was a long-time friendship.
   ``We talked about taxes but he did not change his position at
all,'' Rostenkowski said after the Illinois Democrat ate lunch with
Bush at the vice president's office.
   Bush was ``very firm in the fact that he did not want to discuss
the increasing of revenue,'' said the head of the tax-writing panel.
   ``Everybody knows my position on taxes,'' said Bush, who vowed
during the campaign to hold firm against tax hikes.
   When Rostenkowski broached his idea of raising the federal
gasoline tax by 10 or 15 cents per gallon, Bush replied, ``That's
interesting ... That is as far as he went with respect to discussing
taxes,'' the congressman said.
   A 15-cent increase in the gas tax would bring in about $15
billion annually, a mere dent in the $150-billion-a-year-deficit.
   Rostenkowski, echoing the line of some congressional Democrats,
said he does not think the deficit can be brought down without
increasing revenues and cutting domestic and defense spending.
   In Rostenkowski's view, lingering high deficits will destabilize
the economy to the point where the nation's standard of living will
decline.
   But he said the decision to initiate tax increases is in the
hands of the president-elect. The Democrats will not take such a
step.
   Earlier, Rostenkowski predicted Bush would have little trouble
backing away from his no-tax-increase pledge if he wants to do so.
   While the men were at odds over taxes, Bush said they enjoy each
other. ``What we did today ... is renew a friendship,'' the
president-elect said. Bush served on Ways and Means with
Rostenkowski when he was a congressman from Texas in the late 1960s.
   Said Rostenkowski: ``George Bush is the same George Bush he was
when he was a member of Congress ... He has a great perception of
what the legislative process is.'' He has called Bush a friend.
   Bush will also have an easier time dealing with Congress because
he understands the system, Rostenkowski said.
   Rostenkowski announced Tuesday that his committee will holding
hearings beginning Jan. 31 on whether the tax code should be changed
as a result of the recent wave of corporate takeovers, especially
those requiring huge debts.
   ``It is... apropriate to ask if these transactions allow certain
corporations to escape the payment of fair taxes, thereby harming
the average American taxpayer,'' said Rostenkowski, who made no
specific proposal for a new tax or other change in the law.
   Meanwhile, speaking at a breakfast sponsored by the Gannett Co.
Inc., the incoming chairman of the Senate Budget Committee predicted
that Bush would have to ask for a tax increase before the midway
point of his term.
   ``My view is there will be additional taxes ... within the next
two years,'' said Sen. James R. Sasser, D-Tenn. Bush would again ask
people to ``read my lips,'' he said, but this time he'll be saying,
``Let's get some additional revenue in the till.''

   At a speech in New York Tuesday night, Rostenkowski argued
against imposing a national sales tax or making major changes in the
income tax.
   A sales tax would require a new administrative structure,
Rostenkowski said. And although there may be some remaining
deductions and exclusions that could be reduced, ``the income taxes
ought not be a candidate for serious surgery.''
   He argued against any soak-the-rich tax increase, saying any plan
must be balanced. And he rejected a favorite Bush campaign proposal
to cut the tax on capital gains as a plan that would hand more money
to the rich _ not raise federal revenues.

<HEAD>Conservative Groups Plan to Flood Reagan With Requests for North
Pardon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A conservative group said Tuesday it is
organizing a drive to flood the White House switchboard with calls
urging President Reagan to pardon Oliver North before he leaves
office in January.
   The president has indicated he will not issue a pardon for North,
who is under indictment for his role in the Iran-Contra affair. But
he also has said he will not give up classified government documents
that North says he needs for his defense, a position that could keep
North from coming to trial.
   ``We are disappointed but undaunted,'' Robert Grant, president of
the American Freedom Coalition, said of Reagan's refusal so far to
pardon North. ``We will not halt our national project until Col.
North is either exonerated by the courts or justly pardoned by the
president.''
   North was a lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps, on the
National Security Council staff under Adm. John Poindexter, when the
alleged offenses occurred involving the diversion to the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels of proceeds from U.S. arms sales to Iran.
   Grant and three other well-known conservatives held a news
conference against a backdrop of dozens of mail bags which they said
held petitions for a North pardon that would be delivered to the
White House.
   ``We believe that North and his family have already been severely
and justly punished through public humiliation and extensive legal
defense fees,'' Grant said. ``This is no way, in my opinion, to
treat a patriotic war hero who had the guts to stand up to Congress
and its wishy washy on-and-off support of the freedom fighters.''
   Peter T. Flaherty, chairman of Citizens for Reagan, said the
president is going out of office ``a winner'' but that if North is
not pardoned, ``the Reagan foreign policy will be on trial for
several months after he's left office.'' He said failure to pardon
North ``will confirm congressional control of foreign policy.''
   Richard Viguerie, chairman of United Conservatives of America,
said only three groups want a trial for North: the press, which
likes a hot story; Democrats, who want to keep the Bush
administration on the defensive; foreign enemies ``who will benefit
by having our country divided and our intelligence systems paralyzed
at the start of a new administration.''
   Richard Ichord, a former congressman from Missouri and vice
chairman of Grant's group, said North was caught up in a policy
dispute between Congress and Reagan.
   The country, he said, ``has little to gain and much to lose from
a criminal trial that could require the disclosure of national
secrets and even the testimony of a former president and a sitting
president in order to protect the rights of the accused.''

   A former nursing home supervisor charged
with killing two patients told police her alleged accomplice killed
six elderly patients, all but one for the ``emotional release'' it
provided her, according to court documents.
   Catherine Wood, 26, and former nurse's aide Gwendolyn Graham, 25,
are suspects in eight deaths last year at Alpine Manor Nursing Home
in this Grand Rapids suburb, authorities said.
   Wood was charged Monday with two counts of murder and held
without bond pending a Dec. 16 preliminary hearing. Graham was
arrested Sunday near her home in Tyler, Texas, and arraigned on one
count of murder. She is being held on $1 million bond while fighting
extradition to Michigan.
   During questioning by police Oct. 7, Wood said Graham had
suffocated the elderly patients in their beds and collected a
``souvenir'' from each, according to search warrants released Monday.
   She said Graham told her ``that each of the killings provided an
emotional release for her,'' with the exception of the death of
97-year-old Edith Cook, who was killed to end her suffering from
gangrene, the court document said.
   Wood also told police that she and Graham lived together from
September 1986 to July 1987 and ``were involved as lovers in a
homosexual relationship,'' the documents said. The alleged killings
occurred between January and May 1987.
   Wood told police she witnessed the Jan. 18, 1987, killing of
60-year-old Marguerite Chambers, an Alzheimer's disease patient. She
``observed Gwendolyn Gail Graham suffocating (the patient) by
pressing a washcloth beneath the chin of Chambers and another
washcloth over Chambers' mouth and nose,'' the warrant said. Wood
told police she did not intervene.
   Wood also told police Graham would tell her of the killings
either just before or after they occurred.
   At the time of their deaths, the eight female patients were
believed to have died from natural causes and no autopsies were
performed.
   Wood, who worked at the home from July 1985 to this October and
most recently was supervisor of nurses' aides, is charged with
killing Cook and Chambers. Graham, who worked at the home from June
1986 to July 1987, is charged with killing Cook. Both bodies were
exhumed last week, but autopsies have proven inconclusive.
   Both aides had received good marks from patients and neither was
fired, nursing home officials said.
   Walker Police Chief Walt Sprenger said Tuesday six more deaths
were being investigated and that more charges against the two women
were likely. He said he did not know if any other bodies would be
exhumed.
   Sprenger would not discuss possible motives in the case, but has
ruled out mercy killings and financial profit. He said the women's
lesbian relationship was ``part of a complex web that brings the
whole thing together.''
   Wood's ex-husband, who first approached police about the deaths
in October 1988 and sparked the investigation, told police his
former wife admitted helping while Graham suffocated the patients,
hoping to spell the word ``murder'' with the victims' initials, the
warrants said.
   Sprenger said he has not been able to substantiate that
allegation. The initials of the alleged victims, identified in
warrants and by relatives contacted by nursing home officials, do
not spell out ``murder.''
   Employees at the nursing home said Wood had a quick temper.
   ``She (Wood) would throw diapers at me and cuss at me,'' Patricia
Patterson, a nurse's aide at Alpine, told The Grand Rapids Press.
``Cathy was always such an angry person.''

   President-elect George Bush should not accept
the conventional wisdom that ``political realities'' dictate
Pentagon budget cuts, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said
Tuesday.
   Members of Congress who offer that wisdom to the incoming
administration seldom have much to say, ``to me or to our citizens,
about overseas threats or `military realities' which do not conform
to their version of political reality,'' added Adm. William J. Crowe
Jr., the joint chiefs chairman.
   ``This inability to consider strategic questions in a reasonable
and consistent manner is both inefficient and dangerous,'' he said,
adding the danger is intensified because the nation's fiscal
problems are occuring at a time of relative peace around the world.
   ``In war, we remember the Alamo, the Maine, Pearl Harbor. In good
times, we forget.''
   Crowe spoke Tuesday night before the World Affairs Council of
Washington, offering a broad review of military and diplomatic
affairs at home and abroad. A text of his speech was released in
advance by the Pentagon.
   The four-star admiral said he wanted to work with Bush to improve
Pentagon management, to convince Congress that stable financing
instead of peak-and-valley cycles could save huge amounts of money,
and to continue improving the nation's ability to fight guerrilla
wars.
   ``Like everything else, Pentagon management is not as bad as the
critics say, nor as good as some defenders argue,'' Crowe said.
``But nevertheless, we are going to need strong leadership to
implement a wide range of reforms.''
   The nation's top military officer said he understood the Pentagon
was unlikely to get all the money it wanted. But he said he would
counsel Bush not to reduce military manpower or the funds needed to
preserve readiness.
   ``Adjustments _ some of them significant _ are clearly ahead as
we conform our forces and our collective security approach to
emerging international realities and evolving challenges, including
economic considerations,'' he declared.
   ``But it would be a grievous _ and probably, ultimately disabling
_ error to undertake those adjustments with an eye only to the
concerns of accountants.''
   Crowe said the diplomatic and military situation in Asia and the
Pacific rim was probably the most stable; the situation in the
Middle East, Central and South America and Near East the least, and
Europe in between.
   The problem in Europe is that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
talks about reforming his nation's economy and downplaying defense,
but Russian military forces are ``still most formidable, structured
and postured for the offensive and backed up by a continued
commitment to modernization,'' Crowe said.
   In the Pacific, the United States will face the ``challenging
issue'' of retaining access to forward bases. But he said that more
important are Mideast tensions, Latin American drug trafficking, the
threat of terrorism, and the need to preserve access to overseas oil.
   ``We'll need flexibility and open-mindedness on all sides, as
well as the wisdom, tenacity and political courage to take a long
view of the national interest,'' Crowe said. ``It's going to be a
tough road in a frequently short-sighted town.''

   About 100 mourners attended a streetside
memorial service Tuesday for a homeless man who died on a sidewalk
after being ejected from a fast-food restaurant where he had
collapsed over a bacon cheeseburger.
   Joseph Emerson Eaton, 38, a member of a prominent New England
family, was found dead just outside the doorway of Carl's Jr.
restaurant on Market Street at 5 a.m. Saturday.
   Coroner's authorities said Eaton suffered from alcoholism, drug
abuse and AIDS-related complex and his arms showed fresh needle
marks. They were waiting for toxicology test results before
determining the exact cause of death.
   Five hours before Eaton died, he had been dragged out and dropped
on the sidewalk by a security guard who said he thought he was
``drunk as a skunk'' when he collapsed unconscious.
   The memorial service was organized by the Rev. Thomas Flowers, an
Eastern Orthodox monk who runs a soup kitchen at the nearby United
Nations Plaza. It was Flowers who found Eaton's stiff, lifeless body
while making rounds in the seedy area known as the Tenderloin
District, just two blocks from City Hall.
   The neighborhood is known for panhandlers, homeless sleeping in
doorways and on benches, and a tent city outside the U.S. Health
Department office demanding more federal funding to fight AIDS.
   Flowers and the Rev. Stephen Graham officiated at the service
attended by approximately 100 mourners, many of them street people
who held candles or carnations in memory of Eaton and 160 ``John
Does'' who have died on San Francisco streets this year.
   As the smell of burning incense enveloped the crowd, Flowers
urged the listeners not to ignore people lying in doorways or on the
street. ``Let the ambulance come quickly when that 911 number is
called _ even if it's down here in the Tenderloin,'' he said.
   ``The most evil thing today is indifference,'' said The Rev.
Cecil Williams of Glide Memorial Methodist Church, which operates a
free food program in the neighborhood.
   Scattered throughout the gathering were gaunt people with
bedrolls or shopping carts laden with belongings. One man had a cart
with a sign, ``Donations to help support two girls'' and a group
called Food Not Bombs distributed free fruit.
   Flowers said he had seen Eaton several times at his soup kitchen,
often in the company of another homeless man known as ``Fast Eddie.''
   Mayor Art Agnos' spokeswoman Eileen Maloney said the mayor had no
comment about Eaton's death because it was a private incident and
could lead to lawsuits. But she said Agnos ``was upset personally.''
   Eaton grew up in the affluent Boston suburb of Duxbury, Mass. His
late grandfather, Charles Freedom Eaton Jr., was a prominent
financier, a founder of Investors Bank & Trust Co. His father,
Joseph Emerson Eaton Sr., is a retired business executive.
   Eaton enjoyed the privileges of his family's wealth, attending
prestigious New England prep schools. But his brother, Nick, a New
Hampshire contractor, said he ``was an alcoholic from the time he
was 13, from the time he took his first drink. And later, he got
heavily into using drugs. But time after time after time, it was
alcohol that brought him his troubles.''
   Relatives said Eaton tried several treatment programs with their
moral and financial support.
   Nick Eaton said his brother called Friday to ask the family to
finance another treatment program. They agreed.
   He never attended college, and worked as a chef and florist. He
moved to San Francisco in 1981 and told his family he was gay.
   ``We accepted his choice of lifestyle,'' said another brother,
Henry Eaton, a reporter at a Boston TV station. ``It was only his
self-destructive drinking that ever concerned us.''
   Eaton and Phillip Coleman, also a gay, recovering
alcoholic-addict, moved in together in 1983. According to Eaton's
Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor, Skip B., they were very happy and
Eaton was sober until Coleman died of AIDS in November 1987.
   By then, Eaton knew he had AIDS-related complex, a condition that
includes some of the symptoms of AIDS but not life-threatening
cancers or infections that take advantage of the body's weakened
immune system.
   ``Phil's death really devastated Joey,'' said Skip B., who took
in Eaton until he passed out with a lit cigarette and started a fire
in Skip's home. On Nov. 12, Eaton was told to move out and he became
one of the city's estimated 6,000 homeless.

<HEAD>Passport for Walesa Aide Likely, Spokesman Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Tuesday it is changing
its attitude toward Solidarity founder Lech Walesa and indicated one
of his main advisers could accompany him to France.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said the reply ``may be
positive'' to the passport application of historian Bronislaw
Geremek.
   President Francois Mitterrand of France has invited Walesa,
winner of the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize, to attend observances Saturday
of the 40th anniversary of the Declaration of the Universal Rights
of Man.
   Walesa was told last Saturday he could make the trip but he
wanted Geremek, whose specialty is French medieval history and who
speaks fluent French, to accompany him.
   Geremek said Sunday that he had been refused a passport on all
five recent occasions when he applied.
   Adam Michnik, another Walesa adviser, said from Gdansk on Tuesday
that Walesa planned to leave Friday and return Sunday.
   It would the first time authorities have granted Walesa a
passport since the free trade union was suppressed and outlawed
after the imposition of martial law in December 1981.
   Permission for the trip coincided with signs of a more positive
feeling toward Walesa by authorities.
   ``There has been a change of attitude toward Walesa,'' Urban
confirmed at his news conference.
   Citing Walesa's statements during a Nov. 30 nationally televised
debate with official unions chief Alfred Miodowicz, and his public
statements since, Urban said it was ``a different Lech Walesa than
the one who in past years many times spoke in a confrontational
spirit.''
   ``Is this new Walesa, growing to be a partner, going to be
stable? Is he going to keep this tone which dominated his television
statements? I think yes,'' Urban said.
   In another development, Solidarity spokesmen said Walesa was
allowed to address about 4,000 students Monday night in an unusual
meeting in a Gdansk University lecture hall and answer questions
about his debate with Miodowicz.
   The meeting was organized by the banned but active Independent
Students Association, roughly the campus equivalent of Solidarity,
and was attended by some university officials, said Michnik.
   Walesa was quoted by Solidarity spokesman Robert Kozak as telling
the students: ``Many interesting things are happening now. May Poles
really reach agreement and find a place for themselves.''

   Federal and local trouble-shooters watched
Mikhail Gorbachev's arrival Tuesday on a video screen in a darkened,
vaultlike room at Police Headquarters, which has been turned into a
command center for his visit.
   ``It's an assembly of people who are problem-solvers,'' said
Deputy Inspector James Vitti. ``The premise is that we have one
location where people who can speak for their agencies are available
to cope with any potential problem that may develop.''
   More than 20 agencies, including the FBI, the Secret Service, the
Coast Guard, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Fire
Department, the city's traffic department and its ambulance corps
were represented.
   Two long tables with banks of telephones and a 26-foot-by-10-foot
video screen dominated the room. One side panel of the screen
contained a slide of Time Magazine's ``Man of the Year'' cover that
depicted the Soviet leader.
   In the middle panel, television coverage of Gorbachev's arrival
alternated between local stations and Cable News Network.
   ``We would define success as having nothing to do for the next
three days,'' Vitti said.
   But the command center, which is in constant contact with agents
and officers in the field, was called upon at least three times
before Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, were safely delivered to the
Soviet Mission in Manhattan from Kennedy International Airport.
   The first call came before their arrival when motorists on the
Long Island Expressway became impatient with detours and drove up on
the grass to avoid roadblocks.
   This problem went to police officials who dispatched extra
patrols to turn back the motorists.
   Another traffic problem arose on the Van Wyck Expressway in
Queens when a propane truck broke down in a lane that was to be
closed for Gorbachev's motorcade.
   The representative for the city Transportation Department at the
command center ordered the immediate dispatch of a tow truck, which
removed the disabled vehicle 10 minutes before Gorbachev left the
airport.
   As the motorcade traveled down the Grand Central Parkway in
Queens, another call came in to the command center _ a private
helicopter hired by a news organization was hovering too close to
the procession of 45 cars.
   The FAA representative notified the closest air control tower and
the helicopter was told to pull back.
   When the motorcade pulled into the Soviet Mission, police Lt.
Vincent Kennedy said: ``As an old friend of mine used to say, it
went like ice cream. No problems.''

<HEAD>Prosecutors Try New Tack To Keep North From Disclosing Secrets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran-Contra prosecutors sought Tuesday to
foreclose Oliver L. North's ability to disclose government secrets
at trial by conceding that some covert operations financed by
Iranian arms sales were legal.
   The concessions were made in memoranda filed at the request of
U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, who is conducting closed
hearings on the use of classified documents at a public trial.
Declassified versions of the briefs were unsealed late Tuesday in
U.S. District Court.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh said he would not offer
proof that North approved a variety of expenditures from the secret
fund that was amassed from the sale of U.S. weapons to Iran.
   The prosecutor said he wouldn't offer evidence about payments to
Drug Enforcement Administration agents to help free American
hostages in Lebanon. Nor would there be proof that North approved
$200,000 in payments to Nicaraguan rebel leaders, the spending of
$320,000 to buy a Danish ship used for a variety of clandestine
operations and $100,000 to buy radios for a foreign political group
not specified in the indictment.
   Walsh said he was ``willing to concede, for the purposes of this
case, that this group of expenditures went to programs otherwise
lawful, but not within the Iran finding'' in which President Reagan
approved the arms sales to make contact with moderate elements of
Iran and to free U.S. hostages.
   ``The government will concede for the purposes of this trial that
none of the expenditures went to programs which were themselves
illegal, except those for the support of the military and
paramilitary activities of the Contras,'' Walsh said.
   As a result of these concessions, ``the government maintains that
the use of classified documents to demonstrate the bona fides of the
programs supported by certain of the proceeds of the Iranian arms
sales is unjustified in light of the government's theory of the
case,'' Walsh said.
   The concessions were made after Reagan stated last week that his
administration would not allow public disclosure of virtually any of
the secret material that North wants to use to defend the charge he
conspired to defraud the government.
   White House refusal to release 40,000 pages of documents sought
by North and sensitive material censored from 395 documents Walsh
plans to use as prosecution exhibits threatens to scuttle the
central charges against the former National Security Council aide.
   The indictment charges that North and arms dealers Albert Hakim
and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord sold U.S. arms to
Iran at an inflated price to create profits, from which more than
$14 million was diverted to the Nicaraguan rebels. Also indicted is
former national security adviser John M. Poindexter. The four are to
be tried separately.
   Gesell is holding secret hearings on North's requests to disclose
certain classified information at the trial. The Classified
Information Procedures Act provides for dismissal of charges if the
government refuses to release documents that are needed for a fair
trial.
   Of particular concern to the Reagan administration is any
information about efforts to free Americans held in Lebanon by
pro-Iranian groups. Walsh said earlier this year that release of
such information could expose hostages and others to torture or
death.
   By making the concessions that he did, Walsh apparently hopes to
narrow the focus of the case against North, thereby reducing the
defense's need to disclose classified information to defend the
charge that the former presidential aide illegally diverted
U.S.-Iran arms-sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Walsh contended his concessions don't undermine the basic thrust
of his case against North.
   ``The crime charged ... is North's participation in a conspiracy
by which he fraudulently obtained control through his official
position, but without governmental accountability, over funds
generated by a United States government initiative,'' Walsh said.
   ``Because this is the crime charged, it is irrelevant ... whether
he then exercised his control in order to fund what the government
will concede are valid projects,'' he said.
   ``The crime lies in the control that North deceitfully obtained
and maintained over those funds. The allegations of expenditures
directed by North are relevant only on the issue of control.''
   ``North's crime lies in how he acquired and maintained control of
these funds, not in the specific purposes for which he spent them,''
Walsh said.
   No date has been set for North's trial. Secord, Hakim and
Poindexter will be tried separately after North's case is concluded.

   A report released a U.S. human rights group
Tuesday criticized Israel for imprisoning Palestinians without trial
and ``inhumane'' conditions at a prison camp in the Negev Desert.
   The Lawyers Committee For Human Rights, based in New York City,
compiled its 95-page report after fact-finding missions to Israel
and the occupied territories. Its representatives heard testimony
from Palestinian lawyers and human rights workers, and interviewed
Israeli officials.
   Among cases cited in the report is the detention in recent months
of four Palestinian field workers for Al Haq, a human rights group
in the occupied West Bank, and two lawyers from the occupied Gaza
Strip.
   All four were placed under administrative detention, an emergency
measure allowing for detention of up to six months without charges
or trial. The two lawyers have been released.
   ``The administrative detention ... is a serious blow to
independent human rights monitoring in the West Bank,'' the report
said.
   It also outlined abuses in the Ketziot prison, where thousands of
Palestinians have been detained during the year-old Palestinian
revolt against Israeli rule in the occupied territories.
   About 2,500 Palestinians are believed held in Ketziot, 1,500
under administrative detention.
   ``Ketziot's location in a remote part of Israel proper, its
extremely harsh desert climate and its crowded, inhumane living
conditions combine to create an untenable environment in which to
maintain long-term detainees,'' the report said.
   At Ketziot, Arabs are routinely forced to stand in the sweltering
desert heat for hours, water supplies are inadequate and prisoners
are sometimes beaten, it said.
   Ketziot inmates made similar complaints when an Associated Press
reporter visited the prison in June.
   Detention in Israel of residents of the occupied territories
violates the Fourth Geneva Convention, which states that detainees
in an occupied country may not be moved to another country, the
report contended.
   It quotes Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, the army chief of staff, as
saying Ketziot's location may be a ``contradiction'' of the Geneva
Convention, but Israel has ``the right to transfer prisoners into a
sovereign part'' of the country.
   Shomron also is quoted as saying the army is trying to improve
conditions at the prison, but ``It's not a hotel.''
   The Lawyers Committee for Human Rights was established in 1978
and has investigated human rights abuses in more than 25 countries.
This report was written by the executive director, Michael Posner,
and Virginia Sherry.

<HEAD>Opposition to Contest Roh's Choice of Premier</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The main opposition party said Tuesday
it would contest President Roh Tae-woo's choice for premier.
   The Party for Peace and Democracy led by Kim Dae-jung said it
would oppose National Assembly confirmation of Kang Young-hoon
because Roh did not consult the legislature about the appointment.
   Kim's party does not have enough votes to block approval and
would need the support of other opposition parties.
   Roh named Kang and 19 new ministers Monday in a shake-up prompted
by a political crisis over demands that former President Chun
Doo-hwan, Roh's predecesor, be made to account for human rights
abuses and corruption during his tenure.
   Roh said the appointments were among several measures to cut his
ties with Chun's authoritarian regime, but critics called the
changes insufficient. A similar reorganizaion is expected in the
governing Democratic Justice Party.
   National Assembly hearings into the suppression of a 1980
uprising in the southern city of Kwangju, in which hundreds of
people were killed, resumed Tuesday with legislators questioning
witnesses on who was responsible. Chun and Roh were senior generals
at the time.
   Officials said privately Tuesday the government plans to limit
the functions of the Defense Security Command to keep the powerful
military agency out of civilian affairs. They said the Agency for
National Security Planning, the government's main intelligence
organization, would be streamlined and barred from political
surveillance.
   Past rulers of South Korea have used the Defense Security Command
as a political tool. Chun was head of the command when he seized
power in 1980.
   Kang, the designated prime minister, paid a courtesy call Tuesday
on Kim, but the opposition leader said the party already had decided
to challenge the confirmation.
   Kim's party claimed Roh violated the Constitution by naming a
Cabinet along with a premier. Party officials said Roh should have
selected only a premier, who in turn would choose a Cabinet.
   The Constitution says a Cabinet should be formed after the
National Assembly confirms the premier, but naming both at the same
time has been common in recent years.
   Chun went into rural exile in a remote Buddhist monastery last
month after apologizing to the nation for abuses while in power. He
left office in February.
   Roh opposes efforts to punish Chun and asked the nation to
forgive the former president.

   Cold, wet weather dominated the Northwest on Tuesday, but the
upper Midwest had record warmth.
   A cold front moved across the Northwest, producing rain, freezing
rain and snow.
   Rain extended over the northern Pacific Coast through the
morning, changing to freezing rain across eastern Washington, the
Idaho Panhandle and western Montana, with rain changing to snow at
higher elevations.
   Snow showers extended over central New England, and rain was
scattered from north-central Texas into south-central Oklahoma.
   Record high temperatures for the date included 40 at Duluth,
Minn., and 46 at Marquette, Mich. Madison, Wis., tied its record of
53, which has been on the books since 1879.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 19
degrees at Limestone, Maine, to 80 at Fort Myers, Fla. Tuesday
morning's official low was 7 degrees below zero at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Wednesday, snow showers were forecast from the northern and
central Rockies into western South Dakota, and over Upper Michigan.
Scattered rain was forecast from central Texas across north-central
Texas.
   Highs in the teens were predicted from northern Minnesota into
eastern North Dakota; in the 20s and 30s in northern Maine, the
upper Great Lakes, the remainder of the upper half of the
Mississippi Valley, the upper two-thirds of the Plains and the
Rockies; in the 40s and 50s from central Maine across New Jersey,
the Appalachians, the lower Great Lakes, the Ohio Valley, the
Tennessee Valley, from southeastern Missouri across northern
Arkansas, Oklahoma, northern Texas, and the northern half of the

   A woman without ovaries gave birth to a
baby produced from her egg and her husband's sperm, a medical
advance that offers hope to women who might otherwise be infertile,
doctors said Tuesday.
   The 6-pound, 5-ounce baby girl, Laure, was born Monday in this
Alpine city to a 37-year-old woman who asked to be identified only
as Aline to protect her family's privacy.
   ``I'm so happy, I was without hope,'' she told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview from her bed at the Hopital Sud.
   French doctors said the birth was the first time a woman without
ovaries delivered a baby conceived from her own egg.
   Other women without ovaries have carried babies to term, but in
the past the infant was produced from the egg of a donor. Aline's
egg was fertilized in a laboratory dish by her husband's sperm, the
resulting embryo was frozen and implanted 10 months later in her
uterus.
   The birth represents a major medical advance because it means
biological ``motherhood is still possible for young women who have
no ovaries or for leukemia patients, for example, whose ovaries have
been irrevocably damaged by radiation or chemotherapy,'' Dr. Nicole
Quenard said.
   The doctor, who attended delivered Laure by Caesarean section,
called the birth ``very moving for everyone.''
   She said the surgical delivery was necessary for reasons not
related to the conception.
   Aline first consulted the fertility specialists at Hospital Sud
in the spring of 1985. She was in pain and had been unable to
conceive.
   Aline had lost an ovary years before to infection and doctors at
Hopital Sud discovered she suffered from advanced endometriosis, a
condition in which uterine tissue grows outside the womb.
   In Aline's case, the endrometriosis had surrounded her remaining
ovary. When she did not respond to medication, doctors decided to
remove the ovary.
   Before the ovary was removed, doctors extracted four eggs and
fertilized them with Aline's husband's sperm. Four embryos resulted,
and two were implanted in Aline's uterus. No pregnancy resulted.
   On Dec. 14, 1987, doctors removed Aline's remaining ovary and
Fallopian tubes, leaving her uterus. Three months later, the
remaining embryos were implanted in Aline's uterus, and Laure's
birth was the result.

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev got his
first look at New York on Tuesday during a 40-minute motorcade ride
through the city to the privacy of the Soviet Mission to the United
Nations, a luxury high-rise on the posh Upper East Side of Manhattan.
   If he carried a surprise proposal, as some advisers hinted,
Gorbachev kept the secret to himself.
   The Soviet leader, accompanied by his closest foreign policy
advisers, prepared to address the United Nations on Wednesday and to
meet with President Reagan and President-elect George Bush.
   Soviet officials were close-mouthed about details of Gorbachev's
schedule but hinted he was bringing some surprises on his second
visit to the United States, which comes almost a year to the day
after the summit meeting in Washington at which he and Reagan signed
a treaty to eliminate a class of nuclear weapons.
   The Soviet leader, accompanied by his wife, Raisa, and key
advisers, arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport and
stepped from his special Aeroflot Ilyushin jet precisely on schedule
at 3 p.m. after a direct flight from Moscow.
   In brief remarks at the airport, Gorbachev said the Soviet Union
``intends to broaden and expand its cooperation within the United
Nations framework with all the states that make up the United
Nations.''
   ``We are living in a world that is going through some very
crucial changes, and we all _ all nations _ have their own concerns,
their own interests. We shall be sharing our interests in analyzing
and thinking over the current situation,'' he said.
   On the topic of the meeting with Reagan and Bush, the Soviet
leader said, ``We have not arranged any formal agenda, so either
side will be free openly and frankly to raise any questions that it
wishes to.''
   The American side, however, has shown no inclination to try to
negotiate any complex new agreements as Reagan moves off the world
stage and Bush prepares to take over.
   Gorbachev nonetheless brought along his top foreign policy
advisers, including Alexander Yakovlev, a former ambassador to
Canada and member of the Communist Party's ruling Politburo who
recently took charge of the international affairs portfolio in the
party Central Committee.
   Yakovlev is among those closest to Gorbachev and is regarded as
an architect of his plan to reallocate Soviet resources from defense
and foreign aid to improving domestic life.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze also accompanied
the president to New York, as did Anatoly Dobrynin, the longtime
Soviet ambassador to the United States who recently retired from his
Central Committee post but remains a Gorbachev adviser.
   Gorbachev predicted his meetings in New York ``will doubtless
promote greater dialogue and an expansion of cooperation between our
two countries.''
   Noting that he intends to have a full schedule here before going
on to Havana on Friday, Gorbachev said, ``We will have some other
meetings with some public and business circles in this country and
representatives of other countries. I trust these will be useful and
fruitful days. We are certainly prepared to make our contribution to
that end.''
   Soviet officials have predicted for days he would be presenting
some new ideas during the visit to New York, the first leg of a
nine-day trip that also will take him to Havana and London before he
returns to Moscow Dec. 14. But they have provided few details, even
keeping details of his schedule private.
   Reporters from the United States and other Western countries
searched the halls of the U.N. Secretariat Building in vain Tuesday
afternoon for Soviet officials to answer questions concerning news
and photographic pools and such questions as whether Gorbachev
planned to give a news conference during his stay in New York.
   No Soviet spokesman was available in Conference Room 2, the hall
the Soviets chose for their press briefings, and the telephone lines
were constantly busy at the Soviet mission to the United Nations.
   One official, however, told reporters at a U.N. news conference
that Gorbachev wants ``to take as many bites as possible out of the
Big Apple.''
   Andrei Grachev, an official of the Communist Party Central
Committee's Ideology Department said the schedule would be a
``Christmas surprise.''
   New York police said the Gorbachevs would visit the Observation
Deck of the World Trade Center, the city's tallest building, on
Wednesday and would drive past the Stock Exchange and through the
Broadway area. Opening a Soviet export show, viewing European
paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and visiting Central
Park are on the schedule for Thursday.
   Police said Mrs. Gorbachev might also visit a department store.

   Police entered a church
sanctuary Tuesday night and halted a peaceful service dedicated to
black anti-apartheid activists convicted of treason and terrorism.
   The Rev. Allan Boesak was addressing about 1,000 people at the
Central Methodist Church in downtown Johannesburg when more than two
dozen policemen walked in and canceled the service.
   Police formed a wall between the pulpit and the audience, which
had turned out in support of the 11 activists convicted last month.
   ``This government does not know justice and does not have a
vision of peace,'' Boesak said before police intervened. ``A
government that can only depend on the barrel of a gun ... is not a
legitimate government.''
   The Rev. Peter Storey, minister of the church, said police
declared the service an illegal gathering.
   Storey led a brief prayer, then asked the audience to leave
``quietly and with dignity.'' The multiracial crowd departed without
incident.
   ``The police said they wanted to talk to me, but I told them I
had nothing to say to them,'' Boesak said outside the church.
   During a fiery speech that drew repeated applause, Boesak praised
the convicted activists as peaceful men and condemned South Africa's
justice system.
   ``We now hear that to oppose apartheid is treason, to work for
justice is terrorism,'' Boesak said.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   Organizers of the service originally had planned a rally at a
nearby university. But when Police Commissioner Gen. Hendrik de Witt
on Tuesday banned all protest meetings related to the case,
organizers decided to hold the prayer service.
   A hearing began Monday in Pretoria to determine the sentences for
the activists, who include three senior leaders of the now-banned
United Democratic Front, the country's largest anti-apartheid group.
   U.S. Sens. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and David Boren, D-Okla., attended
the hearing Monday but issued no public statements. No hearing was
held Tuesday, but it was to resume Wednesday.
   The trial began in 1985 in the small farming town of Delmas and
later was shifted to Pretoria. Eleven of the orginal 22 defendants
were acquitted at various stages.
   The trial judge, Kees van Dijkhorst, ruled that the United
Democratic Front was a revolutionary organization which collaborated
with the outlawed African National Congress to incite
anti-government violence in 1984. Boesak, Anglican Archbishop
Desmong Tutu, the Nobel laureate, and other front supporters were
named as unindicted co-conspirators.
   The three best-known defendants in the trial, all convicted of
treason, are Popo Molefe, 36, who was the front's national
secretary; Terror Lekota, 40, its publicity secretary; and Moses
Chikane, 40, secretary of its Transvaal Province branch.
   The maximum penalty for treason and terrorism is death, but van
Dijkhorst is expected to impose prison terms when the sentencing
hearing ends, possibly this week.
   Several of the country's leading anti-apartheid figures testified
Monday on behalf of the defendants.
   After the treason verdicts were delivered last month, the U.S.
State Department criticized the proceedings, saying the defendants
were convicted of activities that would be accepted in any
legitimate democracy.

   Inmates held a prison warden hostage
Tuesday night after fighting broke out among 300 convicts at the
maximum security unity of a prison, police said.
   Five prisoners were reported wounded by gunfire and eight were
injured in the rioting at the Guyama Regional Prison, 51 miles south
of San Juan.
   Prison officials were negotiating with inmates, who took the
warden hostage during the rebellion. It was not immediately known
what the inmates wanted in exchange for releasing the warden,
identified as Roberto Sanchez.
   About 100 riot police surrounded the prison while negotiations
took place.
   Police Capt. Paulino Rodriguez Fonseca said the fighting started
when two prison gangs clashed in the prison's maximum security ward.
   The injured, suffering from gunshot wounds, burns and broken
bones, were being treated at area hospitals.
   ``This was a horrible rebellion,'' said Rodriguez.
   He said fighting flared at around 3:50 p.m. when one gang tried
to break into the new maximum security section of the prison where
another gang was being held.
   He said many inmates went on a rampage and set fire to part of
the prison. A wing of the prison appeared gutted.

<HEAD>Charges Filed In Universal Studios Slayings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Murder charges calling for the death penalty
were filed Tuesday against an escaped psychiatric patient accused of
shooting two guards at Universal Studios after demanding to see
actor Michael Landon.
   According to witnesses, Nathan Nicholas Trupp, 42, apparently had
delusions that Landon, star of the ``Highway to Heaven'' television
series, was a Nazi.
   Trupp was charged with first-degree murder in the slaying of
Jeren Beeks and Armando Torres, and one count of attempted murder
stemming from the shootout he had with sheriff's deputies after the
slayings. Trupp was wounded by deputies.
   ``The motive is not robbery,'' said Deputy District Attorney
Sterling Norris, who filed the charges. ``It is that he believed
that he was killing Nazis.''
   Norris said Trupp believed not only that Landon was a Nazi, but
also three people authorities say were slain by Trupp in an
Albuquerque, N.M. bagel shop on Nov. 29.
   The charges allege a multiple murder special circumstance, which
permits a possible death penalty if Trupp is convicted.
   Tests indicated the .38-caliber handgun used in the Universal
Studios shootings was the same weapon used in the bagel shop
killings, authorities said.
   Trupp, who had lived off and on in Albuquerque since August 1987,
walked away from a supervised boarding house for the mentally ill in
Trenton, N.J., April 5, 1987, after being involuntarily committed
for state psychiatric care.
   Trupp allegedly shot the Universal guards Thursday after
demanding to see or talk by telephone to Landon. The guards declined
to let Trupp use the telephone in their shack to call Landon.
   Trupp was scheduled for arraignment Tuesday afternoon, but
prosecutors said beforehand that Trupp was not well enough. The
hearing later was continued to Dec. 13.

   Four Navy fliers were presumed lost at sea after
their electronic warfare plane failed to return from a training
mission and a search proved fruitless, officials said Tuesday.
   The names of the crewmen were withheld pending notification of
their families, Navy spokesman Lt. Gordon Hume said.
   Several pieces of debris were spottted in the search area 900
miles off the San Diego coast but they sank before they could be
recovered, said Hume. The search was called off Monday evening.
   The Grumman-made EA-6B ``Prowler'' took off from the aircraft
carrier USS Constellation on a nighttime training exercise at 11:09
p.m. PST Sunday. It was declared overdue at 2:13 a.m. Monday,
prompting a sea and air search for the twin-engine jet, Navy
spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Bob Pritchard said.
   The aircraft was lost in an area of open sea where there was no
place to land in an emergency.
   The plane was assigned to an electronic warfare squadron based at
the Whidbey Island (Wash.) Naval Air Station. It was accompanying
the San Diego-based Constellation on a six-month deployment to the
western Pacific. The carrier left San Diego last Thursday, said
Pritchard.
   The EA-6B, which costs about $22 million, is intended for use by
the Navy in airborne electronic warfare and carries equipment
capable of jamming enemy radar, he said.

   A gasoline tank truck collided with a
Conrail locomotive at a road crossing and burst into flames Tuesday,
killing the truck driver, destroying two houses and leaving 15
people homeless, authorities said.
   An 80-foot plume of flame from the tanker burned for an hour
before being brought under control by about 100 firefighters, said
Carteret Fire Superintendent Richard Greenberg.
   ``The gas was flowing all over the place, catching fire,'' said
police Sgt. Ron Bennett.
   Driver Enrique Cosme, 53, of Elizabeth, was killed instantly when
the tanker ran into one of two joined locomotives crossing an
industrial section of tracks about 6 a.m., Bennett said.
   The crossing has no warning system, officials said. When trains
need to cross the junction, a crew member gets out and signals to
oncoming traffic.
   Conrail spokeswoman Pat Linskey in Philadelphia said a train
worker saw no traffic and radioed the locomotives to proceed.
   He then saw the truck and ``waved a flare and the truck continued
to advance and the accident happened,'' she said. None of the three
Conrail crewmen was injured.
   The 9,000-gallon capacity truck, which had just been filled at a
Shell Oil Co. depot, spilled about 4,000 gallons on the road and
into sewers, culverts and the grounds of two factories.
   The fire spread to several buildings in the lightly populated
industrial area, destroying two homes _ a four-family dwelling and a
single-family unit. Two buildings from the nearby FMC chemical
manufacturing company and a third home also were damaged.
   A half-mile wide stream of black smoke from the blaze reached
across the Arthur Kill waterway toward New York. The state
Department of Environmental Protection told residents of
northeastern New Jersey and New York City to take precautions
against heavy breathing as the smoke moved into the area. It
dissipated by noon.
   A small but undetermined amount of fuel spilled into the
waterway, which separates New Jersey from Staten Island, but
officials said there appeared to be no major contamination.
   Three people were admitted to hospitals for observation and
released, Greenberg said.
   The tanker truck was owned by Island Transportation of
Woodbridge. An employee who answered the telephone at the company
said officials had no comment. He refused to identify himself.
   The area remained closed to traffic until late in the afternoon,
while about 40 workers from the Middlesex County Hazardous Materials
Emergency Response Unit and Clean Venture of Perth Amboy, an
environmental cleanup company, recovered the spilled fuel with
suction equipment.

   Scores of protesters gathered Tuesday night near
the Soviet mission where Mikhail Gorbachev is staying to vent their
displeasure at the Soviet leader's policies on Armenians and Jews.
   With speeches, songs and chants, the demonstrators made their
positions known, but got no apparent response from anyone at the
mission a half-block away in a fashionable section of Manhattan's
East Side.
   ``Gorbachev stop the massacres,'' chanted several hundred
American-Armenians, referring to reports of atrocities against
Armenians in Azerbaijan.
   Across from the placard-waving Armenians stood a handful of
placard-waving Jews calling for improved human rights for Jews in
the Soviet Union.
   ``We hope the light of Hanukkah penetrates the darkness of Soviet
Russia,'' said Glenn Richter, an organizer of the demonstration by
the Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry.
   Rabbi Avraham Weiss, addressing the gathering of about 20 people,
said ``We're here for the hundreds of thousands denied permission to
leave the Soviet Union. We're here for all of those who died waiting
for exit visas.''
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., who came to the Armenian rally at
the request of the organizers, said, ``We want to let the Soviets
know that we are concerned about human rights.''
   Long-simmering racial antagonisms in the southern Soviet
republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan have surfaced under Gorbachev's
twin policies of perestroika and glasnost, or restructuring and
openness, forcing the Kremlin to impose a virtual state of martial
law there.
   Lautenberg said Western reporters and the Red Cross should be
allowed in the region ``and tell us the truth about what's
happening.''
   ``In Azerbaijan and the area called the Karabakh, Armenians are
assaulted, their homes have been invaded, families have been in some
cases raped,'' Lautenberg said. ``We want to know the true facts.''
   The Soviet leader, accompanied by his closest foreign policy
advisers, arrived in New York City on Tuesday for a two-day visit
that includes an address to the United Nations on Wednesday. Later,
he is to meet with President Reagan and President-elect George Bush.

   Hundreds of inmates rioted when a
gang war broke out at a southern Puerto Rico penitentiary on
Tuesday, and prisoners took the warden hostage, police said. At
least 13 inmates were reported injured.
   Five inmates were wounded by gunfire and eight others were
injured during the riot involving 400 inmates of a maximum-security
unit of the Guyama Regional Prison, about 51 miles south of San
Juan, police said.
   Part of the prison was set on fire and a wing appeared gutted by
the blaze.
   The violence was triggered by a clash between two gangs, said
police Capt. Paulino Rodriguez Fonseca.
   Prison officials were negotiating with inmates who took the
warden hostage during the rebellion. Prison officials said inmates
of one gang were demanding that members of the other gang be
transferred to another prison.
   Prison officials identified the warden as Roberto Sanchez.
   The injured, suffering from gunshot wounds, burns and broken
bones, were being treated at local hospitals.
   ``This was a horrible rebellion,'' said Rodriguez Fonseca.
   About 100 riot police surrounded the prison while negotiations
took place.
   Department of Corrections administrator Mercedes Otero said the
prison has a capacity of 1,000 but that only 774 prisoners were
jailed at the time of the riot.
   Rodriguez Fonseca said the rebellion flared at around 3:50 p.m.
(4:50 p.m. EST) when one gang tried to break into the new
maximum-security section of the prison where another gang was being
held.
   He said many inmates went on a rampage during the fighting and
set fire to part of the prison. A wing of the prison appeared gutted.
   Meanwhile, police reported two girls and an employee at the
Villalba Juvenile Home were injured after fighting broke out at the
girl's home, located in the central city of Villalba. Police also
reported a rebellion at another juvenile center in the southern city
of Ponce but there were no injuries.

<TEXT>
   The city wants to sell the home rebuilt on
the site of the bombed-out MOVE headquarters, but neighbors in the
area that burned in the 1985 battle between police and the radical
group want officials to come to terms with the former owner first.
   Louise James, sister of late MOVE founder John Africa, owned the
house, which was condemned by the city so the neighborhood could be
rebuilt. The city gave the rebuilt homes to all the residents except
Ms. James.
   Her suit against the city to recover the house, which is under
24-hour police guard, is pending in Common Pleas Court.
   While neighbors don't want Ms. James to get the house back, they
don't want it sold until the city can come to an agreement with her,
said one resident, Gerald Renfrow.
   ``She's not going to walk away with no money and no house, and
that's going to keep us in the middle of their fight,'' he said.
   Sixty-one houses were destroyed after police dropped a bomb on
the roof of the fortified MOVE row house in an effort to evict the
members. John Africa; Ms. James' son, Frank James Africa; and nine
others in the house died in the siege.
   The city Redevelopment Authority, which owns the house, plans to
meet Wednesday to arrange transfer to a city-controlled agency that
can arrange a sale without public bidding, officials said in Tuesday
editions of the Philadelphia Daily News.
   Carl Tobey Oxholm III, deputy city solicitor, said Monday the
city had no intention to sell Ms. Africa the house.
   Ms. James' attorney, Fincourt B. Shelton, said that if there's an
attempt to sell the house, ``we'll ask the court for a petition to
stay any attempt to sell the property. The property is the subject
of litigation.''

   A B-52 bomber crashed on a runway and
burst into flames during a training flight early Tuesday, sending
all eight crewmen to a hospital.
   The Strategic Air Command grounded its fleet of about 260 of the
aging planes as a precaution, said Maj. Suzanne Randle, public
affairs officer for SAC headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base in
Omaha, Neb.
   Another SAC spokesman, Lt. Col. George Peck, said the grounding
was lifted Tuesday evening, and that each B-52 will have its fuel
system inspected before being cleared to fly, some as early as
Wednesday.
   Randle had said earlier that she anticipated the fleet would be
back in the air in 24 hours. ``We don't lose many B-52s. It has been
a super plane,'' she said.
   The B-52 broke into three parts about 1:15 a.m. EST during
practice ``touch-and-go'' landings at K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base,
said Sgt. Naomi Siegal, a spokeswoman at the SAC installation here.
In a touch-and-go, the plane immediately takes off again rather than
slowing down.
   The practice landings followed a seven-hour training flight,
officials said.
   No weapons were aboard the plane, which is equipped to carry
nuclear bombs.
   The crew members crawled or were helped out of the front section
of the broken aircraft and none suffered burns, Senior Airman Tim
Sanders said.
   All aircraft exercises at Sawyer were canceled and runways were
closed, said a base spokeswoman, Tech. Sgt. Anita Bailey. Base
officials said the airfield would remain closed for at least a week.
The crashed jet was one of 20 B-52s stationed at Sawyer.
   ``We are counting our blessings. You can put parts of a plane
back together, but you cannot put people back together,'' Bailey
said. Only one crew member was in serious condition; one was under
observation but was uninjured.
   Lt. Col. George Peck, a spokesman for SAC headquarters, said
weather did not appear to be a factor in the crash. The National
Weather Service said a nearby municipal airport reported conditions
at 1 a.m. as clear with a temperature of 39 degrees.
   Peck said it was normal for B-52 crews to be on training flights
at that hour. ``Crews have to be trained to fly at any time of the
day or night in any weather,'' he said.
   Bailey said she did not know who was at the controls at the time
of the crash. Capt. Mark Hartney, 29, was the aircraft commander,
but 1st Lt. Michael S. Debruzzi, 26, also was qualified to fly the
plane, she said.
   Maj. William R. Kroeger, 52, an instructor pilot from Fountain
Hills, Ariz., was in serious condition at Marquette General Hospital
with chest injuries, said hospital spokeswoman Ann Parent. Three
other crewmen were in satisfactory or stable condition at the
hospital, she said.
   Three crewmen, including Hartney and Debruzzi, were moved to the
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base hospital in Dayton, Ohio, said
Airman 1sr Class Blakely Hicks.
   The eight-engine B-52, which was deployed in the early 1950s, is
the military's biggest bomber with a wingspan of 185 feet and a
maximum takeoff weight of 488,000 pounds. The last B-52 was
commissioned in 1962. The original cost of the aircraft was
$9,955,000, said Capt. Harry Edwards at SAC headquarters.
   Six crewmen died and 10 were injured Oct. 11 when an Air Force
tanker enroute from K.I. Sawyer crashed at Wurtsmith Air Force Base
near Oscoda, Mich. The Air Force's investigation of the crash is
incomplete.

   Atlantis streaked out of
orbit from its secret spy satellite mission Tuesday and glided to an
unusual afternoon landing as a small band of spectators cheered the
five astronauts' safe return.
   Navy Cmdr. Robert L. Gibson guided the 97-ton shuttle to a
centerline touchdown at 3:35 p.m. PST on a hard-packed clay runway
after a flight of 4 days, 9 hours, 5 minutes.
   ``They have been given the welcome back call,'' said Billie
Deason at Mission Control in Houston after the spaceship had rolled
to a halt on the 7.5-mile-long runway.
   Two loud sonic booms crackled overhead as Atlantis descended
through partly sunny skies and made its swooping approach to Rogers
Dry Lake in the Mojave Desert.
   One tire on the shuttle's left landing gear had a slow leak, but
NASA said it was not a concern. It certainly did not seem to affect
the smoothness of the touchdown, which was televised live by the
networks.
   About 55 minutes after landing, the crew emerged from the orbiter
and was greeted by NASA adminiistrators, and then inspected the
underside of the craft. ``Dings'' could be seen in the black
protective tiles,'' Ms. Deason said.
   The underside scarring shown by NASA cameras ``appeared to be a
lot more damaged than usual,'' said NASA spokeswoman Nancy Lovato.
   A white plume was seen coming from the right rear of Atlantis
during landing but Ms. Lovato said it was normal venting of vapor.
She did not know whether the vapor was water or chemical.
   ``It was a great flight, a super flight,'' NASA Administrator
James C. Fletcher said in a statement. ``It shows we can serve our
DOD (Department of Defense) customers as we have in the past.''
   It was only the seventh afternoon shuttle landing, the time
apparently dictated by the orbit Atlantis had to follow in deploying
a radar satellite to spy on the Soviet Union. NASA prefers morning
landings at Edwards because winds tend to gather force later in the
day.
   Because of the military secrecy, Tuesday's landing was closed to
public viewing from the observation site on this military base 80
miles north of Los Angeles. Only a few hundred journalists, NASA
employees and invited guests were witnesses.
   Scattered applause echoed across the hardpan in front of NASA's
main hangar as Atlantis rolled across the dry lakebed. The National
Anthem blared from a loudspeaker.
   In contrast, an estimated 425,000 people had watched Discovery
return Oct. 3 from the flight that put Americans back in space for
the first time since the Challenger tragedy.
   Ms. Deason said all systems performed normally during landing and
rollout. Tests of the new nose wheel steering system and brakes
proved successful, she said. Previous shuttles experienced brake
problems and before Challenger, shuttles were steered during landing
by applying brake pressure on one side of the orbiter or the other.
   Although NASA and the Air Force permitted live television
coverage of the landing, as they did for Friday's launch from Cape
Canaveral, Fla., everything in between was blacked out. Nothing was
heard during the flight from commander Gibson or crew members Col.
Richard M. Mullane, Lt. Col. Guy S. Gardner and Lt. Col. Jerry L.
Ross of the Air Force and Navy Cmdr. William M. Shepherd.
   NASA said Gibson would probably make brief remarks to the workers
at Edwards before the astronauts flew to Houston later in the
evening.
   Mission Control in Houston lifted its curtain of secrecy on the
flight just long enough to report, as it was happening, that Gibson
had fired braking rockets to slow the spaceship's 17,400-mph speed
by 283 mph and drop it out of orbit onto an hourlong fiery descent
through the atmosphere.
   The flight was the 27th shuttle mission and the second since the
1986 Challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts and halted
launchings for 32 months. It was the third flight for Atlantis and
the longest of the three shuttle missions that have been dedicated
entirely to military purposes.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration discovered a
slow leak in one of Atlantis' six tires before the spaceship was
launched. On Monday, the space agency issued a statement saying,
``The left inboard main landing gear tire pressure is not a concern
for landing.''
   Rear Adm. Richard Truly, a former astronaut in charge of the
shuttle program, called the current flight ``one of our most
important missions. It's Atlantis' first flight after the standdown,
and now you have two vehicles proven in flight. That's extremely
important.''
   While the mission was shrouded in secrecy, with no briefings by
officials on details of its progress, U.S. and Soviet news
organization reported the shuttle's classified payload was a
powerful spy satellite.
   Sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity said Monday that
the astronauts had successfully deployed the $500 million Lacrosse
satellite during the weekend, and that it was operating well in an
orbit that allows it to make radar pictures of 80 percent of the
Soviet Union.
   The satellite is said to be designed to help American
intelligence agencies monitor Soviet compliance with arms control
treaties, and also to serve as the ``radar eye'' for the new B-2
stealth bomber.
   The astronauts also were believed to have conducted several
experiments aimed at defining man's role as an observer in space.
   A NASA spokesman, asked the reason for the afternoon landing,
said he assumed it was required by the shuttle's orbit. To deploy a
spy satellite to fly over much of the Soviet Union would require a
high-inclination orbit in which Atlantis zig-zagged far north and
south of the equator as it circled Earth.
   After shuttles land at Edwards, they are towed off the lake bed
to the 100-foot-tall steel trusswork ``mate-demate device'' for
servicing, then several days later mounted on a modified jumbo
jetliner for a piggyback ride home to the Kennedy Space Center in
Florida.

   Soviet human rights activist Andrei Sakharov will
fly to Paris on Thursday, ending his outspoken first trip to the
United States with a quiet visit with his stepchildren, his
relatives said.
   The 67-year-old physicist and Nobel Prize winner, who arrived in
the United States Nov. 4, has been spending the last few weeks with
Efrem and Tatiana Yankelevich, the son-in-law and daughter of his
wife, Yelena Bonner.
   On Tuesday, a human rights group issued a statement from Sakharov
endorsing its call for U.N. observers to investigate ethnic unrest
in the Soviet republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia.
   ``I am deeply concerned with the situation that has emerged in
Azerbaijan and Armenia,'' Sakharov said in the statement issued by
the International League for Human Rights in New York.
   Sakharov came to the United States with the Soviet delegation to
a new organization, the International Foundation for the Survival
and Development of Humanity. He is a board member of the group,
which plans to sponsor research on global problems like arms
control, hunger, disease and pollution.
   Sakharov also traveled to New York and Washington, where he met
President Reagan on Nov. 14.
   During his stay, Sakharov underwent cardiovascular tests in
Boston, but doctors determined that he did not need a heart
pacemaker.
   The Yankeleviches, who live in the Boston suburb of Newton,
emigrated from the Soviet Union in 1977. Yankelevich said Sakharov
was flying to Paris on Thursday en route to Moscow.
   Sakharov, who helped develop the Soviet nuclear bomb, won the
1975 Nobel Peace Prize for his support of human rights in the Soviet
Union. He was banished to the industrial city of Gorky from 1980
through 1986 because of his outspoken opposition to Soviet
intervention in Afghanistan.
   Under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, however, Sakharov was
freed from internal exile and has been allowed to travel and speak
out on a wide range of topics.
   In Paris, he plans to attend a celebration of the 40th
anniversary of the United Nations' passage of a universal
Declaration of Human Rights on Dec. 10, 1948.

   Sailors past and present, history buffs, tourists
and others will gather Wednesday to mark the 47th anniversary of the
suprise Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that plunged the United
States into World War II.
   The National Park Service said it expects 1,000 people to mark
the fateful attack at its public ceremony on the harbor's shore and
another 5,000 to attend special programs throughout the day.
   ``Obviously, this being the 47th year, the ceremonies won't be as
big as for the 50th year,'' said media coordinator Dan Martinez.
``We're already planning for that anniversary, but every year is
important. There will be survivors here this year that might not
make it to the 50th.''
   The U.S. Navy planned a private ceremony aboard the USS Arizona
Memorial, which spans the sunken hull of the USS Arizona as a
tribute to the 1,177 men who went down with the ship. The Arizona
was one of 21 ships damaged or destroyed in the attack.
   The air attack on the Pearl Harbor naval base and other Hawaii
military installations left about 2,400 people dead and 1,200
wounded.
   At 7:55 a.m. HST (12:55 p.m. EDT), the moment the first bombs
fell on that Sunday morning, a moment of silence will be observed,
after which Hawaii Air National Guard jets will fly over in the
missing man formation.
   A Navy ship is to pass the memorial and wreaths and flowers will
be presented as the national anthem and Navy hymn are played.
   Adm. David E. Jeremiah, commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific
Fleet, is the scheduled keynote speaker at the Navy ceremony, with
his remarks to be followed by prayers, a 21-gun salute and Marine
Corps buglers playing ``Taps.''
   The speech was to be given by Adm. Huntington Hardisty, commander
in chief of the U.S. Pacific Command, but he became ill, a military
spokesman said late Tuesday.
   Forrest Biard, 75, a retired Navy captain who survived the
attack, was to be the keynote speaker at the Park Service ceremony.
   Biard, a former Navy code breaker, said President Reagan and
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev should remember Pearl Harbor as
they meet Wednesday in New York.
   ``We were both on the same side during World War II, but look
what's happened since then,'' said the Long Beach, Calif., resident.
``I hope they're working for peace as we're remembering war.''
   Gorbachev arrived in New York on Tuesday for informal talks with
Reagan and President-elect George Bush.
   On Sept. 7, in a speech before an American Legion gathering in
Louisville, Bush made a celebrated campaign flub when he reminded
the veterans _ erroneously _ that that day was the anniversary of
Pearl Harbor. ``We were hit and hit hard at Pearl Harbor. And we
were not ready,'' the vice president said.
   He later corrected himself, and the legionnaires gave him a
good-natured round of applause.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrived in New
York on Tuesday and said he hoped his luncheon discussions with
President Reagan and President-elect George Bush would lead to an
``expansion of cooperation'' between the superpowers.
   Gorbachev made his arrival statement in a sun-splashed ceremony
at Kennedy International Airport as U.S. officials said they were
preparing for the possibility of a ``grand gesture'' from the Soviet
leader to reduce troop strength in Eastern Europe.
   Gorbachev will blend diplomacy with sightseeing on a three-day
visit to the United Nations and New York. He said he hoped his
meeting with Reagan and Bush on Wednesday would ``serve the best
interests of the United States and the Soviet Union, indeed of all
the world.''
   ``We have not arranged any formal agenda so either side will be
free openly and frankly to raise any issues it wishes to,'' he said,
speaking through an interpreter.
   ``We are living in a world which is going through some very
crucial changes, and we all, all nations have their own concerns,
their own interests,'' Gorbachev said. ``We shall be sharing our
concerns and our interests in analyzing and thinking over the
current situation.''
   It was Gorbachev's second visit to the United States in a year,
and the fifth time he has arranged to sit down with Reagan. The two
leaders signed a historic arms reduction treaty during the
Washington summit last year.
   For his part, Bush was playing down his role in Wednesday's
luncheon session. He told a news conference in Washington he would
attend in his capacity as vice president, and without any of the
national security aides he has picked for his incoming
administration.
   On resolving the differences between the superpowers, Bush said,
``I will make it clear that we want to go forward, but I am not
going to be pressed into going beyond that prudent approach.''
   Last year, Gorbachev came to Washington. This time it was New
York, where some of the biggest headaches were caused by the
logistics of moving the general secretary's 45-car motorcade through
mid-town Manhattan.
   He will address the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday for the
first time.
   Arriving on the tide of his drive to shake up the Soviet
political system from top to bottom, Gorbachev sent advance word
that he may offer new proposals to end the Cold War, strengthen the
United Nations and improve the world's environment.
   An American official acknowledged the possibility of a ``grand
gesture,'' such as a reduction of Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia,
Hungary and Poland. ``It is plausible they would do it on the eve of
the opening of negotiations with the West and also as a public
relations move,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Such a move, in the absence of a similar move by the United
States, would reduce the Soviet advantage in conventional forces in
Europe and could facilitate an overal conventional force agreement
early in the Bush administration.
   The U.S. official told The Associated Press that the Soviets gave
no formal notification in advance of Gorbachev's visit of a troop
reduction. ``However,'' the official said, ``it is certainly on our
list of expectations.''
   It could be coupled, he said, with a restructuring of the Soviet
armed forces to make them ``leaner and meaner,'' putting more men on
reserve and fewer on active duty.
   Such a change could ease the burden defense spending is putting
on the hard-pressed Soviet economy. The effect on the West, the
official said, would be ``neither malign nor benign,'' meaning it
would be a change taken by the Soviets for their own military and
economic reasons.
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact are
expected to open talks on reducing troops, tanks and other
non-nuclear forces early next year.
   A Dutch radio station, Radio Netherlands World Service, reported
Tuesday that Gorbachev will offer to cut Soviet troop levels by 30
percent, or 140,000 soldiers. The report said that the Soviet
defense minister, Gen. Dmitri Yazov, had threatened to resign if the
offer were actually made.
   The Soviet news agency Tass, in a dispatch by a diplomatic
correspondent distributed shortly after Gorbachev left Moscow, said
the Kremlin leader ``intends to talk about important substantive
matters concerning real political cooperation between the two
countries on the broadest range of problems.''
   As the Kremlin leader headed to New York, Reagan was briefed by
Secretary of State George Shultz, Colin D. Powell, the national
security adviser, and other White House officials.
   Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze will
meet Wednesday, before the two presidents sit down for lunch.
   New York, in the throes of the Christmas shopping season,
provides an even wider audience for Gorbachev, and the Soviet leader
plans to do some sightseeing on Thursday.
   The Communist party leader's unabashed purpose is to persuade the
American business community that perestroika, or economic
reconstruction, of the Soviet Union is well-enough launched to hold
out the promise of a bigger trade relationship with America.
   U.S. officials said the Kremlin had notified them in advance that
apart from the speech Gorbachev's main purpose during the visit was
to persuade Reagan to lower American limits on trade and lending
with communist countries.
   The proposals could be implemented by greater access to American
stock and financial markets, as well as fewer limits on the ability
of organizations such as the Export-Import Bank and World Bank to
underwrite loans to the Soviet Union.
   Asked about this at Tuesday's White House briefing, presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said ``the Soviets have talked about
loosening trade restrictions in the past'' and said there has been
``no change'' in the U.S. position on this issue.
   He said ``that policy is that we support trade with the Soviet
Union in commercial areas and support loans for commercial,
non-strategic uses and have promoted joint ventures and things of
that sort.''
   But ``there are restrictions in a strategic sense,'' he said.
   Gorbachev, in four meetings with Reagan, has sought to slow the
nuclear arms race and to ease regional tensions by such moves as
withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, Vietnamese forces from
Cambodia, and Cubans from Angola.
   Reagan is seeking a renewed pledge from Gorbachev to meet the
Feb. 15 deadline for a total Soviet pullout from Afghanistan. The
Soviets announced a suspension last month, complaining about attacks
on the Red Army by U.S.-armed Afghan guerrillas.
   Last weekend, the Cuban withdrawal from Angola was unsettled by
an abrupt departure of South Africa from negotiations over an
overall settlement in Southwestern Africa.
   The State Department said Tuesday there have been significant
human rights improvements inside the Soviet Union under Gorbachev.
   But the department also said those improvements have been uneven
and marked by reversals and inconsistencies. And it said Moscow
remains in violation of the human rights provisions of the Helsinki
accords, in part because of its continuing occupation of Afghanistan.

   Israeli troops shot and wounded eight Arab
youths, including a 5-year-old boy, and Palestinians staged a
general strike Tuesday in solidarity with thousands of prisoners
jailed during their year-long uprising.
   The army, meanwhile, said it was opening an investigation into
the death Monday of a 15-year-old Gaza youth following allegations
she was shot deliberately at close range by a soldier.
   The girl, Asma Abu Obadah, of the Shati refugee camp in Gaza
City, was hit in the back of the head with a single plastic bullet
on her way home from school. The army said a patrol commander opened
fire to disperse a riot, but witnesses said the girl was shot at
close range after she panicked and ran.
   ``We are conducting investigations'' into the girl's death, said
an army official, who cannot be further identified under military
rules. ``We don't have results yet and don't expect anything
tonight.''
   The girl was the 319th Palestinian to die since the Palestinians
launched their uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied
territories on Dec. 8, 1987. Most have been shot in clashes with
Israeli troops. Eleven Israelis also have been killed.
   Seven Palestinians were reported wounded in clashes in the Gaza
Strip, and one in the West Bank.
   Among the victims in Gaza was 5-year-old Ahmed Bahassi, who was
shot in the chest in the Deir Balah refugee camp, doctors said.
Doctors at Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City said he was ``out of
danger'' after the bullet was removed.
   The army confirmed that the 5-year-old boy was wounded.
   ``In several riots, troops were attacked with stones, bricks and
other objects,'' an army spokesman said. ``The commander of an army
patrol had to fire plastic bullets, aiming at the rioters' legs, in
order to disperse them.''
   ``During the incident, no children were seen among the rioters.
The army is checking how and when the boy was injured,'' he said.
   Two teen-agers also were reported wounded by Israeli gunfire in
Deir Balah, and four others were hit in stone-throwing clashes in
the Khan Yunis and Bureij refugee camps and Gaza City.
   The army confirmed four casualties in Gaza.
   In the West Bank, 13-year-old Anwar Bhati from the village of
Shwakah was shot in the head when villagers threw stones to try to
block soldiers from entering and searching their homes, Arab
reporters said.
   Bhati was in guarded condition at Mukassad Hospital in Jerusalem,
where he underwent brain surgery. Dr. Rustom Namari, director of the
hospital, said the teen-ager was hit with a plastic bullet.
   ``We cleaned the wound, but we were unable to remove the bullet
because it was too deep,'' Namari said.
   An army spokesman confirmed the Shwakah wounding and three bullet
injuries in the Gaza Strip. He said no other details were available.
   The army has been using plastic bullets since last August for
riot control. The bullets have drawn criticism from the U.N. Relief
and Works Agency, which oversees aid to Palestinian refugees, and
foreign countries including the United States.
   Plastic bullets are not supposed to be lethal if fired from a
distance of 70 yards or more. But doctors say they can kill if fired
at close range or if they penetrate the head, chest or spine.
   The general strike was called to express solidarity with the
5,600 Palestinians in Israeli jails. It was the first of three
called this week by underground leaders of the Palestinian uprising.
Shutdowns Thursday and Friday are to mark the end of one year of
Palestinian revolt.
   Businesses were closed in most of the West Bank and Gaza, and
public transportation halted. A Jewish man was hospitalized after a
car he was driving was stoned near Bethlehem.
   In Nablus, dozens of Palestinians were treated Monday and Tuesday
for injuries from rubber bullets or beatings. The bullets, actually
rubber-covered metal pellets, generally do not penetrate the skin
but can cause bruising and broken bones.
   Also on Tuesday, police in Haifa said they uncovered a 10-member
squad of Israeli Arabs responsible for a grenade attack in the
coastal city last August in which 25 people were injured.
   Two of those arrested were Bedouin soldiers in the Israeli army,
and police said they suspect the squad planned to kidnap and kill
other soldiers. Bedouins and Druse are the only Arabs allowed to
serve in Israel's army.

   Defrocked evangelist Jim Bakker is
``wholly comfortable with the honorable character of the way
Heritage USA was operated under his leadership'' and will plead
innocent to fraud charges, his attorney said Tuesday.
   A federal grand jury on Monday indicted Bakker, founder of the
PTL ministries, and former aide Richard Dortch on charges of
diverting more than $4 million in PTL money to their own use. Each
was charged with eight counts of mail fraud, 15 counts of wire
fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud.
   A second 11-count indictment charged David Taggart, Bakker's
former personal aide, and Taggart's brother, James, with evading
nearly $500,000 in income taxes and diverting about $1.1 million of
PTL funds for personal expenses.
   Bakker's wife, Tammy, was not indicted.
   Although Bakker himself remained silent Tuesday on the charges,
his attorney, Jim Toms, said the former TV evangelist planned to
preach Sunday at his new church in a converted roller rink.
   Toms said his client would plead innocent to all of the charges
in the 24-count indictment. The indictment said Bakker, 48, and
Dortch, 57, engaged in a conspiracy designed to ``create and
continue lavish and extravagant lifestyles'' by defrauding
supporters who bought lifetime partnerships at PTL's Heritage USA
complex.
   The maximum penalty for each count is five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine, which means Bakker faces a possible sentence of 120
years in prison and $6 million in fines. Bakker and the other
defendants are scheduled to appear in court Dec. 15.
   Bakker and the Taggart brothers visited the federal courthouse in
Charlotte late Tuesday afternoon to pick up summonses ordering them
to appear in court.
   Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal Ray Abrams said the three were
photographed and fingerprinted and gave biographical information to
court officials to be used when bond is set next week. After about
two hours in the courthouse, Bakker left, eluding reporters by going
out a side door.
   ``I spent a good deal of time going over the text of the material
with him last night,'' Toms said in an interview from his
Hendersonville, N.C. office. ``It's going to take time now for him
just to study what's there and decide how we go about dealing with
it.''
   Toms said Bakker's emotional state was good, considering the
circumstances.
   ``I'd say he was relieved to see the specifics so he has a
problem he can start working on,'' he said. ``His faith in his
Christian vocation is unshaken and he is determained to do what he
needs to do to work his way through this.''
   Bakker ``has indicated he is wholly comfortable with the
honorable character of the way Heritage USA was operated under his
leadership and desires to see its ministry restored and continue,''
the attorney said.
   Bakker, who began the ministry in 1972, left it in disgrace in
March 1987 after admitting to a sexual encounter with church
secretary Jessica Hahn eight years earlier.
   After failing to regain control of PTL in bankruptcy proceedings
several months ago, the Bakker moved his newly formed Jim & Tammy
Ministries to a leased brick colonial building on the Yager Estate,
south of Charlotte. The Bakkers live in a 14-room log cabin on the
grounds.
   Friends and supporters dropped by the Bakkers' home throughout
the day as security guards kept reporters and photographers at a
distance.
   Supporters have erected a wooden manger with Christmas lights
outside the offices. A wooden angel was placed in a fountain by the
front door.
   ``The people are cheerful; they're hoping for the best,'' said
Darold Dotson, a former Bakker employee, after delivering a dozen
long-stem roses to the offices.

   President Reagan has lifted a six-year ban on
U.S. export of cluster bombs to Israel on the understanding that the
weapons will not be used against civilian targets, the State
Department said Tuesday.
   Reagan banned the sale of such munitions to Israel after that
country used them against civilian target areas in Lebanon in
violation of Israeli assurances to the United States, it was
announced at the time.
   ``Following a recently concluded understanding on the use of
cluster munitions, the president has determined that the ban on
their sale is no longer warranted,'' State Department press officer
Anita Stockman said Tuesday.
   ``Now that the issue of usage has been resolved pursuant to the
terms of the recent understanding'' barring use against civilians,
``we see no reason to prohibit Israel's access to these weapons
which can contribute to Israel's security,'' Ms. Stockman added.
   She noted that the United States sells to many other countries a
variety of cluster bombs and shells, which produce multiple
explosions and fragments on impact.
   Reagan's decision was denounced by Ambassador Clovis Maksoud, the
League of Arab Nations' representative in the United States, who
called it ``shocking,'' ``very provocative'' and ``sickening.''
   Maksoud said many maimed Lebanese and Palestinians ``bear witness
to Israel's reckless use of these weapons during the invasion of
Lebanon and Israel's repeated raids on Lebanese soil.''
   Maksoud added that the decision, coming after U.S. refusal of an
entry visa for Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat
to speak at the U.N. General Assembly, prompts people to ``wonder if
this latest provocation is a deliberate attempt to strain Arab
patience to the breaking point. Or is this sickening decision a
further departing vindictive shot against the Arab world and another
gift to Israeli rejectionists from the present administration?''
Maksoud asked.
   He added that regardless of such U.S. acts, the ``Palestinians'
commitment to reconciliation will stay the course'' charted last
month in the Palestine National Council declaration at Algiers.
   A New York-based Arab group, the American-Arab Relations
Committee of the National Council on Islamic Affairs, also denounced
the move.
   Committee President M.T. Mehdi said the decision will strengthen
Arab conviction that the United States is a ``permanent ally of
Israel and a permanent enemy of the Arab people.''
   He said that the ``Arabs cannot trust that Israel will not use
these bombs again.''

<HEAD>Newspaper: Gorbachev May Announce Politburo Cut in Conventional
Forces</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in his
United Nations address Wednesday, may announce a decision by the
ruling Politburo to make unilateral cuts in conventional forces
stationed in Eastern Europe and along the Chinese border, according
to a published report.
   The Washington Post, in its Wednesday editions, quoted
unidentified Soviet sources saying the Politburo approved the troop
cut following a shakeup in the ruling body Sept. 30.
   Announcement of major cuts in the Soviet armed forces would add
drama to Gorbachev's New York visit but not come as a big surprise
to U.S. officials.
   Gorbachev, who arrived in New York on Tuesday, was scheduled to
address the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday at 11 a.m. and then
eat lunch with President Reagan and President-elect George Bush.
   U.S. officials have been predicting for a year that Gorbachev
would sharply cut the Soviet armed forces, and many intelligence
analysts thought the announcement would come at the summit in Moscow
last summer.
   Such an announcement likely would give new momentum to
long-stalled talks on reducing Warsaw Pact and NATO conventional
forces in Central Europe, and to improve the atmosphere for a summit
scheduled next spring between Gorbachev and Chinese leader Deng
Xiaopeng. China has cut its own ground forces by one million over
the past four years, leaving it with about 4 million.
   The Soviet armed forces, according to U.S. government estimates,
number approximately 5.6 million.
   The Post quoted Soviet sources estimating the cuts at 20 percent.
Such a reduction would parallel cuts ordered in the mid-1950s by
then-Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, over protests from the armed
forces.
   Many Soviet generals are thought to oppose the cuts, which
Gorbachev and his allies have hinted at in a new doctrine of
``reasonable sufficiency.'' Such a doctrine would be based on
ability to repel aggression rather than to mount a massive offensive.
   The Soviet chief of staff, Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, said during
a visit to the Pentagon last July that he opposed any cut in Soviet
forces without a corresponding reduction in the conventional armies
kept in Western Europe by the United States and its allies in the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and other senior American
officials have said they would welcome such a change, but have seen
no indication of it in the deployment of Soviet forces.

   Ah, December. Time to turn on the television and
get set for those wonderful, warm-hearted holiday specials.
   But what's this? Pee-Wee Herman and Grace Jones? The Brady Bunch
with gray hair? John Denver schmoozing in upscale Aspen?
   It's not that bad, really. Selective viewers can pick through the
junk like so much wrapping paper to find some gems this month.
   For instance, Jason Robards and Julie Harris star in ``HBO
Showcase: The Christmas Wife,'' a different kind of Christmas story
about two lonely strangers. And for those who like holidays with
wry, there's ``Season's Greetings,'' a comedy on the Arts &
Entertainment Network written by British playwright Alan Ayckbourn.
On PBS, the King's Singers from England appear in concert with the
Kansas City Symphony in what promises to be a very special special.
   Here is a list of December holiday fare:

   MORE SETS, SETS ON MORE; OR, END OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION,
CONTINUED _ Americans average seven hours of television viewing a
day, or at least that's how long the average set is on, according to
a recent report by the A.C. Nielsen Co. Ten years ago, the set was
on an average of 6 hours and 13 minutes a day. In 1951, when only 9
percent of U.S. homes had televisions, the sets were on an average
of 4 hours and 43 minutes a day. Today, Nielsen estimates 904,000
U.S. households have televisions.

<HEAD>Military Chaplains Tread Fine Line Between Faith And Might</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military chaplain walks a fine line,
upholding religious principles of trust, peace and kindness in
organizations geared for the rigors of war.
   But leaders of these ministers in uniform say their work is
neither inconsistent nor compromised and religious ideals are all
the more important on a front of danger to them.
   ``Cooperation without compromise,'' reads the Army chaplains'
motto.
   ``We do ministry without compromise and without apology,'' says
Gen. Stuart A. Barstad, retiring this month after three years as Air
Force Chief of Chaplains.
   ``Peace movements should not think they have a corner on the
market,'' he adds. ``They are not the only ones interested in
peace.''
   Barstad and three other top U.S. military chaplains commented on
their roles in recent interviews with The Lutheran, monthly magazine
of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.
   Remarkably, all of them are clergyman of that denomination, as is
the nation's fifth top military chaplain, Army Col. Herbert B.
Cleveland, director of chaplain services for the Veterans
Administration.
   Altogether, they oversee work of about 13,000 military chaplains
and assistants of various faiths serving families of nearly 3
million members of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and
National Guard, besides veterans.
   The chaplaincy chiefs say they're carrying out full, undiluted
ministry in an environment that keenly needs it.
   ``The military has never asked me to hold back on my ministry or
my preaching,'' says Barstad, originally from Colfax, Wis.
   Maj. Gen. Norris Einertson, Army Chief of Chaplains, calls it a
``ministry of presence.''
   ``My parishioners (Army personnel) are contributing to peace in a
troubled world,'' he says. ``The military's first function is to
keep the peace, not make war.''
   Einertson, originally of Westbrook, Minn., adds, ``We are always
faced with alternatives. We are not being Christian if we allow the
rights of any to be trampled on by oppressors of the left or right.''
   He says American churches are not teaching Christians to think
critically about war and peace, resulting in their either approving
armed conflict indiscriminately or rejecting it as always wrong.
   Rear Adm. Alvin B. Koeneman, Navy Chief of Chaplains, concedes
the work involves some tensions, but these must be seen in light of
what Christianity says about the sinful nature of societies as well
as about peace.
   ``It's tough to talk about the peace of Jesus while working on an
ammunition ship,'' he says. ``But sailors live in that situation.
Someone needs to be there to live the contradiction with them and
wrestle with it.''
   Koeneman, originally from Omro, Wis., points out that unlike
hospital or prison chaplains who go home at night, in the military,
``you eat the same food'' as the personnel and live with them.
   ``If they're stuck in the mud, you're in the mud,'' he says. ``If
they're getting shot at, you're getting shot at. It's one thing to
talk with a sailor about being lonely, but another when you're both
a long way from home.''
   Col. Walter Hiskett, Marine Chief of Chaplains, was a wounded
combat veteran of the Korean war before entering the ministry and
then volunteering for his first tour of duty as a chaplain in
Vietnam.
   For that, he calls himself ``dumb-dumb,'' but adds, ``These
people deserve ministry. The thought of no chaplaincy, no ministry
to these people was unconscionable.''
   The chiefs point out that they advise command staffs on matters
of morale as well as religion and morals, thus exerting an influence
on military policy.
   They ``make an impact on the institution,'' says Barstad. ``The
military is part of our national structure. We must ask, `Do we want
to be represented there, and how best can we minister _ as insiders
or outsiders?''
   Says Koeneman: ``You can make a far more profound witness for
peace working within the system than you can carrying a placard or
throwing goats blood on some naval installation.''
   The chaplaincy chiefs say they often have presented church social
statements on peace and war to military leaders in the Pentagon.
   ``They want to know what the churches are saying,'' Einertson
said.
   Adds Barstad: ``The military is a very religious community. The
institution recognizes that the faith dimension is a crucial part of
life. There are many people here who are concerned about their
faith.''
   Einertson, referring to the chaplaincy's ecumenical setting among
those of various faiths or none, says the ``military stretched a
pastor more than any other environment.''
   Koeneman observes, ``It's not all brass bands and flags. There
have been times when I was depressed and wondered, `What's a nice
guy like me doing here?' But I knew. It was there to bring them a
word from the Lord.''

   Several industrialized nations agreed to lower
import barriers to tropical products like coffee, cocoa and bananas,
but wide gaps remain over the most contentious issues in a new round
of talks on free trade.
   Negotiators expressed pessimism Monday over the outlook for
accords on such controversial issues as farm subsidies, trade in
services and international protection of patents and copyrights.
   Cabinet ministers are meeting to give a political push to
negotiations at the midpoint of a four-year round of free-trade
talks that are the most ambitious since World War II.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s resolve to fight
looming criminal charges appears to be weakening and a possible
climax to its 2-year-old legal trauma seems close, sources familiar
with the case say.
   The prospect of crippling fines and a hostile judge, the taint of
a rackeetering indictment, enormous legal fees and a potential
avalanche of civil lawsuits all are pressuring Drexel to plead
guilty to lesser crimes, the sources said Monday.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder declined comment on the firm's
strategy, but management sent a letter to employees last week
suggesting a settlement was possible and even preferable.

   The Supreme Court will again study the
constitutionality of multimillion-dollar punitive damage awards, a
growing phenomenon in U.S. courtrooms that has sparked legislative
debate nationwide.
   The justices agreed Monday to decide whether such awards that far
exceed actual damages violate a constitutional ban on excessive
fines. At stake are large sums of money awarded in a wide variety of
lawsuits.
   The court, which failed in the past to resolve the question, will
tackle the issue in an appeal by a Texas-based waste collection
business ordered to pay $6 million to a Vermont competitor.

   Four major companies plan to offer their
shareholders a chance to exchange more than $5 billion in stock for
a new type of security that could be traded whole or broken into
three parts.
   The proposal was described Monday as giving high-quality American
companies a ``serious alternative'' to the heavy borrowing usually
associated with stock buybacks that have forced other companies to
sell off major assets, watch their debt ratings fall and cut
spending on items such as research.
   Shareholders who chose to do so would trade a common share for a
new security called an ``unbundled stock unit'' that would consist
of a 30-year bond, preferred stock and a stock appreciation
certificate.

largest consumer products company.
   About 98 percent of Kraft's common stock, or more than 117
million shares, was tendered under Philip Morris' $106-a-share cash
offer that expired Friday, the tobacco and consumer products giant
said Monday.
   Philip Morris said it planned to complete the acquisition as soon
as possible, but offered no specific date.

   FRAMINGHAM, Mass. (AP) _ Zayre Corp. is spinning off its
wholesale division and merging with its TJX Cos. subsidiary in a
major restructuring that will end the company's association with the
59-year-old Zayre discount store chain name.
   Meanwhile, Ames Department Stores Inc., which bought 392 Zayre
stores from Zayre Corp. for $800 million in September, announced
Monday it would close 74 of the outlets.
   Zayre said it would pay a $3.50-a-share dividend to stockholders
after forming a separate company for its BJ's Wholesale Club and
HomeClub operations. After spinning off those operations, Zayre
would merge with TJX Cos., a subsidiary of which it owns 83 percent,
and change its name to TJX Cos.

<HEAD>Productivity Gains, But Predictions Grow Bleak</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Manufacturing productivity is still on the rise, but a new survey
finds the the nation's business economists growing pessimistic about
the economy's fate in 1989.
   The Labor Department said Monday that productivity in the
manufacturing sector improved at an annual rate of 5.2 percent in
the third quarter. A 7.2 percent jump in annual output was
accompanied by only a 1.8 percent jump in employment and overtime to
accomplish it.
   Businesses as a whole did not fare as well. Productivity among
non-farm businesses _ including the service sector that now accounts
for about half of the nation's economic activity _ improved by just
1.9 percent on 3.4 percent higher output and a 1.5 percent rise in
hours worked.
   ``It's pretty puny,'' said Michael Evans, who runs an economic
forecasting firm in Washington. ``The ability to raise our standard
of living is hardly improving at all. That's the real effect of the
budget deficits and these leveraged buyouts (of corporations).
   ``We're spending all these billions on interest payments instead
of capital improvements, research and development and
infrastructure,'' he said.
   Still, the 1.9 percent improvement in efficiency was better than
the 1.3 percent estimated earlier, before the government last week
revised the nation's gross national product upward for the third
quarter. It also nearly offset a 2.4 percent decline in productivity
in the second quarter.
   But the survey of 200 members of the National Association of
Business Economists predicted higher prices and interest rates next
year.
   An overwhelming majority of the economists, 88 percent, predicted
President-elect George Bush would have to deal with a recession in
his first two years in office; 40 percent forecast the country would
be in a downturn by this time next year.
   The group predicted that the overall economy, as measured by the
gross national product, would grow 2.2 percent next year, far below
the 3.5 percent forecast by the administration.
   The group said consumer prices, which have been rising at a 4.6
percent annual rate this year, would climb by 5 percent in 1989, and
interest rates would also continue upward.
   In other economic news Monday, a group of industrialized nations
agreed to lower barriers to imports of tropical products such as
coffee, cocoa and bananas, but wide gaps remained over the most
contentious issues in free-trade talks among more than 100 nations.
   Negotiators expressed pessimism about the outlook for accords on
such issues as farm subsidies, trade in services and international
protection of patents and copyrights.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities were mixed in the latest auction, with rates on six-month
bills climbing to the highest level in more than three years.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion in three-month bills
Monday at an average discount rate of 8.04 percent, down from 8.05
percent last week. Another $7.2 billion was sold in six-month bills
at an average discount rate of 8.25 percent, up from 8.13 percent
last week.
   The rates for six-month bills were the highest since April 15,
1985, when they averaged 8.27 percent. The rates for three-month
bills were the lowest since they averaged 7.97 percent on Nov. 21.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.32 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,796.80 and 8.73 percent for six-month bills selling for $9,582.90.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making
changes in adjustable rate home mortgages, rose to 8.75 percent last
week after averaging 8.71 percent the week before.

<TEXT>
   A pre-Christmas settlement of Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.'s legal travails is possible because the Wall Street
firm is facing increased pressure to bargain with federal
prosecutors and its resolve to fight criminal charges is weakening,
sources familiar with the case say.
   The prospect of crippling fines, a hostile judge, an impending
rackeetering indictment, enormous legal fees and a potential flood
of civil lawsuits have combined to make Drexel rethink its position,
they said Monday.
   According to one of the sources, who all spoke on condition they
not be identified, a possible plea agreement or an indictment could
come before Christmas, following final negotiations between Drexel
attorneys and representatives of the Manhattan U.S. attorney's
office.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder declined comment on the firm's
strategy. U.S. attorney's office officials also declined comment on
the Drexel case, in accordance with their policy of silence
regarding pending investigations.
   A settlement of the biggest securities fraud investigation
arising from the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal would mark a
stunning reversal for Drexel, the scrappy Wall Street powerhouse
that vowed to triumph over accusations it conspired with Boesky,
manipulated stock and cheated clients.
   Even with the threat of major criminal charges hanging overhead,
Drexel has continued to dominate in the lucrative business it almost
singlehandedly created, the $175 billion high-yield, high-risk
``junk bond'' market.
   That fact was dramatically illustrated last week when a buyout
team backed by Drexel won a record bidding contest for RJR Nabisco
Inc. for nearly $25 billion. Drexel will earn tens of millions of
dollars in fees by helping place $5 billion in junk bonds crucial to
financing that deal.
   Nonetheless, Drexel's senior management seemed more preoccupied
with the firm's legal troubles last week and suggested privately to
the staff in blunt terms that a settlement was possible and even
preferable.
   ``If we settle, we can put this constant attack on the firm
behind us,'' Drexel Chief Executive Frederick Joseph said in a
memorandum to the firm's 10,000 employees, outlining how he saw the
immediate future possibly unfolding.
   Joseph told employees that talks with U.S. Attorney Rudolph W.
Giuliani ``are now reaching a crucial stage. If we do not agree to
settle with the U.S. attorney, we believe that he intends to indict
the firm (as well as certain of our employees) and to include in
such an indictment so-called racketeering charges (`RICO').''
   Indictment under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations law, originally intended to combat drug pushers and
pimps, would taint Drexel as an allegedly criminal enterprise, tie
up much of the firm's assets and impair its ability to conduct
normal business.
   Conviction could bring crippling fines.
   Moreover, a racketeering conviction would expose Drexel to
potentially hundreds of private lawsuits by investors who claim they
were victimized, for which the firm would risk paying triple damages.
   Even if Drexel believes it can beat the racketeering charges,
attorneys familiar with the case said they think the firm is
reassessing that approach because of the adverse publicity such
charges would create.
   Compounding Drexel's concern is the prospect that the government
may have found other witnesses to testify against the firm besides
Boesky, the notorious speculator who turned state's evidence after
settling insider trading charges two years ago by paying a record
$100 million in penalties.
   Up until recently, Drexel lawyers had been saying confidently
that the crux of the government's investigation hinged on the words
of Boesky, a doublecrosser and admitted liar now serving a
three-year federal prison term.
   In addition, Drexel may fear the wrath of a federal judge likely
to play a major role in any criminal case, Milton Pollack, who has
been presiding over much of the Boesky-related civil litigation to
date and is known for his pro-government leanings in white-collar
frauds.
   Drexel has been fighting unsucessfully to have Pollack
disqualified from hearing the civil fraud case against the firm
brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission three months ago.
So far, that effort seems only to have made the judge more hostile
to Drexel's position.

<HEAD>Four Companies' Stocks Rise after Stock Exchange Plan Proposed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wall Street's initial response was favorable to
plans by four major companies to offer their shareholders a chance
to exchange more than $5 billion in stock for a new type of security
that could be traded whole or broken into three parts.
   The financial services giant American Express Co., consumer
products and foodmaker Sara Lee Corp., health care products provider
Pfizer Inc. and chemicals giant Dow Chemical Co. filed documents
Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission in which they
outlined plans to exchange up to 20 percent of their stock. The
proposed exchanges are expected to begin in mid-January.
   Shareholders who chose to do so would trade a common share for a
new security called an ``unbundled stock unit'' that would consist
of a 30-year bond, preferred stock and a stock appreciation
certificate.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, American Express edged
up 62{ cents a share to $27.50, Dow Chemical rose $2 to $86.12{,
Pfizer rose $1.87{ to $58, and Sara Lee added 87{ cents a share to
$45.37{.
   One of the nation's top ratings services, Moody's Investors
Service, said Monday that it confirmed its debt ratings for American
Express after reviewing its proposal for unbundled stock units.
   Moody's said that although the issuance of the units would
decrease American Express's ``financial flexibility, it would not
weaken its economic fundamentals to a level that would be
inconsistent with its current ratings.''
   The proposal was described as giving high-quality U.S. companies
a ``serious alternative'' to the heavy borrowing usually associated
with stock buybacks that have forced other companies to sell off
major assets, watch their debt ratings fall and cut spending on
items such as research.
   The plan's developer, Ron Gallatin of Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc., cautioned that the new security was ``neither a takeover
defense nor a takeover deterrent'' and said he would not like to see
it used by other than top-quality concerns.
   Investors are expected to be attracted to features of the new
security that would have the same effect as prohibiting a reduction
in dividend and guaranteeing a certain minimum appreciation
regardless of the stock price.
   Government regulators have to review the proposal to ensure it
complies with securities laws.
   The proposal comes at a time when corporate chiefs are under
increasing pressure to increase their stock prices or risk becoming
a target in the record-smashing run of takeovers. It also comes as
investment firms are trying to lure individual investors back to the
market.
   Under the plan:
   _The bond would carry an interest coupon equivalent to the
current dividend rate of the stock and would mature at a premium to
the current stock price.
   _The preferred stock would entitle the holder to any increases in
dividend payments compared with the current dividend over the next
30 years.
   _The stock appreciation certificate would entitle the holder to
any capital gain on the stock in 30 years that exceeds the premium
allotted to the bondholder.
   It is expected that the entire unit, each of its parts and a
combination of the preferred stock and stock appreciation
certificate would be traded separately on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   New York-based American Express proposed exchanging up to 60
million of its common shares, or about 14.4 percent of its stock.
That stake was valued at $1.6 billion at the end of last week.
   Dow Chemical, based in Midland, Mich., proposed to exchange up to
12 million of its shares, or about 6.5 percent, worth about $1.2
billion at the end of last week.
   Sara Lee, which has its headquarters in Chicago, said it would
exchange up to 22 million shares, or about 20 percent, worth about
$987 million at the end of last week.
   Pfizer, based in New York, would exchange up to 33 million
shares, or 20 percent, worth about $1.8 billion.

<TEXT>
   U.S. steel import quotas have outlived their
purpose, but because American producers likely will win extended
protection, the restraints should be made less burdensome to
steel-using manufacturers, say steel traders and a former U.S. trade
official.
   ``Advocates of an efficient economy are set to lose one more
battle to champions of protection,'' said Gary Hufbauer, Georgetown
University professor of financial diplomacy and former deputy
assistant U.S. Treasury secretary for trade and investment policy.
   President-elect George Bush, in a letter written late in the
presidential campaign, offered to renew the 5-year Voluntary
Restraint Agreements instituted by President Reagan.
   Bush's offer came ``at a time when economic factors say enough is
enough. Domestic steel mills are running at 90 percent of capacity,
the industry should earn $2 billion in 1988, and many steel products
are scarce,'' Hufbauer said in a speech Monday night to members of
the American Institute for Imported Steel.
   Earlier Monday, AIIS officials said that if the VRAs must be
extended past their September expiration they should be modified to
prevent a repeat of the steel shortages and sharp price increases
that occurred with some products within the last two years.
   ``We're trying to be realistic,'' newly elected AIIS President
John Griffin said following a Monday morning news conference.
   The more than 30 product quotas prevented foreign producers from
shipping additional steel plate for factory floors and bridge decks,
for example, when U.S. producers could not meet demand, he said.
   ``We've seen projects where they leave holes in the deck because
you can't get plate,'' said Griffin, who is also president of the
Houston steel trader Maurice Pincoffs Co.
   Domestic steel companies contend they still need protection as
the U.S. industry restructures and they deny that natural market
forces, not the VRAs, caused modest price increases and temporary
tightness, not shortages, for some products.
   The VRAs have cost U.S. steel users $7 billion annually in higher
material costs and lost business due to shortages, Hufbauer said.
   ``Steel users have paid their dues for many years,'' he said,
referring to steel trade restraints employed in various forms since
the late 1960s.
   ``The industry has been insulated from imports for so long that
it has become thoroughly addicted,'' Hufbauer said.
   The U.S. companies say only a renewal of the quotas will check
predatory trade practices and allow time to continue the turnaround
that has brought the domestic industry profits of $3.25 billion in
the last seven quarters after losses of $12 billion over the
preceding five years. They accuse foreign producers of selling their
metal at prices set below production costs and of underwriting
operations with government grants.
   ``The fundamental problem in the steel industry has never been
unfair practices abroad,'' Hufbauer said. ``The fundamental problem
was that the U.S. industry became in the 1970s woefully
uncompetitive by comparison with efficient foreign producers. The
industry was overstaffed, and its technology was outmoded.''
   He said that during tough times U.S. producers use the same
pricing strategies they condemn in their foreign competitors.
   ``If U.S. steel producers were put to the test of U.S. trade
laws, most would be found guilty during bad times of unfair trade
practices right within the American market,'' Hufbauer said.
   Nonetheless, modified VRAs are preferable to the expense and
uncertainty of massive trade lawsuits from the U.S. industry, said
the New York-based importers association, the Texas Association of
Steel Importers and the West Coast Metal Importers Association.
   Fred Lamesch, a past president of the importers' association,
said none of the top steel-exporting nations have granted any steel
production subsidies for several years. The only subsidies still
available to European producers are those that help pay employee
benefits when plants close, he said.
   ``The French say America has the biggest subsidy by being able to
give pink slips to workers on Friday and say `Don't come back on
Monday,''' said Hans Mueller, an economics professor at Middle
Tennessee State University who is a consultant for the importers
group.
   ``Most of the subsidies are optical illusions,'' Mueller said.
``We see subsidies in anything different than what we do.''
   U.S. steel users already are complaining that the domestic steel
industry seems too prosperous to be demanding further trade
protection.
   Those demanding changes or abandonment of the quotas include the
Precision Metal Forming Association, the Steel Service Center
Institute, the Forging Industry Association, and heavy equipment
manufacturers Caterpillar Inc. and Deere & Co.

   A stronger-than-expected showing by General Motors
Corp. pushed late November sales of U.S.-made cars and light trucks
up 3.6 percent this year compared with last year.
   U.S. automakers said Monday they sold 326,744 vehicles during the
Nov. 21-30 period, compared with 275,929 the same time last year.
   But sales of imported cars and light trucks fell 10.1 percent to
282,631 late last month, compared with 301,715 last year.
   Percentages are based on daily sales rates, rather than straight
comparisons of 1988 and 1987 figures. There were eight selling days
during the late November period this year and seven last year.
   GM paced U.S. automakers with a 17 percent rise in its late
November car sales, going to 103,137 this year from 77,118 during
the period last year. Ford Motor Co.'s car sales fell 18.7 percent
to 51,424 during late November from 55,374 last year.
   Chrysler Corp.'s car sales slipped 3.6 percent in late November,
based on a daily selling rate, going to 26,863, compared with 24,372
last year.
   The increase at GM and the decline at Ford came, in part, because
of sales patterns during late November last year.
   ``They (sales) were stronger than I expected in late November
only because of a surge in sales by GM,'' said analyst David Healy
of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.
   ``GM a year ago had an unusually low market share, so the 17
percent increase in their selling rate was helped by a unusually
large market share this year and an unusually small one last year,''
Healy said.
   ``This period last year was very weak for GM,'' agreed analyst
Jeannette Garretty of the Bank of America in San Francisco. ``And
this time was when people were making a lot of hay about Ford taking
market share (from GM).
   ``These kind of numbers are not too surprising. I don't think
this means that GM is the hot manufacturer this year and Ford is
not.''
   For the month, GM's car sales rose 14.1 percent, compared with
Ford's decline of 0.5 percent and Chrysler's 1.2 percent increase.
   Among the imports, trucks showed a 19.8 percent decrease in sales
during the month, and sales of cars fell 7.9 percent.
   ``Perhaps one of the real interesting things is that imports are
down so much,'' Garretty said, adding that the monetary exchange
rate and a shift of some manufacturing to the United States by
Japanese companies were among the reasons for the depressed sales
figures.
   ``There is a price effect and the other thing is that in this
model year, there isn't a whole lot that is rip-roaringly new (among
imports) out there,'' she added. ``Imports probably will continue to
stay down.''

<HEAD>Japan's Adjusted GNP Grows 9.3 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's economy grew at an annual rate of 9.3
percent in the July-September quarter due to strength in private
investment and exports, the government reported Tuesday.
   The Economic Planning Agency said the brisk growth in the gross
national product during the second fiscal quarter represents a
significant rebound of the country's economy from an annualized
3.9-percent fall in GNP the previous quarter.
   That decline had reflected sluggish external demand and sagging
housing investment.
   The unexpectedly high growth in exports, however, is raising
concern the direction of the country's economy may be turing once
again to a more export-dependent structure, said government
officials, requesting anonymity.
   The government had set a preliminary target of GNP growth at 3.8
percent for fiscal 1988 ending next March. Most economists
anticipated the growth of adjusted GNP will remain at between 6
percent and 8 percent for the third quarter.
   The annual rate of 9.3 percent, which translates into an adjusted
growth of 2.2 percent from the April-June quarter, suggests the
government's growth target is well within reach, the officials said.
   Officials said brisk personal spending, capital equipment and
housing investment spurred the brisk domestic demand.
   ``The domestic category is taking good form. They are hard
figures,'' said an EPA official.
   A strong 1.5-percent increase in quarter-to-quarter exports,
compared to a 0.7-percent decline in the last quarter, led to
0.4-percent increase in external demand, the officials said.
   Meanwhile, quarter-to-quarter imports declined by 1.1 percent
from the April-June period, largely due to the higher value of the
yen against the dollar.
   EPA officials said the unexpectely higher third quarter figures
seemed to be in part a reaction to the negative growth of the
previous quarter, but the nation's economic growth recovered to a
stable stage.
   ``A renewed increase in exports reflected worldwide economic
expansion, supported by robust private-sector capital spending
centering on the United States, Western Europe and Asian developing
countries,'' Kyodo News Service quoted a senior agency official as
saying.
   Takashi Saito, general managing director of Fuji Bank's research
division, described the annualized growth figure as ``a little
stronger than expected.''
   He said the figure confirms Japan's business conditions are
continuing to expand in the wake of contractions recorded in the
previous quarter.
   ``We feared a downturn in economic liveliness based on the last
quarterly numbers,'' he said.
   He also said the growth in exports raised concerns about the
direction of currency rates and U.S. efforts to reduce its trade
deficit with Japan.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Mixed In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures were mixed in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting new optimism
about wheat exports and continuing concerns about the South American
soybean weather.
   After a lower opening across the board, wheat prices turned
higher while corn, oats and soybeans firmed slightly to trade near
Monday's settlement prices.
   The Agriculture Department said in a report issued late Monday
wheat export inspections last week totaled 28.9 million bushels,
considerably more than the 20 million to 24 million bushels the
trade had expected.
   Pressure on soybean prices stemmed from reports of rain in the
soybean-growing region of Argentina and forecasts for rain in
Brazil, where soybean planting also is under way.
   But Walter Spilka, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &
Co. in New York, said the weather forecasts were sketchy and soybean
trading activity was light.
   ``The market's really just treading water,'' he said.
   In early trading, wheat was 1\ cents to 2\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.15} a bushel; corn was {
cent lower to 1 cent higher with December at $2.52 a bushel; oats
were { cent lower to } cent higher with March at $2.04{ a bushel;
soybeans were { cent lower to 5 cents higher with January unchanged
at $7.56} a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .20 cent to .52 cent higher with December at
71.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .25 cent higher
with January at 82.77 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent lower to .25
cent higher with December at 41.02 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .10 cent lower to .38 cent higher with February at
45.60 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mixed on Monday while pork futures were
higher.

<HEAD>Rusty Jones Seeks Protection from Creditors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rusty Jones Inc. has filed for protection from
creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, saying its car-rustproofing
business had deteriorated as U.S. automakers extended their own
rust-through warranties.
   The filing Monday under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code
seeks time for the beleaguered Chicago-based company to reorganize.
   Rusty Jones' warranty program remains in effect for cars
initially treated before Aug. 1, but claims brought by car owners
will become part of the bankruptcy proceedings, said President
Charles Wortman.
   Claims by auto owners could reach $25 million, Wortman said.
   Since 1985, Rusty Jones has seen its distribution network dwindle
from 3,000 new-car dealerships in the Northeast, Midwest and Florida
to about 1,800, Wortman said in a telephone interview.
   Rusty Jones is a rustproofing product sold by new-car dealers.
The company guarantees treated cars against rust perforation for as
long as the original buyer owns the car.
   ``It ran into trouble basically when the major (car)
manufacturers went ahead and extended the rust protection they
offered consumers to 6-year, 60,000 miles; 7-year, 70,000 miles;
some even have 100,000-mile warranties,'' Wortman said.
   The extended manufacturer warranties discouraged consumers from
purchasing additional rust protection, Wortman said, ``and if he
didn't buy the rust protection, he wouldn't buy the (Rusty Jones)
gloss protection or fabric protection.''
   Rusty Jones announced on Aug. 1 it would no longer offer
warranties with its rustproofing product. Last week, the company
laid off about 90 employees, which represented nearly its entire
workforce.
   ``In our view, the company's viability can only be restored by a
complete reorganization in a Chapter 11 proceeding,'' Wortman said.
``Our goal is to preserve the value of the company and to protect
the interests of claimants and potential claimants.''
   Wortman is a shareholder in Rustco Inc., which purchased Rusty
Jones on Nov. 23 from BCI Consumer Products Corp. and Michael Mater,
former president of Rusty Jones. Rustco's other shareholder is
Renaissance Holdings Inc., a subsidiary of Renaissance Capital Ltd.,
which is headed by bankruptcy specialist Alexander Knopfler.

   In the age of megabuck mergers and massive
debt restructurings, Kelly Services Inc. thinks there's something to
be said for a healthy bottom line.
   While the 6-year-old economic recovery has produced a boom in
temporary services, Kelly has stuck with a low-key, fiscally
conservative style, achieving record sales and earnings all three
quarters this year.
   ``Conservatism makes Kelly stand out a little bit,'' said Sam
Sacco, executive vice president of the National Association of
Temporary Services, a trade association.
   ``The industry is filled with entrepreneurs and risk takers,''
Sacco said. ``Kelly's developed more on a careful, well-plotted
basis.''
   That conservative strategy has made the company a world leader in
temp services with more than 550,000 temporary and 3,800 full-time
employees on the global payroll.
   Net earnings for the third quarter this year jumped 19 percent
from the same period in 1987, to $18.3 million. That came on sales
of $336 million, an 11 percent increase from the year-ago period.
   The company reported 1987 earnings of $50.5 million on sales of
$1.16 billion.
   But despite its obvious success, Kelly's growth is actually
moderating, compared with other major players in the temp industry.
   The industry has grown 18 percent to 20 percent each of the last
two years, said industry analyst Jerry Levine of Merrill Lynch & Co.
in New York. Kelly's revenues, by comparison, have increased about
13 percent a year during that period.
   As in other industries, acquisitions are fueling much of the
growth among Kelly's competitors.
   Manpower Inc., which posted net earnings of $31.1 million on $2.5
billion in sales in 1987, was acquired in September 1987 by Blue
Arrow PLC, a London-based temporary services company.
   Other national temporary service companies, such as Adia
Personnel Services, Inc., and the Olsten Corp., have been expanding
through acquisitions.
   Not Kelly. The acquisition of four small companies in Australia
to establish Kelly branches there this year was a first, according
to Terence E. Adderly, Kelly's president and chief executive officer.
   Kelly also has branches in Canada, Puerto Rico, England, Ireland,
Scotland, Wales and France.
   The company's growth has been driven by the basic laws of supply
and demand.
   Strong growth in the economy during the long expansion has
boosted demand for temps and allowed Kelly to raise rates at a
faster pace than its payroll costs are increasing, a recent analysis
in the Value Line Investment Survey said.
   Cost containment measures also have helped by keeping operating
costs from growing as fast as sales.
   ``Their financial strength is the strongest in the industry,''
said analyst Levine of Merrill Lynch. ``They have an almost
unbelievable amount of cash. It's a most liquid company with cash
flow.''
   Kelly's 1987 annual report showed assets of $232 million, $68.4
million of that cash, and liabilities of $77.6 million.
   Value Line said the company's financial muscle could ``easily
support a large-scale acquisition, a stepped-up expansion program or
a share repurchase program.''
   But the company won't disclose its plans for all its capital.
William Russell Kelly, an industry pioneer who founded the business
in 1946, is chairman of the board and also owner of 80 percent of
the controlling stock.
   A slowdown in new job creation may be biggest threat to Kelly's
future growth. Value Line said the company is likely to achieve 13
percent growth this year, but weaker economic conditions could cut
the rate to 10 percent in 1989.
   Kelly is fighting back with aggressive training and recruiting
programs.
   In the office clerical area, the company believes it has been at
the forefront in adapting to changes brought about by office
automation.
   ``We've trained over 1 million people in the last 10 years on
word processing, and are currently training 250,000 people a year,''
Adderly said of the free service.
   ``We had to take on a training role because of the amount of
people needed to fill jobs,'' said P. Jeffrey Sheak, regional
manager in the Detroit area. ``We haven't been able to recruit them
all.''
   In addition to job fairs and visits to universities and shopping
malls, Kelly is recruiting older people in an effort to expand the
labor pool with experienced former workers.
   The company's Encore program, launched last year, targets workers
age 55 and older, and the age group now comprises 10 percent of
Kelly's temporary work force, compared with 7 percent to 8 percent
in 1987.
   Kelly's greatest asset of all may be its name recognition. Though
company officials say they think the term ``Kelly Girl'' is
outdated, it still appears in newspaper classified ads.
   ``They're like Kleenex of the tissue business. The name is
synonymous with temporary help,'' Sacco said.

<DATELINE>BELLEVILLE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Illinois Power Co. has agreed to pay
$11.5 million to a couple critically injured in a natural-gas
explosion in their home two years ago.
   In a settlement reached Monday, the utility company agreed to pay
Jerry Sickmeier, 33, and Lisa Jines, 26, $10 million in damages and
$1.5 million for medical expenses, said the couple's attorney, C.E.
Heiligenstein.
   Both sustained burns on over 80 percent of their bodies in the
Dec. 7, 1986, explosion at their home in Cahokia, a St. Louis
suburb. They now live in nearby Belleville.
   The settlement was reached on the day a trial in the case was
scheduled to begin.
   ``They are much relieved that this financial ordeal is over with
and that they can have some lifetime financial security,''
Heiligenstein said. ``Both suffered severe burns and have severe
limitations in the limbs.''
   Heiligenstein said neither has worked since the explosion.
   Illinois Power spokeswoman Barbara Lillyman said the utility had
no comment on the settlement.
   The couple alleged that Illinois Power was negligent when it
allowed a natural-gas pipe to deteriorate to the point that it
ruptured. Gas from the pipe traveled through sewer lines into the
home's utility room and was ignited by the pilot light of a
hot-water heater, they said. The explosion occurred as police were
awakening area residents and telling them to evacuate.
   Sickmeier was treated for seven months at Massachusetts General
Hospital in Boston for third-degree burns that covered most of his
body. He also suffered burns in his lungs and spent more than two
months on a respirator.

   D. Joseph Corr, the former president of Trans
World Airlines, has been named chairman and chief executive officer
of Continental Airlines, the company announced Tuesday.
   Corr replaces Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Continental's parent
company, Texas Air Corp. Lorenzo will remain a director of the
Houston-based carrier.
   ``Joe Corr's record speaks for itself. He is a superb manager who
has improved the performance of several companies,'' Lorenzo said.
``He understands the airline business, and we are confident that he
will build on the progress that has been made at Continental.''
   Lorenzo also said that Corr's selection ``emphasizes Texas Air's
commitment to managing our airlines separately, and it will allow me
to devote all of my time to Texas Air activities.
   Texas Air also owns Miami-based Eastern Airlines.
   As president of TWA beginning in April 1986, Corr helped lead the
carrier from potential bankruptcy to record profitability,
Continental said in a statement announcing the appointment.
   He accomplished the same at ACF Industries, where profits
increased fourfold between 1983 and 1986, the statement said. Corr
served in various capacities at ACF from 1977 and 1988, including
president between 1984 and 1986 and vice chairman since 1986.

<HEAD>Satellite Photos Help California Farmers</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By JOE BIGHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRESNO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Satellite photos that can tell a farmer a
sprinkler head needs fixing or a field needs spraying may seem
pretty far out, but such space-age technology is available and is
expected to grow.
   Robert W. Smith, a consultant in Lodi, Calif., says satellite
technology is just beginning ``to break loose from government
stranglehold'' and become more widely available.
   ``Particularly in the agricultural industry, information needs to
be more accessible,'' he said.
   During a recent trade show of farm equipment in Fresno, Smith
displayed some infrared photos taken from high above the fertile
fields of central California.
   The satellite photos were color-coded, sort of like
election-night television maps. Red spots in the photos showed the
crops on the ground were healthy, Smith explained in an interview.
   ``If we see a blemish in the red photo, it tells us there is some
kind of stress,'' he said. ``That might be good, like irrigation,
which is a stress factor. ... Another blemish may show disease.''
   A photo can cover an area as large as 100 miles by 110 miles, so
the spot that has a potential problem must be magnified. Technicians
can get the resolution down to one acre, but usually magnify down to
a 10-acre plot, Smith said.
   Satellite photos can save money by helping farmers determine more
precisely when and where to irrigate, fertilize or spray for pests.
   ``If you own a large amount of acreage, it isn't always necessary
to spray; you don't always need all those nutrients,'' said Smith.
   The use of satellite photos on the farm is still quite limited
across the country because of the cost and complexity of the tool,
those familiar with the technology say. Two companies provide raw
data from satellites orbiting the earth: EOSAT, an American firm
based in Lanham, Md., and SPOT, a French consortium operating from
Reston, Va.
   The data is available in photographic form or in digital form on
computer tape.
   A single photograph _ or batch of tape _ from one of the major
satellite services will cover a huge area and cost anywhere from
$1,600 to $3,800. And a farmer will also need someone to interpret
the data for him, which will increase the cost.
   A slightly more cost-efficient service is provided by a limited
number of smaller firms, such as Senstar Inc. of Fresno, which can
shoot similar type photographs using specially equipped cameras
mounted on aircraft.
   Norris Packer of Senstar says he uses digital cameras fitted with
infrared and thermal sensors to shoot photographs for West Coast
farmers. He also helps farmers interpret the data. But he said the
cost of $1.15 an acre really only makes sense for big operators of
1,000 acres or more.
   ``The smaller farmer gets out and walks his fields every day,
anyway,'' Packer reasoned.
   He claims bigger farmers might benefit from satellite photography
because it lets them ``solve problems before they start to cost
money.''
   Oregon farmer Frank Lamb, for example, uses satellite photographs
to keep track of 10,000 acres of potatoes, alfalfa and other crops
in Hermiston, Ore. He has even gone into the business of providing
the technology to his neighbors.
   Recently, a photograph spotted a blemish in one of Lamb's fields,
which turned out to be a broken spigot; the photo also warned that
nematodes had infested another sector, according to Smith.
   Smith said the farmer estimated it would have taken his employees
up to three weeks to find those problems, which could have been
costly.
   Small-scale farmers can take part in this space-age technology
through cooperatives or such organizations as the California Farm
Bureau, Smith said.
   Packer said a tomato grower might need three photos during a
six-week period to find out which fields are ripe enough to pick.
   His company plans an experiment over California citrus groves
this winter to focus on frost damage and figures two pictures might
be needed for that crop in a season.
   One of the needs in the next few years, Smith said, will be more
companies like Packer's to interpet the photos for farmers.
   Smith contended that satellite photography is simply ``going back
to the basic principle of know your land.''

<HEAD>Sun Canning The Can In Favor Of Bottle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TULSA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sun Refining & Marketing Co. is bowing to
consumer desires and canning the can _ the one-quart can of motor
oil, that is.
   From now on, Sunoco brand oil in quart sizes will be available
only in resealable plastic bottles.
   B.D. Weaver, manager of packaging and warehousing for Sun in
Tulsa, said the bottles have almost entirely replaced the
once-familiar cardboard cans with the metal top and bottom.
   ``It's entirely consumer driven,'' he said. ``We're a company
which holds the customer to be a primary concern, and the plastic
resealable bottle is what the people want.''
   Sun blends and packages lubricants for several other companies in
addition to its Sunoco brand.
   The company reported it filled 11.2 million gallons of oil in the
traditional can in 1985. But the next year, that number was nearly
halved to 6.6 million gallons, while another 1.6 million gallons
went into bottles.
   Last year, Sun marketed 10.7 million gallons in bottles and 1.4
million gallons in cans. And in the first 10 months of 1988, Sun
packaged 9.1 million gallons in bottles and only 375,000 in cans.
   Quart bottles comprise about 50 percent of Sun's packaging
business. The other half is marketed in drums, five-gallon pails and
jugs of various sizes. It also ships lubricants by truck and rail
car.

   Stock prices were little changed in a drifting
session today, leveling off after Monday's rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 31.48 points on
Monday, rose another 2.31 to 2,126.07 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 9 to 8 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 631 up, 712 down and
557 unchanged.
   The market's latest upswing has been attributed partly to a new
restructuring tactic announced by four large companies Monday and
reported to be under consideration by several others.
   The deals involve the proposed swap of ``unbundled stock units,''
or packages of three different types of securities, for large
amounts of their outstanding common shares.
   The idea drew mixed reviews from analysts and accountants, some
of whom criticized it as a gimmick.
   However some investors evidently saw it as a potential boost to
the values put on companies by the marketplace.
   Long Island Lighting led the active list, down 1{ at 12\ on
turnover of more than 5.8 million shares. On Monday a jury found the
company guilty of fraud in the process of obtaining rate increases
relating to its Shoreham nuclear power plant.
   Rorer Group rose 1~ to 47. The company said it couldn't explain
the activity, and declined comment on a report that Beecham Group of

<HEAD>Kohlberg Kravis Formally Commences Biggest Takeover in History</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   RJR Nabisco Inc.'s prospective new owner formally
began the biggest takeover in history Tuesday, amending a previous
tender offer for the cigarette-and-food giant's stock from $90 a
share to the final price of $109, or nearly $25 billion.
   The investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. said in a
statement that Jan. 11 was the deadline for RJR stockholders to
submit their shares.
   Kohlberg will pay $109 a share in cash for 72 percent of RJR's
outstanding shares. But if all shareholders tender their shares, as
expected, each will receive $81 a share in cash and $28 a share in
securities.
   The investment firm also said it intended to file additional
information on Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission
concerning financing arrangements, investment banking fees and other
details.
   Kohlberg outmaneuvered a rival offer from RJR's top managers to
win a tumultuous bidding contest for the nation's 19th largest
industrial company Nov. 30
   The investment firm has said it eventually intends to sell about
$6 billion in food assets of RJR, the Atlanta-based maker of
hundreds of products that range from Ritz crackers to Camel
cigarettes.
   RJR's debt load will more than quadruple under Kohlberg, which is
using only a fraction of its own money for the purchase and will
borrow the rest using RJR's assets as collateral, in what is
commonly called a leveraged buyout.
   Kohlberg has not specified how many of RJR's senior managers it
intends to retain in the company but is expected to terminate the
contracts of those who teamed with chief executive F. Ross Johnson
to make a rival bid. Johnson also is expected to leave but his
intentions are unclear.
   RJR's tobacco subsidiary switched assignments of three top
executives in what it said Monday was likely to be the first of a
series of changes under Kohlberg.
   The price tag for RJR is nearly double the previous record for a
corporate takeover, the $13.4 billion acquisition of Gulf Oil Corp.
by what is now Chevron Corp. in 1984.
   The RJR deal is also more than four times the size of previous
record leveraged buyout, the $6.1 billion sale of Beatrice Cos. in
1986 to a group led by Kohlberg.
   The scope and complexity of the RJR takeover raised new concern
about the leveraged buyout trend, particularly over whether such
transactions threaten the nation's economy by multiplying the level
of corporate debt.
   Many economists and lawmakers have expressed fear that
debt-burdened companies such as RJR will forego important strategic
investments for the sake of paying off debt. Moreover, some say, a
slight rise in interest rates can have a devastating impact on such
companies by increasing their debt payments.

<TEXT>
   Share prices closed higher on London's Stock
Exchange Tuesday, helped by a string of favorable corporate earnings
reports and by a continued good performance on Wall Street.
   But trading activity was light as many players remained on the
sidelines amid uncertainty over whether the market has to fall
further following its recent sharp declines.
   ``People aren't in a hurry to buy at the moment. They just want
to see which way the market is going,'' said one equity saleswoman.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 5.8
points, or 0.3 percent at 1,767.4, at the close, roughly at the
midpoint of the day's trading range.
   The Financial Times 30-share index finished with a gain of 5.8
points at 1,444.8.
   Volume was light, as 466.4 million shares changed hands.
   The volume figure was sharply lower than Monday's total of 645.4
million shares, when volume was inflated by massive turnover of 261
million shares in formerly government-owned British Steel PLC on its
first day of trading.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 6.22
points at 2,129.98 at the London close, extending its more than
30-point rally on Monday.
   The Financial Times 500-share index rose 2.31 points to close at

<HEAD>Grains, Soybeans Higher on Buying by Single Trading Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were sharply
higher Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as the markets finished
a roller-coaster ride on the upside in the wake of activity by a
single large trading company.
   Iowa Grain Co., a Chicago-based speculative trading firm,
triggered a sharp dip in grain and soybean prices just one day
earlier by leading a sell-off.
   But Tuesday, the company bought soybeans early, setting off a
rally as traders followed the move. Iowa Grain then turned around
and sold beans, but after prices broke, reversed positions again and
started buying.
   ``And away we went,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean
Witter Reynolds in Chicago.
   Iowa Grain also bought wheat, setting off a rally in that pit.
   ``Iowa was so active, it overshadowed (concerns about) the
weather in South America,'' Lespinasse added. ``What would otherwise
have been a dull market turned lively, and the traders followed Iowa
because they were calling the tune.''
   There had been pressure on soybean prices because of reports of
rain in the soybean-growing region of Argentina and forecasts for
rain in Brazil, where soybean planting also is under way.
   On the close, wheat was 4 cents to 8{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.19 a bushel; corn was 2{
cents to 5} cents higher with December at $2.58\ a bushel; oats were
3{ cents to 7\ cents higher with March at $1.98\ a bushel; soybeans
were 14 cents to 16 cents higher with January at $7.72 a bushel.

   Reactions ranged from ``terrible'' to
``fresh'' at the unveiling of a mineral water flavored with
truffles, the subterranean fungi famed as the world's most expensive
food ingredient.
   ``Very few connoisseurs know what truffles really taste like,''
commented restaurateur Fritz Castel as the Mendocino Beverage Co.
unveiled a limited marketing of mineral water flavored with the
highly aromatic essence of France's $500-a-pound perigord truffles.
   The main fame of the fungi, which are available only a few months
of the year, comes from the way they are harvested: by trained pigs
and dogs that sniff out the delicacy where it grows at the base of
certain trees in France and Italy, and lately in the Northern
California and Oregon forests.
   The 10-ounce bottle of flavored water is priced at $4 and is to
be sold, for now, only in the gourmet department of the Neiman
Marcus department store here. A three-liter bottle of the water was
auctioned for $950 last summer at the Sonoma Valley Wine Auction.
   Without the truffle juice, a 10-ounce bottle of the water costs
50 cents.
   ``That's terrible,'' a wine writer remarked at Friday's unveiling
to a food writer, who thought, ``Hmmm, it's very fresh and unusual.
I don't know if it will sell.''
   When a New York Times writer reviewed the drink, the headline on
the column said, ``Earthiness That Should Have Stayed In The Earth.''
   ``It has a certain earthiness,'' said one participant at the
tasting. Another thought it was an interesting way to find out what
all the truffle fuss is about.
   Chefs throughout the world fight each other each winter and
spring for a few ounces of truffles. They are used to flavor and
lend a distinctive aroma to the most special dishes. A single
truffle can flavor gallons of food.
   ``It's something special,'' said Mendocino Beverage's owner,
Georg Moller-Racke, who commissioned restaurateur John Ashe to
formulate the drink. Moller-Racke touted the truffle water as an
upscale alterative for people who don't drink alcohol but want a
special touch in their bottled water.

<BYLINE>Reagan's Meeting Gorbachev? Where Are They Eating?
^By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When John Patrick Doherty first read about this
week's Reagan-Gorbachev meeting, his thoughts quickly shifted to one
major issue _ what were they doing for lunch?
   ``I was wondering if they planned to meet at the Waldorf,''
confessed Doherty, the head chef at the Manhattan luxury hotel and
creator of the meal the two world leaders will share Wednesday.
   ``Last Wednesday, they asked me if I would be interested. I
submitted three menus for approval. ... They chose one on Friday,''
said Doherty, a Waldorf chef for the past 11 years. ``It was great.
I was very happy.''
   Cooking for President Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev is no
different from preparing any other meal _ except for the presence of
Secret Service agents in the kitchen, Doherty said Tuesday between
samples of the wild mushroom ravioli which will start the summit
lunch.
   ``As much attention and care as I'm giving this, you have to do
that with everything,'' said Doherty, who became head chef 3{ years
ago. ``You don't get a reputation for quality cooking, as a quality
chef, by being supercreative. The truly good chefs, the quality of
their preparation is top-notch.''
   Initially, the White House had declared the luncheon menu
off-limits to the news media until after the meal. But the
restrictions were eased enough for Doherty to provide some word on
what would be served.
   First will come a chicken consomme and the wild mushroom ravioli,
followed by tournedos or rounded filets of veal with smoked quail
and lobster sausage, braised cabbage and leeks, roesti potatoes that
are julienned and sauteed until crisp, and sauteed fresh leaf
spinach.
   Wine will be a California chardonnay. Dessert is a chocolate tart
with almond cream cheese, fresh fruit and raspberry sauce.
   Total preparation time for the lunch for 14 people will be about
four hours, said Doherty, who was being assisted by two other
Waldorf chefs. Final touches will be made at Governors Island, the
historic fort and Coast Guard complex in New York Harbor where the
luncheon will be held.
   Since Reagan generally stays at the Waldorf-Astoria when in New
York, it will not be the first time Doherty, 30, has prepared a
presidential repast. And Reagan has twice personally complimented
him on his cooking, the chef said.
   ``This style of cooking is what he prefers,'' Doherty said of the
president. ``There are some guidelines for keeping his health in
mind. ... But I've done this many times.''

   Stock prices pushed ahead for the second straight
session today, following the lead of a very strong government bond
market.
   Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite
direction from interest rates, climbed about $20 for each $1,000 in
face value today.
   Analysts said bonds were buoyed by hopes that Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, who arrived in the United States this afternoon,
would make proposals that would allow cutbacks in defense spending.
   Under the reasoning that seemed to prevail in the markets, that
would in turn reduce inflationary pressures and help the United
States deal with its budget deficit.
   Most of the stock market's gains came late in the session on a
wave of computer program trading by professionals.
   The market's latest upswing has also been attributed partly to a
new restructuring tactic announced by four large companies Monday
and reported to be under consideration by several others.
   The deals involve the proposed swap of ``unbundled stock units,''
or packages of three different types of securities, for large

<HEAD>Japan Keeps Low Profile In Trade Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Japan has been keeping a low profile in a
critical round of international trade talks here, in contrast with
its prowess as a global trader.
   Japan, which enjoys the biggest trade surplus in the world, is
one of 100 countries taking part in talks on liberalizing and
updating the 40-year-old General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   But among the dozens of position papers floating around the halls
of Montreal's convention center, few have been Japan's. And Japanese
officials have been elusive.
   Unlike the United States, the European Economic Community, host
nation Canada, and such countries as India, Japan has not briefed
reporters once on its positions over the past four days of talks.
   The only scheduled Japanese briefing was canceled, because the
person who was supposed to conduct the session was busy.
   In contrast to the growing leadership position Japan has been
assuming on the world monetary and financial front, it continues to
be highly sensitive on trade.
   On the most divisive point in the negotiations _ the battle
between the United States and the 12-nation EEC on agricultural
subsidies, Japan has been on the sidelines.
   As the chief EEC negotiator Willy de Clercq put it, ``the
Japanese have been sitting back and looking at this like a pingpong
game between us and the Americans.''
   The debate, which has divided the allegiances of other nations,
concerns a U.S. demand for eliminaton of trade-distorting farm
supports, which the Europeans reject out of hand.
   Although Japan is the world's biggest importer of agricultural
products, it appears more than happy to let the two slug it out.
   ``Our position is that there is no point in making decisions
until they settle,'' said Mutsuyoshi Nishimura, Japan's director of
foreign press relations.
   Nishimura said that whatever the outcome, Japan's prime concern
is the protection of its rice market against foreign imports.
   The United States, seeking support for its position in the GATT
talks, has promised to take into account the concerns of other
countries over ``food security.''
   Translated, this means allowing other countries to stockpile
emergency food supplies.
   But Nishimura said Japan was still not clear whether the U.S.
promise would guarantee Japan the right to limit imports of rice.
   ``We have a vulnerable sector of rice farmers, and they are a
very strong constituency,'' he said in an interview. ``We must step
gingerly.''
   Underscoring the political sensitivity of the issue, Japan's
ruling Liberal Democratic Party sent a delegation to the Montreal
talks to make sure the professional negotiators did not cave in to
pressure.
   Japan has been particularly concerned at threats that the United
States would use a new trade bill to retaliate against its closed
rice import policies.
   But the United States and Japan appear to have reached a tacit
understanding that the Americans would not push the rice issue in
Montreal if the Japanese agreed to leave it on the table for future
talks.
   Conscious of its international commitment to assume broader
leadership in the world commensurate with its economic power, Japan
adopted a package in Montreal that reduces tariffs on exports by
developing nations to the industrialized world.
   Under the agreement, Japan will reduce tariffs on the import of
some 180 tropical products, worth about $3 billion in annual
imports, Nishimura said.
   But rice was kept out of that package, much to Japan's relief.
   ``The Japanese aren't willing to stick their necks out like we
are or even the United States,'' said one European official.
   But Nishimura disagreed with that assessment, saying Japan's low
profile was a reflection of ``national character.''
   ``We may not be as articulate as some, but we are as assertive as
we need to be,'' he said.

<HEAD>Lawyer Argues That Women Disenfranchised By Not Having Votes
Weighted</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer for Dalkon Shield claimants said
Tuesday that the process by which the A.H. Robins Co. Inc.
bankruptcy plan was approved effectively disenfranchised women with
the largest injury claims.
   A three-judge panel of the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals heard
arguments challenging the reorganization plan, which includes a $2.5
billion trust fund for women injured by the Robins-manufactured
Dalkon Shield birth control device. A ruling is not expected for
several months.
   Alan B. Morrison, a lawyer for the Public Citizen Litigation
Group in Washington, D.C., argued that confirmation of the plan was
invalid because claimants were not given a range of possible
monetary awards when they voted to approve it and because their
votes were not weighted.
   Morrison criticized the ``unexplained and unjustified refusal''
of U.S. District Judge Robert R. Merhige, who approved the plan in
July, to break down the $2.5 billion figure. Instead, he said,
claimants were simply told they would be paid in full, with no
explanation of what that meant.
   ``The only logical reason he didn't break out the numbers is
because they wouldn't stand up,'' Morrison told the judges.
   He said the vote, in which more than 95 percent of the claimants
returning ballots voted in favor of the plan, might have come out
differently if women with larger claims had been given weighted
votes. The bankruptcy code requires that creditors' votes be
weighted according to the size of their claims, Morrison said.
   ``That in effect disenfranchised those with large claims,''
Morrison said.
   But James C. Roberts, an attorney for Robins, said weighting the
votes would have been time-consuming and impractical. Merhige
``tried mightily'' to come up with a system of weighted voting, but
was unable to, Roberts said. If the value of claims had to be
estimated in advance so that votes could be weighted, ``the job
would never be done,'' he said.
   Roberts said Merhige based the $2.5 billion figure on expert
testimony at an estimation hearing last year. Claimants had ``more
information than the law required'' about possible award amounts, he
said.
   Morrison also challenged a provision of the bankruptcy plan that
prevents claimants from filing suit against doctors, Robins
officers, law firms and other third parties in the case. He said
third parties are not entitled to bankruptcy protection without
filing for bankruptcy, and claimants should be allowed to sue them
to recover full damages.
   The appellate panel also heard challenges to a settlement with
Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., Robins' insurer, and to Merhige's
authority over the claim fund trustees.
   Close to 200,000 women have filed claims of Dalkon Shield-related
injuries ranging from infections to sterility, miscarriage, and
children born with birth defects. The bulk of those claims cannot be
settled until appeals to the reorganization plan are exhausted.
   Robins filed for bankruptcy in August 1985 after thousands of
women filed suit against the company. The reorganization plan
provides for the Richmond pharmaceutical company to be acquired by
American Home Products Corp. of New York in a $700 million exchange
of stock. American Home can back out of the plan if appeals are not
settled by next July.

<HEAD>G-7 Growth Highest Since Early '70s, IMF Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>

   In what would be the fastest growth since the
early 1970s, the International Monetary Fund said it expects the
economies of the seven biggest industrial nations to expand 4.25
percent this year.
   Michel Camdessus, director general of the IMF, announced the
upward revision in the output of goods and services, from 4.0
percent, as he said the rapid growth created a ``golden
opportunity'' for the industrialized nations to open their markets
to each other and to developing nations.
   ``We are now in a good growth period,'' Camdessus told reporters
late Monday in advance of a speech Tuesday at free-trade talks under
auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The group of seven countries covered by the IMF forecast are the
United States, Japan, Britain, France, West Germany, Italy and
Canada.
   The IMF has steadily raised its forecast for growth in the seven
countries, from 3.25 percent to 3.8 percent to 4 percent and now
4.25 percent. The actual growth for this year will not be known
until sometime in 1989.
   On inflation, the IMF is keeping its most recent forecast of an
inflation rate of 3.2 percent in the seven countries this year,
Camdessus said.
   In spite of the healthy growth, Camdessus said he was concerned
by evidence of an increase in non-tariff barriers to world trade
among a broader range of industrialized nations.
   According to a new IMF report, the industrial countries made more
restrictive changes in trade policy last year than liberalizing
changes, 85 to 66.
   In contrast, the report said, developing countries made more
liberalizing changes than restrictive ones, 227 to 126.
   Protectionism in industrialized nations hampers the ability of
developing nations to grow through exports and deal with their
crushing debt burdens.
   The new IMF report has other ammunition for free traders. Quoting
from a United Nations report, it said 23 percent of the imports of
developed countries aside from fuel were subject to non-tariff
measures last year, up from 19 percent in 1981.
   Worldwide, farm supports cost consumers and taxpayers an average
of $185 billion a year in 1984 through 1986, the report said,
quoting the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
   The International Monetary Fund was created after World War II to
tide over countries that faced short-term debt crises and to promote
world trade. It is now closely involved in the affairs of many
heavily indebted developing countries.
   Camdessus said he welcomed the plans of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade to monitor more closely the adherence of all
nations to free-trade principles. That surveillance would parallel
the surveillance that the IMF already does of countries' debt
servicing and commitment to growth-oriented policies.
   Many developing nations, already irked by the IMF's involvement
in their domestic affairs, are concerned that the GATT will become
another meddling hand.
   The IMF report said that since free trade helps all countries
involved in it, ``it does not make economic sense to delay
unilateral measures to obtain multilateral liberalization.''
   In his briefing to reporters, Camdessus said it would be
``suicidal'' for nations to insist that progress in other areas of
free trade be linked to progress on their own particular issues.
   ``Unless we press forward, the risk is that we shall move
backward,'' he said in the text of his speech.

   Stock prices chalked up their second straight
gain Tuesday, benefiting from a sharp drop in open-market interest
rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 25.60 to 2,149.36
on top of a 31.48-point jump Monday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
914 up, 555 down and 520 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 158.34 million
shares, up from 144.66 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 190.25 million shares.
   Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite
direction from interest rates, climbed about $20 for each $1,000 in
face value Tuesday.
   Analysts said bonds were buoyed by hopes that Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, who arrived in the United States Tuesday
afternoon, would make proposals that would allow cutbacks in defense
spending.
   Under the reasoning that seemed to prevail in the markets, that
would in turn stand to reduce inflationary pressures and help the
United States deal with its budget deficit.
   Most of the stock market's gains came late in the session on a
wave of computer program trading by professionals.
   The market's latest upswing has also been attributed partly to a
new restructuring tactic announced by four large companies Monday
and reported to be under consideration by several others.
   The deals involve the proposed swap of ``unbundled stock units,''
or packages of three different types of securities, for large
amounts of their outstanding common shares.
   The idea drew mixed reviews from analysts and accountants, some
of whom criticized it as a gimmick.
   However some investors evidently saw it as a potential boost to
the values put on companies by the marketplace.
   USX gained } to 28{ and Texaco was up 1[ at 48~ amid rumors and
speculation that financier Carl Icahn, who holds big stakes in both
companies, might be planning some new move.
   Elsewhere among the blue chips, International Business Machines
rose 1\ to 122[; General Electric ~ to 45|, and American Telephone &
Telegraph ] to 29{.
   Long Island Lighting led the active list, down 1{ at 12\ on
turnover of more than 8.3 million shares. On Monday a jury found the
company guilty of fraud in the process of obtaining rate increases
relating to its Shoreham nuclear power plant.
   Rorer Group rose 1] to 46{. The company said it couldn't explain
the activity, and declined comment on a report that Beecham Group of
London might be interested in acquiring it.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $20.17 billion, or 0.75
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
1.30 to 155.78.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 2.93 to 319.85, and S&P's
500-stock composite index was up 2.66 at 277.59.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
1.59 to 377.00. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 297.36, up .61.

   President-elect George Bush, who has pledged to
give trade a top priority, filled the government's top two trade
policy jobs Tuesday with Texas oilman Robert Mosbacher as commerce
secretary and prominent Washington lawyer Carla Hills as U.S. trade
representative.
   The vice president, announcing his latest choices at a news
conference in the Old Executive Office Building, said he was
completing his economic team with the naming of Stanford economist
Michael Boskin as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
   Bush also told reporters he had decided to ``take the offensive''
on coming up with a budget strategy that attacks the federal deficit
without new taxes. ``It is my responsibility to do that. What that
means in terms of form, I am not quite sure yet,'' he said.
   Ms. Hills, 54, who was secretary of housing and urban development
in 1975-77 under President Ford, is the first woman Bush has
designated for a high-level position in his administration.
   Although the trade post was not originally a Cabinet-level job,
Reagan elevated it to such. Ms. Hills told reporters that Bush had
agreed to retain the post as a Cabinet position in his
administration.
   Mosbacher, 61, is an old friend from Bush's oil days in Houston
in the 1960s. Bush said that Mosbacher would bring to the post
``tremendous energies to promoting exports abroad.''
   Currently the chairman of the Mosbacher Energy Co. of Houston,
Mosbacher was finance chairman of Bush's presidential campaign.
   Bush announced the two top trade jobs _ commerce and trade
representative _ in the midst of delicate trade negotiations in
Montreal under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT).
   In Montreal, Kelley Winkler, an aide to current Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter, said the changes would not affect
the U.S. position in favor of phasing out all international
agricultural subsidies by the end of the century.
   Bush has proposed making the subject of agricultural subsidies
the top agenda item on his first economic summit, to be held next
spring in France.
   The trade representative negotiates trade agreements with other
countries and investigates complaints of unfair trade practices; the
commerce secretary enforces trade policy and seeks more markets for
U.S. goods, as well as serving as a voice for U.S. business within
the government.
   The commerce secretary also oversees one of the government's most
varied agencies, ranging from the National Weather Service to the
Census Bureau to the National Bureau of Standards.
   Mosbacher, who is worth an estimated $200 million from his oil
and gas holdings and investments in real estate and ranching, is a
former chairman of the National Petroleum Council.
   He takes over from former steel executive C. William Verity, who
has held the job for only a year. Reagan appointed Verity after the
death of Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige in a freak horseback
riding accident.
   Transition officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said
Mosbacher had been promised the job several weeks ago, but that the
FBI background check on him had taken longer than anticipated
because of his vast financial holdings.
   Among the tasks facing the new secretary will be implementing the
new free-trade agreement with Canada, already approved by the United
States but awaiting Canadian ratification. Bush during his campaign
said he would like to see a similar pact negotiated with Mexico.
   The trade deficit was $170 billion last year and was running at
an annual rate of $137 billion this year, making the two trade jobs
ones of high visibility.

   The dollar rose against all the major currencies
Tuesday as stocks and Treasury bonds surged higher.
   Gold prices edged lower. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a late bid of $426.75 for a troy ounce of gold, down from
$428.05 late Monday.
   Analysts said there was no news to affect dollar trading, but the
U.S. curency moved higher on short covering, transactions in which
traders buy dollars to fulfill earlier agreements to sell them.
   Soaring stock and bond prices also lifted the dollar higher, said
Ronald Holzer, chief dealer with Harris Trust & Co. in Chicago.
   ``There's a general movement into U.S. assets today,'' Holzer
said.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 25.60 to
2,149.36, while the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond climbed more
than $24 per $1,000 in face value by late afternoon.
   In overseas trading, dealers also attributed the dollar's advance
to short-covering. They said foreign exchange markets were already
waiting for the Dec. 14 release of U.S. trade figures for October.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8675 late Tuesday, cheaper
for buyers than Monday's late $1.8690. In later New York trading,
the pound slipped to $1.86025 from $1.8683.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
prices, included: 1.7376 West German marks, up from 1.72605; 1.45755
Swiss francs, up from 1.44425; 5.9130 French francs, up from 5.8875;
1,282.50 Italian lire, up from 1,275.45; and 1.19135 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.18675.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.7290 West German marks, up from 1.7225; 1.4480
Swiss francs, up from 1.4420; 5.9015 French francs, up from 5.8800;
1.9470 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9425; 1,277.12 Italian lire, up
from 1,273.50; and 1.1887 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1851.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 121.54 Japanese yen, up from
121.53. In London late Tuesday the dollar traded slightly higher at
121.55 yen, and in New York, the dollar rose to 121.915 yen from
late Monday's 121.565.
   Gold closed in London, the major European trading center, at a
bid $427.25 a troy ounce, down from $428.75. The Zurich closing bid
price was $427.75, down from $429.
   Earlier, gold closed in Hong Kong at a bid $429.73, down from
$429.94.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, a troy ounce of gold fell
to $427.50 from $429.30 late Monday.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $6.12 bid a troy ounce,
down from $6.14.
   On the Commodity Exchange, silver edged down to $6.161 from
$6.163 a troy ounce.

   Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. said Tuesday it has
elected its president Tom H. Barrett to be chief executive officer.
   Barrett, 58, replaces Robert E. Mercer, who will continue as
board chairman until March, when he reaches the company's mandatory
retirement age of 65 for elected officers.
   Barrett, who has been company president since 1982, will continue
in that position, Goodyear said.
   Goodyear said Barrett's election will help ensure an orderly
transition in top management.
   A native of Topeka, Kan., Barrett has been with Goodyear 35 years
and has been a company officer for 12 years, according to Goodyear.
   Mercer joined Goodyear in 1947 and has been an officer for the
company since 1976. He was elected president in 1978, chief
operating officer in 1980, vice chairman and CEO in 1982 and
chairman in 1983.

<HEAD>Pork Bellies Limit-Down on Oversupply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Pork futures prices plunged to limit-down levels Tuesday after a
late sell-off by traders worried that frozen pork bellies are piling
up at already overstocked warehouses.
   On other markets, treasury bond futures soared on rumors that
improving superpower relations _ exemplified by Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev's visit _ may ultimately mean lower U.S. defense
spending level and a meaningful cut in the budget deficit; grain and
soybeans futures prices finished sharply higher in the wake of one
trading firm's day-long trading machinations; and platinum futures
posted an impressive gain as gold and silver slipped slightly.
   ``We had quite a sell-off,'' said Chuck Levitt of Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., Chicago. ``But then, the pork complex has been like
water running upstream the last couple of sessions.''
   Levitt said generally good underlying cash prices for the pork
bellies at this time of year led many traders to view the futures
market as undervalued.
   ``But every Tuesday we get a report on warehouse supplies ... on
how much product is actually pouring into storage and we get some
liquidation. In this situation,'' he added, ``no one was around to
stick up for the markets.''
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange's out-of-town warehouse report,
released after the close of trading Tuesday, was even more bearish
than most traders expected. Stocks in 48 approved warehouses, which
represent the majority of bellies in storage nationwide, showed a
net gain of 7.2 million pounds over the previous week.
   At the Merc, live cattle settled .08 cent lower to .05 cent
higher, with the contrtact for delivery in December at 71.37 cents a
pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .35 cent lower, with January
at 82.25 cents a pound; hogs were .55 cent lower to .05 cent higher,
with December at 40.62 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were
1.32 cents to a limit-down 2 cents lower, with February at 43.57
cents a pound.
   Treasury bond futures went in the opposite direction at the
Chicago Board of Trade, settling 1 22@32 to 1 23@32 higher, with
December at 89 22@32.
   ``The dollar strengthened, but that was an incredibly strong move
in T-bonds with no real economic news,'' said Rich Sandor of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., Chicago.
   ``The rumors have it that Gorbachev will propose a unilateral
troop reduction, that he didn't come a couple thousand miles just to
have lunch. The market read that to mean there's the real potential
for lowered defense spending ... and a real move on lowering the
deficit not that far down the road.''
   Grain and soybean futures prices finished a day-long
roller-coaster ride on the upside at the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Iowa Grain Co., a Chicago-based speculative trading firm,
triggered a sharp dip in grain and soybean prices just one day
earlier by leading a sell-off.
   But Tuesday, the company bought soybeans early, setting off a
rally as traders followed the move. Iowa Grain then turned around
and sold beans, but after prices broke, reversed positions again and
started buying.
   Iowa Grain also bought wheat, setting off a rally in that pit.
   ``What would otherwise have been a dull market turned lively, and
the traders followed Iowa because they were calling the tune,'' said
Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds in Chicago.
   On the close, wheat was 4 cents to 8{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.19 a bushel; corn was 2{
cents to 5} cents higher with December at $2.58\ a bushel; oats were
3{ cents to 7\ cents higher with March at $1.98\ a bushel; soybeans
were 14 cents to 16 cents higher with January at $7.72 a bushel.
   Platinum closed 30 cents lower to $6.70 higher, with the December
contract at the New York Mercantile Exchange at $611.80 a troy
ounce. Gold, meanwhile, was $1.60 to $1.80 lower, with December at
$427.50 a troy ounce, and silver was 2 cents to 9 cents lower, with
the December conbtrract at the Comex at 616.1 cents a troy ounce.
   ``Gold and silver are retreating because of the strength of the
dollar and the bond market's performance,'' said Jack Barbanel,
director of futures trading for Gruntal & Co., New York.
   ``But platinum has a life of its own ... because of the demand
for the actual commodity.''

<TEXT>
   Blue Arrow PLC said Tuesday that Mitchell S.
Fromstein had resigned by mutual consent as president and chief
executive of its Manpower Inc. subsidiary, the world's largest
employment services concern.
   The London-based company said the 60-year-old Fromstein would be
replaced as chief executive by Antony G. Berry, Blue Arrow's
chairman and chief executive, and as president by William F. Markey
Jr., who had been chief executive of Blue Arrow's non-Manpower
operations in the United States.
   Blue Arrow acquired the Milwaukee-based Manpower in September
1987 for $1.3 billion, and kept Fromstein on to lead the subsidiary.
   Fromstein had been president and chief executive of Manpower
since 1976.
   David E. Atkins, deputy chairman of Blue Arrow, said the Blue
Arrow board and Fromstein ``ended up having irreconcilable
differences over how the group should be run'' and came to a mutual
agreement that Fromstein should resign.
   Atkins said the board wanted to blend some of the back office
operations of the parent company with those of Manpower but said
Fromstein ``was resistant to those changes.''
   A call was placed to Fromstein at the Milwaukee office, but he
was said to be traveling and was unavailable for comment.
   Atkins said no layoffs were planned and that Blue Arrow intended
to maintain Manpower's headquarters in Milwaukee. ``It may well
benefit from additional functions,'' he said.
   Markey, 49, has previously been a marketing executive with
General Foods and later founded Positions Inc., an employment search
firm that Blue Arrow acquired in 1986.
   Blue Arrow has 1,900 branches serving more than 300,000 clients
in 33 different countries. It expects to place more than 1.4 million
people this year in temporary and permanent positions in offices,
industry and marketing services.

<HEAD>Former RCA Chairman Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thornton F. Bradshaw, chairman of RCA Corp. from
1981 to 1986, died Tuesday night from a cerebral hemorrhage,
according to Thomas B. Ross, senior vice president of NBC News. He
was 71.
   Bradshaw suffered a cerebral hemorrhage Monday morning and died
at about 6:30 p.m. EST Tuesday at New York Hospital, said Ross, who
formerly was senior vice president of corporate affairs at RCA.
   Bradshaw retired from RCA following its merger into General
Electric Co.
   He was active until his death as chairman of the John D. and
Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the philanthropy that makes
so-called ``genius grants,'' large no-strings awards of money to
encourage talented individuals to work on projects free of financial
pressures.
   Bradshaw spent most of his business career with Atlantic
Richfield Corp., joining the oil company in 1956, when it was

of Rockefeller University.
   He is survived by his wife, Patricia Salter West, and by
Priscilla Page of Bryn Mawr, Pa.; Nancy Poor of Norwell, Mass.; and
Jonathan Bradshaw of Newbury Park, Calif., the children of his
24-year first marriage that ended in divorce in 1964.

<HEAD>OSHA Proposes $71,000 Fine Against Eastern For Unsafe Cadmium Dust

   The federal Occupational Safety and Health
Administration proposed fines Tuesday totaling $71,620 against
Eastern Airlines for alleged health violations involving exposure of
its workers to cadmium dust.
   OSHA inspectors found the alleged violations after an inspection
at the landing gear shop at Miami International Airport. The
inspection began June 7.
   Eastern officials will meet with OSHA Dec. 21 to discuss the
proposed fine, company spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said.
   Eastern last year took ``corrective measures to make sure no
employees were exposed to this substance'' by changing the procedure
for stripping landing gears, Ceremsak said.
   Following the OSHA inspection, Eastern sent workers potentially
exposed to cadium to hospitals for medical tests, Ceremsak said. The
tests determined the workers had suffered no toxic effects, she said.
   The Machinists union could not be reached for comment immediately.
   ``Cadmium has long been recognized as an industrial health hazard
that can cause serious kidney and lung damage and may cause
cancer,'' said Jose Sanchez, OSHA's Fort Lauderdale-area director.
``OSHA is committed to minimizing worker exposure to cadmium and
other harmful substances.''
   OSHA inspectors found employees who grind landing gear components
were exposed to cadmium dust levels up to 60 times the permissible
level. About 20 workers were employed in the area where the
conditions were found.
   The inspectors learned that in 1987, an Eastern environmental
health expert had recommended the installation of engineering
controls in the shop to limit cadmium dust exposure. But company
officials did not follow the recommendation, OSHA said.
   The agency cited Eastern for seven alleged ``willful
violations,'' proposing a $10,000 penalty for each _ the maximum
allowed by law. It also cited the airline for two alleged ``serious
violations,'' carrying fines of $900 and $720, for lesser
infractions.
   The willful violations allege the airline failed to: inform
workers they were exposed to cadmium; provide an effective
respiratory protection program; adequately test the respirators;
prohibit storage and consumption of food and beverages in areas
contaminated with cadmium dust; keep cadmium levels at or below the
mandated OSHA limits; and use engineering controls and exhaust
ventilation to control exposure to the dust.
   OSHA defines a willful violation as one in which the violator
either knew that a condition constituted a violation or was aware
that a hazardous condition existed and made no reasonable effort to
correct it. A serious condition is one in which there was a
substantial probability that a death or serious injury could occur
and the employer knew or should have known about it.
   Eastern has 15 working days to contest the citations and proposed
penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health
Review Commission.

<HEAD>Former Andersen Consultants Sue Over Competition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former consultants at Arthur Andersen & Co.
announced Tuesday they are suing the company, alleging that Andersen
is trying to damage a competing consulting firm they started.
   The lawsuit was announced by seven former employees, six of whom
left Andersen this year and started their own competing firm,
Information Consulting Group Inc., with the assistance of Saatchi &
Saatchi PLC of Britain.
   ``Andersen has embarked on a deliberate campaign to injure ICG,''
the group said in a statement. ``It has made false statements about
ICG and has threatened to sue employees, including secretaries, who
resign from Andersen and join ICG.''
   An Andersen spokesman who asked not to be identified said he had
not seen the lawsuit and could not comment directly on it.
   ``The Saatchi-backed ICG managing directors may be responding to
our success in expediting the information-gathering process in our
own suit against them,'' an Andersen statement said.
   Andersen has sued Saatchi and ICG, accusing them of trying to
force Andersen to sell at least part of its consulting business.
   The suit filed Tuesday by the former consultants charges that
Andersen owes them income, retirement benefits and their capital
contributions to Andersen. The group seeks a court-supervised
accounting to establish the exact amounts owed them.

   Reporters and wire editors at The Hour of
Norwalk voted Tuesday to join the International Newspaper Guild.
   Reporters and wire editors voted 25-4 to form Local 3 of the
Guild.
   The vote came nearly a year after reporters at the Hour began
organizing efforts.
   ``We had to drag the company kicking and screaming into the
1980s,'' said Michael McIntire, a reporter and one of the union
organizers.
   Richard E. Curran, the newspaper's general manager, declined to
comment on the vote when contacted by telephone Tuesday night.
   Gregory Tarr, another organizer, said negotiations on a contract
are expected to begin later this month.
