<TEXT>
   Yellowstone National Park
got its first significant rainfall since Memorial Day on Friday,
and the rain and cooler temperatures aided firefighters battling a
40,000-acre fire.
   In California, the pilot of a U.S. Forest Service plane was
killed Friday when his plane crashed while surveying a fire in the
Sequoia National Forest about 35 miles northeast of Bakersfield,
Calif., authorities said.
   Fires also burned in Idaho and Montana.
   Yellowstone received about two hours of intermittent rainfall
Friday.
   ``One short rain shower is not adequate to douse the fires. But
it does help increase humidity in the air and it helps slow the
fires down,'' said park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo.
   She said the temperature in Yellowstone cooled down Friday
afternoon, the wind slowed and firefighters made some progress in
their efforts to contain fires burning on nearly 200,000 acres of
the park.
   Park officials on Friday morning reopened a road between Madison
Junction and Old Faithful that had been closed Thursday because of
the fire and smoke.
   The fire, pushed east by winds whipping at up to 40 mph
Thursday, had crossed the road in several spots near Nez Perce
Creek as it grew by about 3,000 acres during the day.
   The fire's north edge was about 1{ miles south of the Madison
Junction campground, which remained open, and wind was pushing the
flames to the east into backcountry, Anzelmo said.
   The 20,260-acre Fan fire in the park's northwestern corner
remained inside containment lines and burning had slowed on the
Shoshone and Red fires, which had charred about 34,000 acres.
   Despite the fires, tourism in Yellowstone remains high, Anzelmo
said.
   ``We are continuing to see a very busy park with campgrounds and
hotels full each night,'' she said. ``But the last two days, there
have been fairly smoky conditions in the park and the vicinity, so
that has been difficult for everyone.''
   In Montana, cool, cloudy weather slowed a 2,800-acre fire
burning in the Elkhorn Mountains southeast of Helena Friday. Fire
crews continued the slow work of building fire lines by hand in
steep terrain, forest officials said. The cool weather also helped
125 firefighters battling an 8,000-acre grass and range fire
southeast of Dillon.
   In Idaho, fire crews carved a break line between the raging
4,000 Walker Creek fire and the southeastern town of Inkom on
Friday. Residents from 16 rural homes were evacuated Thursday when
flames whipped by 60 mph gusts swept over thousands of acres of
sage, grass and groves of trees. The families stayed away from
their homes Friday, and residents of 32 other homes were warned
they might have to leave their homes.
   No structures were lost and no injuries were reported.
   Hundreds of firefighters were strung out across the southern
part of the state against the worst of more than 75 fires started
by lightning Thursday.
   ``We're snowed under here just trying to get people on fires,''
Challis National Forest spokesman Jim James said. ``We're going to
be really thin on resources.''
   In the Nez Perce National Forest, where Thursday's storm sparked
20 new fires, some 180 firefighters tried to regain containment of
the 1,000-acre Ruby Rapids fire after wind-driven flames broke
through the containment line. Fire bosses hoped to recontain the
fire by day's end and control it Saturday.
   Crews finally controlled the stubborn 1,500-acre Spring Canyon
II fire in the Targhee National Forest near the Wyoming border
Thursday night, and fire bosses were hoping to begin demobilization
this weekend.

<TEXT>
   A vacationing couple stopped at a
fast-food restaurant and left with a 5-pound, 4-ounce baby girl
instead of the burger and fries they planned to purchase.
   Vanessa Megan Nelson, daughter of Robert and Karla Nelson of
Green Bay, was born Aug. 3 in a McDonald's restaurant in Magog,
Quebec, about 35 miles from the United States border.
   The child, the Nelsons' third, wasn't due until Sept. 1, Karla
Nelson said Wednesday.
   ``It was the weirdest vacation I ever had in my life,'' her
husband said.
   The couple was driving with their son Adam, 1, to the wedding of
Robert Nelson's brother in Boston when Mrs. Nelson said she had a
backache and asked her husband to stop at a restroom. They saw a
McDonald's sign and decided to stop for a bite to eat at the same
time.
   Mrs. Nelson, 33, who said she experienced no other signs of
labor, gave birth in the restroom and called for her husband. But
he had taken Adam back to the car to wait for her.
   Mrs. Nelson said she was trying to wash the baby in the restroom
sink when a young girl entered and then went for help.
   Meanwhile, after several minutes of waiting in the car, Nelson,
29, said he figured something was wrong and he and Adam returned to
the restaurant.
   ``I saw a bunch of people by the bathroom ... and my wife
holding a baby,'' he said. ``It was just a shock to me.'' A rescue
squad took Mrs. Nelson and the baby to a hospital.
   As word of the unusual birth spread, the story was relayed in
French on Quebec television and radio and in local newspapers,
Nelson said.
   The couple discovered through a television report translated for
them that the owner-operator of the restaurant, Joseph Scott, was
going to pay for their hospital and ambulance costs, which totaled
almost $1,700, Nelson said.
   Scott also paid for some baby clothes, diapers and an infant car
seat, according to Julie Caron, spokeswoman for Scott's restaurants.
   That was good news for the couple because they have no health
insurance. ``We would have paid so much a month like we do all our
other bills,'' Mrs. Nelson said.
   Nelson is a cook at the Downtowner in Green Bay, and his wife is
a hostess at a Marc's Big Boy, where she returned to work Thursday.

<HEAD>Oregon Town Refuses to Concede Shortest River Title to Montana</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LINCOLN CITY, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thanks to the meddling of a group of
sharp-eyed Montana fifth graders, Oregon's ``D River'' has lost its
30-year title as the world's shortest river, but not without a
fight from miffed local officials.
   Editors of the Guinness Book of World Records agreed to give the
title to the Roe River in Great Falls, Mont., after students there
spent the past school year researching the river, which flows
through a state park.
   The students concluded the Roe is 201 feet, far shorter than the
440-foot D River near Lincoln City, and submitted their evidence to
the Guinness editors.
   ``On the basis of that, the Roe River was shorter,'' assistant
editor Cyd Smith said from the publisher's New York office.
   News of the change was not well-received in Lincoln City,
however, where the D River has held the title of shortest named
river for 30 years.
   ``Where a river begins and ends may be in the eye of the
beholder,'' Mayor Dell Isham said Wednesday.
   In fact, Lincoln City now insists the D is only 120 feet long,
give or take 5 feet. City officials are preparing documentation to
convince Guinness editors that they were right the first time and
that the D River should regain its rightful title in the book's
1990 edition. The deadline is past for next year's edition.
   Of course, the question being asked in Great Falls is: How can a
river shrink from 440 feet to 120 feet? At first it was funny, but
fewer people are laughing now that it's clear Lincoln City is
serious.
   ``It's fun to a point, but it has no end when people can come
back and keep shortening it until it's kind of ridiculous,'' said
Susie Nardinger, the Great Falls teacher who led her class in the
river study.
   The Roe River's acceptance into the records book is a matter of
pride to the community's 60,000 residents, she said.
   ``Our students went about it perfectly innocently,'' she said.
``The victory has been marred because Oregon came out with its
claims and, in a sense, stole the limelight at the peak of their
success.''
   Signs soon will grace the banks of the Roe to proclaim its
world-class status. About 625 miles away in Lincoln City, similar
signs remain along the D River and there are no plans to remove
them.
   Isham says the dispute is simply a matter of setting the record
straight. Lincoln City insists previous estimates of the river's
length inaccurately measured from a point in the river that
actually is part of Devil's Lake.
   That point looked like part of the river because a landfill had
closed in the banks of the lake, Isham said.
   A spokesman for Gov. Neil Goldschmidt says the states' governors
could get out their yardsticks and settle the issue once and for
all.
   ``If it's a good, honest fight, we'll be there,'' Gregg Kantor
said. ``But it'll always be the shortest river in our hearts.''

   At a glance, these are among the latest economic developments:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PRIME RATE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Several major U.S. banks on Thursday raised their prime rate a
half percentage point to 10 percent, just two days after the
Federal Reserve boosted its discount rate to 6.5 percent from 6
percent to stave off inflation.
   The increase brings the prime rate to its highest level since
June 18, 1985, when it was lowered to 9.5 percent from 10 percent.
   It was the third time this year that banks have raised the
prime, used to calculate a range of fixed and adjustable rate
corporate and consumer loans.

<HEAD>RETAIL SALES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Retail sales climbed 0.5 percent in July, the third consecutive
monthly increase. Sales increased $632 million to a seasonally
adjusted $134.0 billion, but economists say rising interest rates
threaten to dampen even this modest growth in the months ahead.
   The rise followed increases of 0.4 percent in June and 0.8
percent in May.

<HEAD>CROP REPORT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department has reported that drought and high
temperatures have shriveled the harvest of the nation's No. 1 crop,
corn, to an estimated 4.48 billion bushels, down 37 percent from
7.06 billion bushels harvested in 1987.
   The drought will cause consumer food prices to go up an average
3 percent to 5 percent from 1987. Before the heat and dry weather,
USDA had expected a 1988 food price hike of 2 percent to 4 percent.

<HEAD>STOCK MARKET</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices hovered in a narrow range Thursday, struggling to
stabilize after the market's recent steep decline. Analysts said
the market's drop over the past week had pushed prices down to
levels where they attracted some buyers. But they also said
widespread concern persisted over the recent rise in interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had fallen nearly
00 points over the five previous sessions, on Thursday rose 5.16 to
2,039.30.

<HEAD>HOUSING ACTIVITY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The National Association of Realtors reported home prices soared
on the West Coast in the April-June period, propelled by that
region's booming economy, while prices lagged in depressed oil
areas.
   The median price of existing single-family homes jumped to
$204,000 in the Anaheim-Santa Ana area of Southern California, a
20.1 percent increase when compared with the second quarter of 1987.
   Los Angeles, with an appreciation rate of 19.1 percent, ranked
second in the nation and San Francisco, with an increase of 15.5
percent, was third.
   The steepest declines from a year ago were in Oklahoma City,
where the median resale price fell 12.7 percent to $56,900.
   Nationally, prices rose 3.4 percent to a median of $88,900,
meaning half of the houses sold for more and half for less.

   Anthony Goff, 22, and Shawn Kerr, 19, both of nearby Imperial,
were also ordered Thursday to spend five years on probation and 100

   Although the ewes were fed well and fertile, they were ``aloof''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: For Shultz, A Bad Week for Nicaragua Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz can point
to some recent successes around the world lately. Then there's
Nicaragua.
   While Shultz has seen progress in such areas as Afghanistan, the
Persian Gulf, Cambodia and southwestern Africa, this has been a
particularly bad week for the administration in Nicaragua.
   Shultz found little evidence of support either in Washington or
Latin America for his policies and considerable evidence that the
Contra rebels are becoming a spent force.
   As Shultz was winding up his 10-day hemispheric tour Wednesday,
the Senate for the first time since the Contra aid program began
was rejecting a proposal for military aid for the rebels.
   A Democratic package was approved instead that includes the
possibility of eventual military aid, but there are so many strings
attached that administration officials are viewing it as a defeat.
   For one thing, the legislation does not ensure weapons delivery
to Contras inside Nicaragua even if all the other considitions for
release are met.
   Meanwhile, the Contras themselves are looking more and more like
a refugee force than a fighting force. U.S. officials dispatched to
the border area of Honduras and Nicaragua on Monday were horrified
by new evidence of a policy gone awry.
   The last of a group of about 1,000 Nicaraguans, including 250
Contras and 750 Nicaraguan civilians, made it to the Honduran side
of the border area after an arduous weeks-long trek through rugged
terrain. Many were sick or hungry or both. Many were practically
naked, their boots and clothing having disintegrated along the
route.
   They went to the border because that's where the Reagan
administration, unable to send food to the rebels inside Nicaragua,
has set up feeding centers for Contras and other refugees from
Nicaragua's turmoil.
   Since the cease-fire in Nicaragua went into effect last March,
thousands of rebels have sought refuge in that area.
   The question of assessing blame for the plight of the Contras,
who oppose Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government, will be
debated for years to come. The Republicans will accuse the
Democrats of betraying a brave people who took up arms on the
promise of U.S. support. The Democrats will counter that the
commitment to start down that path was ill-advised to begin with.
   In any case, the peace process is moribund and the rebel cause
has never seemed more hopeless. In the absence of military aid for
the Contras, Shultz has sought alternate means of bringing pressure
to bear on the Sandinista government to encourage a democratic
evolution.
   At the start of his recent trip, he went to Guatemala, hoping to
come away with a joint statement from four friendly Central
American foreign ministers designed to prod the Sandinistas into
making democratic reforms.
   The effort did not bear fruit, partly because the most reluctant
of the four parties _ Guatemala and Costa Rica _ did not want to
sign a document that had the appearance of having a ``Made in
Washington`` label.
   Beyond that, the Soviet Union, which has been generally
accommodating in other Third World trouble spots, appears to have
dug in its heels in Nicaragua, rejecting U.S. appeals for a
reduction in military aid to the Sandinistas. At current delivery
rates, the Sandinistas will receive more than $300 million worth of
Soviet lethal aid this year, according to U.S. estimates.
   So the view here is that the Sandinistas, despite persistent
economic problems, are more entrenched than ever.
   They have unswerving support from Moscow and irresolute
opposition from the Reagan administration, which soon may have the
added burden of figuring out what to do with thousands of Contra
fighters-turned-refugees amassed along the border of Honduras and
Nicaragua, neither of which wants them.
   With no other obvious alternative, their best hope may be
obtaining a U.S. green card, a problem that President Reagan's
successor could well inherit.

<HEAD>Sleeping On Job At Nuclear Plant Sparks Record $1.25 Million Fine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A record $1.25 million fine against the
operator of a Pennsylvania nuclear plant whose workers slept on
duty is meant to wake up utilities and show them that such
violations carry a price, says a government regulator.
   Philadelphia Electric Co., operator of the dormant Peach Bottom
nuclear power plant in southeastern Pennsylvania, was hit Thursday
with the fine, the largest in Nuclear Regulatory Commission history.
   Sleeping on the job was so common at Peach Bottom that on one
occasion, a shift superintendent and three of the four reactor
operators all dozed at once, according to testimony by an NRC
official last year.
   The NRC also announced fines ranging from $500 to $1,000 against
the 33 present and former reactor operators _ the first such civil
penalties ever proposed for individual operators.
   It said the 33 fines ``involved sleeping and-or other acts of
inattention to duty'' at the plant on the Susquehanna River in
Delta, Pa.
   The NRC called the levies ``proposed fines,'' explaining that
both Philadelphia Electric and the operators have 30 days to either
admit or deny the alleged violations. If they deny the allegations,
the NRC staff will review their complaints before deciding whether
to uphold the penalties.
   Peach Bottom, which is capable of producing 1 million kilowatts
of electric power, was ordered shut down by the NRC on March 31,
1987. The commission said the plant posed ``an immediate threat to
the public health and safety.''
   James Taylor, the NRC's deputy executive director for regional
operations, said in a letter to Philadelphia Electric that the
commission recognized that the utility had made ``extensive
personnel changes'' since then and had ordered reactor operators
retrained.
   But Taylor said the fines were necessary to demonstrate to the
company and to other utilities ``the significance of the problem,
and to ensure that corrective actions are long lasting.''
   In addition, he said the NRC action should ``emphasize to all
licensees that, in addition to the cost of corrective action, a
licensee may face the additional costs of sanctions for significant
safety violations.''
   Philadelphia Electric officials said at a news conference in
Holtwood, Pa., that they had not decided whether to appeal the
record fine.
   ``We have a period of time to evaluate and make that decision.
We have not made it yet,'' Chairman Joseph F. Paquette Jr. said.
   Paquette said no rate increases would stem from the fine and
that the company does not expect to seek a rate hike until after
its Limerick II power plant in suburban Philadelphia becomes
operational, possibly in 1990.
   Philadelphia Electric spokesman William Jones said the company
was ``relieved that the enforcement issue is finally behind us and
that we may now fully focus our energies on the completion of the
Peach Bottom restart plan.''
   In addition to the fines, the commission barred the utility from
placing ``in any operational position'' three officials who were
top-level managers at the plant in 1987. The officials held the
positions of operations engineer, superintendent of operations and
plant manager.
   Corbin A. McNeill Jr., executive vice president for nuclear
operations, said the officials are still with the company, but they
have been assigned to other, non-nuclear responsibilities.
   The fine is the largest since Congress gave the NRC authority to
issue civil penalties in 1969. The previous high was a $900,000
fine against Toledo Edison Co. for an incident in which the
Davis-Besse nuclear plant in Ohio had a temporary loss of cooling
water.
   Pennsylvania Gov. Robert Casey told reporters in Harrisburg that
he was pleased with the fine, but wished the NRC had gone further
and suspended or revoked the licenses of control room operators.
   Philadelphia Electric, which still hopes to obtain NRC
permission to restart the plant, said the action has cost
shareholders $86 million because of the cost of purchasing
replacement power.
   Peach Bottom is owned by a group of utilities. Public Service
Electric & Gas Co. owns about 42.5 percent, Atlantic Electric Co.
and Delmarva Power & Light Co. own 7.5 percent each, and
Philadelphia Electric owns about 42.5 percent and operates the
plant.

<HEAD>Israel Eyes Export Market For The Birds</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Israel has begun breeding pigeons in a bid to
boost the popularity of the much-maligned bird, a poor man's
poultry considered a delicacy during biblical times.
   The Agriculture Ministry recently opened four pigeon nurseries
housing 800 pairs of the birds in the Jordan River Valley, the
Jerusalem Post said Thursday.
   Pigeon meat, more tender and pungent than chicken, was a favored
delicacy during the time of Jesus and around 500 B.C., when poor
people sacrificed the bird at Jewish temples.
   Pigeon meat has long been popular in Palestinian households,
where many families raise the birds to vary their menu and as a
cheap alternative to poultry.
   Zvi Karchi, who heads the Agriculture Ministry's research and
development department, said he hoped to popularize the bird in
Israel, where poultry is a dietary staple and Arab-style food is
common.
   The newspaper also quoted Karchi as saying he expected Israel to
successfully compete with pigeon exporters like the United States,
France and Hungary.

<TEXT>
   Of course President Reagan is playing
politics these days, George Bush's protestations notwithstanding.
Bush would have a lot more to lament if the White House were
playing it any other way.
   The vice president said the other day that he guessed it was
inevitable for people to see political motives behind Reagan's
decisions on Cabinet appointments, vetoes and policy decisions.
``But I certainly won't add any validity to the charge,'' Bush said.
   It really isn't much of a charge. It is so standard as to be an
election-year cliche. Politicians are always accusing each other of
playing politics, which is rather ironic since that's what they do
for a living.
   Besides, there's really nothing wrong with it. That is the way
issues are defined and put to the voters. If they don't like what
they see, they can vote for the other candidate.
   Presidents have not always been so helpful to their vice
presidents in campaigns to succeed them. Dwight D. Eisenhower
didn't do a lot for Richard M. Nixon in 1960. Lyndon B. Johnson's
handling of Vietnam war issues in his final months probably hurt
Hubert H. Humphrey's ticket in 1968.
   Both those vice presidents lost.
   No president can deliver nomination, let alone election, to his
vice president or any other candidate. But presidents certainly can
help, and Reagan is.
   He has promised Bush two campaign appearances a week from Labor
Day on, and his White House actions in these waning days of his
administration are at least as significant an assist.
   ``I'm just still working on the job here,'' Reagan said Tuesday
when questions were raised about political motivation in his
appointment of a Hispanic educator to become secretary of
education. A month earlier, the vice president had promised an
association of Latin citizens that he would choose a Hispanic for a
seat in a Bush Cabinet.
   Bush said he was consulted before Lauro F. Cavazos, president of
Texas Tech University, was appointed to the education post. But he
said he wasn't claiming credit or responsibility for it.
   The influence, or interests, of the vice president were evident
in an assortment of other Reagan moves, including:
   _His decision not to veto a bill to require advance notice to
workers when there are to be plant closings or major layoffs.
Reagan let the bill become law without his signature, rather than
revive an issue the Democrats welcomed in congressional as well as
presidential politics.
   _The selection of Nicholas F. Brady, a Bush confidant, to become
secretary of the treasury, succeeding James A. Baker III, who left
the Cabinet to take command of the Bush campaign.
   _The veto of a $299.5 billion defense budget bill on grounds it
sought to lock the administration into weapons programs favored by
the Democrats. Defense and foreign policy are issues on which Bush
believes he can master Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis; the veto guarantees a new round of action on defense
spending during the campaign.
   _The signing on Wednesday of a bill to pay reparations to
Japanese Americans because of internments during World War II.
That's particularly significant in California, which is where Bush
endorsed the idea during the primary election campaign. Reagan
originally objected to the cost, but embraced a bill with a ceiling
on appropriations.
   _An apparent switch in signals on a Contra aid bill that passed
the Senate Wednesday night over solid Republican opposition. The
Democratic bill provides $27 million in so-called humanitarian aid,
but no arms for Contras fighting the government of Nicaragua. The
military aid issue was left open for possible action later.
   Bush favors the full array of Contra aid. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
the Democratic vice presidential nominee, has voted for it in the
past. Dukakis is opposed to military aid to the Contras. Republican
campaigners don't want that ticket split forgotten.
   Not that the Democrats are without resources of their own. They
do run Congress, and as opportunities arise this fall, they will
use that control to the advantage of their candidates and the
disadvantage of Republicans.
   And, in turn, Republicans will accuse them of playing politics.

   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar has won the 1987 Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International
Understanding, India's U.N. ambassador announced.
   The prize has been awarded annually since 1965 for outstanding
contributions to international understanding, said Ambassador C.R.
Gharekahn on Thursday.
   He said it reflects general achievements, but he specifically
mentioned the secretary-general's role in negotiating a cease-fire
between Iran and Iraq. The truce is to take effect Aug. 20.
   The award includes a cash prize of about $110,000. A jury of
Indian officials selects the winner.
   The ambassador said Perez de Cuellar had agreed to come to New
Delhi for presentation of the prize, but a date had not been set.
   The award is named after Nehru, post-colonial India's first
prime minister.
   Previous winners include former U.N. Secretary-General U Thant,
U.S. civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., missionary Mother
Teresa, Dr. Jonas Salk who developed a polio vaccine, South African
activist Nelson Mandela, Indian leader Indira Gandhi, and Swedish
Prime Minister Olof Palme.

<TEXT>
   More than three months after her
death, the body of Ferdinand Marcos' mother is still unburied as
her son's dwindling followers maintain a wake in hopes the
government will allow him to come home.
   But civic leaders say that even here in ``Marcos country,'' many
believe the time has come to place the body of Josefa
Edralin-Marcos in the marble tomb prepared for her in the family
cemetery in a swamp on the eastern edge of this town.
   Mrs. Edralin-Marcos died May 4 at age 95, and her body was
transferred the following month from Manila to the Marcos ancestral
home in Batac, a town of about 50,000 people about 240 miles to the
north.
   Family members and Marcos supporters say no date for the burial
will be set until President Corazon Aquino allows her deposed
predecessor to return or until Marcos orders the interment.
   The body has been embalmed at least twice, and Marcos family
mortician Frank Malabed said the remains could remain unburied
until the end of the year.
   The former president has lived in Hawaii since a
civilian-military uprising toppled his 20-year administration in
1986. Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow him back for security
reasons.
   ``To be frank with you, we have not been able to set a definite
date,'' said Marcos' sister Fortuna Barba, who attends daily prayer
services before the open coffin in the family home. The mansion is
now a museum.
   Pictures of Marcos and his wife, Imelda, hang from the walls
alongside banners such as: ``God's will, I'll return to save my
nation and people from communism.''
   ``We're still hoping, perhaps against hope, that the situation
will change and something good may come out of it,'' Mrs. Barba
said.
   Whatever sympathy Marcos may have hoped to generate by his
appeal to come home appears to have dissipated in the months
following his mother's death.
   Filipino newspapers rarely mention the ongoing wake. In a rare
exception, The Manila Chronicle recently suggested an epitaph:
``Here lies Dona Josefa Marcos, died at age 95, buried at age 96.''
   Rodolfo Farinas, provincial governor of Ilocos Norte and a close
friend of the Marcos family, said if Marcos believes he has no
chance to return, ``he should give the word that his mother should
be laid to rest.''
   The Rev. Ruben Abaya, a Roman Catholic priest, said the arrival
of Mrs. Edralin-Marcos' body generated considerable enthusiasm in
Batac because many believed Marcos was returning for the funeral.
   Pro-Marcos politicians erected red, white and blue signs in
Batac and in neighboring towns welcoming the former president to
his provincial stronghold.
   But as the weeks dragged on without the Apo, or Grand Old Man,
both the signs and the enthusiasm are fading.
   Under a rotation system, residents take turns attending daily
prayers before the casket. But attendance has dwindled from
hundreds to a few dozens each day.
   ``The feeling seems to be that the woman has suffered enough and
should be laid to rest,'' Abaya said.
   Vice Mayor Rodolfo Yadao, a member of Marcos' New Society
Movement party, said townspeople were still eager for Marcos to
return.
   Yadao said, however, that townspeople were losing patience with
his nearly fanatical supporters from Manila who came here for the
wake.
   ``We have to provide for them,'' Yadao said. ``Sometimes, they
are quarelling with themselves. She should be buried now. That is
our tradition.'' He was referring to the practice of burying people
within nine days of death.
   At Laoag International Airport, about six miles north, the
military has placed metal barricades, mounds of gravel and six
concrete abutments on the runway, shortening it by 1,200 yards to
prevent Marcos from slipping in on a charter flight from abroad.
   Some Marcos supporters vow to continue the wake indefinitely
until their leader returns.
   But asked if the family were prepared for an indefinite
standoff, Mrs. Barba replied: ``Well, I suppose if there is no
hope, I'll get a call from him one day telling me to go ahead with
it.''

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Major Parts of FBI Agent's Racial Harassment Suit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Major portions of a black FBI agent's racial
harassment lawsuit against the government have been dismissed as
technically defective, but the plaintiff's lawyer says the ruling
ultimately will be a victory.
   Attorney David Kairys said many of the legal flaws found by U.S.
District Judge Charles R. Richey in agent Donald Rochon's complaint
can be corrected and the case will go forward.
   The Philadelphia lawyer said Richey's order Thursday leaves the
essential element of the case intact.
   ``He has upheld our ability to get personal damages against the
individual wrongdoers,'' Kairys said. ``This is very important and
was not a matter of certainty when we started this.''
   In a highly technical opinion, Richey dismissed ``without
prejudice'' most of the claims against 21 white FBI agents, whom
Rochon contends engaged in a three-year campaign of harassment that
included anonymous telephone calls, obscene mail and death threats.
Rochon also contends agents threatened his white wife with sexual
assault.
   The ``without prejudice'' proviso Richey attached to most of the
dismissals gives Rochon an opportunity to file a new complaint to
try to correct the legal defects identified by the judge.
   Richey said the complaint, while raising ``repugnant and
chilling'' allegations, ``contains defects in both pleading and
legal theory that constrain the court to dismiss many of the
plaintiff's claims.''
   The judge, however, refused to dismiss common-law claims against
three white Chicago FBI agents _ Gary W. Miller, Thomas Dillon and
Kenneth Veach _ whom Rochon said spearheaded harassment when he
worked in that city.
   Richey also refused to dismiss Rochon's claim that his civil
rights were violated under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
But he dismissed 21 FBI agents and top officials as defendants in
that claim, saying only the attorney general could be sued as head
of Rochon's agency.
   He also found that many of Rochon's claims against individual
agents, particularly supervisors who allegedly ignored the racial
harassment complaints, were pre-empted under other statutes by the
Title VII claim.
   Kairys chose to hail Richey's decision to preserve the civil
rights claim, saying it was the vehicle for the overall harassment
and discrimination complaint.
   ``The individuals, at least temporarily, some of them, are off
the hook, but the judge has clearly said the only problem is he
doesn't want Title VII and allegations about the individuals to be
merged,'' Kairys said.
   ``That is just a matter of filing an amended complaint which
separates them,'' he said.
   But Kairys conceded he will have difficulty sustaining claims
against the FBI supervisors and managers that Rochon claims
deliberately ignored his complaints.
   Kairys said he was gratified by Richey's stern warning to the
defendants to stop referring to the racial harassment incidents as
``pranks.''
   ``This utter lack of sensitivity is almost as disturbing as the
alleged acts themselves,'' Richey said, adding that ``the court
hereby warns defendants that a modicum of decency is expected for
all those who file pleadings in this court.''
   Kairys said, ``The judge really recognized how inappropriate it
has been for the FBI and the Department of Justice and their
lawyers to fail to acknowledge that something other than pranks
occurred here.''
   The judge also dismissed altogether complaints against three
agents arising from alleged racial harassment incidents when Rochon
worked in the FBI's Omaha, Neb., field office in 1983 and 1984.
Richey found that the statute of limitations had expired on those
claims.
   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission upheld many of
Rochon's complaints about harassment in Omaha. The EEOC's
investigation of the Chicago incidents was suspended after the suit
was filed.
   Rochon, 38, now works in the bureau's Philadelphia office.
   Miller, who admitted during an internal investigation that he
forged Rochon's signature on an application for ``death and
dismemberment'' insurance, is the subject of a grand jury
investigation.
   The insurance policy was sent to Rochon's home as part of what
Miller called an attempt to get ``retribution'' for the black
agent's complaints of racial harassment. Miller was suspended for
two weeks without pay but fellow white agents took a collection to
pay his salary, according to statements made in court.

<TEXT>
   Federal investigators are trying to determine
why a jetliner was flying at the wrong altitude over the North
Atlantic and almost collided with another jetliner earlier this
week.
   Word of the incident emerged Thursday when the National
Transportation Safety Board said it was investigating a report
filed by one of the pilots, who estimated the two aircraft came
within 200 to 300 feet of each other.
   The incident last Monday occurred about 700 miles east of Boston
and involved Lockheed L-1011 jetliners flown by American Trans Air,
a U.S. charter airline, and LuftTransport, a West German charter
carrier, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.
   Capt. Richard Reb, the American Trans Air pilot, said he was
talking to his co-pilot when he suddenly saw the other plane
through a side window of the cockpit. He immediately lowered the
nose of his plane and descended 1,000 feet, according to an airline
spokesman.
   At the time, both jets were cruising at about 550 miles per hour
at 35,000 feet with American Trans Air Flight 665 flying directly
west and the LuftTransport Flight 410 heading southwest and
converging, according to government and airline officials. The FAA
said the LuftTransport plane should have been flying at 31,000 feet.
   Flight 665 with 250 passengers and 12 crew members was bound
from Lisbon, Portugal, to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport, said
David Recker, executive vice president of American Trans Air, which
is based in Indianapolis.
   It could not immediately be determined how many people were
aboard the other plane, but such European charter flights normally
are heavily booked during the summer months, according to aviation
experts. The LuftTransport jet was bound from Frankfurt to Cancun,
Mexico.
   The airspace over the ocean where the incident occurred is not
covered by radar, but jetliners are assigned specific routes, speed
and altitude by controllers at Gander, Newfoundland, and at New
York.
   According to the FAA, the West German plane had just left
airspace controlled by the Gander controllers and entered airspace
controlled by the FAA's New York control center when the incident
occurred.
   ``The (German) plane should have descended to 31,000 feet before
it entered New York airspace,'' said FAA spokesman John Leyden.
   Leyden said preliminary reports indicate that both planes were
flying the proper route but that ``it looks like a case of the
wrong altitude'' on the part of the LuftTransport plane.
   FAA and NTSB investigators planned to interview controllers at
both New York and Gander to determine whether the LuftTransport
pilot was assigned the wrong altitude.
   Leyden said both pilots saw the other aircraft.
   ``It was close and it's kind of frightening,'' said Recker. He
said no one aboard the American Trans Air plane was injured during
the incident and that it was over before the passengers were aware
of anything unusual.
   LuftTransport is based in Dusseldorf, West Germany, according to
the FAA.

<HEAD>Congress Moves On Medical Waste Issue Before Returning Home For
Recess</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers took several steps to fight the
ocean dumping of medical waste before heading back to districts
where waves of the infectious debris have marred the summer for
East Coast resort towns and vacationers.
   A House subcommittee voted Thursday to stiffen federal penalties
for illegal dumping as Congress prepared to leave town for the
August recess, and other lawmakers drafted separate measures to
track hospital debris and make violators financially liable for
lost revenue to coastal communities.
   Meanwhile, Vice President George Bush injected the topic into
presidential politics, calling on Attorney General-designate
Richard Thornburgh to determine if the FBI can be used to
strengthen government anti-pollution enforcement.
   ``Our ocean should not be a dumping ground,'' the vice president
said.
   Bush called medical waste floating up on East Coast beaches a
``national disgrace'' and termed the situation ``dangerous,'' just
two days after the Reagan administration told Congress that
``guidance and education'' _ not new rules on disposal of medical
waste _ were the answer.
   Environmental Protection Agency officials on Tuesday had told a
House panel that they believe the debris does not pose a major
health threat.
   In Congress, the House Judiciary subcommittee on crime approved
legislation that would create a specific federal law against
medical waste dumping, carrying penalties up to five years in
prison, $250,000 in fines and forfeiture of assets such as ships
used in illegal dumping.
   Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J., the subcommittee chairman and
sponsor of the bill, said current laws do not address medical waste
dumping specifically and do not cover dumping in all circumstances.
   ``Even if they are apprehended, the current penalties amount to
little more than a slap on the wrist,'' said Hughes, who represents
Jersey shore communities. ``By making illegal medical waste
disposal a federal criminal offense, we will be raising the stakes
considerably.''
   Rep. Gerry E. Studds, D-Mass., who represents resort towns on
Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, introduced legislation
similar to Hughes' bill, but also including a liability provision.
   Under the Studds measure, state and local governments would be
able to recover lost tax revenues from violators. In addition,
coastal homeowners could recover for damaged property and fishermen
and tourist-related businesses could recover for lost business due
to medical waste.
   ``While the medical risk associated with this debris is fairly
low, it is intolerable that garbage finds its way into the ocean
and onto our shores,'' said Studds, chairman of the House Merchant
Marine and Fisheries subcommittee on fisheries and the environment.
   Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, D-Conn., filed legislation calling for a
manifest system to track medical waste produced in Connecticut. The
Senate last week passed a similar pilot program proposal for
Connecticut, New York and New Jersey.
   The federal government has no mandatory tracking system, and EPA
officials have said they will continue with voluntary efforts
instead of imposing regulations.
   Jeffrey D. Denit, head of EPA's office of solid waste, said the
agency would use ``education and guidance'' to discourage companies
from dumping medical waste at sea.

<HEAD>Bush Has Cash To Spare For His Small Share Of Convention Cost</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush comes to the Republican
convention with more money than anticipated after rationing
everything from plane travel to office supplies to keep from going
over the federal cap on spending, his staff says.
   Although Bush doesn't have to worry about paying for the
multimillion-dollar Superdome convention, he does have to pay
related campaign costs such as housing and staff payroll.
   To make those ends meet, Bush has been forced to keep a tight
rein on campaign spending over the past few months to stay under
the $23 million primary spending limit that is set for presidential
campaigns.
   Candidates are allowed more than $4 million on top of that for
fund-raising costs, which Bush also raised and spent.
   Entering the last six weeks of the campaign, Bush began July
with less than $1 million to go before hitting the limit.
   He has only to make it through his nomination Wednesday night to
get $46 million from the federal treasury for his fall race against
Democrat Michael Dukakis. Until then, his campaign is ruled by the
primary limit.
   ``We've been penny-pinchers all along and we're very careful
with our finances,'` said finance spokeswoman Ede Holiday, who
added, ``Obviously we are very close to our spending limit.''
   She declined to say how close.
   Four Democratic state chairmen have accused Bush of overspending
the limit and filed a complaint with the Federal Election
Commission last week.
   Holiday said the campaign kept a tight budget that, as planned,
will last just through the convention.
   ``We have plenty of money to do what we want to do at the
convention,'' she said.
   Holiday would not say how much the campaign was spending for
convention activity, but said the belt-tightening in recent weeks
has left more money to spend on the convention than originally
anticipated.
   One campaign official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
it was well in excess of the $300,000 that Democrat Michael
Dukakis' staff says he spent at the Democrats' convention in
Atlanta last month.
   Some of the Bush staff are working voluntarily until they go on
the general election payroll after the nomination, said Holiday.
   Staff members have talked about having to scrimp on office
supplies, and Bush restricted his travel sharply in the waning
weeks of the campaign to keep from topping the limit.
   The lion's share of the extravaganza in New Orleans _ including
the convention itself, communications equipment and Bush office
space in the Superdome, and balloons and banners _ will be paid for
by the Republican National Committee, and to a lesser degree the
local host committee.
   The Republicans, as the Democrats did in Atlanta, receive $9.2
million from the federal treasury to put on their conventions.
   The money comes from the same taxpayer-supported federal fund
that doles out primary matching money to the candidates and gives
each general election candidate $46 million.
   Mary Mead, deputy convention manager for communications, said
most of the money went into construction and logistics costs, while
many of the decorations inside and outside the hall were paid for
by the city of New Orleans.
   The Louisiana Host Committee's efforts centered on promoting New
Orleans through such projects as decorating the airport, providing
media kits about the area, and plastering the city with banners and
billboards reading ``New Orleans, Host to the Future and the 1988
Republican Convention,'' said Bonnie Hymel, executive director of
the committee's media and hospitality effort.

<HEAD>NRA Attacks Congressional Backers of Handgun Waiting Period</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Rifle Association has served
notice that even its strongest backers will feel its wrath if they
support legislation to require a seven-day waiting period when
buying a handgun.
   NRA letters mailed across the country urge the gun lobby's
supporters to pressure members of Congress to defeat the measure.
   But even conservative Republicans who call themselves NRA
supporters said Thursday that the mailings contain factual
distortions, and some of the GOP members are downright angry.
   ``They ought to stop beating up on their friends,'' said Rep.
John J. Rhodes III, R-Ariz., who is undecided on the legislation.
``They are really screwing up their credibility with people who
supported them for a long, long time.''
   The NRA especially angered Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr.,
R-Wis., who said the organization's letter attacking him personally
is ``downright erroneous, false and plays on hysteria in an attempt
to get me to change my vote.''
   Sensenbrenner said he supports the waiting period and won't
change his mind.
   The NRA official who signed the letters, Wayne LaPierre, said
Sensenbrenner was singled out because he wrote his constituents
proclaiming his support for the right to keep and bear arms.
   ``You don't have it both ways,'' said LaPierre, director of the
NRA's Institute for Legislative Action. ``Everybody knows this is a
big gun vote. You're either for gun owners or against gun owners.
   ``If someone is going to vote for a bill that takes these rights
away ... we're going to fight back. That's what sportsmen and gun
owners expect us to do.''
   The waiting period measure, part of omnibus drug legislation
that the House will vote on in September, would require a seven-day
wait in the purchase of a handgun from a licensed dealer.
   The dealer must send to law enforcement authorities a sworn
statement that includes a description of the gun, the serial
number, and the name, address and birth date of the buyer. Police
may, but are not required to, conduct a background check.
   Purchasers who would be prohibited from buying handguns would be
those already ineligible under existing federal law: convicted
felons, fugitives from justice, illegal aliens, drug addicts, those
adjudicated mentally ill or committed to a mental institution,
those dishonorably discharged from the military and people under
indictment for a felony.
   Twenty-two states already have enacted a waiting period of
varying duration.
   The NRA contends the waiting period would amount to a national
registration of handguns, would cost ``hundreds of millions'' of
dollars to enforce, and would require ``a bureaucrat's permission''
to buy a gun.
   Conservatives and liberals alike said all these assertions were
wrong.
   But conservative House members targeted for pressure said that
perhaps the ultimate insult was the NRA's attempt to link them to
liberals who support gun control.
   LaPierre wrote Sensenbrenner's constituents: ``I have in my hand
a letter dated July 1988 from the Sensenbrenner Campaign Committee
for Re-Election proclaiming his fight for gun owners' rights ...
HA. With support like that, you might as well have Ted Kennedy
representing you.''
   Kennedy, D-Mass., is one of the most liberal senators and is a
strong supporter of handgun control.
   While other versions of the letter do not attack individual
lawmakers, they make the same points about the legislation.
   The NRA contended that backers of the bill ``want the police to
visit your home before you can buy a firearm, yet police right now
don't have the resources to send cruisers to investigate
residential burglaries in many areas.''
   LaPierre defended the statement even though no such language is
in the bill. He said it was a response to statements made by
backers of the legislation that police would drive by homes to
check addresses on a gun purchaser's forms.
   Responding to a criticism of Sensenbrenner, LaPierre
acknowledged that the NRA supported waiting periods in the early
1970s, but changed its mind a few years later when it found ``they
don't stop crime. It's simply red tape for honest people.''
   Other lawmakers angered by the NRA campaign included Rep. Dan
Lungren, R-Calif., a Judiciary Committee member who has backed past
NRA positions; and Rep. Herbert H. Bateman, R-Va., who considers
himself a strong supporter of the right to own guns.
   Lungren called the attack on Sensenbrenner ``a pretty desperate
letter against one of their supporters.''
   Bateman said, ``I am shocked and disappointed at the excessive
language and tactics used by the NRA in the letter to my
constituents.''

   Vice President George Bush and House Speaker
Jim Wright locked horns at a Washington dinner party after Wright
said he was ``surprised and hurt'' that Bush had called for a
special prosecutor to investigate ethics charges against him.
   Aides to the two officials described the Wednesday night episode
after insisting on anonymity. They said Bush retorted by
complaining about the Democratic convention, where speakers
referred to Bush as ``a toothache of a man'' and taunted ``Where
was George?'' in suggesting he was an invisible vice president.
   The aides provided differing descriptions of the intensity of
the exchange, which occurred at the annual House Gym Dinner given
for members of Congress who use the House athletic facilities.
   ``It was a polite, private discussion, not a heated exchange, no
profanities,'' said the Wright aide. In contrast, the Bush aide
said:
   ``It was quite a heated exchange with a lot of witnesses. Wright
started screaming and yelling that he (Bush) had impugned his
(Wright's) integrity.'' The Bush aide said Wright used profanities.
   Wright called Bush on Thursday, but not to apologize, Wright's
aide said. The aide said Wright ``reassured him there was no
personal animosity of any sort,'' and the two agreed they could
``make contributions by maintaining a high standard in their
personal relationship.''
   Sheila Tate, the campaign press secretary to the vice president,
said, ``Bush told me this morning, `If you get any calls, you can
be authorized to say that I talked to the speaker this morning and
I appreciated his call.'''
   Wright and Bush have known each other since the 1960s, when they
served together in the House as junior congressmen from Texas.
   Wright's aide said Bush approached the speaker at the dinner and
asked how he was doing. The speaker said he was disappointed in
Bush for calling for a special prosecutor to investigate Wright on
ethical issues, particularly the financial arrangements involving
the publication of a book by Wright and reports that the speaker
had tried to get special treatment for Texas bankers. Wright's
actions are being investigated by a special counsel to the House
ethics committee.
   Wright's aide said the speaker has ``always enjoyed a personal
rapport with Bush'' and has never had any personal harsh feelings
toward him.
   ``On a number of occasions, including one with the press, he had
defended Bush from what Wright considered unwarranted attacks and
bum attacks.'' He said Wright in front of reporters defended Bush
from charges of being a wimp, and the next week Bush called for the
special prosecutor and ``came out with his attacks on Wright.''
   ``Last night, Wright reminded him of his defenses of Bush, and
told Bush that should Bush be elected president, Wright would be
speaker, and the two would have to work together,'' the aide said.
``Wright never engaged in any personal attacks on Bush (and he) was
surprised and hurt Bush gratuitously had gone out of his way to
attack Wright personally.
   ``He said he had no personal hostility toward Bush. He was glad
he had spoken to him. That's what a friend should do if he felt
that another friend had let him down or done him injury.''

   Those who follow the rapidly moving
events are uncertain of the outcome in Burma, where unarmed
citizens are angry enough to confront rifles and the government is
willing to shoot them down.
   Diplomats and other observers sketch a variety of finales to the
drama that began with President Sein Lwin's accession to power late
last month and has progressed through increasing levels of popular
protest and violence.
   Security forces initially were restrained and disciplined, but
soldiers opened fire Tuesday on thousands of demonstrators in the
streets of Rangoon. Official reports say protest has spread to
virtually every town and city in the the Southeast Asian nation of
38 million people.
   High school students in their mid-teens were the vanguard but
witnesses say Buddhist monks, workers and ordinary townspeople have
joined the mass denunciation of 26 years of authoritarian rule and
economic deprivation.
   These are some of the results foreseen by diplomats in scenarios
by diplomats in Rangoon and Bangkok:
   _ Continued ruthless suppression of all protest by Sein Lwin and
a loyal army until all opponents are rooted out or cowed into the
passivity that characterized the political scene until recent
events.
   _ The ouster of Sein Lwin by former strongman Ne Win, who
overthrew the democracy in 1962. He formally retired from political
life last month, but some believe he still pulls the strings.
   _ An intensified and bloody uprising that would compel the army,
Burma's most powerful institution, to overthrow the government and
install a more moderate leadership.
   Unlike the Philippines or South Korea, where mass popular
protest achieved greater political freedom, Burma has no prominent
personalities advocating democracy who could lead the growing but
diffuse opposition.
   Aung Gyi, the most outspoken critic of the system, is 70 and
retired from politics after falling out with Ne Win in the early
1960s. Sein Lwin has jailed the former army officer, a relative
liberal.
   Protesters seem to illustrate this dearth of political
alternatives by resurrecting old symbols and the images of leaders
long dead.
   Rangoon marchers carry portraits of Aung San, the dashing
fighter for Burmese independence who was assassinated in 1947, and
wave the peacock flag of days when Burma struggled against its
British colonial masters.
   Like the Philippines under Ferdinand E. Marcos, Burma has a
strong military in which increasing disaffection is reported. Some
diplomats speculate that elements of the army, as in the ``people
power'' revolution that ousted Marcos, could provide the muscle to
bring down Sein Lwin, a former general.
   The military has been Burma's privileged class since Ne Win
seized power, however. Retired or active military officers
currently hold all but two Cabinet positions, and even the rank and
file has privileges civilians do not enjoy.
   Ne Win assiduously built, or bought, the loyalty of a generation
and more of army officers. Although his proclaimed ideology has
been a mix of socialist economics, Buddhism and isolationism,
political control has rested with the military and the
army-dominated government political party.
   ``I find it hard to believe such a man steeped in power since
1962 giving it all up in one fell swoop. Something smells here,''
said a Western diplomat based in Rangoon who spoke on the condition
he not be identified.
   He added, however, that if Ne Win returned the question remained
whether the people now would accept ``the lesser of two evils''
even if he pursued urgently needed economic reforms.
   Some protesters still call the government the ``Ne Win regime''
and demand restoration of democracy. Marchers applauded loudly this
week when passing the U.S. Embassy in Rangoon.
   Others say they are fighting for socialism minus Sein Lwin, who
is widely hated for ruthlessly suppressing dissent since the 1960s.
   ``The young people haven't known anything in their lives but
this system,'' a Burmese intellectual said recently. ``They don't
know exactly what they want or how to get it.''
   Many Westerners arriving from Rangoon say Burmese from many
walks seem certain of one thing: They have had enough of leaders
who provide neither freedom nor rice.

   Here is a sketch of Richard L. Thornburgh,
confirmed by the Senate to succeed Edwin Meese III as attorney
general:
   AGE: 56.
   FAMILY: The son of an engineer and grandson of a university
professor, Thornburgh is married to the former Virginia Judson, a
schoolteacher. His first wife, also named Virginia, was killed in
an automobile accident in 1960 that left the youngest of his three
sons brain-damaged. Thornburgh now has a fourth son by his second
wife, whom he married in 1963.
   EDUCATION: He earned a civil engineering degree from Yale
University in 1954. He returned to his native Pittsburgh and earned
a law degree from the University of Pittsburgh Law School in 1957.
   JOB HISTORY: He was appointed U.S. attorney for western
Pennsylvania in 1969. As a prosecutor, his targets included a U.S.
customs agent, a county sheriff and a former Republican
congressman, J. Irving Whalley, who was convicted in a kickback
case. In 1975, he was appointed by President Ford as assistant
attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's criminal
division.
   In 1978, the Republican Thornburgh defeated former Pittsburgh
Mayor Pete Flaherty for governor. He ran on a platform of cleaning
up corruption in the Democratic administration of then-Gov. Milton
Shapp, a Democrat. He was re-elected in 1982, narrowly defeating
former congressman Allen Ertel during a recession that made it
difficult for incumbent GOP candidates.
   Barred by law from seeking a third term, Thornburgh left
Pennsylvania at the end of 1986 to head the Institute of Politics
at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.
   POSITIONS AS GOVERNOR: Thornburgh's budget proposals held
spending increases to less than the rate of inflation for eight
straight years. He championed a controversial welfare reform law
that limited cash benefits to three months a year for an estimated
68,000 people considered ''able-bodied.''
   A sampling of his positions:
   _On abortion, Thornburgh has a mixed record. In December 1981,
he vetoed an Abortion Control Act, saying he objected to sections
that said life started at conception, that mandated a 24-hour
waiting period, and that would have established criminal penalties
for doctors who broke the law.
   On June 11, 1982, however, Thornburgh signed a watered-down
version of the abortion bill, which required doctors to notify
women about the risks of abortion and the availability of medical
assistance for prenatal care and childbirth. Portions of the law
were later struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court.
   _On capital punishment, Thornburgh said during both terms in
office that he favored the death penalty for certain murders and
for persons convicted of killing police officers and prison guards.
During his first term, the death penalty was reinstated in
Pennsylvania. During his second term, Thornburgh signed warrants
setting execution dates for several convicted murderers. Appeals
courts granted stays in each case.
   _On gun control, Thornburgh said while campaigning for his first
term that he opposed further government regulation of the sale or
purchase of firearms. Subsequent public statements on this issue
could not be found. While governor, Thornburgh signed a bill
setting a mandatory five-year sentence for any person convicted of
using a gun during a crime.

<TEXT>
   Although the main order of business of the
four-day Republican National Convention next week is to nominate
George Bush for president, all of his vanquished rivals will get
some time in the spotlight.
   Kansas Sen. Bob Dole, New York Rep. Jack Kemp and television
evangelist Pat Robertson are to speak in prime time, according to a
draft of the convention schedule released Thursday by the
Republican National Committee.
   The others _ former Secretary of State Alexander Haig and former
Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont _ will address the 2,277 GOP delegates
on Monday, just before Maureen Reagan, the president's daughter and
co-chairman of the Republican National Committee.
   Russian comic Yakov Smirnoff will kick off the convention Monday
morning by leading the delegates in the pledge of allegiance. Other
celebrities scheduled to recite the pledge later in the week during
prime time include musician Lionel Hampton and Charlton Heston.
   The president _ in his farewell convention address _ will speak
Monday night, following a tribute to his wife, Nancy.
   Actress Helen Hayes will participate in a salute to senior
citizens during the Tuesday morning session before the delegates
get down to the work of dealing with reports from the convention's
committees.
   New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean will deliver the convention's
keynote address Tuesday night, followed at the podium by former
President Ford.
   Wednesday night, the delegates will give their presidential
nomination to Bush, following a nominating speech by Sen. Phil
Gramm of Texas. Among the six seconding speakers are Penn State
football Coach Joseph Paterno, Rep. Robert Dornan of California and
Jeb Bush, the vice president's son.
   Also on the list are Republican activist Ninfa Lorenzo of
Houston, who says she plans to speak Spanish during her remarks,
Kansas City Councilwoman Joanne Collins and Federal Maritime
Commission Chairman Elaine Chao.
   On Thursday night, the delegates will pick a vice presidential
nominee and hear the acceptance speeches by Bush and his running
mate before adjourning.

   The dawn of peace in the 8-year-old
Iran-Iraq war is likely to be a sunset for the hopes of rebels in
each country, diplomats say.
   The cease-fire announced Monday may close crucial border
sanctuaries used by the Kurdish rebels fighting Iraq and the
leftist peoples' Mujahedeen seeking to topple Iran's Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini.
   That can only be bad news for Kurdish rebel leader Jalal
Talabani, who declared in an April interview with Middle East
magazine: ``We can no longer live with (Iraqi President) Saddam
Hussein in the same country ... now it's either him or us.''
   The cease-fire will take effect Aug. 20, and 350 U.N. observers
are to be in place along the 730-mile border within a week. That
gives both countries a chance to concentrate on eliminating their
rebels.
   ``I don't think the Iraqis are going to be anything other than
merciless'' toward the Kurdish rebels, said a Western diplomat in
Baghdad.
   Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, fighting for a Kurdish
republic, scored a series of military successes against Iraq late
last year in alliance with Iranian forces.
   But their fortunes faded as Iran's army appeared to crumble this
year, and diplomats say Iraq largely has squashed the Kurdish
forces.
   Witnesses said Iraq has tried to rob the rebels of base areas by
bulldozing dozens of villages in mountainous northern Iraq, where
about 2.5 million Kurds live.
   ``It's just one destroyed village after another,'' said a
diplomat who has toured the area.
   Kurds from different villages have been moved to newly built
towns of gray concrete houses _ breaking the tight social
solidarity of village life that rebels often used for protection.
   ``Kurds will continue to be Kurds ... but the village way of
life is a thing of the past,'' said the Western diplomat, who spoke
on condition of not being identified further.
   A 1975 Iraq-Iran treaty closed the border to rebels in each
country, helping quell Kurdish dissidence at that time. But Iran's
later support of Kurdish guerrilla action was one of the fuses that
led to full explosion of the war in September 1980.
   Iraq in the past also supported Kurdish dissidents inside Iran,
but its main aid during the war went to the Mujahedeen Khalq, which
moved to Iraq after its leaders were expelled from France in 1986.
   The Mujahedeen-led People's Liberation Army of Iran made a
series of raids into Iranian territory this year. The latest drove
60 miles into Iran and briefly captured two cities.
   Military observers said there is evidence that Iraqi forces
aided the Iranian rebel operations, an allegation Iraq and the
rebels denied.
   But a well-placed Iraqi source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said his government would almost surely block the border
to the Mujahedeen as part of any cease-fire.
   ``The Mujahedeen Khalq being based in Baghdad does have a lot to
do with the conflict,'' he noted.
   ``No doubt any peace settlement will mean the Mujahedeen Khalq
won't operate from Iraqi soil,'' said a European diplomat.
   Mujahedeen spokesman Ali Riza Jafer Zada refused to say whether
the organization would move its battle entirely within Iran. But he
insisted that closing the border would not stop the rebellion
against Khomeini.
   ``We have tremendous support inside Iran,'' he said. ``That
would be no problem.''

   Soviets are caught in a paper chase brought on by
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of openness. They can't get their
fill of glasnost-inspired writing for the same reason they can't
get enough toilet paper: a paper shortage.
   In a country where people read voraciously, the problem is more
than just another wrinkle in daily life.
   It means some people could miss vigorous debates in the
state-run press about the country's history and about Gorbachev's
wide-ranging social and economic reforms.
   Thousands have left post offices empty-handed after trying to
apply for their favorite newspaper and magazine subscriptions. They
have been waging a paper war against the problem, deluging
newspapers with letters of protest.
   ``It's understandable that we constantly have a paper deficit,
but in our time of revolutionary renewal, the thoughts and feelings
by which the country is living is concentrated in the newspapers
and magazines. Therefore, it wouldn't be awful to sacrifice the
circulation of other publications. Society would be generously
repaid,'' Muscovite N. Shulgin wrote in a letter published Aug. 6
in the cultural daily Sovietskaya Kultura.
   Since Gorbachev came to power in March 1985 and encouraged more
open discussion of the country's problems and history, citizens
have been snapping up periodicals like Ogonyok and Moscow News that
are at the forefront of the new openness, or glasnost.
   Such periodicals quickly sell out at newsstands, and
subscriptions are hard to come by.
   Last year, Soviets rejoiced when it was announced that
applications for 1989 subscriptions for the state-run press would
be accepted throughout 1988. In previous years, orders were taken
only after Aug. 1.
   But the jubilation was premature. The sad tale of would-be
subscribers has been unfolding the past two weeks in the Soviet
press.
   When Jan. 1 rolled around, Soviets were told they could only
sign up for newspapers and had to wait until August for magazine
subscriptions. But on July 20, the Ministry of Communications
issued what has now become an infamous order. Directive No. 315, in
effect, limited the number of 1989 subscriptions to their 1988
level.
   Further restrictions apply to 41 publications, including such
popular sellers as Ogonyok, Soviet Sport and Literaturnaya Gazeta.
   The sky's the limit, however, for the more conventional _ some
Soviets would say boring _ publications like Communist, Party Life
and Political Education.
   The problem extends to books. Authors complain that because of
the paper shortage, they have to wait years for their works to be
published.
   The government newspaper Izvestia complained Aug. 1 that Soviet
publishers waste limited paper and printing facilities producing
huge stacks of political tomes and brochures that few people want
to read.
   Faced with the public outcry over limits on subscriptions, the
Ministry of Communications has been put on the defensive.
   Two of its top officials have appeared _ in print _ explaining
the restrictions and complaining that they can't keep up with
demand. Gennady G. Kudryavtsev, first deputy minister of
communications, said in an interview with the Tass news agency
published Thursday that since 1985, when Gorbachev took power,
magazine and newspaper circulation has increased annually by 20
million copies. The average Soviet family receives seven
publications, he said.
   Kudryavtsev said the new restrictions became necessary only
because of the ``subscription boom'' and paper shortage. He said
paper production had dropped in part because mills are big
polluters, and the government is paying more attention to
preserving the environment under Gorbachev's leadership.
   He suggested people consider sharing, or as he put it,
``collective subscriptions.''

   A woman who was once America's lowest-paid
teacher is giving up a higher-paying job in Texas to reopen the
one-room schoolhouse where she taught for 16 years, and some
parents and children couldn't be happier.
   ``It keeps the community going. We don't want to be dying out
here,'' Peggy Sveum, whose two children will attend the grammar
school, said Thursday.
   Janice Herbranson, 54, took a job teaching toddlers in Progreso,
Texas, after the school closed in 1986. The school board decided it
was not practical to keep the building open for the rural
district's one remaining pupil.
   With five children through grade 6 living in the district now,
Ms. Herbranson _ the school's lone teacher for 16 years _ will be
back when classes begin anew Aug. 29.
   ``The whole community feels that something is back to life. It's
exciting for all of us,'' said Ms. Herbranson.
   Ms. Herbranson said she was happy teaching in Texas but that she
considers her home to be McLeod, a community of 45 people set in
wide-open cattle country. She maintains a home here and is part
owner of the Sand Dune Saloon.
   Mrs. Sveum said her daughters, first-grader Erin and
kindergartener Lisa, no longer will have to endure a 45-minute bus
ride to a school in Lisbon, about 25 miles away, and will benefit
from a one-on-one relationship with the teacher.
   ``They're very much looking forward to it,'' she said. ``They
went up while we were cleaning the school and they were playing
school themselves, writing on the chalkboard.''
   Five years ago at McLeod, Ms. Herbranson earned the dubious
distinction of being the lowest-paid teacher in the nation with a
$6,300 salary. The salary had increased to $6,800 when the school
closed, but her Texas job paid $25,000. Ms. Herbranson said she did
not know how much she would be paid here but that it will be a
substantial pay cut from her Texas job. Ilef Olerud, school board
president, said the board was still negotiating a contract.
   ``It doesn't cost me anything to live here in comparison to down
there (Texas),'' said Ms. Herbranson. ``It doesn't even out. But
it's not a drastic difference.''
   Ms. Herbranson said she believes the McLeod school has a bright
future. With several pre-school children in the district,
enrollment is expected to grow, she said.
   She said the reopening is a victory of sorts for rural one-room
schoolhouses. ``It's a good type of education, there's no doubt in
my mind,'' she said.

<HEAD>U.N. Chief Hopes For 1988 Independence Referendum In Western
Sahara</HEAD>

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
says he hopes an independence referendum can be held in the Western
Sahara this year and offered detailed proposals to end the
guerrilla war there.
   The U.N. chief urged Morocco and the Polisario pro-independence
movement to respond to his proposals by Sept. 1. Details of the
ideas were not released.
   Morocco has occupied the territory since the Spanish colonial
administration withdrew from what had been the Spanish Sahara
protectorate in 1975. Fighting with the Marxist-led Polisario
movement began soon after.
   Morocco and Mauritania jointly ran the Western Sahara until
Mauritania withdrew from the conflict in 1979. Morocco's battle
with Polisario has engaged most of its 100,000-man army and has
cost Morocco up to $2 million a day.
   Nearly 10,000 people have been killed in the war.
   Perez de Cuellar presented his proposals for organizing a
cease-fire and a referendum on Thursday to representatives of
Morocco and Polisario, and to the Organization of African Unity,
Algeria and Mauritania.
   He said details are being kept confidential, but added that the
``rather long document'' was the result of extensive discussions
among the parties, so ``they won't be extremely surprised'' by his
suggestions.
   ``The current chairman of the OAU and I have carried out a
number of consultations with the parties to the conflict in order
to find the means to bring about practical conditions which would
allow the people of the Western Sahara to freely exercise their
right to self-determination through a credible referendum, and
without military or administrative constraints,'' said the
secretary-general.
   Asked if the referendum will be held this year, Perez de Cuellar
replied: ``That is our hope.''
   Spain made little effort to develop the 110,000-square-mile
wilderness, about the size of Colorado. It is rich in phosphates
and possibly potash and iron ore but had a population of only about
75,000 when Spain pulled out.
   Polisario claims to have 16,000 heavily armed guerrillas
operating in the desert. Moroccan officers estimate guerrilla
strength at fewer than 4,000.

   The Swine Arena on the Ohio State
Fairgrounds became Pork Chop Downs as 15 pigs sauntered, sprinted
and stumbled toward the finish line _ a slop trough _ in the 10th
annual pig race.
   The winner was Turbo Pig, whose time of 3.9 seconds shaved more
than a second off the 2.7-second mark set last year by Squealing
Demon.
   Three hogs painted with orange, green and blue racing stripes
competed in the first of nine heats Thursday. It was a close race
until Joan Jett and Slop Buster collided halfway down the 50-foot
track.
   Seizing the opportunity, Alberto Clipper won it by a snout,
clocking in at 4.4 seconds.
   Other first-round winners were eventual champ Turbo Pig, Boaring
Down, Fried Bacon, New Deal Charlie, Burning Buns, Crisp Cutlet,
Calvin Swine and Bugsy.
   Second-round eliminations narrowed the field to Boaring Down,
New Deal Charlie, Burning Buns and Turbo Pig.
   As anticipation grew and verbal bets were placed, Turbo Pig
broke loose from the starting gate and headed for the feed trough.
Race action was stalled until five officials cornered the pig and
corralled him into the starting gate.
   With all four pigs in place, the starting bell sounded.
   Burning Buns took the early lead but squealed and slowed down as
Boaring Down darted in front of him. New Deal Charlie ran to the
outside and stopped for a fraction of a second to check out the
crowd. Turbo Pig took advantage of Charlie's curiosity, crossing
the finish line to claim first place.
   Amy Herbkersman of Collins, who won $234 for Turbo Pig's
performance, said she doesn't do anything special to prepare her
hog for race day.
   ``He's just a really fast pig,'' she said. ``I give him really
good feed, but I don't train him much.''

   It wasn't exactly breakfast at Tiffany's,
but more than 600 people turned out to dine on scrambled eggs,
sausages and hash-brown potatoes in the company of thousands of
diving bats.
   The occasion Thursday was the 28th annual Bat Flight Breakfast,
marking the return each summer day of Mexican freetail bats to
their nesting home inside Carlsbad Caverns at Carlsbad National
Park.
   The park annually attracts thousands of visitors who view the
stalactites and stalagmites that stretch through miles of caves
beneath the foothills of the Guadalupe Mountains of southeast New
Mexico. In the summertime, the visitors get a special treat.
   The bats exit the caverns at dusk to feed on insects. They
return the next day at dawn to rest and sleep, circling about 300
feet overhead before they dive in clusters into the cavern opening.
As night approaches, the cycle begins anew.
   As is usually the case, the breakfast event proved to be a
crowd-pleaser, with a record 635 people turning out, park officials
said.
   ``I drove over yesterday to watch them leave and decided to stay
over and watch them come in this morning,'' said Dr. Leon Blevins
of El Paso, Texas.

   Communist rebels ambushed a military
patrol on Negros island, wounding five soldiers, and damaged three
helicopters that were flying in reinforcements, the military said
today.
   The military's Visayas Command said New People's Army guerrillas
ambushed the patrol Thursday near Guihulngan, 350 miles southeast
of Manila.
   Six helicopters were dispatched from nearby Bacolod with
reinforcements but the rebels fired on the aircraft. Two of the
helicopters were forced to land at the scene but the third returned
to base with the wounded, the report said.
   There was no report of rebel casualties. The wounded include the
patrol leader, Lt. Juanito Bero, and the gunner of one of the
damaged helicopters, the report said. It did not say what happened
to the helicopters and helicopter crews that were forced to land at
the scene of the battle.
   A reporter for a Bacolod radio station, DYEZ, quoted soldiers as
saying one civilian militiaman was also wounded and seven others
were missing.
   Civilian militiamen often accompany soldiers on patrols in rebel
areas.
   The military said it could not confirm that any militiamen were
missing because reports were sketchy.
   The New People's Army, the armed wing of the Communist Party of
the Philippines, has been waging an insurgency to establish a
Marxist state for 19 years.

<HEAD>U.S. Team Caught Trying To Ship Prohibited Soviet Military
Materials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has lodged a formal
diplomatic protest about members of a U.S. Energy Department team
who attempted to ship sensitive materials from a nuclear test site
in the Soviet Union to the United States, The Washington Post
reported Thursday.
   The shipment, seized by Soviet authorities on July 17, involved
tools and wire associated with Soviet nuclear test preparations and
soil and rock samples which could be used in assessing yields of
nuclear blasts, the report said. The team members were not
identified.
   The project in question was part of the Joint Verification
Experiment concerning nuclear testing and ``has nothing to do with
on site inspection or the INF (intermediate-range nuclear force)
treaty,'' a Defense Department spokesman told The Associated Press.
   The story quoted Robert Barker, assistant to the Secretary of
Defense for Atomic Energy and chairman of the Military Liasion to
the Department of Energy, as saying the incident was ``absolutely
not'' a deliberate U.S. plan to collect prohibited materials.
   Contacted by telephone Thursday night, Barker initially denied
making the printed comments, saying ``that is absolutely wrong _ I
never said anything like that at all.''
   Asked if he had not spoken to the newspaper, the senior U.S.
official abruptly said ``no comment.''
   Questioned further about details in the report, Barker again
responded ``no comment _ good night.'' He refused to answer
questions involving the Soviet-U.S. experiment. The Post described
Baker as ``key participant in negotaitions leading to the U.S.
visit.''.
   The project was the first time the two nations had begun to
allow the other to observe and closely monitor their nuclear
blasts. The experiment is expected to lead to adoption of on-site
inspection measures to supplement traditional long-distance
surveillance by seismic and statellite sensors.
   The shipment in question was discovered when Soviet officials
searched a a crate of personal belongings of a U.S. official and
two employees of private companies under contract to the federal
government, the Post said.
   The agreement, which was drawn up in June, mandated tht none of
the hand tools, wire, soil samples, rocks and other materials
discoverd in the crate could be legally removed from the testing
area, the paper said.
   Baker and other unidentified U.S. officials were quoted in the
report as maintaining that the incident, which prompted the Soviet
protest to U.S. diplomats on July 25, was ``an honest
misunderstanding.''
   Although the Soviets demanded permanent expulsion of three team
members who had already left the country, the United States was
able to obtain permission for one of the employees, who was not
responsible for the attempt, to remain.
   The Post quoted unnamed senior U.S. officials as saying the
incident was not expected to halt the progress of the experiment,
which calls for observation of tests at the U.S. site in Nevada and
a special esperiment at the Soviet Semipalatinsk site.
   Officials at the Energy and State Departments Departments and
the Soviet Embassy declined comment on the incident, the report
said.

   Actress Eileen Brennan says anger helped her
recover from a car accident that nearly killed her shortly after
the success of the movie ``Private Benjamin,'' in which she starred
with Goldie Hawn.
   ``I was no saint,'' she says in September's Ladies Home Journal.
``I was angry, and anger is a powerful emotion. It increased my
determination not to go under, to get well.''
   The accident six years ago left her legs smashed, the bones on
the left side of her face broken, and her left eye socket
shattered. She said she fought her injuries with rage.
   However, her recovery left her addicted to the painkillers she
took. Two years after the accident, Brennan, 50, entered the Betty
Ford Center to cure her addiction to drugs.
   ``We get addicted to dull the pain of life,'' she says. ``But
once we accept that life is tough and painful, we can move on and
grow and evolve.''
   Although her television series ``Off the Rack'' was canceled in
1986 after only six episodes, Brennan appeared in the film ``Sticky
Fingers'' last spring, has plans for a new television series, ``Off
Duty,'' and stars in the current film ``The New Adventures of Pippi
Longstocking.''

   Preston Tucker, whose sleek, avant-garde
automobile dazzled a car-hungry nation in the late 1940s, was a
versatile salesman even if he did sometimes end up with a dog of a
purchase, says his daughter.
   In one scene in the new Francis Coppola-George Lucas movie
``Tucker: The Man and His Dream,'' he arrives home in a Packard
convertible with 12 Dalmatians he has taken in trade for a car
instead of money.
   According to his daughter, Mary Lee McAndrew, the incident
really happened.
   ``He actually did drive up in the Packard convertible, but he
had a truck following him,'' she recalled. ``He jumped out and
said, `Look what I've got for you!' And in the truck there were 24
circus-trained Dalmatians.''
   Changing the number of dogs simplified logistics, McAndrew said.
``Coppola couldn't find 24 circus-trained Dalmatians.''

   Vice President George Bush plans to seek
the endorsement of former boxing champion Muhammad Ali during the
Republican National Convention in New Orleans next week, says an
aide to Sen. Orrin Hatch.
   Bud Scruggs, Hatch's campaign manager, said the Utah Republican
and Ali became friends last year after Hatch helped a friend of Ali
obtain a Justice Department appointment. Hatch is the ranking
minority member of the Judiciary Committee, which reviews such
appointments.
   ``The senator, at first, didn't believe that Ali was really
calling him. The senator was a boxer as a youth, his son is a boxer
and (Hatch) has always been a fan of Ali,'' said Scruggs.
   Scruggs said Bush heard of Hatch's friendship and asked Hatch to
help him obtain Ali's endorsement for president.
   ``It's clear that Ali isn't partisan in his politics. He's
supporting some Democrats this election year. Bush will have to
close the sale himself,'' Scruggs said.

   Mayor Edward I. Koch's chef has announced he
will quit, a week after an investigation determined he was
improperly using the kitchen and staff at the official mayor's
residence for his private catering business.
   Mitchel London was told last week that he had to choose between
catering and his job cooking for Koch, which he has held since
1981. The mayor's office released a statement Thursday saying
London would be leaving as Gracie Mansion chef by Nov. 3.
   ``While I regret his decision, I understand it and very much
appreciate his seven years of service to the city,'' Koch said.
   The city Department of Investigation found recently that London
had violated the City Charter by preparing food at Gracie Mansion
for his catering business.

   India has conferred its most prestigious
prize, the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding,
on U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, government-owned
television said.
   The $107,000 award, named after India's first prime minister, is
given annually to ``an eminent citizen of the world who contributes
to peace and better understanding among nations.''
   ``It is a great honor,'' Perez de Cuellar said, according to a
report on government television Thursday. He is expected to travel
to India in November to accept the award, the news broadcast said.
   Perez de Cuellar was chosen for the award by a seven-member jury
headed by S.D. Sharma, India's vice president, for his role in
ending the 8-year Gulf war and for his efforts on behalf of world
peace, the broadcast said.
   The Nehru Award has been given to 23 people from various fields
of activity since 1965.

   Comedian-candidate Pat Paulsen kicked off his

bombshell: he's becoming a Republican.
   ``I'm going to New Orleans _ I have to, because the Democrats
tossed me right out of Atlanta,'' Paulsen said Thursday after
declaring his candidacy. ``They're not very friendly people.''
   Paulsen, who made his first run for the White House 20 years

the Statue of Liberty in the background.
   The former regular on the ``Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour''
didn't have too much good to say about his opponents, Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis and Vice President George Bush.
   ``I call 'em Tweedle Dumb and Tweedle Dumber _ you decide who
goes first,'' Paulsen said. ``But hey, I give 'em both credit _ I
mean, to get this far without getting caught is pretty good.''

   Most doctors are not using clot-dissolving drugs

   ``Our object is to get the results of this treatment widely

aspirin and a clot-dissolving drug within 24 hours of the onset of
a heart attack can reduce the death rate over the following five
weeks from 13 percent to 8 percent.
   This should now be considered standard treatment, the doctors
said. But ``at the moment, most patients in the United States don't
have blood-clot dissolving treatment of any type,'' said Richard
Peto, one of the researchers.
   ``I've never seen a trial that produced results as striking as
these ones,'' he said.
   Peto said the treatment could save the lives of 25,000 of the
500,000 Americans who have heart attacks each year if they all
received it.
   It costs about $150 and can be done at any community hospital or
even by a doctor outside a hospital, the researchers said.
   Peto and other study participants spoke at a press conference
held in London and New York in conjunction with publication of the
latest findings in the forthcoming issue of The Lancet, a British
medical journal. The results were widely publicized in March at a
meeting of the American College of Cardiology in Atlanta.
   The researchers studied 17,187 patients at 417 hospitals around
the world. Some patients were given aspirin, and some the
clot-dissolving drug streptokinase. Another group was given both,
and a control group was given neither.
   The death rate up to five weeks after a heart attack was 13
percent in the untreated control group. It dropped to about 10{
percent in the patients given either aspirin or streptokinase, and
it dropped to 8 percent in patients given both drugs, Peto said.
   Furthermore, the study showed that the drugs reduced deaths in
elderly patients, who were previously not thought suitable for
clot-dissolving treatment because doctors thought it might increase
their risk of strokes, Peto said.
   It also showed that the drugs were helpful even if given as late
as 24 hours after the onset of chest pains, Peto said.
   Streptokinase is derived from streptococcus bacteria, which
cause strep throat. Most heart attacks are caused by a clot
blocking the coronary arteries, which provide a nourishing blood
supply to the heart muscle.
   Streptokinase dissolves the clots and aspirin helps to prevent
the clotting of blood cells called platelets, thus helping to
prevent reformation of clots, the researchers said.
   The researchers found no increase in the rate of strokes
following the treatment. Streptokinase caused potentially hazardous
low blood pressure in 8 out of 100 patients, but ``this can be
easily dealt with provided doctors and nurses are aware that it can
occur,'' said Dr. Rory Collins, another study participant.
   The study, called the second International Study of Infarct
Survival, or ISIS, will be followed by a third ISIS study intended
to compare the effectiveness of streptokinase with other
clot-dissolving drugs.
   The most widely publicized of the alternative drugs is tissue
plasminogen activator, or TPA, which is produced by genetic
engineering and costs some $2,000 per treatment, compared to the
$150 cost of streptokinase.
   Current data does not allow a direct comparison of the
effectiveness of the two drugs, the researchers said.
   Peter Drake, a biochemist and securities analyst with Vector
Securities International in Deerfield, Ill., said that the dramatic
success of streptokinase would likely force down the price of TPA.

   Republican lawmakers say they expect President
Reagan to sign legislation that rushes $672 million to the Veterans
Administration, the federal prison system and an assortment of
other programs said to need the money.
   The House approved the supplemental spending bill by a 270-32
tally late Thursday, then sent the measure to the Senate, where it
passed on a voice vote and was sent to the White House.
   Lawmakers prided themselves on fighting off temptation and
refraining from the frequent practice of attaching pet projects to
the measure, saying they abided by a pact congressional leaders
reached with Reagan last fall. The legislation was labeled a ``dire
emergency'' bill because the measure was supposed to be limited to
that type of spending.
   House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said it was ``a
very stringently conceived bill that is absolutely required for the
continuation of many essential services.''
   The $672 million bill was a compromise between a $189 million
measure approved by the House on July 27 and a $633 million version
passed by the Senate on Wednesday. The bill is for the 1988 fiscal
year, which ends Sept. 30. In addition to the fresh money, the bill
would allow $200 million to be transferred among the budgets of
various agencies.
   Eyeing a nearly month-long recess that began at the close of the
day's business, conference committee members worked out the
compromise and rushed the bill through final approval in both
houses in a single day.
   The few objections in the House came from legislators who
complained this measure was no different from other spending bills.
   ``This is no emergency,'' said Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn.
   As often happens with spending bills in Congress, the deal was
reached by each chamber agreeing to most of what the other had
proposed, rather than mutually chopping away at each other's
sought-after projects.
   Thus, the House accepted Senate provisions that would give the
Veterans Administration $530 million in new spending to help pay
for an increase in some benefits, a burgeoning caseload and medical
care.
   The Senate also had sought $23 million to help the FBI keep an
eye on Soviet inspectors monitoring American compliance with the
new nuclear arms treaty. The final bill contained $14 million of
that amount.
   The Senate consented to spending $15 million for state
unemployment programs _ the House had wanted $50 million _ and $24
million the House wanted so the government can process refugees
from the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and elsewhere.
   In addition, the measure bore $75 million for the Department of
Justice, mostly for expenses arising from last year's rioting by
Cuban detainees in prisons in Atlanta and Oakdale, La.
   It also had $60 million to help the Coast Guard keep its patrols
going; $55 million for the Agriculture Department to pay for some
drought costs; $49 million for benefits to people who lose their
jobs because of foreign competition, and $43 million for payments
to people with black lung disease.

   The world's second-largest convenience
store chain says it will postpone a plan to deny medical benefits
to employees with ailments related to drugs, alcohol or AIDS
because of a ``general misunderstanding'' of the policy.
   Adopted in January by Circle K stores, the policy met with a
storm of protest when it was publicly disclosed last week.
   The company said it would no longer pay for employees' medical
care for illnesses resulting from ``personal lifestyle decisions,''
including the use of alcohol or drugs, self-inflicted injury, or
infection with acquired immune deficiency syndrome through any
means other than blood transfusions.
   The policy applied to about 3,000 Circle K employees hired since
Jan. 1. The company said no employee has been denied coverage so
far as a result of it. Since the company is self-insured, its
health care plan is not covered by state regulations banning such
restrictions. Most health insurance policies exclude coverage for
suicide attempts but cover claims related to AIDS and substance
abuse.
   The Phoenix-based company has about 26,000 employees at more
than 4,000 stores in 27 states. It also has about 800 other stores
in Japan, the United Kingdom, Canada, Indonesia and Hong Kong. It
had sales of about $2 billion last year.
   Karl Eller, Circle K Corps.'s chairman and chief executive
officer, announced Thursday that the plan's implementation would be
delayed while it was reviewed by company officials.
   ``A general misunderstanding of the policy has arisen and that
needs to be clarified,'' Eller said. ``We were and still are
extremely concerned about containing costs of medical insurance for
employees.''
   Ed Buck, a Phoenix gay-rights activist, met with company
officials Wednesday in an attempt to negotiate a change in the
policy. He called the announcement ``an excellent, excellent
signal.''
   Buck said he and Circle K officials agreed on four points:
   _There are ambiguities in the corporation's health-benefits
policy.
   _The intention of the policy, which is to cut the cost of health
insurance, ``is legitimate and well-meaning.''
   _The policy is open to review and possible revision.
   _The company and the gay-rights activists will meet again Monday.
   Ray Cox, a Circle K senior vice president, said the company
agreed that clarification of the policy was needed but noted the
agreement was to review the policy, not cancel it.
   ``I don't feel we're conceding anything at this point,'' he said.
   Buck, who gained prominence by directing the 1987 campaign to
recall then-Gov. Evan Mecham, said the primary problem with the
policy was that the company became the judge of its employees'
lifestyles.
   ``That creates two problems,'' Buck said. ``One is that the
employee doesn't know whether he is covered in any given instance.
The second is that it creates an administrative nightmare for the
company in deciding on a case-by-case basis what claims it will pay
for.''
   Buck said some gay activists favored picketing and boycotts of
Circle K stores, but he counseled against it.
   ``I think that they (Circle K) are willing and anxious to open
good-faith negotiations,'' Buck said.
   ``I told them that this is an emotional issue and they (the gay
community) are reacting emotionally,'' he said. ``I told the other
side that they must recognize the company's goal of
cost-containment is legitimate, but the policy became confused,
muddled and misdirected.''

<HEAD>Lawmaker Says Waldheim Named Allied Prisoner Saboteur, Who Was
Then Executed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A member of Parliament says Austrian President
Kurt Waldheim, while an officer in the German army during World War
II, caused the execution of a British prisoner who led an Allied
escape attempt.
   Robert Rhodes James, a Conservative Party member, said Thursday
that Waldheim should be tried on war crimes charges.
   The House of Commons member told The Associated Press by
telephone that he based his accusations on a British historian's
claims that Waldheim signed a Germany army intelligence report
labeling British army Capt. David Warren a saboteur.
   The action constituted a virtual death sentence for Warren,
because Nazi leader Adolf Hitler issued a standing order to execute
Allied commandos linked to sabotage, said Rhode James.
   ``We're talking about murder _ cold-blooded murder of a prisoner
of war, and that is a war crime,'' Rhodes James said. ``It didn't
happen in the heat of battle. It was a cold-blooded criminal act.''
   Rhodes James headed Waldheim's private office from 1973-76 when
Waldheim, elected president two years ago, served as U.N.
secretary-general in New York.
   Waldheim has denied any role in executing Allied prisoners when
he served as an intelligence lieutenant for Gen. Alexander Lohr's
Army Group E, which committed many atrocities in the Balkans.
   Rhodes James said Waldheim, 69, should be prosecuted.
   ``I wouldn't particularly worry about a lower-ranking person,
but Waldheim was a former secretary-general to the U.N. and is now
head of state in Austria,'' Rhodes James said.
   In March 1986, it was revealed that Waldheim was a German army
lieutenant in the Balkans from 1942 to 1945 after Hitler's troops
took control of Austria.
   The World Jewish Congress has accused Waldheim of massacres of
Yugoslav and Greek civilians and partisans, as well as deportation
of Greek Jews to Nazi death camps. He was also accused of
involvement in a slaughter of about 70,000 people at the Yugoslav
town of Kozarra in 1942.
   Waldheim has denied these accusations.
   Even so, the debate over his war past has badly marred relations
between Austria and Israel and frayed Austria's ties with the
United States and Britain as well. The U.S. Justice Department in
1987 placed Waldheim on its list of aliens prohibited from entering
the United States.
   The Australian-born Warren belonged to the clandestine Special
Operations Executive but wore his regular army uniform while
leading an escape attempt of Allied prisoners of war across Greece,
Rhodes James said.
   The uniform entitled the captured officer to be treated as an
ordinary POW, Rhodes James said. But he charged that Waldheim
interrogated the prisoner and signed the report declaring him a
saboteur. A firing squad executed Warren on May 15, 1944.
   Rhodes James said his charges stem from conversations with
Christopher Montague Woodhouse, a historian and former member of
Parliament who ran Allied operations in Greece from 1943 to 1945.
   Woodhouse's report on Warren is to be published later this month
in Encounter magazine. Meanwhile, Woodhouse has refused to talk to
the press.
   Rhodes James said he has not read the report but discussed its
contents with Woodhouse, 71, now a professor of Greek studies at
King's College, London.

   Nicaragua's largest opposition
organization called for a demonstration Sept. 4 to demand a
``national salvation government'' and protest a recent crackdown by
the leftist government.
   Ramiro Gurdian, vice president of the Nicaraguan Democratic
Coordinate, said Thursday the demonstration will take place in
Managua's downtown Plaza of the Revolution. The Coordinate groups
opposition labor and business organizations and political parties.
   There was no immediate comment from the Sandinista government,
but there is little chance it will grant the necessary permit. The
government rejected two opposition requests to stage demonstrations
in the past month.
   Police violently broke up the last Coordinate demonstration held
July 10 in Nandaimes, about 40 miles south of the capital. Dozens
of people were injured and more than 40 opposition figures detained
during the protest, which had been authorized by the government.
   The Sandinistas closed down Radio Catolica, the Roman Catholic
radio station, and slapped a 15-day suspension against the
opposition newspaper La Prensa for their coverage of the incident.
   The Sandinistas also expelled U.S. Ambassador Richard Melton and
seven other U.S. diplomats from Nicaragua, saying Melton
collaborated with the domestic opposition to destabilize the
government.

   Despite greater awareness of exercise and healthy
foods, many Americans remain ``significantly overweight,''
according to federal researchers who say most government
nutritional goals are unlikely to be met.
   ``Everybody knows what is required to lose weight, yet the
prevalence of overweight doesn't seem to change much,'' said Dr.
Marion Nestle of the U.S. Office of Disease Prevention and Health
Promotion in Washington.
   The national Centers for Disease Control, in its weekly report
Thursday, reviewed the progress toward the government's 15
top-priority goals for American nutrition in 1990, including
raising public knowledge of the effects of salt and lowering
average blood-cholesterol levels.
   ``Substantial progress'' has been made in several areas, and
three of the goals will be fully met, researchers said.
   But despite the progress, Americans will probably fall short of
eight major goals, including that of getting people to lose weight,
said Ms. Nestle, whose office helped prepare the report.
   ``The research that relates (poor) diet to disease is now
incontrovertible,'' she said. ``It's really time now to start
looking at ways to implement the recommendations that everybody is
familiar with _ ways to improve the nutritional status of the
population.''
   The goals that will likely not be met, she said, are:
   _ Having less than 10 percent of American men and 17 percent of
American women over the ``significantly overweight'' level, defined
as more than 20 percent over desired weight.
   ``There's just been little change on that through the years,''
Ms. Nestle said. ``It's still about one-fourth of the country.''
   _ Having 50 percent of the overweight population on a
weight-loss program combining diet and exercise. The CDC said
recent surveys show half the nation's overweight people are indeed
trying to lose weight _ but only half are using both diet and
exercise.
   _ Cutting the average adult level of harmful serum cholesterol
below the 200 count. In a 1976-80 survey, average cholesterol
levels were 211 for women and 215 for men, down from 214 and 217 in
1971-74. ``That rate of decline is not as fast as it should be,''
Ms. Nestle said.
   _ Having at least three-fourths of all mothers breast-feeding
their babies at the time they leave the hospital. A 1984 survey put
the figure at 61 percent, up from 45 percent in 1978.
   _ Having all packaged foods labeled with ``useful calorie and
nutrient information.'' Such is the case in 55 percent of packaged
foods, up from 42 percent in 1978, Ms. Nestle said.
   _ Including nutrition counseling in ``virtually all routine
health contacts with health professionals.'' A 1985 survey showed
the figure at less than 30 percent, the CDC noted.
   _ Elimination of cases where a child's growth is retarded
because of nutritional deficiencies. Although the problem cannot be
precisely measured, it persists, Ms. Nestle said.
   _ Including nutrition education in the required school
curriculum in all states. By 1985, only 12 states had such a
requirement, the CDC said.
   The three objectives that researchers think will be fully met,
she said, are:
   _ Having more than 75 percent of the population aware of
nutritional risks for conditions such as heart disease and high
blood pressure (fats and salt) and tooth decay (between-meal
sweets). Awareness already runs as high as 90 percent in some
categories, the CDC report said.
   _ Having 90 percent of U.S. adults aware that to lose weight
they must eat fewer calories or increase physical activity, or
both. The percentage was 73 in 1985 and is rising quickly, Ms.
Nestle said.
   _ Implementation of a comprehensive national nutrition status
monitoring system. It is already in place, the CDC reported.

   Two congressman, saying they want to restore

violations in the House of Representatives.
   Reps. Joseph DioGuardi, R-N.Y., and Barney Frank, D-Mass., also

audit financial matters of the House and its members.
   ``What we're trying to deal with here is the perception that

   He said the public ranks congressmen ``just below snake oil
salesmen'' when it comes to ethics.
   Both congressmen stressed the conflicts inherent in the current
system, nder which House members police themselves through the
Committee on Standards of Official Conduct. That panel, composed of
an equal number of Republicans and Democrats, enforces the code of
conduct and recommends to the full House sanctions against members

   Americans spent $4.3 billion on air
conditioning in July, which the government says is more than a
quarter-billion dollars more than usual for the month.
   The hot month, which brought high temperatures and little rain
to much of the nation, added some $255 million more to the national
air conditioning bill than would be expected in a normal July, the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported Thursday.
   That averaged out to a July air conditioning bill of $104 for
the typical home, $6 more than normal.
   Only the west south central states _ Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas
and Oklahoma spent less on cooling than in a typical July. The
highest increase were in the East North Central region _ including
the Great Lakes States _ which showed an average bill $16 more than

<HEAD>Cardenas Asks Criminal Charges Against Election Officials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who
lost his bid to become Mexico's president, accused two election
officials of manipulating vote results and asked the government to
file charges against them.
   Cardenas claims he won the July 6 vote, but results released by
the Federal Electoral Commission gave Cardenas, of the leftist
National Democratic Front coalition, 31.12 percent of the vote.
   Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the candidate of the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party, received 50.36 percent, the
commission said.
   The Chamber of Deputies, sitting as the electoral college, meets
Aug. 15-31 to review the results and formally declare a winner in
the July 6 election.
   On Thursday, Cardenas asked the Federal Attorney General's
office to file criminal charges against commission president Manuel
Bartlett Diaz and technical secretary Fernando Elias Calles for
``hiding information on the electoral results'' from nearly half of
the nation's approximately 55,000 voting stations.
   Bartlett also is Interior Minister.
   The petition said the Election Commission's failure to release a
breakdown of results from 24,642 polling places within four days of
the election was a ``flagrant violation'' of the federal electoral
code.
   A statement issued by the Front said the commission's failure to
release the results made it impossible for opposition candidates to
log formal complaints of voting irregularities in those local
districts.
   The attorney general first must find cause for opening an
investigation to determine whether criminal charges are warranted,
said Cecilia Corona, a spokeswoman with the Social Democratic
Party, which belongs to the Front.
   On Aug. 4, Cardenas, Manuel Clouthier of the National Action
Party and Rosario Ibarra de Piedra of the Revolutionary Workers
Party renewed their charges of widespread fraud and called for new
elections if their demands to clarify results were not met.
   Clouthier, the National Action candidate, has said the elections
were so tainted by fraud it is difficult to determine who won.
   Clouthier received 17.07 percent of the vote, according to
official results.
   Both Cardenas and Clouthier have announced protests for Sunday
evening, the night before the electoral college goes into session.
   Meanwhile, the ruling party announced Thursday night it will
hold a series of nationwide rallies on Friday to defend Salinas'
victory as part of a ``Popular Day of National Victory.''
   The rallies of party supporters are being held ``to recognize
the validity of the vote and the defense of the same,'' a party
statement said.
   It also announced a series of demonstrations of workers,
students, professionals and other party sectors leading up to Sept.
1, when Salinas is expected to be declared the official
president-elect.

   Israel's military chief of staff says his
troops have already held drills to prepare for possible warfare
with Arab armies after the Iran-Iraq war ends.
   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, the chief of staff, said on Israel
television Thursday his troops ``completed a maneuver based on the
presumption that the war had ended and (Iraqi) forces are free. We
also took Syria into account.''
   Iraq has sent ground forces to fight Israel in three of the five
wars the Jewish state has fought since 1948.
   Shomron said his troops held the maneuvers two weeks before
Iran's July 18 announcement that it was ready to accept a
cease-fire with Iraq.
   ``This was because of an assessment of the situation,'' Shomron
said Wednesday night. ``We knew this war was winding down.''
   The U.N.-mediated cease-fire, announced Monday, is to take
effect Aug. 20.
   Israel has monitored the war carefully, believing the outcome
has an important bearing on Israel's security and the future of the
Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Military and intelligence officers said Israel was safer while
Iran and Iraq were fighting each other, but they worried about
Israel becoming an eventual target for Iraqi forces that were
better trained as a result of the war.
   While it will take Iraq some time to recover from its losses
after the 8-year-old conflict, ``in the longer run, this will mean
a bigger danger for Israel,'' reserve duty Brig. Gen. Aharon
Levran, a former intelligence officer, told foreign reporters at a
government-sponsored briefing.
   ``The gulf war appears to be ending, and I don't add `Thank God'
... Israel will have to think about it and start preparing,'' said
Levran, an analyst at Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for
Strategic Studies.
   Levran said any future war between Israel and Syria ``will be
much more costly, more bloody, than it has been in the past''
because Damascus has significantly improved the quantity and
quality of its military equipment.
   He noted Syria recently had developed chemical warheads for its
surface-to-surface missiles.
   Also, Syria had doubled its number of ground forces from five to
10 divisions and increased the number of tanks from 1,700 to 4,000
since the 1973 Golan Heights war, he said.
   Damascus also has obtained advanced weaponry from the Soviet
Union and more than doubled the number of attack aircraft in its
arsenal, Levran said. He refused to give a figure.
   On the other hand, he said Syria's military expenditures had
forced it to cut back on the size and training of its ground forces.

<DATELINE>HADDONFIELD, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple whose intentional
disappearance froma college campus touched off a four-month
nationwide search say they're tired of media attention and just
want to resume their lives.
   ``We just to want to let it lay,'' said Scott Swanson, 23, in an
interview published Thursday in The Philadelphia Inquirer. ``We
just want to get back to our normal lives.''
   Swanson and his new wife, Carolyn McLean, 22, of Haddonfield,
fled the campus of Wheaton College in Illinois in April.
   The couple has received scores of hate letters from people who
view them as spoiled rich kids who allowed police to spend
thousands of dollars searching for them. The pair surfaced July 26
in San Diego.
   ``I don't think people will ever understand why we did it,''
Swanson told the newspaper. ``We're tired of going public with it.''
   After a week-long visit in New Jersey, the couple will settle in
his hometown of Elgin, Ill., Swanson said. He will take a job with
a lawn care company and finish his psychology degree at Northern
Illinois University.
   His wife does not plan to return to college immediately, he
said. She hopes to get a job at a bank and write in her spare time.
   Swanson said it is unlikely that the couple will return to
Wheaton, a rigorous evangelical Christian college.
   ``It's not that I would feel uncomfortable, but I think everyone
else would feel uncomfortable,'' he said. ``And I don't think
Wheaton could handle any more media attention.''

   A strong earthquake rocked the Tokyo area today,
halting many subways and rail lines and bringing elevators to a
stop. There were no immediate reports of serious damage or
injuries, police said.
   Office workers in Tokyo scrambled under desks during the quake,
and trains on all three of the region's high-speed ``bullet'' train
lines and many other rail lines were stopped while workers checked
tracks for damage, officials said.
   The earthquake struck at about 2:15 p.m. and registered 5.3 on
the Richter scale, Central Meteorological Agency officials said.
   The quake was centered in southern Chiba prefecture, about 40
miles southeast of Tokyo, the agency said.
   The Japan Broadcasting Corp. said residents of Tateyama, near
the epicenter, ran from buildings when the rumbling began.
Elevators in many buildings stopped automatically at the closest
floor and opened their doors, as they are designed to do during
earthquakes.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause
slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable
damage, 6 severe damage.

<HEAD>Delegate Recalls President Proposing Marriage For Him</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Almost two years after the fact, the story is
out that President Reagan proposed to a Louisiana state senator's
wife for him.
   ``I didn't think there was a chance he would do it,'' said Sen.
Fritz Windhorst, a member of the Louisiana delegation to the
Republican National Convention.
   ``It was obviously a once-in-a-lifetime experience from more
than one point of view,'' said Barbara Turner, who became Mrs.
Windhorst thanks in part to a gentle shove from the president.
   Turner said she and Windhorst, who had been dating for about 18
months, attended a luncheon in September 1986 for Henson Moore, a
Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate.
   In a line of well-wishers meeting Reagan, Windhorst asked the
president for the unique favor. ``He said, `I'll do it. I never get
to do good things like this,''' Windhorst recalled.
   Reagan, said Turner, ``walked up to me, took both of my hands
and smiled at me broadly (and said) `It's been a long time since I
proposed to anyone,' which took me aback.''
   Turner said she was left speechless and ``looking devoid of any
intelligence whatsoever. He said, `I think you should marry the
senator.''
   She said she remained silent before the president said, ``Honey,
say something. Say yes.'' Turner said she finally ``gasped a yes
out'' and ``kind of wobbled off at that point.''
   Reagan wrote the couple a congratulatory note after they were
married Nov. 22, 1986, Windhorst said.

   The Kansas delegation to the Republican
National Convention is actively pushing to have favorite son Bob
Dole named as the party's vice presidential nominee.
   Gov. Mike Hayden, the delegation's chairman, said Thursday he
and other state GOP officials have met with Vice President George
Bush's campaign to discuss the possible selection of Dole, the
Senate minority leader, as Bush's running mate.
   Dole asked state party officials Wednesday not to put his name
in nomination for the slot, a move some Kansans interpret as a sign
Dole is a top candidate to be the vice presidential nominee.
   ``In order for George Bush to win, he must be strong in the
Midwest,'' Hayden told reporters at a news conference. ``George
Bush needs a boost, and Bob Dole is the one to do it in the
heartland.''
   Bush aides leaked polling results Thursday conducted for the
campaign that showed Dole helping Bush more than other running
mates, but not by a margin the campaign aides consider significant.

   Vice President George Bush has done little
to further civil rights and has supported policies that have
weakened the national defense, says former Democratic presidential
candidate Jesse Jackson.
   ``George Bush is weak on defense,'' Jackson said Thursday night
to delegates to a national convocation of the Christian Church
(Disciples of Christ).
   ``We've got more money spent, more weapons used, fewer
friends,'' he said.
   Jackson said misguided foreign policies of the Reagan
administration have undermined the United States' interests in
Central America and the Middle East.
   He also accused Bush of not speaking out in support of civil
rights.
   ``Back in '81, Reagan threatened not to extend the Voting Rights
Act, the most basic right in a democracy. Bush was silent,'' he
said. ``In 1988, Reagan vetoed the Civil Rights Restoration Act.
Bush was silent.''

   The U.S. dollar opened lower and then moved up
slightly against the Japanese yen in Tokyo on Friday, while stock
prices moved higher.
   The U.S. currency finished the week's trading at 133.05 yen,
down 1.02 yen from Thursday's close. After opening at 132.85 yen,
it recovered moderately, fluctuating during the day between 132.77
yen and 133.30 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average,
which gained 230.11 points Thursday, added an additional 48.53
points or 0.17 percent Friday, finishing the day at 27,833.51.
   Traders said the dollar moved higher after Finance Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa told reporters Friday morning that exchange rates
should be left to market forces.
   They said the market reacted favorably to Miyazawa's comment,
taken as an indication that Japanese monetary authorities are not
planning to intervene or raise interest rates in an attempt to curb
the dollar's rise.
   In mid-week trading Wednesday, the dollar had risen as high as
the 135-yen level for the first time in three weeks.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average,
a 230.11-point winner on Thursday, gained 65.84 points to close the
morning session at 27,850.82.
   The Nikkei index, the market's main barometer, was up more than
149 points just after the opening but pulled back later in reaction
to concern over U.S. trade figures slated to be released next
Tuesday in Washington.

   A carpenter apparently angry over
being denied payment for a construction job used a chainsaw to hack
away at a partially completed building, police said.
   Officers said Ronald W. Fry, 36, caused an estimated $15,000 in
damage to the future site of an extension of a shopping center
Wednesday. He was arrested for investigation of malicious mischief.
   The construction superintendent called police when Fry became
upset after construction officials turned down his request to be
paid in full for $1,200 worth of carpentry work that was
three-quarters completed, police said.
   Fry allegedly cut down poles and damaged one of the building's
walls and some of the electrical conduits, said Michael Hekmat, an
owner of the project.
   Fry was being held at Ventura County jail on $6,000 bail. He
also faces several outstanding warrants, including a probation
violation, jail authorities said.

<TEXT>
   The Senate, reacting to the Pentagon bribery
investigation, placed new restrictions on defense consultants as it
approved a $282 billion military budget bill designed to win
President Reagan's approval.
   If the proposal becomes law, consultants will be required, for
the first time, to spell out who hires them and whether they have
potential conflicts of interests.
   ``The sad fact is that there is nothing requiring consultants
under contract to the Pentagon to disclose conflicts of interest,''
said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., one of the co-sponsors of the
proposal approved Thursday.
   The amendment was adopted on a voice vote shortly before the
Senate approved the $282 billion bill on a 90-4 vote.
   Levin's proposal arose in the wake of the Pentagon bribery case,
which involves allegations that private consultants, many of them
former Pentagon employes, paid current Defense Department employees
for inside details about future contracts. No charges have yet been
filed.
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., a co-sponsor of the proposal, said the
registration is needed because ``we need some mechanism for finding
out who these people are working for and whether they're working
both sides of the street.''
   Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., agreed, saying, ``This is an
increasingly large problem.''
   The Senate also added an amendment intended to send a message to
U.S. allies in Japan and Western Europe that they should do more to
pay for allied defense.
   The votes came shortly before the Senate passed the bill and
followed by one week Reagan's veto of the first congressional
attempt to pass a Pentagon budget.
   Reagan vetoed that bill because he didn't like its restrictions
on arms control policy or its deep cuts into his proposal for Star
Wars spending. The measure passed Thursday includes the Star Wars
reductions, but none of the arms control limitations.
   Reagan rejected the bill authorizing the Pentagon budget, which
is the first half of the congressional budget process. A second
measure is needed to appropriate money for the authorized projects,
and Thursday's bill was the appropriation measure.
   When Congress returns after Labor Day from its recess, a
House-Senate conference committee will meet to resolve differences
between the measures approved by each chamber.
   The House approved its defense appropriation bill two months ago
and it doesn't contain either of the amendments approved Thursday
by the Senate. Although both chambers are controlled by Democrats,
Reagan's military budget generally fared better in the House than
the Senate.
   The Senate's ``burden-sharing'' amendment orders a major review
of U.S. overseas commitments, limits the deployment of American
troops to Japan and South Korea, and sets a limit on spending for
U.S. military personnel stationed overseas. The last provision
requires the allies to pay the difference if deployment costs of
U.S. troops rise above 1988 levels.
   The Senate rejected, 59-36, another provision which proposed a
10 percent reduction in the number of U.S. military dependents
living overseas.
   In the past year, both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill
have complained that U.S. allies should pay more for allied
defenses. Japan, in particular, has been a prime target of such
criticism.
   Voting against the spending bill were Sens. Kent Conrad, D-N.D.;
Mark Hatfield, R-Ore.; Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.; and William
Proxmire, D-Wis. Not voting were Sens. Joseph Biden, D-Del.; Thad
Cochran, R-Miss.; Bob Kasten, R-Wis.; Larry Pressler, R-S.D.;
Lowell Weicker, R-Conn.; and James Exon, D-Neb.

<HEAD>Palestinian Shot In Attack On Israeli Patrol</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers opened fire today on three
Palestinians who attacked them with chains, clubs and an ax in a
pre-dawn fight, the army said. One Palestinian was killed and
another was wounded in the leg.
   The clash took place shortly after midnight at the Mughazi
refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, said an army spokesman who was not
identified in keeping with military regulations.
   Israel radio identified the dead man as Riad Suleiman Abu
Mandil, 23. Army officials said he had participated in anti-Israeli
demonstrations and attacks on soldiers in the past.
   Israeli sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the man
ran from the army patrol after being wounded and may have bled to
death. An autopsy was being conducted to determine the cause of
death.
   The third member of the Palestinian group was arrested, said the
sources. They suggested the group may have been painting slogans on
walls and were surprised by the Israeli squad.
   The death brought to 240 the number of Palestinians killed since
the uprising began Dec. 8. Four Israelis have died.
   Meanwhile, the leaders of Israel's two major political parties
intensified debate on the future of the West Bank and Gaza Strip
following Jordanian King Hussein's decision to cut ties with the
occupied lands.
   In an interview with armed forces radio, Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres said Israel must decide in Nov. 1 elections to pursue peace
before arguing over who Israel's negotiating partner will be in
peace talks.
   ``What does Israel want _ to take a peace initiative or to sit
idly and let the Arabs and the Russians and the whole world run our
affairs? If we do not take the initiative, and that's actually what
the Likud bloc proposes, others will take it,'' warned Peres, the
head of the liberal Labor Party.
   Peres indicated he still believed that Jordan had to be a
negotiating partner even though Hussein has declared he would not
bargain on behalf of the Palestinians.
   ``We have always thought we should conduct negotiations both
with Jordan and the Palestinians, as Jordan is responsible for the
main border and the Palestinians are those who bear the main burden
of the Palestinian problem.
   ``We can't run away from facts ... What does Jordan want, war or
peace, that is the question?'' said Peres.
   In an interview with the Jerusalem Post daily, Likud's industry
minister, Ariel Sharon, argued the ``only realistic policy'' was to
consider Jordan a Palestinian state since most of its 3.5 million
people are Palestinian.
   ``The only thing to which we have to object in the strongest
possible way is attempts to foist on us a second Palestinian state
to our east,'' said Sharon.
   Sharon, who has a wide following among Israel's hardliners,
proposed that Israel annex portions of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. He said there was a consensus that much of the territory was
needed for security reasons.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, leader of Likud, earlier this
week ruled out annexation.
   Shamir said in a speech to the National Defense College that the
status of the territories could be decided only in talks with
Palestinians not affiliated with the PLO, which Israel regards as a
terrorist organization.
   ``We honor our international obligations and we shall not make
any unilateral step, like imposing Israeli rule on the territories
that are subject to negotiations,'' Shamir said Thursday.
   His reference was to the U.S.-mediated Camp David accords
reached by Israel and Egypt in 1978, which call for five years of
autonomy for Palestinians before negotiations on the final status
of land captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.

   A 9-year-old girl who lost her legs to
frostbite after she was found abandoned in an unheated apartment
last winter has told those who helped and prayed for her, ``Because
of you, I am standing up today.''
   ``I want to thank all the people in the world for remembering me
and (for) all the donations they've given me and gifts and cards
and letters and their love and prayers,'' Darlwin Carlisle said,
smiling before TV cameras at a news conference Thursday.
   Darlwin's ordeal touched hearts nationwide following news
reports that she was found locked inside a Gary apartment Jan. 17
by a construction worker who said he heard a child's voice plead,
``Please don't board me up.''
   Hundreds of presents, thousands of letters and donations of at
least $125,000 poured in to cheer her up and help pay hospital
bills after her severely frostbitten legs were amputated just below
the knee. Officials of Gainer Bank in Gary said a trust account and
a guardianship account for Darlwin now amount to $140,000.
   After going through a rehabilitation program in Chicago, Darlwin
walked out of the hospital on artificial legs April 19.
   Upon leaving the hospital, officials wouldn't let her talk to
reporters, but on Thursday she held a news conference, with her
great-grandmother, Katie Carlisle, by her side, to say thanks.
   ``Because of you, I am standing up today,'' the girl told her
supporters.
   ``It was her idea,'' said Katie Carlisle, who Darlwin lives with
now. ``Sometimes we answer 30 or 40 cards a day. She thought going
on television might be a way to thank everyone at once.''
   As the television cameras rolled, she also sang a song she had
written, with the words: ``Had it not been for the Lord on my side,
where would I be? Where would I be?''
   Darlwin said she plans to return to school in the fall.
   Her mother, Darlwin Britt, pleaded guilty to child neglect May
6. She was sentenced to 14 years in prison May 27 by Lake Superior
Court Judge Richard W. Maroc, who blamed the neglect on the
mother's admitted cocaine use.

<TEXT>
   A long-debated experiment to distribute free,
clean needles to 200 drug addicts in an effort to slow the spread
of AIDS has been judged legal and will begin soon, the city's
health commissioner said.
   Dr. Stephen C. Joseph said in an interview published in today's
New York Times that the experiment is expected to begin in about 10
weeks.
   Needles are already distributed in several other countries. But
despite nationwide debate, no government agency has yet done so in
the United States.
   If New York's start-up program is successful, officials hope to
broaden the distribution among the city's estimated 200,000
intravenous drug-abusers. Sample blood tests indicate about half
that group are already infected with the AIDS virus.
   The experiment was approved this week by the state Health
Department and local prosecutors have judged it to be legal, the
Times said.
   Critics of the needles plan, including some prosecutors and
black officials, contend it will promote illicit drug abuse.
   ``The end is commendable, of course,'' said Manhattan Borough
President David N. Dinkins, a black who is against the plan. ``But
I maintain that drug use is unacceptable, and I do not accept the
notion that we can make drugs safer.''
   In New York City, needle use has become the leading method of
infection for new AIDS cases.
   The 200 people to receive needles will be chosen from waiting
lists of addicts seeking drug treatment. Another 200 will be chosen
as a control group; they will not receive needles but their drug
behavior and AIDS infection will be monitored.
   Anyone who receives free needles will be required to turn in
used ones each time they get another, to prevent improper
distribution of the needles.

business than about our great religions.'' _ The Detroit News.

   ``What many may find truly disturbing about the film is not its

contrived by the devil who hides in cameras.'' _ The New York Times.

   Accused ringleader Wesley David Gonzalez, 26, earned a living
from prostitution from age 12 to 16, eventually giving it up to
start the pedophile ring eight years ago, said Detective Robert
Sheehan.
   The Tampa-based operation came to light when the parents of an
11-year-old contacted police after wondering how their son got
large amounts of cash.
   A four-month probe led to the arrests of Gonzalez and two other
Floridians in June, police disclosed Wednesday. The investigation
continues, and authorities say they expect more arrests in other
cities.
   For eight years, the network sent boys to Atlanta, Denver,
Boston, Indianapolis and Chicago to meet adult clients, said Tampa
Sgt. Ronald J. Reynolds.
   Gonzalez, an unemployed avionics technician, understood the
psyche of the boys he hired _ most of them from poor families and
broken homes _ because he was once one of them, Sheehan said. He
used boys to recruit others, flashing wads of cash as a lure,
Sheehan said.
   ``A lot of the kids despised the sex, but the financial
inducements were too enticing to the youngsters,'' said Sheehan.
   The underground child prostitution operation involved hundreds
of youths ages 11 to 16, who earned from $300 to $700 for a single
meeting, police said.
   Getting the boys to admit their activities was difficult because
of a quiet bond between them, and officials said that slowed the
investigation.
   ``The members' loyalty stood even when faced with prison,''
Sheehan said.
   Gonzalez, also known as Michael David Gonzalez, was arrested in
June on a Tampa warrant charging him with capital sexual battery,
procuring children under 16 for prostitution and deriving financial
support from prostitution, according to Sheehan. He is being held
without bond.
   The others arrested were identified as car salesman Larry
Gorman, 38, and Michael Leroy Johnson, 30, who works for a paint
company. Johnson was charged with lewd and lascivious acts with a
child; Gorman was charged with performing a sexual act with a
child. Both were released on bond.

<HEAD>President Appeals For Political Truce During Olympics</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs to update with campus clashes. Pick up 8th

<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo called today for
a political truce during the Olympics and warned that violent
protests would expose the country to ``worldwide scorn.''
   Roh condemned demonstrations by radical students and said
dissident groups were trying to spoil the mood before the Sept. 17
start of the Olympic Games in Seoul. He appealed to opposition
leaders to support the government in curbing unrest.
   ``An eruption of demonstrations involving firebombs, stones and
tear gas during the Olympics would disrupt the Olympics and our
nation would become an object of worldwide scorn,'' Roh told a
meeting reviewing Olympic preparations.
   Later, radical students battled riot police with firebombs and
rocks at least three campuses in Seoul after rallies to prepare for
a march Monday to the border for reunification talks with North
Korean students.
   Riot police fired tear gas to drive students back. Eyewitnesses
reported some arrests and injuries, but police refused to give any
figures.
   National Police Headquarters in Seoul said today that 2,099
radicals were detained the previous two days for taking part in
demonstrations to support the Monday march, which the government
has prohibited. All but 243 students were released.
   Police officials said 13 police stations were attacked by
students nationwide this week and several dozen officers were
injured.
   Radical students have staged scattered protests in Seoul and
other cities to prepare for the march and fought riot police in
minor confrontations in some places. Turnouts at rallies during the
past five days have been low.
   A similar march June 10 for talks with North Korean student
delegates was blocked by riot police. Support for the latest march
appears to be low because of public opposition, a summer heat wave
and college vacations.
   Also today, Assembly Speaker Kim Chae-sun suggested that
delegates from North and South Korea meet at Panmunjom next Friday
to discuss the possibility of a North-South parliamentary meeting.
The North has proposed the discussion be held Wednesday.
   South Korea's National Assembly made its counterproposal in a
letter delivered to North Korea through the truce village of
Panmunjom inside the Demilitarized Zone.
   In a letter sent to South Korea on Tuesday, North Korea said the
working meeting, if held, should discuss only logistical
arrangements for full parliamentary talks which it hopes would be
held before the end of this month.
   Radical students have seized on the reunification issue to try
to mobilize public support for their anti-government campaign. The
students, a small but vocal minority on college campuses, have
failed to gain support because of their violent tactics and open
advances to the communist North.
   The peninsula has been divided since 1945 at the end of World
War II. North Korea invaded the South in 1950 to start the Korean
War.
   The North is demanding that Seoul to let it be a co-host at the
Games, but the International Olympic Committee has said the
Olympics cannot be shared.
   As a result, North Korea said it will boycott the event.
   South Korea today welcomed the International Olympic Committee's
latest attempt to persuade North Korea to change its mind.
   On Thursday, IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch proposed that
the North and South Korean teams could march side by side in the
opening and closing ceremonies, each carrying its own flag, while a
single Olympic flag preceded the overall Korean group.
   He said North Korean participation would demonstrate its
``strong desire for dialogue and reconciliation.''
   ``We are still very anxious to have their participation,'' said
Shin Hyon-ung, director general of international press for the
Seoul Olympic Organizing Committee.
   ``If North Korea accepts the IOC offer, it would be a very good
idea to march in parallel with North Korea in the opening
ceremony,'' Shin said.

   A newspaper reporter researching a story on a
hang glider pilot died along with the pilot when the craft
plummeted about 300 feet and crashed, authorities said.
   Nick Adams, a feature writer for the Springfield News-Sun, and
pilot Scott Beyer died Thursday at the Greene County Skydiving
Center about three miles east of this southwest Ohio city.
Witnesses said the glider crashed nose-first.
   Adams, 33, was doing a story on Beyer, 36, and his business,
High Attitude. Adams had gone along for the ride, taking pictures
with a camera mounted on one of the wings. A counterweight was
installed on the other wing.
   Sgt. David Albrinck of the State Highway Patrol said the
glider's tow rope may have wrapped around one wing when the craft
was banking for a turn. The tow rope is attached to a vehicle on
the ground to get the craft airborne.
   Adams, a Yellow Springs resident, had been with the paper for
three years.
   Dick Minnig, the paper's assistant city editor, said Adams
always looked for offbeat stories. ``He shined at doing people
stories,'' Minnig said.
   Sky-diving instructor Rob Seibel of Skydive Greene County
described Beyer, also of Yellow Springs, as an expert hang glider
pilot.

<TEXT>
   A reputed drug kingpin in prison and 36 other
people, including his parents, wife and girlfriend, were charged
with running a narcotics cartel linked to the assassination of a
police officer and nine other murders.
   Lorenzo ``Fat Cat'' Nichols, serving a 25-years-to-life sentence
for state narcotics and weapons law violations, was accused of
controlling the $20-million-a-year organization through his
lieutenants and family members.
   According to a federal complaint released Thursday, Nichols
continued to direct his drug operations from jail.
   ``This is really a story of how a handful of women kept this
drug operation together while their men were in prison,'' said Sgt.
Michael McGuiness.
   James Fox, head of the FBI's New York office, described the
Nichols group as ``the most active and most vicious drug ring in
New York City.''
   Thirty people _ including Nichols' parents, sister, three
nieces, wife, girlfriend and brother-in-law _ were arrested in a
sweep Thursday. Others were arrested out of state, said police
spokesman Joseph Gallagher.
   They were charged with distributing heroin and cocaine.
   No murder charges were filed. But the federal complaint stated
that members of the Nichols organization are suspected in at least
10 narcotics-related homicides since 1985, including that of police
Officer Edward Byrne and Nichols' parole officer, Brian Rooney, in
1985.
   Byrne was shot execution-style in February as he sat in his
police cruiser, guarding the home of a drug witness.
   ``The death of Officer Byrne was a catalyst to all of us in law
enforcement,'' said U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney. ``Whatever made
them commit that insane act of murder has backfired on this
organization.''
   Nichols, his alleged lieutenant, Howard ``Pappy'' Mason, and
others were previously charged with Rooney's murder.
   The complaint attributed its information to 12 confidential
informants and taps on the phones at the house of Nichols' sister,
Viola, and a deli which allegedly served as a Nichols headquarters.
   The Nichols organization was said to include a network of drug
suppliers, baggers, dealers and money handlers who distribute
heroin and cocaine throughout the New York City area.

   Relatives of people who died in the world's worst
single-plane accident today marked the third anniversary of the
disaster by visiting the mountain where the jumbo jet crashed.
   About 120 relatives and 30 officials of Japan Air Lines,
including president Susumu Yamachi, attended a ceremony in heavy
rain in Ueno-mura, 80 miles northwest of Tokyo.
   On Aug. 12, 1985, a Japan Air Lines Boeing 747 en route to Osaka
from Tokyo crashed and killed all but four of 524 people on board.
Organizers of victims' family groups said claims for compensation
from JAL and the Seattle-based Boeing Co. have been hindered
because of the number of people involved in two countries.
   ``It was the worst airplane accident the world has ever seen,
and the aftermath of the accident is highly complicated because the
case intertwines interests of more than one country and over
thousands of people,'' said Kuniko Miyajima, an organizer of
bereaved families.
   The Ministry of Transport last year concluded that faulty repair
work by Boeing and poor maintenance by JAL after a previous mishap
led to the rupture of a rear cabin wall on the aircraft, which
caused the crash.
   In 1979, the jumbo jet suffered a damaged bulkhead when it
skidded on its tail during a rough landing at Osaka International
Airport.
   So far, families of 334 victims have reached settlement with JAL
and Boeing Co., according to JAL officials.
   Most families of the remaining victims are either proceeding
with suits against JAL and Boeing or individually negotiating with
the companies through lawyers, according to Miyajima.
   Terms of compensation have not been disclosed either by the
companies or lawyers of the families of the victims. However,
sources who spoke on condition they not be identified said the cost
will be shared by the two companies with 17.5 percent paid by JAL
and 82.5 percent by Boeing.
   Both JAL and Boeing have admitted liability for the crash and
have reportedly offered about $100,000 to $135,000 compensation for
each victim, but Miyajima said she is not satisfied with the offer.
   ``Judging from cruelty of the accident and the pain which
bereaved people have to go through, our feeling is that victims
deserve at least more than what automobile accident victims get,''
said Miyajima, who lost her 9 year-old son in the crash.
   ``They have to consider that passengers were exposed to an
extreme degree of fear for half an hour while the aircraft was
flying in the air without control before crashing,'' she said.
   She also said about 30 bereaved relatives of the victims are
refusing even to negotiate because ``they cannot get over the pain
of facing the agony of losing their beloved ones every time they
sit at a negotiation table and discuss the accident.''

<HEAD>State Files Suit To Force Mecham To Relinquish Protocol Fund</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURIE ASSEO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Evan Mecham says a lawsuit
seeking to wrest an $80,000 protocal fund from him is ``frivolous''
and he expects to win a court fight over the money, which was
central to his impeachment conviction.
   The state of Arizona brought suit against Mecham on Thursday
aimed at forcing him to give the money to Gov. Rose Mofford, the
Democrat who succeeded Mecham when he was convicted on impeachment
charges April 4.
   Mecham, however, told reporters that he mailed the money back to
the original 687 contributors Thursday.
   Valley National Bank spokesman Steve Roman said the bank will
not pay on the checks until a court decides who is entitled to the
money.
   Mecham called the lawsuit ``one of the biggest travesties of a
waste of taxpayers' money on a frivolous lawsuit I've ever seen.''
   He predicted the court would declare the fund to be private
money, thus proving the Senate had no grounds to convict him of
misusing $80,000 from the fund by loaning it to his auto
dealership. Mecham also was convicted of trying to thwart a probe
of an alleged death threat.
   Attorney General Bob Corbin, who filed the civil suit, said he
believes the protocol fund belongs to the state. Corbin
unsuccessfully prosecuted Mecham in criminal court in May on
charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan.
   The lawsuit asks that Mecham be forced to give the state all the
money remaining in the account as of April 5, the day after he was
removed from office.
   Corbin and Mrs. Mofford decided to sue after Mecham rejected a
state offer that would have allowed him to return the money to the
donors after providing a full accounting of the funds and asking
the contributors if they wanted to give the money to charity.
   ``We've made an offer to him; he rejected it,'' Corbin said.
``That's still on the table.''
   The protocol fund at one time totaled about $92,000, but Mecham
has said some of the money was spent on state purposes.
   The fund was created with receipts from Mecham's January 1987
inaugural ball, and Mecham originally intended to use the receipts
to help repay his campaign debt. But questions were raised about
whether the inaugural fund raising complied with Arizona's campaign
finance law, and the money was converted to a protocol fund in June
1987 in an agreement with the Maricopa County Attorney's Office.
   That agreement, signed by Mecham Inaugural Committee Chairman
Bill Long, said the money was to be used ``solely for purposes of
promoting the interests of the state, or to promote and encourage
citizen public service to the state.''
   But Mecham has contended he was unaware of the agreement and is
not bound by it.
   The lawsuit said Mecham ``has for financial gain knowingly
exercised control over the protocol fund with the intent to deprive
the Office of the Governor of control of those funds.''

   A former stockbroker implicated in the widening
insider trading scandal involving leaked copies of Business Week
magazine has agreed to plead guilty to the first criminal charge
leveled in the case.
   William Dillon, 33, of Old Lyme, Conn., also agreed to cooperate
with federal investigators probing the alleged scheme to gain and
trade on advance knowledge of information due to appear in Business
Week's ``Inside Wall Street'' column.
   Dillon, a former Merrill Lynch & Co. stockbroker, was charged
with a single count of wire fraud in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan.
   As a formality, he pleaded innocent before a federal magistrate
but his attorney, Henry Putzel, and U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani
said Dillon subsequently would plead guilty.
   Dillon also agreed to give up all profits and to plead guilty to
a similar charge _ yet to be filed _ at federal court in
Connecticut, prosecutors said.
   He faces a maximum five-year prison sentence and $250,000 fine
on each wire fraud count.
   The U.S. attorney in Connecticut, Stanley A. Twardy Jr., said
Dillon agreed to cooperate with the investigation into securities
trading by people using information misappropriated from
McGraw-Hill Inc., publisher of Business Week, and R.R. Donnelley &
Sons Co., which prints the magazine.
   Seven Donnelley employees have been fired or have quit since the
printer began an in-house investigation.
   Dillon was charged with using the telephone in conjunction with
the inside information to buy 3,000 shares of Regency Electronics
Inc. common stock in January 1987.
   Federal court documents stated that, all told, Dillon allegedly
purchased 129 different securities between May 1986 and last month,
making some $94,000 in profits.
   Dillon's mother, Elizabeth Baird, whose brokerage account at
another firm allegedly was used for making trades on the inside
information, will have to give up her profits, although officials
had placed no fixed sum on that amount, Giuliani said.
   Giuliani said that as part of Dillon's cooperation agreement,
his mother would not be charged with wrongdoing.
   Merrill Lynch fired Dillon, a financial consultant in its New
London, Conn., office, late last month.
   The dismissal came a week after Business Week said it was
probing pre-publication trading linked to ``Inside Wall Street.''
The Securities and Exchange Commission and the major stock
exchanges also have launched investigations.
   At the time, Merrill Lynch said Dillon was fired after company
lawyers uncovered records suggesting stocks might have been bought
and sold on tips from articles due to be published in the magazine.
   Court papers indicated Dillon and an unidentified person paid
various Donnelley employees $20 to $30 an issue for advance copies
of Business Week on Thursday mornings. The magazine generally was
made available to the public after the markets closed Thursday
afternoons.
   Dillon was accused of trading Thursday mornings on the
securities of companies that got a favorable mention in ``Inside
Wall Street.''

<HEAD>Newspaper Publishes Guidelines For Use Of Anonymous Sources</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A confidential source whose identification by
the Star Tribune resulted in a jury verdict against the newspaper
has prompted new guidelines at the newspaper on using anonymous
sources.
   In a front page announcement Thursday, the newspaper described
the new guidelines to its readers.
   ``We know that some readers are concerned about recent questions
involving the use of anonymous sources in the Star Tribune. So are
we, and we're taking action to deal with those questions,'' Star
Tribune Executive Editor Joel Kramer wrote.
   The announcement follows a verdict granting damages to a public
relations man who gave the paper and other news organizations
information about a political opponent's shoplifting charge six
days before a 1982 election. He gave the information on condition
he would remain anonymous and claimed in his suit that
identification of him by the Star Tribune and the St. Paul Pioneer
Press Dispatch hurt his career.
   Kramer also said a recent Star Tribune article on the University
of Minnesota Hospital that reported on ``alleged wrongdoing on the
basis of anonymous sources who didn't have firsthand knowledge to
support their account'' illustrated the risks to fairness and
accuracy that can result from use of anonymous sources.
   In a third recent incident, the Star Tribune recalled all
640,000 copies of its Sunday magazine scheduled to appear one
weekend because, Kramer said, a person quoted by name in the
magazine said she had been promised anonymity.
   The guidelines make three main points, Kramer said:
   _While anonymous sources are a critical element of some
important stories, frequent reliance on them increases the risk of
inaccurate or unfair journalism and can adversely affect the
newspaper's credibility with readers.
   _Anonymous statements and quotes should be published only when
necessary to provide important information and only after both a
reporter and editor are satisfied that the paper is meeting its
standards for accuracy and fairness.
   _Promises of confidentiality to sources that are not in the
newspaper's or the readers' best interests should be avoided, but
once made, will be honored except in the most extraordinary
circumstances.
   Kramer said the guidelines ``replace the mostly unwritten
guidelines and standards we've relied on before.''
   On July 22, a Hennepin County District Court jury found that the
Star Tribune and the Pioneer Press Dispatch broke a contract by
identifying Dan Cohen as a confidential source for a story and must
pay him a total of $700,000 in damages. The newspapers are
appealing the verdict.
   Reporters for the two newspapers, who separately accepted court
documents from Cohen on condition his identity not be revealed,
were overruled by their editors, who decided to name Cohen.
   Kramer said that, under the new guidelines, ``a reporter should
not promise anonymity in a situation similar to Cohen's, but if the
reporter makes such a promise, the editors will honor it.''

   Seven out of 10 American voters think the United
States can trust the Soviet Union enough to sign a treaty
eliminating most of both nations' nuclear weapons by the turn of
the century, according to a poll.
   Such developments as the Reagan-Gorbachev summits and the Soviet
withdrawal from Afghanistan are eroding Americans' longstanding
mistrust of the Soviet Union, pollster Daniel Yankelovich said
Thursday.
   But he said six in 10 voters still regard the Soviet Union as
``a serious threat'' to the United States, and more than a third
trust the Soviets ``not at all.''
   The poll was one of several commissioned for ``Americans Talk
Security,'' a series of surveys on national defense and security
issues financed by Boston businessman Alan F. Kay.
   In telephone interviews with 1,000 registered voters,
Yankelovich's firm found a majority trusted the Soviets enough to
believe that the United States and the Soviet Union could:
   _ Sign a treaty to eliminate most nuclear weapons by the year
2000 (71 percent).
   _ Work together to stop illicit drug trafficking (85 percent);
halt environmental pollution (85 percent); fight terrorism (78
percent); resolve conflicts in the Mideast and other trouble spots
(72 percent).
   _ Expand cultural exchanges (84 percent).
   The survey, taken in July shortly after the Moscow summit, noted
a 7 percent increase _ to 68 percent _ from March in American
voters' belief that relations with the Soviets are improving.
   But Yankelovich also noted a persistent strain of mistrust
toward the Soviet Union, with 60 percent describing it as a major
threat to the United States, down from 76 percent before Gorbachev
took office.
   Only 36 percent thought the United States should sell
non-military high technology to the Soviets; 34 percent would stop
work on Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative as part of a nuclear
arms agreement; 28 percent favored sharing SDI technology with the
Soviets as it is developed.
   Women without a college education were far more mistrustful of
the Soviets and Gorbachev than similarly educated men or
college-educated men and women, a finding which Democratic pollster
John Marttila said ``flies somewhat in the face of conventional
wisdom.''
   Although 37 percent of all voters said they trusted the Soviet
Union ``not at all,'' 43 percent of women took that stand, compared
with only 30 percent of men.
   Referring to Vice President George Bush's ``gender gap,''
Republican pollster Frank McBride said, ``This (information) is
something the vice president can use in his campaign.''
   The poll has a margin of error of 3 percent.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who says he witnessed the downing of
George Bush's Navy bomber during World War II has challenged the
vice president's contention that the aircraft was on fire when he
bailed out, leaving behind two crew mates who were presumed dead,
The New York Post reported today.
   Chester Mierzejewski, 68, of Cheshire, Conn., said in interviews
with the Post that the plane was not engulfed in flames, as Bush
has claimed, and that Bush could have made a water landing and
possibly saved the lives of the two men.
   ``I think he (Bush) could have saved those lives, if they were
alive,'' Mierzejewski told the newspaper. ``I don't know that they
were, but at least they had a chance if he had attempted a water
landing.''
   Bush has referred to the Sept. 2, 1944, downing in the
presidential campaign this year and described it in detail in
interviews and in his autobiography.
   Describing the scene in his book, Bush wrote his aircraft was
hit on a diving run to bomb a Japanese radio installation in the
South Pacific's Bonin Islands.
   ``Smoke poured into the cockpit, and I could see flames rippling
across the crease of the wing, edging toward the fuel tanks,'' Bush
wrote. He said he finished dropping the bombs and then, losing
control of his plane, ejected over the ocean after radioing his
gunner and radioman to jump and getting no response.
   In a television interview aired last December, Bush described
the ordeal as ``about as close as you get'' to death. ``The plane
was in smoke and the wings were burning,'' he said.
   Mierzejewski, who was the turret gunner in the tail of squadron
commander Douglas Melvin's plane, which led the tight formation
bombing raid, disagreed.
   He said he was ``about 100 feet'' ahead of Bush's plane and saw
only ``a puff of smoke'' which quickly dissipated. There was no
more smoke, he said, and he insists Bush's ``plane was never on
fire'' and that ``no smoke came out of his cockpit when he opened
his canopy to bail out.''
   The intelligence report on the loss of Bush's plane reports that
``smoke and flame'' engulfed Bush's engine, according to the Post.
The report was signed by Melvin and an intelligence officer, now
deceased.
   Squadron members interviewed by the Post disagreed about whether
Mierzejewski would have had the best line of sight on Bush's plane,
and Mierzejewski was the only one to claim he saw the plane downed.
   Mierzejewski said that after Bush was rescued and returned to
their aircraft carrier 30 days later, Bush approached Mierzejewski
and, ``he said: `Ski, I'm sure those two men were dead. I called
them on the radio three times. They were dead.' ...
   ``He seemed distraught. He was trying to assure me he did the
best he could. I'm thinking, what am I going to say to him? I have
to give him the benefit of the doubt.''
   Mierzejewski said he wrote Bush this March to tell him his
public descriptions were ``entirely different from my recall of the
incident,'' but did not hear back from the vice president.
   Steve Hart, Bush's press secretary, told the Post Thursday that
Bush ``has told us time and time again what happened that day. To
suggest that his account is inaccurate is absurd.''

   Sales of Roanoke County's sesquicentennial
coin are proving that good spelling isn't always good business _
collectors and the curious are seeking to obtain coins that
misspell the word ``beautiful'' as ``beautitul.''
   ``As far as we can tell, we're getting more calls since the
mistake was found,'' said Carolyn Wagner of the sesquicentennial
committee. ``I think people mainly are calling to get the coins
with the misspelling, but if they can't get those, they want the
correct ones.''
   Even some banks have called asking for the misspelled coins,
which are being sold in commemoration of the county's founding in
1838, Ms. Wagner said.
   A county employee discovered the blunder after 300 coins had
been sold.
   The misspelled ``beautiful'' was correct in a proof county
officials saw. A minter has acknowledged making the error.

   Cincinnati Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk,
dressed in a bathrobe and pajamas, waved as a nurse wheeled him out
of Good Samaritan Hospital 2{ weeks after brain surgery.
   ``It's the best I can do,'' he said said in a strong, clear
voice. ``My doctor won't let me do any more.''
   The spiritual leader of 545,000 Roman Catholics in 19 Ohio
counties was released Thursday with the assurance that his recovery
would be complete. He will rest at home for two weeks, doctors said.
   Pilarczyk, who is 54 today, underwent surgery July 25 to repair
a ruptured aneurysm, or weakened artery wall, at the base of his
brain.
   ``All his mental functions are 100 percent intact. There will be
no long-term effects of the surgery,'' said Dr. Thomas Brott.
   During his recuperation, Pilarczyk will conduct no business,
said the Rev. Ted Kosse, the archdiocese's spokesman. Auxiliary
Bishop James Garland is running the archdiocese in Pilarczyk's
absence.
   The aneurysm ruptured while Pilarczyk was vacationing in
Gatlinburg, Tenn. He was airlifted to Cincinnati by helicopter.
   His recovery went smoothly until July 28, when he suffered a
common side effect of the surgery called an arterial spasm, which
narrows the artery so blood cannot get through. He was given an
experimental drug called nicardipine, which relaxes the artery wall
and prevents further spasms.
   About 5,000 of the 25,000 people who survive burst aneurysms
each year die from arterial spasms after surgery.

   A powerful explosion in the Zambian
capital injured five people and damaged three houses, authorities
said today.
   Police said the blast in Lusaka's Olympia suburb happened late
Thursday and that bomb disposal experts and detectives were combing
the area for more explosive devices.
   No further details were available and it was not immediately
known whether the blast was politically motivated.
   The African National Congress, the main guerrilla organization
fighting the South African government, has its headquarters in
Lusaka.
   Two bombings in residential Lusaka this year have been blamed on
agents of the South African government. One person was slightly
injured in one of them.
   South Africa has mounted several military and sabotage attacks
against its black-governed neighbors whose governments provide
sanctuary for South African exiles and ANC activists.

   The Iranian Embassy indicated it would help in the
search for foreign hostages in Lebanon if Britain continues efforts
to find four Iranians believed held in Lebanon.
   British diplomat David Reddaway arrived in Tehran today for
talks about the hostages. It is Britain's first diplomatic visit to
Iran in a year.
   Those developments, along with meetings in London between an
Iranian envoy and Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, raised
new hopes for the release of the three Britons held hostage in
Lebanon.
   ``I think it is bound to help,'' Reddaway, a senior official at
the British Foreign Ministry, said of his Tehran visit. Speaking
before leaving from Heathrow Airport, he said that while in Iran he
planned to assess the possibility of Britain resuming diplomatic
ties.
   Britain withdrew its diplomats from Iran a year ago after one
was beaten up in apparent reprisal for the arrest of an Iranian
envoy in England on shoplifting charges.
   Neither the Iranian Embassy nor Runcie, who left for a
three-week vacation in Philadelphia, would comment on Runcie's
Wednesday night talks with Mohamed Reza Said Mohamedi, an Iranian
Foreign Ministry official.
   Runcie is the spiritual head of the Church of England. Church
envoy Terry Waite is among the three British hostages.
   An Anglican bishop went to Lebanon last month to initiate
inquiries about the fate of four Iranians believed kidnapped by
Christians in Lebanon.
   A statement from the Iranian Embassy, released Thursday night,
said:
   ``1. Any attempt in locating the Iranian hostages in Lebanon
would be appreciated by the entire people of Iran.
   ``2. We are sincerely exploring the possibilities and ways of
mutual assistance in tracing non-Iranian hostages in Lebanon.
   ``3. We fully share the views expressed by the archbishop of
Canterbury and appreciate his initiatives in solving this problem.''
   Pro-Iranian extremists are believed to hold 18 foreigners,
including nine Americans, hostage in Lebanon. The Hezbollah
faction, over which the Iranian government wields considerable
influence, is believed to be the umbrella organization for groups
holding the hostages.
   Waite disappeared in Lebanon in January 1987 while trying to
secure the release of hostages.
   The other Britons missing are television journalist John
McCarthy, who was kidnapped April 17, 1986, and teacher Brian
Keenan from Northern Ireland, who has been missing since April 11,
1986. Keenan holds British and Irish nationality.
   The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March
16,1985.
   The Foreign Office said the catalyst for sending a diplomat to
Tehran was Iran's agreement July 18 to accept a U.N. cease-fire in
its war with Iraq.
   A British Broadcasting Corp. Middle East correspondent, Keith
Graves, reported that the agreement had led to control of the
hostages being passed from Hezbollah to a group of ``hard-line
Iranian Revolutionary Guards.''
   Graves said the hard-liners opposed Hashemi Rafsanjani, head of
Iran's armed forces, because of his agreement to a cease-fire and
his ``willingness'' to have the foreign hostages released from
Lebanon.

<HEAD>World's Biggest Port Debates South African Coal Imports</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anti-apartheid groups oppose plans
to build a new port terminal here unless the coal importer pushing
the idea embargoes South African coal. But high unemployment is
making the project hard to turn down.
   About 44 percent of the 10.7 million tons of coal shipped
through Rotterdam, the world's biggest port, come from South
Africa, according to city government statistics.
   The Frans Swarttouw company, which claims to handle a third of
Rotterdam's coal import business, wants to build a $46.7 million
coal terminal. Rotterdam city officials are debating whether to
invest $57 million in new roads, docks and other construction works
that would go up around the terminal.
   The projects could help curb the city's 25 percent unemployment.
   The Kairos anti-apartheid group wants approval of the $57
million investment contingent on a Swarttouw promise not to handle
any South African coal.
   ``The handling of South African coal is a serious stain on the
port of Rotterdam,'' Kairos wrote in a recent letter to City Hall.
``Transshipment here helps shippers to conceal the coal's South
African origin.''
   According to Kairos, large amounts of South African coal are
being shipped from Rotterdam to nations that have embargoed South
African coal.
   The left-wing Labor Party, which holds a 24-seat majority in the
45-seat city council, said in its 1986 election platform that ``The
port of Rotterdam may not be abused for ... the import of products
from South Africa, particularly coal.''
   Swarttouw's general director, Hans Sjouke, conceded Thursday
that about a third of the coal handled by Swarttouw is of South
African origin, but said ``If you want to impose a boycott (of
South African coal) I think you want to talk to the consumers at
the end of the line.''
   Most of the coal imported via Rotterdam is used by electric
power stations in the Netherlands and other European nations.
   The new terminal, scheduled for completion in 1998, has been
designed to handle coal carriers of up to 250,000 tons, in line
with a current trend toward the use of larger vessels, Sjouke said
in a telephone interview.
   There is strong public and official disapproval in the
Netherlands of apartheid, South Africa's system of racial
segregation. The Dutch government supports tougher sanctions
against South Africa by the 12 member nations of the European
Economic Community but refuses to impose a South African coal
import ban until all 12 EEC members agree to do the same.
   France and Denmark are the only two EEC member nations that have
imposed such an embargo, along with the United States.

<HEAD>Most Intensive-Care Patients Would Undergo Treatment Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study finds that most elderly patients who
survived one life-threatening illness would submit to intensive
care a second time, but doctors say that finding leads to serious
questions about the use of resources.
   ``We undertook this study to help doctors deal with one dilemma
_ when to use life-sustaining treatment _ and we've come up with
another,'' said Dr. Marion Danis, one of the authors of the study
published in today's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   The subjects of the study were 160 people, 55 or older, who were
admitted to intensive care at North Carolina Memorial Hospital in
Chapel Hill for at least 24 hours during 1983, the authors said.
   Of those interviewed, 74 percent later reported they would be
completely willing to undergo intensive care again to prolong
survival for any period, even as brief as one month, the study said.
   Four percent said they were unwilling to undergo more intensive
care for any period. Of the remaining 22 percent, most expressed
varying preferences depending on duration of survival.
   ``The patients in our study are saying they want to receive
highly technical care under almost any condition _ as late as the
last month of their life,'' Ms. Danis of the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill said Thursday.
   ``And our society is going to have to think about what's the
most appropriate use of our medical-care resources. It may turn out
that these are wishes that will prove very difficult to fill.''
   The patients' preferences appeared to hold true regardless of
quality of life, life expectancy, age, severity of illness, length
of stay or intensive-care cost, the study found.
   Families surveyed on behalf of patients who had died or been
left incompetent after intensive-care treatment felt the same way,
indicating the feeling did not depend on successful treatment.
   ``You have to recognize the limitations of the study,'' Ms.
Danis said. ``The patients who provided our subjects already had
shown a willingess to undergo intensive-care treatment in the face
of one life-threatening illness. But that could also be one of its
strengths.
   ``Many times, doctors face life-sustaining decisions without any
input from the patients. This study informs physicians about the
opinions of patients who've been in that spot.''
   But one researcher questioned the finding that quality of life
concerns had just a small impact on patient preference.
   In an editorial accompanying the study, Nancy R. Zweibel of the
University of Chicago's department of medicine, said the study
dealt with quality-of-life considerations only in a general way.
   ``Evidence suggests that when faced with such decisions,
patients consider a number of more concrete factors,'' such as the
presence and level of long-term pain, likelihood of getting better,
ability for self-care and mobility, ability to think straight and
burden on family, said Ms. Zweibel, a researcher in social policy
and aging.

   Sea lions along the West Coast are being
stricken by a disease that is contagious to humans, and a marine
expert is warning people not to approach the ailing creatures that
may be found on beaches.
   More than 40 sick or dying animals infected with the the
microorganism leptospira have been found on beaches this summer,
said Peigin Barrett, executive director of the Marine Mammal Center
in Marin County.
   Leptospirosis last hit the California sea lion population in
1984, killing as many as 10,000 of the animals. Barret said the
microorganisms invade the kidneys and liver and warned that humans
should not approach the creatures if they are found on a beach.
   ``We want to make sure people stay away from stricken animals,''
Barrett said. ``We have really serious concern for both animals and
people.''
   Mary Jane Schramm of the Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito said
news about the disease had sparked a mild panic among fishermen,
surfers and others who frequent beaches. However, she said even
those who handle sea lions for a living are unlikely to contract
the disease. ``We're not that worried about it,'' she said.
   ``There's no cause for alarm for leptospirosis in California sea
lions,'' Denize Springer, assistant to the executive director of
the mammal center, said Thursday.
   The ailing sea lions are being treated with tetracycline, but
the mortality rate is 39 percent, Barrett said.
   Initial reports of ailing sea lions began in early June. Barrett
said that through Wednesday, center volunteers had responded to 43
cases, with a current rate of two a day. When the animals get too
weak to swim, they come ashore, Barrett said. The animals have been
found from San Luis Obispo to the Oregon boundary.
   Scientists are puzzled by both the cause of the disease and its
present occurrence, since the epidemic seems to strike every 10
years, Barrett said.

<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia has asked West
Germany to try a former Nazi SS concentration camp guard the
Czech's sentenced to death in absentia in 1948, the Communist daily
Rude Pravo said today.
   Czechoslovakia sentenced Anton Maloth, 76, after convicting him
of committing war crimes at the Theresienstadt concentration camp,
where about 33,700 people died. On Tuesday, Czechoslovakia asked
Italy to extradite him.
   Italian officials put Maloth on an airplane from Verona to
Munich on Wednesday, after his arrest last week at his wife's home
in the northern Italian town of Merano.
   Italy and Czechoslovakia have no extradition treaty, and Italian
law bars extraditing someone facing the death penalty. Italy does
not have capital punishment.
   West German Foreign Ministry spokesman Peter Rothen said
officials determined Maloth is a West German citizen and cannot be
extradited under its constitution.
   A West German prosecutor said Thursday that Maloth was
hospitalized near Munich with unspecified ``serious illnesses''
that will prevent interrogation for at least three weeks.
   Prosecutor Klaus Schacht, who is leading the inquiry into
Maloth's past, said he has no plans to bring criminal charges
against the former concentration camp guard.
   West German officials say Maloth, who wants to return to Italy,
is free to move about as he pleases.
   Rude Pravo said Czechoslovakia's ambassador in Bonn, Dusan
Spacil, has asked West German authorities to ``take necessary steps
to bring Maloth to court.''
   It said Czechoslovakia is handing over results of its
investigations into Maloth's past to West German authorities to
facilitate prosecution.
   The director of the national memorial in the town where the Nazi
camp was located told Rude Pravo that 2,400 documents provide
evidence of Maloth's crimes.
   The CTK news agency, which carried excerpts of the interview,
quoted Vaclav Novak as saying the crimes included ``grievous bodily
harms, killings and murders.''
   Maloth ``voluntarily and with pleasure asked to be a member of
execution squads,'' Novak told Rude Pravo.
   CTK quoted Novak as saying ``several dozen'' witnesses to
Maloth's crimes are still alive.
   Vienna-based Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal said Maloth hid with
his family in Italy for 15 years.

<TEXT>
   A Polish dancer who defected to Israel to join
a woman he fell in love with has learned she already was engaged to
be married, Israel radio and the woman's friends said today.
   Polish officials in Israel said they would not force the dancer,
identified as Sigmund Irinauch, to return, and Israeli officials
said he could stay at least until his visa expires on Aug. 29.
   Irinauch, in the late 20s, disappeared Tuesday after his
46-member Slovianki dance company performed at a festival in the
northern port of Haifa.
   Haifa police said he defected to join an Israeli folk dancer he
met when both were performing in Canada two years ago. The daily
Maariv newspaper said Irinauch wrote regularly to the woman, who
the radio identified as Mira Katz, a nurse and a member of the Hora
Jerusalem dancing troupe.
   The woman's friends said in interviews that Irinauch told Miss
Katz he planned to defect, but she then disclosed she was engaged
to be married.
   Irinauch still decided to defect, partly because he is Jewish,
the friends said on condition of anonymity. They said Miss Katz and
her fiance, Doron Alter, agreed to help.
   The radio said Irinauch was hiding at Alter's home in the town
of Beer Yaakov near Tel Aviv. Telephone calls to the home today
went unanswered.
   Miss Katz refused to discuss the defection, except to say: ``I'm
calm. I know he has nothing to fear, and that everything will be
all right,'' the radio reported.
   Bronislaw Stavinsky, a diplomat at the Polish interest office in
Tel Aviv, said Poland would not seek the dancer's extradition, but
he was free to return to Poland if he wished.
   Under Israel's Law of Return, all Jews have the right to
automatic Israeli citizenship. The legal adviser at the Foreign
Ministry, Robert Sabel, said a non-Jewish defector could receive
political asylum also, as long as the defector proves political
persecution in his or her home country.

<TEXT>
   The classified ad offering to sell an
observatory's satellite dishes worth millions for $500 was
obviously a prank to everyone but the reader who called up to buy
five.
   The ad, taken out by four students who worked as summer
employees at the observatory, appeared in Wednesday's Albuquerque
Journal. It read: ``Must go! 28 used 82 ft satellite dishes, HBO _
you bet! $25 million new, must leave state,'' and said it would
sell them for $500 or ``or best offer.''
   Rick Perley, an official with the National Radio Astronomy
Observatory whose name was listed in the ad for prospective buyers
to call, said one caller obviously thought it was the buy of a
lifetime.
   ``They wanted to reserve five of them,'' Perley said. ``We don't
know who (the would-be buyer) is. The secretary who took the call
hadn't seen the ad; she didn't know what it was he was talking
about.''
   ``It was just kind of a practical joke,'' Ed Murphy, who will be
a senior at the University of Illinois this fall, said of why he
and friends took out the ad. ``We heard it had been done once
before at an observatory in West Virginia, so we had the idea and
decided to do it.''
   ``It's very funny from their point of view,'' Perley said, ``but
we take our responsibility of having the public's money very
seriously. We can't possibly condone this. We don't want people to
think we don't do our jobs.''
   The observatory's Very Large Array cost $78 million and began
operating in 1980. Most recently it was linked with radio dishes in
California to receive signals from deep-space probe Voyager 2 as it
approaches Neptune.

<TEXT>
   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha
today held talks with U.S., Soviet and British diplomats on
Pretoria's joining the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, a South
African diplomat said.
   The talks took place at the U.S. mission in Vienna, said a
secretary at the mission who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The South African diplomat, who also spoke on condition of
anonymity, said a series of bilateral meetings were planned along
with the talks.
   The South African Broadcasting Corp. reported Thursday that
Botha and South African Energy Minister Danie Steyn would convey
their government's willingness to open its nuclear facilities to
international inspection.
   In the past, South Africa has refused to sign the 1969 Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty and to submit all its nuclear facilities
to inspection by the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy
Agency.
   South Africa is widely believed to have the technical capability
to produce an atomic bomb, but there is debate about whether it
actually has produced any.
   The U.S. delegation to the talks is headed by Ambassador Richard
T. Kennedy and the Soviet delegation led by Moscow's permanent
representative to the international organization in Vienna, Timer
Baev, U.S. officials said.
   The British delegation is reportedly headed by Under Secretary
John Goulden. Botha and Steyn arrived in Vienna on Thursday.
   The International Atomic Energy Agency has said it is not
invloved in the discussions.
   South Africa has been under increasing pressure at the
International Atomic Energy Agency to submit its nuclear facilities
to inspection.
   African and other Third World member countries have repeatedly
attempted to have South Africa ousted as a member, largely because
of apartheid, the policy under which the nation's 26 million blacks
have no vote in national affairs.
   At last year's general assembly, a decision on South Africa's
expulsion was postponed after Pretoria announced it was considering
joining the treaty.
   Last month, diplomats in Vienna said they expected South Africa
to make a move before the next annual general assembly of the
International Atomic Energy Agency in September.
   The United States, the Soviet Union and Britain are the three
``nuclear weapon states'' that have joined the treaty, which so far
has been signed by a total of 137 countries. France and China, two
other countries with a known nuclear weapons potential, are not
signatory to the treaty.
   Under the treaty, signatories pledge to submit their nuclear
programs to agancy controls, and the agency's inspectors must make
sure material is not diverted to other than peaceful uses.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Murder Conviction in Weird Plot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The California Supreme Court has upheld the
life sentence of a contractor convicted of murdering a man while
planning a bizarre plot to take over Marin County with guns and
laser beams.
   The justices voted unanimously on Thursday not to grant a
hearing on an appeal by Mark Richards, who was convicted of killing
Richard Baldwin in July 1982 while making plans for the
paramilitary takeover of the county.
   According to police, Richards originated the plot known as
Pendragon, which involved blowing up bridges and taking control of
Marin County and seceding from the United States. The plot was
never attempted.
   It came to light after Baldwin's death and did not result in any
additional criminal charges.
   Authorities said Richards and one of his young proteges, Crossan
Hoover, entered Baldwin's garage, where Hoover hit Baldwin in the
head with a baseball bat.
   Richards owed Baldwin money in his business, and police said
Hoover was told he would be helping to solve Richards' financial
problems. Hoover's murder conviction also has been upheld.
   Richards was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility
of parole for the death of Baldwin.

   President P.W. Botha said
today that a tough sanctions bill passed by the U.S. House of
Representatives will not help South African blacks and might derail
a regional peace initiative.
   ``The recklessness of members of Congress who do not care in the
least whether their actions adversely affect the search for a
peaceful solution to the problems of southern Africa as a whole is
astounding,'' Botha said.
   He said the legislation, which was forwarded to the Senate after
a vote Thursday night, might ``obstruct or make impossible'' an
ongoing initiative to end South Africa's 73-year rule over
South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.
   The sanctions bill, which still needs Senate approval and
President Reagan's signature to become law, would halt U.S.
investment in South Africa and impose a near-total trade embargo.
It was approved by the House 244-132, with most Democrats
supporting it and most Republicans opposing it.
   The bill faces a possible Republican filibuster in the Senate
and a likely veto by Reagan. Earlier legislation, which passed
despite Reagan's veto, bars imports of various South African
commodities and forbids South African planes to land at U.S.
airports.
   Botha said in a statement that the pending bill was being
debated ``for purely internal political aims.''
   ``It (the bill) has no bearing on the promotion of the interests
of black people in South Africa,'' he said. ``The members of the
House of Representatives are by now fully aware that prominent
black leaders in South Africa, as well as governments in certain
neighboring states, strongly oppose this legislation.''
   Prominent black anti-apartheid leaders in South Africa,
including Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, have urged the West to
impose tougher sanctions as a means of pressuring the government to
grant full political rights to the black majority. Under Pretoria's
policy of apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote
in national affairs.
   Many black moderates and conservatives, as well as several
prominent white liberals, have supported Pretoria's contention that
sanctions will have the harshest effect on blacks and will harden
the white minority's resistance to political change.
   Botha said he found it ``particularly remarkable'' that the
House acted on the bill ``exactly at a time when positive progress
was being made with the peace negotiations between South Africa,
Cuba and Angola.''
   The three countries on Monday announced a cease-fire in the
13-year Angolan war. South Africa said it was prepared to start
granting independence to Namibia Nov. 1 as part of a U.N. plan,
provided an agreement was reached later this month on a timetable
for the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola.
   An estimated 50,000 Cuban troops have been supporting Angola's
Marxist government in its fight against the UNITA rebel movement.
UNITA, which is backed by the United States and South Africa, is
not a party to the cease-fire.
   ``It would be ironical if (the U.N. independence plan for
Namibia) should reach the point of implementation only to be
obstructed or made impossible as a result of provisions in the
American legislation,'' Botha said.

<HEAD>Official: More Than 83,000 Houses Destroyed by Sudan Floods</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Floods have destroyed about 83,000 homes in
Sudan's capital of Khartoum, more than twice the number previously
estimated, the Middle East News Agency reported today.
   The floods, which hit over the weekend after torrential rains,
caused shortages of electricity, drinking water and food in
Khartoum, a city of 4 million residents. At least 11 people were
killed, and Sudanese Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi said 1.5 million
people were left homeless.
   The United Nations said a lack of boats was hampering relief
operations for people stranded on piles of rubble.
   The Egyptian state-owned news agency quoted an unidentified
Sudanese official as saying the floods destroyed 83,240 houses in
the Khartoum area alone. Previous estimates ranged from 10,000 to
40,000.
   The new figure did not include the number of houses destroyed by
floods in eastern and northern areas of the country.
   Cairo newspapers today said Khartoum state television showed
Mahdi touring flooded areas in Khartoum and complaining that tents,
food and medicine were not reaching flood victims fast enough. He
blamed lack of coordination among government agencies.
   Among those worst hit are southern refugees, estimated at
750,000 to 1 million, who fled a 5-year-old civil war in the south
and are living in canvas, tin and mud huts on the outskirts of
Khartoum. Many of their flimsy shacks were washed away by flood
waters.
   Sudanese officials blamed the floods on inadequate drainage
systems. Last week, Khartoum and surrounding areas received 8.4
inches of rain, compared with 1.44 inches in all of 1987.
   Officials say the country faces more destruction from the annual
flooding of the Nile River in coming weeks. They said the river
level has risen dangerously after heavy rains in Sudan and
neighboring Ethiopia, whose rivers feed into the Nile.
   International aid has poured into Khartoum from Arab and West
European countries. But in Geneva, a senior U.N. official said a
lack of boats is hampering relief distribution.
   ``The problem is how to reach people,'' said Hybad Chowdhury,
senior officer at the U.N. Office of the Disaster Relief
Coordinator. ``Many have taken to high ground, on piles of rubble.
You can't commission a lot of boats like in southeast Asian
countries.''
   About 2,500 tents and 80,000 blankets have been airlifted to
Sudan, but more are needed, he said. Cash aid by the international
community so far totals $3 million.
   No disease outbreaks have been reported despite the dangers of
stagnant water, which cannot drain into Sudan's non-porous soil, he
said.
   In Geneva, the International Red Cross appealed today for more
international aid to Sudan.
   National societies and governments have contributed more than
100 tons of relief supplies, including 1 million water purification
tablets, the Red Cross said. Cash contributions through the Red
Cross totaled $840,000.

   The Duke and Duchess of York today left a hospital
with their newborn daughter, the Princess of York. As the proud
parents waved to hundreds of well-wishers, the newest member of
Britain's royal family slept.
   The baby, still unnamed, was swaddled in a white blanket for her
first public appearance, broadcast live on British television.
   Born Monday night weighing 6 pounds, 12 ounces, she is the first
child for Prince Andrew, the second oldest son of Queen Elizabeth
II, and his wife, Sarah. She is the queen's fifth grandchild and
fifth in line to the throne.
   The duke and duchess, both 28, waved to the crowd as they left
central London's Portland Hospital at 12:37 p.m. with the princess
for an undisclosed location.
   Before leaving, the duchess handed the baby to her husband, then
stumbled on the pavement as she accepted a bouquet of pink
carnations from an American tourist.
   ``I waved my flowers and she started to walk over,'' said Heidi
Alasio of Eugene, Ore. ``I'm very glad she didn't fall over all the
way. It was a very nice gesture that she came to get the flowers.''
   A palace spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
custom, said the duchess was feeling ``fine.''
   Andrew told reporters he hoped he would suffer ``only a few''
sleepless nights because of the baby. He is scheduled to return to
his Royal Naval duties in the Far East next week.
   Asked about his feelings for his daughter, he said: ``I am
overjoyed.''
   It's not unusual for royal parents to take several days to
select appropriate names for their babies. The names must be
approved by the queen who is currently vacationing in Scotland.
   British bookmakers and newspapers say likely choices include
Charlotte or Victoria, although Andrew was quoted as saying in May
that he favored Annabel.
   Before arriving at the hospital, Andrew attended a Post Office
ceremony to unveil a set of postage stamps based on his photographs
of famous castles.
   The stamps, ranging in value from 1 pound ($1.70) to 5 pounds
($8.50) are the first designed by a member of Britain's royal
family.
   They show Windsor, Edinburgh, Caernarfon and Carrickfergus
castles, one for each country of the United Kingdom. All have
strong royal connections.
   Andrew, an accomplished amateur photographer, thanked the Post
Office for ``having the guts'' to invite him to take the
photographs.

   Iran today denied it shelled Iraqi military
positions, and President Ali Khamenei urged his forces to remain
vigilant at the front.
   Also today, a British diplomat arrived in Tehran for talks about
British and other foreign hostages held by pro-Iranian groups in
Lebanon.
   Iraq on Thursday accused Iran of shelling Iraqi military
positions near the Shatt al-Arab waterway, where the Persian Gulf
war broke out in September 1980.
   But a spokesman for the War Information Headquarters in Tehran
denied the charge as ``false propaganda,'' the official Islamic
Republic News Agency said.
   The Iraqi charge came in a statement issued by the Iraqi Mission
at the United Nations in New York. It also came three days after
U.N. chief Javier Perez de Cuellar said Iran and Iraq agreed to
observe a formal cease-fire beginning Aug. 20 with direct peace
talks to begin five days later in Geneva.
   According to the statement, which was not carried in newscasts
in Iraq, ``the Iranian armed forces bombarded Iraqi military
positions'' with howitzer fire, mortar shells and small missiles.
The Iraqi statement reported no casualties, and there was no
independent confirmation of the attack.
   Earlier this week, Iran gave Perez de Cuellar a letter pledging
it would not launch any attacks before the cease-fire begins.
   Iraq did not submit a similar letter, but Perez de Cuellar has
said he received assurances from both Iran and Iraq that they would
exercise restraint.
   Khamenei, in a prayer sermon at Tehran University, today urged
his forces to remain at the war fronts for defense of Iran, Tehran
radio reported.
   A throng of worshipers chanted ``Down with the U.S.A!'' ``Down
with the Soviet Union!'' and ``Down With Israel!'' and pledged to
obey revolutionary patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   The crowd was noticeably smaller than during a similar sermon
attended by an Associated Press reporter four weeks earlier.
   IRNA said British diplomat David Reddaway arrived in Tehran and
planned talks on ``mutual relations'' during his stay in the
Iranian capital.
   It did not elaborate, but before leaving London Reddaway said he
would speak with officials about the 18 foreign hostages believed
held by pro-Iranian extremists in Lebanon. The hostage held longest
is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press. He was abducted March 16, 1985.
   Britain seeks the release of three of its nationals held by
pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalists _ Anglican envoy Terry Waite,
journalist John McCarthy and teacher Brian Keenan, a Belfast man
with dual British and Irish nationality whose release is also
sought by the Irish government. Britain says it also seeks word on
Alec Collett, a New York-based British journalist whose Palestinian
abductors claim they killed him. His body was never found.
   Iran has been making conciliatory statements about relations
with Western nations since it accepted on July 18 a U.N. call for a
cease-fire in the gulf war. Iraq accepted the resolution shortly
after it was passed in July 1987.
   A U.N. fact-finding team also arrived today in the Iranian
capital to investigate allegations of Iraq's renewed use of
chemical weapons, IRNA said.
   The Iranian news agency said the four-member team of chemical
weapons experts would travel to the northwestern Kurdish town of
Oshnaviyeh in the province of West Azerbaijan.
   Iran alleges that a chemical weapon attack on the town earlier
this month injured more than 2,000 civilians. U.N. reports have
confirmed Iraq's use of chemical weapons in the past.
   A U.N. observer group with 350 officers from 24 countries is to
monitor the planned cease-fire.

   Guards with truncheons searched handbags and
stood by the side of the screen when Martin Scorsese's
controversial film, ``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' was shown
for the first time in Montreal.
   But although 30 people protested peacefully outside the cinema,
there was no trouble inside and an invited audience had a mixed
reaction Thursday night.
   ``I found it very interesting and thought-provoking,'' said an
Anglican priest, Canon Garth Bulmer. ``I enjoyed it even though
much was far-fetched. It does make you think a lot about Jesus.''
   The movie was opening to the public today in Montreal and
Toronto.

<HEAD>Teachers Learn New Ways To Teach About Each Other's Country</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   American and Soviet educators are learning
new ways to teach students about each other's country by grappling
with such tough issues as the death penalty in an unusual program.
   But the educators are also discovering how common their worries
are.
   ``I am struck by how much we are all in the same boat,'' said
Alexander Mitrofanovich Bannov, the principal of a secondary school
in Novosibirsk. He is one of 40 teachers, administrators and
researchers at the two-week program at Hampshire College.
   Among the many problems the groups share, he said, were ``the
evaluation of teachers and students and staff, and the improving of
education. Everybody says teachers should teach better, as if a
child was a pan into which you could pour information like water.''
   The program was planned by the Academy of Pedagogical Sciences
in the Soviet Union and Educators for Social Responsibility, a
non-profit U.S. organization with 15,000 members, founded in 1981
to help educators teach students a sense of social responsibility.
   The purpose of the education summit is to share insights into
the ways each country teaches its children about the other and to
break through the propaganda for a better understanding of the two
nations.
   Lessons about each other's country ``are fraught with problems,
strong feelings, misinformation, deeply embedded assumptions and
resistance to new information, all related to tensions in
U.S.-Soviet relations,'' said Lawrence Dieringer, associate
director of Educators for Social Responsibility.
   The program opened Tuesday with frank talks about how each group
thought the other perceived it.
   The Soviets, for example, said they thought Americans saw them
as aggressors ``trying to take over the world,'' Dieringer said.
   ``We thought that they thought there was a great disparity
between the rich and poor in our country and that we don't care
about the poor,'' he said. ``In many cases there's some kernel of
truth in these stereotypes, but they are so exaggerated ... that
they serve to distort and limit our understanding of each other.''
   Also on the agenda is an examination of each country's
textbooks, a look at educational reforms in both countries and
strategies for teaching controversial issues using human rights as
case studies.
   Thursday, the groups learned ``believing exercises,'' a way of
suspending judgment to understand other viewpoints before looking
at them critically.
   They were asked to make statements supporting the position that
``there are some crimes so horrible and so abusive that they demand
capital punishment.''
   For many participants, it was impossible to suspend their doubts
about the death penalty enough to understand how others could
support it.
   ``This issue is so loaded for me that it comes up against my
strongest bias,'' said an American woman.
   A Soviet woman said she couldn't ``imagine this institution,''
although the Soviet Union, like many U.S. states, has a death
penalty.
   The idea for the gathering was laid out in a 1987 memorandum of
cooperation between the Academy and Dieringer's group, he said. The
list of cooperative ventures also included working together on
curriculum and exchanging articles that would be published,
unedited, in each organization's respective journals.
   A team of U.S. educators visited the Soviet Union for a week
last year to plan the program and a Soviet team came to the United
States in March for further planning. The next institute, on
critical thinking, will be held next summer in the Soviet Union.

<TEXT>
   A federal prosecutor said his office and the FBI
will investigate last weekend's riot at a lower Manhattan park to
determine whether police violated federal civil rights laws.
   As of Thursday night, 81 people had filed charges of police
brutality with a city police review board.
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani's office said in a statement
Thursday that it would conduct a preliminary review of the melee at
Tompkins Square Park to determine whether a formal investigation is
warranted.
   Fifty-two people were injured and seven were arrested during the
riot at the park late Saturday night and early Sunday morning. The
incident began with a protest against police enforcement of a 1
a.m. park curfew.
   Meanwhile, residents of the East Village area planned a park
cleanup, followed by a march, concert and rally protesting the
violence. The activities are expected to begin Saturday morning and
end around nightfall.
   Capt. Thomas Fahey, a police spokesman, said ``if there is not
an undue amount of people, the plan is to have nine or 10 seasoned
police officers enforce the noise laws and other laws inside the
park. If there's a lot of people, we're going to have to change our
plans.''
   Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward has criticized the initial
police response, saying it lacked adequate planning and that
tactical errors were made.
   However, a group representing 400 merchants sent a letter to
Ward defending the police, saying they ``do not countenance the
anti-social activities of drug addicts, vagrants and anarchists,
and we demand and expect strong police response to such
activities.''
   Ward asked four members of the review board to investigate the
brutality charges, as well as the management and planning of the
police at the scene.
   The police probe also will investigate allegations that some
officers covered their badges or took them off, in violation of
police policy.

<HEAD>Entertainer's Sister Tells of Efforts to Cremate Brother</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MACY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Liberace's 74-year-old sister sobbed as
she testified that the executor of her brother's estate talked of
his cremation even before his death.
   Angie Liberace, testifying in a lawsuit challenging her
brother's last will, said the subject came up in late January 1987
while Liberace was at Eisenhower Hospital in Palm Springs, Calif.
Liberace died Feb. 4, 1987 of complications of AIDS. She said the
entertainer's longtime attorney, Joel Strote, came to the hospital
and began discussing cremation of the entertainer at the time of
his death.
   ``He was discussing cremation before my brother even died,'' Ms.
Liberace testified. She said the subject was raised again later at
Liberace's Palm Springs home when the entertainer returned there to
die.
   ``I told him: `We're Catholics. I will never cremate my
brother,''' she said, beginning to cry.
   State District Judge Michael Wendell called a recess and the
subject was not discussed when her testimony resumed.
   Liberace was not cremated.
   Ms. Liberace said she did what she could to help the family
financially, and felt she should be compensated accordingly when
the famed pianist died.
   ``Our family went through Lee's money like gangbusters,'' she
said. ``There were a lot of expenses with my mother's health and my
brother, George, went through millions with all his wives.''
   George, who became well-known as Liberace's straight man during
his television series in the 1950s, died in 1983.
   Earlier, Ms. Liberace had testified that she was penniless while
a defense attorney countered she had been given more than $100,000
the past year from a $590,000 trust left by her brother.
   Ms. Liberace's two days of testimony came in a bitter court
battle between Strote, a Beverly Hills, Calif., lawyer who is
executor of Liberace's vast estate and five people challenging the
will signed 13 days before his death.
   In her second day of testimony Thursday, she criticized the
trust that was set up to take care of her. She said her brother had
intended for her to have everything she needed without having to be
accountable to anyone.
   ``If I didn't have this trust, I wouldn't have to answer to you
people for every piece of food I swallow,'' she testified.
``Liberace didn't intend for me to have a trust.''
   The sister is one of the plaintiffs in the case, along with
housekeepers Gladys Luckie and Dorothy McMahon, Liberace's longtime
manager, Seymour Heller, and the entertainer's companion of six
years, Cary James. The five contend Liberace was too ill to
understand more than 100 pages of documents when he signed a new
will and trust Jan. 22, 1987.
   Las Vegas attorney Richard Oshins, who prepared the will for
Strote, said the California attorney took steps to save the estate
money and consulted with Liberace before drafting the documents.
   Oshins noted that many of those in the will were given more in
the documents Strote drafted than in prior Liberace wills.

   Sein Lwin first rose to prominence in
Burma by commanding an army company that shot and killed 22
protesting students in a 1962 riot at Rangoon University.
   Last March, when thousands of students went on a rampage in some
of the worst rioting in Burma's history, it again was Sein Lwin who
led the forces that put them down.
   Analysts had suggested the 64-year-old hard-liner would be a
logical scapegoat as the government of Ne Win, his close ally,
sought to appease critics and stabilize the country.
   Instead, Sein Lwin emerged last month as Burma's most powerful
leader, succeeding Ne Win, who resigned.
   Protests against his authoritarian rule intensified this week,
and troops shot and killed at least 95 demonstrators.
   Today, Sein Lwin resigned as president and as chairman of the
chairman of the Burma Socialist Program Party _ virtually the
country's sole political institution.
   Sein Lwin joined the army in 1942 when Burmese officers,
including Ne Win, were siding with Japan against the Allies
-specifically Britain, which had colonized the onetime kingdom.
   As the war progressed, the officers switched allegiance to the
Allies, realizing Japan posed as much a threat to Burmese
independence as had the British. Independence from Britain in 1948
was followed by a chaotic, 14-year experiment with democracy.
   That experiment ended in 1962, the year Ne Win seized power in a
military coup and began to enforce his brand of economic socialism,
military-backed authoritarian rule and isolation from much of the
world.
   That same year, Sein Lwin led his army unit in quelling the
protest at Rangoon University, firmly establishing his reputation
as an unbending leader prepared to wield an iron fist to root out
opposition.
   Little has been pubished about Sein Lwin and others in Burma's
senior hierarchy, most of whom live secluded lives away from the
public eye.
   Sein Lwin retired from the army and in 1977 became a member of
the party's guiding body, the Central Executive Committee. He took
the No. 4 party slot of joint general secretary in 1985.
   Also in 1985, he was named secretary of the Council of State,
the No. 3 position in the government after president and vice
president. The 28-member council directs all state organs.
   He has also held ministerial portfolios for cooperatives,
transport, communications, and home affairs.
   On March 18, in a day that was later dubbed ``Bloody Friday,''
thousands of students stormed through downtown Rangoon, burning
cars and shouting anti- government slogans for the second time in
three months.
   The ``Lon Htein,'' or riot police, were called out, reinforced
by regular army units and armored vehicles. According to Western
diplomatic and Burmese sources, Sein Lwin commanded the police from
a tactical command headquarters at the government broadcast station.
   Sein Lwin overruled some leaders who wanted to handle the riot
more leniently, the sources said. The government has since admitted
to 43 deaths but more than 100 people are believed to have been
killed.
   Analysts, among them the respected Hong Kong-based Far Eastern
Economic Review, had suggested Sein Lwin would take the fall for
the violence, which deepened anti-government sentiments.
   Instead, after he became president, troops under his command
again fired on demonstrators.

   The United States and South Korea have
agreed in principle to move U.S. military installations from the
center of the capital to help ease anti-American sentiment,
government officials said today.
   Chief presidential spokesman Lee Soo-jung said senior officials
from both countries have been discussing the matter since President
Roh Tae-woo took office in February.
   Roh personally raised the issue when he met with Defense
Secretary Frank Carlucci and Secretary of State George Shultz in
Seoul in June and July, Lee said.
   ``The U.S. side agreed to consider the matter affirmatively, and
there have been a series of high and working-level talks between
the two countries,'' he said.
   A government source here, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said U.S. Ambassador James Lilley and Gen. Louis C. Menetrey,
commander of the U.S. Forces in South Korea, have been discussing
the matter with South Korean Foreign Minister Choi Kwang-soo and
Defense Minister Oh Ja-bok.
   The source said military facilities in the U.S. compound would
be relocated under long- and short-term programs, depending on the
sensitivity of military facilities involved.
   He said some facilities used for non-military purposes, such as
a golf course and a ball park, would be taken over by South Korea
``as soon as possible'' and converted into a public park.
   Although the two countries have no disagreement over the issue,
they still need to discuss details including moving costs that may
run into billions of dollars, a Foreign Ministry official said on
condition of anonymity.
   Many South Koreans have been demanding a relocation of the
military facilities, saing their location in the center of the city
blocks development.
   Anti-U.S. sentiment is high in South Korea among radical college
students who hold the United States resonsible for the partition of
the Korean Peninsula at the end of World War II in 1945. They
demand the withdrawal of all U.S. troops in South Korea.
   About 42,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea under a
mutual defense treaty signed in 1954. Their commanding headquarters
are in the center of Seoul.
   The military compound in Seoul, occupying 699 acres of land, is
the home of the headquarters of U.S. Forces, the 8th U.S. Army, the
Combined ROK (Republic of Korea)-U.S. Forces Command and the U.S.
Naval Headquarters in South Korea.
   Also inside the compound are housing for some U.S. diplomats and
military personnel, an army radio and television station and
military schools and commissaries.
   The number of military and civilian personnel living in the
compound is estimated at 6,000, according to U.S. military
officials here.
   South Korean correspondents based in Washington said the U.S.
government accepted the relocation on condition that South Korea
take up all costs. But South Korean officials maintain that the
United States should also bear a responsible portion of the cost,
the reports said.

   A $3.1 million, 40,000-pound scoreboard
at the new Charlotte Coliseum crashed to the floor today as it was
being lowered in preparation for tonight's inaugural basketball
games, but no one was injured.
   The accident came a day after the grand opening of the coliseum,
which the Rev. Billy Graham had blessed before a sell-out crowd.
   Three workers heard the 40-foot-wide scoreboard creak and groan
shortly before it collapsed, police Maj. J.J. Kelly said. Witnesses
said the scoreboard shattered on a wooden floor.
   There is a second floor under the floor that was hit, Kelly
said, adding that the games probably would be unaffected. The U.S.
women's Olympic team is scheduled to meet the Cuban national team,
and the U.S. men's team meets a team of NBA players.

   A high school student claims a teacher's
advice in auto shop class steered him in the wrong direction, and
he's been driven to file suit over a botched clutch job.
   David Price is suing the Corona-Norco Unified School District
for $250 in damages, claiming he received incorrect instruction on
how to replace his car's clutch last semester.
   ``I was allowed to leave school in a malfunctioning car and had
to pay for a full clutch job privately,'' said Price, who was a
junior when he took the class. ``I also had to buy parts per
teacher's instructions that were not necessary.''
   Trial on the small claims court case is set for Aug. 29.
   Price's father, Duane, said Thursday that his son tried
unsuccessfully to get the school district to reimburse him for the
cost of the parts and repairs. The Prices decided to sue because
school administrators were unresponsive, the elder Price said.
   Bob Crank, the school district's assistant superintendent of
business services, said he had received a copy of the lawsuit
Wednesday but had not had time to study it. It would be forwarded
to the district's attorneys, he said.
   He said he was unaware of any other complaints about the auto
shop program.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis said today that
overspending by the Reagan administration is to blame for
interest-rate increases that will raise the federal deficit $15
billion and impose hardships on families, farmers and businesses.
   The Democratic presidential nominee, speaking to a breakfast
gathering at the Virginia governor's mansion, said interest rates
would continue to rise ``if we continue to live on a credit card.''
   ``As we all know, sooner or later the bill collector comes to
the door,'' Dukakis said. ``That's what happened yesterday in the
United States of America.''
   He was referring to an increase in many banks' prime lending
rates.
   Dukakis has been criticized in Virginia because he opposes
construction of two new Navy supercarrier task forces which would
be built at the Newport News, Va., shipyard. Gov. Gerald L.
Baliles, who introduced Dukakis, said he disagreed with Dukakis on
that point but did not question his commitment to a strong national
defense.
   ``Gov. Dukakis and I may debate the individual choices we must
make, but in his commitment to the security of this nation I have
no doubts, no reservations and no hesitations,'' Balile said.
   Also today, Dukakis aides said his campaign would run a
one-minute advertisement this weekend in California and in the
Houston area. The ad, Dukakis' first since the primary campaign,
stresses his major themes, such as economic revival, and contains
footage from his acceptance speech at the Democratic National
Convention.
   Dukakis first blamed the administration for spurring the
increase in the prime lending rate in remarks he made Thursday
after touring Fort Dix in New Jersey.
   ``A 10 percent prime rate. It's 3{ in Japan,'' Dukakis said at a
rally in Hartford, Conn. ``Why? Because we haven't been able to pay
our bills for eight years in Washington, D.C.''
   Dukakis blamed the soaring federal deficit on Reagan's failure
to make ``tough choices'' on spending.
   ``We have to say no to a lot of things we'd like to say yes
to,'' Dukakis said. ``We've got to decide whether we want Star Wars
or star schools in this country.''
   ``I think it's regrettable,'' he said. ``I think it's what
happens after eight years of borrowing and spending, borrowing and
spending.''
   The Massachusetts governor spent most of Thursday trying to
establish himself as a tough leader on military and foreign policy
issues _ areas Republicans frequently cite as Dukakis' greatest
weaknesses.
   Dukakis toured Fort Dix, where he had eight weeks of basic
training after joining the Army in 1955. Earlier, he delivered a
speech in New York in which he said the country needed ``new
leadership in the White House'' prepared to carefully manage the
defense budget and negotiate further nuclear arms reductions with
the Soviet Union.
   ``Deterrence requires vigilance, and determination, and
leadership,'' Dukakis said. ``But it does not require the seemingly
endless development of new and more expensive nuclear weapons
systems, particularly when, thanks to President Reagan and
Secretary Gorbachev, we may have the best opportunity in our
lifetime to build a safer world.''
   Because of that progress, Dukakis said, a greater share of the
defense budget should be spent to improve conventional forces.
   ``We need strong, well-equipped, well-trained conventional
forces,'' Dukakis said after the tour of Fort Dix, where he met
with two men with whom he went through basic training.
   He also said the military should be prepared to help with
anti-terrorism and anti-drug operations.
   ``We have to build strong military forces in this country based
on sound planning and tough management, not wishful thinking and
blank checks,'' he said, criticizing expensive weapons systems
favored by Reagan and the current Pentagon procurement scandal.
   While in Connecticut, Dukakis attended two fund-raisers which
raised well in excess of $500,000 for the Democratic National
Committee's 1988 ``Victory Fund.''
   After a reception at the Virginia governor's mansion today,
Dukakis was headed to Jacksonville, Fla., where aides said he would
emphasize his commitment to anti-drug efforts and criticize the
Reagan administration for cutting Coast Guard funding and other
moves Dukakis contends have undermined the war on drugs.

   World health officials today approved
a strategy to promote better world health care by training doctors
to emphasize disease prevention and to pass this knowledge along to
their patients.
   ``We want doctors everywhere to concentrate on how to keep
people well, rather than always be thinking of new ways to cure
them when they fall ill,'' said Dr. George Miller of Clinton, N.Y.,
a former head of the Center for Educational Development at the
University of Illinois.
   The World Conference on Medical Education issued its declaration
at the close of the five-day conference today. The document sets
out principles to change and improve world health.
   ``Thousands suffer and die every day from diseases which are
preventable, curable or self-inflicted and millions have no ready
access to health care of any kind,'' said the declaration, which
was approved by 160 experts invited to the conference.
   ``The aim of medical education is to produce doctors who will
promote the health of all people _ not merely deliver curative
services to those who can afford it, or for those for whom it is
readily available,'' the declaration said.
   It set out steps for the radical reform of medical education
through cooperation with education and health ministries and
community health services.
   Dr. James Grant, executive director of the U.N. Children's Fund,
said it was now possible to improve dramatically the health of the
next generation.
   But he said parents were not being instructed on how to protect
their children at small cost from the ``great scourges'' of disease
including diarrhea, measles, tetanus, whooping cough and acute
respiratory infection.
   He said these diseases account for more than two-thirds of the
14 million child deaths in the world each year.
   Grant said ways must be found to give people the knowledge to
improve their own health.
   Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, newly appointed director-general of the
World Health Organization, told reporters that some countries had
too many doctors trained in curative medicine when the real need
was for disease prevention.
   The conference was told that Scots were turning to alternative
medicine and setting up self-help groups because of dissatisfaction
with doctors.
   ``They are doing this because they feel they are not getting
enough time or consideration or applied concern from their
doctors,'' said Linda Headland, secretary of the Scottish
Association of Local Health Councils, a liaison body of regional
health authorities.
   Mrs. Headland said women's self-help groups were set up in
Scotland to try to reduce dependence on tranquilizers, a problem
they blamed in part on doctors who prescribed the drugs over long
periods.
   ``People want more information about their treatment and they
want to be involved more in the decisions taken. They want to be
treated with a bit of dignity and respect,'' she said.
   Henry Walton, a psychiatrist, educator and president of the
Edinburgh-based World Federation for Medical Education which
organized the conference, said in an interview that too often,
doctors do not listen to their patients nor consider how to keep
them fit.
   ``They only think about them when they are ill. Medical
education must extend to take care of people in the community _ in
their homes and at work,'' Walton said.
   He said there is a serious problem in some countries of too many
doctors.
   ``Mexico, for example, has 1,500 unemployed doctors and a union
for unemployed doctors. They are taxi drivers, waiters ... Mexico
can't find the salaries to pay doctors whom they could well use,''
Walton said.

   Thunderstorms rumbled through the central United States today,
pounding Minnesota with hail the size of baseballs, while much of
the Southwest was drenched with lingering rainstorms trailing
tropical storm Beryl.
   Strong thunderstorms that formed along a stationary front
Thursday evening dumped the hail and brief heavy rains over
portions of North Dakota and central and western Minnesota. Many
windows were broken by the large hail at Marble, Minn. Hail the
size of golf balls hit Beach, N.D., and up to an inch fell at
Coleraine, Brainerd and Deep River, Minn.
   In northwest Minnesota, rainfall was heavy in some localities
such as Flom, which got half an inch in 15 minutes. An intense
thunderstorm at Ada, Minn., dumped over 1} inches.
   The remnants of Beryl brought thunderstorms and heavy rains to
parts of eastern Texas, eastern Oklahoma and western Arkansas. Rain
near Austin, Texas, ranged from 1 to 4{ inches.
   High winds from severe thunderstorms over western New York late
Thursday afternoon flipped over several docks and snapped a utility
pole in Chautauqua County. The thunderstorms moved to the northeast
part of the state by early today.
   Utah was hit by high winds Thursday afternoon, with gusts of up
to 70 mph reported in Garfield County.
   Thunderstorms over Arizona caused flooding in Tucson, where
nearly three-quarters of an inch of rain fell in little over half
an hour. Scattered thunderstorms continued this morning over
portions of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Florida, eastern Georgia
and lower Michigan.
   Hot temperatures remained over much of the nation Thursday.
Newark, N.J., recorded its 14th consecutive day of 90 degrees or
higher, the longest heat wave there since record keeping began in
1929.
   The high for the nation Thursday was 112 degrees at Bullhead
City, Ariz.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
due to the remnants of Beryl from the middle Mississippi and lower
Missouri valleys through much of Oklahoma and Arkansas into
northeast Texas and the northern half of Louisiana. Showers and
thunderstorms were also predicted for much of Mississippi and
Alabama, the central Gulf Coast, Florida, the Great Lakes region,
the northern Plains, northeast Colorado, southeast Wyoming and
across the Southern Plateau.
   High temperatures were forecast to be in the 80s or 90s across
much of the nation; in the 70s along the Pacific Coast; and 100-110
degrees from central Texas into the Rio Grande Valley and across
the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 53
degrees at Arcata, Calif., North Bend, Ore., and Flagstaff, Ariz.,
to 92 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz.

<TEXT>
   A mental hospital holding John W. Hinckley Jr.
today dropped its proposal to take the man who shot President
Reagan on a field trip, as prosecutors turned up new writings by
the presidential assailant.
   Dr. Raymond F. Patterson, director of St. Elizabeths Hospital's
forensic services unit, told a federal judge that the decision to
drop the request was based on material received by the hospital
Thursday night.
   Reading a letter to U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker,
Patterson said, ``The Forensic Services Administration has
determined that further clinical assessment by Mr. Hinckley's
treatment staff is necessary before it would permit him to
participate'' in a day-long field trip.
   Comments by attorneys on both sides during the brief hearing
indicated the material turned up by the Secret Service consisted of
letters by Hinckley to an unidentified third party.
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens asked Parker to unseal the
material, which he said the Secret Service had obtained through an
investigation. Defense lawyer Vincent Fuller described the material
as letters written by Hinckley.
   Parker refused to unseal the writings, which were turned over to
the court Thursday, until Fuller could respond to the government's
request they be made public. The defense lawyer was given until
Tuesday to file a written objection.
   Outside the U.S. Courthouse, Stephens told reporters the
writings should be made public because ``they relate to a matter of
great national importance, they relate to an individual who shot
the president of the United States.''
   ``The public should be aware of what these materials are,''
Stephens said.
   Stephens indicated that the material turned up by the Secret
Service were not known to St. Elizabeths officials until Thursday
night and was the basis for the hospital's decision to withdraw its
request.
   ``We provided materials to St. Elizabeths last night; they
withdrew their request for an off-site visit this morning,''
Stephens said.
   The hospital decision was announced a day after federal
prosecutors cited ``disturbing entries'' made this week in
Hinckley's psychiatric treatment record.
   Hinckley has been held at St. Elizabeths since he was acquitted
by reason of insanity of charges he shot and wounded Reagan,
presidential press secretary James S. Brady, and two other men on
March 30, 1981.
   Brady remains confined to a wheelchair as a result of crippling
injuries suffered during the shooting.
   The hospital had not formally made known its plans, but
officials at the facility had indicated they want to take Hinckley
on a supervised outing such as a picnic or a bowling party,
according to court records.
   Stephens said in Thursday's pleading that the latest treatment
entries support the government's demand to review letters and
writings seized from Hinckley's room in April 1987.
   The writings include correspondence with multiple murderer
Theodore Bundy, who is held on Florida's death row. Hospital
officials abruptly dropped their request to allow Hinckley to visit
his family over the Easter holiday last year after the Bundy
correspondence was disclosed.
   Parker, who presided at Hinckley's trial for the attempted
assassination of Reagan, ordered St. Elizabeths to let prosecutors
examine the treatment records that figured in its decision to
propose the field trip.
   But Parker has yet to rule on the government's request to see
those writings, which he placed under court seal last summer.
   In a pleading filed earlier this week, Hinckley's lawyers
opposed allowing the government to see the sealed material.
   ``As an insanity acquittee, Mr. Hinckley is receiving treatment
from the hospital with the ultimate goal of being rehabilitated,''
the lawyers said.
   ``For this treatment to succeed, Mr. Hinckley needs to have some
sense of privacy. The government wishes to invade that privacy
without any legitimate need to do so.''

   Sein Lwin resigned today as president
of Burma and from all his other major posts, state-owned Radio
Rangoon said, after thousands of people protested his 17-day rule
with violent demonstrations nationwide.
   Troops have killed at least 95 people in massive anti-government
protests since Sein Lwin became president on July 27, the radio
said. The People's Assembly elected him to replace Ne Win, who
resigned after 26 years in power.
   However, Western diplomats said the death toll may be in the
hundreds, and unconfirmed reports reaching Bangkok put the figure
as high as 1,000.
   The broadcast gave no reason for the resignation, and no
successor was immediately named. The radio said a special meeting
of both the central committee of the Burma Socialist Program Party
and the People's Assembly would meet next Friday.
   Earlier today, a Burmese guerrilla leader called on rebel groups
to launch a nationwide offensive against Sein Lwin's government.
   Soldiers in one town reportedly turned against the government
and allowed thousands of protesters to march through the streets.
   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Burmese security forces were trying to get rid of evidence of
civilian deaths by burning bodies.
   Radio Rangoon said the 92nd meeting of the party's central
committee today accepted Sein Lwin's resignation as the party
chairman, by far the most powerful political position in the
country.
   The report also said the Council of State accepted his
resignation as president of the republic and from membership of the
People's Assembly.
   Students initially led the anti-government demonstrations, which
also demand a return to democracy and economic reforms, but wide
sectors of the population later joined in the bloody street battles.
   Sein Lwin, 64, a former military officer, was held responsible
by demonstrators for brutal suppression of student demonstrations
in March and June as well as his predecessor's earlier crackdown on
dissidents.
   Demonstrators chanted slogans and carried placards through the
streets of Rangoon calling Sein Lwin ``a dog,'' ``a butcher'' and
``a Nazi.''
   But the radio said there were virtually no demonstrations in
Rangoon today. It said protesters also dispersed in the North
Okkalapa suburbs, where workers and others have battled troops in
recent days.
   But a Thai official speaking on condition of anonymity, said 200
soldiers and 100 policemen stayed inside while thousands of
demonstrators marched freely through Victoria Point in Burma's
southernmost province of Megui for a third straight day today.
Radio Rangoon denied that Victoria Point, a market town of about
5,000 people, had been taken over by protesters.
   Brang Seng, leader of a coalition of Burmese guerrilla groups,
called for an offensive ``from north to south'' to push the army
from dozens of towns and cities in Burma.
   A spokesman quoted the guerrilla leader as saying rebels would
attack government troops and calling on them to join in battling
the government. Rebels fighting for autonomy control vast areas of
the country.
   The spokesman, who refused to give his name, read the statement
over the telephone from Burma.
   Brang Seng is leader of the Kachin army, one of the ethnic-based
rebel groups in the National Democratic Front coalition. The
coalition claims to field about 35,000 rebel fighters. The nine
other rebel groups in the coalition could not be immediately
reached for comment.
   A senior Western diplomat in Burma, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Thursday that the actual death toll from the
rioting may be in the hundreds. He said solid information was
virtually impossible to get, partly because soldiers and protesters
were fighting a ``battle for the bodies.''
   ``When someone is killed, (the protesters) try to get it, so
they can display the bodies, and the government tries to get it to
cremate it'' so there would be no evidence of deaths, he said.
   He said the leadership, accustomed to undisputed rule, simply
does not know how to handle the disturbances and has assumed that
if enough force is applied, the demonstrators will simply go away.
   Protesters have turned more violent, responding to unprovoked
killings by security forces who shot into crowds to disperse them.
The protesters, mostly students, Buddhist monks and young people,
are getting ``100 percent support'' from the public, the diplomat
said.
   Prime Minister Tun Tin went on the radio Thursday to say that as
promised, the government will urgently carry out economic reforms
to boost living conditions. Reforms can't be implemented in the
current violence, he said.
   It was the government's first hint of concessions since Sein
Lwin assumed power in the impoverished nation of 38 million people.
Diplomats say economic problems, caused by Ne Win's isolationist
policies, are among the reasons for the uprising.
   With a per capita income of less than $200, Burma is one of the
world's poorest nations. Inflation is soaring and the country has a
foreign debt of $4 billion.

<TEXT>
   The Central Intelligence Agency,
apparently weary of the controversy and protests surrounding its
recruiting at the University of Colorado, has decided to move off
campus this year.
   In 1986 and earlier, CIA recruiting on the Boulder campus
resulted in demonstrations and arrests.
   Some students uninterested in CIA work waded through the pickets
anyway to talk to recruiters as a sort of counterprotest,
university placement director Gordon Gray said Thursday. Many with
sincere interest stayed away. For recruitment purposes, the entire
process was inefficient, he said.
   This year, the agency will accept individual applications and
interview potential employees elsewhere, Gray said.
   ``The process avoids big one-time, one-place confrontations,''
Gray said.

<HEAD>Suit Says Police Put Recorder in Victim's Casket</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police hoping to hear a murder
confession put a tape recorder near a woman's body as she lay in
her casket at a funeral home, according to a lawsuit filed by the
former suspect in the case.
   Michael Odom contends it was improper for police to put the
device in the casket of his girlfriend, Tracy Lynn Green, in March
1986.
   Odom ``had every right to expect complete privacy ... and did
not expect or even envision such an act by a public servant,'' says
the suit, filed Thursday.
   Police hoped Odom would confess to killing Ms. Green, 24, when
he paid his last respects, the suit says. Instead, the tape
captured comments that would have shown Odom's innocence, and
police then erased the recording, the suit contends.
   Police spokesman Chuck Johnson said the department would not
comment on pending litigation.
   Ms. Green died 11 days after she suffered severe head injuries.
Odom, 32, told police she had jumped from his moving van during an
argument, but police said she had been beaten to death.
   Odom was charged with first-degree murder in May 1986. He was
held without bond until February 1987, when the state attorney's
office dropped the charge.
   A medical examiner said Ms. Green could have fallen from the
van, and prosecutors said they did not have enough evidence to
bring Odom to trial.
   The lawsuit also says the investigation into Ms. Green's death
was tainted because a police detective made false statements in the
arrest affidavit and withheld evidence favorable to Odom.

<HEAD>Outlawed Tribal Group Agrees To End 10-year Insurgency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An outlawed tribal group today agreed to
end its 10-year-old campaign for an independent homeland in the
northeastern state of Tripura, a government official announced.
   The Tribal National Volunteers signed a memorandum of
understanding with federal and state governments, India's interior
minister, Buta Singh, said in Parliament.
   Under the agreement, worked out in three months of negotiations,
the insurgents agreed to surrender their weapons within a month and
abide by the Constitution. In return, the tribal group will be
given 20 seats in the new state legislature.
   The chief minister of Tripura, S. R. Majumder, said the accord
would bring peace and stability to the state, bordering Bangladesh.
Authorities estimate nearly 600 died during the insurgency.
   The problem started in 1951 with a steady influx of settlers
from Bangladesh and parts of India. The economic and social
patterns in the state shifted when the tribe members who originally
settled the area were outnumbered.
   In the 1970s, tribal unrest gave rise to the Tribal National
Volunteers, which declared ``Independent Tripura'' as its objective
and took up arms.
   The violence escalated, and in June 1980, nearly 400 people,
mostly non-tribals, were massacred.
   The group set up its underground headquarters in the Chittagong
Hill Tracts in southern Bangladesh and started training volunteers.
   In April 1983, the leader of the underground movement, Bijay
Hrangkhawl, rejected suggestions by then-Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi for a negotiated settlement between the organization and the
state government.
   In 1984, the organization was outlawed. But the violence
continued.
   In January, 97 people were killed. Non-tribals threatened
retaliation, and the Tribal National Volunteers vowed to disrupt
scheduled state elections, prompting the federal government to
deploy the army.
   The elections were held a month later despite the threats, and
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress Party wrested control of the
state from the Marxist Communist Party.
   In May, the Tribal National Volunteers said they were willing to
negotiate a settlement.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan's spokesman today denounced
House-passed legislation to withdraw all U.S. investment from
racially segregated South Africa, while supporter announced a
campaign to ensure its passage in the Senate.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the bill would
``destroy America's flexibility'' to seek change through diplomatic
pressure. ``Such moves are more likely to stymie progress toward
ending apartheid rather than to accelerate its end,'' Fitzwater
said.
   The House on Thursday adopted, on a 244-132 vote, the South
Africa sanctions bill, which also would impose a near-total trade
embargo. The bill faces threats of a Republican filibuster and a
Reagan veto.
   Supporters hailed the dramatic measure as a last-chance
opportunity to bring strong economic pressure to bear to help end
South Africa's apartheid system of racial separation by expanding
the less sweeping sanctions adopted in 1986.
   But Republicans said the bill represents a ``scorched earth''
policy that amounts to declaring economic war against South Africa,
a war they said would hurt the blacks it is designed to help by
causing millions to lose their jobs.
   ``Apartheid is a morally wrong and politically unacceptable
system which is the root cause of South Africa's disorder,''
Fitzwater said.
   ``However, the imposition of sanctions is not the solution,'' he
said. ``Sanctions would hurt the very people that we seek to help.
They would destroy America's flexibility, discard our diplomatic
leverage and deepen the crisis.''
   Groups supporting the bill told a news conference they still
lack the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto but believe
they could get it signed by Democrat Michael Dukakis if he is
elected.
   Robert Brauer, legal counsel to Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., said
proponents were meeting with key Senate aides today to discuss
strategy for the Sept. 8 debate of the sanctions bill in the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee.
   Damu Smith, executive director of the Washington Office on
Africa which has lobbied for an end to apartheid, said his
organization will intensify a grass-roots campaign against a
threatened Senate filibuster.
   GOP members called on the House to reverse course and adopt a
policy of ``black empowerment'' to increase the economic and
political power of blacks and weaken the foundations of the
apartheid system.
   But Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., and other sanctions supporters
said that course simply will not work.
   ``Black economic empowerment in the face of apartheid is an
impossibility,'' Wolpe said as the House voted down a trio of
Republican-sponsored amendments designed to dilute or change the
legislation.
   With the House and Senate eager to adjourn for the fall
elections, little time remains to push the bill through Congress,
especially since both houses likely would be faced with votes to
override a presidential veto.
   In a policy statement, the administration said Reagan's senior
advisers will recommend that he veto the sanctions bill if it
emerges from Congress in its present form because it ``undermines
the president's ability to conduct foreign policy.''
   It was likely that Senate opponents of the measure would launch
a filibuster, since there is no limit on discourse in that chamber.
Opponents have refused in the past to agree voluntarily to limit
discussion on such issues, forcing the chamber to a cloture vote to
shut off debate, a vote that requires the support of a two-thirds
majority.
   Many Republican opponents accused the House Democratic
leadership of staging a political vote to score points among black
voters for Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis and
for political activist Jesse Jackson on the eve of the Republican
National Convention.
   ``Some of us wonder if the real purpose of this bill is to be
responsive to the Jackson-Dukakis foreign policy,'' said Rep.
William Broomfield, R-Mich.
   ``We are not bringing this bill to embarrass Republicans,'' said
Rep. Ronald Dellums, D-Calif., principal sponsor of the measure.
``We are here to free black South Africa. This has nothing to do
with presidential politics.''
   Dellums said White House officials, citing ongoing peace
negotiations in southern Africa, had asked him repeatedly over the
last several days not to bring up the bill until after Congress
returns from its Labor Day recess.
   He said he agreed to do so, but only if Reagan promised in
writing not to veto the bill if it reached his desk.
   Dellums said that in the end, the White House declined to make
such a promise and he decided to go ahead.
   In an emotional summary that drew a standing ovation from his
colleagues, Dellums told the House:
   ``I listened to those who said this is going to hurt blacks,
it's going to hurt corporations. But human beings will struggle for
their freedom, in peace if they can, in violence if they must. ...
That pales every single argument you have made. We must end the
madness of apartheid.''
   The disinvestment legislation has its roots in the economic
sanctions voted by Congress in 1986 and still in effect. They
banned all new public and private loans and investments in South
Africa and barred certain imports and exports.
   The bill contains these major provisions:
   _All U.S. investment in South Africa would be banned and U.S.
corporations with such investments would be compelled to divest
them. The investment ban would not apply to any business in which
blacks or other non-whites have at least a 90 percent ownership
interest.
   _All South African imports to the United States would be banned
except for certain strategic minerals and publications. The 1986
sanctions law banned only agricultural products, coal, textiles,
uranium, and military vehicles.
   _All U.S. exports to South Africa would be prohibited with the
exception of agricultural products, publications and U.S. public
and private assistance.
   _The bill bars a U.S. company or vessel from transporting crude
or refined oil to South Africa. Americans also would be forbidden
to engage in the production of nuclear material in South Africa.

<TEXT>
   A time bomb planted by suspected Sikh
radicals exploded today on the roof of a state-owned bus, police
said, and at least seven people were killed and 35 injured.
   The bomb exploded late this afternoon, 20 minutes after the
vehicle left the crowded bus terminal at Chandigarh for the town of
Shazadpur in neighboring Haryana state, police chief Surinder Singh
Brar said.
   Almost at the same time, police detected and defused another
time bomb planted in Chandigarh's most popular shopping center,
Brar said. Both bombs are suspected to have been planted by Sikh
militants, he added.
   Chandigarh is the joint capital of Punjab and Haryana states. A
separatist campaign by Sikh insurgents in Punjab has killed 1,680
people this year.
   ``It was an encounter with death,'' said Yash Bir, a passenger
on the bus who suffered burn injuries in the explosion. ``I was
unconscious. I do not know who brought me to hospital.'' Bir spoke
to reporters from a bed in a Chandigarh hospital, where most of the
injured were taken.
   Doctors said five were in serious condition. The victims were
not immediately identified.
   Brar said the bomb was planted on the bus' rooftop luggage
carrier. About 70 passengers were in the vehicle when the bomb
exploded, he said.
   In other parts of Punjab, Sikh militants were blamed for five
other killings that occurred Thursday night and today, the United
News of India said.
   At least three victims were Sikhs, the news agency said. The
militants have targetted members of the Hindu community and
moderate Sikhs in their campaign.
   Sikhs form only 2 percent of India's 800 million people but form
a majority in Punjab. Radicals have been agitating for an
independent Sikh homeland since 1982, claiming discrimination by
Hindus, who form 80 percent of the population.

<TEXT>
   The 120-member crew of an
offshore vessel surrendered command of the ship after taking it
over early today in a labor dispute, a spokesman for the Dutch
seamen's union said.
   J.G. Harmsen said the incident, in which the Spanish crew of the
Dutch-owned Hermod seized command from Dutch officers for three
hours, ended peacefully after a misunderstanding about the weeklong
dispute was cleared up.
   Earlier today, the captain of the Hermod, which hauls heavy rig
equipment for the North Sea offshore oil industry, issued a
distress call requesting navy assistance because of the mutiny,
according to a Dutch Navy spokesman.
   ``Apparently there were some violent threats towards the
commanding officers,'' the spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Willem van Geneste
said. It was unclear whether the Dutch officers had been locked up
during the incident.
   Harmsen said the crew was on strike for a week when it seized
power today. He said that early in the day, the captain asked the
crew to suspend its strike and weigh anchor in light of worsening
weather conditions in the area where the vessel was operating, 100
miles northwest of this Dutch navy port.
   ``The crew failed to understand that the captain asked this
because of safety reasons,'' Harmsen told the AP. ``They thought it
was another company ploy.'' Harmsen said the leaders of the mutiny
abandoned their action after he explained the purpose of the
captain's request by ship-to-shore radio.
   ``The whole incident was based on a misunderstanding,'' Harmsen
said, adding that the strike had not been called off.
   The Hermod is owned by the Dutch offshore construction company
Heerema Engineering. Company spokeswoman Ria de Kok refused to
comment on the incident but said the request for navy assistance
had been withdrawn.
   The labor dispute on board the Hermod and several other vessels
involves Heerema's lay-off procedures. The majority of the
company's 950 Spanish sailors have short-term labor contracts and
are not protected by Dutch labor law.
   The sailors are demanding better conditions in dismissal cases,
according to Harmsen.

   Richard L. Thornburgh took the oath of office
today as the nation's 76th attorney general, declaring the United
States must consider drugs and drug-trafficking ``Public Enemy No.
1.''
   With President Reagan standing at his side in the Roosevelt Room
of the White House, Thornburgh said he would use ``every resource
of the Department of Justice, consistent with strict observance of
the civil rights and civil liberties of all our citizens, to fight
other unique threats to our traditional values.''
   But he said, ``I believe that unless we sustain a vigorous
effort to make drug trafficking and drug abuse Public Enemy No. 1,
we could well stunt significantly the capacity of today's young
people to contribute to a better quality of life for tomorrow's
America.''
   Shortly after his confirmation by the Senate Thursday,
Thornburgh said he was not counting on keeping the job if George
Bush becomes president.
   ``I look on this as a six-month assignment,'' Thornburgh said
after an 85-0 vote confirmed him as successor to the controversial
Edwin Meese III.
   The oath of office was administered to Thornburgh by Supreme
Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Bush attended the swearing-in
ceremony. Thornburgh's wife, Virginia, held the Bible while he said
the oath.
   The former GOP Pennsylvania governor said in a television
interview, aired in Philadelphia, that he'll ``let the future take
care of itself'' even if Vice President Bush is elected.
   Thornburgh, 56, already has told senators that he's a loyalist
to President Reagan, declaring last week, ``His agenda is my
agenda.''
   Last week, Thornburgh said that fighting the ``scourge of
narcotics'' would be his top priority, but he also promised a
vigorous battle against organized crime, public corruption and
white-collar crime.
   Thursday, he said ``every day'' of his potentially short tenure
``will be important, because the process of law enforcement is a
24-hour-a-day, seven-day a week, year-round proposition and I'm
anxious and enthusiastic about getting on the job.''
   Thornburgh likely will be able to concentrate solely on
department programs, unlike Meese, who spent considerable time
defending his personal conduct.
   Meese's ethical behavior was investigated by Independent Counsel
James McKay, who concluded that the attorney general ``probably''
broke the law. Meese consistently denied that, and maintained that
the department was running normally despite defections by top aides
during his final months as attorney general.
   Three other nominees for top Justice Department positions were
less fortunate Thursday than Thornburgh, as the Senate quit for the
summer without acting on them. Several senators used parliamentary
maneuvering to block action unless the Senate first took up
legislation to enforce a treaty against genocide. The genocide
legislation was not considered.
   The lack of action, however, is not likely to have a major
effect on department operations since all three already are serving
in acting capacities: Harold Christensen as deputy attorney
general; Francis A. Keating II as associate attorney general; and
Edward S.G. Dennis Jr. as chief of the criminal division.
   ``We almost worked out something, but at the last moment we were
unsuccessful,'' said Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, R-Kan. The
Senate likely will vote on the three in September.
   Thornburgh was supported enthusiastically by Meese's sharpest
critics. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., attempted to paint a
contrast between the two men.
   He said Meese attempted ``to roll back decades of progress in
civil rights,'' gave ``favored treatment to friends'' and
``tarnished his high office.''
   Thornburgh, he said, ``will be an attorney general of a
different and better mold. ... He will do as much as he can to
repair the damage and injustices of the Meese regime.''
   Kennedy said he admired Thornburgh's work as director of the
Institute of Politics at the John F. Kennedy School of Government
at Harvard University. The institute is named after the senator's
brother.
   ``Clearly, we have a superior nominee here,'' Sen. Paul Simon,
D-Ill., said of Thornburgh.
   The attacks on Meese were lacking when Republicans spoke, but
the praise for Thornburgh was bipartisan.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C. said Thornburgh has demonstrated the
characteristics needed for the job: ``character, integrity, good
judgment, competence and independence.''
   Thornburgh ran the Justice Department's criminal division during
the Ford administration, and established the public integrity
section that prosecutes corrupt public officials.

   Authorities stormed a house occupied by
squatters Friday, arresting 67 people and seizing a bazooka and
other weapons, police said. They said two officers were wounded.
   The arrests occurred after six policemen were injured Thursday
in a raid on a neighboring house occupied by squatters. The
squatters fled into an adjacent property, and police obtained a
court order to search that house Friday.
   An earthmover was used to smash one wall after the squatters
refused to leave. Police then entered the building and made the
arrests. Reporters saw police dragging at least one person who was
unconscious from the house.
   Police said they seized a bazooka, two pistols, bullets, knives
and chains. The house seized by police Thursday was largely
demolished during the night. Both properties are to be torn down
for a small park.

   The largest ever American food promotion and sales
exhibition in Japan will be held in Tokyo from Aug. 30-Sept. 1, the
U.S. Embassy said Friday.
   More than 90 participants will show about 1,000 items of 500
kinds in the exhibition, called the ``U.S. Food Shop '88,'' the
embassy's Agriculture Trade Office said.
   It said the new participants and increased size reflects more
liberal Japanese agricultural trade policies.
   Exhibits will include meat and poultry, seafood, confectionery,
dairy, beverages, nuts and grains, fresh fruits and vegetables,
canned and frozen food, and seasonings and spices.
   The first such exhibition was held in Japan in 1968.
   The United States exported $57 million in agricultural products
to Japan last year, up 11 percent over 1986.

   Wholesale price inflation increased to an
annual rate of 5.7 percent in July, spurred by big boosts over a
wide variety of products, including clothing, automobiles,
furniture and poultry, the government said today.
   The increase came despite lower prices for beef, as the drought
prompted farmers to slaughter more animals because of burned-out
pastures and higher feed prices.
   Just three days after the Federal Reserve Board initiated an
increase in interest rates to fight inflation, the Labor Department
said wholesale prices rose 0.5 percent in July, the same monthly
increases as in May and March.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We would
rather not see any increase in producer prices, but we still
believe inflation remains low and under control.''
   In June, the department's Producer Price Index for finished
goods rose 0.4 percent, or at an annual rate of 4.6 percent, more
than double the 2.2 percent rate of wholesale price inflation for
all of 1987.
   Wholesale prices for consumer foods increased at a slower pace
in July _ 0.4 percent _ than for goods overall, indicating to some
analysts that the worst immediate effects of the drought plaguing
the farm belt were over. Food prices had been rising faster than
prices for other products on the wholesale level since April.
   Overall energy prices, meanwhile, remained unchanged after a 1.6
percent drop in June, with a 3 percent seasonally adjusted increase
in gasoline prices offsetting a 6.1 percent decline in what
distributors pay for home heating oil.
   Excluding food and energy, wholesale prices rose at 0.6 percent
in July. Because food and energy prices are highly volatile from
month to month, most analysts look to price changes for other
products as a better indication of underlying inflation.
   Analysts said the softer food prices partly offset what they
called an over-reaction in June to the drought.
   ``As expected, higher feed prices and burned-out pastures have
sharply increased market slaughters and begun to influence meat
prices,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting
at Georgia State University. In addition, Ratajczak said, fruit
trees under stress from the unusually hot weather are throwing off
their fruit early ``resulting in a temporary early supply of
fruit.''
   Wholesale prices in July fell 2.5 percent for beef, 10.5 percent
for pork and 0.2 percent for soft drinks. They rose 2.3 percent for
fruit, compared with a 6.7 percent increase in June, 7.5 percent
for vegetables, 13.3 percent for bakery products, 2 percent for
chickens and 20.3 percent for processed turkeys.
   Rataczak predicted that meat prices will rise sharply in 1989 as
a result of the early slaughters and fruit prices will spiral
upwards this fall because of less than the usual supply then.
   Price increases were widespread across a wide variety of
non-food items. Men's clothing rose 0.9 percent, drugs were up 1.1
percent, cosmetics increased 1.7 percent and auto prices edged up
0.5 percent after a 1 percent decrease in June.
   The only non-food, non-energy consumer items for which wholesale
prices fell last month were glassware, down 2.3 percent, and
household flatware, down 0.4 percent.
   The July increase in finished goods overall put the Labor
Department's index at 108.5. That means a variety of goods costing
$100 at the wholesale level in 1982 cost $108.50 last month,
compared with $107.90 in June and $106.00 a year ago.
   Wholesale prices for intermediate goods used in production rose
0.7 percent in July, indicating more inflation lies ahead despite
the Federal Reserve Board's decision Tuesday to boost the rate it
charges banks for credit from 6 percent to 6.5 percent.
   Prices for intermediate goods, or those used in processing, had
risen 0.9 percent in June. Analysts said the smaller July increase
was due almost entirely to a decline in oil prices before before
OPEC members Iran and Iraq agreed late in the monthy to a
cease-fire.
   Excluding food and energy, prices for intermediate goods such as
industrial chemicals, finished steel products, paper and synthetic
fibers rose 0.7 percent overall.
   However, raw material prices fell 1.1 percent, with crude oil
prices plummeting 9.3 percent. Corn prices soared 20 percent on the
drought, but the increase was smaller than in June. Raw iron and
steel prices jumpted 12 percent after holding fairly steady for
three months.
   Price changes on the retail level usually lag one to three
months behind those at wholesale. Consumer price inflation has been
averaging 4.4 percent for the past 18 months. July figures on
consumer prices are to be published Aug. 23.

   Five Vietnamese who fled to Hong Kong by boat
left the British colony voluntarily for home Friday, the government
reported.
   About 23,000 boat people remain in Hong Kong camps, including
about 90 others who have asked to be sent back to the communist
nation, about 500 miles to the south.
   The Vietnamese who arrived before June 16 are viewed as
political refugees eligible for resettlement in third countries.
   But under a new policy to curb the surging number of arrivals,
the about 7,000 boat people who arrived since mid-June are
classified as illegal immigrants subject to repatriation unless
they can prove political persecution.
   Vietnam said it will accept people who volunteer to return.
   The five repatriated Vietnamese men arrived in the same boat in
December. No reason was given for their decision to return.

<HEAD>Meese Signs Order For Independent Counsels to Investigate Congress
Members</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III ended his
controversial tenure at the Justice Department today by signing an
order that provides for independent counsels to investigate members
of Congress.
   Meese, who has been investigated by two separate independent
counsels since he came to Washington in 1981, said his final act as
attorney general will ensure that members of the legislative branch
and top executive branch officials are treated in the same manner
during federal criminal investigations. However, Meese's order
established some differences.
   ``As many of you know, many people have long felt that there was
an undesirable disparity between the way that members of the
executive branch and members of the legislative branch were treated
when it comes to allegations of criminal wrongdoing,'' Meese said
at his final press conference.
   Under the order, if the attorney general receives specific and
credible mation indicating that a senator or congressman has
violated criminal law, he must launch a preliminary investigation
of up to 90 days to see whether a special counsel should be named
to conduct a full probe.
   Based on the results of the preliminary probe, the attorney
general can either close the case or appoint a special independent
counsel to investigate.
   Meese said members of Congress will be treated similarly to top
executive branch officials under the provisions of the Ethics in
Government Act passed in 1978.
   In fact, the procedures will differ. For instance, Meese's order
retained for future attorneys general the power to select any
independent counsel to investigate members of Congress. But the
ethics act invests that appointment power in a special three-judge
panel in cases involving top executive officials.
   Earlier in the administration, Meese sought to have the act
declared unconstitutional, but the Supreme Court upheld it on June
29. Meese argued that the law infringed on the president's power
and resulted in unequal administration of justice because normal
criminal cases were handled by the Justice Department.
   Even before the act was passed in 1978, the Justice Department
had authority to hire special counsels to replace government
attorneys in any case where the attorney general perceived a
conflict for the government lawyers. This was done in the Watergate
scandal.
   But as a result of Meese's order, ``the attorney general is
required under this code of federal regulations to follow these
procedures'' with respect to members of Congress, according to a
Justice Department official who did not want his name used.
   Meese said he had discussed the order with his successor, former
Pennsylvania Gov. Richard L. Thornburgh, though not with anyone on
Capitol Hill. Thornburgh could rescind the order if he chose to.
   Lawmakers who have dealt with the independent counsel law have
said they believe the act already applied to members of Congress.
Among those with this view are Reps. Peter W. Rodino Jr., D-N.J.,
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and Barney Frank,
D-Mass., chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee that reviews the
law.
   They quote the act as saying the attorney general may trigger an
inquiry to determine whether an independent counsel should be
appointed if he ``determines that an investigation or prosecution
of the person...by the attorney general or other officer of the
Department of Justice may result in a personal, financial, or
political conflict of interest.''
   Meese said the ethics in government law permitted him to sign
the rule applying coverage to Congress, but he waited until
Thornburgh had been confirmed to shield him from any problems.
   Meese said he had no idea why Congress did not spell out that
the law should cover its own members. But Meese said his order will
not apply to investigations that are currently under way.
   Meese is leaving the Justice Department to serve as a fellow at
the conservative Heritage Foundation, a think tank, and the Hoover
Institute at Stanford University. He also intends to hit the
lecture circuit.
   While at the White House, Meese was investigated by independent
counsel Jacob Stein on allegations that he may have used his office
for personal gain. Stein brought no charges against Meese.
   More recently, independent counsel James McKay investigated
Meese on allegations of conflict of interest and looked into his
relationship with E. Robert Wallach, a lawyer who has been indicted
in the Wedtech case. Wedtech is a defense contractor in the Bronx,
New York.
   McKay said last month that prosecution of Meese was unwarranted,
although the attorney general probably violated tax and
conflict-of-interest laws.
   Meese harshly criticized McKay's comments and said the special
counsel's report vindicated him.
   At his news conference, Meese said neither he nor anyone at the
White House would have helped Wedtech secure government contracts
if they had known Wedtech was a ``nest of criminals.''
   ``I would not have had anything to do with it,'' he said.

   The U.S. Postal Service has done what
Revolutionary War-era carpenters could not _ rebuild Trinity Church
by July 26, 1788.
   The historic church on Wall Street in lower Manhattan burned
down in 1776. Construction on the second Trinity began in August
1788. But on stamps issued July 27 in New York City, the church's
spire stands tall above the date July 26, 1788 _ when the building
remained in ruins.
   ``The Postal Service has an obligation to posterity to depict
the facts as they are,'' complained historian John Tauranac in a
letter to Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank.
   ``As the stamp now exists, it will go far in miseducating the
public, which is a grave disservice _ one might even say, an
engraved disservice,'' Tauranac wrote.
   His letter failed to move postal officials, who issued the stamp
to mark the anniversary of New York's ratification of the U.S.
Constitution _ an event which actually took place in Poughkeepsie
anyway.
   Jack Williams of the post office's stamp division said the
25-cent stamp is supposed to be ``reminiscent of an era'' rather
than representative of the city on a specific date.

   Jesse Jackson won an extension today of a
temporary court order barring a businessman from selling or
distributing videotapes of Jackson's speech to the Democratic
National Convention.
   U.S. District Judge James B. Zagel extended the temporary order
until Tuesday when he said he planned to issue a written opinion on
Jackson's lawsuit seeking to permanently bar MPI Home Video from
selling or distributing the videotape.
   ``I'm pleased with the result,'' said Henry Mason, one of
Jackson's attorneys. But Mason said he expected the lawsuit would
be heard in a trial unless the two sides reach some type of
settlement.
   Waleed B. Ali, the suburban businessman who sold the videotapes
of the former presidential contender's convention speech, testified
Thursday that he was motivated by money and the event's historic
importance.
   ``I thought we had a hot-seller,'' Ali said.
   Ali, president of MPI Home Video in suburban Oak Forest,
acknowledged during the hearing that he had never obtained
permission to sell the tapes from the former presidential candidate.
   But attorneys for MPI contend the company didn't need Jackson's
authorization because his hourlong speech July 19 in Atlanta was a
news event, unprotected by federal copyright law.
   Ali's attorneys have argued that MPI legitimately purchased
ABC-TV's coverage of the speech from the network for $6,500.
   Ali said that while viewing the speech live on ABC-TV, he knew
it was newsworthy and worth preserving for historic reasons.
   ``Our position is that it is news,'' Ali testified.
   ``You admit that Reverend Jackson never authorized you to make
this tape?'' asked Jackson's attorney, William Conlon.
   ``Absolutely,'' Ali testified. ``I don't have any arrangement
with the Rev. Jackson.''
   The 60-minute tape, ``Jesse Jackson: We Can Dream Again,'' is
comprised of uncut ABC coverage, including commercials and camera
shots of the convention floor, Ali said.
   Ali said that until a July 29 temporary restraining order barred
the sale and distribution of the tape until today, his firm had
shipped about 7,100 cassettes, at a list price of $14.95 each.
   Jackson, who did not appear in court Thursday, testified last
week that MPI's tape ``has hurt our ability to make a living off my
work.''
   He said he reaped $100,000 four years ago from marketing a
videotape of his speech to the 1984 Democratic National Convention,
and that MPI's distribution of this year's speech has cut into its
market potential.

   Republican platform writers wrangled over
U.S. policy in Southern Africa today as they strived to wrap up
their pre-convention work on a document that highlights George
Bush's experience.
   The 106-member platform committee looked for ways to avoid a
divisive fight over deployment of the Star Wars anti-missile system
after finishing with the domestic portion of the 30,000-word
document Thursday.
   But it was Southern Africa that sparked an early fight between
more militant committee members and those pushing the views of the
Bush campaign.
   First the committee agreed to denounce South Africa:
``Republicans deplore the apartheid system of South Africa and
consider it morally repugnant.''
   But then the committee turned back a series of amendments
designed to blame communists for many of the problems in that
troubled region.
   For example, Jim Summers of Washington wanted to specify that
all Communist troops should leave Angola, rather than all foreign
troops, the phrase pushed by the Bush forces.
   ``If it looks like a Red and talks like a Red ... let's call it
a Communist,'' he said.
   But Rep. Tom Loeffler of Texas, head of the foreign policy
subcommittee, argued against any changes: ``Words are delicate.
Written comments cannot be retracted.''
   Summers' proposal was rejected as was language offered to
condemn the African National Congress, a key group fighting the
South African government.
   ``It's a communist group,'' said Angela ``Bay'' Buchanan of
California, the amendment's sponsor.
   Loeffler said he agreed with the sentiments, but said any change
``can cause problem with respect to the situation in South Africa.''
   The Bush forces did accept an amendment opposing ``the
maintenance of communist forces in Mozambique.''
   Today's session, focused on the 60 pages of defense and foreign
policy language, began with praise for Republican nominee-to-be
Bush and criticism of Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis.
   ``There is one person who can fill the full measure of the
awesome charge of being president _ George Bush,'' said Rep. Tom
Loeffler of Texas. ``The grim truth is, Mr. Dukakis, that the Oval
Office is no place for on-the-job training.''
   The Oval Office phrase is in the platform itself.
   Foreign policy is an area that Bush views as a strength in his
battle against Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts.
   Rep. BIll McCollum of Florida denounced as ``pure political
hogwash'' rhetoric from Dukakis and running mate Lloyd Bentsen that
Bush has not been deeply involved in foreign policy.
   ``We have a candidate who has been more involved in foreign
policy ... than anyone who has ever run for president of the United
States,'' McCollum said.
   There was a bitter tangle on AIDS on Thursday, but the committee
members, while dissenting on a variety of issues, chose not to
disturb Bush's hopes for a peaceful convention with floor fights on
the platform.
   ``I doubt very much that there will be any floor fights,'' said
Sen. Robert Kasten of Wisconsin, co-chairman of committee. ``The
moderates in our party have had a significant impact on the newer
issues in the platform.''
   Earlier today, GOP Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf, interviewed on
``CBS This Morning,'' said, ``We're a conservative political party.
We're proud of that. We're not afraid of the `c' word.''
   Fahrenkopf said, however, the document will reflect Bush's plans
for ``a new direction in education, in environment, in child care.''
   ``The vice president came here in an unprecedented event and
spoke to this platform committee and tried to give them that
direction, so that this really will truly be a Bush platform,'' he
said.
   The GOP platform committee will meet again Monday afternoon,
after the opening session of the convention, to take a final vote
before the convention faces the issues on Tuesday.
   One possible fight today looms over when to deploy President
Reagan's Star Wars plan, formally called the Strategic Defense
Initiative.
   Strong Star Wars backers, led by Angela Buchanan of California,
pushed through a change earlier this week to make the platform call
for ``rapid and certain deployment'' of SDI.
   But former Sen. John Tower of Texas, a Bush spokesman on
defense, told reporters that the platform would reflect the
original draft language, calling for deployment as soon as feasible.
   ``I don't think we should begin the program by acting too
precipitously,'' he said.
   Ms. Buchanan vowed a fight at the committee against any changes.
   ``My understanding is that the vice president is comfortable
with the language,'' she said.
   Most of Thursday's session was peaceful, in sharp contrast to
the heated debates earlier in the week on such topics as abortion.
   Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut dropped his plans to
press an amendment calling upon the GOP to back tough economic
sanctions against South Africa. And a possibe floor fight was
averted over abortion when moderates dropped plans to challenge a
plank that says, ``We believe the unborn child has a fundamental
individual right to life which cannot be infringed.''

   Israel's pre-election debate on the future of
the occupied territories is turning into a battle of the generals.
   The liberal Labor Party of Foreign Minister Shimon Peres is
reassessing policy based on the recommendations of retired military
chiefs who believe giving back land may not jeopardize the nation's
security.
   But their positions are disputed by ex-generals aligned with the
right-wing Likud bloc of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. They argue
that a smaller Israel is a more vulnerable Israel.
   ``Could we leave Judea and Samaria (the West Bank) and be safe?
The answer is no,'' said retired Maj. Gen. Yehoshua Saguy, a Likud
candidate for Parliament.
   The Nov. 1 elections may turn on whether Israeli voters are
willing to risk giving up all or part of the 2,266 square miles of
West Bank and Gaza Strip captured in the 1967 Middle East War.
   Much of the new thinking about the territories is coming from
the liberal, Labor-oriented Council for Peace and Security, which
includes among its members 30 major generals, 80 brigadier generals
and 100 colonels.
   Spokesman Moshe Amirav says after four months of internal
debates, the private think tank is getting ready to publish a
series of papers on the military implications of giving up
territory.
   Amirav said participants reached a consensus on four major
points:
   _ Evacuated areas would become demilitarized, except possibly
for some troops along the Jordan River.
   _ The Jordan River would be the military frontier.
   _ Israel's air force would control of the skies over any
territory yielded to the Arabs.
   _ Israel would maintain early warning stations in the West Bank,
perhaps existing bases, on 50-year leases.
   Retired Maj. Gen. Menachem Meron of the peace council said it
could take years to establish adequate security safeguards.
   ``Our group believes territorial compromise can be achieved and
defense arrangements can be made, even if they cover a long period
of time,'' he said in an interview.
   The daily Yediot Ahronot newspaper said a withdrawal plan was
being drafted for the Labor Party by a group of senior reserve
officers headed by Avigdor Ben-Gal, a retired major general and
leading figure in the peace council.
   It would replace a Labor Party policy paper that envisioned
Israel holding onto the Jordan Valley and other strategic areas of
the West Bank for security reasons.
   ``Under the previous plan, Israel would keep 50 to 60 percent of
the territory. But in terms of security, we say it can give up to
100 percent if these conditions are met,'' Amirav said.
   He said the council has reached a consensus that a Palestinian
state ``is not by itself a mortal threat to Israel,'' although this
has become a slogan of the right.
   Saguy, who has emerged as a leading Likud spokesman on defense
policy, said Israel's defense strategy is built on its ability to
mobilize reserve troops and the ooccupied land is needed to buy
time for troops to get into position.
   He said maintaining the Jordan River as a defensive line allows
Israel to send troops to the frontier without being subject to
attack in hostile areas of the West Bank in between.
   Some pro-withdrawal generals said accurate long-range missiles
make it unnecessary to hold onto the territory as a buffer. But
Saguy said the extra time provided by territorial depth is more
critical than ever.
   Alouph Hareven, a former intelligence colonel and leading figure
in the peace council, said former generals will play a key role in
selling the public on the need to get rid of the occupied lands.
   ``The Israeli public is not sentimentally attached to Nablus,
Hebron or other areas of the West Bank. What matters to them is the
security dimension,'' he said.
   Saguy, a former head of military intelligence, agreed voters
would decide on the basis of security issues. But he said, ``Nobody
sees an alternative to holding the territory right now.''
   Raphael ``Raful'' Eitan, a former chief of staff and now a
leading figure in the nationalist Tehiya Party, said Israel should
annex all occupied land.
   ``We must annex all of (the territory) and massively settle
every spare corner of the Land of Israel,'' Eitan, a legislator,
said on Israel radio.
   Saguy was forced to resign and Eitan retired after a judicial
commission criticized them for failing to prevent the massacre of
Palestinians by Christian militiamen in the Beirut camps of Sabra
and Chatilla in 1982.

   The leaders are Harvard Law graduates who could be
earning more than $100,000 a year. The participants are high school
and college students who could be at the beach. Instead, they're
working as a sort of urban Peace Corps that organizers hope will
set a national example.
   The program, called City Year, is a privately funded community
service project. Fifty students ages 18 to 21, from high school
dropouts to Brown University students, were culled from 150
applicants.
   They begin their days at 8 a.m. sharp on Boston Common with 20
minutes of calisthenics. If they're late, they do extra exercises.
They spend the rest of the day on various projects, battling the
summer's searing heat and humidity as well as urban blight.
   One day they sort surplus food in a warehouse, other days they
help paint and renovate shelters for the homeless, clear brush from
vacant lots or work with disabled children.
   ``We call it City Year, because we thought of it as being like
junior year, senior year, then City Year,'' said Michael Brown, 27,
a recent Harvard Law School graduate who is one of the group's
directors. ``We say, `Why not spend a city year helping your city
before going on to college?'''
   City Year ends this summer but organizers hope to get enough
funding to make the program year-round. They plan to start it up
again next year.
   Raquel Mello, 17, said she's ``learned a lot about other
people.'' She said she enjoyed working on a project with disabled
children so much that she found it ``painful to leave.''
   Though youth corps exist in other cities, City Year President
Alan Khazei said most of them are government-funded. Khazei began
working on the program during his last year at Harvard Law with two
other students and a fourth person from another college. They took
their idea around to Boston's business community in the hope of
receiving funding and were rewarded.
   Bain & Company, Bank of Boston, Equitable Financial Services and
General Cinema each donated $25,000 to fund four of the five
10-person City Year teams. Citizen contributions funded the fifth
team.
   ``One of the big issues with national service is how do you fund
it?'' said Khazei. ``Well, we've reached out to the private sector
to show it can be done.''
   Khazei said he and his colleagues prefer working to ``promote
the idea of national service'' rather than taking high-paying
corporate jobs.
   ``This is a lot more fun,'' he said. ``We love what we're doing.
I can't think of anything more rewarding than working with
wonderful young people.''
   Kristen Hollister, 27, a Brown graduate, is one of the
individual team leaders. Because she knows sign language, the two
hearing-impaired participants were assigned to her team.
   ``When I read the (program) proposal, I said, `This is it, this
is what I have to do to make a difference,''' she said.
   Hollister said the highlight of her team's work came on a recent
sweltering day at a shelter for the homeless. The students spent
the day on the third floor of the shelter reupholstering chairs for
the women in the shelter.
   ``Each of them got to carry a chair down to the women at the end
of the day,'' said Hollister. ``When the women saw the chairs, they
all cheered. It was such a high.''
   A stint spent working at the Massachusetts Hospital School for
disabled children was the high point for many of the students.
   Winda Maldonado, 17, who is deaf, said it was a revelation to
her to care for children with greater disabilities than herself.
   ``It was my favorite place,'' she said. ``I loved it. I din't
want to leave. I made so many friends.''
   Caleb Jacobson-Sive, 17, a prep school student, said that prior
to City Year, he ``might have avoided people like the ones there.
But I look at handicapped people totally differently now. This
(City Year) has changed my outlook on a lot of things.''

<HEAD>East Germany Praises Role of Berlin Wall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist East Germany on Friday hailed the
``positive effects'' of the Berlin Wall, where 77 people have been
killed in attempted escapes to the West since it was erected in
1961.
   On the eve of the wall's 27th anniversary, the official
Communist Party newspaper published a lengthy article repeating
long-standing allegations that the 13-foot barrier had blocked a
planned attack from the West.
   Under a headline reading ``For peace, for socialism,'' the Neues
Deutschland newspaper recalled the start of the wall's construction
on Aug. 13, 1961. ``From then on, positive effects have continued
up until today and will continue in the future,'' it said.
   ``The summer Sunday 27 years ago stands in close relation to the
struggle for the maintentance and strengthening of peace, security
and cooperation on our continent,'' the newspaper added.
   East German border guards hastily began erecting the wall
through downtown Berlin, dividing the city East and West when the
flow of refugees to West Germany became so great it threatened to
cripple the communist nation's economy.
   Today, armed East German guards with shoot-to-kill orders patrol
the wall around the clock. Floodlights illuminate it at night.
   Neues Deutschland said that in 1961, ``the Western powers used
hysteria and an open threat of military force as the answer to the
proposals of the Soviet Union and other Socialist countries for the
assurance of peace and the resolution of the anomalous situation in
Berlin-West.''
   The paper said there were plans at the time for a ``forcible
change of the status quo.''
   ``The attack was tried out in a series of NATO maneuevers, and
troop readiness areas were drawn up,'' the paper said.
   The August 13th Working Group, a West Berlin organization that
monitors human rights in East Germany, says the number of people
who have been killed in escape attempts is 77.
   The last reported death came on May 23, 1987, when a lifeless
body was carried away from the wall on the East Berlin side.
   Rainer Hildebrandt, the head of the August 13th group, told a
news conference on Friday: ``The shoot-to-kill orders are still in
effect at the Berlin Wall and on the boundary between the two
German states.''
   The orders reportedly have been temporarily suspended at times,
for example during President Reagan's visit to West Berlin last
year.
   Maik Sohr, a former East German soldier who fled to the West in
May, said he estimated that 90 percent of those who want to flee to
West Germany are apprehended before they can make an attempt.
   He said special security units track potential escapees by
watching for unusually large bank withdrawals or sales of personal
possessions.

<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo threatened
Friday to crack down on student demonstrations to safeguard the
Olympics. Radicals on six campuses hurled firebombs and rocks at
police, who fired tear gas.
   ``An eruption of demonstrations involving firebombs, stones and
tear gas during the Olympics would disrupt the Olympics, and our
nation would become an object of worldwide scorn,'' Roh told a
meeting reviewing preparations for the games, scheduled to begin
Sept. 17.
   Also Friday, South Korea asked North Korea to meet at the truce
village of Panmunjom in one week to discuss the possibility of full
parliamentary talks on easing tension on the Korean peninsula.
   About 6,000 radical students from 22 universities held rallies
or staged violent street demonstrations in Seoul and six provincial
cities, protesting a police blockade of a march to North Korea for
unification talks. The march is planned for Monday.
   Riot police fired tear gas to drive students back at six
campuses. Witnesses reported some arrests and injuries, but police
declined to give any figures.
   National Police Headquarters in Seoul said 2,099 radicals were
detained Wednesday and Thursday for taking part in demonstrations
to support the march. It said all but 243 were released.
   Riot police continued to ring college campuses and stand guard
at government buildings to try to foil preparations for the march
to the Panmunjom border truce site. The government banned the march
and police have mounted a major security effort to block it.
   Police officials said students have attacked 13 police stations
around the country this week, and several dozen officers were
injured.
   Roh accused radical students of trying to overthrow the
government and siding with North Korea's demand to be a co-host of
the Olympics,
   Roh appealed to opposition leaders Kim Dae-jung and Kim
Young-sam, who attended the Olympic briefing, to dissuade radical
students from the march and violent protests. The opposition
promised support for the Olympics but stressed the need for
dialogue between the government and student leaders.
   ``It is deplorable that a small number of dissidents and radical
students are huring a successful Olympic mood with demonstrations
and calls for joint Olympics,'' Roh said.
   North Korea sought the meeting on tension-easing measures for
Wednesday, but South Korea counterproposed Friday. The two-day
delay apparently is aimed at protecting celebrations of the
``Olympic Mood'' on Wednesday, 30 days before the start of the
Olympics.
   North Korea has called for a meeting of the two countries'
legislatures to discuss its bid to become a co-host of the Olympics
and draft a non-aggression pact.
   The peninsula has been divided since 1945 at the end of World
War II. North Korea invaded the south in 1950 to start the Korean
War.

<TEXT>
   President Kenan Evren approved a
constitutional amendment Friday to allow earlier municipal
elections, opening the way for a national referendum on the issue.
   The amendment, backed only by the governing Motherland Party,
passed 284-95 in the 450-seat legislature a week ago.
   Turkey's 1982 Constitution, written under military rule,
requires at least five years between local elections. That meant
local elections could not be held in Turkey before March 1989.
   The amendment calls for local elections nationwide on Nov. 13.
   But the nation must vote on any constitutional amendment adopted
by fewer than 300 votes in Parliament.
   The referendum is expected to take place Sept. 25.
   Political analysts say the governing party wants early polls
partly because they do not want to give the main opposition Social
Democrats time to organize under new leadership.

   The light sheen of oil left by a ruptured
barge in the Gulf of Mexico was drifting away from barrier islands
on the Mississippi Gulf Coast and should eventually evaporate, the
Coast Guard said today.
   ``The situation is definitely improving,'' said Coast Guard
Petty Officer Bob Morehead. At one point Thursday, the oil slick
had threatened to wash onto the beaches of Ship and Cat islands
about 10 miles off the Mississippi mainland.
   An estimated 5,000 gallons of oil leaked from the barge after it
struck a submerged barge early Thursday a few miles off the
Mississippi coast. The submerged barge, which was loaded with scrap
iron, had sunk Monday during the rough seas of Tropical Storm Beryl.
   Morehead said 10,000 barrels of oil was pumped from damaged
areas of the oil barge onto another vessel Thursday night, allowing
the barge to float free. It was moved away from the site of the
accident and was no longer leaking oil, he said.
   The patches of oil remaining from the leak were too light to be
skimmed from the water, but the sun and wind should evaporate most
of the crude as it drifts out to sea, Morehead said.
   ``We talked with the Mississippi Bureau of Marine Resources and
they said there was very little potential for major environmental
damage due to the oil,'' Morehead said.

   Forty Soviet missile experts
prepared Friday for a second round of inspections on U.S. rocket
sites in West Germany covered by a superpower arms treaty, a U.S.
official said.
   In July, Soviet inspectors visited two missile sites in West
Germany, while other checks have taken place in the United States,
the Soviet Union and other U.S. Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Pat
Maloney said the 40 Soviets would be divided into four teams.
   ``There are four teams, and four sites remaining to be
checked,'' Maloney told The Associated Press. He noted, however,
that there had been no official announcement of the Soviets'
destinations.
   The first group of Soviet inspectors in West Germany visited the
Mutlangen Pershing 2 site 27 miles east of Stuttgart and the
Wueschheim cruise missile site 25 miles south of Koblenz.
   The remaining sites include Pershing 2 bases located at Neu-Ulm,
50 miles southeast of Stuttgart, and at Neckarsulm, 25 miles north
of Stuttgart.
   In addition, a Pershing 2 storage site is located about three
miles northwest of Kaiserslautern, and a missile maintenance
facility is located in the Frankfurt suburb of Hausen.
   U.S. officials say there are 220 intermediate-range missiles in
West Germany that fall under the terms of the treaty signed by
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in December.
   The checks are to make sure that items found at the missile
sites correspond to what has been listed by the superpowers in the
agreement.

   President Reagan has selected Army Lt. Gen. H.
Norman Schwarzkopf to become the next head of the U.S. Central
Command, the military arm responsible for all American forces in
the Middle East, the Pentagon said Friday.
   Assuming Senate confirmation, Schwarzkopf would replace Marine
Gen. George Crist, whose tenure has included more than a year of
tanker escorts by American warships in the Persian Gulf as well as
combat clashes between U.S. and Iranian forces. Crist is to step
down from his command on Nov. 23 and retire.
   Schwarzkopf's selection had been widely rumored for several
weeks, ever since Pentagon sources disclosed Defense Secretary
Frank C. Carlucci had rebuffed pleas by the Navy to install an
admiral as Crist's successor.
   Vice Adm. Henry C. Mustin, the deputy chief of naval operations,
plans, policy and operations, was the Navy's candidate. Instead,
the Pentagon announced Friday that he will retire on Sept. 1 after
more than 33 years of active service.
   When the Central Command was originally created as the follow-on
to the Rapid Deployment Force of the Carter administration,
Pentagon officials decided the commanding general should rotate
between the Marine Corps and Army in case troops had to be sent in.
   At the time, the biggest threat to peace in the region was
considered the Soviet Union, which was viewed as having designs on
the oil supplies that are crucial to the West.
   But then the Iran-Iraq war erupted and expanded to the waters of
the Persian Gulf, and President Reagan decided last year to escort
reflagged Kuwaiti tankers through the waterway. That prompted the
Navy to begin arguing for a naval expert in the top job.
   Carlucci finally intervened in the matter, deciding even before
the recent cease-fire agreement between Iran and Iraq to stick with
the original rotation plan.
   Schwarzkopf, 53, now is the Army's deputy chief of staff for
operations and plans and the senior Army member of the Military
Staff Committee to the United Nations. He would receive his fourth
star and the rank of general in assuming the new job.
   The Pentagon said Reagan has nominated Lt. Gen. John W. Foss to
assume Schwarzkopf's old post. Foss, 55, now is the commanding
general of the XVIII Airborne Corps and of Fort Bragg, N.C. Maj.
Gen. Carl W. Stiner, 51, would replace Foss and be promoted to
lieutenant general.

beckoning to passers-by while multicolored bunting competes for
attention with a fake pair of women's legs that swing forward and
back from two stories above.
   On this naughty street of take-out drinks and knockout strip
shows, merchants are hoping to lure Republicans with traditional
tawdriness and newfound politics.
   ``He's tan, rested and ready _ Nixon in 1988'' adorns one
T-shirt bearing a black and white likeness of the former president.
Other shirts found in various souvenir shops carry the standard
logo of the official 1988 GOP convention.
   Bourbon Street is ready for the Republicans. The question,
however, is are the Republicans ready for Bourbon Street?
   ``Everybody should see this city,'' said Jeff Levy, a delegate
from Los Angeles. ``There are lots of weirdos here, but everyone
should see them. It's hot, but excellent.''
   Wrought-iron balconies, bars named for pirates, provocative
dancers of both sexes and 24-hour liquor attract an eclectic group.
   Michael Montolbano, the doorman at Pat O'Briens where tourists
slurp rosy-colored Hurricanes in a glass they can take home, said
some Republicans have already experienced the street.
   ``You can spot `em by the way they dress in those $800 suits and
the way they carry themselves. Power tie, power look, the whole
bit,'' he said.
   Dancer Bonnie Holloway said she expects the Republicans to party
just like everyone else.
   ``If they get drunk, they should spend money. There's going to
be a lot of men at this convention, they said, so it'll be good for
us,'' she said.
   The doorman at Papa Joe's, which bills itself as having the only
female impersonators on Bourbon Street, said Republicans seem to
enjoy looking at men dressed up like women.
   ``They seem to be having fun. At least they get a couple of
laughs out of here,'' said Manny Moreland.
   But a hostess at the Coffee Pot, around the corner from Bourbon
Street, and a bartender at Court Liquors To Go said they've noticed
little change _ yet.
   The French Quarter, of course, is not the only place New Orleans
likes to party.
   ``A Grand Party for the Grand Old Party'' started the convention
festivities on Friday with a picnic in City Park. Probably the only
family event scheduled for the week, the Grand Party featured
bands, choirs, fireworks and free rides on the park's narrow-gauge
trains and flying horses, a turn-of-the-century carousel.
   The Elephant Romp on Saturday will attract delegates and people
willing to shell out $100 per person for a trip to the Audubon Zoo.
The Greater New Orleans Convention Fund hopes to raise $400,000 to
help defray city costs for hosting the convention.
   Tents featuring Louisiana themes, food and music will be spread
about the zoological park.
   Beginning Sunday, fancy clothes and political bigwigs will
dominate the many private parties on social calendars.
   Among those featured convention week are a masked ball for
Senate insiders at the New Orleans Museum of Art and the
Conservative Victory Committee Ball featuring comedian and
impersonator Rich Little.
   New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump has accepted an
invitation to a jazz brunch at the home of Freeport-McMoRan chief
Jim Bob Moffett for 30 of his Fortune 500 counterparts. Other
guests expected to attend are Texas Air chairman Frank Lorenzo, The
Washington Post's Katharine Graham and Allen H. Neuharth of Gannett

   Sein Lwin rose to prominence by
personally killing a Burmese rebel leader in 1950 and commanding an
army company that shot down rioting Rangoon University students in
1962.
   When thousands of students went on a rampage last March in some
of the worst riots Burma has experienced, Sein Lwin led the forces
that stopped them.
   Analysts had suggested the 64-year-old former general would be a
logical scapegoat as the government of Ne Win, his close ally,
sought to appease critics and stabilize the country.
   Instead, Sein Lwin emerged last month as Burma's most powerful
leader to succeed Ne Win, who resigned after wielding near absolute
power since a coup 26 years ago.
   Protests of authoritarian rule intensified this week and
soldiers killed at least 95 demonstrators. Protesters carried
placards calling Sein Lwin a ``dog, Nazi and butcher of students,''
and many Burmese said he was the most hated man in the country.
   On Friday, Sein Lwin resigned as president of Burma and chairman
of the ruling Burma Socialist Program Party.
   Little has been published about Sein Lwin and others in Burma's
senior hierarchy, most of whom live in seclusion.
   According to John Badgley, a Burma expert at Cornell University
in the United States, Sein Lwin is a Mon tribesman born in Mattama
village. The Mons are one of several ethnic minorities in the
Southwest Asian country.
   He completed the fourth grade at most in a Buddhist monastery
school. Many Burmese still look down on him for his low level of
education and relative lack of manners.
   Sein Lwin joined the army in 1942 when Burmese officers,
including Ne Win, were siding with Japan against the Allies _
specifically Britain, colonial master of the former kingdom.
   As the war progressed, the officers switched allegiance,
realizing Japan was as much a threat to Burma's independence as
Britain. Independence in 1948 was followed by a chaotic, 14-year
experiment with democracy.
   Maj. Sein Lwin became known during that period as the man who
cornered and killed Sabaw U Gyi, leader of the ethnic Karen
rebellion. He developed a reputation as a man with courage and
decisiveness, but limited vision and a strain of brutality.
   Among the troops, his nickname was ``chinthe,'' for the mythical
lion that guards the entrances of Buddhist temples in Burma.
   He once was Ne Win's personal aide, and was at the leader's side
when Ne Win seized power in 1962 and began enforcing his brand of
economic socialism, military-backed authoritarian rule and
isolation from much of the world.
   Soon after the coup, Sein Lwin led his army unit in quelling the
riots at Rangoon University, firmly establishing his reputation as
an unbending leader prepared to wield an iron fist to root out
opposition.
   Most Burmese are interested in the supernatural, but Sein Lwin
has a preoccupation with astrology, magic and black arts and for
three years was the secret publisher of a magazine called Veda
dealing with such matters, Badgley said in an interview.
   Sein Lwin retired from the army and in 1977 joined the party's
Central Executive Committee. He won the No. 4 party post of joint
general secretary in 1985 and also became secretary of the Council
of State, the No. 3 position in the government after president and
vice president.
   He has held ministerial portfolios for cooperatives, transport,
communications, and home affairs.
   On March 18, a day later dubbed ``Bloody Friday,'' thousands of
students swept through downtown Rangoon, burning cars and shouting
anti-government slogans. It was the second student outburst in
three months.
   The ``Lon Htein,'' or riot police, were called out, reinforced
by regular army units and armored vehicles. Western diplomats and
Burmese sources said Sein Lwin commanded the police from a tactical
headquarters at the government broadcast station.
   They said he overruled some leaders who wanted to be more
lenient. The government has acknowledged 43 deaths, but more than
100 people are believed to have been killed.

<HEAD>Three US Officials Caught Taking Material Out of Soviet Union</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS lead to clarify that Fitzwater did not specify that the

   Three members of a U.S. government team taking
part in a nuclear testing experiment in the Soviet Union engaged in
``some unauthorized souvenir collection'' there, the White House
said today.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, however, said that
based on information available so far to U.S. officials, ``we don't
believe it was intelligence activity of any kind.''
   ``The individuals picked up and attempted to ship on for their
personal use some rock samples, a piece of barbed wire, an Allen
wrench and a hammer,'' Fitzwater told reporters at the White House.
   ``The individuals involved have been removed from the list of
those who might return for the experiment,'' he said.
   Fitzwater noted that the team was in the Soviet Union under the
auspices of an agreement, announced by President Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, for a joint verification experiment in
the field of nuclear testing.
   ``We don't believe it was intelligence activity of any kind, but
it was a personal mistake on their part,'' Fitzwater said, adding
that ``we have informed the Soviet Union of this, yes.''
   Fitzwater declined to divulge the names of the three people
involved.
   The team apparently was under the auspices of the Energy
Department. Fitzwater said only that it included geologists who
were there to work with rocks and minerals related to the
experiment.
   The materials were discovered by Soviets inspecting equipment
crates being prepared for shipment back to the United States, said
Deputy Press Secretary Roman Popadiuk.
   The Washington Post reported in today's editions that Moscow had
issued a formal diplomatic protest over the July 17 incident.
   But Fitzwater said there had been no formal exchanges.
   A U.S. official told the newspaper that both the Soviet Union
and the United States were trying to resolve the problem in a
``low-key'' manner.
   The team was in the Soviet Union under an agreement by which the
superpowers are allowing each other to observe and monitor each
other's nuclear blasts. The agreement is not connected to the
monitoring of weapons under the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces
treaty, a Defense Department spokesman said.
   ``There's no question but that we stepped over the bounds of the
agreement,'' the newspaper quoted an unidentified senior
administration official as saying Thursday. The official said the
incident presumably stemmed from an innocent mistake.
   The attempted shipment by the Americans, who were not
identified, involved materials such as tools and wire associated
with Soviet nuclear test preparations at the test site near
Semipalatinsk in south-central Russia as well as soil and rock
samples of potential use in assessing yields of Soviet nuclear
blasts, the newspaper quoted officials as saying.
   The items were found by Soviet authorities during a search of a
crate of personal belongings of a U.S. official and two employees
of private firms under contract to the federal government, the Post
said.
   Spokesmen for the departments of energy and state as well as the
Soviet Embassy declined to comment. The Energy Department,
according to the Post, has conducted a secret investigation of the
incident.
   Robert Barker, assistant secretary of defense for atomic energy
and chairman of the military liaison to the Energy Department, told
the Post the Americans were ``absolutely not'' deliberately trying
to collect prohibited materials.
   When contacted late Thursday by The Associated Press, Barker
denied making the comment to the Post and refused to speak about
the issue.
   The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a private protest
July 25 to U.S. diplomats that demanded permanent expulsion of the
three and a detailed explanation, the newspaper reported.
   The U.S. official and one of the contractor employees had left
the country before the protest was issued, and the other contractor
employee was allowed to remain in the Soviet Union after the United
States denied he was responsible, the Post said.
   A U.S. official not identified by the newspaper said, ``We are
trying to resolve it in a low-key way ... and the Soviets are,
too.''
   The special nuclear experiment for which the team was in the
Soviet Union is scheduled for next month at the test site near
Semipalatinsk.
   The Post quoted unidentified senior U.S. officials as saying the
incident was not expected to halt the progress of the agreement,
which also calls for observation of tests at the U.S. site in
Nevada.
   The project in question was part of the Joint Verification
Experiment concerning nuclear testing and ``has nothing to do with
on-site inspection or the INF Treaty,'' Navy Cmdr. Ken Pease told
The Associated Press on Thursday night.

   The former finance minister resigned
from Parliament and the governing party Friday after accusing the
government of being unable to solve Sri Lanka's ethnic problems.
   Ronnie de Mel demanded new elections, saying it was the ``only
way to solve the present problems of our people.''
   De Mel, 63, was finance minister from 1977 until 1987. He said
the government had lost the right to rule by not holding elections.
   The United National Party of President Junius R. Jayewardene has
been in power since 1977. It held a referendum to extend its
governing period in 1982 after its five-year term expired, and
general elections are due in August 1989.
   De Mel, a Sinhalese Buddhist, criticized the government for
failing to end the Tamil insurgency.
   Tamil militants, who claim discrimination by the Sinhalese
majority, are fighting for a separate homeland in the island
nation's north and east. Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million people.

<TEXT>
   A forest fire fanned by gusty wind has closed one road to Old
Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park, and firefighters
today faced dozens of lightning-started fires in Idaho.
   Fire burning underground in a peat bog in Washington state
bedeviled firefighters and choked a Seattle suburb with smoke.
   ``You're walking along and it looks like solid ground and then
you fall three feet into hot coals,'' said Lynda Coombs, a
volunteer at Redmond, Wash. ``It's like standing in a barbecue
pit.''
   Forest and brush fires also burned in California, Montana and
Nevada. A grass fire in Utah was contained and firefighters
controlled a lightning-sparked grass fire that burned up to 15,000
acres in the Nebraska panhandle.
   In Yellowstone, the 40,000-acre North Fork fire jumped across
the road north of Old Faithful and authorities said the road
probably would open and close periodically with increased fire
activity. The geyser was still accessible from the south. Extra
crews of firefighters were assigned to the blaze as it moved
eastward, bringing the force up to 700 people.
   ``The fire has been moving very fast, is burning very hot and
putting up a large column of smoke,'' said park spokeswoman Joan
Anzelmo. The column of smoke was between 35,000 and 40,000 feet
high Thursday afternoon.
   About 2,000 firefighters were working on fires that had burned
about 196,000 acres of Yellowstone as of Thursday.
   Flames quieted down enough on the 34,000-acre Shoshone and Red
fires in the park to allow officials to reopen the majority of the
approximately 400 spaces at the Grant Village campground today,
Anzelmo said.
   A thunderstorm that swept through Idaho Thursday dotted the
state's forests and rangelands with flame. Estimates of the number
of fires jumped from 50 to 75 Thursday night as dispatchers
received more reports.
   The Walker Creek fire on the Caribou National Forest forced the
evacuation of about 16 families from their homes on Indian Creek
south of Inkom in southeastern Idaho. The 3,000-acre blaze was
believed contained Thursday but wind gusting to 25 mph pushed the
flames over lines and toward the homes.
   Crews in the Challis National Forest in central Idaho worked to
create a buffer between the 13,500-acre Battleaxe wilderness fire
and a guard station and a private airstrip about a mile to the
south.
   Smoke from the peat bog fire at Redmond, Wash., combined with
patchy fog, has caused morning commuter traffic problems and road
closures, and the stench has choked residents and dairy cows.
   An irrigation sprinkler was used to apply 35,000 gallons of
water an hour, cooling the ground so firefighters could walk on it
and use hoses to spray the smoldering peat as it was exposed by
bulldozers and backhoes.
   ``It's so hot out there you're pants will catch on fire. It will
get in your boots,'' said Bill James, a volunteer firefighter from
Carnation.
   Police Sgt. George Potts said visibility was so low in the smoke
Thursday morning that he couldn't see a patrol car with flashers
working more than six feet away. ``It's like driving into a brick
wall,'' Potts said.
   Firefighters in Nevada controlled a lightning-caused blaze after
it charred 1,800 acres of brush with 50-foot-high flames in the
outskirts of Carson City that forced about 200 people to briefly
evacuate their homes.
   Crews in Montana worked today to cut fire lines through the
steep Elkhorn Mountains to battle the Warm Springs Creek fire. The
fire has burned some 2,500 acres in the Helena National Forest,
about 15 miles southeast of Helena, and fire information officer
Dave Turner said elevations in the fire area ranged from 5,800 feet
to 8,500 feet.
   An out-of-control fire fueled by heavy brush and pushed by
strong, erratic wind put more than 1,300 firefighters to the test
in the Sequoia National Forest early today, burning more than 2,000
acres, officials said. The fire destroyed two cabins and threatened
others in steep terrain about 35 miles northeast of Bakersfield.

<HEAD>Hospital Drops Hinckley Field Trip After New Letters Uncovered</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: St. Elizabeths, no apostrophe, is cq</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mental hospital Friday abandoned plans to
take John W. Hinckley Jr. on a field trip after the Secret Service
turned up a new cache of writings by the man who shot President
Reagan seven years ago.
   The decision by St. Elizabeths Hospital was announced at a
hearing originally convened by U.S. District Judge Barrington D.
Parker to consider the plan to allow Hinckley to join other
patients on a supervised outing.
   But letters by Hinckley found this week during an investigation
by the Secret Service prompted hospital officials to drop their
request.
   Based on ``recent materials received'' Thursday night, the
hospital ``determined that further clinical assessment by Mr.
Hinckley's treatment staff is necessary before it would permit him
to participate in such an off-grounds activity,'' said Dr. Raymond
F. Patterson, reading from a letter sent to the judge.
   ``The hospital no longer plans to include Mr. Hinckley in the
upcoming recreational activity in the community,'' Patterson,
director of St. Elizabeths Hospital's forensic services unit, added.
   Comments during the hearing by U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens and
defense lawyer Vincent Fuller indicated that the writings were
letters Hinckley had sent to an unidentified third party.
   Parker said he would not grant Stephens' request to release the
writings, which prosecutors had placed under court seal Thursday
night, until Fuller had a chance to file an objection.
   Fuller said Hinckley may have some ``proprietary interest'' in
the writings that would prevent them from being released.
   Hinckley, who wore a sport jacket and tie, sat impassively
throughout the brief hearing.
   The White House declined comment. ``We have never taken a
position on Hinckley matters, and we wo't now,'' spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said.
   Outside the U.S. Courthouse, Stephens said he would continue his
efforts to make the writings public because ``they relate to a
matter of great national importance, they relate to an individual
who shot the president of the United States.''
   ``The public should be aware of what these materials are,''
Stephens said, indicating that the writings figured directly in the
hospital's decision the request to take Hinckley on a field trip.
   ``We provided materials to St. Elizabeths last night; they
withdrew their request for an off-site visit this morning,''
Stephens said.
   The decision also came after federal prosecutors cited
``disturbing entries'' made this week in Hinckley's treatment
record at the hospital.
   Hinckley, 33, has been confined to St. Elizabeths since he was
acquitted by reason of insanity of shooting Reagan, presidential
press secretary James S. Brady and two other men on March 30, 1981.
   Brady, who was shot in the head, remains confined to a
wheelchair and has difficulty speaking as a result of the injuries
he suffered.
   Hospital officials had not formally outlined its specific plan
for the outing. But court records indicate the field trip may be a
picnic or a party at a bowling alley.
   The hospital dropped a request in April 1987 to allow Hinckley
to visit his parents during the Easter weekend after investigators
turned up evidence he had traded letters with multiple murderer
Theodore Bundy, who is held on Florida's death row.
   A psychiatrist testified last year that Hinckley also had once
received a letter from Lynette ``Squeaky'' Fromme, who is
imprisoned for trying to kill President Ford in 1975.
   Hinckley's correspondence with Bundy and other writings seized
from his room last year remain under court seal.

   Programmers hope a new software program that can
print out music as it's played will score a hit with composers.
   ``You play, it prints. It's a speeding up of the whole
process,'' said John Borowicz, a co-creator of the program. ``It
understands everything about standard music notation and it can
accurately transcribe what you play.''
   The program, called ``Finale'' by Coda Music Software of
Bloomington, Minn., was unveiled Thursday at the Macworld Expo
Boston '88. The program can translate information from a keyboard,
guitar or wind instrument.
   Borowicz, a composer and computer scientist, said he and his
partner Phil Farrand worked on musical transcription software for
about five years before producing the program.
   The software, he said, costs $1,000 and is ``aimed at the
professional level, or the intense amateurs.''
   Although he said the new program will allow composers to produce
more music in less time, some musicians were hesitant to applaud
the new development.
   Ran Blake, the director of the New England Conservatory of
Music's department of Third Stream Studies, said he was personally
interested but questioned whether it was an appropriate tool for
students.
   ``I wonder if they shouldn't have a mentor'' to teach them such
intricacies as harmony, he said.
   Although word processing has advanced rapidly, music notation
has benefited little from technology. Some software programs allow
composers to print music by punching in notes on a computer staff,
but the new program frees musicians from working separately on
composing, performing and editing.
   The new program, Borowicz said, is ``works the way the musician
works. The musician does not have to work the way the software
works.''
   Finale allows the musician to edit a piece at any point.
   ``You can play it back. You can stop it at any point. You can
manipulate down to the micro level,'' Borowicz said. ``You can also
point to the note, drag it to where you want it, or change it.''

   Here is a sampling of editorial reaction to the film ``The Last
Temptation of Christ,'' which was released Friday:
   
   ``In America, the right to be dumb or dead wrong is at least as
sacred as the right to be right. On matters of faith and belief
there can be no established rights and wrongs _ or freedom would
instantly evaporate.'' _ The Daily News of New York.

   ``Blasphemy is not the issue here, but censorship. ... But
complaining of a heathen plot against the faith is good box office
for the television pulpit. The would-be censors seek to shift
attention away from the capers of Jimmy Swaggart and Jim and Tammy
Bakker. The television preachers need to clean up their own
blasphemous act first.'' _ The Boston Globe.

<TEXT>
   ``The film deserves to be seen by as few people as possible and
then consigned to its well-deserved fate on the video store
shelves, where those who derive pleasure from the denigration of
Jesus Christ can privately indulge their sick little fantasies.
Movies like this tell us more about the temptations of the movie
business than about our great religions.'' _ The Detroit News.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``What many may find truly disturbing about the film is not its
depiction of a confused, human Jesus, but its director's reliance
on torn and bloody flesh, human and animal. The film sins against
taste. Gratuitous violence for box-office gain is the temptation
contrived by the devil who hides in cameras.'' _ The New York Times.

   About 25,000 demonstrators, some
lugging crosses, urged mass boycotts of ``The Last Temptation of
Christ'' upon its release today, and at least one major theater
chain has decided against showing the film.
   The movie opens in nine major cities at the height of a
nationwide fundamentalist furor sparked by Christians who say it is
blasphemous in its portrayal of a Jesus Christ tempted to abandon
his divinity.
   In New York City today, about two dozen demonstrators picketed
in front of the Ziegfeld Theater, some shouting at the hundreds of
film-goers who formed a line that wrapped around the block for a
matinee showing.
   ``We see it as an attack on morality and traditional family
values,'' said Rabbi Yosef Friedman, who carried a sign reading,
``Rabbis Protest Mockery of Any Religion.'' ``We feel these people
who are mocking Christianity today would also be willing to mock
Judaism.''
   ``WarGames'' director John Badham joined Warren Beatty and
Michael Mann at the Directors Guild of America today in support of
the film.
   ``We owe a debt of gratitude to this group of somewhat misguided
zealots. The film now will be seen by a lot of curiosity seekers,''
Badham said. ``What is not terrific is their effort to rewrite the
Bill of Rights.''
   An estimated 25,000 protesters jammed the streets around
Universal Studios Thursday, adding their voices to a chorus of
protest that has stretched from the studio lot to the halls of
Congress.
   ``A lot of impressionable people who would see this ... will
receive a totally skewed, biased, and blatantly false portrayal of
the person who is nearest and dearest to our hearts _ our savior
Jesus Christ,'' said the Rev. Paul Crouch, president of Trinity
Broadcasting.
   Newton, Mass.-based General Cinema Theaters decided against
showing the movie after company executives screened it this week.
The company _ the nation's fourth-largest movie chain with 1,338
screens in 318 locations _ offered no explanation for its decision.
   In Maryland, Delaware and North Carolina, newsletters and
petitions are being circulated in churches urging their members to
persuade theaters not to book the movie. The owners of Oregon's two
largest theater chains have said they will not show the film, as
did the 44-screen Douglas Theater Co. chain in Nebraska.
   And in Boston, Cardinal Bernard Law urged his archdiocese's
Roman Catholics to boycott the film because it is ``morally
offensive and repugnant to Christian belief.''
   ``One way to be heard is by not going. Another way is to write
the producers,'' Law wrote in the archdiocesan weekly paper.
   The movie, directed by Martin Scorsese and distributed by
Universal, opens to the public today in Los Angeles, Chicago,
Washington, San Francisco, Seattle, Minneapolis, New York, Montreal
and Toronto. An invitation-only screening Thursday in Montreal drew
about 30 peaceful protesters outside the theater.
   Last week, the studio suddenly advanced the release of the film
by six weeks, giving its opponents less time to organize threatened
boycotts and, perhaps, taking advantage of the current publicity.
   In Thursday's protest, buses carrying thousands of Christians
rolled into the Universal parking lot, backing up traffic for a
mile on the nearby Hollywood Freeway and on roads around the
headquarters of MCA Inc., Universal's parent company.
   Many demonstrators lugged wooden crosses. Others, with children
in tow, carried hand-printed signs reading ``Boycott Blasphemy''
and ``The Greatest Story Ever Distorted.''
   Opponents of the film are enraged by Scorsese's portrayal of
Jesus as an ambivalent savior. In a hallucination while dying on
the cross, Christ imagines abandoning his divinity to live as an
ordinary man, and fantasizes about sex with Mary Magdalene.
   Most of the film's antagonists have not seen ``Last Temptation''
and base their enmity on reports from the small number of clergy
who have viewed it.
   Scorsese has defended his film, saying he wished to create a
story that would provoke people to think about Jesus as a man
confronting temptation. He said the film should be considered art
translated from a novel, not an interpretation of the Gospels. The
film is based on the 1955 novel by Greek author Nikos Kazantzakis.
   Willem Dafoe, the actor who portrays Jesus Christ in the film,
said today that he is baffled by protesters' complaints.
   ``No, I don't understand, I don't understand. I just think this
is a beautiful, powerful, positive film. Some people that for the
most part haven't seen it are coming out against it _ that I don't
understand,'' he said in an interview on NBC-TV's ``Today'' program.
   While reactions from clergy across the nation have been largely
negative, some have been more tolerant.
   Beth Cox, summer minister for the Fairfax Unitarian Church in
Virginia, said Christ could have been tempted by the sensual.
   ``Jesus was man and divine,'' Ms. Cox said. ``I would think that
the human side of him would have those thoughts.''
   Yet other members of the clergy suggested that the best thing to
do was not to make much ado about the motion picture.
   ``We find the film offensive, but we're not going to turn out
the troops to march on theaters,'' Monsignor William Reinecke,
chancellor for the Catholic Diocese of Arlington, Va. ``We don't
want to play it up.''
   Among the participants in Thursday's demonstration were the Rev.
Donald Wildmon, executive director of the American Family
Association of Tupelo, Miss., and Bill Bright, president of the San
Bernardino-based Campus Crusade for Christ.
   Bright has offered to raise $10 million to buy and burn the
film, and Wildmon has urged a nationwide boycott of MCA.
   Conservative Reps. William E. Dannemeyer, R-Calif., Robert K.
Dornan, R-Calif., and Clyde Holloway, R-La., added their
denunciations late Wednesday in Congress, calling the movie
``scurrilous'' and ``blasphemous.''
   And in today's editions of The New York Times, a full-page ad
for the American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and
Property carries an open letter to Universal with the headline,
``On the Verge of a Public BLASPHEMY!''
   In Pine Bluff, Ark., notes sent to the Flick Twin Cinema and a
local newspaper claimed an Aug. 1 fire that damaged the Flick
theater was set as a warning not to show or advertise the film.
   Both notes, which were turned over to police, were similar and
signed in block letters, ``The Lord's Servant.''

   A letter from President Reagan to Mikhail S.
Gorbachev was delivered to a top Soviet official Friday by the U.S.
ambassador, and a Western official hinted the message concerned
talks on the ballistic missile treaty.
   The Western official, speaking on the condition he not be
identified by name or country, said that after handing over the
letter, U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock and Soviet First Deputy
Foreign Minister Yuli M. Vorontsov discussed the talks on the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
   The official, who was familiar with the meeting and the letter,
hinted that the message from Reagan also concerned the talks,
scheduled to start Aug. 24 in Geneva.
   The official news agency Tass reported that Matlock had
delivered a letter to Vorontsov from Reagan and said they discussed
``limiting nuclear and space arms, building on the talks held
during the Moscow summit meeting.''
   The Aug. 24 meeting is required under the ABM treaty, which
calls on the two superpowers to hold a conference every five years
to review its implementation.
   Disputes over the ABM treaty are among the stumbling blocks
toward reaching agreement on an accord that would halve the
superpowers' arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons. The Kremlin
contends Reagan's anti-missile program, popularly called ``Star
Wars,'' violates the ABM treaty, but Washington says it is allowed.
   At their summit in Moscow, Reagan and Gorbachev failed to
resolve the dispute.

   President Reagan, noting the approaching 27th
anniversary of the construction of the Berlin Wall, said Friday the
barrier is ``dramatic proof of communism's failed dream.''
   Noting a speech he gave last year challenging Soviet General
Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev to tear down the wall, Reagan said
``the United States is honored to stand firmly with the British and
French to defend the freedom and promote the well-being of Berlin.''
   ``Aug. 13 (Saturday) marks a sad anniversary,'' the president
said in a statement. ``That wall is a both a scar across the city
of Berlin and a symbol of the division of the German nation and of
Europe.''
   ``As tentative breezes of openness begin to stir the societies
in the East, the wall now stands in stark contrast to the human
struggle for freedom taking place in its shadow,'' Reagan said.
``There is no more dramatic proof of communism's failed dream than
the wall.''
   He said that ``as we recall the construction of the wall on this
day in 1961, the people the United States reaffirm their commitment
to Berlin and salute the brave people who live there.''

   A fire broke out today on the 86th floor of the
Empire State Building, and moved up a shaftway to the 102nd floor
at the top of the skyscraper, the Fire Department said.
   No injuries were reported immediately and no people were
trapped, but firefighters were having trouble with water pressure
in fighting the higher blaze, said Efrain Parrilla, a department
spokesman.
   Several floors were evacuated because of smoke while the 86th
floor fire, a small blaze in a utility room, was extinguished,
Parrilla said. The 86th floor houses the main observatory.
   The alarm had sounded automatically at 1:02 p.m., he said, and
the fire was quickly put out.
   The 102nd-floor fire was discovered at 1:48 p.m.

<HEAD>USDA Sees Economic Problems if Softwood Depletion Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Much of the South could suffer economically if
the depletion of softwood timber continues at the current pace
without being replaced, a senior Agriculture Department official
said Friday.
   Forest Service Chief F. Dale Robertson said a new study by the
USDA agency, state forestry agencies and universities, and the
forest industry found that the annual removal of timber is greater
than growth in many areas of the South.
   Timber is the region's leading agricultural crop, and the
processing of timber and timber products is the primary source of
employment, he said.
   ``Although the results of this study are of concern, we have
also found numerous opportunities for ensuring that timber
production can continue to prosper and grow in the South,''
Robertson said.
   ``Since the 1880s, when the South's first forest was devastated
by fire and poor management, two new forests have been regenerated
and harvested,'' he said. ``The South's fourth forest, the forest
of the future, can be even more productive.''
   According to the report, 22 million acres of cropland and
pasture in the South would be of more value if the lands were
planted in pine trees.
   Conversion to timber production could increase annual softwood
growth by 2.1 billion cubic feet, the report said. And the
replanting of cutover and non-productive trees on cutover lands
could increase net annual growth by an additional 3.2 billion cubic
feet.
   In other words, the study showed that conversion of cropland and
replanting could nearly double the South's current annual softwood
growth of 5.7 billion cubic feet.
   Robertson said the report presents a challenge and an
opportunity for southern farmers and landowners.
   ``Already, the owners of 1.5 million acres of highly erodible
cropland in the South have decided to plant trees on that acreage
under USDA's Conservation Reserve Program, he said. ``More
opportunities exist to increase timber growth profitably.''
   Copies of a summary of the report, ``The South's Fourth Forest:
Opportunities to Increase the Resource Wealth of the South,'' are
available from: USDA Forest Service, Southern Forest Experiment
Station, 701 Loyola Ave., New Orleans, La. 70113.

   Britain's newest princess entered royal life in
high style Friday with a flight to the queen's summer home in
Scotland after leaving the hospital with her parents, the Duke and
Duchess of York.
   Bundled in a white blanket, the still unnamed 4-day-old Princess
of York left Portland Hospital in the arms of her mother, Sarah, as
hundreds of spectators strained for a glimpse of her tiny face.
   A smiling Sarah wore a small bear-shaped badge which said, ``I'm
a Mum.''
   Minutes later, the princess was whisked off to Balmoral Castle,
where her grandmother Queen Elizabeth II was expected to approve a
name for her.
   The baby is the first child for Prince Andrew and his wife, and
the queen's fifth grandchild. She is fifth in line to the throne.
   The royal threesome drove straight from the hospital in central
London to a Royal Air Force base for a flight to the northern
Scottish coast and a car ride to the castle, said a Buckingham
Palace spokesman.
   The queen and her husband, Prince Philip, were to arrive at the
castle Monday after sailing up the Scottish coast on the royal
yacht Brittania, said the spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The monarch and her family traditionally spend parts of August
and September at the estate.
   At the hospital, hospital chefs and nurses joined several
hundred spectators awaiting the new princess' first appearance.
   Hospital spokeswoman Nicki Freer said, ``in general it has been
a pleasure having (the duchess) here. ... We all wanted to say
goodbye.''
   As the princess left the hospital, her face was barely visible,
but one newscaster narrating the event broadcast live on TV said
those ``with zoom lenses caught a glimpse of an eyebrow, an alert
eye, and a hint that she could have hair like her mother's.''
   There was a slight mishap when the red-headed Sarah handed the
baby to Andrew and stumbled while hurrying across the street to
receive a bouquet of pink carnations from an American tourist. She
recovered as bodyguards rushed to give her a hand.
   ``I waved my flowers and she started to walk over,'' said Heidi
Alasio of Eugene, Ore. ``I'm very glad she didn't fall over all the
way. It was a very nice gesture that she came to get the flowers.''
   Andrew told reporters he hoped he would suffer ``only a few''
sleepless nights because of the baby. He is scheduled to return to
his naval duties in the Far East next week.
   Asked about his feelings for his daughter, he said: ``I am
overjoyed.''
   British bookmakers and newspapers say likely choices for the
baby's name include Charlotte or Victoria, although Andrew was
quoted as saying in May that he favored Annabel.

<TEXT>
   The state Senate today reviewed a
House-approved bill that would require counties to adopt central
purchasing systems, a reform proposal prompted by a widespread FBI
investigation into local corruption.
   The Legislature is meeting in a special session called by Gov.
Ray Mabus in an attempt to change the prevailing county system
under which each of five county supervisors directly oversees
operations in his or her district.
   As state auditor for the four years before he was elected
governor, Mabus assisted the FBI in its ``Operation Pretense''
investigation into corrupt county purchasing. It resulted in the
arrests of 52 supervisors in 24 counties, of which 43 were
convicted or pleaded guilty and 23 received prison sentences.
   The measure, which passed the House Thursday on a 111-10 vote,
is similar to a bill approved by the House at the end of the 1988
regular session.
   Under the House-passed bill, a unit system for road construction
and maintenance would have to be in place by Oct. 1, 1989.
Twenty-two counties already have a similar system. The central
purchasing system would remain in effect unless county voters
rejected the plan.
   The measure passed without debate and few amendments were
approved.
   One significant amendment adopted would prohibit a member of the
board of supervisors from acting also as county administrator,
central purchasing clerk or road manager.
   Members of the Senate County Affairs Committee met this morning
to discuss the bill after a brief session Thursday.
   Although the House and Senate were stalemated at the end of the
1988 session on the bill, Lt. Gov. Brad Dye said he believed things
would be different this time.
   ``These (Senate members) realize just like those House members
that we can't leave here wihout passing that legislation,'' he said.
   Under the new system, one appointed administrator would oversee
day-to-day purchasing for the county, a job currently shared by
supervisors.

   The USS Mobile Bay was
scheduled to depart Friday en route to the Persian Gulf, but it
stayed in port instead and Navy officials refused to say why.
   ``The deployment of USS Mobile Bay has been temporarily
postponed until further notice,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Tim Taylor, a
Mayport spokesman.
   Taylor said he could not discuss the reasons for the delay of
the movement of the ship and its 381 crew members.
   The Department of Defense public affairs office in Washington
announced the postponement Thursday, three days after United
Nations officials disclosed an impending cease-fire between Iraq
and Iran and only two days after the Navy said the guided-missile
cruiser would be deployed as scheduled.
   Maj. Shelley Rogers, a Defense Department spokeswoman in
Washington, said she couldn't comment on whether the delay had
anything to do with the scheduled cease-fire.

   Three U.S. technical experts involved in
monitoring Soviet nuclear blasts have been relieved of their duties
after the Soviets found them trying to make off with ``souvenirs''
from an atomic test site, administration spokesmen said Friday.
   The spokesmen, dismissing the episode as a ``misunderstanding,''
said the items found by Soviet authorities in creates being
prepared for shipment back home included a small hammer, a piece of
barbed wire, and several rock and core samples from a hole being
drilled at the site.
   The July 17 incident occurred near Semipalatinsk, in
south-central Russia. A U.S.-Soviet agreement allows each country
to observe and monitor each other's nuclear blasts. The U.S.
experts were at the site in advance of a planned explosion in
September.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said that after
consultations with Soviet authorities, it was decided that the
three, who were not identified, will not be returning to the
testing site next month.
   One was said to be an Energy Department employee and the other
two reportedly were working under Energy Department contracts.
   The Soviets expressed concern over the incident but no formal
protest was lodged, Redman said.
   Redman said the hammer and the barbed wire were intended as
personal souvenirs. As for the geological samples, the Americans
asked the Soviets for permission to remove the items and had reason
to believe the request would be approved, he said.
   ``These items were of a minor nature, certainly not of any
military or technical significance,'' Redman said, describing the
incident as a ``misunderstanding.''
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said, ``We don't believe it was intelligence activity of any kind,
but it was a personal mistake on their part.''
   Asked whether it wasn't strange for Americans to try to make off
with rocks and soil, Redman said, ``If you're involved in this kind
of work, those might be considered souvenirs.''
   The Washington Post reported in Friday's editions that the soil
and rock samples are regarded by U.S. officials as potentially
useful in assessing yields of Soviet nuclear blasts.
   One official told the Post that soil samples can be examined for
radioactive contaminaton, which might reveal the type and quantity
of nuclear materials used in nuclear bombs.
   But Redman said the rock and core samples were of the same type
as that already provided to U.S. experts by the Soviets.
   According to Redman, the issue has been discussed at length
between U.S. and Soviet authorities and is being resolved.
   He added that the joint monitoring program will continue with a
U.S. test set for Aug. 17 in Nevada and the Soviet test scheduled
for mid-September.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge removed from a Ku Klux
Klan case by an appeals court said today he wants to hear from the
Justice Department before deciding whether to bar himself from all
federal government cases.
   U.S. District Judge William M. Acker Jr., at the end of an
hour-long hearing on his own motion to ban himself from Justice
Department litigation, withheld any immediate ruling.
   He said he did not know how he would rule eventually but ``I
have made my mind up that I am not going to rule on my motion to
recuse until I hear from William Bradford Reynolds,'' who is
director of the civil rights division of the Justice Department.
   Acker said he wanted Reynolds' comments about his being assigned
to hear Alabama's college desegregation case, which has been marred
by judicial conflict, including bitter language over the removal of
a black federal judge, during the past several years.
   ``I will defer until I hear from him on that matter,'' Acker
said.
   Attending today's hearing was U.S. District Judge U.W. Clemon,
who in 1980 became the first black federal judge in Alabama. He was
removed from the college desegregation case by the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals on grounds that Clemon's past role as a
state senator and civil rights attorney presented a judicial
conflict.
   Clemon, in a 10-page opinion this week, fired back that he was
the victim of a double standard demeaning to black federal jurists.
   Acker, a 60-year-old white judge who was appointed by President
Reagan in 1982, was not urged to disqualify himself from all
federal government cases during today's hearing. Three attorneys _
Leon Ashford, Joe Whatley and Doug Jones _ told the judge they had
found him to be fair and impartial. They are not involved in the
litigation that led to Acker's removal from the Klan case.
   Earlier this month, U.S. Attorney Frank Donaldson instructed his
staff to stay away from today's hearing and said ``no one from the
Department of Justice'' would be on hand.

<TEXT>
   The Navy has decided not to send another
of its billion-dollar ``Aegis'' cruisers to the Persian Gulf to
replace the USS Vincennes, which shot down an Iranian airliner July
3, officers said Friday.
   Lt. Cmdr. Tim Taylor, a spokesman for Mayport Naval Station in
Florida, said the departure of the USS Mobile Bay ``has been
temporarily postponed until further notice.''
   The Mobile Bay had been scheduled to leave the base Friday to
join the U.S. Navy Joint Task Force Middle East, which includes 27
warships in the gulf and Arabian Sea.
   Taylor said he could not discuss the reasons and Maj. Shelley
Rogers, a Defense Department spokeswoman in Washington, declined
comment on whether the delay was related to Iran-Iraq cease-fire
scheduled for Aug. 20.
   Military sources in Bahrain indicated privately the decision was
related to an expected cutback in the size of the U.S. force after
a truce in the 8-year-old war, but would not be specific.
   They said the Vincennes was expected to remain in the region
until early September, and one said an end to the war would
``sharply reduce any need'' for the Navy to send another of its
most sophisticated warships to the region.
   Ships normally serve about three months with the Middle East
force and the Vincennes, which arrived May 22, had been expected to
leave for its home port at San Diego in the next two weeks.
   The military sources described the practice as ``flexible,'' but
would not say why the Vincennes was being kept on longer than
usual. U.S. Navy policy provides for ships to be away from home
ports no longer than six months.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci repeated this week that the
force of 27 warships, including 18 in the gulf, would be reduced
sharply if the cease-fire held for a ``prudent'' period.
   All 290 people aboard the Airbus A300 were killed when the
Vincennes mistook it for an Iranian F-14 fighter on an attack
course and shot it down with missiles.
   An official report is expected to be released later this month
after study by Carlucci and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   Pentagon officials have said it will blame ``human error'' by
radar operators in the stress of first-time combat. The ship had
sunk two Iranian gunboats in a skirmish less than an hour before
the jet passed overhead on a flight to Dubai from a
military-civilian airfield in Bandar Abbas.

   The film shows Jesus, played by Dafoe, beset by human
temptations and struggling against his fate as the son of God.
Thousands of people demonstated against the movie and its producers
as it opened in seven U.S. cities Friday.
   Martin Scorsese, a Roman Catholic and the film's director, has
described it as an affirmation of faith because Jesus resists his
temptations. Some Christian leaders agree, while others have called
for boycotts against the film and demonstrations against MCA Inc.,
parent company of filmmaker Universal Pictures.
   ``I think a lot of people are judgmental before they have seen
the picture,'' said the actor's father, William Dafoe, a retired
surgeon who moved to Orlando four years ago with his wife, a nurse.
   ``I think they should decide whether they like it or not when
they've seen it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Botha: U.S. Sanctions Bill Could Wreck Namibia Settlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha on Friday
accused U.S. congressmen of ``recklessness'' and said a tough
sanctions bill passed by the House of Representatives could
jeopardize a regional peace plan.
   Botha said the legislation would not help South African blacks
and might ``obstruct or make impossible'' an initiative to end
South Africa's 73-year rule over South-West Africa, also known as
Namibia.
   ``The recklessness of members of Congress who do not care in the
least whether their actions adversely affect the search for a
peaceful solution to the problems of southern Africa as a whole is
astounding,'' Botha said.
   The sanctions bill would halt U.S. investment in South Africa
and impose a near-total trade embargo. It was approved by the House
on a 244-132 vote Thursday.
   The bill faces a possible Republican filibuster in the Senate
and a likely veto by President Reagan. Earlier legislation, which
passed despite Reagan's veto, bars imports of various South African
commodities and forbids South African planes to land at U.S.
airports.
   Botha said the bill emerged ``for purely internal political
aims.''
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater also
denounced the bill, saying it would ``destroy America's
flexibility'' to seek change through diplomatic pressure.
   Republican members urged the House to adopt a policy of ``black
empowerment'' to increase the economic and political power of
blacks and weaken apartheid's foundations.
   But Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., a sanctions supporter, said:
``Black economic empowerment in the face of apartheid is an
impossibility.''
   Leading black anti-apartheid activists in South Africa,
including Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, have urged the West to
intensify sanctions as a means of pressuring the government to
grant full political rights to the 26 million blacks, who have no
vote in national affairs under apartheid.
   Many black moderates and conservatives, as well as several
prominent white liberals, support the government's contention that
sanctions will have the harshest effect on blacks and will harden
the white minority's resistance to political change.
   Botha said he found it ``particularly remarkable'' that the
House acted on the bill ``exactly at a time when positive progress
was being made with the peace negotiations between South Africa,
Cuba and Angola.''
   The three countries Monday announced a cease-fire in the Angolan
civil war. South Africa said it was prepared to begin implementing
a U.N. plan for Namibian independence Nov. 1, provided agreement
could be reached on a timetable for withdrawing Cuba's troops from
Angola.
   The estimated 50,000 Cuban soldiers have been supporting
Angola's Marxist government in a 13-year war against a South
African- and U.S.-backed rebel movement. The movement, the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, is not a party to the
cease-fire.
   ``It would be ironical if Resolution 435 (the U.N. independence
plan for Namibia) should reach the point of implementation only to
be obstructed or made impossible as a result of provisions in the
American legislation,'' Botha said.
   He said unspecified financial transactions necessary to
implement the plan could be affected by the sanctions bill.

   Business inventories climbed for the 18th
consecutive month in June, the government said Friday, prompting
some economists to warn that companies may be stockpiling goods in
anticipation of higher prices.
   The Commerce Department said inventories jumped 0.7 percent to a
seasonally adjusted $733.9 billion in June, following an identical
0.7 percent rise in May. Inventory levels have not fallen since
December 1986.
   ``My guess is that there is a little buying ahead on inventories
in anticipation of higher inflation going on. When it happens, that
just adds to inflationary pressures,'' said Allen Sinai, chief
economist of the Boston Co.
   In a separate report, the Labor Department said wholesale prices
rose 0.5 percent in July, a 5.7 percent annual rate that was more
than double the 2.2 percent rate for all of 1987.
   However, other economists, noting that business sales have
increased more strongly than inventories, weren't troubled by the
gain in goods held on shelves and backlots.
   Business sales surged 1.5 percent in June to $490.6 billion
following a 0.8 percent gain in May. It was the fifth month without
a decline.
   ``Even though inventories were up sharply, they were still in
line with sales,'' said Kathleen Cooper, chief economist of
Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles.
   ``It's a reflection of the export-driven turnaround in
manufacturing. If you're selling more domestically and overseas,
then you need more inventory,'' she said.
   ``There's been some hedge buying against price increases, but we
think it's been fairly small,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, chairman
of the Wefa Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., consulting firm.
   Inventories in June were 7.8 percent higher than a year ago,
while sales were 8.1 percent higher.
   The June inventory accumulation was boosted by a 1.0 percent
climb at the retail level, where sales were weakest, a 0.8 percent
increase at the wholesale level and a 0.4 percent gain at factories.
   The strength in business sales was paced by a 2.5 percent jump
at wholesalers. Sales from manufacturing plants climbed 1.5 percent
and retail sales were up only 0.4 percent.
   An advance estimate of retail sales for July, released Thursday,
showed a 0.5 percent increase.
   The combination of strongly rising sales and moderately rising
inventories pushed the inventory-to-sales ratio down slightly from
1.51 in May to 1.50 in June. That means it would take 1.50 months
to exhaust inventories at the June sales pace, a ratio not
considered abnormally high.

<HEAD>Iranian President: War Made Iran a Regional Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HANNS NEUERBOURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Ali Khamenei said Friday that Iran
has emerged from eight years of war against Iraq as a victorious
regional power with new worldwide respect.
   Also on Friday, Iran denied Iraqi claims that it shelled Iraqi
military positions. A U.N. fact-finding team arrived in the Iranian
capital to investigate allegations of Iraq's use of chemical
weapons.
   ``Today, the system of the Islamic Republic of Iran, for all the
ineffective efforts of the enemies, has turned into an important
power in the whole of the region,'' Khamenei said at a prayer
sermon at the Tehran University campus. His remarks were broadcast
on state-run Tehran radio.
   ``The nation of Iran is counted as an armed and established
military force in the region,'' he said.
   Khamenei said Iran gained worldwide respect because of the
military prowess it displayed in the war, which he said the country
acquired without depending on outside powers.
   ``These eight years of war and resistance taught other nations
that it is possible to defend themselves without depending on big
powers,'' he said, adding Iraq had been defeated because ``it has
not been able to achieve its despicable objectives.''
   Iran and Iraq agreed last week to an Aug. 20 cease-fire in their
conflict, which killed or wounded an estimated 1 million people.
   Iran had recently suffered a series of losses on the
battlefield, leading it to accept a U.N. cease-fire resolution July
18.
   In another development, British diplomat David Reddaway arrived
in Tehran Friday for talks about British and other foreign hostages
held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian groups. Before leaving London,
Reddaway said he would speak with officials about the 18 hostages,
who include Anglican envoy Terry Waite and two other Britons as
well as nine Americans.
   The foreign hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March
16, 1985.
   A spokesman for the War Information Headquarters in Tehran
dismissed Iraq's claims of Iranian shelling as ``false
propaganda,'' the official Islamic Republic News Agency said.
   Baghdad accused Iran Thursday of shelling Iraqi military
positions near the Shatt al-Arab waterway, where the Persian Gulf
war broke out in September 1980.
   The accusation was made in a statement issued by the Iraqi
mission to the United Nations in New York. It was not carried on
newscasts in Iraq.
   In his speech, Khamenei urged Iranian volunteer and other forces
to remain at the front to defend the country and to give more power
to Iran on the international political scene.
   ``Even after the war, defense will continue and members of the
armed forces and volunteers must be present to defend Iran's
territorial integrity alongside the country's reconstruction,'' he
told the throng of worshipers.
   Worshipers chanted ``Down with the U.S.A.!'' ``Down with the
Soviet Union!'' and ``Down with Israel!'' and pledged to obey
revolutionary patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   The audience at Khamenei's sermon included about 100 Iraqi
prisoners of war, with about 25 of them wearing red headbands
indicating they want to fight Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   The crowd was smaller than that at a similar sermon attended by
an Associated Press reporter four weeks ago.
   An official at the prayer service said the crowd was small
``because so many people have followed the call to go to the battle
front.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Plastic collection boxes were on hand at the sermon for
worshipers to contribute to the war effort.
   Since Iran announced it was accepting the U.N. cease-fire
resolution, the once all-pervasive slogan ``War, war until
victory!'' has been abandoned, said a Westerner based in Tehran.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency said a four-member team of
chemical weapons experts would travel to the northwestern Kurdish
town of Oshnaviyeh in the province of West Azerbaijan.
   Iran alleges that a chemical attack on the town earlier this
month injured more than 2,000 civilians, including many women and
children.
   U.N. reports have confirmed Iraq's use of chemical weapons in
the past.
   At the United Nations, a spokesman said Friday that the 350
unarmed U.N. military observers monitoring the cease-fire between
Iran and Iraq will have headquarters in both Tehran and Baghdad.
   Several members of the observer group are already in Tehran and
Baghdad, and the rest are to be in place Wednesday in preparation
for the Aug. 20 cease-fire.

<HEAD>U.S., Lao Officials To Meet on MIAs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Laotian officials have agreed to meet
later this month to continue efforts at ascertaining the fate of
American servicemen missing in action from the Indochina war, the
State Department said Friday.
   The meeting between technical experts of both countries will
take place Aug. 22-23 in Vientiane, capital of Laos, department
spokesman Charles Redman said.
   ``We welcome this latest indication of Lao willingness to
increase cooperation in this important concern and other matters of
mutual interest,'' Redman said.
   Laos' agreement to hold the meeting is another sign of the
increasing openness of the communist government over the past year,
including economic reforms and plans to decentralize the
bureaucracy.
   The United States is trying to account for 555 Americans listed
as missing in action in Laos, many of them airmen downed during
missions against Laotian and Vietnamese communist positions.
   Under an agreement with the United States reached in August
1987, Laos ended a long period of inactivity on the MIA issue,
while the United States promised to consider Laos' request for
emergency food and other aid.
   Last May, U.S. and Laotian officials conducted a joint
excavation for the remnants of an American plane shot down in 1966
with two crewmen on board. No remains were found.
   Following the dig, the United States gave $13,000 worth of
medicine to a Laotian hospital. Laos' request for additional aid is
expected to be raised again in the talks this month.

<HEAD>Bush, Reagan Give Pep Talk; Dukakis Focuses on Prime Rate</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts new grafs 7-8 with Thompson dropping out of veep
consideration</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush, with President Reagan at his side, told
administration officials today they must persuade voters that in
the election ``what's at stake is a way of life.'' Democrat Michael
Dukakis blamed rising interest rates on ``eight years of borrowing
and spending, borrowing and spending.''
   In New Orleans, meanwhile, the 30,000-word GOP platform was
taking shape, combining statements of party positions on domestic
and foreign policy issues with sweeping attacks on Dukakis.
   Bush and Reagan, at the White House, addressed about 200
administration officials whom Bush said must be ``messengers of
hope'' in the campaign.
   ``All the good things you've accomplished are not in focus in
the minds of the electorate,'' the vice president said. The
officials' job, he said, would be to spread the word of
administration successes and pave the way for extending ``the
Reagan revolution into the Bush era.''
   Reagan, in a jovial mood, welcomed the officials ``to the White
House complex.''
   ``White House complex _ that's what the Democrats have after
eight years out of office. The incredible thing is, they still
can't take the hint,'' Reagan said.
   In Springfield, Ill., Gov. Jim Thompson, one of the people on
Bush's list of potential running mates, said he had called the vice
president and asked that he be removed from consideration.
   ``I talked to the family about it and I now believe that at this
moment in the time of Jim Thompson and his family, it's not the
right thing to do,'' Thompson told reporters.
   As the 106-member platform committee began its final session in
the party's convention city, Rep. Tom Loeffler of Texas said,
``There is one person who can fill the full measure of the awesome
charge of being president _ George Bush. The grim truth is, Mr.
Dukakis, that the Oval Office is no place for on-the-job training.''
   Winding up a five-state campaign swing, Dukakis said Reagan
administration budget deficits were to blame for rising interest
rates.
   ``As we all know, sooner or later the bill collector comes to
the door,'' Dukakis told a breakfast at the governor's mansion in
Richmond, Va. ``That's what happened yesterday in the United States
of America.''
   He referred to the fact that major banks raised their prime
lending rate half a percentage point Thursday to 10 percent. That
is the rate charged their largest, most credit-worthy customers.
   The Dukakis campaign also announced it was going on the air in
California and Texas with its first television advertisement of the
general election campaign.
   The one-minute commercial will stress Dukakis' economic themes,
his accomplishments as governor of Massachusetts, and include
excerpts from his Democratic convention speech.
   With less than a week to go before he will claim the GOP
presidential nomination in the mammoth Superdome, Bush was joining
President Reagan for a pre-campaign pep talk to senior
administration officials who are expected to fan out across the
country this fall to boost Bush.
   Interviewed on CBS, GOP Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf said the heart
of the platform ``will not change that much'' from its conservative
stance of 1980 and 1984.
   ``We're a conservative political party,'' he said. ``We're proud
of that. We're not afraid of the `c' word.''
   Fahrenkopf said the document will reflect Bush's plans for ``a
new direction in education, in environment, in child care.''
   ``The vice president came here in an unprecedented event and
spoke to this platform committee and tried to give them that
direction, so that this really will truly be a Bush platform,'' he
said.
   Before the GOP platform committee adjourned Thursday, it
finished its draft of domestic planks. The major remaining fight
was over a Star Wars plank that called for deployment of the
space-based missile defense system ``as soon as technically
feasible,'' language backed by Bush. Conservatives sought a call
for ``rapid and certain'' deployment.
   Bush, in Washington, told CBS he jogs and plays horseshoes to
help relieve the pressure of preparing for his acceptance speech at
next Thursday night's convention session. ``I'm no William Jennings
Bryan and I think it'll go OK,'' he said in a reference to the
Democratic politician and orator from the turn of the century.
   The Bush campaign leaked private polling data that said Senate
Republican leder Bob Dole helped Bush more than other potential
running mates, but by a margin not considered very significant.
   A campaign source said the Kansas senator and former rival for
the nomination added ``a little bit, but not enough to make much of
a difference.''
   The data from Bush's chief pollster Robert Teeter were described
as all but complete.
   Three national polls released Thursday showed Dukakis'
post-convention surge had crested. Dukakis' 18-point lead the week
after the Democratic convention shrank to 14 points in an NBC
News-Wall Street Journal survey conduced Aug. 5-8. A CNN-USA Today
poll the same Aug. 5-8 period gave Dukakis a 12-point lead, while a
Business Week poll done Aug. 4-9 put the two candidates in a dead
heat.
   All three of the polls placed support for Dukakis in the 50
percent range, while support for Bush ranged from 36 percent to 45
percent.
   The margins of error were three percentage points either way in
each poll.

   Hungarians angry about the noise caused
by low-flying Soviet military jets have succeeded in persuading the
Soviets to reduce the number of training flights and to fly at a
higher altitude, it was reported this week.
   A rare ``village meeting'' took place between residents of the
small towns of Szigethalom and Szazhalombatta in central Hungary
and commanders at the nearby Soviet base of Toekoel early this week.
   State television said the Hungarians pointed out cracks in walls
they said were caused by the piercing noise of low-flying jets.
   The Soviets agreed to stop any training flights on state and
religious holidays, Saturdays and Sundays, and between 2 p.m. and 4
p.m. on weekdays, television and radio reported.
   The number of training flights overall will be reduced and the
jets will fly at a higher altitude, the media said.

   President Reagan, claiming Americans ``don't
want to gamble their future on a blind date,'' told top
administration officials today that ``we are going to hold the
White House with George Bush.''
   Speaking to about 250 senior officials, including Cabinet
members, Reagan praised Bush, saying, ``he's been a great vice
president but I think he will an even greater president.''
   Bush, who spoke before the president at the pep rally in the Old
Executive Office Building, told the officials, ``I need you to help
mobilize our troops....I need you to march to victory again in
November.''
   The meeting today was one in a series of joint appearances
planned for the president and Bush, who will be installed formally
as the Republican presidential nominee next week at the Republican
National Convention in New Orleans.
   Many of the administration officials will speak on Bush's behalf
during the fall election campaign.
   ``Who's tending the store?'' Reagan jokingly asked the large
gathering of senior administration officials. ``Welcome to the
White House complex,'' he said. ``That's what our opponents have
after being eight years out of power,'' he joked.
   Reagan told the gathering he would be ``crisscrossing America
this fall'' for Bush's candidacy and to spell out the
accomplishments of the Reagan-Bush years.
   ``You all are part of a great and continuing success story,''
Reagan said.
   At the same time, Reagan said, ``We've got five full months
ahead of us. We're going to continue to advance our programs and
policies until we cross the finish line next January.''
   ``George Bush's policies work,'' Reagan said. ``The other folks
talk, George Bush will deliver...We are going to hold the White
House with George Bush.''
   ``Most people will vote for George Bush this year because, after
voting for him twice before, they know he's their guarantee that
peace and propsperity today will be followed by more peace and
prosperity tomorrow.''
   ``And frankly,'' Reagan continued, ``I don't think the American
people want to gamble their future on a blind date.''
   Reagan handed Bush a gavel at the conclusion of his speech,
claiming, ``I figure that with the convention coming up, you can
probably use that gavel. If not there, from experience there will
be a lot of meetings with the congressional leadership when you can
use that.''
   The meeting was attended by Cabinet and sub-Cabinet officials,
who are exempt from a federal prohibition on campaigning that
applies to lower-level federal bureucrats.
   Bush called the officials ``the field commanders of the Reagan
revolution'' and said, ``more than most Americans, you have an
important understanding of the importance of the election that
stands ahead.''
   Bush and Reagan are to meet again at an airport rally next
Tuesday in New Orleans, as Reagan leaves the convention city and
Bush arrives. The two also are expected to spend about four or five
days after the convention campaigning together, according to
campaign sources.
   Meanwhile, top Bush campaign advisers were to hold a strategy
session today to discuss convention logistics and the vice
president's closely guarded selection of a running mate.
   Bush said Thursday he would not discuss ``who's off the list and
who's on the list,'' although campaign sources did say that private
polls for the campaign show former rival Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
would give him a larger boost than others being considered.
   However, the sources also said that a Bush-Dole ticket showed up
as only marginally stronger than other potential combinations for
which polling was done.
   Dole's advantage ``is a little bit, but not enough to make much
of a difference,'' said one source.
   A ticket of Bush and Bob Dole ran stronger than a hypothetical
ticket of Bush and Dole's wife, former Transportation Secretary
Elizabeth Dole, the sources said.
   On Thursday, Bush met with a group of black Republican
supporters and vowed to make an aggressive effort to court black
voters who have traditionally voted Democratic.
   Bush said his campaign would demonstrate his ``commitment in the
field of civil rights and in opening the arms of this party.''
   He declined to say whether he would name a black to his Cabinet,
a promise he had made previously only to Hispanics. He also refused
to be dawn into a discussion of whether he was considering Lt. Gen.
Colin L. Powell, the first black ever to hold the post of national
security adviser, for the No. 2 spot.
   ``I have worked closely with Colin Powell and I have great
respect for him,'' Bush said. But, he added, ``Don't put it into
any vice presidential equation.''
   Several newspaper columns have suggested Powell as an ideal
running mate, an idea also backed by Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., who is
believed to be on Bush's ``short list.''
   Sources close to Bush's selection process said that Powell is
not being actively considered.
   Meanwhile, Bush said he's opposed to higher interest rates but
won't criticize the Federal Reserve's action this week raising the
discount rate, the rate it charges for short-term loans to banks,
from 6.0 percent to 6.5 percent.
   ``I can't assault them right now for this,'' Bush said in an
interview with ABC News' ``Business World,'' scheduled to be aired
Sunday. ``You've got to find the right mix'' to prevent inflation
or high interest rates from gaining the upper hand, he said.
   In raising the rate that usually provides a bellwether for other
rates throughout the economy, the Fed said it was acting to keep
the lid on inflation.
   A transcript of the taped interview was released Thursday by the
network.
   On another subject, Bush broke with the Reagan administration
and voiced support for the recommendation of a commission headed by
New York investment banker Nicholas Brady that a single agency _
preferably the Fed _ be given authority over financial markets.
   Brady, a close friend of Bush's, was selected by Reagan last
week to succeed James A. Baker III as treasury secretary. However,
the White House never has endorsed the findings of his report on
the Oct. 19 stock market crash.

   About 400 uniformed workers from the
state-run railway marched through the streets Friday to demand
higher wages and overtime pay.
   The workers from Taiwan Railway Administration handed a petition
to Communications Ministry officials.
   A spokesman for the workers, Yang Ching-chang, said the railway
company should raise their salaries and immediately make overtime
payments owed to the workers. The workers did not say how much more
they want.
   After a one-day strike by conductors in May that halted rail
service throughout the island, the railway had promised to make the
overtime payments over a four-year period.
   Railway workers earn an average of about $700 a month.
   Taiwan legalized strikes in June but banned strikes without the
authorization of labor associations.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa on Friday
laid a wreath at a monument to fallen shipyard workers in a
ceremony marking the eighth anniversary of strikes that launched
the now-outlawed independent trade union.
   A Solidarity spokeswoman said about 2,000 shipyard workers and
other Solidarity supporters attended the ceremony near the entrance
to the Lenin shipyard.
   The crowd chanted Solidarity slogans, waved banners and sang the
national anthem, said Joanna Wojciechowiz.
   Walesa, wearing a Solidarity T-shirt, helped put wreaths and
flowers on the monument, erected to honor striking shipyard workers
killed by security forces during labor unrest in 1970.
   The ceremony was held two days before the official 1980 strike
anniversary, which falls on a Sunday this year, to allow more
workers to attend, said the Solidarity spokeswoman.
   On Aug. 14, 1980, workers in the Lenin shipyards in Gdansk began
a strike over reinstating a fired crane operator. Two days later
the demands grew to include an independent trade union, and
Solidarity was born.
   The union at its peak claimed about 10 million members, or
nearly one-third of the nation's population.
   The union was crushed when martial law was imposed in 1981. It
was banned by parliament the next year.
   Police watched the ceremony but did not intervene, witnesses
said.

   Former conservative Prime Minister Kaare
Willoch announced Friday he won't run for parliament again in next
year's election.
   Willoch, 59, has been a member of the 157-seat Storting for 32
years and served as prime minister from October 1981 to May 1987.
He is chairman of the constitutional and foreign affairs committee.
   Willoch, who failed in a bid last year for appointment as
secretary general of the NATO alliance, said in a letter to his
party: ``Should I do something else the rest of my active
professional life, it has to happen now.''
   Willoch was expected to seek the position as Oslo county
governor, which falls vacant next year.
   Einar Foerde, the deputy chairman of the ruling Labor Party,
also announced his decision not to run again, enabling him to apply
for the job as general manager of Norsk Rikskringkasting, the
national radio and television company.
   Foerde, 45, has been in the Storting since 1969 and is Labor's
floor leader.

<HEAD>2,000 Rally Against U.S. Bases</HEAD>

   About 2,000 students and some Roman
Catholic nuns chanting slogans denouncing the ``U.S.-Aquino
regime'' marched to an U.S. air base Friday to demand American
military facilities be closed.
   About 120 Filipino riot police guarded the main gate to Clark
Air Base as the protesters arrived from a church-run school two
miles away.
   The demonstrators included delegations from Manila, 50 miles to
the south. The group was to hold a similar protest Saturday outside
Subic Bay Naval Base, 30 miles southwest of Angeles.
   The U.S. military TV station, the Far East Network-Philippines,
warned viewers of the rally and urged American military personnel
to use other routes to avoid the protest.
   Clark and Subic are the largest American bases outside the
United States. About 40,000 U.S. service personnel, Defense
Department civilians and military dependents are stationed at
Clark, Subic and four smaller installations.
   Also on Friday, Capt. Douglas J. Katz, commander of the
battleship USS New Jersey, told reporters at Subic that the U.S.
Navy could relocate its facilities but hoped such a time would not
come.
   He said Subic was ``the finest base in the Pacific, and it would
be a loss'' to the Navy if the lease on U.S. military facilities in
the Philippines is not renewed when it expires in 1991.
   President Corazon Aquino is under pressure not to renew the 1947
bases agreement. She has agreed to honor the lease through 1991 but
refuses to say if she would support an extension.
   U.S. and Filipino panels have been negotiating for more than
four months on terms that should apply during the agreement's last
two years.
   According to sources close to the talks, Mrs. Aquino's
government is demanding compensation for the bases be increased to
$1.2 billion annually. The Americans now provide $180 million a
year in military and economic aid for continued use of the bases.
   The sources said the Americans are not willing to pay such a
drastic increase in compensation without assurances that the bases
will be allowed to remain beyond 1991.
   Speeches and slogans during Friday's rally accused Mrs. Aquino
of subservience to the Americans and said she already has secretly
agreed to extend the agreement.
   ``The truth is the Philippine government is ready to give the
Americans what they want in exchange for a big amount of money,''
said Elmo Manapat, a leader of the Nuclear-Free Philippines
Coalition.
   Zenaida Uy, secretary general of the left-leaning New Patriotic
Alliance, accused Mrs. Aquino of selling out Philippine sovereignty.
   In Cebu, the military's Visayas Command said Communist
guerrillas ambushed a patrol on Negros Island, wounding five
soldiers.
   The command said rebel fire also damaged three helicopters which
were flying in reinforcements after the clash in the mountains near
the Negros coastal town of Guihulngan, 350 miles southeast of
Manila.
   No rebel casualties were reported.
   The guerrillas have waged a 19-year insurgency to establish a
Marxist state.

   With Vice President George Bush promising he
won't name his running mate until next week's Republican
convention, the field of potential candidates shrunk today when
Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson said he had withdrawn from
consideration.
   Thompson said he called Bush this morning and said he didn't
want to be considered further because of the potential impact the
job would have on his family. He had been one of more than a dozen
people contacted as a possible running mate with Bush.
   Earlier, California Gov. George Deukmejian also had taken
himself out the running.
   ``The vice president's job requies a lot of national and
international travel,'' Thompson said at a news conference in
Springfield, Ill. ``My wife couldn't travel with me because I've
got a 10-year-old in school, and that's not true of the other
candidates.''
   Meanwhile, Bush's staff debated the best way to orchestrate the
announcement of Bush's running mate.
   Originally, Bush had planned to keep the name a secret until
next Thursday, the final day of the convention. However, his aides
now fear that would steal too much thunder from Bush's acceptance
speech, which is on the same day, so they are considering moving
the announcement up to Wednesday.
   ``Obviously, a consideration is a desire to maximize the
suspense factor,'' said a senior Bush campaign aide, speaking on
condition of anonymity. On the other hand, there is a rule that you
``don't step on other relatively good stories'' such as the
Thursday night speech.
   Another campaign official, also speaking anonymously, said there
was ``a lot of pressure to look at Wednesday'' for an announcement.
   In any event, one of the aides said, Bush is ``enjoying this
whole thing'' as suspense mounts over his choice.
   ``There won't be any leaks of this one because I'm not gonna
tell a soul and I haven't so far,'' Bush said in a CBS-TV
interview. He said some stories on the subject are ``close to
accurate and some of them are 180 degrees wrong.''
   Private polls conducted by Bush's campaign indicate that Sen.
Bob Dole of Kansas would give him more of a boost than any others
in contention for the No. 2 spot, but ``not enough to make much of
a difference,'' said one aide.
   A ticket of Bush and Bob Dole ran stronger than a hypothetical
ticket of Bush and Dole's wife, former Transportation Secretary
Elizabeth Dole, sources said.
   ``I don't think there is anybody under consideration who
guarantees (a Bush victory in) any state or region,'' said Roger
Stone, a Republican consultant with ties to the Bush campaign. As
for the timing of the announcement, Stone said, ``I don't think it
makes a whole lot of difference.''
   Bush, at an appearance with black supporters Thursday, declined
to say whether he was considering Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell, the
first black ever to hold the post of national security adviser.
   Powell has been suggested by several newspaper columns and has
been backed by Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y.
   People who were contacted by Bush, and asked to provide
financial data, include both Doles, Kemp, and Sens. Pete Domenici
of New Mexico, Dan Quayle of Indiana and Alan Simpson of Wyoming,
according to campaign aides.
   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, rumored to be under
consideration, said on national television she wasn't interested in
the job.
   Govs. George Deukmejian of California, Jim Thompson of Illinois,
John Sununu of New Hampshire, Carroll Campbell of South Carolina
and former governor Lamar Alexander of Tennessee were also among
those on the original list of those under consideration, the aides
said. Deukmejian has since withdrawn his name from consideration.
   Sources suggested that no polling had been done on Domenici,
suggesting that he may no longer be under active consideration.
   Meanwhile, Kemp said he has no expectations that he'll get
picked, and is ``not sitting by the telephone'' waiting to be
asked. But he said he would, naturally, jump at the job.
   Quayle said he, too, would accept an offer.
   Moreover, Quayle said his inclusion on Bush's list is not a
political favor to focus attention on Indiana's junior senator.
   `I don't think that's the case,'' he said. ``The answer is no.
N-O. Capital N-O,'' he said.

<HEAD>Joint India-U.S. Army Team to Attempt Himalayan Peak</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A joint team of military personnel from
the United States and India will try to scale a mountain peak in
the Himalayas next month, expedition leaders said Friday.
   Maj. H.S. Chauhan, the leader of the Indian delegation, told a
news conference the expedition would assault the 23,860-foot Mana
peak in the second or third week of September, depending on the
weather.
   The two countries will send 13 men each on the expedition. The
Indian side comprises army men, while the U.S. delegation consists
of 11 Army officers and two from the Air Force.
   The peak, about 210 miles northeast of New Delhi in the state of
Uttar Pradesh, has been climbed only three times. The expedition
will try the climb from the southern side of the mountain, Chauhan
said.
   He said the climbers will have to negotiate a 1.2-mile-long
glacier before scaling the northwestern ridge. ``And that's a
razor-sharp ridge,'' he added.
   The last 4,950 feet to the summit will have to be attempted on a
fixed rope, Chauhan said.
   Chief Warrant Officer Robert Wood, the leader of the U.S. team,
said his squad was looking forward to the adventure.
   ``The Himalayas are acknowledged as the ultimate goal of all
mountaineers,'' he said. ``We hope to see significantly higher
altitudes than in other continents.''
   The team is the first to be sent to the Himalayas from the U.S.
military.
   The Indian army, which regularly sends expeditions to the
Himalayas, has collaborated on climbs with British and French army
teams in the past two years.

   If it's Tuesday, this must be the day to water
your lawn _but only if you live in a home with an odd-numbered
address or you own a business. Got it straight?
   Don't feel too bad if you don't, for Reno's new water
conservation ordinance even tripped up Mayor Pete Sferrazza, and he
voted for the thing.
   Sferrazza, who lives at an even-numbered address, sprinkled his
lawn on Tuesday and Thursday this week instead of on Wednesday and
Saturday as required under the ordinance. His neighbors were only
too happy to report him.
   The mayor said a Reno nursery had installed a sprinkler system
in his yard and he assumed it was adjusted to water on the allowed
days.
   ``I've got to change my timer,'' Sferrazza said Thursday. ``I
can change it today. In any event, I'll take care of it.''
   Westpac Utilities spokeswoman Bonnie Saviers said the mayor
isn't the only one confused by the irrigation schedule. Questions
to her office have doubled since the ordinance went into effect
Monday, she said.
   Under the rules, even numbered addresses may water on Wednesdays
and Saturdays, odd numbered addresses on Thursdays and Sundays,
businesses on Tuesdays and Fridays and no one on Mondays.

   Speedy swine with names like Fried Bacon,
Alberto Clipper, New Deal Charlie and Joan Jett hoofed it toward
the finish line at the Ohio State Fair, but when it was all over
the porker in the winner's circle was Turbo Pig.
   ``He's just a really fast pig,'' said Amy Herbkersman of
Collins, who took home $234 for T.P.'s winning race Thursday. ``I
give him really good feed, but I don't train him much. He's just
feisty and fast.''
   Not as fast as last year's winner, though: Turbo Pig's winning
time was 3.9 seconds, well off the 2.7-second record set in 1987 by
Squealing Demon.
   The fair's 10th annual pig race drew 15 contestants.
   Ms. Herbkersman said her family racing team got into racing by
mistake.
   ``I found out about an offer to get a free pig,'' she said. ``I
didn't realize that one condition of accepting the pig was to race
it. But now my family and I caught the bug and we love it.''

   Sein Lwin resigned Friday after 17 days
as leader of Burma and the focus of a bloody popular uprising
against 26 years of repression, economic ruin and isolation imposed
by a socialist military regime.
   His government acknowledged 95 people were killed during a week
of violence in which soldiers regularly opened fire on unarmed
protesters, many of them high school students or Buddhist monks.
Diplomats in Rangoon say hundreds were killed and some estimates
surpass 1,000.
   Reports from Burma indicated security forces in at least two
towns had sided with the protesters, and a guerrilla leader waging
his own war against the government called for a coordinated
nationwide offensive to support them.
   Rangoon radio said Sein Lwin resigned as president of Burma and
head of its only political party, but it did not announce a
successor or say why he stepped down. The radio said People's
Assembly and the Central Committee of the Burma Socialist Program
Party would met next Friday.
   Josef Silverstein, a leading American expert on Burma, said by
telephone that a likely candidate to succeed Sein Lwin was Kyaw
Htin, a relatively liberal military officer. Kyaw Htin, who
received some military training in the United States, has been No.
3 in the government and party.
   Sein Lwin, 64, was elected president and party chief July 26
after the resignation of Ne Win, who had held power since a coup in
1962 and applied economic policies that made this potentially
affluent nation one of the world's poorest.
   Students, monks, workers and other filled the streets of Rangoon
almost immediately, demanding Sein Lwin's ouster. They blamed the
former general for brutally crushing student demonstrations in
March and June, and cited his bloody suppression of Rangoon
University riots after the coup.
   Demonstrators recited chants and waved placards calling him
``dog, a butcher, a Nazi.''
   The protests spread to two dozen other cities, and the killing
began Tuesday.
   Western diplomats who estimated the death toll in the hundreds
said no firm information was available because of the chaos and
because of a ``battle for the bodies'' between soldiers and
protesters.
   ``When someone is killed (the protesters) try to get it, so they
can display the bodies, and the government tries to get it to
cremate it'' and destroy evidence of of deaths, one said.
   Friday's broadcast by the official radio said the capital ``has
been peaceful since last night and law and order was maintained. .
.. There were almost no demonstrations or violence. The people of
the whole city of Rangoon are making preparations to protect
against looting.''
   It said about 1,000 gathered near a pagoda Friday in the Rangoon
suburb of North Okkalapa but dispersed. Thousands of people were
said to have fought and trapped soldiers in the suburb in the
previous two days.
   Japan's Kyodo news agency said soldiers had retained positions
around three barricaded ``liberated zones'' in North Okalappa and
two other suburbs but were seen leaving after Sein Lwin's
resignation was announced.
   Brang Seng, head of the Kachins and a leader of a 10-group
guerrilla coalition, called for an offensive ``from north to
south,'' to draw soldiers from two dozen towns and cities where
they blocked protests.
   A spokesman for Brang Seng quoted a statement as saying rebels
would attack government troops but also urging soldiers to join the
fight ``for peace and democracy.'' The spokesman, who would not
give his name, read the statement by telephone in Bangkok.
   Many ethnic rebel groups have fought since independence and
control vast areas of Burma, a nation of 38 million people about
the size of Texas.
   Tourists arriving in Bangkok said some shops reopened Friday and
some buses were running in Rangoon, which has been under martial
law and an 8 p.m.-4 a.m. curfew. Protesters have destroyed
streetlights in the city and burned buildings, houses and police
stations.
   About 200 soldiers and 100 policemen stayed indoors at Victoria
Point in Burma's southernmost province of Megui while 2,000
protesters marched for a third straight day Friday, a Thai official
said.
   Chalerm Supamorn, governor of Ranong province bordering Megui,
said the checkpoint had been closed Wednesday at the request of
Burmese authorities who feared people would cross the frontier to
incite protesters.
   Rangoon radio denied on Friday that protesters controlled
Victoria Point, a prosperous market town of 5,000 people 500 miles
southeast of Rangoon.
   Kyodo, quoting sources it did not identify, reported from
Rangoon on Thursday that protesters occupied government offices in
Pegu, 45 miles northeast of Rangoon. A Western diplomat said
demonstrators roamed freely in Pegu and the army took no action.
   Numerous less reliable reports spoke of military disaffection in
other areas.
   The Japanese agency quoted Rangoon sources Friday as saying
soldiers and demonstrators fought at Moulmein, 100 miles southeast
of the capital. Diplomats had reported harsh suppression of large
demonstrations there and Burmese media said mobs attacked a police
station.

   President Reagan traded compliments with
George Bush in a campaign pep talk Friday to top administration
officials, and predicted Americans won't ``gamble their future on a
blind date'' in the November election.
   ``We're going to hold the White House with George Bush,'' Reagan
declared to about 250 Cabinet and other top administration
officials in a spirited pre-convention sendoff for Bush next door
to the White House.
   Bush, noting that many of the officials would be on the campaign
trail on his behalf as surrogate speakers this fall, said they must
persuade voters that ``not just one election but ... a way of
life'' is at stake.
   ``I need you to march to victory again in November,'' Bush told
the group of officials he called the ``field commanders of the
Reagan revolution.''
   He told them a victory by his Democratic rival, Michael Dukakis,
would ``totally reverse'' the ``successes of this administration.''
   It was Bush's last scheduled campaign event before he goes to
New Orleans next Tuesday. He will appear again with Reagan at an
airport rally there before he is formally installed as his party's
presidential nominee at the Republican National Convention.
   In the meantime, Bush will continue working on his acceptance
speech and make his final decision on a running mate _ although he
has repeatedly said he'll try to keep his choice secret until the
convention is well under way.
   Reagan, who spoke after Bush, told his audience: ``Some people
may cast their vote this year to thank us for the last eight years.
But I suspect most people will vote for George Bush this year
bcause, after voting for him once or twice before, they know he's
their guarantee that peace and prosperity today will be followed by
peace and prosperity tomorrow.''
   ``And frankly,'' Reagan continued, ``I don't think the American
people want to gamble their future on a blind date.''
   It was the first time the two had spoken together in a public
political setting since Reagan's endorsement of Bush last May 11 at
a Republican fund-raising dinner _ an appearance in which the
president barely mentioned his vice president's name.
   However, if that endorsement struck many as lukewarm, the
president made up for it in Friday's rally in which he frequently
mentioned Bush as his partner in ``a great and continuing success
story.''
   He referred to himself and Bush as ``the malaise busters'' who
brought ``eight years of steady change, change for the better''
after the administration of Democrat Jimmy Carter.
   ``There's no way that America will turn back now,'' Reagan said.
   ``George Bush's policies work. The other folks talk, George Bush
will deliver,'' Reagan told cheering officials.
   ``Who's tending the store?'' Reagan jokingly asked the gathering
of senior administration officials. ``Welcome to the White House
complex,'' he said. ``White House complex _ that's what our
opponents have after eight years of being out of power.''
   The president said he would be ``crisscrossing America this
fall'' for Bush's candidacy.
   He also said his own agenda was ``still full,'' and he called
for congressional action on a U.S.-Canada free trade bill,
administration-backed welfare legislation, new aid for Contra
forces in Nicaragua and a defense bill that supports his Star Wars
Strategic Defense Initiative.
   ``We've got five full months ahead of us. We're going to
continue to advance our programs and policies until we cross the
finish line next January,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan handed Bush a gavel at the conclusion of his speech,
saying, ``I figure that with the convention coming up ... you can
probably use that gavel. If not there, from experience I can tell
you there will be a lot of meetings with the congressional
leadership when you can use that.''
   The meeting was attended by Cabinet and sub-Cabinet officials
who are exempt from a federal prohibition on campaigning that
applies to lower-level federal bureaucrats.
   Bush said he was ``proud to be a part of this administration,
proud to serve this president.''
   ``We all know what will kill, definitively kill, this economic
expansion we've worked so hard to create,'' he said. ``Those same
Democrats, the McGovern or Carter or Mondale Democrats, are just
itching to get their hands back on the levers that you operate so
ably.''

<HEAD>Hunters Roust Grouse On Glorious Twelfth</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hunters flocked to the heather-covered moors of
Scotland and northern England on Friday, ``The Glorious Twelfth of
August'' and the start of the grouse-hunting season popular with
landed gentry and wealthy tourists.
   But the hunters' gunfire was muted by declining stocks of the
wild red grouse, due to a parasite and vigorous protesters who
drove the birds away with a pre-dawn swoop on three grouse moors.
   The Hunt Saboteurs Association, which opposes blood sports, said
about 300 members beat the hunters to the bushes and rousted the
grouse at Stanhope and Gunnerside Moors in northern England and in
an area near Muirshell Country Park in Scotland.
   Ben Ponton, a spokesman for the protesters, said they would
remain on the moors all day. He described their early success as
the ``most glorious day'' in efforts to ban grouse-killing.
   ``It has become a `Glorious Twelfth,''' he said. ``We've saved
birds lives and that's glorious.''
   Dukes and lords traditionally lead hunting parties on ``The
Glorious Twelfth of August'' _ not to be confused with ``The
Glorious Twelfth of July,'' when Protestants in Northern Ireland
celebrate their victory over Roman Catholics in the Battle of the
Boyne.
   London restaurants, which used to hire helicopters, race-car
drivers and airplanes in an informal competition to whisk the first
grouse from the north to their tables, have toned down the
publicity stunts, partly because of the protests.
   ``I think over the last few years there has been very bad
press,'' said a spokesman for the Hilton International Hotel on
London's fashionable Park Lane, which ordered 10 grouse to serve
Friday night. ``As a result, a lot of hotels have not done as much
promotion.''
   Gourmets have always turned up their noses at the competition,
insisting grouse should hang for four r five days to bring out
their true gamey taste.
   The Ritz Hotel in London's Piccadilly area said grouse would be
on its menu Friday night for about $60 a plate, but ``it will be at
its best next week.''
   ``Most of our clients prefer it after its been hung for about a
week,'' a spokeswoman said.
   Passengers on Dan Air's 6:50 a.m. flight from Inverness,
Scotland, to London's Heathrow Airport were among the first to
taste this year's grouse.
   Grouse shot on a Scottish estate before dawn was cooked at the
Golsview Hotel in Nairn, driven to Inverness Airport four miles
away and served on board.
   The palatial Gleneagles Hotel in eastern Scotland, traditionally
one of the front-runners in the grouse-serving race, abstained for
the fourth successive year because of the serious grouse decline,
said general manager Peter Lederer.
   ``We feel we should do everything possible to preserve
Scotland's great sporting traditions in the interests of tourism as
a whole and for environmental and ecological reasons in
particular,'' he said.
   Scotland's Game Conservancy says the grouse population has
fallen steadily since the mid-1970s because of disease and because
their native habitats have been taken over as farmland.
   Grouse hunting is particularly popular among Britain's landed
gentry, and estate owners charge foreign tourists several hundred
dollars a day to shoot on their land.
   John Sheard, agent for the Duke of Devonshire's northern England
estate at Bolton Abbey, said propects for this year's grouse were
``not too good'' because a parasitic worm called the Strongyle has
weakened the stock.
   A Conservative lawmaker said the grouse season is also
threatened by a European Economic Community proposal which would
require that every bird in its member countries be inspected by a
veterinarian within 48 hours of death. The proposal is an effort to
ensure that wild animals used for food are healthy.
   The vet would need to remove the feathers and gut the bird, not
only delaying its passage to the dinner table but making it
impossible to hang game in a traditional way.
   ``Such an order is fatuous, dictatorial, militaristic, idiotic
and totally unacceptable to Great Britain or to sportsmen or to
anybody who has the brains of a grouse,'' said Sir Nicholas
Fairbairn, Conservative member of Parliament for Perth and Kinross
in Scotland.

<TEXT>
   Gov. James R. Thompson withdrew from
consideration Friday as a possible running mate for George Bush,
saying the vice presidency would place too much strain on his
family.
   ``I talked to the family about it and I now believe that at this
moment in the time of Jim Thompson and his family, it's not the
right thing to do,'' the Republican governor told reporters before
a speech at the Illinois State Fair.
   Thompson said he received background questionnaires from the
Bush campaign on Monday, but called the vice president Friday
morning and said he didn't want to be considered further.
   ``The vice president's job requires a lot of national and
international travel,'' he said. ``My wife couldn't travel with me
because I've got a 10-year-old in school, and that's not true of
the other candidates.''
   Thompson, 52, had said previously he didn't expect to be asked
by Bush.
   The governor also has also been mentioned for attorney general
in a Bush administration, but he said Friday he believes such an
appointment is unlikely.
   He noted that former Pennsylvania Gov. Richard Thornburgh was
confirmed Thursday as attorney general, replacing Edwin Meese III,
and indicated he believes Thornburgh will remain in the post if
Bush wins in November.

   A federal judge will review an order that
sealed search warrant affidavits used to seize materials from
Unisys Corp. as part of a national investigation into Pentagon
procurement practices.
   U.S. District Judge Diana Murphy is expected to issue a decision
within two weeks.
   She acted Thursday at the request of attorneys for the Star
Tribune and St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch, which are appealing
U.S. Magistrate Earl Cudd's decision last month to grant the
government's request to seal the search records.
   They argumed the records should be released under the First
Amendment.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Vosepka countered that releasing
the search warrants and affidavits could jeopardize the government
investigation.
   Federal agents seized records at Unisys offices in Eagan on June
14 as part of an investigation into allegations of fraud and
bribery among defense officials, consultants and contractors.
   W. Michael Blumenthal, chairman and chief executive of Unisys
Corp., said Wednesday that an internal investigation was almost
complete and further action to eliminate questionable practices was
likely.
   The company is based in Blue Bell, Pa., but has substantial
operations in Minnesota.

<HEAD>Wholesale Prices Increased at Near 6 Percent Annual Rate in July</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wholesale prices rose at a brisk annual rate
of 5.7 percent in July despite smaller increases for food, the
government said Friday in a report that intensified already
deepening concerns about inflation.
   The Labor Department said its Producer Price Index, which tracks
prices for finished products one step before the retail level, rose
0.5 percent last month, compared with a 0.4 percent increase in
June.
   But what alarmed analysts most about the July report was that,
unlike previous months, the biggest increases were not in the
normally highly volatile food and energy sectors but across a wide
spectrum of consumer and capital goods.
   Drugs, men's clothing, tires, soaps, cosmetics, home electronic
equipment, glassware, tobacco products and construction equipment
all rose at annualized inflation rates in the double digits. In the
past two months alone, auto prices have climbed more than 1.5
percent, close to double digits if annualized.
   ``These prices will slow down, but something else ... will pick
up the slack,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of economic
forecasting at Georgia State University. ``There's a lot of
inflation kicking around.''
   Ratajczak said the August figures when they come out next month
will look even worse. He predicted a monthly increase of 0.6
percent or annual rate exceeding 7 percent as energy prices rebound
and the impact of the Farm Belt drought wends its way through the
food production process.
   Consumer food prices on the wholesale level rose just 0.4
percent in July. The price decline was led by falling meat costs as
drought-plagued farmers and ranchers rushed their herds to
slaughter rather than continue feeding them high-cost grains.
   The 0.4 percent gain compared with increases of 1.1 percent in
June and 0.9 percent in May.
   I July, beef prices dropped 2.5 percent; pork plummeted 10.5
percent; and fish prices edged down 0.7 percent.
   Prices for other food products affected by the drought, such as
fruits and poultry products, continued to rise but at a slower pace
than in June.
   Prices for fresh vegetables jumped 7.5 percent after declining
5.7 percent in June, and canned fruits and vegetables rose 1.3
percent, triple the rate of increase the previous month.
   ``The drought is still not a major factor at the finished goods
level, but it will be,'' Ratajczak said. ``That's what's worrisome.
Peas are in trouble, corn's in trouble, and that is why you seen
these canned goods beginning to take off.''
   However, he said the effect of the dry weather on consumer
prices overall for the year will be only about one-half of 1
percent.
   On Thursday, the Agriculture Department said consumer food
prices alone will be pushed about 1 percent higher than they would
have been had it not been for the drought.
   Energy prices, after dropping 1.6 percent in June, were stable
last month as a 3 percent increase in the wholesale price for
gasoline was offset by a 6.1 percent decline in home heating oil
prices.
   In a related report on the inflationary front, the Commerce
Department reported Friday that business inventories rose 0.7
percent in June despite a 1.5 percent increase in sales.
   ``We're beginning to see some inventory buying as an inflation
hedge,'' said Allen Sinai of the Boston Co., a New York economic
consultant. ``When that happens, it just adds to inflationary
pressures. It's the old too many dollars chasing too few goods.''
   The June inventories plus the higher wholesale prices in July
suggest that the economy is ``racheting up to a new higher plateau
of inflation _ 5 percent to 6 percent at an annual rate _ a good
deal sooner than 1989, as most had expected,'' he said.
   Based on Friday's wholesale price data, Sinai said he was
revising his earlier prediction of consumer inflation in July from
an annual rate of about 5 percent upward to about 6 percent. The
Labor Department's report on July consumer prices will be published
Aug. 23.
   President Reagan's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said that
despite Friday's report, officials at the White House ``still
believe inflation remains low and under control.''
   Fitzwater had said earlier this week that administration
officials were ``disappointed'' that the Federal Reserve Board had
boosted the interest rate charged banks from 6 percent to 6.5
percent in an effort to stem inflationary pressures.
   However, other private analysts who once shared the
administration's view that inflation is not a serious problem yet
said they were alarmed by the July wholesale price report.
   ``There's no way of sugarcoating it _ the report was disturbing
because the big increases in prices were outside food and energy,''
said Larry Chimerine, president of the Wefa Group, an economic
consultant in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   ``It certainly makes what the Fed did earlier this week look a
little bit more prudent,'' Chimerine said. ``The report somewhat
overstates the underlying rate of inflation, but clearly it is
getting worse.''

   British diplomat David Reddaway said Friday
he will talk to Iranian officials about foreign hostages held in
Lebanon by pro-Iranian extremists.
   Reddaway, arriving for what he said was a two-week stay, would
not say which officials he planned to see Saturday.
   The state-run Islamic Republic News Agency said Reddaway would
hold talks on ``mutual relations'' during a short visit. It did not
elaborate.
   Before leaving London, Reddaway said he would speak with
officials about the 18 hostages, who include Anglican envoy Terry
Waite, two other Britons and nine Americans.
   ``I think it is bound to help,'' Reddaway said. ``The main thing
I will be able to do is to remind the Iranian government ... that
we would hope that any government that could influence people
holding hostages would do so.''
   Several of the missing foreigners in Lebanon are believed to be
held by a pro-Iranian group of Shiite Moslem extremists called
Hezbollah, or Party of God. Tehran wields considerable influence
over the faction. No group has claimed responsibility for
kidnapping the three Britons.
   In addition to Waite, Britain seeks the release of journalist
John McCarthy and teacher Brian Keenan, a Belfast man with dual
British and Irish nationality whose release is also sought by the
Irish government.
   The Foreign Office says it also seeks word on Alec Collett, a
New York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claim
they killed him. His body was never found.
   Reddaway is a first secretary at the Foreign Office. While
stationed in Tehran in 1980, he helped Britons escape from the
besieged British Embassy.
   IRNA said he speaks fluent Farsi and has an Iranian-born wife.
His visit was not mentioned on the evening radio and television
news programs.
   Iran has been making conciliatory statements about relations
with Western nations since it announced July 18 it was accepting a
U.N. call for a cease-fire in its 8-year-old war with Iraq.
   Iran's only representative in Britain, Charge d'Affaires
Mohammed Basti, said the hostage issue could be solved if all sides
showed good will, and his embassy announced it was sincerely trying
to help.
   A British official source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Basti has been told repeatedly that if Iran is in a position
to get freedom for the 18 foreign hostages in Lebanon, it should do
so on humanitarian grounds.
   ``In a way this a very blatant admission (of involvement),'' the
source said.
   He stressed the government would make no deals with Iran and was
not involved with the Church of England talks. ``There is no change
and can be no change in our position that there will no deals.''
   Iran also said it appreciated the efforts of Archbishop of
Canterbury Robert Runcie, who met in London on Wednesday with a
representative of the Iranian Foreign Ministry from Tehran.
   Church of England representatives met again Friday with the
official, Mohamed Reza Said Mohamedi.
   In July, an Anglican bishop went to Lebanon to initiate
inquiries among Christians about the fate of four Iranians who were
believed kidnapped by Christians in Lebanon. Iran has repeatedly
sought information on the four.
   Waite disappeared in Lebanon in January 1987 while trying to
secure the release of American hostages.
   The longest-held hostage is American Terry Anderson, 40, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was seized
March 16, 1985.
   Relations between Britain and Iran have improved markedly in
recent weeks.
   Britain closed its embassy and withdrew the ambassador from
Tehran in 1980 after Revolutionary Guards stormed the building,
denouncing Britain as an ally of the United States.
   Last summer, Britain withdrew all its diplomats, who worked out
of the Swedish Embassy in Tehran, and virtually broke diplomatic
relations.
   The move came after a British diplomat was detained and beaten
in apparent reprisal for British police arresting an Iranian envoy
on shoplifting charges.
   On Thursday, the English-language Tehran Times said
``speculation looms large'' that Reddaway will visit Briton Roger
Cooper, held in Iran on espionage charges.
   Cooper, 52, a nephew of the late British poet and novelist
Robert Graves, was arrested in December 1985 and held in Tehran's
Evin prison.
   The newspaper said with the arrival of Reddaway, ``Britain took
a giant stride in expansion of bilateral ties with Iran.''

   Singer Anne Murray has an unwelcome
admirer _ a farmer who's convinced that the Canadian-born
entertainer is in love with him and has been jailed for harassing
her.
   Robert Kieling, 52, is seeking to be released from jail until
his appeal of a six-month sentence is heard. He argued in court
Thursday that he should be let out on bail to harvest his grain
crop.
   Kieling believes Murray is in love with him and has been
convicted 11 times since 1980 for bothering her. He's under a court
order not to contact her or any members of her family.
   His most recent conviction for breaching the order came June 29
after he telephoned her office 263 times in the first six months of
this year. Crown attorney Alistair Johnston said the calls
continued right up until he was sent to jail.
   Kieling also was convicted for sending Murray a letter in
December asking her to come visit him by taking the train to
Saskatchewan from her hometown of Springhill, Nova Scotia.

   Bernardine Dohrn says she has few regrets about
her activist past, though she concedes the political movement of
the 1960s was occasionally fraught with ``arrogance, sexism and
racism.''
   ``I was determined not to be like my mother's generation,''
Dohrn, former leader of the Weather Underground and once listed on
the FBI's ``10 Most Wanted'' list, told an audience Thursday at the
downtown Cultural Center. She said she had wanted ``no marriage, no
children.''
   But Dohrn's views have mellowed since she spent 11 years in
hiding and served a seven-month prison term for refusing to
cooperate with a grand jury investigation of a 1981 Brink's armored
truck robbery in which three people were killed.
   Dohrn, 46, has married and has three children. She lives in
Chicago, working for children's welfare issues, with her husband,
William Ayers, also a onetime member of the Weather Underground who
is now a teacher of education at the University of Illinois at
Chicago.
   ``Remembering the past is a more revealing process than studying
the present,'' Dohrn told her audience. ``The appeal of the '60s
protest movement comes from a simple notion _ that what you do
makes a difference.''
   But Dohrn said radical movements she was involved in were often
``chaotic, inconsistent and messy.
   ``In our militancy and intensity, we somehow lost hold of what
brought us into the movement in the first place _ a spirit of unity
and democracy.''

   The former girlfriend of Boston Red Sox
star Wade Boggs struck out in court Friday when a commissioner
threw out her suit seeking $6 million compensation for four years
of part-time companionship.
   ``Score one for Wade Boggs,'' exulted Jennifer King, attorney
for the four-time American League batting champion.
   The suit by Margo Adams, 32, of Costa Mesa, sought $6 million in
punitive damages and compensation for lost wages for time she spent
on Sox road trips with Boggs, 30, who is married and has two
children.
   Orange County Superior Court Commissioner Eleanor Palk rejected
the suit as being improperly grounded in law, but left open the
possibility that it could be refiled if it is amended. Ms. Adams'
attorney, James McGee, said in court he intended to rewrite the
suit and refile it within 30 days.
   Neither Boggs nor Ms. Adams was in court.
   The suit contended that Boggs and Ms. Adams essentially lived
together during Red Sox road trips, and that by breaking off the
affair, Boggs broke an oral contract that called for her to provide
companionship.
   Ms. King argued that if such a contract existed, it necessarily
would have included sex. A contract for sex is illegal,
invalidating any legal claim by any party to such a contract, she
argued.
   The third-baseman has apologized to Deborah, his wife of 10
years and regrets the affair, Ms. King said.
   Boggs acknowledges taking Ms. Adams, identified by her attorney
as a mortgage broker, along on most of the team's road trips for
two years. But he broke off the affair two years ago, his lawyer
said.
   Ms. Adams is planning a ``kiss-and-tell'' book about the affair
and has signed a literary agent to try to sell the memoir to
publishers.

<HEAD>South Africa Considers Signing Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A South African delegation met with U.S.,
Soviet and British diplomats Friday about the possibility of
subscribing to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. No details
were disclosed.
   Under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,
which has been signed by 137 governments since its preparation in
1969, countries without such weapons open their nuclear facilities
to inspection by experts from the International Atomic Energy
Agency, a U.N. agency based in Vienna.
   Of the five acknowledged nuclear powers, the United States,
Soviet Union and Britain have signed but China and France have not.
   Also among the holdouts are countries believed either to possess
nuclear weapons or the potential of producing them, including
India, Pakistan, Israel and South Africa.
   A South African statement said the delegation was led by Foreign
Minister Roelof Botha and Energy Minister Danie Steyn.
   It said discussions covered ``the effect and interpretation of
the provisions of the NPT,'' a common official reference to the
treaty, and ``clarity was sought ... on the rights and privileges
which would apply should the Republic of South Africa accede to the
NPT.''
   The South African Broadcasting Corp. said Thursday delegation
would convey South Africa's willingness to open its nuclear
facilities to international inspection. In the past, South Africa
had refused to submit all its nuclear facilities to inspection by
the U.N. agency.
   South Africa is widely believed to have the technical capability
to produce nuclear weapons, but whether it possesses them has not
been established.
   A U.S. spokesman, Carl Stoiber, said concerns about its weapons
potential were raised in the discussions but gave not details.
   African and other third-world countries have repeatedly
attempted to have South Africa ousted as a member of the
International Atomic Energy Agency because of its refusal to sign
the treaty and its apartheid policy of racial segregation.

   PLO chief Yasser Arafat met met Libyan leader Col.
Moammar Gadhafi in Tripoli on Friday and discussed financial aid
for Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories, the official
Libyan news agency JANA said.
   Gadhafi said earlier this week that Libya would pay the salaries
of 21,200 Palestinian officials in the territories who previously
had been paid by Jordan.
   King Hussein of Jordan announced July 31 he was severing legal
and administrative links in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
essentially turning over responsibility to the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   JANA said Gadhafi and Arafat stressed the need for other Arab
countries to follow Libya's lead in providing financial support to
the Palestinians.
   An Israeli Foreign Ministry official said privately Thursday it
was ``very hypothetical'' whether Israel would allow another Arab
country to send money into the territories.
   Israel has imposed strict restrictions in the past to prevent
PLO funds from coming into the country.
   JANA, monitored in Rome, said Gadhafi and Arafat also focused on
the necessity of creating a Palestinian government-in-exile to rule
the occupied territories, captured by Israel from Jordan and Egypt
in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Israel has denounced the idea of a government-in-exile.

   Sikh separatists planted three time
bombs in two northern cities Friday, killing seven people and
injuring at least 37, police said.
   On Thursday, a gang believed to be upper-class Hindus attacked
two neighboring villages in the northeastern state of Bihar,
killing 11 Hindu untouchables, news reports said.
   A bomb placed on the roof of a state-owned bus went off 20
minutes after the vehicle left the bus terminal at Chandigarh,
killing seven people and injuring 35, said Police Chief Surinder
Singh Brar.
   In Jammu, the winter capital of Kashmir state, a bomb exploded
in a scooter rickshaw, injuring two people, said Police
Superintendent D.S. Salathia.
   Sikh militants also were blamed for placing a time bomb in the
most popular and crowded shopping center of Chandigarh, but the
device was detected and defused before it detonated.
   ``Another 15 minutes and it would have exploded,'' said
superintendent R.P. Singh. He said the device was detected after
someone reported seeing a suspicious canister with a watch attached
to it.
   Brar said a bomb exploded on a bus six miles south of Chandigarh
bound for the town of Shazadpur in neighboring Haryana state.
Chandigarh is the joint capital of Punjab and Haryana states.
   Sikhs form only 2 percent of India's 800 million people but form
a majority in Punjab. Radicals have been agitating for an
independent Sikh homeland in Punjab since 1982, claiming
discrimination by Hindus, who form 80 percent of the population.
The separatist campaign has killed 1,680 people this year.
   ``It was an encounter with death,'' said Yash Bir, a passenger
on the bus who suffered burn injuries in the explosion. ``I was
unconscious. I do not know who brought me to hospital.'' Bir spoke
to reporters from a bed in a Chandigarh hospital, where most of the
injured were taken.
   Doctors said five were in serious condition. The victims were
not immediately identified.
   Brar said the bomb was planted on the bus' rooftop luggage
carrier. About 70 passengers were in the vehicle.
   In other parts of Punjab, Sikh militants were blamed for five
other killings Thursday night and Friday, the United News of India
said.
   At least three victims were Sikhs, the news agency said. The
militants have targeted Hindus and moderate Sikhs in their campaign.
   The Press Trust of India news agency said at least two people
were seriously injured in the attack on untouchables in Bihar on
Thursday.
   No arrests were reported, but the killers are suspected to be
upper-class Hindus.
   More than 80 percent of India's 800 million people are Hindus,
who are mainly divided into four castes. Below the castes are the
Harijans or untouchables, the lowest group.
   Caste prejudices have lessened since India gained independence
in 1947, but divisions are more apparent in Bihar, the poorest
state in India.
   Prejudices often erupt into violence there because many
untouchables have joined Marxist groups that agitate for
distribution of land owned by upper-caste Hindus.

<HEAD>Scientists Fly to Moscow to Set Up Nuclear Test Station</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two British scientists flew to the Soviet Union on
Friday to set up the only independent foreign-run seismic
monitoring station of Soviet nuclear tests, a colleague said.
   Jonathan Doody and Paul Coward plan to set up the monitoring
center at Garm near the Afghan border and 800 miles south of the
main Soviet nuclear test site at Semipalatinsk, said Andrew Parker,
a scientist who works with Coward at Leicester University. Doody
works at Glasgow University in Scotland.
   They hope their tests will help bring about a comprehensive
nuclear test ban treaty by proving that it is possible to monitor
even small nuclear explosions, said Parker.
   Opponents of such a treaty say that it could not be verifiable
because they believe low-level nuclear explosions cannot always be
detected.
   Doody and Coward plan to be stationed at the Garm center for two
weeks, after which they will be replaced by other British
scientists, said Parker. The center will be open for a year.
   Although U.S. scientists have set up five seismic monitoring
centers in the Soviet Union, they are operated by Soviets.
   The British center will be created under an agreement between
the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the British Seismic Verification
Research Project, an independent group of scientists who want a
nuclear test ban treaty.

   Interest rates on new one-year,
adjustable-rate mortgages surged to the highest level in nine
months this week while fixed-rate mortgages jumped almost to the
high point for the year, according to a nationwide survey released
Friday.
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., a government-chartered
company owned by savings institutions and known as Freddie Mac,
said the one-year, adjustable-rate mortgages this week averaged
8.00 percent, up from 7.90 percent the week before. It was the
highest since rates averaged 8.11 percent the week ending Nov. 6.
   Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages jumped to 10.57 percent from
10.44 percent the previous week. That was just slightly below the
high for the year so far _ 10.58 percent _ the average for the
weeks ending May 27 and June 3.
   The jump in rates this week followed a move Tuesday by the
Federal Reserve Board to push up interest rates to slow the economy
and fight inflation.
   Economists predict a wide range of interest rates, including
mortgage rates, will increase further this year.
   Fixed-rate mortgages hit a peak just before the October stock
market crash of 11.58 percent. As the Fed pumped money into the
economy to avoid a recession, the average dropped to 9.84 percent
in early February.
   The increase since then means homebuyers taking out $100,000
mortgages now face about $670 more in annual costs than they would
have on a fixed-rate mortgage taken out six months ago.
   Thomas M. Holloway, senior economist for the Mortgage Bankers
Association of America, said fixed-rate mortgages likely will rise
another three-quarters of a percentage point by the end of the year.
   ``I think it's going to slow down the housing sector, but I
don't think this is the death of the industry,'' he said.
   Fixed-rate mortgages have fluctuated widely over the past
several years, depending on financial market assessment of
inflation dangers. But the one-year rate has stayed relatively low,
serving as an alternative for home buyers when fixed rates jump.
   However, adjustable rates now are also moving higher, reflecting
Federal Reserve tightening, which has a more immediate effect on
short-term rates than on long-term rates.
   In a separate report, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which
regulates federally insured savings institutions, said fixed-rate
mortgages declined slightly from 10.78 percent in early June to
10.73 percent in early July. The dip followed three consecutive
monthly increases.
   Unlike Freddie Mac averages, the bank board numbers include
add-on fees known as ``points.'' Also, the bank board averages do
no reflect changes over the past month.
   The bank board said rates, including points, for the most
popular type of one-year, adjustable-rate mortgages _ those with
caps on how high the rates can increase _ rose for the third month
in a row from 8.80 percent in early June to 8.86 percent in early
July.

   Angolan rebels killed 42 government
troops in three clashes this week, ignoring a cease-fire declared
by Angola, Cuba and South Africa in the 13-year Angolan war, the
group said Friday.
   Also on Friday, the official Angolan news agency said Angolan
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Cuban diplomat Jorge Risquet
met to discuss the cease-fire, which was declared Monday.
   The news agency ANGOP said the Thurdsay meeting in Luanda, the
Angolan capital, also covered several unspecified bilateral issues.
The report, distributed in Lisbon, did not elaborate.
   In a military statement distributed in Lisbon, the rebel Union
for the Total Independence of Angola said it killed 10 soldiers
Wednesday in an ambush on an Army battalion just northwest of
Kuemba in the central province of Bie.
   On Tuesday, rebels ambushed government troops on a road near
Tomboko in northwestern Zaire province, killing seven soldiers, the
statement said. It said rebels killed 25 more soldiers Monday in a
battle near Chipendo in the southwestern province of Huila.
   Two guerrillas died and nine others were injured in the clashes,
the statement said.
   There was no independent confirmation of the claims.
   The rebels, with the backing of South Africa and the United
States, have fought since 1975 to force the Cuban and Soviet-backed
Marxist government to share power in the former Portuguese colony.
They are not a party to the cease-fire.
   Monday's cease-fire was the first step in a three-way peace
agreement to end war in the region, achieve a withdrawal of Cuba's
50,000 troops in Angola and create an independent state in
neighboring South-West Africa, also known as Namibia, which now is
controlled by South Africa.
   Risquet is a member of the ruling Cuban Communist Party's
Politburo and headed Cuba's delegation to ongoing peace talks
between the three countries.
   Another round is set to be held later this month.
   The peace accord also calls for the eventual withdrawal of
Cuba's estimated 50,000 troops in Angola by a date still to be
negotiated.
   The rebels have demanded direct talks with the government.
Angola has rejected that.

<HEAD>Judge's Ruling Extends Amnesty Deadline For Thousands Of Aliens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has agreed to extend the
deadline for amnesty applications so that as many as 100,000
immigrants who failed to apply because of confusion over a
restriction can seek legalization.
   U.S. District Judge William D. Keller said at a hearing
Wednesday he would issue a formal ruling ordering the Immigration
and Naturalization Service to extend the amnesty program until Nov.
30 for one group of immigrants.
   His decision is aimed at immigrants, including large numbers of
Asians, Europeans and South Americans, who were rejected or
discouraged from applying because of an INS rule that initially
disqualified people who traveled outside the country after the
January 1982 amnesty-eligibility deadline and then re-entered with
legal visas.
   The INS rescinded the policy midway through the one-year amnesty
program.
   ``We believe that thousands of people never heard of the change
in INS policy and therefore did not apply for amnesty by the May 4,
1988, deadline,'' said Peter Schey, attorney for the National
Center for Immigrants Rights Inc., who filed the lawsuit last
summer.
   He estimates that the ruling could add as many as 100,000 new
amnesty applicants to the 1.8 million who applied before the first
phase of the program ended May 5.
   Government attorneys, who disputed Schey's numbers, said they
may appeal Keller's decision.
   The case is one of several court challenges seeking similar
extensions for different categories of immigrants who maintain they
were wrongly left out of the process.
   According to Schey, Keller's ruling is the first since June when
the Supreme Court ruled, in a case concerning Filipino World War II
veterans, against courts extending deadlines imposed by Congress.
   In a related case, a federal judge in Sacramento on Wednesday
reinstated an amnesty extension for immigrants who traveled outside
the United States during the amnesty application period without INS
permission.
   U.S. District Judge Lawrence Karlton had stayed an extension he
granted in June as a result of the Supreme Court ruling, Schey said.
   ``This court ruling says that despite that Supreme Court case,
the federal courts do have the power to extend the deadline,'' he
said.
   Government lawyers remain unconvinced, however.
   ``The INS position is that the court doesn't have the
jurisdiction to order this extension,'' said Assistant U.S.
Attorney George Wu, who represented the INS in the case.

<HEAD>Court Seeks Advice on Quickly Distributing Its Opinions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Friday invited various
organizations to propose ways in which to make the court's opinions
generally available nationwide the same day they are announced.
   James R. Donovan, the court's director of data systems, said the
court ``tentatively contemplates a one-to-three-year experiment,
with the period of review based in part on the outside entity's
investment.
   In a letter to legal publishers, legal research data base
providers and news wire services, Donovan invited ``preliminary
proposals'' but said the court reserves ``the right not to pursue
the project beyond the acceptance of preliminary proposals.''
   In making public a copy of Donovan's letter, court spokeswoman
Toni House called the solicitation of proposals a ``first step
toward making (the court's) opinions available via computer.''
   Donovan's letter said the court's evaluation of the proposals
would include, among others, these considerations:
   _Whether the opinions will be equally available to all
interested parties.
   _Whether a proposal favors or appears to favor one distributor
or group of distributors.
   _Whether the project would be conducted by a not-for-profit
organization or on a not-for-profit basis.
   _Whether the project would be conducted by a consortium of or as
a joint project of a number of interested parties.
   The court currently releases only printed copies of its opinions
on the day they are released from the bench. The court has no
method of general, same-day dissemination of its opinions beyond
Washington.
   Donovan said the move to computerized delivery of opinions is
being contemplated because ``the court recognizes its unique
position in the American judicial system and the unique nature of
its product.''

<HEAD>Getty Museum Pulls Disputed Sculptures From Exhibition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several pieces of sculpture on loan to the J.
Paul Getty Museum have been removed from display after an
investigator said they fit the descriptions of pieces stolen from
an excavation in Italy 10 years ago.
   Two marble heads and associated hands and feet were removed from
the museum's Magna Grecia gallery, museum spokeswoman Lori Starr
said Thursday.
   Earlier this week, Italian magistrate Silvio Raffiotta told the
Los Angeles Times he was investigating the theft of Greek sculpture
from an archaeological site in Morgantina, Sicily, and that he
believed pieces of stolen statuary _ a face, hands and feet _ had
turned up in the Getty Museum.
   ``No one has presented any evidence to us that they are from
Morgantina,'' Starr said. However, she said, the museum removed the
pieces because they may fit the description of objects allegedly
stolen from the Morgantina site.
   The museum does not own the pieces, Ms. Starr said, adding that
they have been on loan from a private collector and will be
returned to the collector.
   According to terms of the loan agreement, the museum cannot
reveal the lender's name, she said. Raffiotta has not indicated the
museum may have known the origin of the pieces.
   Last month, Graziella Fiorentini, director of antiquities in
Agrigento, Sicily, alleged that a fifth-century B.C. classical
Greek statue, believed to be that of the Greek goddess Aphrodite,
may have been illegally removed from Morgantina in 1979. Her
allegations have triggered an investigation by Italian authorities
and Interpol, the Paris-based international police agency.
   That 7{-foot statue, unveiled by Getty last month, is said to be
the only acrolithic figure that has survived relatively intact from
head to foot. Acrolithic figures are composed of separately carved
marble heads, hands and feet attached to limestone or wood bodies.
   Raffiotta, who is independently investigating the thefts, said
he does not believe the Aphrodite was removed from Morgantina, but
indicated that two other statues from Morgantina were on display at
the Getty. He described the allegedly stolen objects as pieces of
acrolithic statues.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Zaid Rifai met Friday with a
high-level PLO delegation to discuss Jordan's decision to cut
official ties with Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories.
   A senior PLO official said the talks centered on bilateral ties
in light of the recent Jordanian move and proposals for a
Palestinian government-in-exile, currently under discussion in the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   King Hussein two weeks ago severed legal and administrative ties
to the West Bank, which Jordan ruled from 1948 until 1967 when the
area was captured by Israel.
   State-run Jordan radio said only that Friday's meeting centered
``on issues of mutual concern.''
   The PLO official, who spoke on condition of anoymity, said the
two sides discussed the status of Jordanian passports held by
Palestinians, the rights of employees in the occupied territories
recently fired by Jordan and ``the implications of these measures
on the future of Palestinians.''
   Hussein has scrapped a $1.3 billion development plan for the
West Bank and Gaza strip, cancelled the salaries of 21,200 local
employees and dissolved the lower house of parliament, half of
whose 60 members represented the West Bank.
   But the king has not yet anounced a decision on the validity of
Jordanian passports held by most of the 850,000 West Bank
Palestinians.
   More than half of the 2.8 million Jordanians are of Palestinian
origin.
   The PLO official said the visiting delegation also was preparing
for a long-expected visit of the group's leader, Yasser Arafat.
   Asked if Arafat would visit Jordan this month, the official
replied: ``God willing, he might.'' Arafat was in Libya on Friday
for meetings with leader Moammar Gadhafi about his proposal to pay
the salaries of West Bank workers fired by Jordan, the official
Libyan news agency JANA said.
   A senior Jordanian official, who also requested anonymity, said
earlier this week that the PLO team would discuss the possibility
of Jordan's reconsidering its decision to sever ties with the
occupied territories.
   But Hussein told reporters last weekend that the option of
reversing the decision ``does not exist.''
   The PLO delegation has scheduled two more days of talks with
Jordanian officials.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge said Friday the new fraud and
conspiracy trial of Lyndon LaRouche and his associates could last
at least a year, but the defense said it would try to block
proceedings from starting in October.
   At a hearing in U.S. District Court, lawyers for the political
extremist said they would appeal Judge Robert E. Keeton's decision
ordering a new trial.
   Defense lawyers also said they would seek more information about
a February 1985 memo from FBI executive assistant director Oliver
Revell to then-FBI Director William Webster regarding an bomb
threat against former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger that
allegedly involved LaRouche affiliates.
   LaRouche, six aides and five political organizations are charged
with conspiring to obstruct a federal grand jury investigation into
allegations that LaRouche's 1984 presidential campaign raised more
than $2 million through credit card and loan fraud.
   Keeton, who ordered the new trial Thursday three months after
declaring a mistrial, said he plans to schedule daylong daily
sessions starting Oct. 3 and pre-screen jurors to guard against
complaints about the trial's length.
   ``In light of my estimate that this trial is going to last a
year or longer, it's important to get in as many hours per day as
possible,'' Keeton said.
   The first trial, which began last December, was suspended in
March for hearings into government documents referring to LaRouche.
Those included a memo from retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard
Secord to then-National Security Council aide Oliver North,
now-declassified FBI documents on information-gathering against
LaRouche, and other FBI, CIA and NSC records.
   The defense has maintained that the FBI and CIA infiltrated
LaRouche organizations to fabricate evidence of fraud.
   Keeton halted all proceedings in May after excusing four jurors
who complained about the length and conduct of the case. That left
only 10 jurors out of the original 12 and two alternates, and the
defense exercised its right not to continue with fewer than 12.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Markham said the FBI's 1985 memo
and a 1982 telex about a bomb threat against Kissinger were
irrelevant to the fraud and conspiracy charges.
   LaRouche attorney Daniel Alcorn said the document was pertinent
because it was written after the government began its fraud
investigation of LaRouche and could be used as evidence to prove
the government set up LaRouche.
   The defense Friday also withdrew motions to divide the case into
separate trials for the credit card fraud, loan fraud and
conspiracy charges. Attorneys said separate trials could have
prolonged the case even more because some witnesses would be called
three or four times.
   Markham said he expects the prosecution will produce 75 hours of
direct testimony. Adding cross-examination by defense attorneys,
Markham estimated the case would take 300 hours, or about 3{ months.
   Defense lawyers, who in the first trial raised some issues
several times, refused to estimate how long their case would take.
   Michael Riley, one of about a dozen LaRouche attorneys, said
defendants would ask the federal appeals court to delay the trial
until their appeal is heard.
   The defense last month charged prosecutors with intentionally
causing the mistrial because its case ``was going nowhere.''
Defendants had claimed a new trial would violate their Fifth
Amendment rights against being tried twice on the same charges.
   LaRouche, who is seeking the presidency a fourth time, is
charged with one count of conspiracy for allegedly ordering
supporters to destroy records and refuse to cooperate with
investigators. All six aides and the five organizations also are
charged with conspiracy, and four of the groups are charged with
fraud.

   Despite doctors' fears that a
47-year-old woman would not survive massive head and chest
injuries, she emerged from a two-month coma by speaking her
husband's name and nodding to her doctor.
   Yung Hsu was struck by a truck June 2 when she and her husband,
Bill, crossed a street.
   ``I prayed for a miracle and it is true now. It came true,''
said Hsu, 47, who immigrated from Taiwan 24 years ago.
   Mrs. Hsu surprised her doctor Saturday by raising two fingers
and nodding her head to show she understood him.
   Hsu looked into his wife's eyes and saw recognition.
   ``I said, `If you hear me, nod your head,''' he said.
   Mrs. Hsu, a patient at Memorial Medical Center, nodded again.
   But what moved her husband most was when his wife spoke his name
Sunday.
   ``I called her name and she called me back,'' Hsu said. ``That
is the moment I was really happy.''
   Doctors said she has a chance for a full recovery, said Hsu.
   The driver of the truck, Brett Damon Hayes, 24, is scheduled to
be arraigned on drunken driving charges Aug. 18 in Orange County
Municipal Court.

<TEXT>
   The Coast Guard's busiest drug interdiction team is
delighted to have a share of $60 million in emergency money and
ready to ``stir it up with the opposition,'' a Coast Guard official
said Friday.
   ``There's nothing worse than being on a ship that won't get
under way,'' said Capt. John Linnon, chief of staff of the Seventh
Coast Guard District, which stretches from South Carolina, Georgia,
Florida and the Caribbean to Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.
   ``The people in the Coast Guard are happy to get back to work.
We're ready to stir it up with the opposition,'' he said.
   Congress on Thursday shifted $60 million to the Coast Guard to
help restore a variety of operations cut last winter. The shift was
part of a $672 million emergency spending bill.
   ``I'm delighted with this action,'' the Seventh District
commander, Rear Adm. Martin H. Daniell, said in a statement. ``Now
we can get our planes back in the air and our cutters out to sea
where they can do their job.''
   ``The budget fight is not over,'' Linnon said, standing in front
of the polished white cutters at the Coast Guard's Base Miami
Beach. ``The $60 million is what we need to finish out the (fiscal)
year.''
   Linnon said the Seventh District, the busiest in drug
intervention efforts, had to cut to three of the biggest,
deep-water cutters per day and had seen seizures drop by half from
January to August. Now, the district will be able to put to sea six
or seven cutters.
   The district had already started to increase patrols in
anticipation of the budget shift.
   ``We've proven over the years that it (increased activity) makes
a difference,'' he said.
   The money will be spread among all 10 of Coast Guard districts
and will go toward a variety of needs, including resuming training,
replenishing spare parts, carrying out deferred maintenance and
resuming patrols. Linnon said he hasn't seen how the money will be
distributed, but more than 25 percent of District 7's budget is
spent on stopping drug traffic.
   ``I see this as an excellent signal that the Congress will
support the president's Coast Guard budget for the upcoming fiscal
year,'' said Adm. Paul A. Yost, commandant of the Coast Guard.
``Now that we have the $60 million we are ready to charge ahead.''
   In January, the Coast Guard said it was being forced to cut back
anti-drug efforts by 55 percent because of a shortage of money. The
impact of the cuts was most sharply felt in the Southeast because
90 percent of all Coast Guard seizures are made in the waters off
Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and the Caribbean Basin, officials
said.
   During the cutback, the Coast Guard averaged about 100 cutter
days per month in District 7, but that number could double with the
additional money.
   During the cutback, the Coast Guard had continued to respond to
reports of suspicious activity on the seas, but had cut back on
routine patrols.

   A prominent historian and an editor
published open letters Friday urging the reformist Soviet weekly
Moscow News to condemn what they characterized as repression in
Romania.
   ``When human rights are trampled underfoot, it cannot be seen as
just an `internal affair,' whether this happens in South Africa,
Chile or Romania,'' wrote historian Miklos Kun, the son of Bela
Kun, who led the abortive Soviet republic established in Hungary in
1919.
   ``By what title do we condemn racial persecution ... dictatorial
regimes ... around the world if, in a Romania that belongs to the
socialist camp, there is not even the semblance of democracy?'' Kun
asked.
   He took issue with a Moscow News article on the dispute between
Warsaw Pact allies Hungary and Romania over the alleged
discrimination against ethnic Hungarians living in Romania.
   The article, published in a July edition of the Soviet weekly,
was careful not to take sides in the dispute.
   But Kun said he considers it ``incorrect'' that the weekly
``does not raise its voice against Romanian arbitrariness.''
Romania is socialism's ``last bastion of the cult of personality,''
he said, painting a dismal picture of alleged repression there.
   Kun's letter was published in the Aug. 14 edition of New Mirror,
along with a similar letter from the weekly's editor, Sandor
Fekete, who said he hoped Moscow News would drop its neutral stance.
   He said an open, informative press should be able to express its
opinion even if the Soviet government stays out of the
Hungarian-Romanian dispute.
   Moscow News recently started publishing a Hungarian-language
edition.

   The next time Hollywood's
directors want to outfit actors for a cops 'n' robbers epic, they
should pay a visit to this tiny town, home of the nation's
best-dressed police.
   ``We stand for spit and polish,'' Chief Larry D. Parker, a
former military police officer, said Friday.
   The award has been handed out for 11 years by the National
Association of Uniform Manufacturers and Distributors, based in New
York.
   Stafford Township officers, working out of headquarters in the
Manahawkin section of the rural, southern New Jersey community,
bested more than 300 departments nationwide, said the executive
director of the association, Bernard J. Lepper.
   Oregon state police won the best-dressed state police award; the
Pinellas County sheriff's department in Florida won the top county
honors, and the Denver police department received the award for
best-dressed municipality with more than 200 officers.
   Stafford Township, with 37 officers and 10 uniformed, civilian
dispatchers, took the award for best-dressed municipality with
under 200 officers, and also walked away with the grand national
prize.
   The department's uniform consists of slate-gray trousers and a
midnight-blue shirt with matching epaulets and chrome buttons.
All-leather accessories _ including the belt and holster _ are made
of an intricate basket-weave design. A slate-gray Stetson hat
completes the outfit.
   ``We have daily inspections, and we've sent people home if they
don't pass,'' Parker said. ``If they need to change their trousers
or get a haircut, they go home and make up for it on their own
time.''
   Parker is an instructor at the Ocean County police academy, and
said he teaches his classes that ``90 percent of an officer's
effectiveness is determined by his uniform. If he looks sharp and
feels proud, all he really needs is some voice control and a sense
of personal control.''
   Even if a community cannot afford fancy uniforms, ``you can
still look sharp. A uniform can still be creased, be clean and
shoes can always be shined,'' he said.
   Lepper said the manufacturers assocation evaluates entrants on
image projection, ease of identification, reflection of the
department's authority and professionalism, practicality and
protection from weather and physical attacks.
   The police departments also are scrutinized on how carefully
they follow through on their dress code, he said.
   ``The single most important thing is that a police department
must have consistency,'' he said. ``We want every police officer to
look the same.''
   The judges included a master tailor, a New York City police
lieutenant and the publisher of Law and Order, a police magazine.
   The 56-year-old uniform association represents textile mills,
uniform manufacturers, dealer distributors and accessory
manufacturers, Lepper said.
   It also sponsors annual awards for the best-dressed high school
or college band, and the Image of the Year awards, which includes
uniforms from car rental agencies, airlines, real estate agencies
and other companies.
   ``A police officer's uniform is extremely important,'' Lepper
said. ``When someone has an auto accident or has been mugged or
assaulted, it's very comforting to see a police officer's uniform.''
   ``Of course, it's different if you're getting a parking
ticket,'' he joked.

<TEXT>
   The Nicaraguan government is withholding
approval of the names the State Department has submitted as
replacements for eight U.S. envoys who were expelled by Sandinista
authorities last month, a spokesman said Friday.
   Other officials said the administration does not intend to
replace Ambassador Richard Melton, who was among those expelled,
but instead plans to send Kenneth Skoug, head of the State
Department's office of Cuban affairs, to run the embassy.
   As embassy charge d'affairs, Skoug would not require Senate
confirmation. The officials, speaking only on condition they not be
named, said it was doubtful that any ambassadorial nominee could
receive Senate confirmation before congressional adjournment on
Oct. 8.
   They said Sandinista refusal to approve the envoys proposed as
replacements apparently was in retaliation for the U.S. expulsion
of Nicaraguan Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann, who served as chief
envoy to both the United States and the Organization of American
States.
   Nicaragua maintains that the administration acted beyond its
authority in expelling a diplomat accredited to the OAS.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said a U.S.-Nicaraguan
agreement calls for a reply to be given on visa applications for
diplomats assigned to either country's embassy within five days of
the visa request.
   The Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry informed the U.S. Embassy in
Managua that this provision of the agreement had been suspended and
that both the agreement and the U.S. visa requests were under
review, Redman said.
   ``Stalling on the issuance of visas indicates the Sandinista
regime wishes to prevent the U.S. Embassy from functioning
normally,'' Redman said.
   On July 11, Nicaragua ordered the seven American diplomats to
leave the country within 72 hours, charging that they had been
interfering in Nicaragua's internal affairs by encouraging
anti-government protests.
   The State Department denied that the diplomats had acted
improperly and ordered Tunnermann and seven of his colleagues home.
   It said Tunnermann had engaged in unspecified illegal activities
during his U.S. stsy and that a U.S. agreement with the OAS
permitted the United States to expel any OAS diplomat guilty of
such behavior.

<HEAD>Police Say Chicago Arrest Key To Uncovering Pedophile Network</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A convicted Chicago sex offender gave Tampa
police the break needed to crack a pedophile network offering
sex-for-hire with young boys, court records show.
   Authorities say the underground network operated for about eight
years, selling the services of boys, ages 11 to 16, for as much as
$1,000 a session.
   Police say tips generated from their case have prompted them to
contact the FBI and law enforcement agencies in Pinellas, Volusia
and Orange counties. They said they believe customers from Atlanta,
Boston, Chicago and Denver became involved in Tampa's clandestine
organization for pedophiles.
   ``This is going to be going on for months,'' predicted Tampa
Detective Bob Sheehan.
   So far, four people have been arrested in the case, which became
public Wednesday.
   Three were Floridians. The other, a Chicago businessman on
probation for a 1985 sexual abuse conviction, was arrested after
detectives received a tip from a Tampa woman who became suspicious
when she overheard one of her 11-year-old sons talking on the
telephone.
   Stanley Irving Lansing, 57, had met the boy and his twin brother
at least once before, according to charges filed by prosecutors.
Detectives had the boys arrange another rendezvous, and Lansing was
arrested April 9.
   From Lansing, the case widened to three other men, including
Michael David ``Wesley'' Gonzalez, 26, of Daytona Beach. Police say
he is believed to have arranged sexual encounters between men and
boys for years.
   Lansing, of Highland Park, Ill., was charged with four counts of
sexual battery on a child under 12. He pleaded guilty June 22 to
two lesser charges of attempted sexual battery and agreed to
testify in exchange for a 15-year prison term.
   Lansing had faced the possibility of four life sentences with no
chance of parole for 100 years with his original charges: four
counts of sexual battery on a child under 12.
   In Chicago, some adolescent boys in poor neighborhoods knew
Lansing as the man with a red Mercedes who flashed lots of money,
the St. Petersburg Times reported Friday. He was convicted of
buying sex from four young boys in Chicago in 1985, placed on
probation for three years and ordered to stay away from children,
the Times said.
   Gonzalez, an aircraft electronics technician, was arrested June
28 in Volusia County and charged with sexual battery, procuring a
minor for prostitution and deriving support from prostitution.
Prosecutors say he arranged to sell the sexual services of an
11-year-old boy at a hotel in March.
   Larry Richard Gorman, 38, a Tampa car salesman, was arrested
June 9 and charged with having sexual activity with a child.
   Michael Leroy Johnson, 30, of Tampa, a paint company branch
manager, was arrested June 28 and charged with two instances of
lewd and lascivious acts in the presence of a child under 16.
   Gonzalez is being held without bail. Lansing is being held
awaiting sentencing Sept. 7. Gorman and Johnson were each released
on $5,000 bail.

<HEAD>Former Premier's Memoirs to be Published</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former premier who was purged after
the 1956 uprising and expelled from the Communist Party says he and
other Stalinist leaders of the 1950s should have been called to
account for their deeds then.
   The political weekly Kepes 7 carried excerpts of Andras
Hegedues' memoirs in its Aug. 13 issue, available in Budapest on
Friday.
   The magazine said the memoirs are to be published by the
Communist Party publishing house Kossuth and that Hegedues has been
allowed to resume teaching, indicating he has been rehabilitated.
   Hegedues, 66, was a political outcast for years because of his
critical stand toward the regime and the party.
   He was premier under the Stalinist leader Matyas Rakosi in 1955,
and kept the post when Imre Nagy, pioneer of the 1956 revolt, took
over the party leadership from Rakosi in 1956.
   Hegedues was purged after the revolt was put down by Soviet
tanks in November 1956, but was able to find refuge in Moscow,
returning to Hungary in 1958.
   He said he considers it ``an historical injustice that most of
the leading persons of the (early) 1950s _ including myself _ got
off unscathed. We were never called to account.''
   But he also criticized Nagy, who was executed in 1958.
   ``Imre Nagy committed a mistake by taking a political step in
1956 which at that time looked impermissible in the East European
context,'' Hegedues was quoted as saying.
   Nagy had promised to establish a multiparty system and announced
Hungary's withdrawal from the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact alliance and
called on the West for support of a neutral Hungary.
   The revolt began Oct. 23, 1956, with mass demonstrations for a
new government and demands that Soviet troops leave Hungary. On
Nov. 4, 200,000 Soviet troops and 2,500 tanks entered Budapest to
quell the uprising.
   The uprising was sparked by popular revulsion for Rakosi's
repressive regime.
   Hegedues indicated it was clear at the time that Nagy was
destined to fail because he was trying to implement such radical
changes ``when the Soviets vested full powers over him.''
   Hegedues said the revolt was a ``memento'' for politicians and
the public, ``rather than a model that should be followed.''
   If Nagy instead had become premier and Janos Kadar had taken
over the party from Rakosi in 1956, ``we would certainly have
avoided the ... uprising,'' Hegedues said.
   Kadar called for Soviet assistance in 1956 and was party leader
from then until last May, when he was replaced by Premier Karoly
Grosz.
   Hegedues has called for reforms in Hungary, including greater
pluralism in society and more autonomy for social insititutions.

<HEAD>Order Extended Barring Sale of Videotape Jackson Never Approved</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson won an extension Friday of a
temporary court order barring a suburban company from selling or
distributing videotapes of his Democratic National Convention
speech.
   U.S. District Judge James B. Zagel extended a temporary ban and
indicated he would issue a preliminary injunction Tuesday barring
MPI Home Video from profiting from the former presidential
candidate's speech until the whole issue can be decided at trial.
   The case is set to go to trial Aug. 30 unless the two sides
reach agreement, said Henry Mason, a Jackson attorney.
   ``I'm pleased with the result,'' Mason said. ``He ruled in our
favor, on a preliminary basis.''
   But Eric Cohen, an attorney for Oak Forest-based MPI, said he
would appeal and declined further comment.
   Jackson, who was not in court Friday, contends the tape
exploited his name and literary and oratorical skills, and hurt his
livelihoood by diminishing his chances of selling his own tape of
the speech.
   In his ruling, Zagel agreed, saying there is ``more than
negligible probability that (Jackson) earns part of his living ...
on his oratory.'' He added that even the defendants acknowledged
their videotape ``will hurt anything Jackson tries to sell.''
   MPI President Waleed B. Ali and his attorneys argue that MPI
didn't need Jackson's authorization because his hour-long speech
July 19 in Atlanta was a news event, unprotected by federal
copyright law. MPI paid ABC for the rights to its coverage.
   But Zagel said the speech ``is an original literary work.'' The
judge added that the fact that Jackson had waited to copyright the
speech until after he learned of Ali's enterprise was insignificant.
   Ali said Thursday that he was motivated to make the tape by
money and the event's historic importance.
   ``I thought we had a hot-seller,'' Ali testified.
   As for the suggestion that he should have obtained Jackson's
permission before selling the tapes, he said, ``Why should our
medium be singled out as the only medium to get approval?''

   Toombs County Probate Judge Annie Laurie
Hussey is no ordinary politician.
   This week, Mrs. Hussey _ at 91 _ won her 12th consecutive
four-year term. She did not campaign nor did she spend a cent
except for a qualifying fee of $767.25.
   ``I just stayed in my office and worked,'' she said.
   ``I didn't see spending all that money on posters and cards.
I've lived here all my life and didn't see any use in having to
introduce myself to the public,'' she said.
   She received 3,110 votes to 2,695 votes for her opponent in the
Democratic primary, Jackie Driskell, a 41-year-old legal secretary.
There is no Republican candidate.
   ``It's as close a race as I ever run,'' Mrs. Hussey said in a
telephone interview Friday.
   ``The reason I ran again was that all the lawyers in town all
came to me and asked me to stay on,'' she said. ``That was a great
boost and I've tried to keep up with all the new laws to help
them.''
   Asked if she will run again in four years, Mrs. Hussey said:
``Time tells the tale. I don't know, but my health is better now
than when I was 50. I always have a checkup every six months. I
think that's the secret to my health.''

   New Jersey farmers are eligible to apply for
Farmers Home Administration emergency loans to help cover part of
their crop drought losses, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng
announced Friday.
   Lyng said farmers in all of the state's 21 counties have eight
months in which to apply for the loans to help cover part of their
actual losses. To be eligible, they must be able to repay the FmHA
loan and any other loans, must be unable to get credit elsewhere,
and must have adequate security, he said.
   New Jersey is the 10th entire state designated eligible for FmHA
emergency drought loans. Others are Alabama, Delaware, Indiana,
Iowa, Maryland, Missouri, Ohio, Wisconsin and West Virginia.

   Twenty-six more anti-abortion activists were
arrested outside a women's clinic Friday, including the four people
who drove the the protesters to the site.
   The total number of arrests in the series of demonstrations,
which began July 19 during the Democratic National Convention,
reached 381 with the latest incident.
   The arrests of the four drivers marked a new strategy for
Atlanta police. The vehicles were impounded, and police said the
drivers would be charged with being party to a crime, a misdemeanor.
   The 22 others were arrested as they locked arms, sang and prayed
outside the Atlanta SurgiCenter, scene of a protest Thursday. Sgt.
Melvin Denson said Friday's protesters would be charged with
criminal trespass and obstructing highways and sidewalks.
   Twenty-two people were arrested at the clinic Thursday,
including six who were charged with terroristic acts after they
entered the clinic.
   On Friday, the demonstrators were under strict orders from their
leaders not to enter the clinic. A spokesman said Operation Rescue,
the group that organized the demonstrations, does not condone
actions such as entering the clinics.
   Many of those arrested in the series of demonstrations have
remained in jail because they refused to give their names,
identifying themselves only as Baby John Doe or Baby Jane Doe.
   On Friday, authorities said 160 remained behind bars.
   Six protesters had preliminary hearings Friday in Municipal
Court, and all but one were transferred to State Court for further
proceedings. A felony count of obstruction against the sixth was
transferred to Superior Court.

<TEXT>
   A man who set out for his dental clinic
and took an unintended 1,120-mile detour last month finally reached
the dentist's chair, where he was rewarded with free dentures.
   ``I ain't embarrassed,'' said 76-year-old Frank Collier of
Centreville. ``It could've happened to anybody.''
   In fact, it almost happened to Collier's friend, 80-year-old
Deacon Brisco Huff, who agreed to drive Collier from Centreville to
the dental clinic 74 miles away in Pell City on Thursday.
   Huff took two wrong turns and had to stop six times to ask for
directions.
   ``I got lost, too, but I was determined not to go as far as he
went,'' said Huff.
   Collier, a retired mill worker who had never left west Alabama
except for one other trip to Pell City, ended up driving 560 miles
_ all the way to Muncie, Ind., before he found out how far off
course he had gone. Police in Muncie helped Collier get in touch
with family and friends, who drove him back.
   ``They told me they didn't think I'd better drive no more,''
Collier said Thursday. ``I told them that was fine with me because
I was tired of it.''
   ``I was trying to follow the road this fellow took when he
brought me up here the first time I came, a long time ago,''
Collier explained. ``I thought I could find my way back my own
self. I got on that interstate (I-65) and didn't know how to get
off. I just kept a-goin', kept a-goin', right out of the state,
almost out of the country.''
   Joining Collier and Huff on the trip Thursday was Huff's wife,
Iola, who was stationed in the front seat with a map of Alabama on
her lap.
   When Collier finally arrived at Dr. Joe Sawyer's clinic _ 30
minutes late _ the dentist gave his most famous patient a free set
of dentures, with two gold teeth in front.
   As Collier and the Huffs departed, Mrs. Huff said they probably
would be back in Centreville by late afternoon. But then, thinking
of other possibilities, she added, ``We just may end up in Florida.
You never know.''

   ``Sophie's Choice'' is Mayor Sophie Masloff's
theme for her anti-litter campaign, but people familiar with the
book and film of the same name say the slogan is in poor taste.
   William Styron's book told the story of a Polish woman sent to a
World War II concentration camp who was forced by the Nazis to
choose which of her two children would be killed.
   ``I love Sophie dearly. I wish she had chosen another slogan by
virtue of the fact it can raise an issue,'' said Richard Marcovitz,
rabbi at Congregation B'nai Israel.
   ``I think it was in bad taste,'' said Councilwoman Michelle
Madoff.
   ``The reason it doesn't bother me is I know Sophie Masloff
personally and I know the furthest thing from her mind would be
anything that in the least bit would have any negative
implications,'' said Stanley Ruskin, chairman of the Pittsburgh
chapter of the American Jewish Committee.
   ``It's just a catch phrase. That's why I chose it, not for any
significance at all,'' the mayor said Thursday.
   ``This Sophie's Choice might not win an Academy Award, but it's
my No. 1 priority,'' said Mrs. Masloff.
   The clean-up campaign includes buying new street sweeping
machines, setting out additional trash containers, paving 70 miles
of city streets this year and cleaning every vacant city lot by
October.

Revisions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JACK ELLIOTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mississippi legislators worked Friday to
pass anti-corruption legislation inspired by an FBI investigation
that led to guilty verdicts against dozens of county officials, but
the House and Senate were not in agreement.
   The federal investigation into corrupt county purchasing
practices has resulted in charges ranging from extortion to mail
fraud against 56 supervisors in 25 counties. Of those, 42 have
pleaded guilty, six have been convicted, one has been acquitted,
one died before going to trial, one died after sentencing, and
another was declared mentally incompetent to stand trial. The
remaining ones still have charges pending.
   The state Senate prepared Friday to consider its version of a
county government reorganization bill, approval of which would
require negotiations between that chamber and the House.
   The House passed a measure Friday dealing with purchasing laws.
   The lawmakers were in their third day of a special session
called by Gov. Ray Mabus, who took office in January pushing county
government reform as one of the four main goals of his first
legislative session. The House and Senate were unable to agree on a
bill during their 120-day regular session earlier this year.
   Mabus was state auditor for the four years before he was elected
governor, and he assisted the FBI in its ``Operation Pretense''
investigation of corrupt county purchasing.
   The county reorganization bill was endorsed Friday by the Senate
County Affairs Committee after it substituted language in a measure
passed Thursday by the House with that proposed by state Sen. Eddie
Briggs of DeKalb.
   State Sen. Bill Renick of Ashland said the House version was
``merely the bill that we saw during the regular session.'' He
said: ``It was heinous then, it's heinous now.''
   Mabus has claimed the ``beat system,'' still in use in 60 of
Mississippi's 82 counties, invites public officials to steal. Under
that system, supervisors maintain control over daily operations in
their individual districts.
   Mabus has pushed for a law that would require counties to adopt
the so-called county unit system, under which the five county
supervisors would set policy and hire an administrator to oversee
day-to-day operations.
   The purchasing law measure passed 118-0 Friday by the House
would allow governmental bodies to buy items costing less than $500
and not have to follow the purchase prices set by the state Office
of General Services through competitive bids.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee worked Friday to incorporate
purchasing law revisions in the Senate version of the county unit
bill.
   The Senate version of the bill differs in several ways from that
approved by the House, although both would mandate central
purchasing and inventory control systems for counties.
   Both would provide for referendums in each county, allowing
voters to decide if their counties would construct and maintain
roads on a centralized basis, although the versions would word the
question differently.
   The Senate provisions would allow counties to hire
administrators, but would not require them to do so. The chancery
clerk could agree to serve as county administrator, or as
purchasing or receiving clerk. The House language would mandate
hiring of an administrator.
   Both bills would require road managers for counties choosing
central road construction and maintenance. The Senate version would
prohibit the county engineer from serving as county road manager.
   Both versions would require separate clerks for purchasing,
receiving and inventory control, but lawmakers have said those
could come from existing personnel.
   The 1988 legislative session ended with three-member negotiating
teams from the House and Senate refusing to budge in areas where
the chambers differed, killing the county unit legislation. Mabus
then vetoed a bill that would have given 20 percent pay raises to
the state's 410 supervisors.

<HEAD>Attorney General Acknowledges Ban On Exit Polling Is
Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HELENA, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A controversial Montana law prohibiting the
questioning of voters outside polling places violates the U.S.
Constitution, the state attorney general acknowledged Friday.
   But Mike Greely, representing the state in a lawsuit filed
against it by NBC, asked U.S. District Judge Charles Lovell to
leave intact the remainder of the law, which bans any questioning
of voters in a polling place itself.
   In a brief filed in federal court, Greely acknowledged the
prohibition of exit polling is ``constitutionally invalid'' and
said it should be stricken from the statute.
   But, he added, ``It is constitutionally permissible for the
defendants to enforce the statute to the extent it prohibits
solicitation of an elector within a polling place or any building
in which an election is being held.''
   The proposal to eliminate the disputed language, submitted by
Assistant Attorney General Patricia Schaeffer, came in a case filed
by NBC just before Montana's June 7 primary election.
   Exit polling is used by television networks to project winners
in elections before votes are counted.
   The late Secretary of State Jim Waltermire had pushed for the
ban after the 1980 presidential election, in which networks
predicted Ronald Reagan would win before polls closed in Montana.
   On June 3, four days before the Montana primary, Judge Lovell
granted NBC's request for a preliminary injunction to prevent the
state from enforcing the ban.
   At that time, Lovell said the law is ``seemingly a broadside
attack upon significant, traditional and cherished First Amendment
freedoms.''

   Supporters of former Republican candidate Pat
Robertson were talking unity Friday after months of wrangling with
the Bush campaign over delegations to the GOP National Convention.
   Aides to the television evangelist said his name will not be
placed in nomination against Vice President George Bush, and they
promised no more than traditional convention floor demonstrations
when Robertson delivers his prime-time address Tuesday night.
   His speech will focus on many of the issues Robertson has
stressed during the campaign, including foreign policy and moral
values.
   ``And there will be a call for unity,'' said Barbara N.
Gattullo, director of communications for Americans for Robertson.
   She said, ``There are no plans to put his name in nomination. He
will release his delegates.''
   Robertson, who suspended his campaign on May 16, has 93
delegates according to The Associated Press survey. Vice President
George Bush has 1,998 delegates, many more than the 1,139 needed to
nominate.
   The former presidential candidate, who has returned to the
Christian Broadcasting Network, also will campaign for Bush in the
fall, Ms. Gattullo said.
   The talk of party unity comes after bitter fights in states such
as Michigan and Georgia over representation for Robertson
supporters in the state parties and the delegations attending the
convention.
   The Michigan battle was resolved prior to the Republican
gathering this week. The Bush and Robertson campaigns settled their
dispute in Georgia on Wednesday with Robertson supporters gaining
28 of the state's 48 delegate seats.
   The solution to Georgia's fierce fight was still being hailed by
the Robertson people on Friday.
   ``Georgia was a matter of definition,'' said Ms. Gattullo.
   ``There's a feeling of harmony because of the fair treatment of
the Georgia delegation,'' said Marc Nuttle, former campaign manager
for Robertson.
   Later, Nuttle called the Georgia resolution ``the bellwether in
making the Republican Party the party of the 1990s.''
   Nuttle's comments came as he released results of a survey of 250
Robertson supporters conducted immediately after the Democratic
National Convention. It found 69 percent definitely or at least
probably supporting Bush to 17 percent for Dukakis with the rest
undecided.
   Sixty-six percent said they would vote for Bush even if they
learned that he had had full knowledge of the Iran-Contra affair.
   Bush's selection of a vice president, a major concern among
conservative groups, may affect support for the Republican nominee,
according to Nuttle, but only if the choice is a liberal.
   ``There is a wide range of tolerance for vice president,''
Nuttle said. ``There's no evidence to indicate it's a volatile
issue.''

   An attorney for Miami Beach financier Victor
Posner says he has agreed to return 13 Norman Rockwell paintings he
took from Sharon Steel Corp. after he bought the company in 1969.
   The announcement in U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Warren Bentz's
courtroom Thursday by attorney Robert Cindrich was the company
chairman's first response to a lawsuit filed over the paintings.
   James W. Toren, a trustee appointed by the court to run Sharon
Steel during its Chapter 11 reorganization, sued for the return of
the art in June.
   The paintings have hung in Posner's Florida office for nearly 20
years.
   Cindrich said Posner does not have a 14th painting mentioned in
Toren's lawsuit. Russell Ober Jr., an attorney for the trustee,
said he will file a claim holding Posner responsible for that
painting.
   None of the attorneys could estimate the value of the paintings,
for which Sharon Steel paid Rockwell $50,000 in 1966.
   A single Rockwell illustration for a light bulb manufacturer
recently sold at auction for $200,000, said Linda Russell, an
assistant curator at the Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Mass.
   ``The Japanese are terribly interested in Rockwell,'' she said.
   Rockwell, best known for his folksy Saturday Evening Post cover
illustrations, died in 1978.

<TEXT>
   Fred Paul Faltersack, a sleight of hand
expert who helped Houdini develop some of his illusions, has died
at age 94.
   Faltersack died of congestive heart failure Sunday at O'Connor
Hospital in San Jose.
   Although Faltersack spent much of his life as an industrial arts
and mechanical engineering teacher, including positions at
California Polytechnic and Santa Clara University, magic was always
his passion.
   He met Harry Houdini while working his way through San Jose
State University and the famous musician appeared at a theater.
   In a 1982 interview, Faltersack recalled that he ``was the first
one up there'' on stage when Houdini asked for volunteers from the
audience to help him with his tricks.
   Faltersack then took Houdini to see the Winchester Mystery
House, a tourist attraction with optical illusions and other
amusements, where Faltersack worked as a tour guide. And in later
years, he helped Houdini build some of his illusions.
   In the early 1930s, Faltersack was appointed as a special
representative of the International Brotherhood of Magicians,
entitling him to make contact with top European magicians. He later
became a founding member of Mystic 13, a prestigious group of
American magicians.
   He is survived by his wife, Minnie; two sons; a daughter; a
brother; and a sister.

<HEAD>FAA Eyes Mid-1990s Launch for Vertical-Takeoff Aircraft</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration plans to
accelerate the certification of fixed-wing aircraft capable of
taking off and landing vertically so they might be available for
civilian use by the mid-1990s, officials said Friday.
   The so-called tilt-rotor aircraft technology, which is under
development by the military, is seen by some aviation industry
experts as a key to providing short-haul air transportation in the
future.
   FAA Adminstrator Allan McAtor, one of the government's chief
boosters of the technology, told reporters Friday that the
potential civilian uses for the tilt-rotor aircraft is virtually
limitless.
   He suggested it would be ideal for short-haul flights in areas
ranging from the congested skies of the Northeast and Southern
California to the isolated airfields of Alaska.
   Other aviation experts, however, suggest that the use of such
planes, which are expected to cost at least $20 million apiece and
carry only 24 to 30 people per flight, would be too high to be
economically successful in the near future.
   The tilt-rotor aircraft is envisioned as being capable of
landing and taking off like a helicopter and having a range of more
than 300 miles when its rotors are tilted for fixed-wing flight.
   McArtor said the FAA has entered into a memorandum of
understanding with the Defense Department to share development
information on the tilt-rotor aircraft program so that once the
military version is developed it may be adapted quickly for
civilian use.
   FAA officials estimated the agreement will shorten the time it
takes to certify such a plane for civilian use by as much as eight
years. McArtor estimated that the military version will be ready
for certification by 1992 and the civilian version three years
later.
   Six prototypes of the tilt-rotor craft already have been built
for the Defense Department by an industry team that includes Bell
Helicopter Textron, Boeing Helicopter and Allison Engine Division
of General Motors, officials said.
   The FAA also announced that it has awarded the Port Authority of
New York-New Jersey a $585,000 grant to conduct a study that would
determine where best to locate special landing and takeoff sites
for such aircraft. Additional grants are expected to be provided
shortly in other parts of the country, McArtor said.
   Stephen Berger, executive director of the Port Authority,
estimated that as many as 8 million business travelers might use
such an aircraft annually if routes are established that would take
them from the downtowns of one city to another.
   FAA officials acknowledged more studies will be needed to
determine the actual market potential, the cost per seat mile of
such aircraft and how such aircraft would be integrated into the
next century's air transportation system.
   Eventually, FAA planners envision tilt-rotor aircraft being used
extensively by commuter airlines to transport business travelers in
areas where capacity at conventional airports is increasingly
limited.
   In the Northeast, says Joseph Del Balzo, the FAA's regional
administrator in New York, a tilt-rotor aircraft eventually could
take business travelers from downtown Manhattan to downtown
Washington in 45 minutes.

   A federal judge removed from a Ku Klux
Klan case by an appeals court said Friday he wants to hear from the
nation's top civil rights enforcer before deciding to remove
himself from all government cases.
   U.S. District Judge William M. Acker Jr., during a hearing on
his own fitness for trial in government cases, said he did not know
how he will rule eventually.
   But, he said, ``I have made my mind up that I am not going to
rule on my motion to recuse until I hear from William Bradford
Reynolds,'' director of the civil rights division of the Justice
Department.
   The U.S. attorney in Birmingham said earlier the Justice
Department would not take part in Friday's hearing and would not
seek Acker's blanket removal from federal government cases.
   The Justice Department is involved in two long-running civil
rights cases in Alabama _ one involving the Ku Klux Klan and the
other involving allegations of segregation at the state's colleges.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals removed Acker from the
Klan case, saying his position against the government had become
hardened. Acker, 60, was appointed to the bench in 1982 by
President Reagan.
   By luck of the draw, however, Acker this week was assigned the
school case after the appeals court removed U.S. District Judge
U.W. Clemon, the first black federal judge in Alabama. Te appeals
court said Clemon could not be impartial because he had championed
desegregation efforts as a state senator and civil rights attorney.
   Since the Justice Department urged the appeals court to remove
him from the Klan case, Acker said he wants to know whether
Reynolds will object if he hears the school case. The Justice
Department had joined in the suit, which alleges race bias exists
in higher education programs and funding.
   ``I presume the 11th Circuit Court is reasonable,'' Acker said
Friday. ``They say I'm partial. If a reasonable person thinks I'm
partial, should I sit on federal cases?''
   Clemon, appointed to the bench by President Carter in 1980, was
among the spectators during Acker's hearing on his own motion for
recusal but did not comment. Three attorneys, who are not involved
in either case, did offer testimony that they had found Acker to be
fair and impartial when they had matters before him.
   Clemon said earliers this week that he was the victim of a
double standard demeaning to black federal jurists.
   Acker said he had invited responses from a wide variety of legal
and judicial organizations and individuals but had received only
one, from U.S. Attorney Frank Donaldson of Birmingham in which
Donaldson said the United States ``has at this time insufficient
information to determine and no reason to believe that Judge
Acker's proposed general recusal is either necessary or
appropriate.''

   The summer's unrelenting heat finally wore
down Gov. Tommy G. Thompson's resistance to air-conditioning the
Capitol.
   Thompson, who had vetoed a budget item for installation of air
conditioning, said Friday he was ``acquiescing.''
   The governor's surprise backing followed a facetious suggestion
from Rep. Marlin Schneider that impeachment proceedings might begin
if Thompson refused to budge.
   Statehouse employees were elated.
   ``I think it's wonderful,'' said Dianne McCaughy, a secretary
for Assembly Minority Leader Betty Jo Nelsen.
   Outside the governor's conference room, where Thompson made his
announcement, the mercury climbed to the 90-degree mark for the
30th day this summer. That was only 11 days short of a record set
in the mid-1930s, the Weather Service said.
   Several times this summer, when the temperature soared, the
Assembly has allowed workers in rooms that lacked window air
conditioners to take the afternooon off.
   Thompson, whose personal office has a room air conditioner as do
a number of legislators' offices, told reporters he encountered a
woman in the Capitol Thursday who told him she would ``be glad to
pay higher taxes'' for air conditioning in the building.
   ``I've acquiesced,'' Thompson said.
   Schneider said fears among the public that air conditioning the
70-year-old Capitol would lead to even lengthier legislative
sessions ``is absolutely ridiculous.''
   The reality, he said, is that workers' productivity drops in the
summertime because the building is so hot and uncomfortable.
   Schneider estimated that the project could cost as much as $6
million. About 1,000 people work in the building, he said.

   Actress Anne Ramsey, whose grotesque
character in ``Throw Momma From the Train'' won her an Oscar
nomination and a following in the twilight of her career, died of
throat cancer. She was 59.
   Her husband of 34 years, actor Logan Ramsey, was at her side
when she died Thursday evening at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,
where she had been for about a week, hospital spokeswoman Peggy
Shaff said Friday.
   The actress often appeared with her husband in projects,
including Clint Eastwood's ``Any Which Way You Can,'' scheduled to
air Friday night on CBS-TV.
   She appeared in two Barbra Streisand films, ``Up the Sandbox''
and ``For Pete's Sake'' and played Nick Nolte's addled mother in
``Weeds.'' In ``Goonies,'' she uttered the line, ``Put that kid's
hand in the blender and hit puree.''
   Mrs. Ramsey's television credits included roles in ``The Young
and the Restless,'' guest appearances on ``Hill Street Blues,''
``Night Court'' and ``Knight Rider,'' and movies-of-the-week roles
in ``White Mama,'' ``The Boy in the Plastic Bubble,'' ``Blind
Ambition'' and ``Marilyn.''
   However, it was her role opposite actor-director Danny DeVito
and Billy Crystal in the dark comedy about matricide, ``Throw Momma
From the Train,'' that put her on the fast track.
   After 37 years in show business, she became famous as the
actress with the face of a mother no one could love.
   ``Some people say I'm not a very pretty woman, but I'm a very
beautiful woman inside,'' she said when asked about her appearance.
   As the murder-provoking harridan of ``Throw Momma,'' the
diminutive hunch-shouldered actress played her most tormented and
tormenting role. DeVito, as brow-beaten son Owen Lift, tries to
arrange a swap of murder victims: He will kill his writing
teacher's ex-wife if the teacher (Crystal) kills his mother.
   ``She became such a cult hero to young people after `Throw
Momma' that the kids wouldn't leave her alone. But she loved kids.
She enjoyed it all,'' said her publicist, Stan Rosenfield.
   ``I loved that woman. I loved everything about her,'' DeVito
said. ``I was so delighted over the success she achieved over the
past year. She was a woman of courage and should be admired by
all.''
   Mrs. Ramsey was nominated for an Academy Award for ``Throw
Momma,'' but lost to Olympia Dukakis of ``Moonstruck.'' She will be
seen in four still-to-be-released films: ``Dr. Hackenstein,''
``Scrooge,'' ``Good Ole Boy'' and ``Homer and Eddie.''
   It was the removal of part of her tongue during throat cancer
surgery three years ago that gave her the speech impediment evident
in ``Throw Momma From the Train.'' She began chemotherapy
treatments when the cancer recurred in April.
   During filming of ``Throw Momma,'' Mrs. Ramsey was undergoing
oral surgery and was enduring intense pain, said DeVito. He said
the actress never asked to be excused from work.
   In addition to her husband, Mrs. Ramsey is survived by a brother
and sister, Rosenfield said.
   A private burial was planned in Omaha, Neb., but the family kept
the date and location secret, Rosenfield said. A public memorial
service will be held Aug. 20 at St. Michael & All Angels' Episcopal
Church in Studio City, he said.

<HEAD>Mecham Assails Impeachment Conviction in Book</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Evan Mecham predicts he'll be
voted back into office by an electorate disgusted with the way he
was hounded from office by the state's political establishment.
   In a book titled ``Impeachment: The Arizona Conspiracy,'' Mecham
claims the real reason he was impeached and convicted of wrongdoing
in office was ``pure and simple raw political power exercised by
those groups who wanted to remain in control.''
   Mecham had the book printed privately and began selling it
Thursday for $2.95.
   ``It was clear that they (senators who voted to convict) did not
make that decision based on evidence,'' the former governor wrote.
   The Senate convicted Mecham on April 4 of misusing $80,000 from
the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership,
and of trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat.
   Mecham predicted public dissatisfaction with the impeachment
would lead to changes in the Legislature's makeup this fall,
adding, ``That should pave the way to win back the governorship
again.'' The next gubernatorial election is in November 1990, with
the winner to take office in January 1991.
   In May, Mecham was acquitted of criminal charges accusing him of
concealing a $350,000 campaign loan.
   ``In the final analysis, my error was not in what I did with the
(protocol) funds, but in thinking I was dealing with people who had
honor, integrity and the best interest of the state at heart,''
Mecham said in the book.
   On Thursday, Attorney General Bob Corbin filed a civil suit
asking that Mecham be forced to turn over the $80,000 remaining in
the protocol fund to the state. Mecham has insisted the fund is
private money and is seeking to return it to the donors himself.
   In his book, Mecham repeated his contention that some
establishment lawmakers, Corbin, the media and business leaders
banded together in a conspiracy to drive him from office.
   But he said they had only partly succeeded, adding, ``They have
not been able to fool all of the people in Arizona into believing
that Mecham was terrible for Arizona, a racial bigot or a mindless
buffoon ill-suited to be governor.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights on Friday
concurred in President Reagan's selection of William Barclay Allen,
a California professor, as the agency's chairman.
   He succeeds Clarence M. Pendleton Jr., who died June 5. The
commission's vote was 5-1.
   Allen, a professor of government at Harvey Mudd College in
Claremont, Calif., has served on the commission since April 1987.
He was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in
1986.
   The 44-year-old Allen, designated by Reagan last Monday, said
then that he will not allow the commission ``to become an arm of
the advocacy groups in the civil rights movement.''
   Pendleton held a similar view, and his disagreements with civil
rights groups led to numerous charges and countercharges. Under
Pendleton, for instance, the commission majority took strong
positions against goals, timetables and quotas to remedy past
discrimination; and against giving women comparable pay to men in
jobs requiring similar skills.
   Allen called Pendleton ``the first bona fide civil rights
leader'' to serve as chairman.''
   ``I am not a civil rights leader, nor a black leader,'' Allen
said. ``I am rather an accomplished professional whose professional
and civic life demonstrate a commitment to the ideal of equal
rights for all.''
   Voting in favor of Allen were commissioners Francis S. Guess,
Robert Destro, Murray Friedman, Esther G.A. Buckley and Allen.
Commissioner Mary Frances Berry was opposed.

<HEAD>Plans for Reactor to Float Down Ohio Under Way</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A deactivated reactor from the nation's
first nuclear power plant will be floated down the Ohio River in
October on its way to a nuclear waste depository in Washington
state, officials said.
   The reactor, to be removed from the deactivated Shippingport
Atomic Power Station about 35 miles northwest of Pittsburgh, is
expected to be unloaded in February at the Hanford nuclear
reservation in south-central Washington.
   The barge will go down the Ohio to the Mississippi River, into
the Gulf of Mexico, through the Panama Canal and up the Pacific
Coast.
   Although the reactor has been emptied of its nuclear fuel,
filled with concrete and enclosed in a neutron-shield tank, it's
classified as nuclear waste since it has been contaminated by
radiation.
   ``There has never been a plant this large decommissioned in this
country,'' said David Ney, a nuclear engineer for the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Resources. ``It's probably the largest
single shipment of nuclear waste in the nation's history.''
   Mike Molloy, executive director of Disaster and Emergency
Services in Kentucky, said Thursday that his agency hasn't received
word of the shipment to Hanford.
   Mike McKernan, a technology transfer program manager for
Westinghouse-Hanford Co., said the company would inform states
along the route when the loading date approaches.
Westinghouse-Hanford is the federal Department of Energy's
technical support contractor for Shippingport.
   The concrete-filled reactor and its enclosing shield, McKernan
said, together about 1,000 tons and measures about 45 feet high and
18 feet across.
   ``You can stand on it all day long and you wouldn't come in
contact with more radiation than if you were standing out in the
sun,'' McKernan said.
   The plant, commissioned in 1957, was the nation's first
commercial nuclear power plant. The federal Department of Energy
and Duquesne Light, the Pittsburgh-based power company, operated
the plant as a demonstration project. They began taking the plant
out of service four years ago.
   By June, the nuclear core was removed and the middle of the
reactor, which served as a heat source for water that was converted
to steam, was filled with concrete.
   The Department of Energy is charged with disposing of the
reactor and converting the property, owned by Duquesne Light, to
``a perfectly usable condition,'' McKernan said. Pennsylvania
officials are monitoring the process.

   A Molotov cocktail was hurled through the
living room window of a couple who spoke out against gangs, and
authorities pledged they would wield ``a bigger knife'' to excise
gang violence from their city.
   The home of Jenny and Roscoe Bryant was heavily damaged Thursday
night, officials said.
   ``When decent, good people can't go to sleep at night without
having to worry that someone is going to throw something into their
house, that means there's a cancer that we've got to cut out,''
said Councilman Warren Dorris. ``We'll get a bigger knife if we
have to.''
   The bombing took place despite increased patrols. The Bryants
were among neighborhood residents who asked for the added
protection and met with officials of this northern Illinois city to
discuss gang violence.
   A bottle of flammable liquid was thrown through the window 10:30
p.m. Thursday, Battalion Fire Chief Frank Ragusa said.
   It was not the first time the Bryants experienced violence this
summer.
   A suspicious fire destroyed another home they owned; the family
dog was shot dead; their car and house were peppered with bullets.
   ``They (gang members) holler at me all the time saying I'm the
lady who wants to put them in jail,'' Mrs. Bryant said.

   A controversial plan to provide free sterile
needles to drug addicts will begin in November as authorities try
to stem the spread of AIDS among drug abusers, the city health
commissioner said Friday.
   ``There were problems with law enforcement agencies, but we've
worked those bugs out,'' said Dr. Stephen C. Joseph, who expects
the program to start in about 10 weeks. ``They now agree with us
that this is not an illegal program.''
   The state Health Department approved the experiment this week,
Joseph said. The progam will involve 200 addicts and last six to
nine months.
   ``That's enough time for us to get a fair amount of data to
enable us to draw some conclusions,'' Joseph said. ``If something
goes wrong, if we are mistaken, we can stop things at any time.''
   Needles are already distributed in several other countries, but
no government agency in the United States has such a program. A
social service agency in Portland, Ore., however, announced plans
in June to begin a needle distribution program, but the program has
been held up.
   The use of dirty needles has become the leading method of
infection among new cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome in
New York City.
   If the New York experiment is a success, city officials hope to
broaden distribution among the city's estimated 200,000 intravenous
drug abusers. Sample blood tests indicate about half of that group
are already infected with the AIDS virus.
   Some prosecutors and leaders of the black community are among
those who oppose the needle plan, saying it will promote illicit
drug abuse.
   ``The end is commendable, of course,'' said Manhattan Borough
President David Dinkins. ``But I maintain that drug use is
unacceptable, and I do not accept the notion that we can make drugs
safer.''

   George Bush reviewed the names of potential
running mates with senior advisers Friday, asking ``a few questions
about a few people,'' but said he has not made up his mind, a
campaign source said.
   ``He indicated he has not narrowed it,'' the source said. ``We
talked about individuals. He's still asking questions and seeking
information.''
   The source, insisting on anonymity, said Bush told his advisers
he thought he would make his decision before he flies to New
Orleans on Tuesday for the Republican convention but wasn't sure of
that.
   Meanwhile, Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson, one of more than a
dozen people said to be under consideration, called Bush on Friday
to ask that his name be withdrawn, citing his family.
   ``The vice president's job requires a lot of national and
international travel,'' Thompson said. ``My wife couldn't travel
with me because I've got a 10-year-old in school, and that's not
true of the other candidates.''
   Bush is spending the weekend in Washington mulling his choice
and working on the speech he will deliver Thursday night in
accepting the Republican presidential nomination. On his arrival
here Tuesday, Bush will join President Reagan at an airport
ceremony and then get on a boat to cross the Mississippi River for
a welcoming rally downtown.
   Leaders of Bush's campaign assembled at his headquarters in
Washington at 7 a.m. Friday to talk with the vice president about
his search for a running mate.
   The group included Craig Fuller, his chief of staff; campaign
manager Lee Atwater; pollster Robert Teeter; media adviser Roger
Ailes; press secretary Sheila Tate; former Sen. Nicholas Brady,
nominated last week to be Treasury secretary, longtime Texas friend
Robert Mosbacher.
   Bush gave no clue about his preference, the source said. ``He
asked a few questions about a few people. He's seeking more
information. He hasn't made a decision and he's unwilling to say
when he will.'' The source refused to say who was discussed or how
many names were reviewed.
   Afterward, Atwater flew to New Orleans for final preparations
for the convention.
   Among Bush's staff, there were differing opinions on whether he
actually has made up his mind but just isn't telling anyone. One
official, insisting on anonymity, expressed the view that Bush
knows who he wants but is holding it back until the last minute.
   Gov. John Sununu of New Hampshire, one of the prospects, said he
thought Bush should keep it a secret until Wednesday or Thursday.
   GOP Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf said he is trying to persuade the
Bush forces it would be best to announce the running mate choice on
Wednesday night after the convention nominates Bush, as Reagan did
in 1980 when he chose Bush.
   Fahrenkopf, in an interview, said that making the announcement
on Thursday would undercut the news value of Bush's speech to the
convention Thursday night. It would put the only two big news
stories of the convention in competition with each other for
Friday's front pages.
   Fahrenkopf said he would favor having Bush come to the
convention hall, thank the delegates for nominating him and then
ask their support for his vice presidential choice.
   Meanwhile, Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., a co-chair of Bush's
campaign who has been mentioned as a possible running mate,
declined to say if she had been asked if she wanted to be
considered.
   However, she said, ``It's not going to be offered and I wouldn't
take it.''
   People who were contacted by Bush, and asked to provide
financial data, include Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole and his
wife, former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole, Rep. Jack
Kemp of New York, and Sens. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, Dan Quayle
of Indiana and Alan Simpson of Wyoming, according to campaign aides.
   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, rumored to be under
consideration, has said she isn't interested in the job.
   Govs. George Deukmejian of California, Thompson of Illinois,
Sununu of New Hampshire and Carroll Campbell of South Carolina and
former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee were also among those on
the original list of those under consideration, the aides said.
Deukmejian also has asked that his name be withdrawn.

<HEAD>Health Experts Plan Campaign For Preventive Care</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international medical conference
on Friday declared a campaign against disease that involves
training doctors in preventive care rather than waiting for their
patients to become ill.
   ``Man needs more than science alone,'' said a statement issued
by the World Conference on Medical Education after a five-day
meeting in the Old College of Edinburgh University.
   The conference was attended by 160 doctors and health
specialists and released the Edinburgh Declaration that was adopted
unanimously.
   It said in part that medical educators must produce doctors
``who will promote the health of all people _ not merely deliver
curative services to those who can afford it or to those for whom
it is readily available.''
   ``Thousands suffer and die every day from diseases which are
preventable, curable or self-inflicted and millions have no ready
access to health care of any kind,'' the declaration said.
   ``Such facts have produced a mounting concern in medical
education about equity in health care, the humane delivery of
health services and the cost to society.''
   The declaration was supported by representatives of three United
Nations agencies: the World Health Organization, the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the U.N. Development Program.
   National ministries of health and education, universities and
such funding institutions as the Rockefeller, Gulbenkian and
Kellogg foundations, and the World Bank helped finance the
conference.
   ``The message from this meeting is quite clear: Urgent reform of
medical training is needed in all countries so that doctors involve
their patients in keeping themselves well,'' said Henry Walton, an
Edinburgh University psychiatrist and president of the World
Federation for Medical Education.
   He said the steps to reform doctors' training will be monitored
by offices in six regions _ Africa, the Americas, Europe, the
Middle East, Western Pacific and Southeast Asia.
   With backing from the government-funded Scottish Development
Agency, a site for the central office has been offered by the city
of Edinburgh.
   Walton said the central office will have a staff of about eight
and an annual budget of $289,000. Followup conferences are
scheduled in Washington next month and Lisbon, Portugal, at the end
of October, he said.
   ``We want doctors everywhere to concentrate on how to encourage
people to take care of themselves,'' said Dr. George Miller from
Clinton, N.Y., former head of the center for educational
development at the University of Illinois.
   ``We want medical graduates to meet the needs of the people and
not be content with curing diseases,'' he said.
   Dr. James Grant, executive director of UNICEF, said more than
two thirds of the 14 million deaths of children each year were
caused by such diseases as diarrhea, measles, tetanus, whooping
cough and respiratory infection, and the victims could have been
protected at low cost.
   Grant said 50,000 people die prematurely every day from causes
that could be readily prevented.
   ``We have the technology to dramatically improve the health of
people over the next 20 years ... but will medical education play
its role?'' Grant asked.
   Eleanor McLaughlin, the mayor of Edinburgh, told the closing
session: ``We do need high-technology medicine, but ordinary people
everywhere know what they want: To keep healthy, to feed their
families and to have a city system that gives them clean water. I
know it will be a battle to get those things, it always has been.''

<HEAD>Pakistan to Lease Retiring US Warships</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pakistan, long troubled by the naval buildup
of arch-foe India, has struck a deal to lease up to eight of the 16
U.S. Navy frigates that are being retired for budgetary reasons,
officials said Friday.
   The deal, outlined to Congress on Thursday, makes all the more
final the Pentagon's grudging decision early this spring to suspend
the Reagan administration's drive for a 600-ship Navy.
   Although the ships are being leased and not sold to Pakistan _
and can be recalled if needed by the Navy _ ``it would probably
take a war for us to ask for them back,'' said one official who
asked not to be identified.
   Lt. Barbara Kent, a Navy spokeswoman, said Congress was informed
of the deal in a letter from Rear Adm. Thomas C. Lynch, the Navy's
chief of legislative affairs. Congress has 30 days to block the
transaction if it wishes to do so, she said.
   The spokeswoman said Pakistan would be allowed to inspect nine
frigates. According to another official who asked not to be named,
however, Pakistani officials have been told they can lease a
maximum of eight ships.
   A top congressional aide, who also requested anonymity, said
Congress was unlikely to intervene ``because the decision has
already been made to cut back the U.S. fleet.''
   ``The decision was made up here not to keep these ships in
service because of the cost of operating them, so if Pakistan wants
to take on that expense, we have no objection,'' the aide said.
   The ships, because of their age and boiler plants, require a
disproportionate number of sailors to operate compared with modern
warships.
   According to Lt. Kent, Pakistan has yet to say exactly how many
frigates it wants. The Navy, assuming Congress goes along, will
begin allowing Pakistani inspections of nine frigates in October,
she said.
   The Navy declined Friday to say how much Pakistan would pay for
the warships.
   But according to figures compiled by the Defense Security
Assistance Agency, the highest rental fee that Pakistan would be
charged for eight frigates would be $6.31 million per year.
   Pakistan is being offered an initial five-year lease on the
ships, but any agreement ``can be terminated at any time,'' the
Navy spokeswoman said.
   She identified the nine ships to be offered to the Pakistanis as
the Brooke, Ramsey, Schofield, Talbot, Page, Bradley, Edward
McDonnell, O'Callahan and Sample.
   The Brooke, Ramsey, Schofield, Bradley and O'Callahan are based
in San Diego, Calif. The Talbot and Edward McDonnell are based in
Mayport, Fla., while the Page is based in Norfolk, Va., and the
Sample in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.
   The deal with Pakistan is being struck five months after India
leased a nuclear-powered attack submarine from the Soviet Union for
its navy.
   ``The Indian navy is getting to be a powerful force,'' said one
Pentagon source. ``Pakistan is naturally concerned and they're
prepared to put forward the manpower needed to operate these
ships.''
   The American frigates being offered to Pakistan are of the
so-called Garcia and Brooke classes. They were built in the
mid-1960s.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci announced early this year in
unveiling the Pentagon's fiscal 1989 budget plan he had ordered the
Navy to retire the 16 frigates. He said the move was just one of
several designed to shrink U.S. military forces rather than
maintain a ``hollow'' force that wasn't ready to fight.
   That decision was stridently criticized by Navy Secretary James
H. Webb, who resigned in protest in February.
   Two months ago, the Navy announced it would decommission the
first 10 of the frigates by the end of this year and the remaining
six in 1989.
   The 16 ships are operated by more than 5,100 sailors.

   The European Economic Community

trying to determine what is killing thousands of harbor seals in
the North Sea.
   It also allocated $654,000 to a four-year research project on
algae growth in the North Sea. Some seals have died in waters where
algae have increased, but no clear link has been established.
   The Dutch institute is trying to identify the viruses that have
killed up to half the harbor seal populations in Scandinanvian,
West German and Dutch waters. About 7,000 harbor seals have died
since April.
   The Dutch National Institute of Public Health and Environmental

against the viruses and looking into dangers they may pose for
other species, including humans.

   A man who criticized the local judicial
system in May for being lenient on lawbreakers was charged with
armed robbery on Friday.
   Rex M. Truelove, 20, was charged with aggravated robbery in
connection with the hold-up of Cook's Drive Thru beverage store
Thursday night.
   Police said Truelove entered the cashier's office at the
business, pointed a .22-caliber revolver at employee Kenny Haddix
and demanded money. Haddix gave the man between $400 and $500,
police said.
   In a letter to the editor in the May 10 edition of the Urbana
Daily Citizen, Truelove complained that an incident at a fast-food
restaurant resulted in only mild punishment. A man entered the
restaurant with a 9mm rifle May 1 while Truelove was present.
   ``Now they have one who attempted to rob a store and they are
releasing him with only fines to pay. I think the damn judicial
system is very intolerable to many citizens of Urbana,'' the letter
said.
   Police said the incident was not an attempted robbery but an
argument between Truelove, who worked at the restaurant, and
another man. The other man brandished a weapon and was charged with
aggravated menacing.

   Chile's military rulers gave no sign
Friday of accepting a Roman Catholic church proposal that they
negotiate with the opposition about the nominee for the October
presidential referendum.
   Gen. Fernando Matthei, chief of the air force, told a news
conference the idea was ``interesting'' but indicated he does not
plan such negotiations before the commanders meet Aug. 30 to select
the nominee. President Augusto Pinochet, the army commander, is
expected to be their choice.
   ``I'll take it into account when we meet in 18 days,'' Matthei
said.
   Adm. Jose Merino, the navy commander, said after the proposal
was made Thursday that ``it's too late'' for an accord with the
opposition.
   Pinochet, the army commander, indirectly rejected the bishop's
proposal in an address to businessmen Thursday. He said his
government would abide by the 1980 constitution, which says the
commanders of the three armed forces and the national police will
make the nomination.
   Bishops of the Episcopal Conference recommended negotiations
because ``Chile is becoming polarized and radicalized'' and the
referendum might result in a virtual tie unless the opposition
accepts the nominee, whose name will be alone on the ballot.
   Leaders of an opposition alliance formed to promote a ``no''
vote in the referendum expressed willingness to negotiate about a
choice.
   If the nominee gets a majority of the yes-or-no vote, he will
begin an eight-year term in March. If he loses, Pinochet is to
remain in office until an open presidential election in 1990.
   Pinochet, 72, led a coup in September 1973 that ousted the late
President Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist.

   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, led all
candidates for Congress in contributions from political action
committees in the first 18 months of the current election cycle,
according to the Federal Election Commission.
   Bentsen's campaign for re-election to the Senate collected
almost $1.7 million in contributions from PACs between Jan. 1,
1987, and June 30, 1988, the FEC reported this week. Sen. Pete
Wilson, R-Calif., was second, with $1.14 million in PAC
contributions.
   Bentsen is also running a simultaneous race as the vice
presidential running mate of Democratic presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis, who does not accept contributions from PACs.
   Bentsen's spokesman, Jack DeVore, said the senator had no plans
to stop accepting PAC contributions for his Senate campaign because
Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, does not accept them.
   ``Governor Dukakis has said on many occasions he did not try to
select a clone,'' DeVore said.
   He said Bentsen's plans for the Senate contest ``were made long
before this vice presidential nomination came up and he will
proceed with them.''
   The senior senator from Texas, Bentsen has been chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee since January 1987. In that role, he is
influential in shaping tax and trade legislation that affects
business and industry nationwide.
   The FEC said the senator's campaign also took in almost $4.3
million in contributions from individuals in the 18-month period,
which combined with PAC money totals and other sources totaled
almost $6.3 million for his race against Republican Rep. Beau
Boulter.
   That total puts Bentsen in second place in contributions to
Senate candidates, behind only Wilson, who had more than $6.8
million.
   Bentsen has spent more than $3 million on the Senate race and
had more than $3.8 million cash on hand at the end of June, the FEC
report said.
   He ranks fourth in spending among Senate candidates and is
second place for cash on hand, it said.
   Boulter, meanwhile, has raised $587,319 and spent $582,745. He
had debts of $152,777 at the end of June and $14,097 cash on hand,
the FEC said.

<HEAD>Parliament Begins Final Debate on Trade Deal With US</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Final consideration of the U.S.-Canada Free Trade
Agreement began Friday with parliamentary debate on one of 102
amendments proposed by opposition parties trying to scuttle it.
   The agreement, which would scrap all duties over a 10-year
period and reduce non-tariff barriers, was proposed by Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney and accepted late last year by the Reagan
administration.
   It is scheduled to take effect Jan. 1, but Mulroney now faces a
much tougher job than President Reagan to getting the agreement
ratified.
   Enabling legislation passed the U.S. House of Representatives on
Tuesday by a vote of 366-40 and the Senate is expected to give its
approval next month.
   In Canada, the main opposition Liberal Party and the socialist
New Democratic Party claim the agreement jeopardizes Canadian
resources and could change the nation's way of life.
   They want Mulroney, leader of the Conservative Party, to call a
general election, which in effect would let the voters decide
whether the it should be accepted.
   Mulroney need not call an election until his five-year term
expires in 12 months, but Canadian governments generally seek a new
mandate after about four years. He said this this week he wants
free trade and other key legislation passed before he considers an
election date.
   His Conservatives are expected to use their large majority in
the House of Commons to cut delaying tactics short next week and
secure a third and final reading of the measure next week.
   The bill could get bogged down in the Senate, Canada's appointed
second chamber that has a Liberal majority. Liberal leader John
Turner has asked the Senate to delay the bill until an election.
   Friday's debate in the Commons began with a Liberal amendment
noting that the pact does not define Canadian boundaries,
especially disputed waters in the Arctic. The government dismissed
the amendment as frivolous and refused to join the debate.
   Rep. John LaFalce, a Democrat from Niagara Falls, N.Y. and a
free-trade supporter, told Congress this week ``a major trade war''
could start if Canada does not ratify the accord.
   David Peterson, the Liberal premier of Ontario, responded:
``It's the largest trading partnership in the world. I'm not saying
there wouldn't be some hard feelings, but that would pass.''

   Swedish prosecutors have issued an
arrest warrant for a purported terrorist of the Abu Nidal
organization but he is believed to have been killed in Greece last
month, a newspaper said Friday.
   Police suspect Samir Mohammed Khadar, a Palestinian who had
lived in Sweden since 1986, died in a bomb explosion July 11 in
Piraeus, the port of Athens, hours before a terrorist attack on a
cruise ship in which nine people were killed.
   News reports said Khadar planned the attack on the ship City of
Poros. He was said to be operations officer for the Abu Nidal
group, which issued a statement disclaiming responsibility.
   Prosecutor Torsten Jonsson issued a warrant for Khadar in the
murder of a Swedish passenger because positive identification of
Khadar's body was not possible, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet
reported.
   His office said Jonsson was not available for comment this
weekend.
   Krister Hansen, a Security Police officer, told the national
news agency TT ``we are 90 percent sure that Khadar is dead.''
   He said police learned Khadar lived in Sweden only after the
ship attack in Greece and a subsequent raid led them to an arms
cache in a forest. Newspapers said documents seized by police
linked Khadar to other terrorist attacks.
   Hansen told the news agency Sweden has become a base for
international terrorists, who can conceal themselves among the
thousands who seek political asylum here.
   ``Sweden is popular because of our open society,'' he said.
``It's easy to enter the country illegally, to stay here under a
false identity and its easy to leave without border controls.''

   Former Pennsylvania Gov. Richard L. Thornburgh
took office as the nation's 76th attorney general Friday with a vow
to ``make drug trafficking and drug abuse Public Enemy No. 1.''
   Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, one of the conservative
jurists appointed to the court by President Reagan, administered
the oath of office to Thornburgh in the Roosevelt Room of the White
House.
   Reagan saluted Thornburgh as an ex-prosecutor with ``a
nationwide reputation for attacking the drug problem head on and
cracking down on drug traffickers.''
   Thornburgh succeeds outgoing Attorney General Edwin Meese III,
who resigned after saying he had been vindicated by an independent
counsel investigation of his affairs.
   Reagan paid tribute to work done in the drug area by by both
Meese andd Vice President George Bush, the prospective Republican
presidential nominee.
   ``Under Vice President Bush's leadership, federal, state and
local law enforcement officials have been working together as never
before to stop drug runners from smuggling illegal drugs into the
United States,'' he said.
   ``The results of that work and the work that Attorney General
Meese led are incredible.''
   Bush was present at the swearing-in ceremony, but Meese did not
attend.
   Thornburgh swore his oath on a Bible once owned by William Penn,
the founder of Pennsylvania. It was held by his wife, Virginia.
   ``I firmly believe that unless we sustain a vigorous effort to
make drug trafficking and drug abuse Public Enemy No. 1, we could
well stunt significantly the capacity of today's young people to
contribute to a better quality of life for tomorrow's America,''
Thornburgh said.
   He said said he would use ``every resource of the Department of
Justice, consistent with strict observance of the civil rights and
civil liberties of all our citizens, to fight other unique threats
to our traditional values.''
   Thornburgh, 56, was confirmed by the Senate late Thursday.
   Meese's ethical behavior was investigated by Independent Counsel
James McKay, who concluded that the attorney general ``probably''
broke the law but decided not to seek his indictment. Meese denied
any improprieties, and maintained that the department was running
normally despite defections by top aides during his final months as
attorney general.
   Thornburgh headed the Justice Department's criminal division
during the Ford administration in the mid-1970s and established the
public integrity section that prosecutes corrupt public officials.

   A four-alarm chemical fire closed two
busy highways near San Jose and produced clouds of noxious smoke
that injured at least three people before firefighters brought it
under control, authorities said.
   A passing motorist was overcome by smoke and taken to a hospital
for treatment, said San Jose Police Sgt. Jim Morin. A firefighter
and a police officer also inhaled fumes and required treatment, he
said.
   The blaze was triggered by a small explosion at Altus Corp., a
battery manufacturer, about 1 p.m., and about 200 employees were
evacuated, said Jack Meral, a company vice president.
   He said clouds of smoke, which also forced the evacuation of
some nearby small businesses, were produced by the burning of a
chemical called thionylchloride and hydrochloric acid.
   ``Essentially, breathing the smoke might cause some repiratory
distress, burning in nasal passages, a cough, irritation of the
eyes,'' said Johnna Anderson of the San Jose Poison Control Center.
``It could cause problems for asthmatics or those with lung or
heart problems.''
   She said that those who might have suffered a severe exposure to
the fumes could find themselves coming down with pneumonia or other
viral or bacterial infections a few days or weeks later.
   ``When that delicate lining of the nose or mouth is burned, the
body has no more protection (against infection),'' she said.
   The blaze was controlled around 2:15 p.m., officials said.
   The Highway Patrol said Interstate 880 and Highway 101 near San
Jose were closed temporarily. A massive traffic jam ensued, with
motorists backed up for about 15 miles.
   At San Jose International Airport a few miles away, landings and
takeoffs were only slightly affected, said spokeswoman Marily Mora.
   Several thousand people visiting Great America Amusement Park,
about six miles away, were not evacuated.

<HEAD>Canada May Investigate Health Problems After U.S. Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GANDER, Newfoundland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canada's health minister said Friday
his staff is ready to investigate why emergency workers at a 1985
plane crash that killed 248 U.S. military personnel now complain of
mysterious health problems.
   Union official Robert Cox said firefighters, transport workers,
police and other rescuers have shown signs of a rare blood disorder
and other health problems since the crash.
   He said they believe the blood disorder could be related to
toxic fumes at at the site.
   The crash of a chartered jet at Gander on Dec. 12, 1985, was the
worst ever in Canada.
   In addition to the 248 troops from the U.S. Army's 101st
Airborne Division, it killed the eight crew members en on the DC-8
operated Arrow Air of Miami, a charter company specializing in
military passenger transport. The soldiers were returning from a
tour with peacekeeping forces in the Middle East.
   About 50 workers requested the investigation at a meeting
organized Thursday night by their union, the Public Service
Alliance of Canada.
   ``We are serving notice to the government of Canada: you have
the responsibility to your employees ... to identify what the
problem is,'' Cox said..
   Without an independent medical examination of everyone at the
crash site, it will be difficult to prove the ailments are linked
to the disaster, he said.
   Don Boudria, an opposition Liberal Party member of Parliament,
said at least 24 rescue workers were suffering strange maladies and
a full inquiry should be made.
   Health Minister Jake Epp said Friday in Ottawa his department
will conduct tests and ``do whatever is medically necessary'' when
it gets a formal request from the union.
   The plane refueled in Gander and crashed soon after takeoff. A
preliminary report by the Canadian Aviation Safety Board said
failure to de-ice the wings was the probable cause, but members of
Parliament and other sources said the confidential report omitted
evidence of a possible on-board explosion or fire.
   ``We have doctors' reports for some workers that say toxins were
present but there is no proof that it was from the crash,'' Cox
said.
   He said Thursday's union meeting ``established that a very high
percentage of people involved in the Arrow Air crash are now
experiencing medical problems of a similar nature.''
   ``The problems included high enzyme counts, blood problems, and
cardiovascular problems,'' Cox said. ``There definitely has to be a
link there somewhere.''

<HEAD>Solidarity Leader Sees Change in Government Attitude</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government recognized a foundation
conceived by Solidarity, pointing to a softening of its stand on
activists of the outlawed independent trade movement, one of the
movement's leaders said Thursday.
   However, Zbigniew Bujak said the labor movement still faces
major obstacles in regaining legal status. Bujak led Solidarity in
the Warsaw region until the movement was banned after martial law
was imposed in December 1981.
   In an unexpected move, the government earlier this week approved
registration of a foundation conceived by Bujak and other
Solidarity leaders to help large families in need, Bujak said.
   ``I was completely surprised. I didn't expect such a decision.
It's certainly connected with a general trend of change toward
Solidarity activists,'' he said.
   Bujak said government registration of a health care foundation
now being organized by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa would
represent an even greater step in the trade group's efforts to
regain legal status.
   ``Registration of Lech's foundation, connected even in name with
Solidarity, will be a huge step toward legalization of the whole
Solidarity,'' said Bujak.
   The foundation's plans to operate three health care clinics have
been delayed because the government had refused to recognize it.
   Walesa declined to discuss the future of the foundation.
   Worker protests in August 1980 led to creation of Solidarity,
the only free trade union movement in the Soviet bloc.
   While Solidarity activists continue to fight court battles to
restore the movement's legal status at the factory level, the
group's leaders are trying to create foundations to help Polish
society with money received as gifts or prizes from abroad.
   The courts so far have refused every factory-level request to
restore legal status to Solidarity itself.
   Last year, Bujak shared the annual human rights award of the
U.S.-based Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Foundation, which carries a
prize of $40,000.
   Bujak's foundation for needy families initially will dispose of
about $2,200.
   Walesa, the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize winner, and other Solidarity
leaders authorized creation of the Social Foundation for Workers
Solidarity last year to administer a $1 million grant from the U.S.
Congress.

   Republicans approved convention rule changes
Friday they hope will get them more exposure on television:
dispensing with needless roll call votes and allowing governors and
members of Congress on the convention floor.
   Unlike the Democrats, Republicans do not automatically give
delegate status to high-ranking elected officials, and under
current rules the convention floor seating is restricted to the
delegates.
   Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif., said it would be good to let the
politicians be seated on the floor of the convention so they could
``rub elbows with the backbone of the party.''
   But it's the reporters and the TV cameras that the politicians
are interested in.
   ``That's where the press is,'' said Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, who
sponsored the change to allow the politicians to have non-voting
seats on the convention floor. ``That's what we need to get
elected.''
   The rule change, if given final approval by the entire
convention, would not take effect until 1992.
   The other change, which would dispense with an hour-long roll
call for the vice presidential nomination if there is just one
candidate, was designed to conserve precious prime time on the TV.
   That rule change, requested by Vice President Bush's campaign,
takes immediate effect if approved by the convention and would
allow the Republicans to forego a Thursday night roll call next
week.

   Anti-communist Afghan guerrillas have
captured Kunduz, a strategic provincial capital in northeastern
Afghanistan, according to an unconfirmed report cited Friday by
Western diplomats.
   The Moslem insurgents, who usually are the first to publicize
their takeovers of Afghan towns even when they are temporary, have
said nothing about capturing Kunduz, the capital of Kunduz province.
   Kunduz, about 150 miles north of the Afghan capital of Kabul,
would be a significant gain for the guerrillas fighting the
Soviet-backed government.
   The city, 40 miles south of the Soviet border on the main
highway leading from Kabul to the Soviet Union, would be the first
Afghan provincial capital the rebels have won in the 10-year war.
   Most Soviet troops leaving the country under an April 14
U.N.-sponsored withdrawal agreement are taking another road to the
border at Heiratan, about 100 miles west of Kunduz.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 and have been
helping the Marxist government battle the guerrillas. The Soviets
agreed to withdraw half their estimated 100,000 troops by Monday
under a pullout plan that began May 15 and is to be completed by
Feb. 15.
   State-run Radio Kabul said foreign journalists and local Afghans
witnessed ``hundreds'' of Red Army soldiers cross into the Soviet
Union on Thursday and Friday.
   The radio reported that a Pakistani national was arrested
Thursday for espionage as he carried two explosive devices in the
eastern city of Jalalabad. The government-controlled Bakhtar News
Agency said the unidentified Pakistani led Afghan army forces to a
guerrilla ammunition depot in Caprahar, six miles south of
Jalalabad.
   Radio Kabul also said two Pakistanis were among 70 people killed
during a clash between Afghan army troops and U.S.-backed Moslem
guerrillas in eastern Logar province. There was no information on
when the fighting occurred.
   It described the two Pakistanis as ``advisers'' to the
guerrillas.
   Azim Nasser Zia of the National Islamic Front of Afghanistan
resistance organization said guerrillas who arrived about 10 days
ago from Kunduz said nothing of the capital's capture or its
vulnerability to an imminent guerrilla takeover.
   The Afghan News Agency, which claims to be a mouthpiece of the
seven-party guerrilla alliance but is operated by members of
Gulbadin Hekmatyar's Hezb-e-Islami, also could not confirm the
capture of Kunduz. The loose and often fractured resistance
alliance is based in Peshawar in northwest Pakistan.
   A strategic gain in Afghanistan's resource-rich north would
dampen any hopes the Afghan government might have for the north as
a fallback position if it is unable to hold Kabul.
   Western diplomats said Kabul might have designs on the north
after the government began heavy construction in the northern city
of Mazar-e-Sharif, appointed a deputy prime minister for the north
and consolidated its fighting forces under a single command.
   Afghan insurgents temporarily captured two provincial capitals
in southern and eastern Afghanistan since the Soviet withdrawal
began, but they were pushed back after heavy bombing attacks,
Western diplomats said.
   Pakistan, which has an estimated 2.5 million Afghan refugees as
well as guerrilla headquarters, signed the withdrawal agreement in
Geneva with the Afghan government. The United States, which backs
the insurgency, and the Soviet Union agreed to act as guarantors.
   The insurgents have said they will ignore the Geneva accord and
keep fighting until the government falls.
   Pakistan's foreign minister, Sahabzada Yaqub Khan, said Friday
that Pakistan is fully committed to the agreement and a political
settlement in Afghanistan.
   He said Soviet accusations Pakistan had violated the accord were
``false, motivated and propagandist.'' The Soviets have accused
Pakistan of continuing to channel weapons to the guerrillas.
   Khan said the accord carries the promise of the complete
withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan, the return of peace
and independence and the safe return of refugees.

   Gov. Mario Cuomo said Friday that he may
yet remove from office the Yonkers city councilmen who are defying
a federal judge over an order to promote racial integration by
building 800 units of affordable housing.
   ``We certainly will not rule out removal by any means,'' the
governor said after meetings with the Yonkers NAACP and the
editorial board of the Gannett Westchester Rockland Newspapers.
   Federal and state officials, such as Sens. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan and Alfonse D'Amato, should help persuade Yonkers to build
both low- and moderate-income housing, Cuomo said.
   The people of Yonkers ``have to have leadership locally and
otherwise that shows them the way, that shows them they can have
this housing, that shows them they can do the right thing by the
poor people without threatening their own property,'' the governor
said.
   ``No one needs to suffer a loss to find housing for 200 families
in a city as great as Yonkers,'' he said. Yonkers, the state's
fourth-largest city, has a population of 195,000.
   If an appeals court upholds a contempt finding next week, he
said, the recalcitrant council members should consider resigning.
   Cuomo said his role would be defined by U.S. District Judge
Leonard Sand, who found the city liable for segregating housing and
schools for 40 years.
   ``It's his jurisdiction,'' the governor said.
   Sand also found the city and four councilmen in contempt for
failing to endorse a resolution to build 800 units of affordable
housing to break the pattern of segregation.
   Each councilman was fined $500 daily. The city was fined $100 a
day, with fines to double daily. By the 22nd day of the fines, the
city would face the total elimination of its $337 million budget.
   But a three-judge appeals panel stayed the fines pending a full
hearing on the contempt order next week.
   Cuomo said he wanted to await the outcome of the appeals court
before taking any action. To remove elected officials is a lengthy
process, he observed.
   Earlier this week, the Yonkers Emergency Financial Control
Board, imposed to oversee city spending four years ago as a
condition of a bailout to stave off bankruptcy, assumed the reins
of city spending.
   It could find the officials in violation of the control board
act and set into motion a removal process, said Cuomo. However, he
stopped short of saying it would.

   Football star Mark Gastineau and actress
Brigitte Nielsen announced Friday that they plan a winter wedding,
as soon as his divorce is final.
   It will be a small, private ceremony attended by ``true
friends,'' Nielsen said at a crowded news conference.
   ``We want something very romantic,'' said Nielsen, 25, who
recently was divorced from actor Sylvester Stallone and has a
4{-year-old son, Julian, who lives with his father, her first
husband, in her native Denmark.
   No date has been set for the nuptials because Gastineau, a New
York Jets defensive end, has yet to sever his marriage to his first
wife, Lisa, a model. They split in 1986 and have a daughter,
Britanny, 5.
   Gastineau and Nielsen were rumored to have had an on-again
off-again engagement after they met during the Super Bowl in
January, but this time it's ``true love,'' they beamed, kissing in
front of hordes of television lights and photographers.
   The couple acknowledged last month's reports that as a symbol of
their eternal love, they have had their names tatooed on each
others buttocks.
   ``It means I really love this person and I'm going to be with
her for eternity,'' said Gastineau, 31, who is attending Jets
training camp at Hofstra University in Hempstead.
   ``I can really call this true love,'' said the bride-to-be, who
proudly showed off her ring, diamonds in the shape of a nine,
reminiscent of Gastineau's jersey number, 99. ``I am the happiest I
have ever been.''
   ``We want lots of kids, 10 of them,'' declared Nielsen, who said
her movie career will be secondary to ``being with Mark.''
   She had a miscarriage last May while filming in Rome.
   ``The miscarriage is one of the most misfortunate things that
ever happened to both of us,'' said Gastineau. ``It tore us apart.''

   Gunmen shot and killed a British soldier
Friday night as he sat in his car at a traffic light in this North
Sea port city, Belgian and British officials said.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility. But suspicion fell
on the Irish Republican Army, which on Aug. 1 stepped up its
campaign against members of British security forces.
   The soldier was hit by five bullets when he stopped his vehicle
at the traffic light, the a Belgian news agency Belga reported. It
said the vehicle had British license plates and pulled a trailer.
   A Belgian police official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said initial details of the shooting were sketchy. But he said
authorities were looking for two men about 25 years old who were
seen running away after the killing.
   The police official said ``it was not excluded'' the shooting
was the work of the IRA.
   The British Ministry of Defense, in a statement in London,
confirmed that the soldier was killed at he waited at a traffic
light.
   The ministry statement said he was on leave from his unit in
West Germany and was on his way home to Britain. Many British
servicemen stationed in West Germany pass through the English
Channel port of Ostend on their way to and from Britain.
   Identification of the victim was withheld until his relatives
are informed.
   This summer, the outlawed IRA has claimed responsibility for a
series of attacks against British military personnel in both Great
Britain and on the Continent.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
Northern Ireland. It wants to unite the province, which has a
Protestant majority, with the mainly Catholic Irish Republic.
   The IRA began its stepped-up campaign against members of the
British security forces on Aug. 1, when it bombed a barracks in
North London, killing one soldier and injuring nine others.
   The campaign continued with a series of separate attacks in
Northern Ireland last week in which the IRA killed a policeman, two
part-time soldiers of the Ulster Defense Regiment and two
Protestant civilians who were doing maintenance work on a police
station.

   Protesters damning ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' marched
behind a mannequin dressed as Jesus, carried crosses, taunted
moviegoers and splattered a theater with paint and glue as the
movie opened in nine cities Friday.
   In New York, Toronto and Los Angeles, uniformed security guards
checked the purses and bags of movie patrons.
   Guards were stationed at each side of the screen at the Ziegfeld
Theater in New York, where about 100 protesters demonstrated,
including a man who denounced moviegoers as ``reprobates'' and
``homosexuals.''
   ``I believe that as Judas sold him (Jesus) out the first time,
that Hollywood is selling him out the second time,'' said
demonstrator Carol Sergio of Queens.
   Rabbi Yosef Friedman, an Orthodox Jew, carried a sign reading,
``Rabbis Protest Mockery of Any Religion.''
   ``We see it as an attack on morality and traditional family
values,'' Friedman said of the film. We feel these people who are
mocking Christianity today would also be willing to mock Judaism.''
   However, movie patrons vastly outnumbered the protesters in all
areas, standing in lines by the hundreds and buying out the first
screenings of the film based on the 1955 novel by Greek author
Nikos Kazantzakis. Directed by Martin Scorsese, it stars Willem
Dafoe as Jesus, Barbara Hershey as Mary Magdalene and Harvey Keitel
as Judas.
   Some Christians have branded it blasphemous for its portrayal of
a doubting Jesus, who, in a dream sequence, has sex with Mary
Magdalene.
   In Washington, D.C., about 30 people waved placards and marched
behind a mannequin dressed as Jesus outside a theater where the
early afternoon show was a sellout, officials said.
   One protester, Rita Warren of Falls Church, Va., said she hoped
people would be discouraged from seeing the film but did not think
it should be banned.
   ``They have a right to see it as much as we have a right to be
here protesting against it,'' she said.
   Although a demonstration by 25,000 people at Universal Studios
was peaceful on Thursday, 75 Los Angeles police officers monitored
the movie house where ``Last Temptation'' opened Friday.
   Vandals tossed paint at the Century Plaza Theater about 5 a.m.,
splattering the building and a glass-enclosed movie poster with
yellow paint, said Fabian Munez, head of the firm that provides
security for the ABC Entertainment Center, where the theater is
located.
   Police Cmdr. William Booth said no officers would be inside the
theater in Century City despite fears of slashed or spray-painted
screens.
   By noon someone had spread glue on the floor in the women's rest
room, said theater patron Jo Drott, 24.
   The 200 protesters included children with ``I Love Jesus''
T-shirts who sang ``The Battle Hymn of the Republic'' and mothers
who pushed strollers with such taped-on signs as ``Don't Crucify
Jesus Again.''
   One huge poster aimed at Universal's parent company, MCA Inc.,
said: ``The Last Temptation of Christ will do for MCA What Pearl
Harbor Did for Japan: They Started a War and Lost it.''
   Catherine Romero, 19, of Whittier taped a sign to her chest that
said ``I Love Jesus but that doesn't stop me from having an open
mind.'' She said she was raised a Catholic and her mother, a church
choir director, encouraged her to see the film.
   ``This morning my mother said `Go ahead, be careful, keep an
open mind and make up your own mind,''' she said.
   Hundreds of people waited in line for the first showing of the
movie in San Francisco, which sold out. But only about a dozen
protesters were outside the NorthPoint Theater at Fisherman's Wharf.
   ``I wanted to see the first show so that I could tell all my
Christian friends that they can come see it without believing the
propaganda that they are receiving in the mail,'' said Chuck
Hilbert of San Francisco.
   About 50 demonstrators gathered outside a theater in Chicago,
where the Rev. Nikitas Lulias, chancellor of the 200,000-member
Greek Orthodox diocese said, ``We have called upon our people to go
with prayer in their hearts _ that God might anoint these
individuals to stop showing the film.''
   In Toronto, an actor challenged the protesters by waving $20
bills and offering to buy them tickets to see the film. The only
takers, however, were four ordinary filmgoers.

River and at least 10 women died, it was reported Friday. The
incident happened near where more than 400 people drowned in a
ferry accident last week.
   The latest accident occurred Thursday in the Begusarai district
in the northeastern state of Bihar, United News of India said.
   The victims were grass-cutters crossing the Ganges to reach
clusters of wild grass, it said.
   It did not say how many people were on the boat or why it
capsized.
   More than 400 people drowned Aug. 6 when a ferry crossing the
river at Katihar, also in Bihar state, capsized after hitting a
sand bar.
   The Ganges has been flooded since the annual monsoon gripped the
region in June.

   The hot weather continued to pound out record high temperatures
Friday, especially in Michigan, and humidity reached almost
unbearable levels along the Ohio Valley and the northern Atlantic
Coast.
   Cloudiness and scattered showers and thunderstorms, remnants of
the former tropical storm Beryl, kept temperatures down Friday in
the south-central part of the nation, including western Missouri
and eastern Kansas.
   The Pacific Northwest escaped the heat Friday with temperatures
in the Portland and Seattle areas in the 70s.
   Overnight temperatures Thursday only dropped to the 75 to 80
degree range from Boston to northern New Jersey. The low
temperature at Portland, Maine, has been 60 degrees or higher for
20 consecutive days, the longest streak of low temperatures of 60
degrees or higher.
   Williamsport, Pa., and Detroit tied their record number of days
with 90 degrees or higher in one summer. It was the 37th day for
Williamsport and the 36th day for Detroit.
   Southeast Oklahoma received about 7 inches of rain over a
five-hour period.
   Showers and thunderstorms developed across much of the eastern
half of the nation but were scattered. Thunderstorms were
concentrated in the Ohio Valley, the north Atlantic states, western
portions of the central Plains and the northern Rockies.
   Showers and thunderstorms also extended across the southern
Atlantic and Gulf Coast states.
   Rainfall during the six hours ended at 2 p.m. EDT included 1\
inches at Apalochicola, Fla.; two-thirds of an inch at Keesler Air
Force Base in Biloxi, Miss.; and about a half-inch at Cincinnati.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 56
degrees at Santa Rosa, Calif., and Crescent City, Calif., to 102
degrees at Phoenix, Ariz. The nation's low Friday morning was 34
degrees at Truckee, Calif.
   Records for the day included 86 degrees in Alpena, Mich., and 87
in Beckley, W.Va.
   Saturday's forecast called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms along the southern Atlantic Coast and southern
Georgia, Florida and Alabama to the lower Mississippi Valley.
Scattered showers and thunderstorms were also predicted from
Montana across the Great Plains, the upper and middle Mississippi
Valley and the Great Lakes region to the north Atlantic coastal
states. Showers and thunderstorms were expected to be numerous from
central Missouri to the upper Mississippi Valley.
   High temperatures were forecast in the upper 80s and 90s across
most of the nation. Highs were expected in the upper 70s to mid 80s
in Maine, the northern Great Lakes, northern Minnesota and in
portions of the West. Readings were expected to only reach the
upper 60s and 70s in the Pacific Northwest and along the California
coast. Highs were to be over 100 degrees in parts of the southern
Plains and in the desert Southwest.

<HEAD>ABC Poll Puts Presidential Race In Dead Heat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ABC News poll Friday put the presidential
race at 49 percent for George Bush to 46 percent for Michael
Dukakis, an evaporation of Dukakis' big post-Democratic convention
lead.
   The survey Wednesday and Thursday of 384 likely registered
voters had a relatively high margin of sampling error, 6 percentage
points, meaning the race was statistically a dead heat.
   Four other national polls released this week showed support for
Dukakis dropping off from its peak after last month's Democratic
convention in Atlanta, with leads for the Massachusetts governor
ranging from 6 points to 14 points.
   Dukakis, boosted by good publicity, led by as many as 18 points
the week after the convention. ``Michael Dukakis did as well as you
can out of a convention,'' said Jeff Alderman, ABC's chief
pollster. ``It's not surprising that would shrink.''
   Alderman said the ABC survey found most of Bush's growth in
support among voters who identified themselves as independents. He
said their movement reflected an ambivalence about the candidates.
   ``Fifteen to 20 percent of the electorate is lightly attached to
either of these candidates, and those voters are capable of
swinging back and forth,'' he said. ``Either one could be ahead.''

   Israeli troops Friday fired on three
Palestinians attacking with chains, clubs and an ax in the occupied
Gaza Strip, killing one assailant and wounding another in the leg,
the army said.
   Leaders of Israel's two major political parties intensified
debate on the future of the West Bank and Gaza Strip after King
Hussein's decision to cut Jordan's ties with Palestinians in the
occupied lands.
   Friday's clash began shortly after midnight in Gaza's Mughazi
refugee camp, an army spokesman said. He said the dead man, Riad
Suleiman Abu Mandil, 23, had participated in anti-Israeli protests
and attacks on soldiers in the past.
   The death brought to 240 the number of Palestinians killed since
the Arab rebellion in the occupied lands began Dec. 8. Four
Israelis also have been killed.
   Israeli military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said troops apparently caught the Arabs by surprise as they were
painting anti-Israeli slogans on camp walls. The officials said
soldiers opened fire when the Palestinians attacked the troops with
clubs, chains and an ax.
   They said Mandil fled from the army patrol after being wounded
and may have bled to death. An autopsy was ordered.
   Troops also arrested the third member of the Palestinian group,
the officials said.
   In an interview with Israel's armed forces radio, Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres said Israel had to decide in elections Nov. 1
to pursue peace before arguing about the choice of an Arab
negotiating partner.
   ``What does Israel want _ to take a peace initiative or to sit
idly and let the Arabs and the Russians and the whole world run our
affairs? If we do not take the initiative _ and that's actually
what the Likud proposes _ others will take it,'' warned Peres, the
head of the liberal Labor Party.
   Peres said he still believed Jordan had to be a negotiating
partner, despite Hussein's declaration that he will not bargain on
behalf of the Palestinians.
   ``We have always thought we should conduct negotiations both
with Jordan and the Palestinians, as Jordan is responsible for the
main border and the Palestinians are the ones who bear the main
burden of the Palestinian problem,'' Peres said.
   In an interview with the Jerusalem Post daily, Industry Minister
Ariel Sharon of the right-wing Likud bloc argued the ``only
realistic policy'' was to consider Jordan a Palestinian state since
most of its 3.5 million people are Palestinians.
   ``We have to object in the strongest possible way to attempts to
foist on us a second Palestinian state to our east,'' Sharon said.
   Sharon, who has a wide following among Israel's hard-liners,
proposed that Israel annex portions of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, saying most Israelis agree that much of the territory is
needed for security reasons.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has ruled out repeated calls by
right-wingers to annex the West Bank in response to Hussein's
measures.
   Prime Minister Zaid Rifai of Jordan met in Amman with a
high-level Palestine Liberation Organization delegation to discuss
Jordan's move to cut ties with the occupied lands.
   A senior PLO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
they discussed Jordanian passports held by Palestinians, the rights
of employees in the occupied territories dismissed by Jordan and
``the implications of these measures on the future of
Palestinians.''
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat met with Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Gadhafi in Tripoli, the official Libyan news agency JANA said.
   The agency, monitored in Rome, said the two leaders discussed
financial aid for Palestinians in the occupied lands. Gadhafi said
this week that Libya will pay the salaries of 21,200 Palestinian
officials who had been paid by Jordan.

   ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' opened in
nine cities Friday amid tight security that included guards
standing as sentries alongside movie screens and theater patrons
being searched.
   Thousands of Christians furiously objected to the film, saying
it depicts Jesus as filled with doubts and lust, while some critics
praised it as a masterpiece.
   Filmgoers snaked around streets by the thousands for tickets to
the first showings, vastly outnumbering the protesters who turned
out in several cities.
   Uniformed security guards checked purses and bags of movie
patrons in New York, Los Angeles and Toronto, and guards also stood
alongside screens in those cities, but no disturbances were
reported.
   In New York, Rabbi Yosef Friedman, an Orthodox Jew, carried a
sign in front of the Ziegfeld Theater that read, ``Rabbis Protest
Mockery of Any Religion,'' while in Chicago, about 50 demonstrators
gathered.
   About 30 protesters in Washington, D.C., waved placards and
marched behind a mannequin of Jesus, while dozens of demonstrators
gathered outside theaters in San Francisco and Chicago.
   Although a demonstration by 25,000 Christians at Universal
Studios was peaceful and polite Thursday, 75 Los Angeles police
officers monitored the crowds at the Century Plaza Theater and
security guards checked purses and bags of movie patrons.
   Police Cmdr. William Booth said no officers will be in the
theater in Century City despite fears of slashed or spray-painted
screens.
   Vandals tossed balloons filled with paint at the Century City
theater about 5 a.m., splattering it with yellow paint, said
security guard Fabian Munez. By noon, someone had spread glue on
the floor in the women's rest room, said patron Jo Drott, 24.
   Hours before the film was to open, a group of directors
including Warren Beatty, James L. Brooks, Peter Bogdanovich,
Michael Mann, Sydney Pollack and Walter Hill called a news
conference to express support for the film's director, Martin
Scorsese.
   ``We owe a debt of gratitude to this group of somewhat misguided
zealots. The film now will be seen by a lot of curiosity-seekers,''
said John Badham, director of ``Short Circuit'' and ``WarGames.''
``What is not terrific is their effort to rewrite the Bill of
Rights.''
   The Directors Guild of America was the latest group to enter the
fray, which has spread from the studio lots to Congress to churches
nationwide.
   Protesters have declaimed the film as sacrilege, saying it
portrays Christ as a deranged and lust-driven human, who while
being crucified, dreams he marries and has sex with Mary Magdalene
and lives his life as an ordinary man.
   Cardinal Bernard Law, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Boston,
urged Catholics to boycott the film, calling it ``morally offensive
and repugnant to Christian belief.''
   ``It is inconceivable to me that a person of faith in Jesus
Christ would go to this movie,'' Law wrote in the archdiocese
newspaper. ``One way to be heard is by not going. Another way is to
write the producers.''
   But proponents say the film illustrates the central mystery of
Christianity, showing a fully human Jesus wrestling with doubts and
temptation, then rising above them to accept his role as God's son,
willingly crucified so the rest of humanity may be forgiven its sin.
   Willem Dafoe, who portrays Jesus in the film, said he is baffled
by protesters' complaints.
   ``I just think this is a beautiful, powerful, positive film.
Some people that for the most part haven't seen it are coming out
against it _ that I don't understand,'' he said in an interview on
NBC-TV's ``Today'' program.
   Universal Studios has accused the protesters of censorship for
asking the studio to destroy the film. In a suprise move, the
studio moved up the release date from Sept. 23 to Friday, saying it
wanted the public to judge the movie for itself but perhaps also
wishing to capitalize on the publicity.
   Church leaders opposing the movie have primarily been Protestant
evangelicals and conservative Catholics, many of whom have refused
to watch it. The Mormon Church also condemned the film Friday,
saying it ``trivializes the message and mission of Jesus Christ.''
   Other Christian leaders, such as the Episcopal bishop of New
York, said after a screening that they had no objections to the
release of the movie, and some said it was an enlightening or
educational tool.
   Film critics also had mixed opinions, some calling it
overwrought and boring at two hours, 40 minutes, others calling it
the most impressive biblical epic ever.
   Richard Corliss of Time magazine said Scorsese ``may have
created his masterpiece'' while Michael Medved of ``Sneak
Previews'' said it was ironic that so much controversy could be
generated ``by a movie this awful.''
   The movie opened Friday in nine major markets _ Los Angeles,
Chicago, Washington, San Francisco, Seattle, Minneapolis, New York,
Toronto and Montreal. Universal spokesman said no decision has been
made whether to add other cities next week.
   Several movie chains have refused to book the film, including
the Newton, Mass.-based General Cinema Theaters, the nation's
fourth-largest movie chain with 1,338 screens in 318 locations. The
company refused to say why, however.
   On Friday, The Wometco exhibition chain, which has more than 90
screens in Florida, said it also had chosen not to screen the film.
   Garth Drabinsky, chairman of Toronto-based Cineplex Odeon, which
is showing the film and is co-distributor, said supression of the
film would signal the beginning of the decline and fall of the
motion picture industry.
   Scorsese, a Roman Catholic, says his film is an affirmation of
faith that he hoped would provoke people to think about Jesus as a
man confronting temptation.
   Based on the 1955 novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, which was
denounced as heresy by the Greek Orthodox church, ``Last
Temptation'' has had a long journey to the big screen. Director
Sidney Lumet acquired the rights to the novel in 1971 but abandoned
the project because of difficulties in writing the screenplay.
   Barbara Hershey, who plays Mary Magdalene, urged Scorsese to
read the novel while she was filming ``Boxcar Bertha'' with him in
1972, and that began his 15-year quest to make the movie.
   During the journey, such actors as Robert DeNiro, Eric Roberts,
Aidan Quinn and even Sylvester Stallone were suggested for the role
of Jesus.

   A fire Friday that spread smoke through the
upper floors of the 102-story Empire State Building forced 1,500
tourists out into the steamy city streets before it was put out two
hours later.
   At least eight radio stations with antennas on the building were
temporarily knocked off the air by the fire.
   The fire broke out about 1 p.m. in a utility room on the 86th
floor of the skyscraper and spread up a shaft to the top floor, the
Fire Department said.
   Three firefighters required treatment for heat and smoke in the
93-degree weather, and one was taken to a hospital, said fire
spokesman John Mulligan. One building occupant suffered a cut on
the arm but declined threatment, he said.
   ``It was really nothing unusual _ just very smoky and very
hot,'' said Homer Bishop, acting fire chief.
   There was no general evacuation and no one was trapped, but
people from the smokier upper floors were brought out. Elevator
service was not disrupted.
   Some 1,500 tourists visiting the popular observation decks on
the 86th and 102nd floors were among those told to leave the
building, said Nick Cavatoro, a spokesman for the building owners.
He said the decks would reopen Saturday.
   Fifth Avenue traffic was backed up for more than 20 blocks north
of 34th Street. The Fire Department had 40 trucks and 125
firefighters at the scene.
   ``There was lots and lots of smoke, but that's all. It was
coming out the vents,'' said Tracie Ricks, who works on the 65th
floor.
   ``Everyone was kind of nervous. But there was no problem getting
out,'' said a co-worker, Karen Mial.
   Bishop described damage as moderate in the utility shaft.
   George Wolfson, general manager and vice president of WLTW-FM,
said the eight radio stations knocked off the air resumed
broadcasting by 6 p.m. at reduced power. He said they would remain
at reduced power until burned transmission lines were repaired.
   The 86th floor blaze was under control at 1:43 p.m., the fire
department said, but five minutes later, fire was discovered on the
top floor.
   Efforts to put it out were stymied for a time by lack of
pressure because a pump on the 84th floor was not working properly,
officials said.
   ``The greatest difficulty up there was the extreme heat and
humidity,'' a sweat-soaked firefighter, Mark Keisey, said as he
left the skyscraper. ``At times it felt like we were on our last
legs.''
   The Empire State Building is probably best-known as the site
where movie ape King Kong made his last stand.
   Its most serious real-life disaster occurred July 28, 1945, when
a U.S. Army B25 bomber, lost over Manhattan in fog, crashed into
the building's 79th floor. Three plane crewmen and 11 civilians
died and 26 were injured as flaming gasoline bathed the 78th and
79th floors that Saturday.
   The structure, built in 1930-31, for years was the tallest
building in the world.

   George Bush and Michael Dukakis swapped charges on the economy
Friday while Republicans finessed a disagreement over Star Wars in
completing a conservative platform the vice president will take
from next week's New Orleans convention into the fall campaign.
   GOP chairman Frank Fahrenkopf said the platform reflected Bush's
call for a ``new direction'' in some areas. Still, he added,
``We're a conservative political party. We're proud of that. We're
not afraid of the `c' word.''
   But Leslie Dach, a top aide to Dukakis, said in Boston the
Republicans had produced ``a right-wing platform mired in the
past.''
   Bush met privately with advisers to discuss topic No. 1 on the
minds of Republicans _ his choice of a running mate _ but offered
no public clue. In Illinois, Gov. Jim Thompson announced he did not
wish to be considered for the post.
   ``The vice president's job requires a lot of national and
international travel,'' he said. ``My wife couldn't travel with me
because I've got a 10-year-old in school...''
   An ABC poll reported Bush and Dukakis in a statistical dead
heat, with Bush at 49 percent support and Dukakis at 46, a margin
smaller than the poll's six-point margin of error. Several other
polls this week have reported Dukakis leading, although by less
than in the days following the Democratic Convention.
   Both Bush and Dukakis were pointing their efforts toward next
week _ the vice president by previewing the convention themes of
peace and prosperity and his Democratic rival by airing the first
television commercials of the fall campaign in Texas and California
in a bid to take the sting out of an attack the GOP will launch
against him from New Orleans.
   Fahrenkopf urged Bush to make a dramatic announcement of his
choice of a running mate Wednesday night after the convention
bestows its presidential nomination. Bush has been saying he would
wait until Thursday morning to announce his decision and would not
tell ``a soul'' in advance.
   Bush, campaigning in Washington, told Reagan administration
loyalists he stands for ``low taxes and high opportunity'' for all
and accused Democrats of favoring policies that would doom the
economic recovery. Dukakis, completing a five-state campaign sweep,
fired back that Republican ``borrowing and spending'' caused this
week's rise in interest rates.
   Dukakis said climbing interest rates were an ``irresponsibility
tax'' forced on Americans by deficit spending of the Reagan era.
``...We deserve an explanation from the Republicans at that
convention about what they're doing to the American people,'' he
said.
   Heat, humidity and elephants of all shapes and sizes were in
abundance in the convention city, where Republicans will flock next
week to nominate Bush and his vice presidential partner. One red,
white and blue inflated plastic pachyderm was anchored atop a hotel
overlooking the vast Superdome convention hall.
   The politicians weren't the only ones looking forward to the
convention. ``There are going to be a lot of men at this
convention, they said, so it'll be good for us,'' said Bonnie
Holloway, a dancer at a New Orleans go-go club.
   Republican platform writers completed a 30,000 work blueprint
for the future that they said was far more specific than the one
approved by the Democrats last month. Officials released a list of
125 issues that they said Democrats had ignored.
   Republicans sidestepped a dispute over Star Wars when the Bush
forces agreed to accept a draft penned by conservatives that called
for ``rapid and certain deployment'' of the missile defense system.
   The platform also rules out higher taxes and expresses firm
opposition to abortion.
   Bush and Reagan staged a joint appearance before Cabinet
officers and senior appointees of the administration, with Bush
appealing for their help in the fall campaign.
   ``If we state in plain terms the case for low taxes and high
opportunity, for a strong America and a peaceful world, I believe
we'll have another Republican victory in November,'' he said.
   Bush said that the ``McGovern or Carter or Mondale
Democrats...are just itching to get back into the game....
   ``Given the chance, I am convinced that they would repeal the
tax cuts that we've worked so hard to enact and defend, and that
would defeat and simply bury this recovery,'' he said.
   ``Measure us by our performance. Peace is breaking out all over
the world. Earlier this week, on the same day, the headlines
announced not one, but two cease-fires in very troubled areas of
the world _ one between Iran and Iraq, and one between Angola, Cuba
and South Africa.''
   Reagan said he would crisscross the country this fall to help
Bush.
   ``The other folks talk; George Bush will deliver. The truth is
that what we've achieved is just the beginning, the best is yet to
come,'' he said.
   Dukakis, campaigning in Virginia, stepped up his criticism of
Reagan administration spending policies and said interest rates
will continue to rise ``if we continue to live on a credit card.
   ``As we all know, sooner or later the bill collector comes to
the door,'' the Massachusetts governor said.
   Dukakis has been criticized in Virginia because he opposes
construction of two new Navy supercarrier task forces which would
be built at the Newport News, Va., shipyard. Gov. Gerald L. Baliles
said he parted company with the presidential candidate on that
point but added, ``I have no doubts, no reservations and no
hesitations,'' about Dukakis on his commitment to national security.
   Dukakis aides also said the campaign was airing the first
television commercials of the general election campaign in Texas
and California in the three days leading up to the Republican
National Convention.
   ``By working together to create opportunity and a good life for
all, all of us are enriched _ not just in economic terms, but as
citizens and as human beings,'' Dukakis says in the ad.
   Dukakis running mate Lloyd Bentsen appealed to Hispanic voters
for support as he began a week-long stint of double-duty
campaigning in Texas. Bentsen is seeking re-election to his Senate
seat from Texas as well as running for vice president.

   Typhoon related floods and torrential rains have
killed at least 1,406 Chinese this summer, an official report said
Friday quoting a government spokesman.
   The spokesman for the Central Flood Control Headquarters said
more than 17.3 million acres of farmland have been flooded, causing
$1.2 billion in economic losses, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported.
   It did not say how this year's disaster toll compared with those
of past years.
   However, the loss of life is believed to be the heaviest since
1981 when 3,000 residents were reported killed by floods in
southwest China's Sichuan province.
   Since the end of July, at least 264 people perished in flash
floods in coastal Zhejiang province, more than 50 lost their lives
in floods in central China's Shanxi province and 110 were killed by
a typhoon that battered Zhejiang, according to Xinhua.
   The Flood Control spokesman, who was not identified, said the
rains have filled reservoirs and ended a drought that parched much
of central China. But he also said some 28 million acres, about 10
percent of all of China's cultivated land, still have water
shortages.

considered to be the most acerbic of his contemporaries, who
included Louella Parsons, Hedda Hopper and Walter Winchell.
   His shows featured stories about stars, movie critiques and his
trademark sign-off: ``Good night to you ... and you ... and I do
mean you!''
   At his peak in 1950 Fidler was earning more than $250,000 a year
and was heard over 486 stations by 40 million people a week. His
syndicated gossip column appeared in 360 newspapers.
   His show featured a four-bell system for rating new films,
``open letters'' to movie stars in which he critiqued their
performances and their behavior and ``notes from the little black
book.''
   Fidler took pride in being disliked by Hollywood and credited a
network of spies for giving him gossip. ``I had secretaries in
studios all over town who would supply me with stories for bonuses
of $25 to $100,'' he once said.
   He wrote his first column in 1920 for the Hollywood News, a
four-page insert to the old Los Angeles Express.
   Fidler was once a movie extra with ambitions of becoming a star.
He first got attention as a publicity man for Famous Players-Lasky,
the forerunner of Paramount.
   Assigned to Cecil B. DeMille, he reportedly once increased
profits for DeMille's films by telling the news media that the
movie mogul had loaded his yacht with rifles and was taking it to
Mexico to hunt cannibals.
   Fidler later ran his own talent agency until it was wiped out by
the stock market crash of 1929.
   He returned to public relations and was asked to interview a
Hollywood starlet for the NBC radio show ``Hollywood on the Air.''
   After more than 2,000 letters poured in praising the effort, he
was given his own 15-minute show.
   He began to cut back his broadcasts in the 1960s but didn't
retire from the air until 1983.
   He is survived by his wife, Kay, three daughters and four
grandchildren.

   Democratic vice presidential nominee
Lloyd Bentsen returned to his home state Friday to ask Hispanic
voters for support as he began a week of Texas campaigning that
will keep him visible while the Republican National Convention
dominates the national political scene.
   ``Texas is a real battleground, that's obvious,'' Bentsen said
as he arrived in San Antonio several hours late because of a delay
leaving Washington.
   In remarks prepared for delivery Friday night before the
Southwest Voter Registration Project, the Texas senator said,
``Given the importance of the Hispanic community in this election,
it is safe to assume that for the next three months you will be
courted by both major parties. You will get a lot of attention and
hear a lot of promises.
   ``Mike Dukakis, Lloyd Bentsen and a united, committed Democratic
Party will stand shoulder to shoulder with you,'' Bentsen said. An
advance copy of his speech was released Friday in Washington.
   Bentsen told the group, which works to increase Hispanic
political participation, that its efforts already were being felt
with a big increase in Hispanic elected officials.
   The large number of Hispanic voters in Texas and California,
which ``together have 76 electoral votes _ almost 30 percent of the
total needed to win _ could tip the balance of power and elect our
next president,'' he said.
   Bentsen asked the group in both English and Spanish to support
the Democratic ticket this year.
   The stop in San Antonio was the first in a week of Texas
appearances designed to ``shore up the traditional Democratic
support in the state, and turn them into believers in the
Dukakis-Bentsen ticket,'' said Mike McCurry, the campaign's
spokesman.
   Dukakis planned to join his running mate at the end of the week.
   ``I think (the trip) underscores the high degree of importance
the ticket places on Texas,'' he said.
   Republican George Bush is a New England native who also claims
to be a Texan. But the Bentsen campaign will try to emphasize the
senator's deeper roots in the state. Bentsen was born in the Rio
Grande valley.
   ``He is clearly doing something George Bush cannot do ...
campaigning as the state's favorite son,'' McCurry said.
   By staying on the campaign trail, Bentsen also will be
constantly ready to respond to developments in New Orleans, the
site of the Republican convention.
   ``We know the Democratic ticket will be in for some sharp
attacks this week _ they might even say some things about Lloyd
Bentsen,'' McCurry said. ``We want to go back to our base and shore
it up while we are under attack.''
   After San Antonio, Bentsen planned to visit Kingsville, Laredo,
Brownsville and Houston this weekend. A quick trip to Arkansas was
scheduled for Monday and then it was back to Texas.
   Dukakis plans to join Bentsen late in the week for a visit to
the LBJ ranch and other events. Bentsen then will travel to Florida
next Saturday.

   A van carrying a children's softball
team veered out of control and into the path of a tractor-trailer
in a highway construction zone Friday, killing five children and
injuring 13, authorities said.
   The victims were members of a Midland Boys Club team returning
home after playing in a tournament in Abilene.
   The Boys Club van was carrying 14 children and three adults when
the accident happened on Interstate 20 in west Texas, said Mike
Cox, spokesman for the state Department of Public Safety.
   A club spokesman said the children are ages 10 to 12.
   Cox said the van collided with a Coca-Cola truck in a
construction zone one mile east of Sweetwater where traffic had
been narrowed to two lanes.
   Two witnesses, Mike Hanthorn and Bob Rogers of Attica, Ind.,
said the van was traveling behind the truck when the van's driver
appeared to lose control.
   The van ran off the road, veered back onto the highway and
underneath the truck, the witnesses said. The truck dragged the van
about 150 yards before the tractor-trailer jackknifed.
   ``The truck was sitting directly on top of the van. The van was
crushed ... very flat,'' said paramedic Glen Jones, who was at the
scene.
   The truck driver, Billy Tibbs, 32, of Abilene, was listed in
stable condition at Rolling Plains Hospital in Sweetwater with
internal injuries suffered when he was thrown through the
windshield of his rig. He was the truck's only occupant, officials
said.
   Four of the injured were flown by helicopter to two Lubbock
hospitals, and all were reported in critical condition, including
Damon Polk, 23, of Midland, identified as the driver of the van.
   Six others were in stable condition in an Abilene hospital. One
child was hospitalized in Sweetwater, and another was treated and
released.
   Jones said the injured suffered fractured limbs, injured backs
and internal injuries.
   Pete Goetz, regional director of safety for Coca-Cola, said the
truck was based in Abilene and was heading west with a full load to
make deliveries.
   Billie McNatt, education director at the Midland Boys Club, said
the team had left Midland at 6:30 a.m. Friday for a tournament in
Abilene, and was returning home when the accident occurred at 1
p.m. Abilene is about 150 east of Midland.
   Friday was the last day of the Boys Club's summer program and
the club was holding a party when word came of the accident, Ms.
McNatt said.
   ``We were in the midst of our party right when we were notified
of it. ... We just had to cancel our party,'' she said. ``It's
horrible. I just cannot believe it.''

<HEAD>Soviet Refusenik Family Arrives In Boston</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A refusenik family was embraced by tearful
relatives Friday evening as they arrived in Boston after gaining
permission to emigrate from the Soviet Union after the Moscow
summit.
   ``I'm overwhelmed with gratitude toward all the people who
helped me all the 11 years,'' said Yuri Zieman at Boston's Logan
International Airport.
   Zieman, his wife, Tatyana, and their 12-year-old daughter, Vera,
were greeted by relatives and Jewish activists who worked to secure
their exit visas.
   ``We'll drink champagne and I'll put them to bed, they didn't
sleep for two days,'' said Zieman's older daughter, Galina
Khatutsky, who emigrated in 1987 with her husband.
   ``I don't feel like it really happened because I was imagining
it so many times,'' said Mrs. Zieman. ``It's still in a dream.''
   U.S. diplomats said President Reagan had planned to visit the
Zieman family at their Moscow apartment during the summit meeting
to underscore U.S. concern for human rights in the Soviet Union.
   The visit was canceled after U.S. officials were warned it could
jeopardize the family's chances of emigrating.
   After the summit, the Ziemans were told their request had been
denied again, but a few weeks later they were granted permission to
leave.
   Zieman, 49, a computer specialist who lost his job when he
applied to emigrate in 1977, worked as a plumber until he became
ill several months ago.
   Zieman had been told he was not permitted to leave the country
for security reasons. He contended he never had access to state
secrets and had no information that could threaten Soviet security.
   The Ziemans left Moscow on Wednesday and stayed in Vienna until
they left for Boston. Khatutsky, of Boston, said her parents will
stay in an apartment in suburban Belmont.
   A refusenik is a term applied to Soviet citizens _ usually
Jewish _ who are refused permission to emigrate to another country.
   Among the gathering of about 30 people at Logan airport was
Sheila Galland of the Waltham, Mass.-based Action for Soviet Jewry.
She called the release of the Ziemans a victory for the refusenik
cause but said much work remains.
   ``There are still people waiting 10 years, 12 years,'' Galland
said. She called the decision to free the Ziemans, ``a P.R. ploy,''
for Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.

   House-passed legislation to withdraw all U.S.
investment from racially segregated South Africa and impose a
near-total trade embargo faces a possible Republican filibuster in
the Senate and a likely veto by President Reagan.
   The House adopted the disinvestment bill Thursday evening on a
244-132 vote.
   Supporters hailed the dramatic measure as a last-chance
opportunity to bring strong economic pressure to bear to help end
South Africa's apartheid system of racial separation by expanding
the less sweeping sanctions adopted in 1986.
   But Republicans said the bill represents a ``scorched earth''
policy that amounts to declaring economic war against South Africa,
a war they said would hurt the blacks it is designed to help by
causing millions to lose their jobs.

   Most doctors are not using clot-dissolving drugs
to treat heart attack victims, even though studies suggest such
treatment along with aspirin can dramatically reduce heart attack
deaths, say participants in the latest study.
   ``Our object is to get the results of this treatment widely
known so people will get this treatment,'' said Dr. Peter Sleight,
chairman of the new study's steering committee.
   On Thursday, Sleight and his colleagues reported that giving an
aspirin and a clot-dissolving drug within 24 hours of the onset of
a heart attack can reduce the death rate over the following five
weeks from 13 percent to 8 percent.
   This should now be considered standard treatment, the doctors
said. But ``at the moment, most patients in the United States don't
have blood-clot dissolving treatment of any type,'' said Richard
Peto, one of the researchers.

   A financial planner may have fled with as much as

other investors, each of whom received an apologetic note
explaining, ``I have run away.''
   Henry Gherman, 51, a former self-made millionaire whose career
as an ace salesman collapsed in personal bankruptcy, is believed to
have fled the Miami area, and sources close to the case say he may
have left the country.
   About 50 of Gherman's clients learned of his disappearance when
they received copies of the handwritten note in the mail this week.
   ``Everybody is pretty much in a state of shock,'' said Leonard
Filhaber, a 61-year-old salesman who says he had total trust in
Gherman for 12 years. ``We're all sort of walking around bouncing

   Sein Lwin resigned Friday after 17 days
as leader of Burma and the focus of a bloody popular uprising
against 26 years of repression, economic ruin and isolation imposed
by a socialist military regime.
   His government acknowledged 95 people were killed during a week
of violence in which soldiers regularly opened fire on unarmed
protesters, many of them high school students or Buddhist monks.
Diplomats in Rangoon say hundreds were killed and some estimates
surpass 1,000.
   Reports from Burma indicated security forces in at least two
towns had sided with the protesters, and a guerrilla leader waging
his own war against the government called for a coordinated
nationwide offensive to support them.

   Three U.S. technical experts involved in
monitoring Soviet nuclear blasts have been relieved of their duties
after the Soviets found them trying to make off with ``souvenirs''
from an atomic test site, administration spokesmen said Friday.
   The spokesmen, dismissing the episode as a ``misunderstanding,''
said the items found by Soviet authorities in creates being
prepared for shipment back home included a small hammer, a piece of
barbed wire, and several rock and core samples from a hole being
drilled at the site.
   The July 17 incident occurred near Semipalatinsk, in
south-central Russia. A U.S.-Soviet agreement allows each country
to observe and monitor each other's nuclear blasts. The U.S.
experts were at the site in advance of a planned explosion in
September.

   Wholesale prices rose at a brisk annual rate
of 5.7 percent in July despite smaller increases for food, the
government said Friday in a report that intensified already
deepening concerns about inflation.
   The Labor Department said its Producer Price Index, which tracks
prices for finished products one step before the retail level, rose
0.5 percent last month, compared with a 0.4 percent increase in
June.
   But what alarmed analysts most about the July report was that,
unlike previous months, the biggest increases were not in the
normally highly volatile food and energy sectors but across a wide
spectrum of consumer and capital goods.

   But their positions are disputed by ex-generals aligned with the

that a smaller Israel is a more vulnerable Israel.

   Virus-killing blood cells vary widely from person
to person in the way they recognize the AIDS virus and easily lose
their memory for the microbe, making an AIDS vaccine very difficult
if not impossible, according to new research.
   Early attempts at making AIDS vaccines have failed to prompt
blood cells known as B cells to make antibodies that wipe out the
virus. Some experts contend that for a vaccine to work, it must
activate the other main branch of the body's immune defenses, the T
cells.
   However, the latest research suggests important obstacles to
building a vaccine that rallies T cells to give life-long
protection against the many strains of human immunodeficiency
virus, which causes AIDS.

   Intravenous drug abusers changed their practices
after community workers started warning about AIDS, but even users
in treatment have immune system troubles that may hinder their

   Researchers also confirmed known links between psychological
states and immune system functioning, and suggested it may make a
difference with AIDS.
   The work was presented Friday at the annual meeting of the
American Psychological Association.
   The change in drug practices is significant because drug users
are often thought not responsive to health warnings, said
researcher John Watters.
   His study, done in San Francisco, found users cut back on
sharing of hypodermic needles, which can spread the AIDS virus, and
cleaned their needles more, as well as increasing their use of
condoms for sex.

   Mississippi legislators worked Friday to

the House and Senate were not in agreement.
   The federal investigation into corrupt county purchasing
practices has resulted in charges ranging from extortion to mail

pleaded guilty, six have been convicted, one has been acquitted,
one died before going to trial, one died after sentencing, and
another was declared mentally incompetent to stand trial. The
remaining ones still have charges pending.
   The state Senate prepared Friday to consider its version of a
county government reorganization bill, approval of which would

   Hunters flocked to the heather-covered moors of
Scotland and northern England on Friday, ``The Glorious Twelfth of
August'' and the start of the grouse-hunting season popular with
landed gentry and wealthy tourists.
   But the hunters' gunfire was muted by declining stocks of the
wild red grouse, due to a parasite and vigorous protesters who
drove the birds away with a pre-dawn swoop on three grouse moors.
   The Hunt Saboteurs Association, which opposes blood sports, said
about 300 members beat the hunters to the bushes and rousted the
grouse at Stanhope and Gunnerside Moors in northern England and in
an area near Muirshell Country Park in Scotland.

<HEAD>U.S. Soldiers Help German Farmers Harvest Crops</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ISOLDE HAUG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HEILBRONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When it is harvest time in West
Germany, some American soldiers switch from jeeps and tanks to
harvesters and threshers.
   This summer, about 80 soldiers stationed in southern Germany are
helping local farmers bring in their crops.
   Young soldiers like Pfc. David Connelly, 20, of Annandale,
Minn., are participating in a U.S. Army program to work a week or
two on nearby farms.
   Like his colleagues, Connelly volunteered for the work, which is
counted as a temporary duty assignment and not furlough time, but
to the GIs it's like a vacation.
   ``To me, working on the land is fun,'' Connelly said. ``Apart
from that, I can sleep longer here than I can at the barracks.''
   Suzanne Schmidt, a U.S. Army public affairs spokeswoman in
Heilbronn, said the program started about 10 to 15 years ago, with
the intent to build better relations between the U.S. military and
local people.
   ``It has been a really successful program, with interest growing
both on the part of the local farmers and among the young
recruits,'' Schmidt said in a telephone interview.
   ``Each year the program, which runs from the beginning of August
to the end of October, draws an increasing number of young
enlistees, many of whom come from big cities in the United States
and have never had a farm experience.''
   U.S. military officials see the project as a way of improving
relations between the 250,000 U.S. military personnel in West
Germany and the local population.
   These relations can be strained at times. Most recently, many
West Germans have been complaining about low-level training flights
by U.S. military jets.
   The stationing of U.S. intermediate-range nuclear missiles as
part of NATO's defense force in West Germany set off frequent,
sometimes violent demonstrations outside U.S. military bases in the
early 1980s. These tensions have diminished, however, with the
signing in December of the U.S.-Soviet treaty that will remove the
missiles.
   The U.S. Army 7th Corps in Heilbronn works with local farmers'
associations to publicize the harvesting program and to find places
among the local family farms for the soldiers.
   Schmidt said the soldiers are not required to have previous farm
experience, so long as they are motivated and eager to try.
   For the German farmers, the additional hands come inexpensively.
They need only provide room and board. The U.S. military pays the
rest.
   To farmers like Ludwig Waldburg, who is Connelly's German host,
the extra help is welcome.
   ``My family and I live and work the entire year just for and
from the harvest. Since our farm does not carry livestock, we earn
our income only from the grain harvest,'' Waldburg said.
   As they steer cropping and threshing machines through the dusty
wheat and corn fields, the American soldiers need little knowledge
of the German language to harvest the grains.
   Connelly, however, had no language difficulties since his host
family speaks English.
   He is also accustomed to farmwork, having helped out on his
uncle's 6,000-acre farm in Minnesota.
   Waldburg praised Connelly's efforts.
   ``He is not only ambitious, he also understands something of his
work.''
   Both spokeswoman Schmidt and farmer Waldburg agree that the
program's success has helped foster good relations between military
and community.
   ``Many times the host family and the soldier will call up and
ask for an extension,'' Schmidt said.
   ``A bond is formed, and often the soldier will go back to visit
the family at Christmas and Easter.''
   Waldburg, who was himself an exchange student in the United
States in his youth, also is positive about the program.
   ``I have only had the best experiences with the American
soldiers in the past years,'' he said.
   ``It is with programs like this that real friendship is built.''

   It's been nearly 80 years since the House of Lords
stuck one foot in the grave and its enemies began looking ahead to
a full burial.
   Yet this curious collection of princes, bishops, dukes,
marquises, earls, viscounts and barons seems to be staging a
miraculous deathbed recovery.
   Not only has the upper house beaten its elected partner, the
House of Commons, in the race to be televised, it also is handing
legislative defeats to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at more
than double the rate sustained by any Conservative government since
World War II.
   Those who despair of thwarting Mrs. Thatcher's radical
capitalist reforms in the Commons look increasingly to the Lords,
where most seats pass from father to son. The peers, who are not
elected and serve for life, can vote against the government with no
fear of party discipline.
   The Lords, top-heavy with conservative landowners, ought to be
the natural ally of Mrs. Thatcher's Conservatives. Yet it is the
opposition Labor Party, sworn enemy of inherited privilege, that is
benefitting most from the Lords' independence of mind.
   Mrs. Thatcher's 101-seat majority in the 650-member Commons
guarantees that bills pass in the lower chamber. But in the Lords
she has suffered 127 defeats since coming to office in 1979.
   In recent years the peers have opposed the abolition of London's
left-wing local government, rescued free eye and dental checkups,
restored free school transport in rural areas, stopped corporal
punishment in state schools, toned down a bill to abolish
university tenure, curbed the expansion of police stop-and-search
powers.
   The Commons still has the last word, and some measures,
including abolition of the London authority, ultimately become law
despite the Lords' resistance, but almost always with compromise
amendments.
   ``By and large the two houses have learned to live with each
other and the broad effect is that a lot of amendments made by the
House of Lords get accepted by the House of Commons,'' says Lord
Belstead, the Lords' Conservative leader.
   Lords-watchers now are divided into two camps: those who say a
house based on inherited privilege is bad, and those who say it's
bad but ...
   Hugo Young, a columnist in the left-leaning Guardian newspaper,
says the House of Lords relieves pressure for Britain to have an
elected upper chamber, like the U.S. Senate.
   ``It is proof that of all the democracies, Britain is the most
backward,'' argues Young.
   Lord Ponsonby, the Labor Party's chief whip, calls the
hereditary principle ``an intolerable affront to democracy.''
   But Ponsonby, himself a peer by inheritance, values the Lords as
a revising chamber where Commons' legislation is fine-tuned, and he
acknowledges that the Lords today is ``the best ally of the Labor
Party in the legislative process.''
   Although the House of Lords lost the right to make tax laws in
the 17th century, only in 1910 was it stripped of all power over
money bills and limited to two years the time period in which it
could delay a bill.
   The emasculation followed the Lords' veto of David LLoyd
George's liberal ``budget for the people,'' and most assumed that
the Lords, having thrown their reactionary weight about once too
often, would soon be scrapped altogether. Their power to delay a
bill was cut to one year in 1949.
   The creation of new peers remains a potent tool of government
patronage.
   Belstead maintains the Lords has opened up to new walks of life
_ actors, small businessmen, trade unionists, and women.
   But of the 1,191 peers, 759 are there by inheritance, only 10 of
them Laborites. All but four are white, all but 66 are men, and 446
are Conservatives to Labor's 117 and the centrist parties' 87. The
remainder are independents or declare no political affiliation.
   Only about 300 peers attend debates regularly, and in May the
government had to summon non-attenders to ensure passage of a
controversial property tax bill. The turnout of 509 was the second
biggest this century.
   The key to Mrs. Thatcher's defeats have been regular attenders
among the 266 independents, the ``crossbenchers.''
   Belstead, 55, a lanky former schoolteacher who inherited his
father's title in 1958, has no ready answer to why the House
survives.
   In an interview, he focused on the Lords' function as a revising
chamber, noting that peers work long hours and draw only 52-pounds
($88) for each session attended, plus expenses.
   The chamber also provides the Law Lords, nine ennobled judges
who sit as the country's highest court.
   Although they treasure their archaic rituals, the Lords boast of
an openness to change. They brought in electric lights before the
Commons, and have allowed their debates to be televised since 1984,
something the Commons only now is planning.
   All in all, it's a relaxed place. It's still quite acceptable to
fall asleep in mid-speech _ the giveaway is often the ear trumpet
sliding out of the hand _ or to ramble on at length about
grouse-shooting, leaky army boots, and what to do if Mrs. Thatcher
is at the hairdresser's during a nuclear alert.
   And then there's the joy of dressing up in ermine gowns and
two-peaked hats to welcome a new member.
   ``For one day of the year I was even prettier than my wife,''
remarked Len Murray when he went from being general secretary of
the national labor federation, the Trades Union Congress, to being
Lord Murray of Epping Forest.

<HEAD>Networks Still Confident of Stemming Audience Erosion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the three major networks held their
annual show-and-tell for television critics here, the question of
the hour was what the writers' strike would do to the new fall
shows.
   The strike ended midway through the critics' convention, and the
networks are reassembling the 1988-89 television season.
   Underlying the immediate effects of the strike, however, was the
longer-term and, for the networks, more worrisome issue of audience
erosion.
   The strike's effects can only steepen the seemingly inexorable
slide in ratings and audience share for the networks. Fewer people
are watching the networks because they have more choices _ cable,
syndication and VCRs.
   Two weeks ago, the three-network share hit its lowest level, and
cable sees itself becoming a major player in the scramble to catch
the eye of the roving viewer.
   ``You ask me what's going to happen in the next 10 years? You
won't hear the word `cable' anymore. It'll be `television,''' said
Michael Fuchs, chairman and chief executive officer of Home Box
Office. ``They're not going to be able to distinguish between what
was cable and what was the big three.
   ``I'm not trying to climb up the back of the networks. I think
there's room for all of us,'' Fuchs said. ``But we just don't feel
minor league anymore, compared to the networks.''
   The network executives who spoke to the TV critics, while not
exactly putting on happy faces, at least put up a brave front.
David Poltrack, CBS vice president for marketing, used numbers to
argue that the networks are doing quite well, considering.
   ``We constantly hear that we are losing our audiences to the new
alternatives and that somehow we are at fault,'' said Poltrack.
``The fact is that in 1980, the average American household had five
viewing options. The three local network affiliates were three of
these five options. In other words, the network affiliates
represented 60 percent of the viewing options. The networks
commanded 86 percent of the viewing audience.
   ``Today,'' Poltrack went on, ``the average American household
has 20 viewing options. Three local network affiliates are still
only three of the now 20 options. In other words, the network
affiliates represent only 15 percent of the average household's
viewing options. Yet the networks still command 68 percent of share
of prime-time viewing on a full-year basis.
   ``I, for one, do not think we at the networks have to make
excuses for that performance.''
   Robert C. Wright, president of NBC, concedes the networks are
losing audience but says cable has had it easy so far because its
programming, some of it old network material, has been relatively
inexpensive.
   ``As soon as they (cable channels) try to step up to a major
increase in viewership, they're going to have enormous cost
pressures of their own. I think they're going to have a very, very
tough time,'' Wright said.
   ABC Entertainment President Brandon Stoddard said he was
confident that quality network programming would hold audiences.
   ``If you have a successful program or a bunch of successful
programs, you're going to do fine,'' said Stoddard. ``NBC has more
successful programs than we do, and they're doing fine. ... I
actually think the network programs are getting better, and as they
get better, they're going to maintain share.''
   Stoddard's counterpart at NBC, Brandon Tartikoff, sees a ``cloud
on our horizon'' at his own network _ future absence of ``The Cosby
Show.'' Bill Cosby has said he would not continue the No. 1-rated
series beyond this season. ``Cheers,'' another top-five show for
NBC, is also likely to leave the air in the next couple years.
   ``I think we made the best segue in the history of broadcasting
when `Hill Street Blues' was in its last season, along came `L.A.
Law,''' said Tartikoff.
   ``So our hope is that we will have Bill Cosby next year. Our
hope is that the `Cheers' people will want to go one more and that
the audience will want them to go one more.
   ``But the intent,'' Tartikoff said, ``is to be in a flurry of
development as soon as our doors open up tomorrow in the
development of key 8 o'clock comedies and 8 and 9 o'clock dramas,
because I think that is the necessary formula for NBC to keep this
dynasty going.''

campaign of fictional candidate Jack Tanner, played by Michael
Murphy. ``They're dedicated to continuing it. I think it's
terrific, and they would love public television as their venue,''
said Suzanne Weil, senior vice president of programming and
promotion for the Public Broadcasting Service. HBO declined to
continue the critically praised but low-rated series after the
Democratic Convention, used as a real-life backdrop for one of the
final episodes.

   Like others at the 1980 Republican
national convention, orchestra leader Manny Harmon was nervously
awaiting announcement of Ronald Reagan's choice for vice
presidential running mate.
   Rumors persisted that former President Gerald R. Ford would get
the nod.
   For journalists, that meant getting copy ready on the former
Michigan congressman. For political power brokers and analysts, it
meant consideration of the impact of a Reagan-Ford ticket.
   For Harmon, who once again this week serves as musical director
at the Republican Convention in New Orleans, it meant making sure
his musicians had sheet music ready for ``The Michigan Fight Song''
and ``You've Got to Be a Football Hero.''
   ``All of a sudden Bush came out of the woodwork and everyone got
caught short,'' Harmon recalled. ``I couldn't think of where Bush
was from. I knew it was a couple of places (Maine and Texas).
   ``Then someone remembered that Bush went to Yale,'' Harmon said.
   Ah, an Ivy Leaguer. Sheet music out, ladies and gentlemen, for
``Boola Boola.''
   Once again, Harmon, now 78, saved the musical day. ``We just got
lucky on that one,'' he said.
   Harmon is playing the vice presidential blues this year on the
downbeat of certain Republican presidential nominee George Bush.
Harmon, in a recent telephone interview from his office, said he
has identified at least 12 possible candidates from news accounts.
And everyone has to have a song.
   Harmon may have only minutes from learning the name to playing
an introductory tune for the nominee. He has a 700-song library to
choose from.
   ``We try to figure out beforehand where the candidates are
from,'' said Harmon. ``I know some of the different candidates from
playing for them at various functions, and I know certain tunes
they like. And there are a lot of tunes that still have fire to
them but aren't regional,'' he said.
   That's important, because sometimes the official state tune
isn't necessarily the one that a crowd recognizes, or likes.
   For the record, noted Harmon, the official state song of
California is ``I Love You, California,'' not ``California, Here I
Come.'' and for New York, it's ``The Great Big State of New York,''
not ``East Side, West Side.''
   And folks are sensitive about that type of thing, Harmon has
learned. ``I once got called out on the carpet for playing `East
Side, West Side' for New York,'' he said.
   His compromise in such cases is a two-song medley, with the less
popular but official tune giving way to the more well-known number.
   Harmon also has noted over the years a shift in the role of the
orchestra at the convention. The orchestra once was used as a
device to bring unruly crowds under control with the irresistible
beat of a patriotic tune.
   Modern conventions, slickly produced and geared for television,
have fewer and fewer items settled by floor fights. They depend
more upon great sound, spectacles and split-second timing, he said.
   What's lost is the drama.
   ``Once in 1968 in Kansas City, there was a floor fight,'' said
Harmon, who could not recall what the fight was over. ``Then it
turned into a real demonstration, and things started to get out of
hand, (California Senator) George Murphy said, `Play something
patriotic!'
   ``We played `God Bless America,' and everybody had to stand
up,'' Harmon said. ``But we had to play it three times before
everybody calmed down.''
   Harmon is a Philadelphia native who has spent more than 50 years
in the music business, including 17 with RKO Studios, where he
scored and directed music for feature films. He also befriended
Murphy, then a song-and-dance man for the studio.
   As the leader of the Cocoanut Grove Orchestra in Los Angeles,
Harmon became a favorite of Hollywood stars and worked on several
films. He also became one of the movie colony's most sought-after
orchestra leaders for benefits and galas.
   Harmon's first gig as GOP bandmaster was in 1956, when Dwight
Eisenhower carried the party's banner for a second term, along with
Vice President Richard Nixon. A 50-piece orchestra played at that
Cow Palace convention in San Francisco.
   Harmon will bring 12 musicians to New Orleans and pick 10 more
union musicans from that city's ample roster. ``Everybody's on a
budget now,'' he said with a laugh.
   Harmon, who has also directed orchestras at several Democratic
Party functions, has declined over the years to reveal his
political affiliation. He has played music at various functions for
every American president since Franklin Roosevelt.
   Nixon liked foxtrots, he recalled. ``He and Mrs. Nixon used to
throw a lot of parties,'' said Harmon. ``They were always formal.''

<BYLINE>Safer or Saner? _ New York 25 Years After Last Execution
   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It seems an anomaly: New York state, populous,
powerful and, by virtue of its New York City appendage, also owner
of notably high murder statistics, is among only 13 states that
eschew capital punishment. Beginning in January 1977, when Gary
Gilmore was killed by a Utah firing squad, 12 states have executed
99 men and one woman. Up to 2,100 people are waiting on death rows
across the country. But New York state has no death row and
executed its last convict 25 years ago.

   For New York state, the execution of Eddie
Lee Mays in Sing Sing's electric chair on Aug. 15, 1963, was the
695th and last time it used the device of death it introduced to
the world in 1890.
   Yet in the quarter century since, debate about the death penalty
and its usefulness or offensiveness has no more faded than the
state's murder rate, now well above the national average.
   Is life more precious in places where governments refuse to
execute murderers? Are the streets safer? Are governors right to
veto capital punishment legislation, ignoring what polls indicate
is overwhelming support for the death penalty in New York?
   In 25 years, the rituals still carried on elsewhere, concerning
the electric chair, the last meal, the prison chaplain soothing the
condemned, have been supplanted in New York with new rituals of
emotional debate in the Legislature and among citizens.
   As frustrations mount on all sides of the issue, so do the
murder statistics. New York's criminals have not left the business
of killing even while the state has.
   The state's murder rate is nearly three times higher now than on
the day the 34-year-old Mays paid with his life for killing a woman
in a Harlem bar robbery. Below the national average in 1963, the
state's murder rate in 1987 stood at 11.3 per 100,000 people,
compared to 8.3 murders per 100,000 nationally.
   ``Those who favored abolishing the death penalty said society
would be more civil and we'd have about the same number of killings
but less crime generally,'' said Republican Dale Volker, a former
police officer from suburban Buffalo and the state senate's
strongest capital punishment advocate.
   ``Eventually, they said, we'd have a more moralistic system.
Well, clearly, the total and complete reversal has happened. We've
never had such viciousness as we have today. You have a situation
today where our streets are more of a war zone than at any time in
history.''
   The chief question in any debate about the death penalty is
whether it makes criminals think twice before committing capital
offenses. It is also the question no one can answer with enough
certainty to settle the issue.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo, a Democrat who has vetoed death penalty bills
in each of his six years in office, says the sentence has become a
sort of cure-all for many of society's ``terrible, terrible
problems.''
   ``Just keep saying `death penalty,''' he said of some advocates.
``Get them mesmerized with language. Hypnotize everybody. Just keep
looking at the electric chair.''
   Cuomo says there is no proof the threat of that chair deters
would-be murderers; he suspects it could make some criminals more
vicious. He also argues that too many people were wrongly convicted
of capital crimes to feel confident in sending prisoners to their
deaths.
   That uncertainty prompted the Legislature and former Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller to abandon the death penalty in 1965, except in cases
involving the murder of peace officers and prison guards.
   Later decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court and the state's
highest court, the Court of Appeals, effectively wiped capital
punishment statutes off the state books, and they was not restored
after the 1976 Supreme Court ruling that allowed states to resume
putting murderers to death.
   The way to lower the state's murder and crime rates is to
provide better education and health programs, including efforts
against drug and alcohol abuse, especially for poor young people,
Cuomo says. To control criminals, he adds, law agencies must be
well-funded and enough prison cells must exist to accommodate all
offenders.
   ``Cost you a fortune,'' the governor conceded.
   The Cuomo administration's criminal justice services
coordinator, John Poklemba, said the death penalty would not
``affect the vast majority of violent crimes that we need to do
something about.''
   ``The emergence of crack and the increase in the amount of drugs
that are now on the street, the enormous amount of cocaine that is
on the streets, is overwhelming the whole criminal justice
system,'' Poklemba said.
   The topic of crack-dealing desperadoes is a good example of how
vexing the debate can be. Volker and other death penalty supporters
say re-establishing the punishment is just the message society must
send. But Poklemba said the prospect of the electric chair means
little to such criminals.
   ``They have Uzi machine guns,'' he said. ``They're fighting it
out among themselves (for drug-selling territory). They certainly
don't care about a death penalty. The threat of being found guilty
and being executed 10 to 15 years down the road is not going to be
a deterrent if ... taking a chance of getting blown away that day
doesn't deter him.''
   Aides to Volker say that under a bill that's repeatedly been
before the Legislature, the perpetrators of about one quarter of
New York state's 2,000 murders a year could be charged with capital
murder and sentenced to the electric chair.
   But the measure won't become law this year. While the Senate
voted to override Cuomo's veto, the Assembly last month fell seven
votes short of the 100 needed.
   While most New Yorkers seem to have an opinion about the death
penalty, they apparently don't feel strongly enough to make it the
determining factor in who holds the state's highest office. Cuomo
and Gov. Hugh Carey before him both won election against
pro-capital punishment foes.
   ``Cuomo and Carey are important for the proposition that
political leaders who make it quite clear that they will not have
the death penalty because they don't propose to be responsible for
official homicides'' can still get elected, said Henry Schwarzchild
of the American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes the death
penalty. ``While the public disagrees, it will also respect that.''
   Cuomo is sure to be standing in the way again in 1989 and for as
long as he's governor. But Volker says death penalty supporters
will keep up their end of the ritual, too.
   ``I am convinced we will eventually override,'' he said.

   In a cramped gondola dangling beneath
an 11-story helium balloon, with clouds obstructing any view below,
the disembodied voice of the radar operator seemed scarcely to be
believed.
   ``You have crossed the coast of Ireland,'' the voice told three
American balloonists on that still-dark early morning 10 years ago.
Larry Newman asked if the message was indeed that which had eluded
others for 105 years.
   Silence.
   Then, crisply, ``Sir, my radar is never wrong.''
   Newman, along with Ben Abruzzo and Maxie Anderson, whooped with
joy. Sunburned and weary after five days aloft, the
businessmen-adventurers had made the first trans-Atlantic crossing
in a balloon.
   The three landed their black-and-silver Double Eagle II later
that day, Aug. 17, 1978, in a wheat field west of Paris.
   Today, Newman is the only one of the three still alive.
   Anderson was killed in 1983 at age 48 when his balloon crashed
in a West German forest during a race. Abruzzo, then 53, died in
1985 when his twin-engine airplane crashed shortly after takeoff in
Albuquerque.
   Newman, now 40 and a commercial airline pilot in Phoenix, Ariz.,
said he has no specific plans to celebrate Wednesday's anniversary.
   But he said his thoughts often drifted back to that summer 10
years ago.
   Newman recalled that after the initial jubilation, Anderson went
to sleep while he and Abruzzo looked down through the clearing
clouds on the lights of Dublin, Ireland.
   The silent 112-foot balloon 15,000 feet up caught sounds that
drifted skyward. Newman and Abruzzo could hear dogs barking and
trains rumbling along tracks nearly 3 miles below.
   ``Tears came to my eyes,'' Newman said. ``I put my arm around
Ben _ he'd always been somewhat like a father to me. I hadn't felt
that close to another human being for as long as I can remember.''
   The men began the flight six days earlier when the Double Eagle
II lifted up from Presque Isle, Maine, and headed toward Europe
more than 3,000 miles away.
   Newman says the flight was not without problems, including a
clash of personalities.
   ``Maxie Anderson later stated that he wished he could have flown
the flight by himself,'' Newman said. ``I don't know what Ben's
feelings were, but I wanted someone to share this with. I didn't
want to be Charles Lindbergh.''
   Newman said conflicts arose when Anderson and Abruzzo both began
making key decisions.
   ``Any aircraft can only have one captain, and we had two: Ben
Abruzzo and Maxie Anderson,'' he said.
   But Newman said conflicts were overshadowed by the hardships of
the flight in the 12-by-6-foot living space crowded with TV cameras
and navigational equipment. Newman's hang glider dangled beneath
the gondola and 5,500 pounds of sand and lead for ballast hung over
the sides in bags.
   ``There were many times the flight was in question,'' Newman
recalled. ``But how close it came to failure at each moment was
interpreted different by each of us.''
   They lost altitude rapidly at one point when ice chunks crusted
the top of the balloon. They jettisoned valuable ballast. When they
dropped to 4,000 feet the ice melted.
   Later in the flight they dumped more ballast, including an
expensive navigation system that had failed on the second day. They
tossed oxygen bottles, anything they could.
   Newman said that at one point, a bit delirious from the
altitude, he chucked a $4,000 radio _ and only later noticed a jar
of peanut butter that weighed as much.
   Plans were for Newman to fly the glider down once they made it
to Paris.
   But 400 miles from Ireland, it came down to a choice of dropping
the glider, their last oxygen and food, or a propane tank for a
heater to battle Abruzzo's frostbite. The glider went.
   Radios also failed during the flight, and the men had to
communicate by ham radio.
   ``The first guy I talked to wouldn't talk because I didn't have
a license,'' said Newman. ``And he didn't believe I was in a
balloon over the middle of the ocean.''
   Finally, Newman reached an old man confined to a wheelchair in a
home for the elderly somewhere in England.
   ``His call sign was `G4JY.' I don't think I'll ever forget
that,'' he said. ``He talked to me until the last day of the
flight. He was like the Good Shepherd.''
   Newman said the rough times were offset by the excitement.
   A high point, he said, came over Ireland when a jumbo jet
relayed a message from the Smithsonian Institution. The museum had
asked to display the gondola and balloon in the National Air and
Space Museum that houses the Apollo 11 moonship, Lindbergh's Spirit
of St. Louis and the Wright brothers' plane.
   In the final few hours the men believed they would make it to
Paris, where Lindbergh had landed 51 years before after the first
solo trans-Atlantic airplane flight. But over Evreux, France, they
realized they could not go on.
   The last of the ballast was gone, save for a bottle of
champagne. They were 60 miles west of Paris, 3,107 miles and 137
hours from Maine where the helium-packed balloon had taken off.
   The swiftly draining balloon envelope carcass and its gondola
settled gently to Earth as cheering spectators abandoned their cars
along a nearby highway and rushed to the balloon.
   Hundreds tried to take a piece of history.
   ``It's hard to chew rubberized cloth,'' Newman said. ``People
were trying to tear little shreds off, but I think they were
probably losing their teeth more than damaging the balloon.''
   The French press dubbed them the ``new Lindberghs.''
   But Newman says the only time he thought about Lindbergh was
when the adventurers drew straws that evening to see which would
sleep in Lindbergh's bed at the American ambassador's residence in
France.
   Newman and his wife won.
   ``And I ended up on the floor after 30 minutes because I
couldn't sleep,'' he said. ``The bed was like a banana. The springs
were shot.''

   Major U.S. banks have boosted the prime lending
rate back into the double digits for the first time in three years,
reflecting the Federal Reserve's drive to push all interest rates
higher to stave off inflation.
   Thursday's half-percentage point hike in the prime, to 10
percent, pushed the lending rate to its highest level since the
spring of 1985.
   The increase is likely to pinch the pocketbooks of consumers who
already have seen borrowing costs rise in recent months.

   Retail sales climbed 0.5 percent in July, the

but economists say rising interest rates threaten to dampen even
this modest growth rate in the months ahead.
   The Commerce Department said Thursday that sales increased $632

   Home prices and sales during the April-June
period portray a booming economy on the West Coast, some cooling in
the once red-hot Northeast, resurgence in the Midwest and a hint of
a turnaround in the Southwest, a trade group says.
   The National Association of Realtors said Thursday that three
California metropolitan areas posted the highest home appreciation
rates in the country.
   A 20.1 percent rise in prices from the second quarter of 1987 to
the same period this year made California's Anaheim-Santa Ana area
the costliest housing market in the nation. Median home prices
there were $204,000.

   A federal judge has upheld a landmark patent
ruling in favor of Polaroid Corp., saying another judge in the case
against Eastman Kodak Co. was unbiased even though a relative owned
Kodak stock.
   ``Under the circumstances, I cannot find that it is the law that
Eastman Kodak obtain a vacation of this case up to this point,''
U.S. District Judge David Mazzone said Thursday.
   Kodak had asked Mazzone to throw out a 1985 decision by another
federal judge that Kodak had violated several Polaroid patents on
instant film and cameras.

   The Treasury Department has auctioned 248-day
cash management bills at an average discount rate of 7.73 percent.
   The discount rate in Thursday's auction understates the actual
return to investors _ 8.19 percent with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,467.50.
   A total of $7.0 billion in bills with a minimum denomination of
$10,000 were sold out of bids totaling $25.7 billion.
   The bills will be repaid on April 20, 1989 and are being sold to
help smooth government revenue flows, which normally surge in April
as people pay their income taxes.

   Businesses and consumers with bank loans priced
according to swings in the prime interest rate will feel the most
immediate impact from major banks' decisions to boost the rate for
the third time this year.
   The banks raised their base lending rates by a half-percentage
point to 10 percent on Thursday _ a more than 3-year high _ in
reaction to the Federal Reserve's drive to push all interest rates
higher to curb inflation.
   The prime rate increase, the second in a month, puts the key
lending rate in double-digit territory for the first time since
June 1985.
   Because the prime is used to calculate a wide range of fixed-and
adjustable-rate loans, the change will affect consumers who already
have seen borrowing costs rise in recent months.
   A higher prime rate will affect small- to medium-sized
businesses and consumers more so than large corporations, which
borrow more cheaply in the open market by issuing commercial paper,
or short-term unsecured IOUs.
   Home equity lines of credit usually are pegged to the prime
rate, while many adjustable-rate home mortgages are tied to
interest paid on Treasury bills.
   Elizabeth G. Reiners, an economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.,
said higher borrowing costs may have a significant effect on the
spending habits of consumers, who have been buying on credit in
increasing numbers lately.
   ``If you have to pay more (for loans) then you have less money
to buy things like furniture, clothing ... and other little
niceties,'' she said.
   ``It will slow the economy, but it won't stop it in its
tracks,'' said Robert A. Brusca, chief financial economist for the
investment firm Nikko Securities Co. International. ``That's a
healthy thing right now.
   ``You try to get your flu shot before you get the flu ... That's
preventative medicine. That's what the Fed is doing,'' Brusca said.
   Financial markets took Thursday's news in stride after
weathering the storm that followed the Fed's increase in a key
lending rate earlier in the week.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed
up 5.16 to 2,039.30. Bond prices, which generally decline in the
face of rising interest rates, ended mixed.
   The dollar lost ground against all key foreign currencies,
although some European traders credited the prime rate hike for
preventing a free fall.
   Chase Manhattan Bank was the first to announce the prime hike
Thursday morning, with other major banks across the country quickly
following suit.
   The increase brings the prime to its highest level since June
18, 1985, when it was lowered to 9.5 percent from 10 percent.
   The prime was at 8.5 percent at the beginning of the year. The
banks raised it to 9 percent on May 11 and then to 9.5 percent on
July 14.
   Economists widely had anticipated the latest boost the Fed
signaled its desire to tighten credit on Tuesday by raising its
discount rate to 6.5 percent from 6 percent, citing inflationary
pressures. The discount rate is the interest the Fed charges on
loans to member banks.
   Economists said the subsequent boost in the prime reflected the
rising of borrowing costs faced by the banks. Rates banks pay on
products such as certificates of deposits or money market accounts
have been forced up, although not at the same pace as bank loans.
   The trend toward higher interest rates reflects prevailing
concerns in the credit markets that the economy might be
overheating and inflation creeping up. Higher inflation erodes the
value of fixed-rate investments such as Treasury bonds, forcing
borrowers to pay higher interest rates to attract investors.
   Many analysts predict interest rate will continue to head higher
but discount a big increase.

<HEAD>Bally Restructuring Continues With Plans to Spin Off Hotel-Casino
Group</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Bally Manufacturing Corp., which last month
disclosed the sale of its pinball-machine and video-game
businesses, is taking an even bigger restructuring step by spinning
off its hotel-casino group to its shareholders.
   Bally announced the planned restructuring late Thursday and said
it planned to maintain a 15 percent stake in the hotel-casino
business, which accounted for about half its $1.73 billion in sales
last year.
   The move is intended to boost Bally's stock price by creating
two separate companies and ``by permitting the separate management
of each company to pursue specific business opportunities on an
independent basis,'' Bally spokesman William Peltier said in a
statement.
   Bally's stock closed up 12{ cents at $22.75 Thursday in
composite New York Stock Exchange trading. The restructuring was
announced after the market closed.
   Bally's stockholders will receive as a tax-free dividend one
share of common stock in the hotel-casino business for each share
of Bally Manufacturing they own on the effective date of the
spin-off.
   The company, the creator of Pac-Man, Space Invaders, and other
video-game hits, announced last month it was selling its
pinball-video manufacturing business on which the company was
founded for about $8 million to rival WMS Industries Inc., parent
of Williams Electronics Games.
   Bally will retain all of its other leisure and manufacturing
businesses, which consist of Bally's Health & Tennis Corp., a chain
of 250 fitness centers; the Aladdin's Castle chain of more than 300
video arcades; the Scientific Games division, which manufactures
lottery equipment; Life Fitness Inc., a maker of exercise
equipment; and a slot-machine manufacturing division.
   The arrangement should allow the stock price of each
publicly-traded company to more accurately reflect Bally's
underlying value, the company said in a statement.
   Bally's health and fitness operations and the gaming equipment
divisions accounted for roughly 43 percent of the company's revenue
last year.
   Bally indicated it expected each of the separate companies to
post more than $1 billion in revenue this year.
   Lee Isgur, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New York, said
the company had been expected for some time to pursue some type of
restructuring.
   ``You could have the value of the two asset groups appreciate
significantly from where they are today,'' Isgur said. ``Diverse
groups of investors can focus on the group that most attracts
them.''
   Isgur said he began recommending Bally's stock last spring, when
it was trading around $16.
   Wall Street has regarded Bally as ripe for a restructuring due
to a relatively weak stock price stemming from an erratic
performance in several ventures, such as its video game business.
   Bally made big profits from the business during the video game
craze of the late 1970s and early 1980s, but earnings tumbled when
the games' popularity declined. Bally wrote off much of the video
game business in 1984 after it lost more than $100 million.
   Bally fended off a takeover overture from real estate developer
Donald Trump in 1987, paying a premium to buy Trump's 9.9 percent
stake in the company.
   The hotel-casino company will operate two Atlantic City casino
hotels, Bally's Park Place and Bally's Grand; and two casino hotels
in Nevada, Bally's Las Vegas and Bally's Reno.
   Consumation of the spin-off will require approval from New
Jersey and Nevada authorities and the Internal Revenue Service,
according to Bally, which also plans to seek stockholder approval.

<TEXT>
   Polaroid Corp.'s patent court victory over rival
Eastman Kodak Co. was upheld by a federal judge, who ruled that
another judge in the case was unbiased despite a relative's Kodak
stock holdings.
   U.S. District Judge A. David Mazzone on Thursday rejected
Kodak's request to throw out a 1985 decision by another federal
judge who found Kodak had violated several Polaroid patents on
instant film and cameras.
   Kodak attorney Richard E. Carlton immediately appealed the
decision to the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Mazzone's ruling came during the first hearing to set a schedule
for the damages portion of the case. Polaroid has requested $5.7
billion in damages for the patent infringements.
   The damages trial tentatively is set to begin in January.
   Kodak had argued in the 12-year-old patent case that all of
federal Judge Rya Zobel's rulings in the case should be vacated
because Zobel's mother-in-law owned 1,000 shares of Kodak stock
worth about $100,000 when the trial began in 1981.
   Zobel withdrew from the case in June shortly after her
mother-in-law died and she was named as a beneficiary of the stock,
which had increased to 2,150 shares because of stock splits.
   ``Under the circumstances, I cannot find that it is the law that
Eastman Kodak obtain a vacation of this case up to this point,''
Mazzone said. ``I do not think that would be fair or be equitable
to everyone.''
   Mazzone said Zobel made it clear at the outset of the trial in
October 1981 that her mother-in-law owned the Kodak stock. He said
neither Kodak nor Polaroid raised the issue during the initial
trial, after Zobel's ruling in 1985 or during a lengthy appeal
process.
   ``She said she did not think that was a disqualifying reason,''
Mazzone said, ``I don't think that was incorrect. Eastman Kodak did
not disagree with it.''
   Polaroid attorney Herbert Schwartz called the decision
``entirely proper and correct and obviously sound.''
   Polaroid, the Cambridge-based camera company that pioneered
instant photography, sued Kodak in 1976 after the Rochester, N.Y.,
camera company introduced its own line of instant film and cameras.
   Zobel ruled in September 1985 that Kodak had infringed on seven
of about 150 Polaroid patents, and barred Kodak from the business
in January 1986.
   On May 9, she told both sides that she intended to remove
herself from the case because she and her husband were
beneficiaries of her mother-in-law's estate. The judge acquiesced
after both sides encouraged her to continue in the case and asked
her for time to research the situation.
   But in a motion filed June 15, Kodak called for Zobel's
immediate disqualification and dismissal of all her rulings in the
case since October 1981. One week later, she withdrew.

<HEAD>Kansas City Southern Industries Federal Court Hearing Canceled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal court has canceled a scheduled
Friday hearing on Kansas City Southern Industries' application for
a stay of a recent court order barring its efforts to purchase the
Southern Pacific Railroad.
   KCSI president and chief executive Landon Rowland said he asked
the court to cancel the hearing on the advice of company attorneys,
who said it was ``procedurally not ripe'' to have the hearing now.
   He said the cancellation had nothing to do with Tuesday's
Interstate Commerce Commission approval of Rio Grande Industries
Inc.'s proposal to buy Southern Pacific.
   The ICC in a series of votes Tuesday rejected the Kansas City
Southern proposal, partly due to concern over Kansas City
Southern's financial outlook in light of a $600 million court
judgment against the company.
   In April, a U.S. District Court jury in South Dakota returned a
verdict that Kansas City Southern had violated antitrust laws by
helping block a coal slurry pipeline that would have taken some of
the railroad's business, and awarded the judgment to the state of
South Dakota.
   The verdict is being appealed to the 8th Circuit Court of
Appeals in St. Paul, Minn.
   A federal judge in Sioux Falls, S.D., recently ruled that KCSI
could not buy Southern Pacific Railroad while it is appealing the
judgment.
   ``We think its moot in view of the fact that the order has not
been entered in South Dakota,'' Rowland said of Friday's court
hearing.
   Southern Pacific, part of Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., has
15,000 miles of track and is one of the oldest rail lines in the
nation, with track stretching from Oregon to Louisiana.
   Sante Fe Southern reached agreement with Rio Grande Industries
on the sale last February, but when permission for the transaction
was sought from the ICC, Kansas City Southern objected and asked
that it be allowed to buy the railroad.
   Roland said the company's offer to buy Southern Pacific ``is
still on the table,'' and said the company would review all its
options when the full commission decision is released.

   The dollar fell today in early European trading
hampered by a European-wide outage of a computerized trading
system. Gold prices rose slightly.
   Foreign currency dealers said trading patterns were motivated by
profit-taking ahead of a holiday weekend in several European
countries. Selling pressure was increased by the computer outage,
they said.
   ``People are afraid they won't be able to get out of their
positions since trading goes only by phone and half our phone lines
here are already out of order,'' said one dealer at a major bank in
Frankfurt, West Germany.
   Dealers also said they were waiting for American trade figures
for June to be released on Tuesday. Analysts expect the trade
deficit to range between $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion, compared
with May's $11 billion deficit.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar finished the week at 133.05 yen, down 1.02 yen from
Thursday's close. Later, in London, it was quoted at 132.90 yen.
   Traders said the dollar opened lower in Tokyo and moved up
slightly after Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told reporters
exchange rates should be left to market forces. They said the
market interpreted his comments as an indication Japanese monetary
authorities are not planning to intervene or raise interest rates
to curb the dollar.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.8805 West German marks, down from 1.8995; 1.5710
Swiss francs, down from 1.5905; 6.3675 French francs, down from
6.4350; 2.1245 Dutch guilders, unchanged; 1,395.00 Italian lire,
down from 1,406.50; and 1.2215 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2231.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.7150, compared
with $1.7010 Thursday.
   London's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price
for gold this morning of $428.40 a troy ounce, up slightly from
late Thursday's bid $428. Trading was very quiet.
   In Zurich, the bid price for gold was $428.70, little changed
from $428.65 late Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 80 cents to close at a bid
$430.99.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.75 a troy
ounce, up from Thursday's $6.70.

winner Thursday, gained another 48.53 points or 0.17 percent to
close the day's trading at 27,833.51.
   ``Forecasts on U.S. trade figures due out next week have not
been very good and that's affecting the market, with participants
sitting back,'' said Hiromi Yoneyama, an analyst with Wako
Securities in Tokyo. Seasonal U.S. trade statistics are due out
next Tuesday.
   Volume of shares traded on the first section was estimated at a
light 500 million, down from 600 million shares Thursday and the
lowest full-day figure to date this year.
   ``It's a seasonal trend. Volume usually declines in August with
the baseball season under way and the `obon' holidays coming up,''
said Yoneyama. Many Japanese, including traders, take holidays
during the holiday starting Aug. 13.
   The U.S. currency finished the week's trading at 133.05 yen,
down 1.02 yen from Thursday's close. The dollar recovered slightly
from its lower 132.85-yen opening and fluctuated between 132.77 yen
and 133.30 yen during today's session.
   There will be no stock or currency dealings in Tokyo on
Saturday. The foreign currency trading is conducted on weekdays and
the Tokyo Stock Exchange is closed on the second and third
Saturdays of each month.

<HEAD>Investors Shocked By Financial Planner's Disappearance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WARREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A financial planner may have fled with as much as
$25 million in retirement funds belonging to a group of doctors and
other investors, each of whom received an apologetic note
explaining, ``I have run away.''
   Henry Gherman, 51, a former self-made millionaire whose career
as an ace salesman collapsed in personal bankruptcy, is believed to
have fled the Miami area, and sources close to the case say he may
have left the country.
   About 50 of Gherman's clients learned of his disappearance when
they received copies of the handwritten note in the mail this week.
   ``Everybody is pretty much in a state of shock,'' said Leonard
Filhaber, a 61-year-old salesman who says he had total trust in
Gherman for 12 years. ``We're all sort of walking around bouncing
off walls.
   ``My wife and I have worked 17 bloody years, morning, noon and
night, and now we're broke,'' Filhaber said Thursday. ``Now I can
understand why old people believe in mattresses.''
   In his note, Gherman said he was ``unable to face the
humiliation, disgrace and consequences'' that would follow once his
company, Financial & Investment Planning Inc., collapsed. He added
that he would try to return the doctors' money.
   ``I have been dealing with financial and emotional problems for
the past many months and have been unable to come up with any
solution other than running,'' the note said. ``By the time you
receive this letter, I will be gone. ... I have run away.''
   Gherman and his companies were being investigated for possible
wire fraud, bank fraud, embezzlement and interstate transportation
of stolen property, FBI spokesman Paul Miller said.
   Gherman handled pension funds for a long list of clients that
included at least 20 doctors, many of whom are wondering whether
they'll see their money again.
   ``I'm very angry,'' said Dr. Jack Lubin, a Miami Beach
pathologist. ``But I don't want to talk about it. I might say
something I shouldn't.''
   A court statement filed Wednesday by 12 clients who are suing
Gherman to recover the funds says the financial adviser fled town
Monday, leaving behind his wife and two grown children. Gherman
worked for some of the doctors for as long as 20 years, even
managing their offices.
   A Dade circuit judge on Wednesday granted the clients' request
to appoint a receiver to oversee the finances of Gherman, his
family and his companies.
   The investors also filed a $25 million lawsuit accusing Gherman
of fraudulently shifting their money to his wife and two children,
according to their attorney, Jay Solowsky.
   Gherman's wife said through an attorney that she had ``no prior
knowledge of his intentions to leave.''
   Solowsky said Gherman accepted money from clients to invest in
certificates of deposit, but banks said they had no record of any
CDs being purchased. Gherman also accepted money to buy medical
malpractice insurance for his physician clients but failed to pay
any premiums, Solowsky said.
   ``It's difficult to determine how much is missing,'' the lawyer
said. From polling various clients, Solowsky said he believes the
figure is as high as $25 million.
   Gherman is neither a lawyer nor an accountant, and his
investment and management companies are not registered with the
state as investment advisers, Solowsky said.
   Gherman, son of a New York City waiter, became a millionaire
before he turned 30 through his financial acumen and salesmanship.
He sold $1 million worth of insurance in one year for the John
Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co.
   His financial troubles began in July 1969. Gherman, then 34,
filed for personal bankruptcy, listing $1 million in unpaid bills
for casinos, hotels, credit card purchases, clothes and flowers.

<HEAD>Six Plead Innocent In Wall Street Racketeering Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five top officers of an investment group pleaded
innocent to racketeering charges alleging a scheme to sell bogus
stock and securities, and their lawyers criticized what they called
a ``broad attack on Wall Street.''
   A sixth defendant, a former trader for Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., did not attend the arraignment Thursday at federal court in
Manhattan, but his lawyer entered an innocent plea for him.
   The six were named last week in a 35-count indictment on charges
of racketeering and conspiracy, the first time racketeering charges
have been leveled against individual securities traders.
   In court Thursday, prosecutors disclosed that they plan to bring
a new and broader indictment in the case within two months. The
indictment could add additional charges or new defendants.
   The defendants from Princeton-Newport Partners, a limited
partnership based in Princeton, N.J., and Newport Beach, Calif.,
are James Sutton Regan, 46, of Pennington, N.J.; Jack Z.
Rabinowitz, 41, Charles M. Zarzecki, 40, and Paul Berkman, 41, all
of Princeton, N.J.; and Steven Barry Smotrich, 33, of Belle Meade,
N.J.
   Bruce Lee Newberg, 31, of Santa Monica, Calif., a former
securities trader at the investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., entered an innocent plea through his lawyer.
   Defense lawyers criticized the government's plan, saying it
would preclude a speedy trial because the lawyers would need more
time to prepare for any additional charges.
   The lawyers issued a three-page statement, which said in part
that the racketeering charges were brought ``to coerce the
testimony of the defendants against principals'' at Drexel and the
investment firm Goldman Sachs & Co., firms the partners had dealt
with.
   Two grand juries are investigating allegations of insider
trading involving the firms or their principals.
   The statement said the partnership ``is proud of its association
with those firms, has no evidence of any wrongdoing on their part,
and refuses to join in this broad attack on Wall Street.''
   Giuliani responded that the defense statement ``has no merit.''
He said federal prosecutors have used the racketeering statutes in
other securities cases and that defense lawyers in other cases have
always complained about it.
   The indictment accuses the six of a multimillion-dollar mail and
wire fraud conspiracy to make false stock trades in order to create
phony long-term capital gains and short-term capital losses for
Princeton-Newport.
   The indictment charged there was also a scheme involving the
bogus sale of securities between Princeton-Newport Partners and
Drexel to create more than $13 million in phony tax losses and
avoid regulatory disclosure requirements.
   If convicted on all counts, each of the defendants faces a
maximum 20-year sentence.

<HEAD>Judge Throws Out Proposed Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Audi of America Inc. says it's disappointed that
a judge rejected a proposed settlement to a class-action lawsuit
alleging that some of its cars were defective, and it may go to
trial with the case.
   Cook County Circuit Judge Thomas Rakowski on Thursday threw out
the proposed settlement between the company and a group of car
owners who alleged that their Audi 5000 sedans suddenly accelerated
without warning.
   The settlement ``puts people in a position where they have to
buy an Audi to reap any benefit,'' Rakowski said. ``Clearly, it's a
settlement that I couldn't live with.''
   Rakowski vacated an earlier order by another judge who gave
preliminary approval to the settlement.
   The judge recommended that both sides try to negotiate another
agreement and report any progress at a hearing Aug. 31.
   ``We are not sure that we will be negotiating,'' said Audi
spokesman Joseph Bennett. ``We always have the option of defending
the suit.''
   But he said that the automaker had not decided what option to
pursue.
   Attorneys for both sides announced the proposed settlement in
June, under which Audi would have offered rebates of $300 to $2,000
to 390,000 current or former owners who bought another Audi.
However, the company would not acknowledge liability.
   Circuit Judge Harold Siegan gave prelimary approval to the
settlement, but removed himself in July because of his friendship
with an attorney in the case.
   Attorney Stephen Nassau, who represents the Washington-based
Audi Victims Network, a group of Audi owners who contend their cars
had sudden acceleration problems, subsequently submitted a motion
to vacate Siegan's ruling. He contended the judge had failed to
give ``proper scrutiny'' to the matter before approving it.
   ``I certainly have a lot of respect for Judge Rakowksi,'' Nassau
said after the judge's ruling Thursday. ``He was obviously very
troubled by what went on so far,'' he said.
   The case stems from a 1987 class-action suit alleging the Audi
5000s were defective because they could accelerate without warning.
The settlement would have applied to owners of Audi 5000s built
between 1978 and 1986.
   The Center for Auto Safety, a Washington-based group formed by
consumer activist Ralph Nader, has contended that the Audi
acceleration problem was linked to at least 1,650 accidents,
causing 402 injuries and five deaths.

<HEAD>Record Broken For Bank Failures In Texas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The record for Texas bank failures in a
year has been shattered a little over halfway through 1988, the
legacy of a dramatic slump in oil prices and its reverberations
throughout the state's economy.
   Federal regulators declared three more Texas banks insolvent
Thursday, and their decision to count all 40 of First
RepublicBank's former subsidiary banks as failed institutions
produced a one-day total of 43 that raised the year's count to 86.
   The list of failed Texas banks soared far beyond last year's
total of 50 bank failures, the previous state record.
   Of the total of 141 banks nationwide listed by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. as having failed so far this year, more
than 60 percent have been in Texas. Four Texas banks have required
federal bailouts this year.
   The three banks declared insolvent Thursday were First Bank in
Balch Springs, Galena Park State Bank and West Houston National
Bank. First Bank and Galena Park will be merged with other Texas
banks, while West Houston National will not reopen but its
depositors will have access to their money at Texas Commerce Bank
of Houston, officials said.
   The FDIC was named receiver for liquidation in all three cases.
   Texas bank failures, like the nationwide figure, hit
post-Depression levels in 1986 and have increased since as the
state continues to feel the effects of the dramatic drop in oil
prices and its resulting effects on real estate and the overall
economy.
   Texas led the nation in bank failures the past two years, with
26 declared insolvent in 1986 and the 50 closed in 1987.
   Regulators frequently cite liberal lending practices and huge
loan losses as reasons for Texas bank failures and also blame
banking officials for poor management.
   Before the 1985 oil price free-fall, a risky loan could be made
and a bank could expect repayment from collateral if the loan
failed.
   But with the depreciation of real estate because of the drop in
energy prices, many loans cannot be repayed, requiring banks to set
aside more revenue to make up for the unpaid loans.
   Thursday's announcement could further provoke First RepublicBank
investors who have threatened legal action over the FDIC's move.
Many of the 40 subsidiary banks were healthy but were declared
insolvent by the government when First RepublicBank _ then the
state's largest bank holding company _ failed and was purchased
last month by NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., under an
FDIC-sponsored bailout.

<HEAD>Gould Sells Semiconductor Division to Micro Devices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gould Inc., which has been shedding divisions for
several years, has announced it is selling its Semiconductor
Division to California Micro Devices Corp. for about $70 million.
   In addition, the electronics firm announced Thursday it will lay
off about 40 people, or about 30 percent, because of the
Semiconductor sale and the previously announced divestiture of its
Industrial Automation Systems Group.
   The sale of Semiconductor, based in Pocatello, Idaho, is subject
to federal regulatory approval and is part of Gould's
debt-reduction and stock-repurchase program announced in May,
officials said. The sale is expected to go through within three
months.
   The Semiconductor Divison, which employs about 1,600 people at
Pocatello and at a packaging plant in the Philippines, had 1987
revenues of about $100 million.
   ``Gould's decision to divest the semiconductor business is based
on the company's strategy of focusing on those business areas that
offer the best opportunity for long-term growth in markets where it
is able to develop critical mass, and, at the same time, maximize
shareholder value,'' James F. McDonald, the company's chairman and
chief executive officer, said Thursday.
   Gould said the staff reductions at its headquarters would be
across all company functions. The company said it would provide
furloughed employees with severance pay and help find new jobs.
   After selling the Semiconductor subsidiary, Gould's revenues are
expected to be more than $650 million, down from 1987 revenue of
$933.4 million. Its total worldwide employment will be more than
6,500.
   The Semiconductor Division, known as American Microsystems Inc.
when it was acquired by Gould in 1982, makes custom integrated
circuits, among other products.
   Gould designs, develops and manufactures computers and
electronic products used in information processing, defense,
engineering and scientific applications.

   Sales of Roanoke County's sesquicentennial
coin are proving that good spelling isn't always good business _
collectors and the curious are seeking to obtain coins that
misspell the word ``beautiful'' as ``beautitul.''
   ``As far as we can tell, we're getting more calls since the
mistake was found,'' said Carolyn Wagner of the sesquicentennial
committee. ``I think people mainly are calling to get the coins
with the misspelling, but if they can't get those, they want the
correct ones.''
   Even some banks have called asking for the misspelled coins,
which are being sold in commemoration of the county's founding in
1838, Ms. Wagner said.
   A county employee discovered the blunder after 300 coins had
been sold.
   The misspelled ``beautiful'' was correct in a proof county
officials saw. A minter has acknowledged making the error.

   Share prices were higher at midday Friday, as
players cautiously stepped in to pick up some bargains after sharp
declines earlier in the week.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 8.3
points, or 0.5 percent, at 1,843.5 at about 12:15 p.m.
   The index moved up as much as 10.9 points in late morning.
   Volume was moderate at 244.3 million shares at midday compared
with 270.3 million shares at the same time Thursday.
   While gains were widespread, institutional buying focused on
selected shares. In particular, buying was seen in those stocks
that had suffered the most from the week's declines, triggered by
interest rate rises in the United States and Britain earlier in the
week.
   Fund managers, still sitting on large cash reserves, appeared
unwilling to miss out should equities begin to rally in coming
weeks.
   Many had expected the 100-share index to rise above 1,900 last
week, before interest rates were pushed higher.
   ``They (institutions) don't really want to be sellers,'' an
equity salesman said. ``There is a fear of having too much cash''
in institutional portfolios.

<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department's chief economist
said today that despite ``a massive loss'' in farm production
because of the drought, there is no danger of food shortages or
runaway inflation at grocery stores this year.
   ``We did come into this season with good stock levels,''
Assistant Agriculture Secretary Ewen M. Wilson said on the NBC-TV
``Today'' program. ``So there is no prospect of any shortages this
year and we don't think there will be big price increases because
we came in with pretty good supplies.''
   The USDA issued a report Thursday saying the drought should add
only 1 percentage point to consumer food prices.
   ``We don't see any runaway price inflation at the retail
level,'' Wilson said in the interview.
   The relatively optimistic price report came despite drought
damage that is expected to include a 37 percent drop in corn
production and continued threats to the soybean crop.
   ``These figures show a massive loss in production. It's almost
unprecedented what we're seeing this year. We had a very, very dry
period in June,'' he said. ``We're now moving into a critical phase
for the soybeans and if we don't get rain in August we'll lose even
more of the soybean crop.
   The department now is forecasting a food price increase for this
year of 3 percent to 5 percent. Before the heat and dry weather,
USDA had expected a 1988 food price hike of 2 percent to 4 percent.
   But the impact might be even bigger in 1989, when food costs
could go up an additional 2 percent due to the drought, Wilson told
reporters Thursday.
   ``That's on top of an additional estimated increase in food
prices somewhere in the region of 4 percent,'' Wilson said. ``So
this would bring it up to a total of 6 percent.''
   According to a USDA crop production report issued Thursday, the
corn harvest this fall may be about 4.48 billion bushels, down 37
percent from last year's harvest and the smallest output since 1983.
   Sharp reductions also were reported for soybeans, wheat and a
number of other crops. Cotton, which thrived last month in the hot,
humid weather, is expected to increase from last year.
   The grim news from USDA came only hours after President Reagan
signed a $3.9 billion disaster relief bill aimed at helping
drought-stricken farmers.
   ``This bill isn't as good as rain,'' Reagan said to the nation's
farmers. ``But it will tide you over until normal weather and your
own skills permit you to return to your accustomed role.''
   Overall, the department's Agricultural Statistics Board put
total U.S. crop production at 88 percent of the 1977 average, a
scale used to compare output from year to year. Tha matched the low
1983 reading, when sharp cutbacks in government acreage programs,
along with drought, reduced production sharply.
   The corn crop is expected to average 78.5 bushels per harvested
acre, down from 119.4 bushels per acre last year, a record
year-to-year decline of 34 percent.
   Corn is the largest and most important crop grown by American
farmers and, as a feed ingredient, is essential to the production
of meat, poultry and dairy products.
   ``Today's reports confirm that the drought has had a major
impact on this year's crops,'' Wilson told reporters. ``But because
of large pre-season stocks, total supplies are enough in most cases
to assure an adequate food supply at home, satisfy foreign
customers and meet our food-aid commitments.''
   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, said in a statement, ``Today's crop report confirms our
fears about the impacts of this summer's tragic drought.
Fortunately, it appears we will have enough stocks to make it
through this marketing year.''
   The new USDA crop estimates were based on field surveys as of
Aug. 1. In May and June, before drought had made its biggest
impact, USDA projected the corn harvest _ based on trends and an
assumption of normal weather _ at 7.3 billion bushels.
   But those projections were revised downward a month ago to 5.2
billion bushels, assuming farmers got normal weather the remainder
of the season.
   The soybean harvest was estimated at 1.47 billion bushels, down
23 percent from 1.9 billion bushels produced last year. Prospects
last spring called for about 1.88 billion bushels, and the July
projection was 1.65 billion bushels.
   Production of all wheat was indicated at 1.82 billion bushels,
down 13 percent from 2.1 billion produced in 1987.
   Winter wheat production was estimated at 1.55 billion bushels,
down 1 percent from last year. But durum and the other spring
varieties, which are produced in the hard-hit northern plains,
showed sharp declines.
   Durum was estimated at 54.6 million bushels, down 41 percent
from last year's harvest, and other spring wheat was shown at 212
million bushels, down 53 percent from 1987.
   Cotton production was estimated at 14.9 million bales, up 1
percent from last year. The crop was projected at 13.7 billion
bales in July.
   Production of some other spring-planted crops also has suffered,
including: oats, 206 million bushels, down 45 percent; barley, 288
million bushels, also down 45 percent; and sorghum, 561 million
bushels, down 24 percent.
   Earlier, at the White House, Reagan praised Democratic and
Republican congressional leaders for putting aside partisan
differences to speed action on the disaster relief bill.
   Reagan said the legislation, which also provides assistance to
dairy cattlemen and ethanol producers, ``represents the largest
disaster relief measure in history.''
   The measure, among other things, provides aid for farmers
suffering crop losses of more than 35 percent of their expected
harvest because of the drought or other calamities. The payments
would be equal to 65 percent of the lost income. Farmers whose crop
losses exceeded 75 percent of the expected yield would receive
payments equal to 90 percent of lost income.
   The Agriculture Department said farmers intending to apply for
relief under the drought bill should organize all their records and
other evidence of their crop losses. The department said, however,
that the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service would
not be ready to start accepting applications for several weeks.
   Once the preliminary rule-making for the program is completed,
farmers will apply to their ASCS county agent for both the disaster
payments and livestock feed assistance. Farmers seeking government
loans also available under the program should contact their local
Farmers Home Administration offices, USDA said.

<HEAD>Billions of Underground Rubles, Thousands of Millionaires</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A shadow economy that supplies everything the
official system can't, from bathroom repairs to medicine, earns up
to $145 billion a year and has made thousands of millionaires, a
report said today.
   Economist T.I. Koryagin told the labor newspaper Trud the
underground economy will continue to grow until rubles earned by
average people become more than ``paper that gives you the right to
stand in line and be humiliated.''
   Many Soviets gladly pay more on the side for scarce goods or to
have a repairman do better, faster work. They also give doctors a
gift or cash to be more attentive. Extra money, in turn, gives
those who earn it a chance to buy goods and services above
state-set prices.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's moves to legalize cooperatives and some
individual labor have brought some people out of the shadows and
into the official economy where they pay taxes. But many more
remain outside, corrupting the official system, the article said.
   Services provided on the side, or ``na levo,'' in Russian,
account for about $22 billion to $24 billion a year, or about
one-quarter of the entire amount Soviets pay annually, it said.
   The article said that 15 or 20 years ago, the value of
underground services was about $4.8 billion to $8 billion. Today,
together with the underground trade in food and other goods, it
ranges from $110 billion to $145 billion.
   By comparison, the entire Soviet state budget for this fiscal
year is about $760 billion.
   The main items are overpaying workers for better housing and car
repair, tailoring, and better attention at weddings and funerals,
it said.
   The shadow economy is well known, but figures are rarely given
for its size. Under Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' or openness
on selected topics, the Soviet media have been more critical of
social problems.
   Ms. Koryagin disagreed with some Soviets who see the underground
economy as merely instituting one of the main aims of Gorbachev's
reforms, paying more to people who work better.
   ``Underground businessmen pull into their affairs the
bureaucracy and the apparatus, which increases the growth of
corruption _ in order to live in the existing system it's necessary
to bribe people who don't do anything themselves but who have the
final `yes,' or `no,''' she was quoted as saying.
   The Soviet Union has a few hundred legal millionaires, mostly
writers and artists, but probably thousands more in the shadow
economy, the article said.
   ``There are among them people who don't have a ruble in cash.
Their money is constantly turning over in order to bring them an
income,'' she reported.
   The underground economy will continue to exist until the
official economy can provide the goods and services people want,
the article said.
   That means the economy must in the future be managed by the laws
of the market rather than bureaucrats, it said.
   ``That means we need directives that would return land to
farmers, and factories to the workers _ to make the people the
all-powerful masters of the country,'' Ms. Koryagin concluded.

<HEAD>Report Shows Inflation On The Rise</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with six grafs to UPDATE with report on wholesale
prices; will be led with Commerce Department report on business
inventories and sales during June, due at 10 a.m. EDT.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Inflation at the wholesale level rose to an annual rate of 5.7
percent in July, reflecting big boosts in a wide variety of
products, including clothng, automobiles, furniture and poultry,
the government said today.
   The Labor Department reported that wholesale prices rose 0.5
percent last month, the biggest gain since March. Price increases
were widespread across a wide variety of non-food items, such as
drugs, which were up 1.1 percent and cosmetics, up 1.7 percent.
   In June, the department's Producer Price Index for finised goods
rose 0.4 percent, or at an annual rate of 4.6 percent, more than
double the 2.2 percent rate of wholesale price inflation for all of
1987.
   Today's report comes just three days after the Federal Reserve
initiated an increase in interest rates to fight inflation.
   On Thursday, major U.S. banks reacted quickly to the Fed's move
by boosting the prime lending rate a half percentage point to 10
percent, the highest level since the spring of 1985.
   The prime rate hike, though, didn't upset the financial markets
because it was a widely expected response to the Fed's earlier
action, in which the central bank raised the discount rate half a
percentage point to 6.5 percent.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose
5.16 Thursday to 2,039.30. The average had had fallen nearly 100
points over the five previous sessions, partly because of
interest-rate jitters.
   The dollar lost ground against all key foreign currencies,
indicating that the boost in the prime rate was not seen as a
powerful lure for foreign money.
   The dollar's weakness in turn hurt bond prices, which finished
mostly unchanged or lower.
   Because the prime is used to calculate a wide range of fixed-and
adjustable-rate loans, the increase is likely to pinch the
pocketbooks of consumers who already have seen borrowing costs rise
in recent months.
   ``It will slow the economy, but it won't stop it in its
tracks,'' explained Robert A. Brusca, chief financial economist for
the investment firm Nikko Securities Co. International. ``That's a
healthy thing right now.
   ``You try to get your flu shot before you get the flu ... That's
preventative medicine. That's what the Fed is doing.''
   The increase brings the closely watched rate to its highest
level since June 18, 1985, when it was lowered to 9.5 percent from
10 percent.
   At the start of the year, the prime stood at 8.5 percent. It was
raised to 9 percent on May 11 and then another half percentage
point on July 14.
   The trend toward higher interest rates reflects prevailing
concerns in the credit markets that the economy might be
overheating and inflation creeping up.
   In indicator of economic activity, the Commerce Department
reported that retail sales climbed 0.5 percent in July. But
economists warned that rising interest rates threaten to dampen
even this modest growth rate in the months ahead.

<HEAD>Long Distance Company Reports Loss, CEO Resigns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president and chief executive
officer of ALC Communications Corp., the nation's fourth-largest
long-distance telephone company, has resigned after the company
reported a $6.6 million loss in the second quarter.
   Geore Vasilakos, who resigned Thursday, will be replaced by
Richard Irwin, a CTI director who was named ALC board chairman last
week, ALC said.
   ``With the recent change in control at the company, he wanted to
give the new board the opportunity to make some immediate
changes,'' the company said in announcing Vasilakos' resignation
Thursday.
   ALC had a net loss of $6.6 million on net revenue of $99.9
million for the quarter ending June 30, compared with a net profit
of $1.1 million on revenue of $99.9 million in the second quarter
of 1987.
   The company had a loss of $9.8 million on revenue of $201.6
million for the first six months of the year, compared with a
profit of $3.8 million on revenue of $205 million in the first half
of 1987.
   ALC said its long-distance traffic was up 17 percent in the
first six months of the year compared with a year earlier, but the
losses resulted from price cuts totaling 18 percent in the highly
competitive long-distance business.
   The company has had money problems since Allnet merged with
Lexitel in 1986 to form the nation's fourth-largest long-distance
network. It laid off 200 workers, including 40 in Michigan, in June
in an attempt to cut operating losses.
   ALC completed a $15-million stock sale Aug. 5 to Communications
Transmission Inc. of Austin, Texas, giving CTI two of five seats on
the ALC board.

   Stock prices lost more ground today as rising
interest rates kept the pressure on the market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 7.83 to 2,031.47
in the first half hour of trading.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
310 up, 546 down and 490 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 48.65 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   More than two-thirds of that activity was concentrated in a few
electric utility issues caught up in trading strategies keyed to
their approaching dividend payments.
   Otherwise, analysts said the market was weak and listless, still
struggling to recover its balance after the Federal Reserve's move
Tuesday to raise its discount rate.
   In the credit markets today, prices of long-term government
bonds fell by roughly $5 for each $1,000 in face value, putting
their yields in the 9.45-9.5 percent range.
   The report that the producer price index of finished goods rose
0.5 percent in July was in line with advance estimates. But
analysts said some traders were troubled by the 0.6 percent
increase in the index after the volatile food and energy components
were excluded.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines dropped ] to 118|; Coca-Cola lost \ to 37[, and American
Express was unchanged at 28.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.41 to 148.19. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .32 at 296.42.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 5.16 to
2,039.30.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 4 on the
NYSE, with 638 up, 811 down and 526 unchanged. Big Board volume
totaled 173 million shares, against 200.95 million in the previous

   National Semiconductor Corp. has been

   The order granted on Thursday bars the companies from using
proprietary information of National or Fairchild Semiconductor,
which Fairchild bought last year.

   First National of Omaha Inc. has reached an
agreement to buy the holding company of First National Bank of
Columbus, a transaction Omaha bank officials described as the
largest bank acquisition in the state's history.
   If federal regulators approve the deal, First National, holding
company of the First National Bank of Omaha, would pay about $22
million in cash for First National Columbus Bancorp., principal
owner of First National of Columbus, the companies said.
   The Omaha bank is the fourth largest in Nebraska. The Columbus
bank is the seventh largest.
   Bruce R. Lauritzen, president of the Omaha bank, said the deal
would add $210 million in assets to First National of Nebraska's
$1.35 billion in assets.
   He said money for the purchase would come from the holding
company's revenues and from borrowed funds.

   U.S. wood product sales to Pacific Rim
countries will reach $3 billion this year, up more than 15 percent
from 1987, according to a government report.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., has released details of the report,
which will be officially unveiled at a hearing he will hold Monday
in Portland.
   The report said most of the wood products sold to the Pacific
Rim countries were harvested and milled in the Pacific Northwest.
   Wyden said the report also indicates that Northwest forest
manufacturers are threatened by a series of trade barriers in these
countries, which will be the subject of Monday's hearing by Wyden's
Small Business Subcommittee on Regulation and Business
Opportunities.
   ``Strengthening foreign sales of Northest wood products has got
to be a top priority for our government,'' Wyden said in a
statement this week.
   ``We've knocked down some of the tariff barriers. But non-tariff
obstacles like arbitrary building code restrictions are just as
costly to our industry.''
   Witnesses at Monday's hearing will include Michael T. Kelley,
deputy assistant secretary of commerce for basic industries;
representatives of major timber products associations; Richard
Reiten, director of the Oregon State Economic Development
Department; and Frank Martin, general manager of the Port of Coos
Bay.

<HEAD>Casino Regulators Reject Stockholder Arguments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAWRENCE TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two stockholders of Resorts
International Inc. will have to go to civil court to try to block
Donald Trump from getting more than $60 million from his deal to
sell the company, following the rejection of their claims by the
Casino Control Commission.
   The panel said Thursday that the stockholders should take their
objections to a civil court. Julien J. Studley Inc. and Joseph
Gutstein had argued that Trump is not entitled to any payment for
severing his services agreement.
   In May, Trump reached an agreement to sell his interest in
Resorts to entertainer Merv Griffin in a deal which will take the
company private and give Trump the unfinished Taj Mahal casino
hotel.
   Griffin has agreed to buy Trump's controlling Class B stock in
the company for $96.2 million and to pay Trump approximately $63
million to sever a services agreement. The services agreement was
based on revenues, pre-tax income and the construction cost of the
Taj Mahal.
   In return, Trump agreed to buy the Taj Mahal for approximately
$255 million.
   The stockholders argued that Trump is not entitled to any
payment for severing his services agreement with Resorts, and the
agreement is void.
   Alan Bandler, a lawyer for the stockholders, has said Trump
bought control of the company a year ago and is now making a $63
million profit from the termination of the management agreement, as
well as getting the Taj Mahal at a lucrative price.
   In the interim, Bandler has charged, the stockholders have lost
$135 million and he cited the decline in market value of Resorts
Class A stock.
   The commission also ruled it would not consider the financing of
the Trump-Griffin deal until Griffin receives interim casino
authorization, for which he has applied.
   Under New Jersey law, interim casino authorization allows an
unlicensed company or individual to hold an interest in, or control
of, a casino company without first going through the extensive
licensing process.

<HEAD>European Airlines Say Flight Delays Growing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Association of European Airlines
said delays in scheduled European flights in June were at least
three times as many as in June 1986.
   AEA Secretary-General Karl-Heinz Neumeister said Friday that
while delays in scheduled flights are not yet as bad as for charter
flights, ``the situation is definitely getting worse.''
   In January, 11.5 percent of scheduled flights in Europe were
more than 15 minutes late and by late June, this had reached 22
percent, Neumeister said in a statement.
   ``In June 1988, the delays caused by congestion problems were
more than three times as many as in June 1986,'' he said.
   In reality, he said, the picture is even worse since AEA on-time
figures do not include ``reactionary delays'' where inbound
flights, late due to insufficient air traffic control capacity,
delay outgoing flights.
   Normally, flight punctuality drops during the winter months
because of weather conditions and rises in the summer.
   ``In 1988, the trend was reversed,'' Neumeister said. He blamed
this uncharacteristic drop on insufficient air traffic control
capacity.
   In recent months, thousands of European vacationers have spent
long hours at airports as their south-bound charters were delayed
by strikes by air traffic controllers in several countries.

   The announcement in U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Warren Bentz's

   The paintings depicting scenes from Sharon's plant in Farrell
have hung in Posner's Florida office for nearly 20 years.
   Cindrich said Posner does not have a 14th painting mentioned in
Toren's lawsuit. Russell Ober Jr., an attorney for the trustee,
said he will file a claim in court holding Posner responsible for
the 14th.
   None of the attorneys could estimate the value of the paintings,
for which Sharon Steel paid Rockwell $50,000. A single Rockwell
illustration for a light bulb manufacturer recently sold at auction

<TEXT>
   Corn, oat and soybean futures soared their
permitted limits at today's opening on the Chicago Board of Trade
in reaction to the Agriculture Department's assessment of the
drought's toll on crop production.
   In a report issued after the markets closed on Thursday, The
USDA predicted this year's U.S. corn production would fall 37
percent below last year's harvest, soybean production would decline
by 23 percent and wheat production would drop by 14 percent.
   Analysts said the government's soybean production estimate of
1.47 billion bushels _ the smallest harvest since 1976 _ was the
biggest surprise.
   ``The market must work higher to seek a price that will
discourage usage or we're simply going to run out of soybeans, and
the market won't let that happen,'' said Rich Feltes, director of
commodties research for Refco Inc., a Chicago-based commodity
brokerage house.
   Corn and oat futures are limited to daily moves of 10 cents a
bushel and soybeans to 30 cents a bushel. The exchange has removed
the limits on the soybean contract for August delivery, which
leaped more than 50 cents a bushel at the opening.
   In early trading, wheat was 9{ cents to 10 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.92 a bushel; corn was 5}
cents to 10 cents higher with September at $3.06{ a bushel; oats
were 10 cents higher across the board with September at $2.84{ a
bushel; and soybeans were 30 cents to 59 cents higher with August
at $9.15 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were higher in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .30 cent lower to .58 cent higher with August
at 68.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .37 cent to .60 cent
lower with August at 80.30 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to 1
cent higher with August at 46.80 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .68 cent to 1.93 cent higher with August at 36.40 cents a
pound.
   Cattle futures settled lower on Thursday while pork futures were
higher.

   Wholesale price inflation increased to an
annual rate of 5.7 percent in July, spurred by big boosts over a
wide variety of products, including clothing, automobiles,
furniture and poultry, the government said today.
   The increase came despite lower prices for beef, as the drought
prompted farmers to slaughter more animals because of burned-out
pastures and higher feed prices.
   Just three days after the Federal Reserve Board initiated an
increase in interest rates to fight inflation, the Labor Department
said wholesale prices rose 0.5 percent in July, the same monthly
increases as in May and March.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We would
rather not see any increase in producer prices, but we still
believe inflation remains low and under control.''
   In June, the department's Producer Price Index for finished
goods rose 0.4 percent, or at an annual rate of 4.6 percent, more
than double the 2.2 percent rate of wholesale price inflation for
all of 1987.
   Wholesale prices for consumer foods increased at a slower pace
in July _ 0.4 percent _ than for goods overall, indicating to some
analysts that the worst immediate effects of the drought plaguing
the farm belt were over. Food prices had been rising faster than
prices for other products on the wholesale level since April.
   Overall energy prices, meanwhile, remained unchanged after a 1.6
percent drop in June, with a 3 percent seasonally adjusted increase
in gasoline prices offsetting a 6.1 percent decline in what
distributors pay for home heating oil.
   Excluding food and energy, wholesale prices rose at 0.6 percent
in July. Because food and energy prices are highly volatile from
month to month, most analysts look to price changes for other
products as a better indication of underlying inflation.
   Analysts said the softer food prices partly offset what they
called an over-reaction in June to the drought.
   ``As expected, higher feed prices and burned-out pastures have
sharply increased market slaughters and begun to influence meat
prices,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting
at Georgia State University. In addition, Ratajczak said, fruit
trees under stress from the unusually hot weather are throwing off
their fruit early ``resulting in a temporary early supply of
fruit.''
   Wholesale prices in July fell 2.5 percent for beef, 10.5 percent
for pork and 0.2 percent for soft drinks. They rose 2.3 percent for
fruit, compared with a 6.7 percent increase in June, 7.5 percent
for vegetables, 13.3 percent for bakery products, 2 percent for
chickens and 20.3 percent for processed turkeys.
   Rataczak predicted that meat prices will rise sharply in 1989 as
a result of the early slaughters and fruit prices will spiral
upwards this fall because of less than the usual supply then.
   Price increases were widespread across a wide variety of
non-food items. Men's clothing rose 0.9 percent, drugs were up 1.1
percent, cosmetics increased 1.7 percent and auto prices edged up
0.5 percent after a 1 percent decrease in June.
   The only non-food, non-energy consumer items for which wholesale
prices fell last month were glassware, down 2.3 percent, and
household flatware, down 0.4 percent.
   The July increase in finished goods overall put the Labor
Department's index at 108.5. That means a variety of goods costing
$100 at the wholesale level in 1982 cost $108.50 last month,
compared with $107.90 in June and $106.00 a year ago.
   Wholesale prices for intermediate goods used in production rose
0.7 percent in July, indicating more inflation lies ahead despite
the Federal Reserve Board's decision Tuesday to boost the rate it
charges banks for credit from 6 percent to 6.5 percent.
   Prices for intermediate goods, or those used in processing, had
risen 0.9 percent in June. Analysts said the smaller July increase
was due almost entirely to a decline in oil prices before before
OPEC members Iran and Iraq agreed late in the monthy to a
cease-fire.
   Excluding food and energy, prices for intermediate goods such as
industrial chemicals, finished steel products, paper and synthetic
fibers rose 0.7 percent overall.
   However, raw material prices fell 1.1 percent, with crude oil
prices plummeting 9.3 percent. Corn prices soared 20 percent on the
drought, but the increase was smaller than in June. Raw iron and
steel prices jumpted 12 percent after holding fairly steady for
three months.
   Price changes on the retail level usually lag one to three
months behind those at wholesale. Consumer price inflation has been
averaging 4.4 percent for the past 18 months. July figures on
consumer prices are to be published Aug. 23.

<HEAD>AT&T To Offer Karmarkar Algorithm Commercially</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said Friday
it was offering a computer-based system for solving business
problems that is based on a formula invented in 1984 by Bell
Laboratories mathematician Narendra Karmarkar.
   AT&T said the system would cost $8.9 million, including free
training, and would be ideal for customers such as airlines and
companies in the process industries, such as oil, chemicals and
paper.
   The Karmarkar algorithm greatly speeds up the solution of
mathematical problems that involve the interaction of thousands of
variables. It was originally used to help AT&T plan the growth of
its phone network.
   AT&T said an airline, for example, could use the system to
improve the efficiency of its routing system, including the
scheduling and allocation of planes and crews. Chemical companies
could use it to balance the input of raw materials and the output
of final products, AT&T said.
   The system, known as Korbx, is being offered by a new AT&T unit,
Advanced Decision Support Systems, based in Whippany, N.J. Some
systems, but fewer than 10, have been sold, said the new unit's
president, Aristides Fronistas.
   The Karmarkar algorithm traces a path inside the ``region'' of
all potential solutions to a problem until it arrives at the best
one. An algorithm is simply a rule of thumb, or a special method
for solving a certain kind of problem.
   Bell Laboratories received three patents related to the Korbx
system in May.

   Stock prices lost more ground today as rising
interest rates kept the pressure on the market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 3.20 to 2,036.10
by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
563 up, 763 down and 546 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 146.43 million shares with two
hours to go.
   A big chunk of that activity was concentrated in a few electric
utility issues that were the targets of trading strategies keyed to
their approaching dividend payments.
   Otherwise, analysts said the market was weak and listless, still
struggling to recover its balance after the Federal Reserve's move
Tuesday to raise its discount rate.
   In the credit markets today, prices of long-term government
bonds fell by roughly $5 for each $1,000 in face value, putting
their yields in the 9.45-9.5 percent range.
   The report that the producer price index of finished goods rose
0.5 percent in July was in line with advance estimates. But
analysts said some traders were troubled by the 0.6 percent
increase in the index after the volatile food and energy components
were excluded.
   Among actively traded blue chips, General Electric rose ] to
40]; American Telephone & Telegraph fell { to 25], and American
Express was down \ at 27}.
   National Semiconductor dropped ] to 9~ in active trading. The
company said it will take a one-time charge of about $18 million in
its current fiscal quarter, and also said it believed analysts'
estimates of its earnings for the quarter were too high.
   Trans World Airlines climbed 1] to 36{. The company scheduled a
shareholder meeting for Sept. 7 to vote on Chairman Carl Icahn's
proposal to take the company private.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost

<HEAD>California Considers Deregulating Some Interest Rates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California's retail stores would be
able to charge unlimited interest rates on their credit-card
accounts under legislation being considered by Gov. George
Deukmejian.
   The proposal, supported by the retailers but opposed by consumer
groups, would repeal during a three-year period the current 18
percent interest ceiling that was established 28 years ago. Bank
credit cards would not be affected.
   Democratic state Sen. Ralph Dills, who introduced the bill, said
current limit prevents stores from offering credit to poorer
consumers.
   The no-limit interest policy would ``open up some credit
opportunities that don't exist at this time,'' added Democratic
Assemblyman Dick Floyd.
   But critics charge the proposal would result in $450 million in
additional interest charges over three years.
   Assemblyman Lloyd Connelly, a Democrat, described the measure as
``clearly the worst consumer bill of the year.'' He said California
consumers pay an extra $50 million in interest rates for each
percentage point added to interest rates by stores.
   Deukmejian, in 1982, 1984 and 1986, approved temporary increases
in the interest limit to 19.2 percent. However, last year the
governor vetoed another increase, noting that the prime lending
rate had fallen from over 20 percent in 1980 to between 8 percent
and 9 percent in 1987, and ``the record is devoid of evidence
supporting the need for the higher ceiling.''
   Deukmejian, who rarely discusses pending legislation, has
declined to discuss his position on the bill. He has until the end
of this month to decide its fate.
   The Assembly approved the bill in a 49-22 vote Monday; the
Senate passed it in June.
   The bill would take effect Jan. 1, 1989 and expire three years
later, at which time the Legislature could decide to extend or kill
it based on a review by a non-partisan state legislative analyst.
   Assemblyman Frank Hill, a Republican who was a key backer of the
bill, said that if stores are limited to 18 percent they can offer
credit only to customers considered lower risks or raise their
prices to compensate for the loss.
   The current ceiling ``is hurting California consumers as well as
the retail industry,'' Hill said. Deregulation would ``let the
marketplace set the rates.''
   Democratic Assemblyman Rusty Aerias, a critic of the bill, said
that a New York study found that stores actually did not offer poor
people more credit after deregulation. ``This is a reverse Robin
Hood where we're robbing from the poor,'' he said.
   According to an Assembly finance committee, 16 other states have
deregulated retail credit.

   A severe shortage of computer memory chips is
slowly beginning to ease, but U.S. electronics makers remain deeply
concerned about their vulnerability to Japan's control of the
critical components.
   Memory chips are the plywood of the worldwide electronics
industry _ essential to products ranging from personal computers to
copying machines.
   The supply crunch has left U.S. electronics makers wringing
their hands over lost sales, foregone profits, delayed product
introductions and worsened relations with customers.
   Although Japanese companies such as NEC Corp., Hitachi Ltd. and
Toshiba Corp. account for 80 to 90 percent of worldwide sales of
memory chips, few people are accusing those companies of
delibrately engineering the shortages.
   In fact, there is a shortage of memory chips inside Japan, which
has surpassed the United States to become the world's largest
consumer of chips.
   ``Some major, major major corporations in Japan can't find
product. They're coming to us,'' said Larry Gurewitz, an owner of
H&R Enterprises in Canoga Park, Calif., which deals in used and
surplus chips.
   Nevertheless, the vulnerability of U.S. companies to Japanese
suppliers has been highlighted by the chip squeeze. The dominance
in memory chips gives the Japanese a base to solidify control of
the products that use the chips.
   ``The Japanese have a large stake in supplanting (U.S.-based)
merchant producers as the providers of leading-edge chip
technologies,'' said Michael G. Borrus, deputy director of the
Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy.
   If the Japanese companies succeed in gaining unquestioned
leadership in chip technology, they will be able to reserve the
latest chips for their own computers, phone switches, satellites
and other equipment before making them available to U.S. and
European rivals, Borrus said.
   ``At stake for the U.S. economy is not simply the $25 billion
market for semiconductors, but the current $0.5 trillion market for
the final products that incorporate semiconductors, soon to be a $1
trillion market,'' Borrus writes in a new book, ``Competing for
Control: America's Stake in Microelectronics.''
   So far the threat from Japan is more theoretical than real. For
example, Toshiba, the world's biggest producer of 1-megabit DRAMs
(pronounced dee-rams), allocates more than 60 percent of its output
of the chips to U.S. customers even though its own personal
computer unit in Japan is short on them.
   But the potential for manipulation is starkly obvious,
especially considering that DRAMs can account for up to a quarter
of the cost of building a computer.
   Sun Microsystems Inc. is one company that has felt the sting of
the chip shortage. The booming Silicon Valley maker of computer
workstations, which just cracked the $1 billion barrier in annual
sales, says its revenue would have been $100 million higher if chip
shortages had not delayed deliveries.
   Sun occupies a market that Japanese competitors have scarcely
touched, yet is heavily dependent on chips from companies that are
potential rivals.
   A similar dilemma faces another U.S. computer industry star,
Cray Research Inc., which relies on Japanese-made chips at the same
time it fends off Japanese challenges to its role as the world's
leading maker of supercomputers.
   Cray has never taken a position on whether a strong, U.S.-based
semiconductor industry is needed.
   Ironically, for all the problems of a chip shortage, the
greatest long-term danger to the U.S. electronics industry could
come from an eventual chip glut.
   The last glut drove several of the biggest U.S.-based DRAM
suppliers out of the business because they could not afford the
huge losses, and the next one could wreak similar havoc.
   Japanese companies are better able to sustain losses on chips
because they make other products that tide them over. In the United
States, only International Business Machines Corp. is in a similar
position. IBM is the world's largest DRAM producer, but sells none
to outsiders.
   The only two U.S.-based companies that still sell DRAMs on the
open market are Texas Instruments Inc. and Micron Technology Inc.,
which have earned windfall profits that will enable them to keep
current on the technology.
   For now, a bust in memory chip prices is still a distant threat.
Toshiba, in a statement prepared for The Associated Press, said
``we are afraid that the current unusual supply-demand relations
will not ease until the middle of 1989.''
   Shortages of the older 256-kilobit DRAMs could prevail even
longer because production lines for them have been retooled for the
new chips. There are also growing shortages of 1-megabit static
random access memories, or SRAMs.
   Average U.S. spot prices have fallen to $37 apiece in July from
$47.50 in April for the most advanced memory chips in mass
production, the 1 million-bit dynamic random access memories known
as 1-megabit DRAMs.
   That is still way above the $19.50 spot price that prevailed in
July 1987, according to Dataquest Inc., the market research firm.
   In April, some desperate customers paid as much as $65 apiece
for small quantities of 1-megabit DRAMs, according to Mark Giudice
of Dataquest. It became common for companies to pillage memory
chips from older computers and other equipment.
   The supply squeeze in memory chips seems to have two main
sources, the main one being the sticky transition to the new,
hard-to-build megabit chips from the older 256-kilobit variety.
   Producing the new chips demands unprecedented precision and
cleanliness, and it has taken chipmakers longer than expected to
gear up production. At the same time, a boom in sales of personal
computers and other gear has increased the demand for the chips.
   A secondary reason for the squeeze is the 1986 accord between
the United States and Japan to prevent ``dumping'' of Japanese-made
chips at unfairly low prices. In order to prop up prices to comply
with the accord, the Japanese government instructed its chip makers
to hold back on production.
   That anti-dumping accord was supposed to lure more U.S.
companies back into producing DRAMs by guaranteeing them some
protection when chip prices begin skidding, an inevitable process
given the improving yields from existing fabrication lines and the
start-up of new ones.
   So far, though, few companies have been lured back. Motorola
Inc. is starting up DRAM production again. But American Telephone &
Telegraph Co., in spite of the accord, dropped out of the DRAM
business last year.
   The reluctance of U.S. companies to enter or stay in the market
is understandable considering the roughly $300 million it takes to
build a state-of-the-art fabrication plant and the boom-bust nature
of chip prices.
   In the long run, many analysts say, sustaining a healthy chip
industry in the United States will probably depend on more
government initiatives such as the anti-dumping accord and _
importantly _ closer cooperation between U.S. chipmakers and U.S.
chip users.
   ``We're both realizing that adversarial isn't the best way to
go,'' said Stan Victor, a Texas Instruments spokesman.

<TEXT>
   Car owners involved in a lawsuit alleging some of
Audi of America's cars are defective are forming a ``barricuda
network'' to attack the company after a judge threw out a tentative
settlement, a company official contended Friday.
   Cook County Circuit Judge Thomas Rakowski on Thursday threw out
the proposed settlement between the company and a class of Audi car
owners who alleged that Audi 5000 sedans suddenly accelerate
without warning.
   ``I sense a barricuda network setting up where everybody wants
to get a piece of the meat and to get into the deep pockets of
Audi,'' said Tom McDonald, a spokesman for Volkswagen of America
Inc., of which Troy, Mich.-based Audi is a subsidiary.
   McDonald contended Friday that the Audi Victims Network, a group
of Audi car owners based in Washington, D.C., was advising some of
its members to withdraw from the class-action lawsuit and file
individual lawsuits against the company. Such a move could cost the
company thousands of dollars in legal fees, he said.
   McDonald said only 1,500 of the 340,000 owners of the Audi
sedans covered by the proposed settlement of the class-action
lawsuit refused to agree to it. He blamed the settlement's
rejection on the victims network.
   ``The Audi Victims Network has not been a headache to us, it's
been a major disease to Audi,'' McDonald said.
   Stephen Nassau, an attorney for the victims network, said he had
advised his clients to withdraw from the class-action suit because,
under terms of the proposed settlement, owners would have had to
buy another Audi.
   The group of about 800 Audi owners contend their cars suddenly
accelerate without warning, Nassau said.
   ``Some people have put their cars away and refuse to drive or
sell them,'' he said. ``Why would they want to buy another one?
   ``I would say if we were barricudas, there must be sharks
circling in the waters as well,'' he said, referring to Audi
officials trying to eliminate complaints from car owners.
   The case stems from a 1987 class-action lawsuit alleging that
Audi 5000s were defective because of sudden acceleration problems.
The settlement would have applied to owners of Audi 5000s built
between 1978 and 1986.
   Audi officials maintain that owners have been unable to prove
their Audi 5000 sedans have any defects and say the settlement
rejected by Rakowski is fair.
   Under terms of the settlement, proposed in June by attorneys for
both sides, Audi car owners who bought another Audi would have been
offered rebates of up to $2,000, but would have had to free the
company from all liability.
   The judge recommended Thursday that both sides try to negotiate
a new settlement and report any progress at a hearing scheduled for
Aug. 31.
   ``After the ruling, we have to look at all our options,''
McDonald said. ``One option is to renegotiate; the other is to
litigate.''
   Nassau said the victims network may ask the judge to let them
become a third party in the case.
   ``There's no question that we're going to be watching to see
what happens next,'' Nassau said a day after Rakowski approved his
motion to throw out a previous judge's ruling giving preliminary
approval to the settlement.
   Nassau's motion called for vacating Circuit Judge Harold
Siegan's earlier ruling, contending the judge had not given
``proper scrutiny'' to the matter before approving it.
   After giving the proposed settlement the preliminary go-ahead,
Siegan removed himself from the case in July, saying he had a
potential conflict of interest because he was friends with an
attorney in the case.
   Thursday's ruling was a victory for the Center for Auto Safety,
a Washington-based group formed by consumer activist Ralph Nader.
The center contended that the Audi acceleration problem was linked
to at least 1,650 accidents, causing 402 injuries and five deaths.

<HEAD>Shareholders Suing To Block Management Buyout Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least five groups of Insilco Corp.
shareholders have filed suit against the company, seeking to thwart
a $950 million management-led leveraged buyout they consider
``grossly unfair and inadequate.''
   Insilco's board of directors accepted the $29-a-share offer
earlier this month in what some analysts described as an
anti-takeover defense for the high-technology and specialty
consumer products concern.
   In a leveraged buyout a company is acquired largely with
boreowed money repaid from the target company's profits or asset
sales.
   Stockholders want to prevent that deal from being completed. In
complaints filed in New Haven Superior Court, they charge Insilco
would be worth a lot more in ``an open auction for the company.''
   ``The directors have the duty to maximize shareholder value,''
William Barnes, an attorney for Sam and Marilyn Pill of Brooklyn,
N.Y., wrote in one of five civil suits filed Tuesday.
   Insilco disclosed in filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission last week that it received several unsolicited buyout
offers since the management bid. It said it entered into
confidentiality agreements with certain groups but declined to
identify the parties.
   Insilco Vice President and Treasurer Malcolm Todt said Thursday
the company believes the tender offer from management is fair.
   Named as defendants were Insilco, 12 directors and ISC Holdings
Inc., the new holding company created by Insilco management to
acquire the Meriden-based company.
   In recent years, Insilco, once known as the International Silver
Co., has restructured itself into an industrial holding company
with operating companies that make products for high-technology
industries and speciality consumer markets.
   Insilco makes Red Devil paints, Rolodex rotary files, metal
cartridges and other projectiles for the defense industry and
Dual-Lite emergency lighting equipment.
   Insilco earned $11.7 million, or 55 cents per share, in the
second quarter, compared with $11 million, or 52 cents a share,
last year. Revenue totaled $196.4 million, up from $154.3 million.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade, surprising many analysts who
had expected a strong performance following the government's crop
production report.
   Corn, oat and soybean futures opened sharply higher as expected
but corn prices plunged their permitted daily limit shortly after
the opening, sparking a sell-off in the adjacent trading pits. Only
oat futures closed higher while most corn futures finished down the
10-cents-a-bushel limit.
   ``It's astonishing,'' said Katharina Zimmer, grain analyst with
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York.
   In a report issued after the markets closed on Thursday, the
USDA predicted the drought would lower this year's U.S. corn
production by 37 compared to last year. The agency estimated
soybean production at 23 percent below last year's level and said
wheat production would drop by 14 percent.
   ``I guess the markets may be giving us a signal today that the
USDA report did not provide any new bullish information that wasn't
already in the market,'' said Mario Balletto, Merill Lynch's
soybean analyst.
   Balletto said traders apparently want to see signs of new export
business before they are willing to bet on higher prices.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 4{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.80 a bushel; corn was 4\
cents to 10 cents lower with September at $2.87\ a bushel; oats
were 4{ cents to 6{ cents higher with September at $2.80 a bushel;
and soybeans were 11 cents lower to 6 cents higher with August at
$8.50 a bushel.

   The securities arm of National Westminster Bank
PLC said it fired two market-makers in stocks for insider trading.
   County Natwest Woodmac Ltd. said Friday that, as one of three
stockbrokers of Grand Metropolitan PLC, it was informed on Monday
that Grand Met was about to announce its intention to sell its
Inter-Continental hotel chain after several parties had shown an
interest.
   County Natwest said that ``through a breach of internal
procedures, which did not involve (the) corporate finance
department, this information reached two market-makers.''
   The two market-makers, Russell Kean and Stephen Floyd, dealt in
Grand Met shares even though they had been informed that they could
not because they were ``in receipt of privileged information,'' the
company said.
   Kean traded 2 million pounds, or about $3.4 million, worth of
shares of Grand Met, a major British hotels and beverage company,
County Natwest said.
   The two men were fired Wednesday after the London Stock Exchange
detected what it regarded as suspicious trading and traced it back
to County Natwest.
   Kean's lawyer said Kean made no personal profit through the
share dealings connected with his dismissal.

   Stock prices drifted lower today as rising
interest rates kept a damper on the market.
   Analysts said the market was weak and listless, still struggling
to recover its balance after the Federal Reserve's move Tuesday to
raise its discount rate.
   In the credit markets today, prices of long-term government
bonds declined slightly, putting their yields in the 9.42-9.5
percent range.
   The Labor Department's report that the producer price index of
finished goods rose 0.5 percent in July was in line with advance
estimates. But analysts said some traders were troubled by the 0.6
percent increase in the index after the volatile food and energy
components were excluded.

<HEAD>Last Family Member Of Neiman-Marcus Leaving</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Marcus said Friday he is leaving as
chairman of the pricey retailer Neiman-Marcus, marking the end of
the Marcus family's affiliation with the deparment store founded by
his grandfather in 1907.
   Marcus, who was also chief executive of the 22-store,
Dallas-based chain, said he would have no further direct connection
with the famous retailer.
   Marcus, 50, is the last founding family member to hold a
corporate position in the 81-year-old Dallas institution founded by
Herbert Marcus Sr. that over the years has attracted international
attention and prestige.
   Today, the Neiman-Marcus stores are part of Neiman-Marcus Group
Inc., which also includes the retailers Bergdorf-Goodman and
Contempo Casuals. Neiman-Marcus Group is owned by General Cinema
Corp., which also owns movie houses and soft-drink bottling
concerns.
   Allen I. Questrom, 48, a former vice chairman of Federated
Department Stores Inc., has been named president and chief
executive of Neiman-Marcus stores. Questrom left Federated in May,
after Toronto-based Campeau Corp. took control of the
Cincinnati-based retailer.
   Marcus' resignation is effective Sept. 1, while Questrom will
join the company Sept. 7, Neiman-Marcus said in a statement.
   For the past nine months, the company had been trying to fill
the vacancy left by the departure of its president and chief
operating officer, David Dworkin.
   The title of chairman will not exist in the new Neiman-Marcus
corporate structure, officials said. Questrom will report to Robert
J. Tarr Jr., president and chief operating officer of Neiman-Marcus
Group and General Cinema.
   Marcus, who became chairman in 1978, said in an interview with
the Dallas Morning News Thursday he felt comfortable with handing
the reins to Questrom although he had not yet formulated his next
business plans.
   After graduating from Harvard University, Marcus joined the
store in 1962 at age 24 as an assistant buyer. He moved up through
the ranks and was named president 10 years later.
   ``Some management science book said 10 years as CEO is long
enough, at least for the company, if not the individual,'' Marcus
said.
   Referring to Questrom's impending arrival, Marcus said, ``We
have the type of stewardship that allows me with confidence to
explore some other ideas and opportunities.''
   Before being named Federated vice chairman in January, Questrom
was chairman and chief executive officer of Los Angeles-based
Bullock's, a subsidiary of Federated now owned by R.H. Macy & Co.
Inc. From 1978 to 1984, Questrom was chairman and chief executive
of Federated's Atlanta-based Rich's division.

   The dollar fluctuated without direction against
major foreign currencies Friday as traders began looking ahead to
next week's release of U.S. monthly trade figures.
   Gold prices rose. Republic National Bank of New York said gold
was bid at $431 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $429.30 an
ounce late Thursday.
   Traders are reluctant to hold big currency positions because of
the possibility of a surprise Tuesday when the Commerce Department
releases the June merchandise trade deficit.
   Many traders are expecting a shortfall of $10 billion to $12
billion. The deficit was $10.9 billion in May.
   The dollar was weakened only briefly by a government report that
wholesale prices rose at an annual rate of 5.7 percent in July,
said Rick Lloyd, foreign exchange and money market trading manager
for Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles.
   Keith Dipple, chief dealer at Banque Francaise de Commerce
Exterieure, said the dollar still was suffering from a market
perception that it moved a ``little too far, too quickly'' Tuesday
when it shot up following the U.S. Federal Reserve's
half-percentage point increase in its key bank lending rate, the
discount rate.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.7155 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.7010 Thursday. The
dollar also weakened later in New York, as sterling rose to $1.7130
from $1.7103.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar finished the week at 133.05 yen, down 1.02 yen from
Thursday's close. Later, in London, it was quoted at 133.15 yen. In
New York, the dollar rose to 133.28 yen from 132.74 late Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.8833 West German marks, unchanged;
1.5777 Swiss francs, up from 1.5735; 1.2111 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.2198; 6.3965 French francs, up from 6.3863; and 1,397.50
Italian lire, unchanged.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday,
included: 1.8805 West German marks, down from 1.8995; 1.5750 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5905; 6.3810 French francs, down from 6.4350;
2.1146 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1425; 1,395.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,406.50; and 1.2195 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2231.
   In Hong Kong, gold fell 80 cents a troy ounce to close at a bid
$430.99 an ounce.
   Later, gold rose in London to a late bid price of $431.50 a troy
ounce, compared with late Thursday's bid of $428.
   In Zurich, gold closed at a bid $432.50 an ounce, compared with
$428.65 late Thursday.
   At the end of the trading day on the Commodity Exchange in New
York, gold bullion for current delivery rose to $431.30 a troy
ounce from $429.30 late Thursday.
   Silver bullion rose on the London market to a late bid price of
$6.73 a troy ounce from $6.70 Thursday. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery rose to $6.712 a troy ounce from
$6.685 Thursday.

   Stock prices declined slightly in a sluggish
session Friday under the continuing influence of rising interest
rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 1.78 to
2,037.52, extending its loss for the week to 81.61 points.
   That ranked as the biggest weekly decline for the average since
it fell 108.42 points March 21-25.
   Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advances on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 679 up, 742 down and 530 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 176.96 million
shares, against 173 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 198 million shares.
   A big chunk of the day's activity was concentrated in a few
electric utility issues that were the targets of trading strategies
keyed to their approaching dividend payments.
   Otherwise, analysts said the market was weak and listless, still
struggling to recover its balance after the Federal Reserve's move
Tuesday to raise its discount rate.
   In the credit markets Friday, prices of long-term government

   Bond prices declined moderately Friday, rounding
out a traumatic week of steep losses that catapulted interest rates
to their highest levels this year.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond fell about ] point,
or $3.75 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves
inversely to its price and is often an indicator of interest rate
trends, rose to 9.42 percent from 9.38 percent late Thursday.
   The yield on the 30-year bond has not been this high since Dec.
11, 1987, when it reached 9.44 percent.
   Bond prices took a beating this week after the Federal Reserve
raised its discount rate on Tuesday. The increase in the discount
rate, the interest the Fed charges on loans to major financial
institutions, was the first such hike since last October's stock
market crash. A rise in interest rates sends bond prices lower.
   The central bank raised the discount rate a half-percentage
point, to 6.5 percent, to stem inflationary pressure on the
economy. Many market watchers had expected the Fed to tighten its
reins on the money supply _ but few were anticipating that dramatic
a move.
   ``It's just been a lousy week,'' said Mitchell Held, chief
financial economist for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   He suggested that Friday's more tempered decline in bond values
was caused by a residue of negative sentiment from the week.
   The yield on the key 30-year issue jumped from 9.10 percent on
Monday, the day before the discount-rate hike, to Friday's 9.42
percent.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds Friday, prices of
short-term government issues were unchanged to 1-32 point lower,
intermediate maturities slipped 5-32 point to 3-16 point, and
20-year issues lost 5-32 point, according to figures provided by
Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, edged up 0.67 to 1,126.55.
   Corporate bonds were slightly lower. Moody's Investment Grade
Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, slipped
0.02 to 280.28.
   Three-month Treasury bills, meanwhile, edged up 1 basis point to
a discounted rate of 7.00 percent and a yield of 7.21 percent.
Six-month bills rose 3 basis points to a discounted rate of 7.45
percent to yield 7.84 percent while one-year bills were up 1 basis
point at 7.65 percent to yield 8.21 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discounted rate is the interest rate the market uses to price bills.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 8[ percent, up from 8 1-16
percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>Shamrock Boosts Offer for Polaroid But Camera Giant Takes No
Action</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investment firm owned by a Disney
family scion sweetened its takeover bid for Polaroid Corp. on
Friday, and the camera company's board met for six hours before
postponing action on the offer.
   Analysts interpreted the new offer by Shamrock Holdings Inc. of
Burbank, Calif., as an effort to gradually raise the stakes for the
instant camera pioneer.
   ``It's all part of a very delicate quadrille being danced by a
large number of players and all we're seeing is the first two
steps,'' one Wall Street analyst said.
   Shamrock's new offer was $40 a share plus giving stockholders
the right to 40 percent of any settlement in Polaroid's $5.7
billion patent infringement case against Eastman Kodak Co.
   That bettered the July 22 bid, which offered a flat $40 a share
for Polaroid, or about $2.3 billion, but attached several
contingencies.
   On Wall Street, Polaroid's stock fell $1 a share to $42.12{.
   After the board meeting, Polaroid said in a statement no action
was taken because of the new bid. The 13-member board planned to
meet again to consider the offer, but no date was set, spokeswoman
Marcia Phillips said.
   Analysts said Shamrock's bid fell short of what Polaroid would
be willing to consider but might be part of a strategy to heighten
interest in the company that introduced instant snapshots more than
50 years ago.
   ``I think they don't expect it to be a blitzkrieg,'' said Peter
Enderlin of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. ``I think they're
prepared for a drawn-out struggle or possibly even drawn-out
negotiations.''
   Shamrock, wholly owned by the family of Roy E. Disney, nephew of
the late Walt Disney, has interests in three television and 14
radio stations, an energy services company and 56 home
entertainment software stores in Los Angeles.
   The company failed in an attempt last year to acquire Wherehouse
Entertainment Inc., which analysts said raises questions about its
ability to go after Polaroid, which reported sales of $13.3 billion
last year.
   ``They're trying to prove they're for real but nobody's too
sure,'' said William Relyea of Eberstadt Fleming Inc. ``There's a
very healthy degree of skepticism about what they're up to.''
   In its new bid, Shamrock, which owns 6.9 percent of Polaroid,
rescinded an earlier requirement making a deal contingent on
Polaroid dropping a $190 million pension surplus plan. But it said
it would continue to fight a recently announced employee stock
ownership plan that includes the issue of 10 million new shares.
   Shamrock said it had retained Wertheim Schroder & Co. and Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. to assist in securing about $1 billion in
financing. The new offer was made in a letter from Shamrock
chairman Stanley Gold to Polaroid president I. MacAllister Booth.
   ``We are willing to meet with you at any time to discuss how
best to implement the furnishing of such an interest to Polaroid's
shareholders,'' Gold wrote in the letter dated Thursday and
released Friday.
   Shamrock has filed suit in a Delaware court seeking to overturn
the employee stock plan, part of a corporate restructuring that
includes 500 to 800 layoffs, a $300 million stock repurchase and
entry into the conventional film market. Polaroid is officially a
Delaware company.
   Under Delaware law, an acquiring company must have at least 85
percent of the target company's stock to complete a merger. By
placing 14 percent of its stock in employee hands, Polaroid has
effectively put the 85 percent target out of reach.
   Shamrock's lawsuit charges that Polaroid enacted the plan as an
antitakeover device. Polaroid said in March the plan would equal 5
percent of company stock but raised the amount about 10 days before
the first Shamrock bid.
   Analysts called the new bid speculative because it depends on
settling the patent infringement case against Kodak, which was
found guilty in 1985 of violating several Polaroid patents on
instant cameras and film. The $5.7 billion damages trial is set to
begin in January.
   Shamrock's takeover bid values the company at about $2.88
billion if all 71.9 million shares remain outstanding. If the stock
issue is rolled back, the value of the company implied by the bid
would be $2.48 billion.
   Since Shamrock already owns a chunk of Polaroid stock, its cost
to buy the rest would be $2.28 billion, assuming defeat of the
share issue, or $2.68 billion if the share issue is not defeated.

<HEAD>Maxwell Sets Tender Offer for Macmillan, But Willing To Talk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British publisher Robert Maxwell said Friday he
will launch a $2.1 billion cash tender offer for Macmillan Inc.
next week, but made clear his main interest is acquiring its
information services business.
   Macmillan already is the subject of a $1.9 billion bid from
Robert M. Bass Group Inc., a Texas-based investment group.
   In a letter to Macmillan, Maxwell said he would drop his
$80-a-share tender offer if Macmillan would sell him the
information company, which Macmillan proposed to separate from its
publishing business in a corporate restructuring.
   Maxwell said his Maxwell Communications Corp. PLC would be
willing to pay ``not less than $1.1 billion'' in cash for the
information business, noting that Macmillan's investment bankers
had valued it at ``a range of $800 million to slightly in excess of
$1 billion.''
   In the letter, Maxwell also told Macmillan Chairman Edward P.
Evans he was ``willing to explore other forms of transactions with
you'' that would allow current shareholders to continue to hold a
significant stake in the company.
   Maxwell also reitereated he wanted to retain Macmillan
management.
   Macmillan declined to comment on Maxwell's proposals.
   On Wall Street, the price of Macmillan stock rose $1.50 a share
to $83.25, indicating investors expected the bidding to escalate.
   ``Some people suggested Maxwell isn't serious, but by launching
a tender offer at $80 a share on Monday, we see he is serious,''
said Bert Boksen, who follows the publishing business for the
brokerage Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla.
   But Boksen said by making the alternate suggestion that he be
sold the information assets, Maxwell ``identified the piece he is
most interested in.''
   ``I think Macmillan is backed up against the wall and will try
to find a white knight,'' he said. He said Macmillan could be worth
$90 a share.
   The overture from Maxwell came only three days before a
scheduled court hearing in Delaware on whether Macmillan should be
allowed to proceed with its proposed restructuring.
   The restructuring, announced in late May, would split the
company into separate publishing and information services concerns
and pay shareholders a special dividend of $52.35 a share in cash.
   That plan was advanced after the Bass Group proposed to pay $64
a share for the Macmillan stock it did not already own. The Bass
Group subsequently sweetened its offer twice, and launched its own
tender offer for Macmillan at $75 a share.
   The Bass Group won an order from Delaware Chancery Court
blocking Macmillan from proceeding with its restructuring.
Macmillan appealed the decision to Delaware Supreme Court, which
scheduled a hearing for Monday.
   Maxwell disclosed his interest in Macmillan in mid-July, saying
he would be interested in paying $80 a share for its 25.9 million
shares in a friendly transaction.
   A Maxwell spokesman said Friday that the tender offer at that
price would commence on Monday. It is contingent on dropping the
restructuring plan, among other things, but Maxwell said it is not
conditioned upon obtaining necessary financing.
   Late last month, the Macmillan board rejected the $75 a share
offer from Bass as inadequate, but took no position on the Maxwell
proposal.
   Macmillan spokesman David Jackson refused Friday to comment on
whether the board has since met to discuss the Maxwell proposal, or
anything else.
   Maxwell has vowed to make Maxwell Communications one of the
world's biggest media and communications businesses. Through that
company and Pergamon Press, Maxwell controls the Mirror Group of
newspapers in Great Britain, is one of America's largest printers
of magazines and catlogues and has extensive holdings in publishing
academic and scientific journals.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Decline Despite Bullish Crop Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly lower Friday on
the Chicago Board of Trade, astonishing analysts who had expected a
strong performance following the government's pessimistic crop
production report.
   The volatility of the grain markets, attributed by some to
massive trades by a handful of firms, sent tremors through several
other commodity markets that frequently look to Chicago for
direction.
   Sugar and cotton futures plunged; livestock and meat futures
were mostly lower; precious metals advanced; energy futures were
lower; and stock-index futures retreated.
   Corn, oat and soybean futures opened sharply higher as expected.
But corn prices plunged their permitted daily limit of 10 cents a
bushel shortly after the opening, sparking a sell-off in the
adjacent trading pits.
   Only oat futures closed higher while most corn futures finished
limit down.
   ``It's astonishing,'' said Katharina Zimmer, grain analyst with
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York. ``I really don't
understand it.''
   ``I've been doing this for eight years and this is my most
frustrating day ever,'' said Richard Loewy, senior grain and
oilseed analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   In a report issued Thursday afternoon, the Agriculture
Department predicted the Midwestern drought would lower this year's
U.S. corn production by 37 percent, soybean production by 23
percent and wheat production by 14 percent compared to last year's
yields.
   Analysts had expected a sharp rise in crop futures prices
Friday, reflecting the increasing value of diminishing grain
supplies. But after the initial surge, several large trading firms
sold huge amounts of corn, which sent corn prices plummeting.
   Traders said Chicago-based C&D Commodities sold at least 20
million bushels of corn alone. Other large sellers reportedly
included Refco Inc., Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Merrill Lynch
Futures Inc.
   Loewy said a handful of firms were bullying the grain markets.
But Mario Balletto, Merrill Lynch's soybean analyst, said the
sell-off would not had occurred if the market's major players had
truly been surprised by the USDA crop estimates.
   ``I guess the markets may be giving us a signal today that the
USDA report did not provide any new bullish information that wasn't
already in the market,'' Balletto said.
   Wheat settled 1 cent to 3{ cents lower with the contract for
delivery in September at $3.79} bushel; corn was 3} cents to 10
cents lower with September at $2.87\ a bushel; oats were 4{ cents
to 6{ cents higher with September at $2.80 a bushel; soybeans were
12 cents lower to 2{ cents higher with August at $8.48{ a bushel.
   Cotton futures prices collapsed in reaction to the crop report,
which projected a 1.2 percent increase in cotton production while
virtually every analyst was expecting a reduction.
   Cotton futures settled down the 2-cents-a-pound limit across the
board on the New York Cotton Exchange with the contract for October
delivery at 53.28 cents a pound.
   Sugar futures followed the grain markets' wild swing and closed
sharply lower on New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange.
   ``There's an old saying: `When in doubt, get out,''' said Erik
Dunlaevy, a sugar trader with Balfour Maclaine Corp. in New York.
``If you don't understand the market, don't get into it, get out of
it.''
   Sugar for October delivery settled .63 cent lower at 10.77 cents
a pound.
   Cattle and pork futures finished mixed to lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Analysts said the lower grain futures _
portending lower feed prices and possibly higher meat supplies _
were the main influence.
   Live cattle settled .18 cent lower to .23 cent higher with
August at 69.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to
.15 cent higher with August at 81.05 cents a pound; hogs were 1.12
cents lower to .28 cent higher with August at 46.90 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were 1.15 cents to 1.55 cents lower with August
at 34.17 cents a pound.
   Precious metals futures advanced on news that wholesale prices
climbed 0.5 percent in July, said Peter Cardillo, commodity futures
trading adviser for Josephthal & Co. in New York.
   Gold settled $2 higher across the board with August at $431.30 a
troy ounce; silver was 2.5 cents to 2.7 cents higher with September
at $6.74 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures prices retreated in technically-inspired trading
on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 26 cents
lower with September at $15.52 a barrel; heating oil was .30 cent
to .56 cent lower with September at 44 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .04 cent to .53 cent lower with September at 45.98
cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures retreated slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for September delivery of the Standard
& Poor's 500 stock index settled .65 point lower at 262.55.

<HEAD>Union Pacific Assumes Control Of Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union Pacific Railroad assumed control Friday
of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad, railroad officials announced.
   In a news release, Union Pacific said the takeover had been
approved May 18 by the Interstate Commerce Commission.
   Union Pacific reached agreement with Katy Industries in 1986 to
acquire its railroad, more commonly known as the Katy, for
approximately $110 million and assume its $250 million debt.
   Operational changes on the Katy will be phased in to assure a
smooth transition, Union Pacific said.
   Union Pacific said the changes will be made as labor agreements
are reached outlining employee transfers and other details. One
move will be the installation of Union Pacific's Transportation
Control System on Katy routes, bringing Union Pacific's
computerized customer service program to Katy shippers.
   The Katy is a 3,100-mile regional railroad connecting the
Midwest with the Texas Gulf Coast. Union Pacific and Katy have had
several joint operating arrangements to use of each other's tracks.
   Union Pacific serves the West Coast, Texas Gulf Coast and such
major trade cities as Chicago, St. Louis, Memphis, Tenn.; and New
Orleans.

<HEAD>Macmillan Reports Lower Second-Quarter Net</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK N(AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Takeover target Macmillan Inc. on Thursday
reported its second-quarter net income slipped 9 percent despite
higher sales.
   Separately, the Robert M. Bass Group said it was extending its
$1.95 billion bid for the pubishing and information services giant.
The Texas-based Bass group has been joined by British media magnate
Robert Maxwell in the bid for Macmillan.
   Net income for the quarter ended June 30 totaled $13.2 million,
or 49 cents a share, compared with $14.5 million, or 57 cents a
share, in the year-ago period. The company noted that 1987 results
reflected a $3.8 million gain from the sale of the company's
software division.
   Revenue during the quarter rose 11 percent to $241 million,
compared with $217.5 million in the second quarter of 1987.
   For the first six months, Macmillan reported net income of $10.6
million, or 43 cents a share, down 12 percent from $12 million, or
49 cents a share, in the year-ago period.
   Revenue during the first two quarters were up 11 percent at
$423.6 million, from $382.6 million a year ago.
   The Bass group began bidding for Macmillan in May. Its
$75-a-share tender offer for the company, which was to expire
Friday, has been extended to Aug. 26. The Bass group apparently
wants to keep its offer alive while the two sides meet again in
court.
   A hearing has been scheduled for Aug. 15 in Macmillan's bid to
overturn a preliminary injunction that the Delaware Chancery Court
had granted Bass in an effort to block Macmillan's defensive
restructuring plan.
   While the two sides were squabbling in court, Maxwell
Communication Corp. came on the scene with an $80-a-share bid that
values Macmillan at $2.32 billion.
   Maxwell's bid is conditioned upon termination of Macmillan's
restructuring plan and redemption of the company's poison pill.

   The operator of Pennsylvania's Peach Bottom
nuclear power plant has been fined $1.25 million, the largest fine
in Nuclear Regulatory Commission history, because 33 reactor
workers slept or were negligent on the job.
   The NRC on Thursday also announced fines ranging from $500 to
$1,000 against the 33 present and former reactor operators, the
first such civil penalties ever proposed for individual operators.
   The agency said the 33 fines ``involved sleeping and-or other
acts of inattention to duty'' at Philadelphia Electric Co.'s
dormant Peach Bottom plant on the Susquehanna River in Delta, Pa.

   July's hot weather cost Americans over a
quarter-billion dollars more than normal in keeping cool, the
government has reported.
   The national air conditioning bill for July was $4.3 billion,
some $255 million more than would have been expected in normal
weather, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said
Thursday.
   That averaged out to a July air conditioning bill of $104 for
the typical home, $6 more than normal.

   Five top officers of the investment group
Princeton-Newport Partners have pleaded innocent to racketeering
charges, and their lawyers criticized what they called a ``broad

   A sixth defendant was not present at Thursday's arraignment at
federal court in Manhattan, but his lawyer entered an innocent plea
for him.
   All six were named last week in a 35-count indictment on charges
of racketeering and conspiracy, the first time a racketeering
charge has been leveled against securities traders.

   Donnay SA rose to top seed among the
world's tennis racket makers when Bjorn Borg wielded its wares, but
as the Swedish champion's career faded, so did the company's
fortunes.
   People close to the Belgian company said Thursday that
family-owned Donnay's debts have mushroomed to $35 million, and
there is little hope of reaching an accord with creditors to avoid
bankruptcy.
   Donnay's creditors refuse to provide fresh capital unless the
company comes up with an acceptable restructuring plan.

<TEXT>
   Southwest Airlines has ordered 20 Boeing 737-300
jetliners, Boeing Commercial Airplanes said Thursday, giving the
unit of Boeing Co. a record for new commercial aircraft orders for
the fourth consecutive year.
   The Southwest order, worth about $560 million, brings the value
of announced orders so far in 1988 to $20.3 billion, bettering
1987's record of $19.9 billion.
   For 1988, 458 jet planes have been ordered, just three fewer
than 1978's record of 461. In 1987, 366 jets were ordered.
   The order by Dallas-based Southwest includes 12 of the
twin-engine jets to be delivered in June 1991, and eight previously
unannounced twinjets, three of which were delivered earlier this
year. The other five planes will be delivered starting in April
1989.
   The 737-300, which carries 137 passengers in Southwest's
configuration, has been Boeing's best seller, with 39 customers
ordering 790 planes. Orders for all 737 models total 2,186.

<HEAD>GM Raises Prices on 1989 Cars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. said Friday it will raise
prices of its 1989 automobiles an average of 2.9 percent because of
higher manufacturing costs.
   New prices announced by GM President Robert Stempel include
increases up to 4.6 percent for the redesigned, larger 1989
Cadillac Sedan DeVille, and more than 5 percent from current
discounted levels for the popular Chevrolet Corsica four-door sedan.
   Prices of some cars, including GM's most expensive, the $56,533
Cadillac Allante, and its least expensive, the $6,399 Pontiac
LeMans Coupe, will be unchanged, GM Comptroller John E. Rhame said.
   However, Stempel said, discounts on options have cut prices of
some models enough so that even with the increases, their 1989
introductory prices will be down from a year earlier.
   ``For example, the 1989 introductory prices for the Chevrolet
Corsica and Beretta, two of our most popular cars, are on average 4
percent to 5 percent lower than their comparably equipped
counterparts at 1988 introductory price levels,'' he said.
   Rhame said that as an example, the manufacturer's suggested
retail price at the start of the 1988 model year for a Corsica with
options including air conditioning, automatic transmission, tilt
wheel, tinted glass, rear window defogger and cruise control was
$11,618.
   With options discounts, the price of that car now would be
$10,618, he said. For 1989 it will be $11,168, a 5.2 percent
increase, but still down 3.9 percent from the 1988 introductory
level.
   The base price of the Cadillac Sedan DeVille will rise to
$25,435 from $23,404 for 1988, Rhame said.
   The high-volume Chevrolet Cavalier 4-door sedan will have a base
price of $8,595, up from $8,195, with the addition of rear-seat
shoulder belts as standard equipment for 1989, he said.
   Base prices will drop on some models, such as the Oldsmobile
Cutlass Calais two-door coupe, which will start at $9,995, down
from a 1988 base price of $10,320.
   GM's light truck prices will increase an average of 3 percent,
Rhame said, although specific truck prices were not released.
   Earlier this month, Ford Motor Co. announced price increases for
1989 ranging from 1.9 percent to 5.3 percent on six of its most
popular cars.
   Chrysler said in late July it will raise 1989 prices an average
of 3 percent, with increases up to 9 percent on some popular models
such as mini-vans.
