   The Pentagon inquiry into the shooting down of
an Iranian civilian jetliner on July 3 is reported to have found
that ``human error'' caused by the stress of first-time combat was
a factor in the USS Vincennes mistakenly shooting down the plane.
Here is a report on the conditions aboard U.S. warships in the
gulf.

   Inexperience, isolation and the need for
a constant state of high alert are factors that contribute to high
stress aboard the U.S. warships in the Persian Gulf.
   Just before the U.S. missile frigate Jack Williams sailed into
battle April 18, its skipper, Cmdr. Edward Mann, noted that only
two among the 225 men aboard had ever been in combat _ himself and
his senior chief petty officer.
   The statistic is not unusual for a U.S. warship in the Persian
Gulf, whose crews average about 23 years of age and usually include
a few 18-year-olds away from home for the first time.
   Navy officers say such factors as inexperience, the Persian
Gulf's oppressive heat, isolation at sea and the demands of staying
at high alert around the clock, add up to a ``high stress''
situation that can affect performance.
   Pentagon sources say the investigation of the July 3 shooting
down of an Iranian jetliner with 290 people aboard by the missile
cruiser Vincennes found ``human error,'' apparently caused by
stress in first-time combat, led radar operators to mistake the
A300 Airbus for a military attack plane.
   It was not the first time in Persian Gulf operations that radar
signals have been misinterpreted by radar operators.
   In an April 18 clash between U.S. and Iranian forces, the Jack
Williams' radar indicated it and two other warships were under
attack by Iranian Silkworm anti-ship missiles. The ships took
evasive maneuvers and launched anti-missile chaff.
   Gen. George B. Crist, commander of U.S. Central Command, later
said analysis of computer tapes showed no hostile missiles were
fired and the blips were the tracks of U.S. missiles and what the
Navy called ``hits on the system.''
   On Thursday, a Central Command spokesman, Maj. Barry Willey,
said that study found no ``human error, lack of training or
technical malfunction,'' and the ships' officers were justified in
assuming they were under attack.
   U.S. officials would not comment on a report that one of the
Jack Williams' ``Stinger'' anti-aircraft missile operators was
later sent home, suffering apparent psychological problems from his
first combat exposure. ``He just kind of choked,'' said a friend,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Navy's methods for dealing with stress begin with intensive
training, which officers say builds confidence, and includes other
means ranging from sports, exercise and recreational diversions to
personal counseling.
   U.S. officers readily concede that such efforts are not
foolproof.
   ``When a routine that's already full of tension suddenly becomes
something a lot bigger, with real danger, maybe shooting, you can't
predict how people are going to react, especially if they've never
done it before,'' said one officer.
   A key element in coping with stress is to assure sailors they
are not alone in facing pressure, said another officer.
   ``We emphasize togetherness, that everybody's part of a team _
the combat information team, the gunnery team, the flight team,
whatever. The better your relationships, the better you can
function in a situation.''
   Few ships promote a ``team'' concept as strenuously as the
Vincennes. ``Team 49,'' alluding to its hull number, appears on
bulletin boards, souvenirs and baseball caps, and is used by Capt.
Will C. Rogers III in addressing his crew.
   Skippers say their biggest concern is keeping crews in the high
state of constant readiness needed in the gulf, where short
distances require fast decisions.
   ``The hardest part of the mission is that you have to stay ready
24 hours a day. There's no time, really, to let your guard down,''
said Cmdr. Paul X. Rinn. Three weeks later, Rinn's ship, the
frigate Samuel B. Roberts, was nearly sunk when it hit an Iranian
mine.
   Shipboard tensions and boredom are relieved as much as possible
by recreational activities. Aboard the amphibious assault ship
Dubuque, the crew recently was treated to boxing matches and a rock
concert by a touring USO band.
   ``It's great way to let off steam,'' said a sailor after
defeating one of his buddies in the day's featured three-round
heavyweight match.
   Some U.S. ships have spent virtually all of their three-month
gulf tours escorting convoys or on patrol, and Crist said one
reason for deploying a multipurpose warship like the Vincennes was
to allow others more time in port.
   Many officers say the entire Navy was badly shaken by the
shooting down of the Iranian jetliner. However, they say it has not
caused any noticeable morale crisis, and the general view is that
in the same situation, most commanders would act just as Rogers did.
   ``Every C.O. has to call his best shot, based on the information
flow he gets at the time ... and live with that decision the rest
of his life. That's what command is all about,'' said the Dubuque's
skipper, Capt. Alex G. Balian, who won the Silver Star for valor in
Vietnam.
   The Navy traditionally relies on chaplains and doctors to
counsel those in need, with psychological guidance available in
extreme cases.
   Gulf-based Navy officers said no special stress counseling or
confidence-building programs have been set up in the aftermath of
the Vincennes affair. ``We don't have a morale problem,'' said one.
   Capt. W.D. Center, commander of the missile cruiser Reeves and a
friend of Vincennes' skipper Rogers, recalled that when the Airbus
was shot down, his ship was just two days out of home port in
Yokosuka, Japan, bound for the gulf.
   ``We talked about it, then we put it behind us. Everybody
understands that we have to get on with the job,'' he said.

Ghost</HEAD>

   Ghosts are fine, traditional
things to have around ancient English castles, but the Navy says
rumors of one stalking the depths of the aircraft carrier USS
Forrestal have spooked a few sailors.
   Flickering lights. Bumps in the night. Locked doors opening.
Voices on disconnected telephones. And a vanishing figure in a
khaki uniform. The figure's even got a nickname: George.
   At least that's what some of the men say aboard the Forrestal,
in its fourth month of a six-month deployment in the Indian Ocean
and the North Arabian Sea.
   They were interviewed by Lt. James E. Brooks, who detailed the
story of the ghost in a 12-page news release issued last month.
   The report about George hasn't ruffled any Navy feathers,
Mayport Navy spokesman Lt. Park Balevre said Thursday. ``I thought
it was cute. I think most people did.''
   ``What Lt. Brooks had in mind was a fluff piece to show the
lighter side of the Navy,'' said Balevre.
   But according to Brooks, some sailors don't think the ghost
story is at all cute.
   George lurks in two of the ship's below-the-waterline storage
areas, one of them a former morgue, spooked sailors claim.
   ``I've got one guy working for me now who refuses to go down
there alone. Our last chief petty officer in charge, who has since
transferred, refused to go down there at all,'' says Petty Officer
Daniel Balboa, in charge of the officers' mess.
   ``I've never seen any ghosts but you can hear weird things down
there,'' said Balboa.
   ``I was taking inventory one night and heard a noise like deck
grating being picked up and dropped,'' he recalled. ``I'd turn
around and look but didn't see anything. When I turned around to
begin my work again, the noise started again.''
   One night, Balboa said, he was checking temperatures in
food-storage freezers and kept finding open doors he had shut
behind him.
   ``It is impossible for anyone to open the reefer (refrigerator)
doors from the outside, behind me. To open them from the outside
requires a key since the doors lock automatically.
   ``I had the only key with me. That incident puts me on the verge
of believing,'' he said.
   Some say the ghost is a chief killed during a 1967 flight deck
fire that killed 137 sailors in the Gulf of Tonkin off the coast of
North Vietnam, Brooks wrote. Others guess he's a pilot whose body
was once stored on the ship.
   Petty Officer James Hillard hasn't ventured into the haunted
areas since he saw George last year while checking out odd
footsteps.
   ``He was wearing a khaki uniform, like an officer or chief would
wear,'' he says. He followed the apparition into a compartment but
``there was nobody in there, and I swear that is where he went,''
Hillard said.
   Mess Specialist 2nd Class Gary Weiss saw a khaki-clad ghost go
down a ladder to pump room No. 1. Whoever went down into the pump
room never came out and the ladder is the only access, he said.
   Hillard said he once was helping move supplies when a telephone
that was reportedly disconnected kept ringing.
   ``The phone rang and I answered it. This time there was a faint
voice calling, `Help! Help! I'm on the sixth deck!' Rumor had it
that a crew member was killed down there. I'm very scared to go
down there alone. If I do, I get out of there as fast as I can,''
Hillard said.
   Others are dubious.
   ``I think it's the guys' imagination,'' said Senior Chief Petty
Officer James Williams. ``I'm not superstitious but when I go down
there by myself, I find it uneasy. When that happens, your
imagination is going to play tricks on you.''

<HEAD>Fire Destroys Part of Reggie Jackson's Car Collection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A warehouse fire destroyed 35 cars owned
by Reggie Jackson, and the retired baseball slugger and classic
auto collector says he's ``hurting.''
   Jackson, who lives in nearby Oakland, was visibly upset Thursday
when he went to the warehouse, which was destroyed by fire
Wednesday night.
   He refused to be interviewed at his Berkeley auto dealership,
saying he was ``down'' and ``hurting'' about his loss.
   Thirty-five cars owned by Jackson were lost, including
Corvettes, Porsches, Mustangs and other ``high-value collector
cars,'' said fire department Capt. Ron Littley.
   The fire apparently started in a furniture store and spread to
the warehouse in the same cinderblock building, officials said. The
blaze raged out of control in the 33,000-square-foot warehouse in
an industrial area for more than an hour.
   ``Everything that was in there was gone,'' said fire Lt. David
Allen. The cause of the blaze was not immediately known.
   Jackson began his car collection in 1971 when he bought a 1940
Chevrolet for $300 and a color television. By last October, the
collection had grown to 97 vehicles. The rest of his collection was
stored elsewhere.
   Jackson retired last fall from the Oakland Athletics after a
stellar career that also included stints with the New York Yankees,
California Angels and Baltimore Orioles.

<HEAD>Dukakis Campaigns On Environment; Bush Continues Foreign Policy
Attacks</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: May be topped.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis is laying out his positions on environmental
issues during a tour of the West, just as a poll indicated that
region represents an untapped resource for Democrats. George Bush
invoked the names of Kennedy and Truman to show Dukakis has veered
``far outside the mainstream'' on foreign policy.
   As Bush tried to portray the Democratic presidential nominee as
occupying the liberal extreme, his own Republican party's right
wing was telling the vice president to avoid ``establishment blue
bloods'' when choosing a running mate.
   The warning from the Coalition for a Winning Ticket came as Gov.
George Deukmejian of California took himself out of consideration.
   In another campaign matter, Bush chief of staff Craig Fuller
confirmed Thursday that Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III would
leave his post and become campaign chief before the Aug. 15 start
of the Republican convention in New Orleans. Sources said the
announcement could come today.
   ``We don't have to make the false choice, the fool's choice,
between economic growth or environmental quality,'' Dukakis told
students at the University of California at Los Angeles, ``We can
have both, and in fact we must have both.''
   Dukakis' West Coast foray followed a trip into Mississippi, a
traditionally Democratic state that helped send President Reagan
and Richard Nixon to the White House. Dukakis lost the state to
Jesse Jackson in this year's Democratic primary.
   Dukakis spoke at the Neshoba County fair near where the bodies
of three slain civil rights workers were found 24 years ago
Thursday. Reagan campaigned at the fair in 1980 for his first term.
   Dukakis failed to mention the killings when addressing the
almost entirely white crowd, and referred only once to civil
rights. ``I talked about economic opportunity because that's the
most important single thing that concerns people,'' he explained.
   Bush, speaking to a Hispanic veterans group in Corpus Christi,
Texas, criticized Dukakis for his support for a nuclear freeze and
opposition to a new MX missile, the Midgetman missile and the
Reagan administration's proposed Star Wars nuclear defense system.
   ``His positions ... amount to a rejection of America's role as a
world leader and a repudiation of the Truman doctrine and the
vision of John Kennedy,'' Bush said, referring to bipartisan
foreign policy that evolved after World War II and focused on
containing communism.
   Dukakis, when asked whether he still supports a nuclear freeze,
said, ``Sure, and a comprehensive test ban treaty.''
   Later aboard his plane, Dukakis said he originally supported a
freeze ``because we wanted to stop the administration from
expanding the arsenal.''
   ``Now, it's turned around and we're talking about reduction. I'm
for reductions now,'' he said. ``I favor the development of certain
arms systems. I favor deep cuts in strategic weapons systems.''
   Bush also stabbed at the Democratic platform, calling it ``the
black hole of American politics.''
   ``Issues get sucked into it and lost, never to reappear again,''
he said.
   Bush later detoured to Chicago for the wake of a Polish-American
leader. It was his third such appearance this week in an ethnic
setting as the certain Republican nominee tries to keep Dukakis,
the multilingual son of immigrants, from winning that segment of
the population.
   Deukmejian said he took himself out of consideration because
Democrats would gain control of the Statehouse in California if he
dropped out. The Bush campaign said it accepted his decision.
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., who heads the conservative
coalition urging Bush to choose someone from the right, said
Thursday:
   ``The problem of the Bush campaign is that it is attracted to
establishment blue-bloods. What the Bush ticket needs is a
transfusion of red corpuscles from the conservative wing of our
party.''
   He said Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, Rep. Jack Kemp of New York
and Gov. John Sununu of New Hampshire would be acceptable.
   A recent analysis by The Gallup Organization seems to give the
Democratic ticket hope in formerly pro-Reagan Western states.
   The analysis said Western voters are optimistic about their own
financial future but dissatisfied with the general course of the
nation, and they don't find in Bush the anti-establishment leader
they found in Reagan.
   For example, ``traditionally anti-government voters in the Rocky
Mountains are now calling for more government action on social
issues than is the average American voter,'' wrote Andrew Kohut,
head of the Gallup organization.
   Kohut said the regional analyses he released were developed from
8,500 detailed interviews taken between May and July. The margin of
error is just under 2 percentage points. The analysis was done for
the Times-Mirror Co.

   Here is the 257-156 roll call Thursday by
which the House gave final congressional approval to legislation to
provide payments and an official government apology to
Japanese-Americans sent to internment camps during World War II.
   A ``yes'' vote is a vote in favor of the legislation.
   Voting yes were 185 Democrats and 72 Republicans.
   Voting no were 56 Democrats and 100 Republicans.
   X denotes those not voting.
   Present denotes those who voted they were ``present'' at the
time of the vote but did not vote ``yes'' or ``no'' on the issue.
   There are three vacancies in the 435-member House.

   Here is an example of the information the

   The figures are actual estimates for a 40-year-old ``John Q.

decades.

<HEAD>Administration Backs Tough Penalties for Medical Waste Dumpers</HEAD>

   The Environmental Protection Agency is backing
a congressional move to stiffen prison terms and fines for the kind
of medical waste dumping that has left coastlines from
Massachusetts to Maryland littered with syringes, dirty bandages
and other hospital refuse.
   Legislation drafted by Rep. William J. Hughes, D-N.J., would
make medical waste dumping at sea a federal crime punishable by up
to $250,000 in fines and five years in prison.
   A hauler dumping hospital debris less than three miles from
shore today could face up to 15 years in prison and $250,000 in
fines under the Clean Water Act, but violators outside the
three-mile limit would face a maximum of $50,000 in fines and one
year in prison under the applicable Marine Sanctuary Act.
   Hughes expressed concern that the current laws may not apply to
liquid medical waste or cover streams and other non-navigable
waters.
   ``It's clear that our existing state and federal laws dealing
with the handling and disposal of medical wastes are inadequate and
are not being properly enforced,'' Hughes said. ``It's equally
clear that time has come to treat this problem as a criminal
offense, not just a regulatory matter.''
   Hughes, chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on crime,
said he hoped the measure would act as a deterrent. And he said he
would consider adding one provision to allow federal agents to
claim the vessels and trucks used by illegal dumpers and a second
provision to extend coverage to land dumping.
   Bill Muszynski, deputy administrator of the Environmental
Protection Agency for the New York-New Jersey region, told the
subcommittee the agency supports the measure.
   ``Clearly, it is the feeling of most people that up to a year
(in prison) is insufficient,'' Muszynski said.
   Last year, the problem of medical waste washing up on beaches
was relegated to New Jersey shores. But in the past month, syringes
and other hospital debris have been reported extensively on New
York beaches and sporadically in Connecticut, Rhode Island and
Massachusetts. Late Wednesday, Maryland reported its first case of
medical waste.
   ``The sad fact is, there seems to be no scarcity of persons
willing to dump these wastes anywhere and everywhere in order to
avoid the cost of proper disposal or to reap the profits of
improper disposal procedures,'' Hughes said.
   The congressman said it costs hospitals $50 to $60 a ton for
disposal of non-infectious trash, but up to $2,000 a ton for ``red
bag'' materials that must be handled by private incineration
companies. An estimated 25 percent of the 150 million pounds of
waste produced annually by hospitals is considered infectious,
Hughes said.
   The Hughes bill was introduced Tuesday. On Wednesday, the Senate
passed a measure by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., that would
require a ``cradle-to-grave'' manifest system in New York, New
Jersey and Connecticut to help officials track medical waste.
   ``I can no more do my job in the area of environmental
protection and enforcement without such a law than I could
effectively attack organized crime without wiretaps and the latest
surveillance technology,'' New Jersey Attorney General Cary Edwards
said. ``It puts us back to the old gumshoe days.''
   Lautenberg and other lawmakers have attacked EPA officials for
failing to take action themselves. Muszynski said the agency does
not have the authority to create a pilot program especially for
three states.
   He added that the agency is considering a national manifest
system for medical waste.

<HEAD>Study Says Most Companies Do Little To Promote Voting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES HANNAH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The promotion of voting is not among the
priorities of many of America's companies even though the nation is
facing a voter participation ``crisis,'' a private group says.
   People for the American Way said Thursday that 60 percent of the
Fortune 500 companies surveyed conduct little or no organized
non-partisan voter registration, education or get-out-the-vote
activities.
   And only 6 percent have voter participation activities that
reach beyond their own employees, the group said.
   Ninety-one of the Fortune 500's top 100 corporations responded
to the group's phone and mail surveys, which were conducted in
April and May.
   Melanne Verveer, vice president of the group, said the nation is
facing the ``grim possibility'' that for the first time in its
history, less than half of the eligible voters will be going to the
polls in the presidential election.
   ``This crisis in participation is the result of a
three-decade-long slide in voter participation that threatens to
turn our government by all the people into government by less than
half the people,'' Ms. Verveer said.
   She said new institutions must take the lead to stem declining
voter participation and she noted that a few businesses have taken
exciting initiatives.
   Sherrod Brown, Ohio secretary of state, said many major
corporations in Ohio have printed up voter registration forms and
mailed them to customers as part of their monthly billing
procedures.
   ``We figure we will put literally millions of registration
forms, without government spending ... into prospective voters'
hands,'' Brown said.
   Bruce Akers, vice president of the Cleveland-based Ameritrust
Bank, said his company began offering voter registration services
in Cuyahoga County to its customers and the general public in 1982.
   ``As a result of our success and the fact that we've had such a
good response ... we're going to take this program to the 11 other
counties in Ohio where we have branches,'' Akers said.
   Nevertheless, Verveer said that ``the inescapable conclusion of
our study is that for the majority of corporations, voter
registration is nowhere to be found on their list of priorities.''
   The Washington-based People for the American Way is a
non-partisan constitutional liberties organization that conducts
public education programs on constitutional issues.

over price and the SBA agreed to contribute millions of dollars in

   President Daniel Ortega said the
leftist Sandinista government would crack down harder on the
domestic political opposition if the United States renews
assistance to the Contra rebels.
   Also Thursday, the foreign minister sent U.S. Secretary of State
George P. Shultz a note protesting a river boat ambush that the
government and witnesses blamed on the rebels.
   Shultz is touring Latin America this week and was in Brazil
today. In Uruguay on Thursday, he accused the Soviets of building
airstrips in Nicaragua, and called the Sandinistas a cancer that
the United States must cut out before it spreads.
   Aid to the Contras ran out in February, but Congress is
considering new money for the insurgents the United States has been
financing since 1981.
   The government and the rebels agreed to a cease-fire on March
23, and the government unilaterally extended the truce to the end
of August.
   Speaking at an electricity plant near Momotombo about 45 miles
northwest of Managua, Ortega warned that the government would ``cut
off the oxygen'' of the internal opposition and begin fighting the
Contras again if a U.S. aid package is approved.
   In Washington, the White House on Thursday rejected a $27
million Senate Democratic proposal for humanitarian aid to the
rebels but said Congress and the Reagan administration could still
work out a compromise.
   ``Yankee pressure is not going to make the Sandinistas more
flexible,'' Orega said. ``Yankee pressure is going to toughen the
Sandinistas.''
   The government jailed more than 30 opposition figures and
cracked down on opposition media after police broke up a large
anti-government rally on July 10. It expelled U.S. Ambassador
Richard Melton and seven other American diplomats, and Washington
responded by expelling eight Nicaraguan diplomats.
   In a note dated Wednesday, Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto
reminded Shultz that Tuesday's boat attack, which killed two people
and wounded at least 24, was carried out ``a few hours from your
stop in the region.''
   ``Your visit to Central America once again has helped encourage
the war and the state terrorism that your country practices against
Nicaragua, in flagrant violation of the norms and principles of
international law,'' D'Escoto wrote.
   The note was read to The Associated Press by an official at the
Foreign Ministry.
   Radio Liberacion, the rebels' station, blamed the attack on the
Sandinistas. They called it a staged ``attack on themselves''
intended to dissuade the U.S. Congress from approving new aid for
the rebels.
   The Defense Ministry said the boat was hit by rifle and mortar
fire about 150 mile southeast of Managua on the Escondido River, a
major military supply route of the government. About 200
Nicaraguans and 10 Americans were on the boat, and an American, an
Italian and a Costa Rican were among the injured.
   The Rev. Lucius Walker of Demarest, N.J., who was grazed in the
buttocks by a bullet in the attack, said Wednesday the U.S.
government was responsible for terrorism because of its financial
support for the rebels.

   The Palestinian uprising, election year
politics and protracted labor disputes are undermining Israel's
economic recovery program by pushing up inflation and reducing
growth.
   Industrial production is down 3.5 percent, the first such drop
in eight years, and inflation is expected to exceed 20 percent, up
from 16 percent last year and a third higher than initially
forecast.
   ``We had to scale down our expectations'' after more optimistic
projections in early 1988, said Ruth Lowental, assistant director
general of economic affairs in the Finance Ministry.
   The gloomier prognosis is accompanied by a ``feeling of
insecurity because nobody knows what's going to happen after the
(Nov. 1 national) election,'' said Joseph Canaan, an Israeli
journalist who writes for two West German economic publications.
   A key reason for the slump is the 8-month-old Arab uprising in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip already has eaten up more
than half of this year's growth, initially projected at 3.7 percent.
   The uprising has cost more than $700 million in lost tourism,
uncollected taxes and additional military expenses, said Amnon
Neubach, an economic adviser to Foreign Minister Shimon Peres.
   In addition, fewer of the 1.5 million Palestinians in the
occupied lands buy Israeli products and about 20 percent of the
110,000 Palestinians working in Israel no longer report to their
jobs as a result of a Palestinian boycott.
   ``When you have 1.5 million consumers who used to buy Israeli
products, and they stopped doing it, it has a serious effect,''
said an Israeli industrialist, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Stability is also threatened by increasing wage demands, backed
by numerous strikes by Israeli workers. Excluding Palestinian work
stoppages, the Israeli economy lost 1.3 million work days due to
strikes in 1987, more than triple the 1986 figure.
   The labor disputes indicate workers are no longer willing to
make the kind of sacrifices they accepted during a 1985 austerity
program.
   Workers then accepted wage cuts of up to 20 percent to help stem
soaring inflation and reduce a $3 billion budget deficit.
   The program worked. Inflation dropped to 16.1 percent in 1987,
and the budget deficit fell from 13.6 percent of the Gross Domestic
Product of 1.2 billion shekels in 1984 to a surplus of 1.7 percent
of the 1986 GDP of 1.3 billion shekels ($812 million).
   But in the past two years, real wages have been rising faster
than productivity, heating up inflation. And Finance Minister Moshe
Nissim is under growing pressure to make concessions as the
election campaign is heating up.
   ``Our basic target is to maintain stability,'' Ms. Lowental
said. ``But nobody knows what's going to happen with the wages.''
   Still unsigned is a tentative agreement for an 11 percent wage
increase over two years for the 450,000 civil servants, one-third
of the civilian labor force. Also unresolved are private sector
negotzed
national health system with months of strikes and slowdowns.
   The government agreed to emergency payments to ease the backlog
of 15,000 Israelis waiting for operations, but there has been
little progress in wage talks for doctors who earn an average $700
a month and are seeking wage hikes of more than 20 percent.
   If the doctors get large increases, ``it could affect the whole
wage structure. If you give higher wages to one group of people,
you have to give more to all the others,'' said Canaan.
   Nissim also is under pressure to devalue the Israeli shekel
which has been fixed at a rate of about 1.6 shekels to the dollar
since the days of hyperinflation.
   Manufacturers complain the strong shekel is making it difficult
for Israeli exports to compete and is partly to blame for the drop
in industrial production.
   Nissim has refused to devalue for fear of raising import prices
and fueling inflation.
   Especially hard hit is Koor, the industrial conglomerate of the
powerful Histadrut Trade Union Federation, which lost $250 million
in 1987, a record in Israeli industry.
   The United States, which gives Israel $1.2 billion a year in
economic aid, urged Israel to sell off state-owned companies, lower
taxes and cut government spending.
   The government has taken some steps in that direction. But Chaim
Barkai, economics professor at Hebrew University, said no unpopular
steps would be taken during the three-month election campaign.
   ``The government must close down unprofitable factories and cut
spending. But there won't be any changes in economic policy before
the elections,'' Barkai said.

   Iran and Iraq would simultaneously halt
their bloodshed and begin peace talks under a compromise solution
proposed by the U.N. chief, but sources say Iraq is cool to the
idea.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar received a report
Thursday from a U.N. military team that visited both nations on
arrangements for a U.N.-supervised cease-fire. The contents were
not disclosed, but the U.N. chief said he would make a report to
the Security Council today.
   Perez de Cuellar has been trying to resolve a standoff between
the two nations over the timing of a truce and the start of
cease-fire talks in their 8-year-old war.
   ``I think both parties are interested in a peaceful solution ..
. The concept of direct talks is accepted by both sides and the
matter is when (they will take place). That is something on which I
am working,'' he said Thursday.
   The issue of face-to-face talks between the bitter enemies has
complicated the talks on implementing a truce and a U.N. peace
plan. Iraq demands that direct talks be held before a cease-fire
and Iran says they can begin only after a truce.
   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Perez de Cuellar has proposed to both sides that he announce a
cease-fire date and simultaneously invite both sides to hold direct
talks on a comprehensive peace treaty.
   The sources say the talks and a truce could begin the same day,
perhaps in a week if both sides are agreeable.
   Iraq also is asking that the five permanent members of the
Security Council guarantee the truce and other elements of a peace
plan. The five _ United States, Soviet Union, China, Britain and
France _ are considering the issue, the sources said.
   Perez de Cuellar did not spell out his proposals for reporters
and said he has not yet received a formal response from Iraq.
   Diplomatic sources say Baghdad is not enthusiastic about the
idea, but stopped short of outright rejection of the proposed
simultaneous announcement.
   Perez de Cuellar said Iran's response, although not formal, has
been ``constructive.''
   ``Unfortunately, from the Iraqi side, I have not received the
comments which I have asked for,'' Perez de Cuellar told reporters
as he left U.N. headquarters.
   Meanwhile, the official Iraqi News Agency said in a dispatch
from the United Nations that Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz, who
heads Iraq's negotiating team, met Thursday with the U.S. envoy to
the U.N., Ambassador Vernon Walters, and visiting Indian Foreign
Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao.
   The agency said the men discussed the cease-fire resolution and
other issues, but gave no other details.
   Perez de Cuellar said that next week, probably Wednesday, he
would deliver a comprehensive report to the council on the
cease-fire declaration, troop withdrawal, prisoner exchange and
other elements of a U.N. peace plan.
   Iran and Iraq have waged war since 1980, when Iraq invaded
Iranian territory. The death toll is estimated at 1 million.
   The Security Council in July 1987 adopted a resolution calling
for a cease-fire in the war, which has prompted an escalated U.S.
naval presence in the gulf.
   Iraq accepted the proposal, but it was not until last month that
Iran, after a series of battlefield defeats, said it, too, would
accept the resolution. Since then, Iraq has launched several
attacks on Iran to bolster its bargaining position.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati met the U.N. chief
for more than one hour Thursday. The Iranian envoy made no comments
as he left the meeting.
   Iraq says it needs the direct talks as a guarantee of sincerity
from Iran, which it fears will seek only a temporary truce to
regroup forces.

   Michael Jackson is so popular here
that the government has decided he cannot come for a concert in
December, an official said today.
   Syed Zainal Abidin, secretary general of the Welfare Ministry,
told reporters the Cabinet decided recently the concert could not
be held because it would be too difficult to control the crowd.
   He said the ministry had wanted the American singer to perform
here to raise money for the Welfare Fund, from which money is given
out periodically to orphanages and charities.
   The ministry will appeal to the Cabinet to reconsider its
decision, he added.

craft that uses only one horse power.
   Ms. Yeager has taken up amateur harness racing.
   ``I like trying things that are new, and this is very
exciting,'' said the 36-year-old woman, who went from the cockpit
to the sulky after her record-breaking round-the-world flight with
Voyager co-pilot Dick Rutan.
   Ms. Yeager, who at 5-foot-4 and 100 pounds is about the right

   She first participated in a celebrity harness race in April, and
has since competed in a number of races as part of the Billings

   ``Godfather of Soul'' James Brown was admitted to
a hospital for oral surgery today to mend bone damage in his lower
jaw, a spokeswoman said.
   The 2{-hour operation was necessary because the 55-year-old
singer has suffered degeneration of his jawbone, said Debra Bloom,
a spokeswoman for Crawford Long Hospital.
   In the procedure, an impression will be made of the singer's
lower jaw. An artificial support made from the impression will be
implanted when Brown returns to the hospital in three to four
weeks, Ms. Bloom said.
   Brown was accompanied to the hospital by his wife, Adrienne,
with whom he has recently been involved in a much-publicized series
of domestic problems.
   A South Carolina judge recently ordered him to perform a benefit
concert as part of a probated sentence for drug and weapons charges
stemming from the marital disputes.

   Greyhound bus driver Jerry Knick says
being picked to take the wheel of football color commentator John
Madden's 40-foot-long, customized ``Maddencruiser'' has left him
``kind of numb.''
   ``It's still all a shock,'' Knick said from Oakland, Calif.,
where he was chosen Wednesday from among 10 Greyhound drivers to be
Madden's chauffeur during the pro football season. ``I don't know
what to expect.''
   Madden, a color commentator for CBS-TV, says he's afraid to fly

spokeswoman Kristi Neal.
   For Knick, a 36-year-old Woodbridge man with a spotless 15-year
record with Greyhound, the selection process included an interview

   ``I walked into his bus and he was sitting there in a big chair

   Secretary of State George Shultz brought
his Latin American tour to Brazil after accusing the Soviet Union
of building airstrips in Nicaragua that threaten the United States.
   Shultz arrived in the Brazilian capital Thursday night after a
half-day visit to Uruguay, where he portrayed the leftist
government in Nicaragua as a ``cancer'' in Central America.
   ``Nicaragua is a threat to the United States, not for what it
might do, but because of the power of the Soviets who are building
airstrips there which could pose a problem,'' he told a news
conference in Montevideo, the Uruguayan capital.
   ``There exists a cancer which we have to cut out and we are
going to do everything possible to stop its growth,'' the secretary
added.
   Shultz did not elaborate on the airstrips. The Reagan
administration repeatedly has ripped the pro-Soviet government in
Nicaragua and accused the Soviets of building airstrips there.
   Hundreds of students and workers from leftist and union
organizations marched in downtown Montevideo near the Foreign
Ministry to protest Shultz's visit. No incidents were reported.
   Nicaragua is again expected to be on the agenda during talks in
Brazil, where Shultz planned to meet today with Foreign Minister
Roberto de Abreu Sodre and President Jose Sarney.
   Much of his visit is to focus on trade policy, a touchy topic
here. Last month, the Washington announced its intention to impose
sanctions on $200 million worth of Brazilian exports because this
country refuses to recognize patents on U.S. drugs.
   The Brazil stop is the fourth on Shultz' nine-nation Latin
American tour.
   Shultz began in Guatemala on Monday, where he failed to obtain a
clear condemnation of Nicaragua and its Sandinista government.
   Instead, Shultz and four Central American foreign ministers
signed a declaration that called for ``peace, democracy, security,
social justice and economic development'' in the region.
   In Uruguay, Shultz issued yet another harsh denunciation of the
Sandinistas, who are fighting the U.S.-supported Contra rebels
trying to overthrow the government.
   Uruguay backs efforts of the Contadora Group _ comprised of
Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela and Panama _ for a peaceful solution to
the conflict in Nicaragua.
   Shultz presented the U.S. position in talks with President Julio
Maria Sanguinetti and Foreign Minister Luis Barrios Tassano. The
Uruguayan leaders issued no statement after the private meetings.
   ``We talked about many things and we are not necessarily in
agreement in every case, but I can say, and the president
(Sanguinetti) will be in agreement with me ... our relations are
excellent,'' Shultz said later.
   Socialist Deputy Jose Diaz said Shultz arrived with the
intention of ``pressuring'' Uruguay to adopt the U.S. position of
diplomatically isolating Nicaragua.
   ``We will reaffirm to Shultz the necessity to respect nations'
right to self-determination, and we will keep searching for a Latin
American solution to a problem that is Latin American,'' Diaz said.
   The communist daily La Hora put Shultz's picture on page one and
stamped on top of it, ``Undesirable.''
   Shultz planned to spend the weekend in Rio de Janeiro, 750 miles
southeast of Brasilia, playing golf and holding private meetings.
On Monday he leaves for Bolivia.
   The purpose of Shultz's 10-day tour was to renew acquaintances
with friends and allies of the United States and call attention to
Latin America's returning democracies. Sanguinetti's March 1985
inauguration ended nearly 12 years of military rule.
   As he did in Argentina, Shultz met with key opposition leaders
as well as government figures.

<HEAD>Economists Expect Unemployment Rate To Stabilize</HEAD>

July</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   With youths fully absorbed into the summer job
market, economists are looking to the nation's unemployment rate to
stabilize after a couple of months of large fluctuations.
   On the eve of today's release of labor market figures for July,
most economists expected the rate either to remain at its
14-year-low 5.3 percent in June or to rise a tenth of a percentage
point with an employment increase of 150,000 to 200,000.
   The jobless rate had bounced like a roller coaster from 5.6
percent in March, down to 5.4 percent in April and back up to 5.6
percent in May before the June decline.
   Both private analysts and economists for the Bureau of Labor
Statistics said the monthly fluctuations were due primarily to two
factors:
   One factor is the adjustments the government makes with the May
and June figures to account for the out-of-school youths flooding
the job market.
   The other factor is the calendar. The survey of 55,800
households upon which the rate is calculated is always taken on the
12th day of the month. Because the 12th occurred in the second week
of May but the third week in June, economists said the real rate of
joblessness was probably lower than what was reported in May and
higher than the June figure.
   ``I think there will be an uptick to 5.4 percent for July,''
said Allen Sinai, chief economist of The Boston Co. ``But I
wouldn't consider that as indicative of any new trend or a
weakening of the economy.''
   Payroll growth soared in June with 345,000 new jobs, compared
with average monthly increases of 250,000 from January through May.
After slowing down in the spring, factory and construction
employment also resumed their upward paths in June.
   The Labor Department reported Thursday that new claims for
unemployment insurance _ seasonally adjusted _ jumped by 51,000 in
the third week of July to 371,000, the highest since last January.
   ``If the unemployment claims are rising that rapidly, then new
job creation may be a little skinny in July,'' said Michael Evans,
a private Washington economist who also expected the rate of
joblessness to rise to 5.4 percent.
   However, other analysts attributed the increase in applications
for unemployment benefits to temporary layoffs in the auto industry
as manufacturers retooled their assembly lines for the 1989 models.
   Meanwhile, fears that continuous months of unemployment rates in
the range of 5.3 percent to 5.7 percent might trigger wage
inflation so far appear unfounded.
   Although employers in tight job market areas along the East
Coast and in California are finding they have to pay much more than
the minimum wage to attract workers for entry-level jobs, pay
increases in general are still below inflation.
   Hourly wages actually fell 2 cents an hour in June to a
seasonally adjusted $9.27, according to the Labor Department.
   ``Real wage rates have not yet recovered from a decade of price
shocks and slow economic growth,'' said Wendy Rayack, a Wesleyan
University economist. ``They are still nearly 7 percent below their
1978 level.''

   Congressional Democrats are trying again to
fashion a Pentagon bill that President Reagan would sign in the
wake of his rejection of their first attempt to write a defense
budget.
   The Democratic-controlled Senate was scheduled today to return
to work on a bill appropriating money for the Pentagon in the
fiscal year starting Oct. 1.
   Reagan vetoed an earlier Pentagon budget bill because he
objected to its reductions in his request for Star Wars
anti-missile spending and Democratic-added arms control policy
restrictions he opposes.
   When he vetoed the bill Wednesday, Reagan indicated he might be
able to accept the appropriations measure, which contains the same
cuts in spending for the Strategic Defense Initiative, as Star Wars
is formally known, but none of the arms control limitations.
   However, those restrictions could be added as the Senate tries
to finish work on the bill befores its adjourns next week for a
summer recess that won't end until after Labor Day.
   The Senate also may add to the bill a proposal to send new
humanitarian aid to Nicaragua's Contra rebels, but to restrict
sharply the possibility of future military help. Reagan is seeking
a package that includes immediate military aid.
   Reagan vetoed the bill which authorized the Pentagon budget.
That measure is the first half of the two-step congressional budget
process which also includes an appropriations bill that has money
to pay for programs in the earlier authorization measure.
   Although the vetoed measure authorized $299.5 billion worth of
Pentagon spending and the appropriations bill proposes $282
billion, the legislation is essentially the same. Dollar totals in
authorization bills generally are higher because they cover more
projects in future years.
   When the Senate finishes work on the appropriations bill, it
will go to a House-Senate conference committee to be reconciled
with separate legislation enacted by the House six weeks ago.
   Senate Democratic leaders are considering adding the vetoed bill
as an amendment to the appropriation measure, which could force
another showdown with Reagan.
   Democrats have decided not to attempt to override the veto,
because they couldn't muster the two-thirds vote needed in each
chamber.
   Reagan had sought $4.8 billion for Star Wars next year, compared
with the program's current budget of $3.9 billion. The vetoed bill
would have cut his request to $4 billion and added other
restrictions on what type of anti-missile systems could be
developed.
   The appropriations bill contains $3.7 billion for Star Wars, and
a separate appropriation measure for the Energy Department included
another $300 million for related research. That would bring the
total for next year to the $4 billion level rejected by Reagan.
   The bill also contains a 4.3 percent pay raise for the nation's
2.1 million uniformed military personnel.
   Conservatives have praised Reagan's veto, saying it could
energize the presidential candidacy of Vice President George Bush.
   Reagan met Thursday with some of his conservative backers,
including former Sen. John Tower, a Texas Republican who once
chaired the Senate Armed Services Comittee.
   ``I think the president having vetoed the bill and having drawn
the issue clearly is going to make it more politically perilous for
the Democratic majority in Congress to repeat the bad legislation
that appeared in this bill,'' Tower said after the meeting.
   Richard Perle, former assistant secretary of defense and now a
fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said, ``The key issue
was the future of SDI. This is not a dispute over details or
precise funding levels. The action taken by Congress ... was
intended to kill the program without taking political
responsibility.''
   Kenneth Adelman, former head of the Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency, called the veto ``the start of the issue-focused Bush
campaign and the staving off of creeping lame duckism for the
Reagan administration.''

   Republican George Bush, ending a week of sharp
foreign policy attacks on Michael Dukakis, was heading for his
oceanside retreat in Maine to film campaign commercials and
continue pondering his choice for a running mate _ with his list
one name shorter.
   California Gov. George Deukmejian asked Thursday to be withdrawn
from consideration, and the vice president's chief of staff, Craig
Fuller, indicated the governor's wishes would be honored.
   ``He's going to be very important to us in winning California,''
Fuller said. Asked if that was the final word, Fuller said, ``Yes.''
   Bush campaign aides previously had said Deukmejian was among
about a dozen people Bush had told were under active consideration.
   ``As you know, if I were to assume the vice presidency, it would
mean turning the entire executive branch of the nation's most
populous state over to the Democratic Party,'' Deukmejian said in
his letter to Bush.
   California's lieutenant governor and the next four officials in
line for succession are Democrats.
   The vice president has said he will make up his mind on a
running mate before he leaves for the Republican National
Convention, where he will be installed formally as the GOP
presidential nominee.
   However, he has vowed to keep his choice secret until late in
the four-day August 15-18 convention.
   The vice president was traveling later today to his family
vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine, where he was to spend the
weekend.
   All five of Bush's adult children and many of his grandchildren
were to be with him for the making of campaign films that will
focus on Bush's family life, aides said.
   However, Bush delayed his departure until later today, possibly
for the long-expected announcement that Treasury Secretary James A.
Baker III will resign his post to take over as Bush's campaign
chairman.
   Bush aides Thursday confimed that such an announcement was
imminent. There has been wide speculation that Baker would make the
announcement today at the close of financial markets.
   President Reagan is expected to name New York investment banker
Nicholas Brady _ a close friend of Bush's _ to fill out the rest of
Baker's term.
   Bush told reporters on Air Force 2 that he also will be working
on his convention acceptance speech in the days ahead.
   ``We're going to go over the left field fence'' with the speech,
Bush said.
   Bush, who has been focusing on defense and foreign policy issues
all week, told a Hispanic veterans group in Corpus Christi, Texas,
on Thursday that foreign policy stands taken by Dukakis, the
Democratic presidential nominee, would amount to ``unilateral
disarmament.''
   ``All my experience tells me that the governor of Massachusetts'
views, if implemented, would make the world not a safer place, but
more dangerous,'' he told the G.I. Forum.
   He said Dukakis had ``veered far outside the mainstream''
bipartisan consensus formed after World War II to confront
communist threats to ``free people'' worldwide.
   ``His positions ... amount to a rejection of America's role as a
world leader and a repudiation of the Truman doctrine and the
vision of John Kennedy,'' Bush said.
   He cited Dukakis' support for a nuclear freeze and opposition to
advanced weapons systems favored by the Reagan administration.
   Bush said the Democratic platform is ``no help'' in trying to
determine where the Democratic presidential nominee stood on
foreign-policy issues.
   ``The Democratic platform is the black hole of American
politics,'' Bush said. ``Issues get sucked into it and lost, never
to reappear again.''
   After leaving Corpus Christi, Bush made an unscheduled visit to
Chicago to attend a wake for Aloysius Mazewski, who had been
president of the National Polish Alliance.
   Majewski, whom Bush described as a friend of long standing and
``a great Polish-American leader,'' died Wednesday of a heart
attack.

<HEAD>Young Pilot Faces West German Charges For Buzzing Kremlin</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mathias Rust, facing possible criminal
charges in West Germany for flying an airplane to Moscow's Red
Square, is getting less than a hero's welcome in his homeland after
he was freed from a Soviet prison.
   The 20-year-old Rust was in seclusion on Thursday, the day after
the Kremlin cut short his four-year prison term he received for
buzzing the Kremlin spires on May 28, 1987.
   He said in a brief television interview from Hanover that he was
glad to be home after more than 14 months in prison.But he also
faces two investigations, one of them by licensing officials in
Hamburg.
   ``We are now investigating whether he is trustworthy enough to
be flying. That's the question,'' spokesman Wolfgang Heidenreich
told The Associated Press by telephone from Hamburg. ``He still has
the right to be heard, so no final decision has been made.''
   A suspension of the license also is possible, Heidenreich said,
but declined to predict the outcome of the investigation.
   In the northern town of Itzehoe, prosecutor Rolf Schamerowski
said he was looking into possible criminal charges of fraud and
endangering air traffic.
   The possiblility of a fraud charge stems from Rust's misstating
his destination when he checked out his flying club's single-engine
Cessna and took off on a one-day jaunt to Moscow.
   ``We'll have to wait for the questioning of Rust to see how the
investigation proceeds,'' Schamerowski told reporters Thursday.
``Only after the end of the investigation will it be clear whether
there will be any sanctions against him in the federal republic
(West Germany).''
   Schamerowski's jurisdiction includes Wedel, the Rust family's
hometown, six miles west of Hamburg. Rust got his pilot's license
from Hamburg state.
   The aircraft is owned by the Hamburg Aero-Club, where Rust is
still a member. In addition to facing possible federal charges,
Rust may have to pay Aero-Club an unspecified amount for
maintenance costs on the aircraft.
   Spokesman Helmut Gass also predicted Rust will resign from the
Aero-Club, because of members' ``negative feelings'' about the
famous pilot.
   Rust repeated the reasons for his flight in a brief interview
with the Norddeutsche Rundfunk radio and television network of
Hamburg.
   ``The motives were, as I've always said, to improve relations
between our countries with this flight, with my existence, with the
landing _ and to further the cause of peace in general,'' Rust
said. ``That was the goal.''
   But a poll by the Bild newspaper indicates that most West
Germans do not approve of his daredevil act.
   The newspaper said that in its poll of 1,009 people, only 4
percent said they consider Rust a ``hero,'' 60 percent saw his
flight as ``criminal mischief,'' 7 percent as a ``serious crime,''
and the remainder as a ``dumb act attributable to youth.''
   Fifty-two percent of those polled thought Rust should
permanently lose his pilot's license, Bild said in a telex to other
news organizations.

   President George Vassiliou of Cyprus said
Thursday that both U.S. presidential candidates have ``clearly
indicated'' they want to heighten American involvement in seeking
an end to the Greek-Turkish division of his nation.
   ``Both of them (Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael
Dukakis) have shown an increased interest in the Cyprus issue and
have clearly indicated that they would like a more active role
played by the United States,'' Vassiliou said.
   Dukakis' campaign reportedly has received strong financial
support from the Greek-American community which has been calling
for a withdrawal of the Turkish forces which have occupied Cyprus
since 1974.
   Asked whether he thought Dukakis or Bush would play a more
active role in seeking a solution to the Cyprus problem, Vassiliou
noted the strong support he perceived on both sides, saying ``I
want a bipartisan policy on Cyprus.''
   ``I have had a very fruitful and intensive visit to
Washington,'' he told reporters about his four day days of talks
with President Reagan, Bush, Dukakis and other U.S. officials.
   Vassiliou said he expected the Reagan administration to work for
a solution in its remaining months in office _ ``there is no reason
why we should lose time because of the elections.''
   He said he found strong U.S. support for his Aug. 24 talks in
New York with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash under the
auspices of U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar.

   Both houses of Congress are expected to act
next week on a $3.9 billion drought aid compromise calling for a
three-month dairy price-support increase but limiting feed
assistance for livestock producers.
   ``The bill we have completed seeks to ensure the future for our
farmers and ranchers,'' Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman
Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., said Thursday night after a conference
committee agreed to the measure.
   House Agriculture Committee Chairman E. ``Kika'' de la Garza,
D-Texas, said floor action would come Thursday at the latest but
that he would try for accelerated handling and final approval
Monday or Tuesday.
   Fast action also was expected in the Senate. Farm lawmakers in
both houses were forecasting overwhelming approval for the
election-year measure.
   President Reagan was expected to sign the bill. Its $3.9 billion
price tag represents a steep cut from levels at which
administration budget officials said lawmakers would start to flirt
with nasty fiscal repercussions.
   At the core of the measure is a feature that would pay farmers
with 65 percent of lost earnings beyond 35 percent of the expected
harvest.
   Larger payments would be available for farmers very severely
hurt by the fierce heat and shortage of rainfall plaguing the
nation's heartland.
   The bill would furnish such producers with 90 percent of losses
over 75 percent of their expected harvest. It represented a
compromise between the 95 percent level the House approved and the
85 percent passed by the Senate.
   Conferees fenced verbally without agreeing on much in sessions
Thursday morning and early afternoon. Leahy and de la Garza finally
went behind closed doors with top Republican members of the
conference committee.
   They emerged Thursday night with a compromise that was swiftly
agreed to by other members of the conference committee.
   The compromise jettisoned a Senate-passed provision that would
provide government feed assistance to farmers who would not
ordinarily be producing their own feed even if not for the drought.
Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said Wednesday he would be
reluctant to recommend the feature to Reagan because the price tag
was $2 billion.
   Instead, the conferees opted for a House-passed provision that
would provide assistance to livestock producers who also produce
their own feed. The price tag would be $800 million by
administration estimate.
   Livestock feed has become a key to the drought issue. Heat and a
lack of rain have scorched a substantial quantity of hay and feed
grains in the midcontinent, causing feed prices to shoot up.
   Retained by the compromise was the one major dispute that the
conferees had resolved earlier: a House provision that would raise
the dairy price-support level in April through June next year by 50
cents to $11.10 for each 100 pounds of milk.
   Leahy voted ``aye'' to the dairy plan while all of the other
Senate conferees remained silent. The Senate chairman's home state
is a major source of the East Coast's milk supply.
   ``The Senate recedes to the House by one weak aye,'' de la Garza
chortled.
   Major modifications were made by conferees in a Senate-approved
provision that would constitute a major benefit for American
manufacturers of ethanol _ ethyl alcohol made from farm products
and mixed with gasoline to form the fuel gasohol.
   The Senate's plan would have allowed ethanol makers to buy 2
million bushels each of surplus corn, or other crops, each month at
110 percent of the goverment-owned Commodity Credit Corp.'s
acquisition price _ well below current, drought-inflated prices.
The total available would have been limited to 16 million bushels a
month.
   It was described by proponents as a move to boost a number of
small ethanol manufacturers, but it also could have turned into a
sizable subsidy for the Archer Daniels Midland Co. of Decatur,
Ill., a major corporation with a politically active management.
   As reshaped by the conference committee, the program's fate
would be left up to the secretary of agriculture. ``I don't think
it will be put into effect,'' said Rep. Edward R. Madigan, R-Ill.,
the ranking House Agriculture Committee Republican.
   Ethanol producers that use more than 30 million bushels of corn
a year would be excluded from the program.
   The conference committee adopted House provisions that would
make disaster payments available to farmers hit by disasters other
than the drought, including some that happened in 1987. The
payments would be for ``drought, hail, excessive moisture or
related condition.''
   De la Garza said the related condition ``includes hurricanes,
because they come with moisture.'' The hail payments were designed
to compensate cotton growers in the district of Rep. Larry Combest,
R-Texas, where a severe storm hammered the crop last year.
   Administration officials had opposed going beyond payments to
drought victims.
   The two houses compromised on a House requirement that farmers
would have to buy federal crop insurance in 1989 and 1990 to
receive disaster payments. Under the legislation, they would have
to buy one year of the insurance if their disaster loss exceeded 65
percent of normal yield.

   The Soviets hope to develop an atomic-powered
rocket engine to provide the propulsion for a manned mission to
Mars early in the 21th century, a Russian scientist said Thursday.
   Vasiliy I. Moroz of the Soviet Space Research Institute said
experts in his nation believe that ``a new type of rocket'' will
have to be developed to make a planned 1{-year voyage to and from
Mars.
   Moroz said Soviet engineers are working on an
``atomic-electric'' rocket engine that would be used to accelerate
a Mars explorer craft once it has been boosted into Earth orbit.
   The Soviet scientist, speaking at a news conference at the 20th
general assembly of the International Astronomical Union, declined
to give any details on the atomic-electric rocket, but he said none
of the current chemical rockets used by the Soviets is large enough
for a Mars mission.
   Included in the Soviet fleet of launch rockets is the Energia,
the world's largest, but Moroz said even it is not powerful enough.
   American space scientists long have recognized the need to
develop propulsion systems that did not depend upon the chemical
reaction of fuel and oxidizer. The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration has conducted some research on electric and ion
drive rockets, but the project has never been received money for
development.
   Moroz said the Soviets are giving the exploration of Mars a high
priority. Two Soviets probes to Phobos, a moon of Mars, were
launched last month.
   In 1994, he said, the Soviets will send an unmanned craft to
Mars carrying a robot rover that would explore hundreds of miles on
the planet's surface. The rover also would take drill samples and
measurements of the atmosphere.
   The next stage of the program, Moroz said, is testing in space
new technical elements needed for a manned mission, including the
atomic-electric rocket and a rocket to return to orbit from the
Mars surface. The Soviets also plan a robot craft that would land
on Mars, collect soil samples and then return them to Earth.
   A manned Martian mission could be mounted by the year 2005 or
2010, Moroz said. Preliminary plans call for a six-member crew to
make the voyage in a two-stage craft that would be assembled in
Earth orbit, he said.
   Although the Soviets have gathered a great amount of information
about the de-conditioning effects on the human body of longterm
space flight, Moroz said the Mars mission may use artificial
gravity to keep the crew members healthy.
   Both American and Soviet studies have shown that long exposure
to the weightlessness of space causes the heart to weaken and the
body to lose bone mass.
   Moroz said the Soviets hope that American scientists and
astronauts will take part in the Mars mission, but even without
U.S. participation, the Soviets are determined to explore the red
planet.
   Mars has been only partially explored by the American Viking
spacecraft, he said, adding: ``It is our impression that it is time
to return to Mars.''
   Soviet scientists want to search for traces of liquid water on
the Martian surface and still hold out hope that there may be life,
even though Viking found no traces, Moroz said.
   ``You can't give guarantees that life in some form doesn't exist
there now, despite the negative findings of Viking,'' he said.

   Former Gov. Ray Blanton, who blamed an
FBI vendetta for his two years in prison, saw his political
comeback derailed Thursday as he ran a distant second for the
Democratic nomination to a congressional seat.
   Blanton, accompanied by his tearful wife, Karen, addressed about
two dozen supporters in Jackson, Tenn. He said prison had made him
sink into depression, but his campaign supporters had ``meant more
to me than you can imagine.''
   ``Not since our forefathers signed the Declaration of
Independence has someone that has been treated as I have, falsely
accused, imprisoned and written off not just as a politician or a
public servant but as a human being, has come back and said, `Look,
I have something to offer' and had so many people embrace the
idea,'' Blanton said.
   ``I have been to the depths of depression when most people would
have said I give up,'' he said.
   Blanton refused to say whether he would run for any other
political office, and would not discuss any reason for his loss.
   Blanton was one of four Democrats vying for the chance to
succeed retiring Rep. Ed Jones in the 8th District. Jones, a
19-year House veteran, has backed state Rep. John Tanner to run
against the winner of the three-way GOP primary.
   With 295 of 316 precincts reporting, Tanner had 43,127 votes, or
67 percent, of Democratic votes. Blanton had 6,809 or 11 percent.
Jackson Mayor Robert Conger had 9,796 votes, or 15 percent; lawyer
Ivy Scarbrough had 5,051, or 8 percent.
   In the Republican race, lawyer Ed Bryant of Jackson came from
behind to defeat Richard Jacobs, national chairman of the Young
Republicans Federation, win the right to meet Tanner in November.
   With 295 of 316 precincts reporting, Bryant polled 6,280 votes,
or 57 percent to 3,839, or 35 percent, for Jacobs. Dan Campbell, a
Memphis businessman, trailed with 810 votes or 7 percent.
   For the Senate, incumbent Democrat James R. Sasser Jr., seeking
his third six-year term, had no primary opposition.
   In the GOP's Senate primary, lawyer Bill Anderson, whose
Kingsport law firm includes former U.S. Sen. Howard Baker as a
partner, beat party activist Alice Algood and and lawyer Hubert
Patty for the chance to oppose Sasser in November.
   With 2,223 of the state's 2,391 precincts reporting, Andersen
had 73 percent or 102,485 votes to 22 percent or 30,718 for Mrs.
Algood.
   ``I want to congratulate Mr. Andersen on a very energetic and
successful campaign and we are going to get our campaign in high
gear,'' Sasser said Thursday night.
   In the 2nd District, where Republican Rep. John J. Duncan died
June 21, his son, John J. Duncan Jr. of Knoxville easily won the
nomination for his late father's seat.
   With all 190 precincts in the East Tennessee district reporting,
Duncan had 32,813 votes, or 87 percent. Dr. Robert Proffitt had
4,913 votes, or 13 percent.
   Dudley Taylor, a former state revenue commissioner, led in
Democratic voting in the 2nd District.
   With all 190 precincts, Taylor had 7,713 votes, or 41 percent,
to 5,249 or 28 percent for Robert Scott, a chemical engineering
professor. Political unknown John Bowen, who conducted no campaign,
had 5,639 votes or 30 percent.
   U.S. Reps. Marilyn Lloyd of Chattanooga and Harold Ford of
Memphis won renomination as expected in Democratic primaries in the
3rd and 9th districts, respectively.
   With all 220 precincts reporting, Ms. Lloyd had 89 percent, or
81,017 votes against newcomers Walter Ward, with 2,168 votes or 6
percent, and Lamar Lasley, with 1,822 votes or 5 percent.
   Ford, with 156 of 187 precincts reporting, had 29,410 votes, or
80 percent against businessman Mark A. Flanagan, who lost to Ford
for the eighth straight time. Flanagan had 7,310 votes or 20
percent.
   Ford has been indicted in federal court on bank fraud charges,
but no trial date has been set. He said it has not affected his
campaign.
   In the 7th District primary contest, Democrat Lloyd Bloodworth
defeated Frances Tapp of Memphis for the right to challenge
Republican U.S. Rep. Don Sundquist in November.
   With 279 of 327 precincts reporting, Bloodworth had 65 percent
or 11,722 votes to 35 percent or 6,200 for Tapp.

   Blanton, also a former congressman, spent two years in federal
prison after being convicted of conspiracy, extortion and mail
fraud in a public corruption case. The mail fraud counts were
vacated in line with a U.S. Supreme Court decision, and Blanton is
appealing the extortion and conspiracy convictions.
   The ex-governor, who left office in 1979 in a swirl of
controversy over the sale of pardons and liquor licenses, has said
that he expects voters to realize that he was a victim of political
persecution in the FBI investigation.
   ``They know I was railroaded and falsely accused,'' he said.
   Five of the state's nine U.S. representatives had no primary
opposition. Two, Reps. Jim Cooper of the 4th District and Bob
Clement of the 5th, also have no opponents in the Nov. 8 general
election.
   Others without primary opposition were Republican James Quillen,
seeking his 13th two-year term from the 1st District; Democrat Bart
Gordon of the 6th District; and Sundquis.
   Democrat Sidney Smith, a retiree, was unopposed in his bid to
challenge Quillen. Chemical engineer Wallace Embry had no opponents
for GOP nomination to take on Gordon. Hamilton County Commissioner
Harold Coker faced no contest in getting the Republican nomination
for the 3rd District seat now held by Lloyd.

   ``The market is almost directionless,'' said another broker.
Share prices ``are switching back and forth to rise and fall day by

<HEAD>Rep. Mario Biaggi Convicted In Wedtech Scandal</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Mario Biaggi was convicted of racketeering
in a far-reaching bribery and extortion scheme used to transform a
tiny South Bronx machine shop into the multimillion-dollar defense
contractor known as Wedtech.
   After Biaggi's conviction by a federal jury Thursday, the
leadership of the House of Representatives set Sept. 7 as the date
for considering a recommendation from its Ethics Committee that it
expel the 10-term Democrat.
   ``The overwhelming likelihood is that the recommendation will be
followed,'' Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., said in Washington.
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani called on Congress to expel
Biaggi, who was convicted last year on an unrelated corruption
charge.
   ``Maybe it's time they acted,'' Giuliani told a news conference.
``This congressman has been convicted of numerous felonies.''
   Earlier this year, the Ethics Committee recommended Biaggi be
expelled for the earlier conviction. But the committee held off
sending the resolution to the House floor until after the Wedtech
trial so Biaggi could defend himself in person.
   After five days of deliberations, the jury found Biaggi and four
co-defendants guilty of turning now-defunct Wedtech Corp. into an
enterprise that paid millions in bribes to public officials.
   Biaggi, a city policeman from 1942 to 1965 and at one time the
most decorated police officer in the country, was also convicted of
extortion and bribe-taking.
   ``We're obviously disappointed, and we're going to appeal,''
Biaggi, 70, said outside the courtroom. Earlier, he had complained
of chest pains and was treated in the courthouse nurses' office.
   It was the second legal blow of the week for Biaggi, whose 1987
conviction was upheld Monday by a federal appeals court.
   U.S. District Judge Constance Baker Motley scheduled sentencing
for Nov. 18. All six of the convicted defendants remained free on
bail.
   Biaggi's eldest son, Richard, 39, of Fort Lee, N.J., was
acquitted of racketeering charges but convicted of bribe taking,
mail fraud and tax charges.
   Also convicted of racketeering and other charges were former
Bronx Borough President Stanley Simon, 58; Wedtech founder John
Mariotta, 58, of Scarsdale; former Small Business Administration
regional head Peter Neglia, 40, of Armonk; and Biaggi's former law
partner, Bernard Ehrlich, 59, of Bedford.
   A seventh defendant, former city police officer Ronald Betso,
40, of Brooklyn, was acquitted on all counts.
   Biaggi was convicted of all but one of the 16 counts against
him, including conspiracy, extortion, tax evasion and receiving
bribes.
   He faces up to 20 years in prison on the racketeering counts,
the most serious charges. He has been sentenced to 30 months in
prison for the 1987 conviction in Brooklyn for obstructing justice
and taking an illegal gratuity.
   Prosecutors also sought forfeiture of millions of dollars in
ill-gotten gains by the five convicted of racketeering. In
addition, Biaggi, Mariotta and Ehrlich face fines of more than $7
million each.
   Biaggi was convicted of extorting $50,000 in cash and stock once
worth more than $3 million from Wedtech in exchange for his
political clout. Biaggi also was convicted of filing false
financial disclosure statements and tax returns to cover up his
illegal profits.
   More than 130 witnesses were called in the trial, which began
March 11. Four former Wedtech executives who pleaded guilty to
state and federal corruption charges and testified for the
government in exchange for leniency.
   At the heart of the Wedtech case was how Welbilt Electronic Die
Corp., a tiny machine shop Mariotta started in 1965, became a
multimillion-dollar defense contractor.
   Mariotta was once hailed as a ``hero for the '80s'' by President
Reagan for hiring ex-convicts and former drug addicts in the South
Bronx, one of America's most economically depressed areas.
   Prosecutors, however, charged that Wedtech was built on greed,
and that Mariotta and others at Wedtech bribed Biaggi, Simon and
Neglia for help with city and federal agencies.
   Prosecutors charged that Ehrlich, the younger Biaggi and Betso
helped those three receive or cover up the payoffs.
   However, the defense contended that the corrupt Wedtech
executives who testified had the ear of White House insiders like
Attorney General Edwin Meese III and did not need to bribe Biaggi.
   They noted that former White House aide Lyn Nofziger was
convicted in Washington of illegal lobbying for Wedtech; that Meese
was under investigation by a special prosecutor for his Wedtech
dealings; and that a close Meese friend, lawyer E. Robert Wallach,
was indicted for allegedly taking Wedtech payoffs to influence
Meese and other officials.
   Near the end of the trial, the special prosecutor announced
there was insufficient evidence to charge Meese with wrongdoing,
but questioned the attorney general's ethics on several issues.
   Prosecutors in the Wedtech trial claimed the so-called ``Meese
defense'' was a smoke screen to divert attention away from the
seven defendants.

   Scientists and construction workers
swarmed over this scenic, sunbaked plateau Thursday, making final
preparations for an historic U.S.-Soviet nuclear weapons
verification experiment later this month.
   U.S. Ambassador C. Paul Robinson said the Aug. 17th test and
another planned in the Soviet Union next month were a
``breakthrough in negotiations between the U.S. and Soviet Union on
nuclear testing.
   ``It is unprecedented to be able to exchange this type of data,'
said Robinson, the chief U.S. negotiator at talks with the Soviet
Union on nuclear testing.
   Reporters were taken Thursday to the test site 130 miles
northwest of Las Vegas for a day-long briefing and an impromptu
news conference held on a platform four-tenths of a mile above the
nuclear device.
   The blast will have an explosive punch of up to 150 kilotons,
nearly 12 times the force of the atomic bomb that destroyed the
Japanese city of Hiroshima 43 years ago Saturday.
   Joe Behne, test director from Lawrence Livermore Laboratories,
told the gathering that no one would be allowed within 15 miles of
the site when the device is detonated.
   The experiment is designed to test the ability of the United
States and the Soviet Union to monitor the size of each other's
nuclear tests. Such monitoring is critical to comply with treaties
limiting the size of nuclear tests under a policy of ``trust but
verify.''
   Treaties limiting tests to no more than 150 kilotons were passed
in 1974 and 1976 but never ratified.
   Some three dozen Soviet scientists will be on the Nevada test
site for this month's blast, code-named Kearsarge. American
scientists will monitor the September Soviet test at Semipalatinsk.
   The device that will be detonated later this month was delivered
July 20 and placed 180 feet above the bottom of a 2,200-foot
vertical shaft.
   The Soviet scientists, who have been on the Nevada site since
spring, were not allowed to see the device itself, according to
Behne.
   But the Soviets were allowed to examine the 8-foot canister
holding the device once the container, painted red white and blue,
was sealed.
   The joint verification experiment will focus on cables half an
inch in diameter, running to the site of detonation from instrument
trailers hundreds of yards away and down to the device itself.
Additional cables are placed in a second hole 30 feet away from and
parallel to the weapon shaft.
   The tests come two years after President Reagan proposed using a
system called Corrtex, which is designed to measure the size of a
nuclear blast by the shock waves emitted from the nuclear device.
   The Soviets will be using a similar system of their own called
Miz and a second system which takes similar measurements.
   The joint tests are to determine whether the two monitoring
systems are compatible and whether explosions can be monitored by
having the cables only in the second hole.
   The sticking point for both countries has been the idea of
allowing one country to place monitoring cables in the same hole as
the device itself.
   The breakthrough on the test verification issue came late last
year in talks at Geneva when both sides agreed to exchange
scientists and monitor a test at each site. Officials say that if
the monitoring systems work, each country could have scientists at
the other's nuclear test site for all future tests.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department said Thursday it is
working with debt-troubled Argentina to arrange a short-term loan
of up to $500 million from the United States and other creditor
nations.
   The so-called ``bridge'' loan would allow Argentina to meet
interest payments on its $56 billion foreign debt while it
negotiates with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   But, according to a department statement, funds from the
short-term loan, will not become available until Argentina ``meets
the requirements ... under the World Bank's ... lending program.''
   Argentina, which is more than 90 days past due on more than $300
million in payments, has said it cannot afford to make its overdue
interest payments.
   Recently, the nation has taken measures to cut its budget
deficit and check its inflation, running about 20 percent a month.
This week, it declared a three-day bank holiday and devalued its
currency.
   ``The United States' willingness to participate in this effort
reflects support for Argentina's economic reform efforts and the
determination of the government of Argentina to address its
international financial relations in a constructive manner,'' the
Treasury statement said.
   It said the United States is working with other creditor
governments through the Bank for International Settlements, a
clearinghouse in Switzerland for central banks, to formulate the
bridge loan.
   ``These efforts will be fully supported as well by the World
Bank and we expect that they will be supported as well by the
international financial community,'' it said.
   In its own statement, The IMF said it was ready to start
negotiations with Argentina for a $1.2 billion loan.
   The United States last month offered a similar bridge loan to
Brazil, which is seeking to restore its standing in the
international financial community after declaring a moratorium on
its debt payments last year.

   The House on Thursday gave lopsided bipartisan
approval to a $7.1 billion election-year package of minor tax
changes that would benefit farmers, mutual-fund owners, free-lance
writers and rural mail carriers.
   The targeted tax cuts would be financed by higher taxes on
defense contractors, certain other corporations, pipe smokers and
purchasers of single-premium life insurance policies.
   The 380-25 vote for the bill was easily the widest margin by
which any tax legislation has been approved over the last decade.
Voting for the measure were 230 Democrats and 150 Republicans; 6
Democrats and 19 Republicans voted no.
   The bill now goes to the Senate, where the Finance Committee has
approved a stripped-down version.
   The chief purpose of the 960-page House bill is to correct
errors and clear up ambiguities in the landmark tax overhaul enaced
in 1986. Since this is almost certainly the only tax bill with a
chance of becoming law this year, the Ways and Means Committee used
it to carry dozens of substantive tax changes.
   Despite its size, the bill is one of the smallest pieces of tax
legislation in recent years. The Joint Committee on Taxation
estimates it would cut taxes by about $7.1 billion through 1991 and
raise taxes by about $47 million less than that amount.
   Nevertheless, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., committee chairman,
told the House, ``This bill is in keeping with the spirit of tax
reform.''
   He and Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, senior Republican on the
committee, emphasized that unlike most tax bills of recent years,
the legislation includes no tax breaks that are targeted for the
benefit of only one or two individuals or corporations.
   Among the dozens of provisions are those to:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Wipe out a 1987 requirement that farmers, construction
companies and other tax-exempt off-road users of diesel fuel pay
the federal tax of 15.1 cents a gallon and later apply for a
refund. Farmers especially have objected to the loss of cash flow
and paperwork.
   _Permanently permit owners of mutual fund shares to deduct
certain operating expenses of the fund without regard to a general
provision allowing deduction of only miscellaneous expenses that
exceed 2 percent of income.
   _Allow a worker to avoid tax on up to $1,500 of year of
employer-provided education assistance, down from an earlier $5,250
level. Most graduate education (except for teaching or research
assistance) would not qualify.
   _Extend through 1990 a tax credit for owners of newly
constructed low-income rental housing.
   _Impose a tax of $2.67 per pound on pipe tobacco.
   _Extend through 1990 a tax exemption for bonds issued by state
and local governments to help low-income families buy their first
home.
   _Allow free-lance writers, artists and photographers to deduct
work-related expenses even before a project produces income.
Similar relief from general ``uniform capitalization'' rules would
be included for certain livestock producers (the so-called heifer
tax) and growers of pistachio nuts.
   _Allow an 80 percent deduction for contributions to college
athletic scholarship funds even when such ``gifts'' guarantee a fan
the privilege of buying a game ticket.
   _Extend through 1990 a credit under which the government pays
the first year of wages for certain newly hired economically
disadvantaged workers.
   _Repeal the completed-contract accounting method, which has
produced tax savings for defense contractors and large construction
companies.
   _Reduce from 70 percent to 50 percent the dividend-received
deduction for corporations that own less than 20 percent of the
stock in another.
   _Repeal a provision that has allowed Alaska Native corporations
to sell some of their unused tax credits to other companies.
Lawmakers say the benefit has been badly abused.
   _Remove some of the tax advantages of using single-premium life
insurance as an investment. Loans from such policies would be taxed
as cash withdrawals; the new rules would apply to policies whose
cash value builds more quickly than one paid through seven equal
annual premiums.
   _Allow rural mail carriers to deduct 33.75 cents for each mile a
personal car is driven on a mail route; most people are allowed
22.5 cents a mile for business-related mileage.
   _Permit operators of offshore or Alaska oil rigs and of some
commercial vessels (but not luxury liners) to deduct the full cost
of meals provided to employees; most business may deduct only 80
percent.
   _Allow a surviving spouse to defer taxation on certain profits
from the sale of a principal home, just as though the spouse had
not died. Present law denies such a break if a spouse dies after a
home is sold and before a new one is built.
   _Prohibit any person with a home-based business (including
moonlighters) from deducting any part of the base monthly telephone
charge as a business expense.
   _Deny Social Security benefits to deported Nazi war criminals.
   _Permit states and blood-collection facilities to require blood
donors to list their Social Security numbers so they can be traced
if tests determine their blood is carryng the AIDS virus.
   _Exempt from Social Security taxes employees from Amish and
other sects with religious objections to the program; self-employed
already are exempt.

<HEAD>`Checkmates,' A New Comedy, Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Checkmates'' is a crudely constructed,
cartoonish comedy by Ron Milner about the generation gap, but this
time the gap isn't between father and son or mother and daughter.
It's a chasm between two married couples.
   These middle-class couples also happen to be black, but don't
expect any revelations about race relations and what being black in
a white society can do to a marriage. ``Checkmates,'' which opened
Thursday at the 46th Street Theater, is played mainly for laughs _
cheap laughs, easy laughs, laughs that do little to illuminate
character or advance the plot.
   Plot is something that ``Checkmates'' rarely encounters. The
play is mostly a series of sitcom sketches populated by one couple
or the other as they fight, make love or just try to get through
the day. Naturally, these people are a study in contrast.
   Frank and Mattie Cooper have been married for 45 years. They
have four children, six grandchildren and a comfortable home in
Detroit where they are getting through Frank's retirement by
talking about the couple upstairs.
   Their tenants are Sylvester and Laura Williams, young, upwardly
mobile and and preoccupied with ``self'' rather than ``we.'' He's a
salesman. She works as a buyer for a department store. Career
conflicts _ she's on the way up, he could be on the way down _
threaten their marriage.
   The audience watches as one marriage reaffirms itself and the
other falls apart. But it's hard to care for these characters
whether they are up or down.
   Milner wrote the book for ``Don't Get God Started,'' a gospel
show that ran on Broadway for several months last season. It was a
musical morality tale with dramatized lessons about life and love
interspersed with some rousing gospel songs.
   Those same messages about sharing, caring and giving show up in
``Checkmates,'' but this time there are no soaring melodies to lift
the spirits between the sagging and soggy vingettes.
   To pad out the evening, the playwright flashes back to tell the
older couple's story. You can tell when that happens because the
lighting _ some lurid effects by designer Ronald Wallace _ changes
color. In these moments, the audience learns of Frank's decision to
leave his family and fight during World War II as well as his
affair with a French woman.
   At least the production has been superbly cast, with Ruby Dee
and Paul Winfield starring as the older duo and Denzel Washington
and Marsha Jackson appearing as the younger couple.
   Miss Dee is a radiant actress and Winfield a forceful stage
presence, so they mine the comedy for every giggle they can. It's
depressing to watch them work so hard with such meager results.
   Washington has an ingratiating stage manner. He survives because
of his winning personality and not because of anything the author
gives him to say or do. Miss Jackson, as the young wife, has a
harder job. She must always be on the offensive, hammering away at
her husband or whining about her job, and the complaints grow
tiresome.
   The wide stage at the 46th Street Theater has been sliced in
half by two separate apartments, both realistically designed by
Edward Burbridge. The action alternates between the two homes with
the predictability of a boring tennis match.
   Director Woodie King, Jr., doesn't do anything to lessen the
ping-pong effect. But it's hard to see what King could have done to
liven up the evening. Because of Milner's simple-minded and obvious
script, ``Checkmates'' is checkmated even before the curtain goes
up.

   Retired baseball star and classic car
collectdor Reggie Jackson lost 35 automobiles when fire destroyed a
warehouse where the cars were stored and caused $4 million in
damage, officials said Thursday.
   The fire apparently started in a furniture store Wednesday night
and spread to the warehouse in the same cinderblock building.
   The fire department said 35 cars owned by Jackson were
destroyed, including Corvettes, Porsches, Barracudas, Mustangs and
other ``high-value collector cars,'' said Capt. Ron Littley, who
also said five motorcycles were destroyed.
   Jackson, who lives in nearby Oakland, was visibly upset when he
went to the warehouse Thursday. He declined to be interviewed at
his Berkeley automobile dealership, saying he was ``down'' and
``hurting'' about the loss.
   Jackson began his car collection in 1971 when he bought a 1940
Chevrolet for $300 and a color television. By last October, the
collection had grown to 97 vehicles. The rest of his collection was
stored elsewhere.
   The fire, visible from the Bay Bridge, raged out of control in
the 33,000-square-foot warehouse in an industrial area for more
than an hour.
   ``Everything that was in there was gone,'' said fire Lt. David
Allen. The cause of the blaze was not immediately known.
   Jackson retired last fall from the Oakland Athletics after a
career that included stints with the California Angels, Baltimore
Orioles and New York Yankees.

<TEXT>
   A man who said he grew up with ``prejudices
against anything that isn't white'' pleaded guilty Thursday to a
charge that he had threatened to kill black Democratic presidential
aspirant Jesse Jackson.
   Londell Williams, 30, pleaded innocent in May to four charges
contained in a federal indictment against him. He had been
scheduled to stand trial Aug. 8.
   Under a plea bargain, he pleaded guilty Thursday before U.S.
District Judge Edward Filippine to charges of threatening Jackson's
life and possessing an unregistered automatic rifle.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney David Rosen said he would move to drop
the other two charges _ threatening and intimidating a government
informant _ at sentencing, scheduled for Oct. 14.
   Williams faces up to 13 years in prison and $500,000 in fines.
   Williams and his wife, Tammy, 27, were arrested May 13 at their
apartment in Washington, Mo., about 50 miles west of St. Louis. At
the time, Jackson was campaigning for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
   The Williams were arrested after an informant told authorities
that they were involved in a conspiracy with white supremacists to
kill Jackson. The informant agreed to meet again with Williams and
wear a hidden microphone.
   The indictment did not mention conspiracy and the FBI was unable
to find any evidence that the Williamses belong to a white
supremacist organization.
   On Thursday, Rosen read part of the transcript of their recorded
conversation, in which Williams said Jackson was ``trying to make a
fool out of us white people'' by running for president.
   Williams said it was time Jackson ``goes into the refrigerator.
And that's what I'm about.'' After he was arrested, Williams told
reporters that he grew up with ``prejudices against anything that
isn't white.''
   ``There seems to be a white United States of America,'' he said.
``That's how I've been raised.''
   Mrs. Williams was indicted on charges of possessing an
unregistered automatic rifle, and threatening and intimidating the
government informant. She has pleaded innocent. Rosen said her
trial is set for Sept. 6.

   A lobbyist for gun owners was justified
in fatally shooting an intruder who broke into his gun store two
weeks ago, a grand jury decided Thursday.
   Donn DiBiasio, 59, of Smithfield, used reasonable force in
defending himself, even though he shot the intruder more than once,
Attorney General James E. O'Neil said at a Thursday news conference.
   DiBiasio's case was turned over to the grand jury July 21, the
day after he fatally shot Wayne E. Costa, 23, three times at his
Providence store, D&B Antenna & Electronics and D-B Guns.
   He was arrested shortly after the incident and charged with
murder, then arraigned and released on $1,000 personal recognizance
the following day.
   ``It means the world has been lifted off my shoulders,'' said
DiBiasio after Thursday's announcement. ``I think this certainly
gives a message to the citizens of Rhode Island ... that the police
cannot protect all citizens at all times.''
   O'Neil denied earlier news reports that DiBiasio had appeared to
lie in wait for the intruder, since he was in the store around
10:30 p.m. when the break occurred. O'Neil said DiBiasio just
happened to be in the store.
   O'Neil said he was satisfied with the grand jury's findings and
does not think it will encourage vigilante acts.
   The grand jury heard the testimony of 13 people and police
reports and took two weeks to come up with the decision, O'Neil
said.
   DiBiasio, a Statehouse lobbyist for the Rhode Island State Rifle
and Revolver Association for 20 years, said he intends to keep his
store open.

   Former Rep. Barbara Jordan, recovering from a near
drowning, talked politics with reporters and her nurses Thursday,
and said she's feeling much better.
   ``I really feel great. All I know is right now, I could not die
because this is the Democrats' year and I have got to be around to
celebrate it,'' said Ms. Jordan, 52, who remained in fair condition
at Brackenridge Hospital.
   Ms. Jordan gave the seconding speech for Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of
Texas as the Democrats' vice presidential candidate at the party's
recent Democratic National Convention.
   Sitting in a chair in her hospital room, Ms. Jordan remarked on
the good wishes she has received from across the nation.
   ``I have received cards, telegrams, letters, flowers from all
over this country,'' she said. ``If I did have the desire to return
to active politics, I think I could make a good run at national
office. I am very grateful and I feel very fortunate to have so
many people feel do deeply and care so much for me.''
   The former three-term congresswoman and first black state
senator in Texas history said she has no plans to leave her current
teaching job at the University of Texas' Lyndon B. Johnson School
of Public Affairs.
   ``My plans were and are to continue to teach ... and to continue
to educate young minds to take over this country,'' she said.
   Ms. Jordan said she didn't remember much about the accident that
happened around noon Saturday. She lost consciousness while in her
backyard swimming pool and was found face-down in the pool by her
roommate.
   Ms. Jordan, who uses a wheelchair because she suffers from what
doctors say is a disease similar to multiple sclerosis, swims for
exercise. She said she hopes the accident won't make her afraid to
continue.
   ``I hope that I'm not traumatized by this event so I refrain
from doing that ... I enjoyed it,'' she said.
   She also said she was grateful for the efforts of the emergency
medical service technicians and hospital helicopter crew who
rescued her.
   ``It's a compilation of people who did superb work to see to it
that I can sit here today and talk to you. And I thank them and am
grateful for it,'' she said.
   Ms. Jordan is being treated in the hospital's critical care
unit. Doctors said she may remain hospitalized for about four more
days.

<HEAD>Redford's Trip To Cuba Reportedly Under Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department is reportedly
investigating whether actor-director Robert Redford violated U.S.
law during a recent three-day trip to Cuba.
   An attorney for Redford, however, says the inquiry is not an
investigation.
   Redford, 50, returned from Cuba last May from what he described
as a script-writing workshop for women in Havana. Redford, whose
latest film, ``The Milagro Beanfield War,'' is showing in Cuban and
American theaters, said he also met with Cuban President Fidel
Castro.
   Scripps Howard News Service reported Thursday that Richard
Newcomb, director of the Treasury enforcement office in Washington,
wrote Redford in May and asked him to explain whether he paid his
own expenses or whether they were paid by Cuba. He also wanted to
know how and where he entered the country.
   Newcomb declined to comment Thursday when he was contacted at
home by The Associated Press. He said any comment would have to
come from department spokesman Charles Power.
   A U.S. trade ban with Cuba bars all unlicensed economic
transactions in which Cuba has an interest.
   Vincent Chieffo, an attorney for Redford in Los Angeles,
confirmed Thursday that the actor received a letter from the
treasury department asking about his trip to Cuba.
   ``I wouldn't really call it an investigation. They sent a letter
and we told them the facts,'' Chieffo said.
   Another lawyer representing Redford, Robert Gipson, also
declined to give details.
   ``We have written them (Newcomb's office) a letter. Our view of
the federal regulations is there was no violation,'' Gipson said.
``But we're still talking to them about it. From Redford's point,
it was a cultural exchange effort.''
   Earlier, Redford told The Washington Post that he ``chatted
briefly'' with Castro and was invited to lead a film school
workshop in Havana next year. Redford said he plans to invite Latin
American filmmakers to the Sundance Institute, his film production
facility south of Salt Lake City.

   Experts from the International Civil
Aviation Organization visited the site where an Iran Air jetliner
was shot down by a U.S. warship and inspected chunks of wreckage,
Iran said Thursday.
   The report was carried by Tehran's official Islamic Republic
News Agency before the five-man ICAO team left for Dubai in the
United Arab Emirates. The Airbus A-300 was headed from Bandar Abbas
to Dubai when missiles from the USS Vincennes hit it July 3,
killing all 290 people aboard.
   IRNA said the search continued for bodies and the flight data
recorder. It said 186 bodies had been recovered.
   The ICAO, a United Nations agency based in Montreal, said the
investigators traveled on Wednesday to the area off Hengham Island
where the plane crashed into the gulf, and also examined documents
at the Bandar Abbas airport.
   American officials have said the Vincennes crew believed the
airliner was an Iranian F-14 jet fighter on an attack course. U.S.
Defense Department sources said Wednesday preliminary findings show
human error rather than malfunctioning equipment was the cause.
   The ICAO assists international civil aviation by establishing
technical standards for safety and efficiency of air navigation.

   The 35-count indictment Thursday named five top partners and

former trader in the junk-bond department of Drexel in Beverly
Hills, Calif.
   The charges arose from an alleged scheme involving the bogus

thanks to the relentless heat wave that kept shoppers at home, the
stores have reported.
   The July results announced Thursday ended a modest recovery the
stores enjoyed in June _ which followed a slump in April and May
caused by cold and rain.
   July generally is not an important month for retailers except

for the economy's competitive vigor.
   The efficiency of non-farm businesses in producing goods and
services declined 1.7 percent in April through June, its first
decrease since 1986 and the biggest decline since 1981, the Labor
Department said Thursday.
   Productivity had risen at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in the

   A lawyer for Eastern Airlines has told a
federal judge the financially troubled carrier can not comply with
his broad order not to curtail flights and drop service to 14
cities.
   Michael Madigan told U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker on
Thursday that there were ``numerous operational difficulties'' to
complying with a blanket order to halt implementation of Eastern's
plans to reduce service by 201 flights a day by Aug. 31.
   Eastern, which has sought wage concessions from its unions,
wants to close its hub in Kansas City, Mo., and focus operations on

   A savings and loan trade group is calling on
federal regulators to freeze the growth of ``walking dead'' thrift
institutions that are insolvent but still open.
   Charles John Koch, chairman of the National Council of Savings
Institutions, said Thursday the Federal Home Loan Bank Board should
bar 444 ``hopelessly insolvent'' S&Ls from making new loans.
   Koch said the bank board cannot practically close down all
insolvent institutions immediately, but should take steps now to
ensure the insolvents do not hurt the profitability of the rest of
the industry.

   A major trade bill awaiting President Reagan's signature is
being labeled protectionist by several of America's leading trade
partners, who warned that the legislation could harm international
relations.
   U.S. trading partners said Thursday they opposed the trade
bill's provision that would make it easier for the U.S. government
to impose import curbs in retaliation for alleged unfair trading
practices by other nations.
   The Senate approved the bill Wednesday by an 85-11 vote. The
measure, aimed at reviving U.S. competitiveness abroad, cleared the
House of Representatives earlier, and President Reagan has
indicated he will sign it.

<HEAD>Productivity Deteriorates In Second Quarter</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Will be led with Labor Department report on July
unemployment, scheduled for 8:30 am EDT release.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Business productivity deteriorated at a rate not seen in seven
years while labor costs soared during the second quarter, the
government has said in a report that sparked sparking concern over
the future of the economy's competitive vigor.
   In another report on Thursday, the nation's largest retailers
said sales for July were lackluster as unusually hot weather kept
many consumers out of stores.
   The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said the
efficiency of non-farm businesses in producing goods and services
declined 1.7 percent in the quarter ended June 30, its first
decline in two years and the biggest drop since 1981.
   Productivity had risen at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in the
second quarter and had been improving at a rate of 1 percent to 2
percent annually in the previous three years.
   Reflecting the strong economic expansion, output of goods and
services by those businesses responsible for three-fourths of U.S.
economic activity rose 4.7 percent in the second quarter.
   But to achieve that growth, companies increased their work hours
by 6.5 percent, hiring hundreds of thousands of new employees to
send the unemployment rate to a 14-year low of 5.3 percent.
   Meanwhile, labor costs soared 5.9 percent in the first quarter
as hourly wages and benefits rose at an annual rate of 4.1 percent.
   After taking into account a 4.4 percent annual rate of inflation
in the last 18 months, workers' purchasing power actually declined
0.6 percent from April through June, the department said.
   Among retailers, the nation's biggest store chains were at the
mercy of weather extremes as a relentless heat wave kept shoppers
home last month, preventing stores from clearing out their summer
merchandise.
   The July results ended a modest recovery the stores enjoyed in
June, which had followed a slump in April and May caused by cold
and rain.
   Overall, consumers have cut back on their retail outlays over
the past year and a half because of high installment debt levels
and uncertainty about the economy. As a result, retailers' sales
have been a soft spot in an otherwise strong economy.
   Consumer spending, which also includes expenditures for food,
medical care, autos, utilities, transportation and other
necessities, is watched closely because it accounts for two-thirds
of the gross national product.

   Disappointment with the outcome of an OPEC
committee meeting and a report on U.S. oil supplies continues to
weaken oil futures prices.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for September
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude oil, fell 23 cents a barrel Thursday to close at $15.03. The
September contract had dropped sharply on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   Futures prices of refined oil products were mostly lower. The
September contract for wholesale heating oil fell 0.50 cent a
gallon to finish at 42.46 cents. Wholesale unleaded gasoline for
September slipped 0.26 cent a gallon to 44.95 cents, although most
other contract months rose.
   Analysts said prices continued to be dragged down by
disappointment that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries' price monitoring committee ended its meeting Wednesday
in Lausanne, Switzerland without any major announcements or a call
for a full meeting of OPEC ministers.
   Another cloud hanging over the market was a report released late
Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute on domestic oil and
gasoline supplies. Many traders had expected gasoline and oil
inventories to decline, but the API reported that stocks rose.
   ``You have problems with the (gasoline inventories); you have
problems with OPEC ... We're weak again because of that,'' said
Chris McCormack, a broker in the international energy department at
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.

<TEXT>
   Hot weather sent the nation's largest general retailers back
into a slump during July, but the stores and Wall Street analysts
are looking toward August with some optimism.
   Last month's relentless heat largely kept shoppers out of
stores, hampered retailers' attempts to clear out summer
merchandise and made sales reports issued by the stores Thursday
disappointing.
   The higher temperatures ended a modest rally the retailers
enjoyed in June.
   In addition to weather, the stores' reports reflected the
overall softness that has plagued the retail industry for about a
year and a half, said Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst with Merrill Lynch
& Co.
   Consumers have cut back on their retail spending because of high
installment debt levels and uncertainty about the economy. As a
result, retailers' sales have been a soft spot in an otherwise
strong economy.
   Consumer spending, which also includes expenditures for food,
medical care, autos, utilities, transportation and other
necessities, is watched closely because it accounts for two-thirds
of the gross national product.
   Walter Loeb, an analyst with the investment firm Morgan Stanley
& Co., said July generally is not an important month for retailers.
   But this month will be critical, especially for apparel
retailers who have been in a year-long slump as women turned away
from the retailers' offerings of shorter skirts and clothes
shoppers widely perceived as boring.
   The retailers have revamped their fall lines, and analysts
predict there will be a pickup in clothing sales that may begin
showing up in the stores' August results.
   ``I would expect sales would accelerate,'' Loeb said. ``I am
looking for a good August.''
   In their reports Thursday, several retailers recorded sales
increases under 3 percent _ meaning the stores were losing ground
to inflation, which has run at an annual rate of 4.4 percent so far
this year.
   The nation's largest retailer, Sears, Roebuck & Co., said its
overall sales rose 7.2 percent last month and 5.4 percent for the
first half of the fiscal year, compared with the same periods of
1987. Sears' sales for stores open at least a year, so-called
same-store sales, were up 2.5 percent last month and 2.1 percent
for the year so far.
   Retailers and industry analysts believe same-store sales are a
more accurate yardstick of a company's performance than figures
which include sales from new stores.
   K mart Corp. said its overall sales rose 4.8 percent last month
and 5.3 percent during the first half, while same-store sales edged
up 0.7 percent in July and 1.8 percent for the year to date.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said its overall sales rose 30 percent in
July and 31 percent for the first half. Same-store sales rose 14
percent last month and 12 percent so far this year.
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. said its overall sales rose 2.7 percent in
July and 2.6 percent for the first six months. Same-store sales
were up 2.1 percent last month and 1.6 percent in the first half.
   Dayton Hudson Corp. said its overall sales were up 13.1 percent
last month, and 17.6 percent for the year to date. The company's
same-store sales slipped 0.9 percent during July, while rising 1.5
percent over the first half.
   May Department Stores Co. said its overall sales rose 23.5
percent in July, and 12 percent over the first half. Same-stores
sales increased 4 percent for the month, and 1.2 percent so far
this year.
   F.W. Woolworth Co. reported an 11.1 percent sales gain for July,
and an 11.9 increase for the first six months.
   Montgomery Ward & Co. said its sales rose 1 percent last month,
and 2.8 percent over the first half.
   The results reported Thursday were from general merchandise and
apparel retailers. Unlike monthly retail sales figures released by
the federal government, they do not include sales at auto dealers,
supermarkets or restaurants.

   Help-wanted advertising inched down in June,
reflecting the continued stability in the job market, according to
the Conference Board.
   The board, a business-financed research group, said Thursday its
seasonally adjusted help-wanted index dropped to 157 in June from
160 in May, but was ahead of the June 1987 figure of 152.
   The index measures the volume of classified ads in 51 major U.S.
newspapers.
   Kenneth Goldstein, an economist for the group, said the index
responded to strong labor market conditions that have given way to
stability and added that there were no signs of sustained weakening.
   ``The help-wanted advertising numbers have been sending the same
message since the end of last year,'' he said.
   New England showed the biggest decline in help-wanted ads, with
a drop of 8.3 percent, the Conference Board said. Ads were down in
all regions of the country, with the exception of the Midwest,
where volume was up about 4.8 percent.

<HEAD>Business Week Tells Its Side Of Scandal Story</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business Week says it has not uncovered any
evidence implicating its editorial employees in a spreading scandal
involving pre-publication leaks of the magazine's stock tips, and
again has defended its actions in dealing internally with its
suspicions without telling authorities.
   The magazine in its Aug. 15 issue, released to the press late
Thursday, gave its first detailed account of the scandal, two weeks
after first confirming it was investigating the leaks.
   So far, seven people around the nation have been forced from
their jobs in connection with the magazine scandal, and federal law
enforcement officials have begun a criminal investigation.
   Evidence uncovered so far suggests some printers at two of the
four plants that print Business Week peddled unpublished copies to
brokers, who bought stocks recommended by the ``Inside Wall
Street'' column and sold them later at a profit after publication
attracted more buyers and boosted the price of the stocks.
   In the Aug. 15 issue, Business Week estimated that price changes
in 20 stocks mentioned in the column this year generated potential
profits of $2.4 million. ``Few appear to have made a killing,'' the
magazine said.
   Business Week, which is published by McGraw-Hill Inc., said its
editors detected questionable price changes in stocks mentioned in
the column as far back as early last year.
   But the magazine's editors met with McGraw-Hill lawyers, who
recommended against reporting the matter to the Securities and
Exchange Commission, Business Week said. The story said Business
Week had nothing but suspicions about stock price movements and had
no concrete evidence implicating anyone.
   While Business Week was under no legal obligation to notify the
SEC, the story said, magazine editors also were concerned that an
investigation ``might raise First Amendment problems,'' namely that
investigators might demand the names of confidential sources of
Gene Marcial, who regularly writes the column.
   Instead, the magazine attempted to ``police its own shop'' by
sharply reducing the number of Business Week copies distributed in
the McGraw-Hill building before the official release date from 600
to 20.
   The magazine also sent letters to its printers citing ``the
widespread concern about insider trading'' and reminding them of
the confidentiality policy.
   Business Week said the suspicious trading seemed to subside for
awhile, but then reappeared this past spring.
   The price moves attracted the attention of the Stock Watch
department of the New York Stock Exchange, which began its own
inquiry but did not notify Business Week or the SEC, the story said.
   The Dow Jones Professional Investor Report made the first public
disclosure of the suspicious stock movements in a story July 21,
Business Week finally confirmed its own probe and the scandal began
snowballing.

<HEAD>Rental Company Admits Overcharging, Agrees to Multimillion Dollar
Payback</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hertz Corp., forced to pay a record $6.85
million fine for overbilling insurance companies and thousands of
consumers for the costs of repairing damaged rental cars, says it
has cleaned up its business practices.
   A federal judge on Thursday slapped the auto rental giant with
the fine and required it to pay restitution that brings Hertz'
total bill to more than $20 million, after the company pleaded
guilty to bilking customers and insurance companies with
fraudulently inflated collision repair charges.
   Hertz cheated customers out of more than $13 million between
Jan. 1, 1978 and the summer of 1985, when it learned that a federal
grand jury was investigating the company, Andrew J. Maloney, the
U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, told a news conference.
   Those who paid money to Hertz because of auto-body damage during
the period may be eligible for a refund ranging from a few dollars
to several thousand dollars, according to assistant U.S. Attorney
Jonny J. Frank, who led the investigation.
   Maloney said the $6.85 million fine was believed to be the
largest ever imposed in a consumer fraud case.
   U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson assessed the penalty during
a proceeding in which the company pleaded guilty to mail fraud and
agreed to make restitution.
   Nickerson said that within the next 15 days Hertz must deposit
$13.7 million into a special fund to be disbursed to individuals
and insurance companies that were overcharged. Hertz will have to
to pay even more if the fund is insufficient, the judge said.
   ``Today's action by the United States attorney's office is
deeply disturbing to me and everyone at Hertz,'' Frank Olson,
chairman of the company, said in a statement. ``We regret that
improper practices took place and are fully committed to making
full refunds of all overcharges.''
   John Martin, a lawyer for Hertz, said low-level managers in the
company had been responsible for the overbilling and top executives
had been unaware of the practices. Everyone responsible for the
problem has been fired, he said.
   The investigation began when a woman fired on another matter
from a Hertz office in Massachusetts reported the billing practices
to the Insurance Crime Prevention Institute, an organization funded
by the insurance industry.
   Maloney and the other officials declined to identify the woman.
   In a related state case, New York Attorney General Robert Abrams
said Hertz had agreed to make an additional $2 million in
restitution to some 10,000 customers who paid for repairs between
June 1, 1985, and May 31, 1986.
   The company consented to the order in an agreement with New York
and 40 other states.
   In that case, the company admitted no wrongdoing but agreed to
make the refunds. Abrams said that during the period, Hertz charged
``prevailing retail prices for repairs'' when the actual repair
cost was about 22 percent less.
   Frank said that after Hertz learned in 1985 that it was the
subject of a federal grand jury probe, it altered the fine print in
its rental contract to show it was charging more for repairs than
it was paying.
   This ended the company's criminal activity, but left it open to
the state attorneys general civil action, Frank said.
   In the federal case, Hertz admitted using phony damage claims,
altered documents and inflated repair bills to charge higher prices
than it paid to repair automobiles damaged in accidents.
   Hertz employed a number of techniques to defraud its customers,
prosecutors said.
   Without informing its car renters, Hertz sent to customers who
were involved in an accident or to their insurance companies damage
appraisals that did not reflect discounts the company received
because it operated large fleets of vehicles.
   The company also programmed a computer to produce inflated
damage-repair estimates.
   Hertz also prepared appraisals only on the basis of photographs
or accident reports to set the billed cost of repairing a damaged
car, Maloney said. Hertz disguised these phony appraisals as
legitimate by forging appraisers signatures.
   Maloney said it was not criminal for an automobile rental
company to earn a profit on repairs, but said Hertz acted illegally
by failing to inform its customers and by submitting fraudulent
documents.
   Hertz said it now bills only for its actual cost of repairs and
has discontinued the other illegal practices.
   Maloney said the case should serve as a warning to other
companies.
   ``We do not believe that the practices are limited to the Hertz
Corp. Some of these practices were industrywide,'' he said.

<HEAD>Accounting Firm Helping Business Schools Expand Ethics Education</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the world's biggest accounting firms is
spearheading a $5 million program to help smaller colleges and
universities improve their teaching of business ethics, prompted by
a survey indicating that ethics programs were ``a little spotty.''
   Chicago-based Arthur Andersen & Co. has developed PACE, a
five-year program of seminars aimed at helping faculty at business
schools nationwide to make ethics instruction part of their basic
course work.
   Duane R. Kullberg, the firm's managing partner and chief
executive officer, said Arthur Andersen views the program partly as
an investment in its own future.
   ``As one of the nation's largest employers of business school
graduates, we have a significant interest in their development,''
Kullberg said. ``This program benefits Arthur Andersen as well as
the business community in general.''
   Wall Street's insider-trading scandals and shady
defense-contract deals have focused public attention on moral
issues in business.
   But while many graduate business schools have responded by
introducing ethics courses _ often as electives for MBA candidates
_ few small colleges and public universities can match the
resources of the leading private business schools in developing
such programs.
   Harvard Business School, for example, received a $30 million
gift last year from former Securities and Exchange Commission
Chairman John S.R. Shad to finance a program in ethics education.
   But Kullberg said an Andersen-financed survey found the
development of ethics-education in the business curriculums of
smaller colleges and public universities to be ``a little spotty.''
   ``There is a desire to find a solution, a desire to find a
practical way to deal with the subject,'' he said in a telephone
interview this week.
   So Andersen developed the PACE program and invited
business-school instructors from around the nation to review it.
Some 300 of them came to the Chicago area this spring and summer at
Andersen's expense to attend two-day seminars on incorporating
ethics lessons into their routine course work.
   Andersen has asked the approximately 60 institutions that sent
representatives to this year's seminars to try the PACE approach
for at least one semester.
   The team of ethics teachers, business school instructors and
business professionals who developed PACE decided ethics should be
taught as part of the five basic business disciplines: finance,
marketing, economics, management and accounting.
   ``I see that as a big plus,'' said Conrad Doenges, a professor
of finance at the University of Texas at Austin who attended a PACE
seminar.
   In real life, Doenges said, ``ethical issues can arise at any
point at almost any time.''
   By incorporating ethics discussions into finance courses, he
said, ``the student sees ethical issues as a part of finance, as a
part of his normal business life rather than as a segmented or
compartmented area of study.''
   To foster discussions, PACE offers fictitious case studies
tailored to each discipline. The case studies are meant to reflect
ethical dilemmas that business students might face early in their
careers, such as sexual harassment, truth in advertising, plant
closings, wage discrimination and ledger manipulation.
   The dilemmas have no easy or correct solutions, but are designed
to get students talking and thinking.
   ``Students need to grapple with these issues so they can have
some experience in thinking about these issues,'' said Alison
Ashton, an assistant professor of accounting at Duke University's
Fuqua School of Business.
   Robert Allan Cooke, director of the Institute for Business
Ethics at DePaul University in Chicago and a member of the PACE
development group, said the PACE program was designed to give
business students the basic skill to deal with ethical dilemmas,
just as they learned the basic skills of management and accounting.
   ``We believe very strongly that most ethical problems that arise
come from lack of information and that lack of information results
in poor judgment,'' he said. ``We're trying to provide the
information that will help alleviate those bad judgments.''

<HEAD>Towers Financial Charged With Selling Unregistered Securities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission on
Thursday charged Towers Financial Corp., which has made takeover
overtures for Pan American World Airways Inc., with selling $20
million in unregistered securities.
   The SEC filed a civil suit alleging that Towers failed to
satisfy disclosure requirements when it publicly sold $20 million
in notes between October 1986 and October 1987.
   Towers is a factoring firm, which buys accounts receivable at a
discount and earns a profit by collecting the full face amount.
   ``We say they financed a factoring program with an unlawful
securities offering and we want them to stop,'' said Jason
Gettinger, a staff attorney for the SEC in New York.
   The SEC asked the U.S. District Court to bar Towers from using
the money it received in the securities sales and to issue an
injunction barring the company from further violation of federal
registration requirements. The agency also said it wanted Towers to
return the noteholders' money.
   Ira L. Sorkin, who represents Towers, said the company and its
top executives recognized that ``there may be a technical violation
of the registration provisions of the Federal securities laws and
will make every effort to comply with those provisions.''
   Towers, beginning last year, made a number of announcements
indicating it might make a bid for Pan Am, but has yet to mount a
takeover and was regarded by Wall Street as a questionable suitor.
   But its overtures attracted public attention because the firm
said its offer included support from former Navy Secretary John
Lehman.

<HEAD>LTV Corp. Earnings Up 28 Percent In Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   LTV Corp., operating under Chapter 11 protection
from creditors, said Thursday its second quarter net income rose by
28.4 percent over the same period last year.
   LTV said its net income in the three months ended June 30 rose
to $157.6 million, or $1.14 per share, from $122.7 million, or 91
cents per share, a year earlier.
   A strong increase in steel sales boosted LTV's revenue to $2.1
billion, up from $1.9 billion a year earlier.
   For the six months ended June 30, LTV had net income of $321.5
million, or $2.67 per share, compared with net income of $252.3
million, or $2.17 per share, for the first six months of 1987.
   Revenue for the six months to $3.94 billion from $3.84 billion.
   ``The domestic steel industry's performance has improved as a
result of massive cost cutting, cyclical factors and a more
reasonably valued dollar,'' said Raymond H. Hay, LTV chairman and
chief executive.
   ``However, the industry continues to face the threats of
unfairly priced imported steel, and inadequate long-term return on
invested capital, as well as the risks of successfully weathering
the next economic downturn.''
   Hay emphasized a need to extend voluntary restraint agreements,
set to expire in 1898, to limit steel imports.
   LTV in May submitted a reorganization plan to creditor groups
for consideration.
   At the end of the second quarter, LTV had a negative net worth
of $1.7 billion.
