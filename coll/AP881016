<HEAD>Dukakis Hits Back on Crime; Bush Says He Won't ``Mess Up''</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 3 grafs after 4th graf pvs, bgng: ``I can't ...'' to
UPDATE with report of Dukakis' new 18-state strategy.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis fought to make up ground on George Bush
Saturday, declaring he has reduced home-state crime through a
commitment ``right out of my gut'' while Bush merely postures on
TV. Bush, leading the presidential race with just over three weeks
to go, said, ``I'm not going to mess up.''
   Dukakis received endorsements from Hispanic law-enforcement
groups in Los Angeles and spoke at a rally there before flying to
Texas for more campaigning. Bush, accompanied by Hollywood actors
and two of the Beach Boys singing group, led a bus tour of rallies
in seven California cities.
   Dukakis' running mate, Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, said Saturday
that despite polls showing Republican gains ``the momentum is
ours.'' But he also brought up a story generally cited only by
political longshots _ the 1948 newspaper headline incorrectly
declaring Republican Thomas Dewey had defeated Democratic underdog
Harry Truman.
   ``I can't help but remember Harry Truman out there when the
press had written him off,'' Bentsen told a crowd at a farmers'
market in St. Louis.
   Dukakis managers held a day-long meeting in Boston and set out
an 18-state strategy, focusing largely on economic issues, for
improving the Democratic nominee's election chances, The Washington
Post reported in its Sunday editions.
   ``The issues at stake are too important for the press and the
Republicans to shut this election down three weeks before it
happened,'' said Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach.
   Under the strategy, the Dukakis campaign plans an ``all-out''
drive in 18 states where Dukakis is favored or competitive, the
Post reported. Those 18 states collectively have 272 electoral
votes _ two more than needed to be elected.
   Bush's running mate, Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, campaigned in
Wisconsin, telling cheering supporters in Eau Claire and Appleton
that the state ``is going for George Bush.''
   At the University of Wisconsin at Eau Claire, he ran into
demonstrators carrying signs questioning his military record. He
brushed past them, saying, ``See you after the election.''
   Bush's staff welcomed Quayle back to Washington with a rally and
presented him with a green medical uniform sporting the words ``Dr.
Spin,'' in keeping with the Indiana senator's vow to give his own
``spin,'' or interpretation, to campaign developments.
   Dukakis has been striking back aggressively since Thursday
night's debate, an encounter that polls indicate put him farther
behind Bush.
   He also has been hurt by tough Bush television ads accusing him
of presiding over a Massachusetts prisoner-furlough system that
gave a weekend pass to a murderer who later attacked a Maryland
couple.
   Dukakis said little about such charges for weeks but now
addresses them vigorously and at length.
   On Saturday, he called Bush ``cynical and hypocritical'' for
seeking political gain from what Dukakis calls a tragic incident.
   He spoke of murders in California by inmates on furlough during
Ronald Reagan's governorship. And he said that while Bush has been
vice president there have been thousands of federal prison
furloughs and an incident last year in which an inmate on furlough
raped and murdered a mother of two in Arizona.
   Dukakis also speaks of a murder and rape committed by a man who
escaped from a Houston halfway house Bush supported.
   The governor said that he and Reagan took responsibility for
their programs but that Bush has refused to take blame for his
failures.
   ``Talk versus action, TV commercials versus results, that's what
we're dealing with here,'' Dukakis said, comparing Bush and himself.
   He noted his state's 14 percent decline in the rate of major
crime, and its lowest homicide rate among industrial states. That
progress, he said, resulted from his personal involvement in a
statewide anti-crime council.
   ``I didn't learn my lessons about crime from a Clint Eastwood
movie,'' he told the law-enforcement officers. ``I've been out
there with you.''
   ``This is an issue that is very close to me,'' he said. ``It
comes right out of my gut.''
   In his Texas appearance, Dukakis spoke warmly of the Texas
senator who is his running mate.
   ``Lloyd Bentsen and I have formed a partnership _ a partnership
for the future, a partnership that will make America first
economically and militarily,'' he said at a San Antonio rally.
``The two go hand in hand. You can't have one without the other and
we'll have neither if we elect George Bush and Dan Quayle to lead
our country.''
   Bush, who like Dukakis has been in California all week,
campaigned Saturday with actors Telly Savalas and Chuck Norris and
singers Mike Love and Bruce Johnston of the Beach Boys.
   He told reporters aboard his campaign plane that he was going to
``go the extra mile to fight hard'' in the final 24 days of the
race and wouldn't ``mess up.''
   ``We're going to take the high road and leave the pessimism and
the tearing down of America to somebody else,'' he said.
   ``Here we go ... entering the home stretch of this national
presidential election,'' Bush declared at a noisy kickoff rally in
an airport hangar in Modesto.
   He is pushing for an advantage in California, where the election
is still considered too close to call. In particular, he is trying
to energize Republicans and to keep the support of Democrats who
may have dropped their allegiance in order to vote for Reagan in
1980 and 1984.
   In Washington, President Reagan used his weekly radio address to
praise Bush, criticize Dukakis and ask voters to support
Republicans in House and Senate races. ``If we don't want a
tax-and-spend liberal in the White House, shouldn't we give the
president a Congress that will work with him?'' he asked.
   Rep. Dennis Eckart of Ohio, giving the Democrats' response, said
Dukakis and Bentsen would do more than the Republicans to answer
Americans' most pressing concerns. He dismissed Bush as ``a silent
partner'' in a Reagan administration ``riddled with corruption,
corruption that has reached into the president's cabinet, to the
Pentagon, from defense contractors to Wall Street.''

   Two masked men in overalls
burst into a pub in east Belfast on Saturday, shooting to death a
Protestant paramilitary leader and another man and wounding four
others, police said.
   Police identified one of the dead men as James Craig, 47, of
Belfast. British television reports named him as a leader in the
Protestant paramilitary Ulster Defense Association.
   The second dead man was identified as Belfast resident George
Raimey, a spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary said.
Raimey's age was unknown.
   No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but suspicion
fell on the Irish Republican Army, which is fighting to end British
rule in Northern Ireland. The mainly Roman Catholic IRA seeks to
unite the predominantly Protestant province with the neighboring
Irish Republic.
   Police said the gunmen, wearing blue overalls, entered the
Castle Inn in the heart of Protestant east Belfast and ordered the
customers to lie on the floor.
   The gunmen then opened fire indiscriminately and fled, the
police said, adding that at least one of the wounded was in
critical condition.
   Members of the Ulster Defense Association have been accused of
taking part in racketeering throughout the province.
   Craig and two other suspects appeared before Belfast Magistrates
Court in 1985 on 33 charges related to extortion of money from
building contractors. However, the charges were later dropped.
   In the last 10 months, two leading members of the Ulster Defense
Association have been slain.
   Vice Chairman John McMichael was killed last Christmas by a
booby trap bomb attached to his car outside his home in Lisburn,
County Antrim. William John Quee was shot to death Sept. 7 outside
his grocery store.
   In the border area near the Irish Republic, meanwhile, police
said a gun and grenade attack was launched on the Royal Ulster
Constabulary station at Lurgan, County Armagh, causing slight
damage but no injuries. There was no immediate claim of
responsibility.

<TEXT>
   U.S.-backed Nicaraguan Resistance
leaders rejected an invitation Saturday to join fellow rebels who
say they are ready to talk about peace with the government and lay
down their arms.
   Those who formed the new Democratic Center coalition are
``pseudo-leaders,'' said Nicaraguan rebel Roberto Ferrey in a
recorded interview. Members of the Nicaraguan Resistance in Miami,
the umbrella group for the rebels or Contras, played it for The
Associated Press in Managua.
   The new coalition of some Nicaraguan Resistance leaders was
announced Friday. At a press conference in Costa Rica, Alfredo
Cesar said the group will propose a Nicaraguan peace plan to the
leftist Sandinista government that will complement a regional plan
proposed by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias.
   However, Ferrey said the Democratic Center coalition is ``a new
effort to trick the rebels which will only help consolidate (the
power of) the Sandinistas.''
   Cesar, a member of the Nicaraguan Resistance directorate and
leader of the Southern Opposition Block, said the Democratic Center
coalition is not breaking away from the Nicaraguan Resistance. He
said it will try to win over other members to its ideas.
   The new group includes four political opposition parties, in
addition to Cesar's Southern Opposition Block.
   However, Ferrey discounted the group's importance.
   ``It acts as infiltrators to undermine the resistance,'' he said.
   One rebel official involved in the coalition said the new group
was formed in part with an eye to the end of the Reagan
administration, which has backed the rebels since 1981 in their bid
to oust the Sandinistas.
   The two sides agreed March 21 to begin a truce, which has been
periodically extended despite complaints of violations from both
sides.
   Talks have remained at an impasse, particularly over the
Sadinista demand that the rebels give up their arms as part of a
permanent peace.

<HEAD>Survey: One In Six Britons Can't Find Own Country on Map</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One in six Britons questioned in a survey couldn't
find his own country on a map, and more than 40 percent had a big
problem figuring a simple restaurant check, a newspaper reported
Sunday.
   One person even thought President Reagan leads Britain's
socialist Labor Party, although 90 percent correctly identified the
opposition leader as Neil Kinnock, the survey found.
   The survey of 994 people, published in The Sunday Times of
London, was conducted last month by Market and Opinion Research
International. The newspaper commissioned it to test knowledge of
geography, mathematics, common foreign language phrases, spelling,
history, science and current affairs.
   The newspaper said the 18-question test was ``simple,'' but
``many of the replies were enough to break traditional teachers'
hearts.''
   The survey found 83 percent of the sample population could find
Britain on a world map, but 7 percent had no idea where to look.
Others placed it off the coast of North America, off South America,
in the Far East or in Africa.
   Asked to spell ``embarrass,'' ``satellite'' and ``exercise,''
one in 10 immediately ``threw up their hands in defeat,'' the
newspaper said.
   Fifty-nine percent spelled ``embarrass'' and ``satellite''
incorrectly, and 28 percent failed ``exercise.''
   Mathematics added to the problem, the newspaper said. Asked to
add menu prices for the total cost of a hamburger, french fries,
apple pie and coffee, 42 percent got it wrong or were unable to try.
   People aged 15-24 fared the worst in the survey, the newspaper
said, and women generally did worse than men, except in spelling.
   Professor David Hargreaves of Cambridge University was quoted as
saying the poor results by young people showed Britain was ``in
danger of producing a generation of ignoramuses.''
   Education Minister Angela Rumbold was quoted as describing the
results as ``most depressing.''
   In July, the Gallup Organization released results of a
geographic literacy test that showed that the Britons polled placed
seventh among the nine countries surveyed. Americans tested
finished sixth in the survey.
   Three out of four Americans in the Gallup survey couldn't locate
the Persian Gulf, most had no idea of the U.S. population and the
majority were lost when it came to finding Britain, France or Japan.

<HEAD>Soviet Communist Says KGB Could Learn Something From FBI</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The KGB secret police could learn from the FBI by
telling Soviet citizens when they are being followed or monitored
by its agents, one Communist Party member says.
   The campaign for ``glasnost,'' or openness on selected topics,
has allowed the publication of some unusual items in Soviet media
recently. But a letter in the latest issue of the Ogonyok weekly is
believed to be the first suggestion to Soviet secret police
officers to look to the West for inspiration.
   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the government reportedly
is working on a new statute regulating the State Security
Committee, or KGB from its Russian-language initials. But the
powerful and secretive agency itself remains virtually above
criticism in the state-run press.
   A. Rachkov of Moscow, who identified himself as a Communist
Party member, wrote to tell the weekly that one of his friends,
Yuri N., started to wonder why he was never sent abroad on business
trips by the government agency he works for.
   When Yuri signed up for a tourist trip to England, the vacation
reservations were canceled two days before departure ``under a
clearly invented pretext,'' Rachkov said.
   Yuri came to believe that someone made a ``slanderous report''
about him to the KGB that ruined his chances of ever traveling
outside the Soviet Union.
   But he had no way of making anyone in authority tell him whether
his belief was true, Rachkov said.
   ``He couldn't penetrate the wall by banging against it with his
head,'' Rachkov said.
   By contrast, the Muscovite wrote, a recent Soviet press report
said an American who thought he was being followed by the FBI sent
the bureau an official request to explain its actions.
   ``After a time, he received a reply containing an official
notice that a file had been opened about his `anti-American
activities,''' Rachkov said.
   ``Maybe I'm mistaken, but it seems to me that this is a proof of
democratization,'' the Soviet wrote.
   ``Moreover, I'd like to suggest that the KGB legalize in this
country, too, the same possibility of sending a formal request to
the (government) organs, so that a citizen of the U.S.S.R. could
protect himself, if necessary, against false reports and arbitrary
sanctions.''

   Vandals bombed and destroyed a statue
of U.S. Gen. Douglas MacArthur on an island where he led Allied
troops retaking the Philippines from Japan during World War II,
police said Sunday.
   The 10-foot statue of marble, granite and cement fell to the
ground face down. Most of it was blasted to pieces by the explosive
device, which police had not identified.
   The bombing occurred before dawn Saturday at Palo town on the
central island of Leyte, about 350 miles from Manila. The
Philippine Daily Inquirer reported that the blast was heard more
than seven miles away.
   The statue was one of six erected in 1976 on the shores of Palo
to commemorate the Leyte landing, but only MacArthur's statue was
damaged.
   The bombing occurred five days before the 44th anniversary of
the landing of Allied forces he commanded. Their return fulfilled
the famous pledge ``I shall return,'' which MacArthur made to
Filipinos when his troops fled Japanese attackers at the beginning
of the war.
   No suspects were caught in the bombing, and no motive was
discovered.
   However, the island is a stronghold of communist rebels who have
been fighting the national government for two decades.

   Rival Moslem militias fired mortars,
rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns in a five-hour clash in
which six people died and 25 others were wounded, police said
Sunday.
   They said Saturday night's firefight between Syrian-backed Amal
militia and militants of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah _ the first
major clash between the two groups in nearly five months _ ignited
blazes in numerous apartment buildings in south Beirut.
   A police spokesman said on condition of anonymity that Syrian
soldiers deployed in densely populated districts of Ghobeiri and
Shiyah stopped the fighting.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God; and Amal, Arabic for Hope, have been
vying for dominance of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the nation's
largest sect.
   Syria stationed troops to the devastated suburbs on May 27 to
put an end to a three-week bloody confrontation between the two
militias in which nearly 300 people were killed and 1,000 wounded.
   It was not immediately known what set off the clash. Each side
accused the other of starting it.
   The conservative Ad-Diyar daily quoted an Amal source as saying
Hezbollah militants kidnapped five members of Amal and released
them several hours later after beating them. The source said two
were hospitalized with various injuries.
   The same newspaper, based in Christian east Beirut, quoted
Hezbollah sources as saying the fighting erupted when Hezbollah
militants tried to prevent Amal militiamen from raiding an
apartment belonging to Hezbollah ``sympathizers,'' claiming they
wanted to search the flat.
   The Hezbollah sources said the Amal fighters fired a rocket into
the apartment when the Hezbollahis tried to defend themselves, the
newspaper said.
   There was no way to confirm either report.

   The People's Daily newspaper said the survivors managed to climb

   The vehicle's official capacity was 38 people, the report said.
   The bus crashed Wednesday in a rural area of Shaanxi province in

   It said the driver, He Guangbi, was driving fast in rain without

   Emperor Hirohito remained in stable condition
Sunday, but doctors were concerned about his anemia and jaundice,
palace officials said.
   Imperial Household spokesman Kenji Maeda quoted palace doctors
as saying the 87-year-old emperor discharged a small amount of
blood Sunday morning.
   The emperor's temperature was 99.5 Sunday night, the palace
said. His normal temperature is 95.9.
   Doctors gave Hirohito another .84 pint of blood, bringing the
total he has received since he fell seriously ill last month to
17.4 pints.
   An Imperial Household source said on condition of anonymity that
physicians were worried about Hirohito's worsening anemia and
jaundice, but he declined to elaborate.
   Two doctors and three nurses have kept a round-the-clock watch
over the world's longest reigning living monarch since he vomited
blood Sept. 19.
   News reports Sunday said nurses have been massaging Hirohito's
legs and arms daily to relieve a dull feeling he has complained of
since last week.
   Kyodo News Service quoted palace sources as saying the emperor
has received guests with his eyes closed.

   A man whose pickup sported a bumper sticker
with an unmentionable four-letter word was chased by police and
charged with violating Florida's new law banning obscene stickers.
   Glenn Wallace Beasley, 25, remained in jail Sunday, five days
later, unable to post $3,325 bail on charges of fleeing and
attempting to elude police and violating probation. He is scheduled
to appear in county court Tuesday.
   Sheriff's deputy Jorge Morera tried to pull over Beasley's truck
on Tuesday after seeing stickers on his bumper. One sticker read
``Life's a Beach,'' another had the four-letter word.
   The driver sped off and jumped out of his pickup at a dead-end
street, Morera said. Police found him hours later hiding along the
beach.
   Having an obscene bumper sticker or decal is a second-degree
misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and a $500 fine.

D'Alessandro said of the law that became effective Oct. 1.

<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Chadli Bendjedid ordered the
release on Sunday of about 500 minors arrested in a week of rioting
over the worsening economy, the government announced.
   In addition, the president suspended all hearings before the
special courts set up to try the youths, most of whom were arrested
for looting and acts of vandalism during the unrest that began Oct.
4.
   The government has said 180 people died in the rioting, but
unofficials reports said at least 500 people died and more than
1,000 were injured.
   The government also ordered the release Sunday of all those
imprisoned during the unrest who were not directly involved in the
revolt and those ``arrested for crimes of opinion.''
   More than 3,000 people were reported arrested in Algiers and
provincial cities during the riots over shortages, high food prices
and the government's program of austerity and economic reform.
   Schools reopened Saturday, and the country was relatively calm.
   Those still held in prison will ``benefit fully of the rights of
defense in accordance with the law,'' the government said. ``No
judgment will be pronounced other than in the strict respect of
legality.''
   Miloud Brahimi, the president of Algeria's League for Human
Rights, last week protested the special tribunals, which he charged
with violating the fundamental rights of presumed innocence.
   Also on Sunday, Interior Minister El-Hadi Khediri announced a
nationwide revision of electoral lists as a first step to the Nov.
3 referendum that is to launch Bendjedid's program to democratize
his country.
   In the referendum, the citizens will be asked to approve a
revision of the constitution that would make the future prime
minister answerable to Parliament. Other, more far-reaching reforms
are to be discussed in December at the national congress of the
ruling National Liberation Front.
   No one except foreign-based opposition groups has publicly
proposed the introduction of a multiparty system.
   The official Algerie Presse Service said the referendum
``introduces the fundamental problem of the full participation in
the political life of the country for all citizens.''
   The news agency said the reforms to be introduced would permit
the removal of top officials ``who have impeded the changes by
inertia or incompetence.''
   One of the likely victims of these changes is the leader of the
National Liberation Front, Mohamed Cherif Messaadia, who has not
been heard from publicly for nearly two weeks. Many other personnel
changes are expected in the government, including the possible
replacement of Prime Minister Abdelhamid Brahimi.

<TEXT>
   It's been a down-and-dirty presidential
campaign, from gleeful Democratic denunciations of George Bush as a
wimp to the Republicans' skewering of Michael Dukakis over crime,
the ACLU and the Pledge of Allegiance.
   While the dismal tenor of this year's campaign discourse has
elicited groans from past presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy
Carter, political analysts credit Bush with tapping some of the
same emotional issues that helped Nixon capture the White House in
1968 and 1972 and laid the groundwork for Ronald Reagan's twin
landslides of the 1980s.
   Some experts say it is a serious mistake for the Democrats, who
have lost four of the past five presidential elections, to
underestimate the seriousness with which the electorate responds to
emotional appeals to its patriotism or fear of crime.
   The gut issues, symbolic or not, are real issues for many voters.
   ``Politics is a matter of gut responses, otherwise known as
emotions,'' said Roger D. Masters, a Dartmouth University professor
of government.
   ``It's not just media manipulation,'' said Michael Robinson, a
Georgetown University associate professor of government and expert
on media and politics. ``If the Democrats continue to believe that
symbolic issues don't matter, they're going to foul up time and
time again.''
   Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said
symbolic issues loom larger in this election because ``American
politics, like nature, abhors a vacuum. The candidates seemed quite
deliberately to choose not to face up to the pragmatic issues.''
   Robinson said the race unfolded during a time of economic
prosperity when there were few differences between Democrats and
Republicans on dealing with the Soviet Union.
   ``When you subtract the issues of peace and prosperity, you
leave very little, so we are left to fight on those gut isues of
symbolic issues,'' he said.
   Conservative analyst Kevin Phillips, publisher of the American
Political Report, said, ``The Republicans have replayed the key
cultural and patriotic issues with the swing voters that got the
Republican presidential majority started in 1968 and 1972 and
1980.''
   The Bush campaign flogged the crime spree of Willie Horton Jr.,
the Massachusetts lifer who escaped while on a weekend furlough
from prison, and pummeled Dukakis for being a self-proclaimed,
card-carrying member of the American Civil Liberties Union.
   In doing so, Phillips said, Bush's people succeeded in
rekindling in the minds of wavering Reagan Democrats the emotions
that ``pulled them to vote for Republican presidents in earlier
years,'' while Dukakis failed to develop rival issues to appeal to
the same swing voters.
   In their final debate last Thursday, both candidates sounded
apologetic about the low-road campaigning. Bush, recalling the
almost non-stop attacks the Democrats unleashed against him at
their July convention in Atlanta, said, ``I don't want to sound
like a kid in the schoolyard (but) he started it.''
   ``It was both ways,'' said Ben Wattenberg, a senior fellow at
the American Enterprise Institute. ``Two months ago, the best issue
that Dukakis had on Bush was `wimp' and the best issue Bush had on
Dukakis was `L-word' (liberal).''
   The Republicans ``went after Dukakis on all the L-word stuff,
which they had some nice symbols for _ prison furloughs and Pledge
of Allegiance and ACLU and stuff like that. But it wasn't about
those issues,'' said Wattenberg, a Democrat.
   ``The reason they played was because they resonated in terms of
20 years of Democratic Party history as too liberal,'' he said.
``It's not a small issue. It is haunting this party. It is which
direction the plurality party in America wants to take the
country.''
   On the other hand, the Democrats' wimp charge quickly lost its
punch as Bush emerged from the GOP convention in New Orleans as
``Captain Marvel,'' said Wattenberg.
   Phillips said, ``By going hard-line on the cultural and
patriotic issues, Bush drove down the wimp factor. ... Bush put on
a bit of a John Wayne outfit.''
   Bush's highest negative rating in polls remains the perception
that he is too close to the wealthy and too far from the middle
class. But Phillips said Dukakis failed to ``come on hard and tough
and use economic populism and nationalism to get the guys in the
bar in the ethnic sections of Cleveland or your dirt farmer in
rural Alabama angry at the Republicans.''
   Robinson said, ``In a time of real prosperity, questions of
economic justice and hostility toward big business do not cut it
with the American public.''
   As for such emotional issues as flag and country, ``you can't
pretend that something that is an issue is not an issue,'' Robinson
said. ``It hurts the Democrats when they try to dismiss this in
some way as bigotry or tasteless or un-American.''
   ``It is an issue to Americans whether you wear your flag on your
sleeve or whether you wear it on the seat of your pants,'' he said.
   ``Republicans are not only willing to wear their flag on their
sleeves, they're willing to wear it on their foreheads. The
Democrats are willing to move it off their keester, but they still
want to keep it half covered, and Americans don't like that.''

<HEAD>NRA Slamming Dukakis in Radio Ads He Says Are `Outrageous
Distortion'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

   The National Rifle Association is saturating
more than a dozen states with radio commercials slamming Michael
Dukakis' record on crime and guns as ``up-North nonsense'' that
shouldn't spread beyond his native Massachusetts.
   Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee, says the
advertisements are an ``outrageous distortion'' of his positions.
His campaign has asked the gun lobby to pull them, and is
counter-attacking with its own radio and TV ads.
   Daniel A. Taylor, general counsel for the Dukakis campaign, told
the NRA by letter that it was wrongly attributing statements to
Dukakis and ignoring an issues questionnaire the governor had
filled out, according to campaign spokeswoman Lorraine Voles.
   But Wayne La Pierre, director of the NRA's lobbying arm, said
the ads were factual. He accused the Dukakis campaign of ``a
heavy-handed attempt to keep us from relaying the truth.''
   The NRA started running the radio spots a week ago in Texas,
California, North Carolina, Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Arkansas
and Montana, among other states.
   ``We're covering those states from one end to the other _
probably thousands of stations,'' said La Pierre. He declined to
say how much the NRA had spent on the radio ads or on a companion
direct-mail campaign.
   La Pierre said ``there is tremendous support for gun ownership
and hunting'' in the target states. ``Dukakis' strident position as
governor ... could very well cost him those states. He's making a
last-ditch, desperate attempt to say he's really pro-sportsmen and
pro-firearms ownership,'' he said.
   Dukakis tried to defuse the NRA ads last weekend before they
began, calling them ``another outrageous distortion of what I
believe.''
   His campaign is counter-attacking with its own radio ads and, in
Texas, with two television ads on the crime and gun control records
of Republican nominee George Bush.
   The NRA, operating independently of the Bush campaign, is
running three 60-second radio spots. One quotes Dukakis as saying
he was ``going to do everything I can to disarm this state.'' The
NRA narrator says, ``Don't let this up-North nonsense go
nationwide.''
   Another NRA spot features actor Charlton Heston, who says
Dukakis ``opposed mandatory jail time for drug pushers, vetoed the
death penalty for cop killers, gave murderers weekend vacations
from prison. He also did everything he could to take guns away from
honest citizens. ... Michael Dukakis is not just challenging your
rights. He's taking on the Constitution.''
   Another ad is aimed at Pennsylvanians. A ``sportsman'' says he
loves the Pennsylvania woods and accuses Dukakis of raiding his
state's conservation fund to pay off state debt. ``Protect our
outdoor heritage. Defeat Dukakis,'' an announcer concludes.
   In his letter, Taylor said Dukakis has denied ever saying he was
going to try to disarm his state. He also said Dukakis had
completed a questionnaire for the NRA in which he said he supported
firearm ownership for personal protection, hunting, competitive
shooting, informal sport shooting and collecting.
   ``He did support a ban on `Saturday night specials','' Taylor
said.
   One of the Dukakis TV spots running in Texas says only one
candidate for president has voted for federal gun control _ George
Bush. The ad cites a Bush vote as a congressman and adds, ``Mike
Dukakis supports gun ownership by hunters and sportsmen. Don't be
confused.''
   Dukakis' other Texas TV ad says ``George Bush sat by while a
federal furlough program released thousands of prisoners, many of
them drug dealers _ almost 14,000 in 1987 alone. And now suddenly
George Bush is attacking Michael Dukakis for just one case in his
furlough program. But Michael Dukakis took action and changed that
program, in his state he's reduced crime by 13 percent and the
murder rate is the lowest of any major industrial state.''

<HEAD>Congress Aims To Finish Campaign-Year Bills; Leave Town</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 100th Congress, running behind schedule,
is trying to finish work this week on election-year bills dealing
with drugs and taxes so members can return home to campaign.
   Some legislators were so itchy to leave town that on Friday they
sported buttons reading, ``Free the 100th.''
   ``I certainly would hope we wouldn't have to stay beyond
Wednesday. But nobody can predict that,'' said Senate Majority
Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.
   Congress originally aimed to quit Sept. 30, but bogged down in a
fight over the anti-drug package. The Senate finally passed its
$2.6 billion version on Friday.
   The bill calls for the death penalty for drug traffickers who
murder, funnels more money to treatment programs and creates a new,
Cabinet-level drug ``czar'' to coordinate the federal government's
anti-drug effort.
   ``This has taken more time than we expected, but it was very
complicated and a lot of issues had to be considered,'' said Sen.
Sam Nunn, D-Ga., one of the chief authors of the anti-drug package.
   The House passed its drug bill Sept. 22. Senators hope House
members will accept some version of the Senate legislation rather
than appointing a House-Senate conference committee.
   ``If we have a conference, we'll be here until Thanksgiving,''
said Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H. ``We wrote our bill with an eye
toward language the House might accept.''
   Election-year demands from voters to do something about drugs
have driven the bill, Rudman said. ``People want us to respond,
they want leadership from the Congress.''
   Also unfinished is a compromise tax bill, but House-Senate
negotiations broke off in disagreement Friday, imperiling chances
of reaching a plan both chambers can accept.
   The measure includes a package of corrections to the landmark
1986 tax law, some new tax cuts along with other tax increases to
offset the reductions, and a taxpayer ``bill of rights'' for
persons facing Internal Revenue Service enforcement actions.
   The House plan raises taxes between $7 billion and $7.5 billion
over the next three years, compared to the price tag of just under
$3 billion for the Senate package.
   Senate negotiators proposed a compromise $3 billion package, the
House responded Friday with a $4.5 billion counter, the Senate side
turned that plan down, and the talks stalled.
   ``We have not selected the pallbearers yet,'' said Sen. Max
Baucus, D-Mont., head of the Senate negotiating team. He said the
two sides would try to talk again Monday.
   Also pending on the legislative agenda are a variety of other
bills, including one that would elevate the Veterans Administration
to Cabinet-level status. The House approved that bill Oct. 6.
   Supporters of the legislation say upgrading the agency's status
will give the nation's 27 million veterans direct access to the
White House. It would be the government's 14th Cabinet department.
   When the House meets Tuesday, one of its first votes will be on
a bill requiring full disclosure of credit card information to
consumers. The Senate, which returns to work on Monday, passed the
bill last week.
   The proposal requires banks, department stores and other firms
which offer credit cards to tell consumers about annual fees,
interest rates, late fees and other information. Only a few states
now have laws requiring public disclosure of such information
before consumers receive the cards.
   Another piece of unfinished business is legislation providing
the first-ever restrictions on lobbying by former members of
Congress, a plan that is part of a general tightening of federal
rules against influence peddling by top government officials.
   Differing versions of the legislation have passed each chamber
and the discrepancies must be worked out before it can win final
approval.

<HEAD>US Seeks To Block Pol Pot's Return To Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State Department officials engaged in quiet
discussions last week about a man who, although unseen by the
outside world for nine years, is at the heart of a diplomatic
debate over one of the world's most unfortunate countries.
   He is Pol Pot, whose 3{-year rule in Cambodia during the late
1970's led to the slaughter of perhaps 2 million of his countrymen
before he and his Khmer Rouge allies were driven out by Vietnamese
invaders.
   David Hawk, an authority on the Khmer Rouge, says Pol Pot is
believed to be operating out of a small town in Thailand near the
Cambodian border, plotting a return to power once the Vietnamese
carry out their stated intention to withdraw from Cambodia in 1990.
   Hawk has written on Cambodia for Freedom House, a New York-based
human rights group, and formerly worked for Amnesty International.
   The Reagan administration has been using diplomatic pressure to
encourage the Vietnamese to fulfill their promise to withdraw but
is trying to find a way to prevent the Marxist Khmer Rouge from
retaking power once that happens.
   This issue is a major concern of pro-western countries in
Southeast Asia and was discussed this past week during a visits to
Washington by former Cambodian head of state Prince Norodom
Sihanouk and officials from the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
   The dilemma facing the administration is that the Khmer Rouge,
with help from China, is by far the strongest of the three rebel
groups fighting the Vietnamese occupation forces. The United States
is providing non-lethal equipment to the other two groups _ one led
by Sihanouk, the second by former Prime Minister Son Sann.
   Sihanouk told reporters Wednesday that his solution is the
formation of a national reconciliation government after the
Vietnamese forces leave. Khmer Rouge ``moderates'' would be allowed
a role, while Pol Pot and other top leaders would be sent into
exile, possibly China, he said.
   The Khmer Rouge, meanwhile, insist they recognize their past
excesses and have now become ``liberal capitalists.''
   Hawk says Khmer Rouge actions at the refugee camps they run
along the Thai-Cambodian border suggest little has changed since
their 1975-78 period in power.
   ``All evidence points to the fact they are the same as they
were,'' Hawk says.
   ``If you look at treatment of civilians under their control in
resistance base areas in Thailand, their basic pattern of rule by
terror and denial of human rights is still present.''
   Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., said in a speech last month that
China and, to a lesser degree, the Reagan administration, bear
responsibility for the continued existence of the Khmer Rouge as an
effective fighting force.
   ``Ten years ago, the Khmer Rouge were all but dead,'' Hatfield
said. ``But because of questionable regional strategies and the
self-imposed silence of the American government, the Khmer Rouge
beast was nursed back to health by Communist China, and now the
resolution strategy for Cambodia has to deal with the fact that the
Khmer Rouge are poised to return to their old ways of torturing and
terrorizing the people of Cambodia.''
   China sees Cambodia as a strategic issue. Worried about
encirclement by pro-Soviet countries, including Cambodia, China's
highest priority is to hasten Vietnam's withdrawal from that
country by assisting the Khmer Rouge.
   The degree to which the Khmer Rouge engaged in terror was
outlined in a book written by a survivor of the Khmer Rouge rule.
Writing under her adopted name in ``The Stones Cry Out,'' Molyda
Szymusiak recalled the inhumanity of that era:
   ``It has rained over the past few days, and the ground is so
soft that corpses not buried deep enough are rising up out of the
earth ... I start praying as I walk along.''
   In an article in a 1987 issue of Commentary Magazine, Arch
Puddington quoted a United Nations Human Rights Commission official
as saying that the Khmer Rouge atrocities ``were the most serious
committed in the world since Naziism.''
   Puddington wrote that one of the most important objectives of
Khmer Rouge training was to infuse young cadres with ``a
callousness toward violence, pain and killing.
   ``A key technique was the torture game. Animals, including
domestic animals like dogs and monkeys, were systematically
dismembered or burned by children-soldiers.''
   Sihanouk himself, who was under house arrest in Cambodia during
the Khmer Rouge era, once recorded his own reaction after
witnessing these activities.
   ``The screams of the poor beasts were heart rending,'' he wrote.
``The sights and sounds of them were unbearable. But the Khmer
Rouge youths couldn't get enough of it.''

   For Forest Whitaker, playing Charlie Parker
didn't just mean looking or sounding like the great jazzman. It
meant making sure everything fit.
   ``I was nervous. I was scared,'' admitted Whitaker, who stars in
``Bird,'' Clint Eastwood's critically acclaimed film biography of
the late jazz saxophonist.
   ``I was going into areas I hadn't really dealt with. It was a
most challenging role. As a person, I felt really honored to bring
the character to life. It was so fortunate that it happened.''
   Parker, who died in 1955 when he was just 34, moved into musical
areas that few touched. With such musicians as Dizzy Gillespie, he
revolutionized jazz in the 1940s, helping create the style called
be-bop. A brilliant and troubled man, he was no less overwhelming
as a person.
   ``I think he embraced life,'' Whitaker said. ``He took whatever
pleasure he could find in it. He wasn't afraid to do that. It held
a lot of bad consequences for him, but he did that and that's where
he hurt himself.''
   Where Parker primarily hurt himself was by a heroin addiction
that plagued him for much of his life.
   ``He was trapped and he started very young,'' Whitaker said. ``I
think it has to do with his particular way of life. He was very
sensitive about a lot of things. I think he knew it was destroying
him. He didn't want other people using it.''
   Whitaker, awarded this year's prize for best actor at the Cannes
Film Festival, gives a performance that should get Academy notice.
   He was born in Longview, Texas, and grew up in Los Angeles. He
attended the University of Southern California and originally
studied opera. But he became interested in acting and began
appearing in local equity productions. His involvement with movies
came later.
   ``I was probably going to go to New York and work on stage and
that was it,'' Whitaker said in an interview. ``It just so happens
I was working on a play and it turned into an opportunity to do a
film.''
   Whitaker beat Paul Newman at pool in ``The Color of Money,'' and
played Robin Williams' protege in ``Good Morning, Vietnam.'' He has
been directed by Martin Scorsese, Oliver Stone and Eastwood.
   ``They all have a very keen sense of focus, although their
focuses are different. Some go out in a circle and encompass
everything. Some just focus on this little tiny thing.''
   Whitaker had not even met Eastwood when he was given the part.
   ``I didn't know he had any interest in jazz whatsoever. I didn't
have any preconceived ideas about him. I never expected to see
Dirty Harry walk into that meeting. He turned out to be a real jazz
aficionado and really easy to work for.''
   Whitaker is something of a rarity in Hollywood, a successful
black actor. He had always been aware of the difficulties in
getting good parts, but was not deterred from going into films.
   ``I'm fortunate because I never wanted to do film. I'm real
fortunate that I never really thought about it. That fear wasn't
there because there wasn't a great need at first,'' he said. ``A
lot of the roles I've played have not been written for black
actors.''
   As part of his research for ``Bird,'' Whitaker talked to those
who knew Parker, including the jazzman's wife, Chan. He discovered
that no one really ``knew'' Parker.
   ``It seemed they didn't know what was going on with him. That
helped me immensely to understand where he was coming from,''
Whitaker said.
   ``What did he really say to them? What did they really know
about his fears, how he felt about this? When they told me what
they knew, it was more important what they didn't know. Someone
would say he had no fear and that would tell me how much they
knew.''
   Parker was true to the spirit of his music, spontaneous and
emotional, given to extreme highs and lows. Understandably,
Whitaker was drained by the effort to sustain those feelings.
   ``There are scenes in the latter part of his life when he's
closer to death, when he's lost almost everything. He's walking
around like a lost soul, the only thing that's moving him around is
a little pilot light,'' the actor said.
   ``That was difficult to understand, trying to find that place
where you're still alive but you have nothing left.''
   But how well could anyone really understand Parker? ``Bird has
disentegrated into pure sound,'' a musician once said. Was Parker
beyond words?
   ``He was pushing towards sound,'' Whitaker said. ``The sound was
totally coming from emotion. More than words can express. I think
that was something he felt, understood and put in his music.''
   But Whitaker believes he shares an important philosophical goal
with Parker.
   ``I think he had a quest for understanding, openness. I believe
I have that, trying to figure that stuff out, being open to all
kinds of different things.

   Thieves who stole eight snakes from the Dallas zoo
picked the most valuable snakes and the easiest to handle,
authorities said.
   The snakes, worth about $8,000, were reported missing Saturday
morning. Workers found no sign of forced entry at the Bird and
Reptile Building and lids still covered the snakes' cages, some of
which were found latched, suggesting the snakes did not escape.
   ``The thing is it's just these specific snakes that were
taken,'' said Victoria Furber, zoo spokeswoman. ``We figure that
somebody knew what they were doing and just went after some of the
most valuable snakes in that section.''
   Gone were three ringed pythons, three carpet pythons and two
endangered Dumeril's ground boas.
   Ardell Mitchell, animal care manager for the zoo's reptile
department, said the snakes probably were taken for resale to
underground pet traders or collectors.
   ``These little snakes that were taken may bite, but it wouldn't
hurt at all. So they took the easy ones to handle,'' Mitchell said.
The stolen snakes were between 2 and 3 feet long.
   The loss of the boas, which were brother and sister, especially
worried zoo officials, Ms. Furber said. The snakes came from
Madagascar and are listed as an endangered species because their
forest habitat is being destroyed.
   ``They're pretty valuable animals,'' Mitchell said. ``I'd hate
for them to go off and sit in someone's garage somewhere.''

<HEAD>Congress Moves To Tighten Up Safety At Nuclear Weapons Reactors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress, disturbed by evidence the Energy
Department has mismanaged nuclear weapons reactors, has passed a
law to put them under standards nearly as stringent as those
applied to reactors used to produce electricity.
   Some lawmakers, however, believe even tougher legislation is
needed in the wake of the Energy Department's acknowledgement that
its aging reactors at the Savannah River Plant near Aiken, S.C.,
have experienced problems and that other plants have spewed
radioactivity into the environment.
   ``The main difficulty is that the Department of Energy has been
its own policeman,'' said Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., one of the
authors of a bill passed in September creating the Defense Nuclear
Facilities Board to monitor the operation of weapons reactors.
   The board, yet to be appointed by the president, has the
authority to inspect the facilities at which the Energy Department
manufactures nuclear weapons for the Pentagon.
   It will make recommendations to the secretary of energy, the
president and to Congress, but it will not have the power to close
down facilities which are operating unsafely.
   In the past, the need to maintain a nuclear deterrent has
overridden concern over the environmental hazards posed by weapons
reactors.
   Finding a means to balance those concerns will be expensive. The
cost of building a new generation of safer nuclear weapons reactors
is between $3.2 billion and $6.8 billion, Energy Department
officials say.
   And it is expected to cost more than $110 billion to clean up
contamination from the reactors at the Savannah River Plant and
other facilities near Cincinnati, Ohio, and Golden, Colo.
   ``We quantified that as best we could, the tens of tens and tens
and tens of million dollars that this government, this department,
has to address in the future if it would in fact meet what we
believe is a moral obligation to rectify past sins,'' Deputy Energy
Secretary Joseph Salgado told reporters.
   Salgado and other department officials say they are delaying
until early next year the reopening of the first of three reactors
at the Savannah River Plant, where they manufacture nuclear weapons
materials for the Pentagon.
   And they announced the appointment of an extra layer of managers
at the site to draft safer operating procedures for the start-up.
By the end of next year, they said, all three reactors at the
Savannah River Plant should be in operation.
   Meantime, Richard E. Heckert, chairman of the E.I. du Pont de
Nemours & Co., which operates Savannah River, said the government
has exaggerated the problems with the nuclear facility.
   ``The plant is not in disarray,'' Heckert said in an interview
with The New York Times. ``These facilities are safe, will work and
will produce and meet the nation's requirements. The operators are
well qualified and well trained.''
   Du Pont, which has been operating the Savannah River facility
since 1950, has opted to let its contract lapse. The plant will be
taken over by Westinghouse Electric Co. on April 1. Heckert claimed
the government wants to criticize the plant so that Westinghouse
will look good in comparison when it begins operations next year.
   Pentagon officials say national security could be endangered by
a prolonged delay in manufacturing one of the materials, tritium, a
radioactive isotope of hydrogen, which boosts the power and
efficiency of nuclear weapons.
   Members of Congress are warning, however, that they want prior
assurances about safety procedures before production resumes at
Savannah River. And some lawmakers may demand the Energy Department
boost expenditures to clean up past contamination.
   One idea circulating on Capitol Hill is to require that Energy
Department reactors be monitored by the Advisory Committee on
Nuclear Safety, an adjunct to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
which licenses civilian atomic plants.
   A panel of the National Academy of Sciences also recommended, in
a report released in March 1987, that the Energy Department operate
under standards as strict as those of the NRC.
   But even some of the staunchest advocates of nuclear safety say
that may not be the best immediate solution. Although the NRC has
years of experience with reactors used by utilities, it has little
with reactors used in making nuclear weapons materials, said John
Ahearne.
   Ahearne, a former NRC chairman who is head of the Energy
Department's independent Advisory Committee for Nuclear Facilities
Safety, said it could take four or five years to draw up a set of
requirements for weapons reactors that would be as detailed those
developed for civilian reactors.
   ``However, some of the NRC criteria can be applied,'' he said.
``The first criteria is that the plant should be constructed and
operated in such a way as it does not release radioactivity.
Production goals should not be the first criteria.''
   Until those standards are worked out in more detail, and until
the Defense Nuclear Facilities Board is appointed and hires its
authorized 100 employees, members of Congress say they will oversee
the safety of Energy Department reactors.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, chairman of the Governmental Operations
Committee, and Rep. Mickey Synar, chairman of the House Government
Operations subcommittee on Environment, Energy and Natural
Resources, have vowed to key a close eye on efforts to restart the
facility.

   President Reagan's no-holds-barred campaign on
behalf of Republican nominee George Bush was partly inspired by the
lessons of Richard Nixon's loss in the 1960 election, says one of
Reagan's closest aides.
   White House chief of staff Kenneth M. Duberstein said that
``Nixon and I spoke several months ago, and I asked him to give his
historical perspective _ what (President Dwight) Eisenhower did and
didn't do for him.''
   It isn't known how much 1988 campaign strategy figured late last
summer when Reagan invited Nixon to the White House for dinner. But
history shows that Eisenhower did little to help his vice
president, which embittered Nixon, who narrowly lost the 1960
election to John F. Kennedy.
   After remaining steadfastly neutral in the Republican primaries
this year, Reagan has steadily increased his role as Vice President
Bush's celebrity surrogate in the campaign against Democrat Michael
Dukakis.
   Reagan has left no doubt in anyone's mind _ as Eisenhower did _
on his feelings about his vice president.
   Reagan mentions Bush's name in official statements whenever he
can. Last Friday, for instance, he sought to give Bush some credit
for the successful flight of the space shuttle Discovery and for
enactment of legislation intended to lessen American reliance on
gasoline as a motor vehicle fuel.
   The president has worked Bush's name into ceremonial bill
signings that otherwise were bipartisan events, such as the recent
signing of a fair housing bill which congressional Democratic
sponsors attended.
   Reagan has hit the road to campaign for Bush among so-called
Reagan Democrats, conservative-minded Democrats in key states who
helped elect the president in 1980 and 1984.
   ``I think it's fair to say that Ronald Reagan has campaigned for
his vice president in an unprecedented manner,'' Duberstein said in
a recent interview.
   ``I think the president's thriving. He's enjoying himself. He
thinks he's making a difference.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan is enjoying
his campaign role ``at a time when people said he was a lame duck
and had no authority.''
   It remains to be seen how much Reagan's aggressive campaigning
will benefit Bush. The president hasn't always demonstrated an
ability to transfer his personal popularity to others. He was
unable to prevent the Democrats from seizing control of the Senate
in 1986, even though he campaigned vigorously for GOP candidates
that year.
   ``If Ronald Reagan goes out and says, `This guy is a bad guy and
this guy is a good guy,' is that going to move those people? Who
knows?'' said Republican consultant Eddie Mahe.
   Yet, campaign aides say Reagan's speeches amount to a powerful
``reinforcing mechanism'' for Bush's campaign messages. This
happened recently when Reagan went into ethnic strongholds of
Chicago to urge Bush's election a couple of days after the vice
president had campaigned there.
   In the past three weeks, the president has visited Illinois,
Michigan, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and he'll take his
peace-and-prosperity pitch into Ohio in the coming week.
   Reagan's standard stump speech argues that Bush will safeguard
conservative gains of the past eight years against a threat from
liberal Democrats to raise taxes and weaken the national defense.
   Republican strategists initially envisioned using Reagan mostly
in the South and the Sun Belt and, of course, in his home state of
California. But as Bush's strengthen solidified in those regions,
Reagan concentrated instead on other, more closely fought swing
states in the Midwest and Northeast.
   Reagan's value to the Bush campaign has soared as troublesome
issues, such as the Iran-Contra affair and ethics questions
centering on former Attorney General Edwin Meese III faded into the
background as time passed.
   ``They have had a marvelous campaign in which they have
integrated the message themes very well,'' said Democratic
consultant Robert Keefe.
   Mahe said it is ``just right'' to redirect Reagan's appearances
where they might count the most.
   ``You're sending your biggest guns into the biggest battles,''
he said. ``There's no surrogate bigger than Ronald Reagan.''

   Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi says
peace negotiations to remove Cuban soldiers from Angola and
establish independence for South-West Africa are at a difficult but
irreversible stage.
   ``I don't see how the process can be interrupted. It can only be
expedited. I don'ock can be turned back,'' Savimbi
said Friday in an interview at a supply camp for his National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola, known as UNITA.
   Under a U.S.-mediated peace accord among Angola, Cuba and South
Africa, more than 50,000 Cubt see how the clan troops supporting Angola's
Marxist
regime are expected to withdraw within two years.
   Savimbi said all but 5,000 troops should pull out in the first
year.
   The four nations also have been negotiating the withdrawal of
South African troops from South-West Africa, also known as Namibia,
which is to gain its independence.
   The discussions _ which have excluded UNITA _ are to resume in
about a week in Brazzaville, Congo, to meet a Nov. 1 target date
for implementing a U.N. independence plan for Namibia.
   Savimbi said he has conferred separately with both U.S. and
South African representatives.
   Savimbi moves elusively through the bush, rarely spending more
than one night in a place. He was interviewedill go toward construction
of a $2.5 million memorial
to New Jersey veterans.

   Pope John Paul II celebrated his 10th
anniversary as pope Sunday by beatifying three 19th century priests
during a Mass in St. Peter's Square.
   The pope said the Mass before 28 cardinals, 50 bishops and about
20,000 other people in the huge square at the foot of the steps to
St. Peter's Basilica.
   The three beatified by the Roman Catholic Church on Sunday were
the Rev. Venceslao Kozminiski, a Polish priest who founded 20
religious orders and associations; the Rev. Bernardo Maria
Silvestrelli, an Italian who headed the Passionist order for 25
years; and the Rev. Carlo Houben, a Dutchman who worked as a
missionary in England and Ireland.
   Beatification is a step toward possible sainthood.
   The ceremony came on the anniversary of the day 10 years ago
when John Paul became the surprise choice of the conclave to
succeed Pope John Paul I, who died after just 33 days on the throne
of St. Peter's.
   Before the Mass began, Cardinal Angelo Rossi, the dean of the
College of Cardinals, congratulated the pope on behalf of all the
cardinals.
   The cardinal noted that during the past decade the pope has made
40 trips to 73 countries, made 74 trips within Italy, wrote seven
encyclicals and has proclaimed 247 saints and beatified 311 people.
   John Paul did not mention his anniversary during his homily, but
afterward thanked the cardinals, bishops and the pilgrims for their
good wishes.

<TEXT>
   A flood has severely damaged one of
the world's greatest ancient cities, and the Libyan government has
appealed for help in repairing the ruins of the once-glorious Roman
metropolis.
   A torrent of water rushed over Leptis Magna, about 75 miles east
of Tripoli, in November after several days of heavy rains sent
water over a dam three miles from the ancient trading center on the
Mediterranean coast.
   For three days, the rampaging river carried tons of dirt and
uprooted vegetation through the ruins, leaving mud yards deep in
such remarkable areas as the Roman Emperor Hadrian's baths and one
of two forums.
   Most heavily damaged was the Colonnaded Street, a 400-yard-long
road on which visitors strolled from the bath complex to the
ancient port. Much of the stone carriageway, lined with more than
200 marble columns with lotus designs, broke under the weight of
the floodwaters.
   The port end of the street disappeared and is now covered by a
small river. Near the heart of the ancient city, the waters reduced
the path to a jumble of stone blocks and columns fashioned from
Egyptian granite and Italian marble.
   Only the ancient market, theater and forum were spared the wrath
of the flood.
   Sandro Stucchi, an Italian archaeologist who surveyed the site,
estimated restoration would cost $33 million and take 10 years.
   Omar S. Almahgiub, superintendent of the archeological district
that includes Leptis Magna, said the Libyan government is hoping to
restore the site with help from the U.N. Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization.
   ``We want to make an appeal to all people who love monuments,''
said Almahgiub, looking at the weeds sprouting from several inches
of sun-baked dirt covering the base of the basilica's pulpit.
   Almahgiub, who was born in Leptis and whose father was a
caretaker of the site, said Libya would provide the personnel to do
the manual work but doesn't have the technical expertise.
   Bekaddour Ouldali of UNESCO in Paris said the organization has
asked Italy _which colonized Libya until World War II _ to provide
funds for a archaeological supervisor, preferably Stucchi, and has
provided earth-removal equipment and a pump in case a flood strikes
again.
   An Italian Foreign Ministry official, Manfredo Incisa, says his
government is willing to help but is waiting for a more detailed
report from UNESCO.
   Little is known outside Libya about the disaster because Libya's
magnificent archaeological inheritance is not easily seen.
   Tourism per se doesn't exist in the state ruled by Col. Moammar
Gadhafi. A recent summer Tuesday brought only about a dozen
visitors to Leptis Magna, almost all of them foreign diplomatic,
construction or oil employees.
   In addition, lovers of archaeology must step delicately in
Libya, whose regime frequently rails against foreign imperialism.
For the more militant Gadhafi supporters, reminders of ancient
colonialism like Leptis Magna are unwanted souvenirs to be
destroyed.
   Italians began excavating the sprawling city about 1912, the
same year the Rome-based government of dictator Benito Mussolini
occupied Libya, which Italy controlled until the arrival of the
Allied forces in 1943.
   The flood halted dreams for extensive excavation of the harbor,
considered one of the best preserved in the ancient Roman world and
expected to yield many relics from Leptis' beginnings as a key
Phoenician port and later a prosperous Roman city.
   Leptis was founded by seafaring Phoenicians from Carthage as a
trading post in the first millennium B.C. As merchants developed a
brisk business in ivory, ebony, slaves, gold and precious stones
from Africa, the site was established as a colony of Carthage about
the 7th or 6th century B.C.
   In 101 B.C., Leptis became an ally of Rome and its residents
gained full rights of citizenship.
   The city prospered during the reign of Emperor Septimius
Severus, who was born here in A.D. 193 and whose arch of triumph
greets visitors.
   With the decline of the Roman empire, Leptis eventually
succumbed to the raids of Germanic tribes that maintained a kingdom
in North Africa in the 5th century, then to Byzantine rule in the
4th century and finally to an Arab invasion in 642.
   Its name may derive from a Phoenician combination ``li'' and
``bada,'' meaning town at the edge of the desert. ``Magna'' _
meaning great in Latin _ has been added to distinguish the town
from another Leptis in Tunisia.
   Libya's rich collection of archaeological sites include
prehistoric cave paintings in the south, the ruins of a Greek site
called Sabratha west of Tripoli, and various relics from the series
of conquerors.

   Republican nominee George Bush has an
11-point lead over Democrat Michael Dukakis in Ohio but neither
candidate is favored by a majority of likely voters in the state,
according to a poll published Sunday by the Akron Beacon Journal.
   Bush was supported by 47 percent of those surveyed and Dukakis
by 36 percent, with the balance undecided, the poll said. The vice
president was ahead by a similar margin among all registered
voters, with a larger percentage undecided, the poll indicated.
   The survey, conducted by the Beacon Journal and the University
of Akron, was based on telephone interviews with 1,062 Ohio voters
between Oct. 3 and Oct. 13 and had a margin of error of 3.5 percent.
   The poll showed that 38 percent of the undecided voters were
Democrats and 46 percent were independents. Bush has made inroads
in both groups, the poll showed.
   The poll found Bush attracted 12 percent of the Democratic vote,
was running slightly ahead of Dukakis among middle-income voters,
was getting more than one-third of voters from union households and
was favored by 10 percent of black voters in Ohio.

<HEAD>`Mikki Maus,' 60 This Year, Makes His First Live Appearance in
Moscow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Here he's called ``Mikki Maus,'' and the
60-year-old American has surprisingly good rapport with Soviet
youngsters for an international film star making his first live
appearance in the Soviet Union.
   Sunday evening at Moscow's 2,500-seat Rossiya Theater, with a
police cordon worthy of a minor head of state outside, the first
Soviet festival of Walt Disney animated classics opened with a
showing of ``Fantasia'' and a visit by Mickey Mouse himself.
   Standing about 5 foot, 6 inches in his clunky black patent
leather shoes, Mickey, played by Gabriella Spieth from Walt
Disney's West German office, strolled waving down the theater aisle
to the strains of ``Heigh Ho, Heigh Ho, It's Off to Work We Go.''
   In a juvenile version of the Moscow superpower summit, Mickey
was given a big hug and a keg of honey by Misha the Bear, mascot of
the 1980 Moscow Olympics.
   The lights dimmed, and the Rossiya's screen filled with the
image of Donald Duck in the 1941 short subject ``Donald's Crime,''
in which he purloins the contents of a piggy bank to finance a
nightclub outing with Daisy, then suffers pangs of conscience.
   In a Russian-language voiceover, minus the squawking tones in
which Donald usually speaks in English, French and other Western
languages, the duck concluded: ``Crime does not pay.''
   There was delighted laughter and applause from the audience,
which included Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov and
many other Soviet VIPs and their families.
   As well as ``Fantasia,'' which was first released in 1940, the
Disney animated films ``Snow White and the Seven Drawfs,''
``Bambi'' and ``101 Dalmatians'' will be shown to children and
their parents in Moscow, Leningrad and Tallinn.
   Mickey is accompanied by a contingent of executives from The
Walt Disney Co. here to investigate the business possibilities
created by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic and social
reforms, which have also loosened controls on the media and the
movies.
   ```Fantasia' is almost 50 years overdue in coming to the Soviet
Union,'' Roy E. Disney, vice chairman of the Disney company and
nephew of its founder, pioneer animator Walt Disney, told the
audience.
   ``Through the universal language of animation ... I feel we are
taking one more step toward bringing our countries together,'' he
said.
   Disney and other company executives played down the business end
of their trip, but the Tass news agency said they were talking with
the Soviets about cooperation in making and distributing films and
in jointly building a ``Wonderland,'' a Disneyland-style theme park
already planned for Moscow.
   The Soviet Union is virgin territory for the Disney company and
its enormous stocks of cartoons, feature films and television
shows. Characters like Mickey, Donald, Chip and Dale and other
Disney creations that are childhood companions of hundreds of
millions in the West mean nothing to many Soviets.
   ``I don't know what Mickey Mouse is; I have never seen him,''
said Dmitri Bogdanov, 3{, who was brought to the Rossiya by his
mother, Varya, only because she had seen Disney cartoons on
videocassettes and at a Moscow movie theater that specializes in
cartoons.
   Although Mickey, Donald and their friends may not have instant
name recognition in the Soviet Union yet, their faces adorn
T-shirts, badges, children's clothing and hundreds of other items
made by cooperatives or sold on the black market.
   Mickey's creators do not get a single kopeck in royalties for
such exposure.
   According to Sovietskaya Rossiya, the first Disney cartoons were
shown in the Soviet Union at the first Moscow film festival in
1935. The cartoons, which included ``The Three Little Pigs'' won an
award.
   Sovietskaya Rossiya, a Communist Party organ that commonly
devotes its news columns to weighty matters like the national grain
harvest, said, ``Disney is a remarkable master and a genius second
to none.
   ``Who does not know, for example, his hero, a little mouse named
Mickey who really became the first `star' of the world screen, or
his inseparable friends _ the shy cow Clarabella with the langorous
eyes, a hot-tempered but handsome little duck, Donald; a
muddle-headed dog named Goofy, or a careful doggy named Pluto?''

<HEAD>Trial Starts For Two Accused In Government Corruption</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men charged in a government
corruption scheme were described by prosecutors as greedy crooks,
but defense lawyers say they are humanitarians who helped bring
20th century progress to Alaska's North Slope.
   Lewis Dischner, 70, and Carl Mathisen, 55, are charged with
bribery, extortion and other crimes stemming from their involvement
with the North Slope Borough, the Eskimo-led government for the
vast northern region of Alaska.
   They are accused of scheming to influence the awarding of
contracts during the borough's $1.2 billion public works
construction effort during the administration of borough Mayor
Eugene Brower from 1981 to 1984. The project included schools,
health clinics, airports, utilities and streets in the borough's
seven villages.
   Dischner worked as a lobbyist for the North Slope Borough, while
Mathisen worked as a public works consultant to Brower.
   ``This is a case about fraud, bribery, kickbacks, extortion and
corruption,'' said U.S. Attorney Michael Spaan as Dischner's and
Mathisen's trial opened Friday before a U.S. District Court jury.
   Testimony is expected to begin Monday.
   Dischner and Mathisen used their influence to defraud the
borough of $21 million, Spann said, and they were able to do it
through Brower, the young and inexperienced mayor they helped elect.
   ``This influence was based on friendship and trust and was
cemented by bribery,'' Spaan said.
   But Dischner's attorney, Douglas Pope, said the case was brought
``because the prosecution misunderstands the situation on the North
Slope.''
   The government is confused about the law, he said, and the
duties that Dischner had as lobbyist and adviser to Brower and his
public works program.
   ``This is a case about a man, Lew Dischner, with a strong sense
of values, a strong sense of what is right, being unfairly
prosecuted for his strong commitment to his dream.''
   That dream, said Pope, was that the Inupiat Eskimos of the North
Slope deserved the same basic standard of living and opportunity to
work enjoyed by the rest of Alaska and America.
   ``Life on the North Slope was as savage as those of us would
imagine it would be. The weather was cruel there,'' said Laurence
Finegold, Mathisen's attorney.
   Mathisen helped bring dramatic, if expensive changes, his
attorney said.
   ``I'm not saying the permafrost is flowing with milk and honey
as a result of the work of Carl Mathisen and Eugene Brower, but it
is more livable now.''
   Brower and other officials were also indicted as a result of a
federal investigation into the public works program. Brower, two of
his administrators and two engineeers have pleaded guilty to
various charges in a plea-bargain arrangement and will testify for
the prosecution.
   Dischner and Mathisen are accused of bribing Brower and other
borough officials with boats, cash, clothing and a $45,000 diamond
ring; demanding kickbacks totaling $9 million from six contractors
doing business in the borough; taking an additional $9 million
through companies they themselves controlled; and extorting
additional money from other contractors.

   Fourteen of the 23 members of the
ruling Politburo could be removed at a Communist Party meeting this
week, a Politburo member said Sunday.
   The party's policy-setting Central Committee gathers on Monday
for what is billed as a historic session that may include the most
sweeping personnel changes in the Communist Party since it came to
power after World War II.
   Four members of the Politburo have announced their intention to
resign at Monday's meeting.
   They include two former heads of the party, Bosko Krunic and
Milanko Renovica; Franc Setinc, a leading Communist from liberal
northern Slovenia and Kolj Siroka, a senior ethnic Albanian from
the troubled province of Kosovo.
   Politburo member Vasil Tupurkovski told reporters that 10 other
Politburo members also may be replaced.
   The other nine members are party chiefs from each of
Yugoslavia's six republics and two provinces and a representative
of the armed forces.
   They can be voted out of office only by the republican,
provincial and armed forces party organizations that elected them
to the ruling body.
   They include Serbian Communist party chief Slobodan Milosevic,
whose push for greater Serbian control of its two provinces of
Vojvodina and Kosovo has stirred up the current political crisis.
   Most political observers expect at least some Serbs from the
Slav minority in Kosovo to rally in Belgrade outside the modern
conference center where the Communist party starts meeting at 9
a.m. on Monday and is expected to last at least two days.
   The changes to be made are in response to widespread calls from
Serbia and workers angered by government austerity measures for the
resignation of top party leaders they see as inefficent and corrupt.
   The criticism has touched even national party chief Stipe Suvar,
who clashed last week with Milosevic and touched off a wave of
requests from Serbian party organizations for his resignation.
   In the past two years, 16 Politburo members and 44 members of
the Central Committee have come under fire in public, Tuporkovski
said.
   Of the 165 members that comprise the Central Committee, one has
died and two have resigned since the body was last elected by the
national Communist Party congress in 1986, leaving 162 members at
present.

entered in the Brazoria County Fair in early October. The animal
has a red splotch on its right side resembling the profile of
Abraham Lincoln.
   Garrett, a staunch Republican, said he gets numerous requests
daily from residents who want to see the likeness for themselves.
   ``They all see the resemblance right away,'' Garrett said. He
added that he's happy to show the calf to anyone and will allow any

likeness of Lincoln could boost any Republican's campaign.
   The calf's name? Abe Lincoln's Pride.

<HEAD>Five Blacks Killed In Township Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five black men were killed in
a series of attacks, including four in violence-plagued townships
outside Pietermaritzburg, police said Sunday.
   Two men were killed and 11 men and women suffered burn injuries
when attackers threw gas bombs at a home in the Mpumalanga township
near the southeastern city of Pietermaritzburg, police said.
   In the same township, police found the body of a man who had
been stabbed to death. Police also found a man who had been fatally
stabbed in the nearby township of Hammersdale.
   In Soweto, the main township outside Johannesburg, a man was
shot dead, police said.
   All the attacks were listed in the police report, which
describes incidents the previous 24 hours, but the report provided
no additional details.
   The townships outside Pietermaritzburg have been the site of the
worst black-on-black faction fighting in South Africa in recent
years. At least 600 people have been killed in black-on-black
fighting the last two years, according to most estimates.
   The main combatants are Inkatha, a political organization headed
by Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and the United Democratic

banned in February.
   Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the

whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools

   Vice President George Bush said Sunday he's ready
to ``hit the ground running'' as president and to designate a
Cabinet swiftly, but that he won't be lulled into regarding an
election victory as inevitable.
   ``There was speculation that I was dead three months ago,'' the
Republican presidential nominee told reporters, trying to discount
recent polls showing him with a widening lead over Democrat Michael
Dukakis.
   He vowed to wage a spirited battle against the Massachusetts
governor in key states right up to Election Day on Nov. 8.
   Bush scoffed at reports suggesting he had already decided on
most of his prospective Cabinet.
   ``I am not going to do something that dumb and shift gears,'' he
said.
   ``And yet, should I win, it would be a matter of urgent
priority. I'd want to be ready to move early on the priorities that
I've established.''
   He said ``there is not one scintilla of overconfidence'' that he
has all but won the election.
   At his first news conference in more than two weeks, Bush said
his election should drive interest rates down, claimed that the
Iran-Contra affair was behind him, and took aim at a familiar
target _ Harvard University.
   ``There's an elite inside the elite there. And everyone knows
who I'm talking about,'' Bush said.
   Campaigning Saturday in Modesto, Calif., Bush said, ``I don't
wnat somebody from Harvard telling me what I can do and what I
can't do.''
   Asked about that statement, Bush said he did not want to take on
the institution itself, asking ``How can I, a nice guy from Yale,
feel that way about Harvard? Now come on.''
   ``I'm talking about a handful of people that have served in
(recent) Democratic administrations that come out of the same
liberal philisophy. And they know who they are,'' he said.
   Dukakis is a Harvard graduate, and Bush in the past has accused
his rival of having a ``Harvard Yard boutique'' mentality.
   While spending the day in Denver visiting with his son, Neil,
and his family, Bush also attended a professional football game
between the Denver Broncos and the Atlanta Falcons. He planned to
spend most of this week campaigning in the Middle West on his
return to Washington from last Thursday's presidential debate in
Los Angeles.
   In his meeting with reporters, Bush once again declined to say
where he would make spending cuts to bring down the federal deficit
under his ``flexible freeze'' plan to balance the budget by 1992.
   Although he has spelled out areas where he would spend more
money, including education, child care and cleaning up the
environment, Bush has said he would list corresponding spending
cuts only if elected president.
   His proposal calls for overall federal spending to be limited to
the rate of inflation, with specific cuts offsetting each new
spending item.
   Bush conceded that, for his scheme to work, interest rates would
have to decline by several percentage points from current levels.
   ``A lot of the interest rates are psychological,'' he said. ``I
believe they will come down.''
   He suggested that a Bush presidency would send a calming message
to world financial markets, largely because they would see he had a
deficit-reduction plan that would work, and that in turn would ease
interest rates.
   Spokeswoman, Sheila Tate, was asked why markets would respond
more favorably to the Bush budget plan than they had to the Reagan
administration's past deficit-reduction plans.
   ``Because he (Bush) means it, he means what he says,'' Ms. Tate
said.
   Bush said that, though he did not want to be premature, he
already has named a team headed by former Navy Undersecretary Chase
Untermeyer to study the transition to a possible Bush presidency.
   ``He has drawn up wiring diagrams, what we should do if we
win,'' Bush said. ``You have to hit the ground running.''
   ``There are no names ... or lists against these slots on the
management wiring diagram. I just cannot get diverted into thinking
about that,'' Bush said.
   He added: ``We're going to keep on with our original game plan,
keep working hard, keep traveling to key states. We're going to
keep moving forward. ... All I know is to just drive right down to
the wire.''
   Bush also asserted that the Iran-Contra affair was ``behind me''
as an election issue, because most Americans believe his insistence
that he had no advance knowledge of the arms-for-hostages deals.
   The vice president said that, if elected, he would put running
mate Dan Quayle in charge of coordinating drug enforcement and
other important assignments to show world leaders that Bush has
``full confidence in the vice president.''

   Two boaters distracted by the colors of
the fall foliage shot over a 40-foot dam into the rushing overflow
below, where they were rescued by two fishermen, authorities said.
   ``They should have been killed, but were lucky,'' said Deputy
Bill Chandler of the Hennepin County Sheriff's Department. ``A lot
of that had to do with two fisherman on the shore below the dam who
went in with their boat and rescued them. They're heroes in my
book.''
   Don Oestreich, 57, of St. Louis Park walked away relatively
unscathed Saturday; Bernice Johnson, 58, of Minneapolis suffered
bumps and bruises and received four stitches on her forehead.
   ``Don was driving and I was riding backwards because of the
wind, and the colors were gorgeous,'' Johnson said. ``And when we
noticed the (warning) signs it was just too late.
   ``I think the first thing I thought was, `This is it.' My life
might have flashed before me, but I didn't have any time to think
about it _ there was too much noise and water.''
   Oestreich's 16-foot aluminum fishing boat remained upright in
the rushing waters of the Mississippi River near the Ford Lock and
Dam, and the couple was spotted and rescued by the fishermen.
   ``I'll tell you one thing, they're lucky they're alive and lucky
the boat landed the way it did, because that could have been the
end of it right there,'' said Steven Holets, one of the fishermen.
   ``It's so easy to capsize and drown there,'' said Deputy John
Nagan of the Ramsey County Sheriff's Department. ``A 40-foot drop
and the boat remained upright, it's just amazing.''
   Oestreich said: ``I was only on a quarter throttle, but I
managed to turn the boat to a right angle and sideways to the dam.
That was crucial because it saved me from nosing straight down.''

   At least 80 people were injured Sunday night when a
high-speed ferry carrying 248 people crashed into a breakwater in
Macao's harbor, police reported.
   The accident occurred several hundred yards off the Macao pier
just after the ferry jetfoil had departed for the neighboring
British colony of Hong Kong, authorities said. Macao, known as the
gambling center of Asia, is 40 miles west of Hong Kong.
   Police said 13 of the injured were hospitalized, most for minor
cuts and bruises, in this Portuguese enclave at the tip of south
China. Most of the passengers on board the Shun Tak Co. ferry were
residents of Hong Kong and Macao, authorities said.

   Soldiers erected roadblocks throughout the
occupied West Bank on Sunday to prevent dozens of Jewish settlers
from choking major roads to protest Palestinian violence.
   Hospital officials said an 18-year-old Arab died of wounds
sustained in a clash with troops last week, and an Arab reporter
said a 16-year-old youth was shot in the abdomen during a clash in
Gaza City.
   A spokesman for the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem identified
the dead youth as Usama Wasfi Shalabi of the West Bank village of
Atil.
   In an Arab village in northern Israel, police arrested a
Palestinian who shot and killed his landlord's two sons and
critically wounded their mother after the family refused to sell
him an apartment, police said.
   A relative of the family said the landlord did not want to do
business with Refat Odeh because he is a policeman in the occupied
territories, and a village elder accused Odeh of collaborating with
Israeli authorities.
   Hundreds of Arab policemen from the territories resigned last
March after they were accused by fellow Arabs of collaborating with
Israeli authorities.
   The incident Saturday night took place in Jaljoulya, an Israeli
Arab village bordering the West Bank.
   The army blocked settlers from protesting on two main West Bank
highways against increased Palestinian attacks on Jewish targets,
Israel radio reported. The action came a day after an Israeli man
was stabbed and wounded in the West Bank city of Jenin.
   Hundreds of soldiers mobilized at dawn and turned back dozens of
cars driven by the Jewish militants on roads linking the Nablus and
Hebron to Jerusalem, military sources said.
   Near the Ariel settlement outside Nablus, a group of settlers
fired their guns into the air and smashed the windows of several
Arab vehicles before troops arrived at the scene and turned them
away, Arab news reports said.
   The army had no reports of shootings and said the troops kept
roads open throughout the morning, permitting Palestinian laborers
to travel to Israel.
   About 65,000 settlers and 1.5 million Palestinians live in the
territories captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War.
   Since the revolt against Israeli occupation began Dec. 8, 299
Palestinians have been killed. Six Israelis have died in
unrest-related incidents during the same period.
   In political developments Sunday, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres
said he would be willing to give up the occupied Gaza Strip in
exchange for peace if his Labor Party wins the Nov. 1 parliamentary
elections.
   Speaking at a Foreign Press Association luncheon, Peres also
repeated his willingness to give up some territory in the occupied
West Bank and said he would immediately call for an international
Middle East peace conference if he is named prime minister.
   ``We do not want to dominate one-and-a-half million Palestinians
against their will,'' he said, referring to the population of the
West Bank and Gaza. ``We must let them run their own lives.''
   Asked specifically about Labor's Plans for the Gaza Strip, he
replied: ``We have in mind to evacuate the Gaza strip within an
overall arrangement. Gaza will be demilitarized.''
   Peres said he favored returning to the year-old U.S. proposal
for Israel to negotiate with a Jordanian-Palestinian delegation
through an international conference.
   He said he still believed he could bring Jordan's King Hussein
into negotiations despite the king's statement this summer that he
was breaking his ties with the West Bank, which Jordan held from
1948 until 1967.
   Peres' opponent Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the Likud bloc
opposes an international peace conference and wants a settlement in
line with the 1978 Camp David accords, which would offer limited
autonomy to the Palestinians with their future to be worked out
later.

   Democrats found inspiration Sunday in the Los
Angeles Dodgers' win in the first game of the World Series, saying
that Michael Dukakis can still pull off a come-from-behind victory
over Republican George Bush in the remaining three weeks of the
presidential campaign.
   ``I think we're going to be like the Dodgers last night,'' said
Dukakis running mate Lloyd Bentsen. ``It looked like they were down
and out, and all of a sudden they hit a home run and won it. I
think we can do that in the next 24 days.''
   Bush, alert to that possibility, said that despite polls that
show him widening his lead over Dukakis, ``we're going to keep on
with our original game plan, keep working hard, keep traveling to
key states... keep moving forward.''
   ``All I know is to just drive down to the wire,'' the vice
president said.
   Dukakis acknowledged in Boston that he is entering the last leg
of the long campaign as an underdog, but advised Republicans not to
pop champagne corks too early because ``we're going to be the ones
celebrating on election night.''
   He said he will continue fighting for the values he believes in.
He said Bush, as vice president, ``sat on the sidelines for eight
years while America got beaten in world markets, while they
mortgaged our children's future to a mountain of debt, and a piece
of America was being sold off every day at bargain basement
prices.''
   The World Series analogy was used by several Democrats.
   ``It's an extremely close race,'' said Sen. Albert Gore,
D-Tenn., on ABC`s ``This Week with David Brinkley.''
   ``You're going to see Mike Dukakis come on like Kirk Gibson in
the bottom of the ninth inning last night in that game with two
outs ... he could barely walk around the base path, but he knocked
a home run to win the game,'' Gore said.
   The Dodgers beat the Oakland Athletics, 5-4, in that first game
of the Series.
   Bush told reporters in Denver that he already has a team
studying the transition to a Bush presidency and that he is ready
to name his Cabinet quickly. Former Navy Undersecretary Chase
Untermeyer heads the Bush transition team.
   ``He has drawn up wiring diragrams, what we should do if we
win,'' Bush said. ``You have to hit the ground running.''
   The vice president, however, scoffed at suggestions that he
already had decided on most of the Cabinet members he would choose.
   Bentsen, appearing on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation,'' said the
Democratic ticket has been the target of character assassination by
Bush and his running mate, Dan Quayle.
   ``We were subjected to what I think was the most demagogic
attack that I've ever seen at the presidential level,'' Bentsen
said. ``To talk about, question the patriotism of Mike Dukakis is
outrageous ... but that's what they did, and that's wrong and we
must not let them win on that kind of basis.''
   The Dukakis camp was trying to put the best face on what many
perceived as a clear Bush victory in last Thursday's debate with
Dukakis.
   Dukakis adviser Robert Beckel said on the ABC program that
``there's a lot of time left in this race, there's a lot of
volatility in the electorate, and I find it amazing that all of
these people are writing this race off.''
   But Ed Rollins, a Republican strategist, said that ``over the
last three months, George Bush has made the sale; he has convinced
the American public that he has the strength and the ability to
lead this country.''
   Said Rollins: ``It's just a question now of getting the voters
to the polls on Election Day.''
   According to a published report, Dukakis plans to concentrate in
the three weeks left before the Nov. 8 election on 18 states with
272 electoral votes _ two more than needed for election _ to pound
home basic economic themes and to make Bush's campaign style an
issue itself.
   The Dukakis campaign vehemently denied the account by The
Washington Post in Sunday's editions.
   ``We are not writing off whole regions of the country,'' said
campaign manager Susan Estrich. ``We're very, very competitive in a
large numbers of states.''
   Communications director Leslie Dach said he thought the use of
18 states by the Post was misleading and said the newspaper's
grouping of states does not represent where the campaign will
concentrate its resources.
   Those 18 states, according to the Post, are New York,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois and California; the New
England states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and Rhode
Island; Maryland, West Virginia and the District of Columbia in the
mid-Atlantic region; Iowa and Wisconsin in the Midwest, and Oregon,
Washington and Hawaii in the West.
   In those states, the Post said, Dukakis managers believe the
Democratic nominee is either favored or competitive with Bush.
Their list gives priority attention to Montana, North and South
Dakota, Colorado, New Mexico, Missouri and Kentucky, where they
believe the Massachusetts governor is trailing but competitive.
   The Bush campaign, according to The New York Times, will
concentrate on California, Michigan, Ohio and Illinois, regarded as
close.
   Meanwhile, Dukakis picked up editorial support Sunday from the
St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times, which said Bush is running on a
platform which ``would perpetuate too much injustice, and the deeds
and examples of his campaign have been anything but inspirational.''
   The newspaper, which recommends candidates rather than endorsing
them, also criticized Bush's choice of Quayle as his running mate.
   ``Dukakis chose a man. Bush chose a boy,'' the newspaper said.
``Either Bush has delusions of immortality or he simply does not
care into whose incompetent hands his untimely death or disability
would deliver the nation. Neither explanation speaks well of his
own fitness for the presidency.''
   In Vermont, a random telephone survey for the Sunday Rutland
Herald and Barre-Montpelier Times Argus indicated a 43 percent to
42 percent lead for Bush over Dukakis. The random telephone survey
of 502 registered voters had a margin of error of 4.5 percent.

   Vietnam said Sunday that it will
complete its planned withdrawal of 50,000 military personnel from
Cambodia on schedule in December.
   That would leave about 50,000 Vietnamese troops in Cambodia.
   Vietnam has said it will remove all of its military forces from
the neighboring country by 1990.
   The beginning of the formal withdrawal was conducted at a
ceremony in June when Vietnam announced the withdrawal of its
military command and some 13,000 soldiers.
   It said other army units left Cambodia in July, August and
September.
   A joint communique issued Sunday by Vietnam and the
Vietnamese-installed Cambodian government said:
   ``The remaining units will be withdrawn monthly from now to the
end of 1988, and the last contingent of the 50,000 volunteers to be
withdrawn in 1988 will be repatriated by land and water during the
month of December.''
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978, ousted the radical
communist Khmer Rouge regime and installed another communist
government. Communist forces defeated U.S.-backed governments in
Vietnam and Cambodia in the spring of 1975.
   The joint communique, carried by the official Vietnam News
Agency, welcomed representatives of foreign countries,
international agencies and news organizations to observe the final
stage of the first half of the withdrawal plan.
   The United Nations is expected to pass again this year, for the
10th consecutive year, a resoludion demanding the pullout of all
Vientmaese troops from Cambodia. But a new element in the draft of
this year's resolution calls for ``effective international
supervision and control'' of the withdrawal.
   More than 1 million Cambodians were killed during the harsh rule
of the Khmer Rouge, and there is widespread fear that the Khmer
Rouge will regain power if Vietnam pulls all of its forces out of
the country.
   The Khmer Rouge began a guerrilla campaign after it was ousted
in 1978 and has the strongest military force in a coalition of
groups fighting the Vietnamese and Cambodian grovernment troops.

<TEXT>
   An earthquake struck western Greece
Sunday afternoon and government officials said at least 25 people
were injured as buildings collapsed and landslides ripped down the
mountain slopes.
   The Environment Ministry advised people not to return to
hundreds of damaged buildings.
   State television said about 30 tremors of lesser magnitude
rumbled through the same region throughout the afternoon.
   ``As far as we know a total of 25 people were slightly injured
by the quake,'' government spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos said.
``The state apparatus is on full alert and all the necessary
material, such as tents and drugs, have been sent to the area.''
   The quake measured 6 on the Richter scale, according to the
Athens Seismological Institute.
   It said the initial quake occurred at 2:34 p.m. and the center
was 150 miles west of Athens in the Ionian sea between Killini and
the resort island of Zakinthos.
   ``People panicked tremendously and rushed out into the streets
as soon as it happened, '' said Aleka Markoyiannaki, a local
government official.
   ``In some villages almost half of the buildings collapsed,'' she
said. ``It was really very disastrous and the damage is very
extensive.''
   Almost 80 percent of the villages of Bartholomou and Kastro were
destroyed, police in Killini reported.
   ``Streets are filled with rubble and plaster and there's lots of
broken glass from shattered shop windows everywhere,'' said a
police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Police on Zakinthos said the quake caused landslides in the
island's hills. Western Greece has been hit by several quakes
during the past month, and two days ago one registering 5 on the
Richter scale rattled the same region.
   A devastating earthquake struck the Ionian islands in 1953,
killing 400 people and destroying thousands of homes. After that
most buildings on the islands were contructed to resist tremors of
up to 7 on the Richter scale.
   The scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake as
measured by the ground motion recorded on seismographs. Each
increase by one number means a tenfold increase in ground motion. A
quake registering 6 can cause severe demage while one recorded at 7
is consdered a major quake capable of widespread heavy damage.

   Entertainer Johnny Carson returned to his
boyhood home Sunday to dedicate a regional cancer center in honor
of his parents.
   About 750 people attended the ceremony outside the Carson
Regional Radiation Center at Lutheran Community Hospital. Carson's
$650,000 gift last year pushed the hospital's fund drive over its
$1.3 million goal, hospital officials said.
   Carson said he felt an obligation to respond to the fund drive,
especially in the face of hard economic times that have hit
Nebraska communities.
   ``If you're lucky enough in this life to accumulate enough funds
to live better than you have any right to, then you have a moral
obligation to pay back to the community or to the country or to the
place that brought you up,'' Carson said.
   ``I'm honored to be from the Midwest,'' he said.
   The Carson family lived in Norfolk from 1933 to 1947.
   The comedian said his parents would be very proud to have the
center named for them. Utility executive H.L. ``Kit'' Carson died
in 1964, and his wife, Ruth, died in 1985.
   ``My dad would probably say, `Ooooh boy, John,' and my mother
would say `Do you think that really looks like me?''' Carson said,
referring to a bronze likeness of his parents unveiled.
   The 3,000-square-foot center houses a radiation therapy linear
accelerator for the treatment of cancer. Hospital officials say the
center will be able to treat about 300 patients yearly.

   A gas leak Sunday forced the evacuation of 200

   Firefighters and gas company crews closed the Boston building
for almost two hours early Sunday afternoon while they tried to
determine the source of the leak. There were no injuries during the
evacuation, authorities said.
   ``They're still looking for the leak itself,'' said Boston Gas
Co. spokeswoman Mary Fitzpatrick. ``We don't suspect anything
unusual.''
   ``The gas leak was not in the building,'' she said. ``It's out
in the street and had gotten into the basement.''

<HEAD>Rain Moves Across Nation's Midsection, Pacific Northwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rainshowers and thunderstorms stretched across the nation's
midsection ahead of a cold front Sunday, and rain also fell
throughout the Pacific Northwest and parts of Florida.
   The cold front extended into the middle Mississippi Valley, and
rain extended from Arkansas, through Indiana to western Michigan.
   Rain showers were scattered from the northern Rockies west
through the Pacific Northwest as a cold front settled across the
region. The front was associated with a developing low pressure
system that was moving southeast across central Montana.
   Winds gusted to 62 mph with blowing dust around Cody, Wyo., and
high winds were also reported in the northern Rockies, Montana and
parts of the Nebraska panhandle.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms were scattered over east-central
and parts of southern Florida.
   Rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT included
nearly an inch at the Naval Air Station near Memphis, Tenn., over a
half inch at K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base near Marquette, Mich.;
Indianapolis; and Dillon, Mont.
   Temperatures were in the 60s or 70s across much of the nation
Sunday afternoon. Temperatures were in the 50s from the northern
Rockies through the northern Plains and upper Great Lakes into the
lower Ohio Valley where rain was falling. Readings were in the 40s
over western North Dakota.
   Temperatures warmed into the 80s from parts of the central High
Plains through Texas to the western Gulf Coast. Temperatures were
also in the 80s across the southern half of the Florida peninsula.
Temperatures were in the 80s and 90s across the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EDT ranged from 46
degrees at Lake Yellowstone, Wyo., to 100 degrees at Palm Springs,
Calif. The nation's low Sunday was 15 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   The forecast for Monday called for a low pressure system to
sweep from the northern Plains into the upper Great Lakes and
spread rain showers from the upper Mississippi Valley through the
Great Lakes region. A trailing cold front was expected to scatter
showers and thunderstorms from the lower Ohio Valley through the
middle Mississippi Valley into eastern Kansas and northern
Oklahoma. Scattered rain showers were expected north of a
stationary front that was to extend across northern Oregon.
   Temperatures in the 60s or 70s were predicted for much of the
nation. Highs were to be in the 50s from northern Washington state
through the northern Rockies and northern Plains into upper
Michigan. Highs were to be in the 80s across much of the southern
tier of the nation, from the central and southern Pacific Coast
through the southern Rockies, the southern Plains and the Gulf
Coast into Florida. Highs were expected in the 90s over the
northern California valleys and desert Southwest.

<TEXT>
   An expected purge of the Communist
Party leadership will at best be only a start in trying to ease
Yugoslavia's worst crisis since World War II.
   The party Central Committee meets Monday to argue and approve
what are billed as the most sweeping personnel changes in more than
four decades in power.
   A Politburo member said Sunday that 14 of the 23 members of the
ruling Politburo may be removed at the meeting of the policy-making
Central Committee.
   Four have announced their intention to resign and Politburo
member Vasil Tupurkovski told reporters 10 others may be replaced.
   However radical the changes are at Monday's meeting, they will
be only a stage in what one best-selling writer and dissident
called the ``long agony'' of breaking with founding father Josip
Tito.
   Tito dominated Yugoslavia for 35 years, ruling supreme until he
died in May 1980. His portrait still hangs in almost every public
room in the country and is carried fondly by some of the Serbian
nationalists who have staged mass rallies throughout southern and
eastern Yugoslavia in recent months.
   Their devotion to Tito is in some ways ironic, since they hope
to restructure the ineffective political system Tito bequeathed his
nation. Their demand for greater Serbian control over the Serbian
republic's two autonomous provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo
prompted the current political crisis.
   Serbian Communist Party leader Slobodan Milosevic has skillfully
exploited the mass rallies. He has achieved national prominence on
the wave of indignation Serbs feel about the alleged harassment of
their fellow Christian Slavs in Kosovo, the ancient Serbian kingdom
that is now dominated by ethnic Albanians, who are mainly Moslem.
   In exploiting the rallies, Milosevic has broken the order laid
down by Tito, who gave broad autonomy to Yugoslavia's six republics
and two provinces and annually rotated national offices among them
to prevent one region from dominating the others.
   Milosevic's drive has alarmed non-Serbian Communist leaders who
fear the nation's largest ethnic group wants greater control over
Yugoslav affairs.
   Yet they cannot ignore his popularity in Serbia and the broader
appeal of his calls for changes in the aging and sometimes
ineffective ruling elite.
   On television and in newspaper columns last week, leaders
engaged in an unprecedented public dispute over which leaders from
which region will stand or fall when the Central Committee replaces
up to one-third of its 165 members at Monday's meeting.
   ``In these circumstances, it is easier to teach a whale to play
the tambourine than to carry out the personnel changes,'' commented
the Belgrade daily Borba.
   The ethnic arguments are only part of Yugoslavia's problem.
Unwise borrowing in the 1970s and the lack of a strong federal
government to manage the economy have led to economic crisis, with
the foreign debt at $21 billion and annual inflation at 217 percent.
   Living standards have fallen by one-half since 1980, and
austerity measures adopted in May have slashed salaries while
prices continue to rise.
   Striking workers have taken to the streets in increasing
numbers, prompting the alarmed government to seek permission from
the International Monetary Fund to relax the austerity program.
   The ethnic and economic arguments sometimes obscure the growing
calls to abandon one-party rule and state-run economic management.
   The corruption in each Yugoslav republic angers the impoverished
workers, and the verbose and tangled Communist jargon that
surrounds most political pronouncements annoys even Communists
themselves.
   After watching members of the national party Politburo and the
Kosovo leadership debate for seven hours in Kosovo's capital,
Pristina, on Tuesday, the party leadership of the Serbian town of
Titovo Uzice commented, ``if the debate at Monday's meeting is
dominated by the tenor of the one in Pristina ... then it had
better be canceled.''
   This frustration indicates the pressure for change in
Yugoslavia. But writer Dobrica Cosic, a wartime hero and former
Communist purged by Tito in 1968, predicts that rearranging its
political system will be a ``long agony.'' ``For decades, we have
lived in a false situation,'' Cosic said in an interview. ``False
standards, a false economy, a false unity, a false freedom. ... At
some moment, the potentials of that fiction are exhausted, and that
moment is approaching.''

<HEAD>Soviets Publish Picture Of AIDS Victim, Asks Finns To Do Same</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Leningrad newspaper printed the photo of a local
prostitute that it said was the first Soviet citizen to die of
AIDS, the official Tass news agency reported Sunday.
   The news agency reported Soviet authorities also wanted the
picture to be printed in Finland newspapers because it claimed the
woman's last customers were Finns. There was no immediate response
from Finish authorities.
   Tass identified the victim as Olga Gayevskaya, 29, and said she
died Sept. 5 in the Leningrad Institute of Refresher Training for
Physicians. It said the cause of death was confirmed as AIDS _
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   The woman's picture was printed Saturday by the Leningradskaya
Pravda newspaper with a warning to any Leningraders who had had sex
with her that she was carrying AIDS.
   It urged those people to report immediately to the city's AIDS
testing center, which the report said is open 24 hours a day to
administer anonymous tests.
   Tass said the photograph was published ``on the demands of
(Leningradskaya Pravda) readers and following heated debate among
medics, lawyers and the police that it should be reprinted by
newspapers in neighboring Finland.''
   ``It is Finnish tourists who have been of late the most frequent
clients of the prostitute,'' Tass said.
   The agency said Ms. Gayevskaya sought medical help, complaining
of persistent colds and a weight loss of 26{ pounds, and she was
hospitalized in August with pneumonia.
   Soviet authorities once maintained AIDS was an exclusively
Western problem, linked to the moral decline of capitalist
countries. But in the last two years, health officials have said
the disease is a serious threat although they say the number of
cases is far lower than in the West.
   Tass said Aza Rakhmanova, Leningrad's chief specialist on
infectious diseases, reported tests on tens of thousands of people
showed 24 Leningrad residents, including nine Soviet citizens, were
carrying the AIDS virus.
   ``What is particularly deplorable is that one of them is a
6-year-old girl who contracted the disease from her mother,'' the
agency said.
   AIDS is an incurable disease in which a virus attacks the body's
immune system, leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of
infections and cancers.
   It is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Other means
of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or blood
products and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles or
syringes by drug abusers. AIDS can also be passed from mother to
child at or before birth.

   Former Queen Farida, the divorced wife of
Egypt's last king, Farouk, died Sunday of leukemia and other
complications. She was 67.
   The former queen married King Farouk in 1938 when she was 17 and
he was 18. They were divorced 11 years later.
   Farouk was toppled in a bloodless military coup in July 1952 and
exiled to Rome.
   Farida lived mostly in Paris in her later years and held a
number of exhibits in Cairo.
   In a coma for most of the past two weeks, she had suffered from
leukemia, kidney inflammation and pneumonia. President Hosni
Mubarak ordered the state to pay her medical bills.
   She is survived by three daughters from her marriage with
Farouk. Other details were not immediately available.

<HEAD>Bloodless Bullfighting Draws Oles and Nays</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES J. GANS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With a tap of his hand, Mexican matador Manuel
Espinosa symbolically killed an 842-pound bull, drawing a chorus of
``ole'' at a bloodless bullfight Sunday.
   His sword had a Velcro tip and the bull's horns had been clipped
to eliminate any possibility of bloodshed from man or beast. But
the bullfight still prompted efforts by city officials and animal
rights activists to halt what they claim is an inhumane activity.
   Outside the International Amphitheatre, about 30 members of
Trans-species Unlimited, an animal rights group, marched with
picket signs to protest the bullfight, the second in six weeks, as
a mariachi band hired by the organizers entertained arriving
spectators.
   Kay Sievers, director of the group's Chicago chapter, said
``bloodless bullfighting'' is banned in 43 states, and should be
prohibited in Illinois. Bloodless bullfights are staged in parts of
California, Texas and annually in Dodge City, Kan.
   ``It's just another form of animal abuse and exploitation ...
and we are trying to prevent it,'' she said. ``We have nothing
against Latino culture. This is not a racial or a cultural issue,
but an ethical issue.''
   Homero Alvarado, the head of Meda, a Hispanic self-help
organization that co-sponsored the exhibition, defended
bullfighting as an important part of Hispanic culture dating back
to the Middle Ages.
   ``Why don't they stop the rodeo, or the circus, or the pigs
fighting with a man at the State Fair in Springfield,'' which are
crueler to animals, said Alvarado.
   Alvarado said the organizers spent about $150,000 to stage the
event, including legal fees and the cost of bringing in six
professional matadors from Mexico and six California-bred bulls.
   Any profits will be used to buy food and Christmas toys for poor
Mexican families in Chicago, he said. The bulls were to be
slaughtered to provide meat for Meda's food bank program.
   Alvarado said his group would like to sponsor six to eight mock
bullfights a year in Chicago, and similar shows in Texas, New York
and other states with large Hispanic populations.
   But Peter F. Poholik, executive director of the city's
Commission on Animal Control and Care, said he was determined to
make this the last bullfight in Chicago.
   ``In Korea they eat dogs, in Puerto Rico they fight cocks ... do
we want to do this in Chicago?'' asked Poholik. ``There's a long
list of animal exploitation among different cultures ... and we
don't want to expand it.''
   Poholik said he was pleased only about 200 people turned up at
the 9,000-seat amphitheatre for the first of two bullfight shows
Sunday.
   The city's first bloodless bullfights were held on Sept. 3 at an
outdoor arena over Poholik's objections and drew about 1,100 people.
   Cook County Circuit Court Judge Albert Green granted permission
to stage the fights, ruling that the confrontations were no more
cruel than rodeos, which the city allows, and that the city's
animal cruelty law is vague.
   Poholik said city attorneys were drawing up a proposed city
ordinance banning the bullfights.

<HEAD>Three Escaped Prisoners Holding Family Hostage Die In Shootout</HEAD>
<NOTE>With Laserphoto SEL-1</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three escaped prisoners holding a
family hostage died and a fourth was captured Sunday in a dramatic
shootout. One prisoner remained at large climaxing a week-long
manhunt involving tens of thousands of police.
   The five prisoners were among 12 who opened handcuffs with a
makeshift key during their transfer in a prison bus Oct. 8 and fled
with a loaded pistol. Seven prisoners have been recaptured or
surrendered.
   Saturday night, four fugitives armed with the pistol and knives
raided the home of Ko Yong-soo, a 50-year-old office worker, in
northwestern Seoul and held Ko's wife, four daughters and a son
hostage.
   Ko returned home early Sunday, but said he escaped and called
police after the drunken guards fell asleep. More than 500 armed
policemen immediately sealed off the house and anti-terror units
huddled under the walls.
   During their confrontation with police, the prisoners fired
several shots, threatening the lives of hostages. They ignored
appeals from their relatives to surrender, but released Ko's wife
and 11-year-old son.
   Shortly after noon Sunday, there were several minutes of screams
and gunfire, and police rushed into the house. One prisoner was
dragged out and another, bleeding from his neck and body, was taken
out on a stretcher.
   Police said the other two prisoners were found dead, without
elaborating, but news reports said they killed themselves.
   Police said the injured prisoner, Chi Kang-hun, died about three
hours after he was taken to the hospital. Police said Chi cut his
neck with broken windows, when officers broke in and opened fire.
   Police said all hostages were rescused unhurt.
   The prisoners had raided at least six homes, held families
hostage for food, sleeping and bathing, and dissappeared with
extorted money and valuables.
   Their continued flight and sporadic appearance across Seoul had
frightened many Seoul residents, although they did not hurt anyone
held. The escapees, each sentenced to seven years or more for
murder, rape or robbery, often told hostages they had escaped
because their sentences were too harsh.
   On Friday, four escapees invaded a western home to evade an
extensive manhunt when one colleague was caught. Police launched a
house-to-house search, but the four managed to flee shortly before
police arrived.

<HEAD>Jewish Congress Head Visits East Germany On Reparations Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the World Jewish Congress on
Sunday began a three-day visit to East Berlin, where he is to
discuss an East German offer to pay reparations to Jewish victims
of the Nazi Holocaust.
   Edgar M. Bronfman arrived in a private jet and was greeted by
Deputy Foreign Minister Kurt Nier at East Berlin's Schoenefeld
Airport.
   Later at his hotel room, he told The Associated Press he
believed the East German leadership was sincere in offering
reparations but he could not provide details.
   ``Judging from the reception at the airport and the schedule
that has been put forth I'm optimistic,'' he said.
   ``Of course there has to be some earnest money. But I have said
the money is a token thing. What is at stake here is moral
culpability.''
   ``I am the first World Jewish Congress president to visit East
Germany,'' he added. ``I think this is good for East-West
relations.''
   East Germany's communist authorities said in June the government
was willing to provide ``humanitarian aid'' to Jewish survivors of
the Holocaust but they gave few details and there have been
negotiations on the amount and methods of payment.
   Jewish leaders in West Berlin have said East Germany is
considering paying up to $100 million.
   West Germany signed an agreement in 1952 with the New York-based
World Jewish Congress to compensate Holocaust victims and their
relatives and since then has provided about $48 billion.
   Bronfman is to meet Monday with East German leader Erich
Honecker.
   An agreement for East Germany to pay reparations would mark a
major change by the government.
   East Germany has argued it bears no reponsibility for Nazi
atrocities because the nation was not founded until 1949 when the
victorious World War II Allies acknowledged the division of Germany
into East and West.
   It also has taken the stand that both communists and Jews were
victims of the Nazis.
   Bronfman's arrival was the top item in East Germany's state-run
news media. The official ADN news agency also carried a lengthy
article about the opening of an exhibit devoted to the history of
Jews in Germany and their persecution by the Nazis.

<TEXT>
   Voters in half a dozen states face an eclectic mix of tax
measures Nov. 8, from a steep hike in cigarette taxes to tax cuts
reminiscent of California's decade-old Proposition 13.
   But there are signs the anti-tax fever that gripped the nation
after Californians enacted Proposition 13 in June 1978 has cooled
as inflation has eased, the economy has improved and taxpayers no
longer feel so squeezed.
   Only in South Dakota, Utah and Colorado will voters decide
issues this November that would force deep cuts in taxes.
   ``Voters are protecting what exists, but not going further. And
in some cases, it looks like the electorate is willing to approve,
more so than in the '70s or early '80s, very specific taxes for
specific purposes,'' said Patrick McGuigan, editor of the Free
Congress Initiative and Referendum Report, a monthly newsletter
published in Washington.
   Californians, for example, will consider a measure to raise
cigarette taxes by 25 cents a pack, using proceeds to promote
health.
   The tax revolt peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s when
voters passed tax-limiting measures in Massachusetts, Missouri and
Washington and 21 state legislatures enacted taxing or spending
limits, according to the National Conference on State Legislatures
in Denver.
   Some key tax issues facing voters this November:
   _South Dakota: Dakota Proposition II would roll back property
taxes on agricultural property to 1 percent of 1984 values, and 2.5
percent on non-agricultural property in stages by 1991. It would
limit increases in property valuations to 2 percent a year. Local
governments could impose special taxes if two-thirds of the voters
approve.
   Supporters argue the state overrelies on property taxes and
never lived up to promises to reform taxes after a similar ballot
proposal was rejected in 1980.
   Opponents, including Gov. George Mickelson, cite a University of
South Dakota study that warns that local governments stand to lose
from $18 million to $112 million a year, and that schools would be
hardest hit.
   _Colorado: Having survived legal challenges, Amendment 6, the
so-called Taxpayers Bill of Rights Amendment, will appear on Nov. 8
ballots. It would require voters to decide all future tax increases
except in emergencies, would cut the income tax by about 10 percent
and would limit residential property taxes to 1 percent of market
value.
   Gov. Roy Romer said the measure would be ``like throwing a
bomb'' at state government. He and other political and business
leaders who oppose the issue say it would cut state revenues by $65
million in the first year and $130 million the second.
   _Utah: Voters face three tax initiatives that together would
reduce state and local revenues by $329 million. One would limit
property taxes, a second would roll back 1987 tax hikes on income,
sales, gasoline and cigarettes, and a third would give tax credits
for private education.
   A poll this month forecast an uphill battle for the initiatives,
which are opposed by Republican Gov. Norm Bangerter, his Democratic
challenger Ted Wilson, and a wide range of agriculture, education
and wildlife groups.
   _California: A tobacco industry-led coalition has spent $10
million to defeat Proposition 99, which would boost cigarette taxes
for the first time since 1967, from 10 cents to 35 cents a pack.
Opponents call it an unfair tax that would trigger a wave of
cigarette smuggling.
   The measure, which could raise $600 million a year, would
finance anti-smoking programs in schools, medical care for the
uninsured and tobacco-related medical research.
   It is backed by a variety of medical and health care groups as
well as the American Cancer Society and the American Lung
Association.
   _Arkansas: The ``Fair Tax Amendment'' backed by Gov. Bill
Clinton would make it easier for the Legislature to enact personal
income tax increases. Income tax increases currently require a 75
percent majority vote in the Legislature; the amendment would lower
that to 60 percent. The state has had an income tax since 1929 but
it has been raised only once in history, in 1971.
   Anti-tax activists have filed a lawsuit challenging the
amendment, and representatives of some business groups oppose the
idea of making income tax increases easier.
   But Clinton said that if the amendment passes, the state ``will
still be one of the hardest states in the country to raise a tax
in.''
   _Nevada: Question 9 on the ballot seeks to impose a
constitutional ban on personal income taxes, even though the state
does not have one. The gaming industry is backing the measure on
the theory that if new taxes ever became necessary, the measure
would force the Legislature to look for other ways to spread the
tax burden through corporate income taxes as well as existing
property, sales and gaming-related taxes.
   They argue existing state taxes place too big a burden on the
gambling industry while other forms of industry have relatively
light tax loads.

<TEXT>
   Cuban authorities have broken up a black
market ring that operated out of a major Havana food store, a
government news report said Sunday.
   Police officers arrested ``numerous hoarders and resellers of
basic necessities,'' Prensa Latina, the official Cuban news agency,
said in a report monitored in Mexico City.
   Employees of Mercado Amistad, Havana's largest grocery, were
believed to have been involved in a scheme that allowed the illegal
resale of large quantities of basic goods at inflated prices,
Prensa Latina said.
   Also, some of those arrested allegedly ``sold places in (the
grocery store) line to the highest bidder and in this way earned
more than a worker,'' the report said.
   ``The scarcity of various products caused by distribution,
organization, inefficiency and bureaucratic problems, plus the lack
of foreign exchange, encourages the proliferation of speculators,''
Prensa Latina said.
   The market, where consumers often wait in long lines for scarce
goods, is in the old Sears, Roebuck and Co. building that was
nationalized after the 1959 Cuban Revolution.
   Private enterprise has been all but eliminated on the communist
island. Two years ago, the government ended experimental farmers'
markets that had allowed growers to sell surpluses.

militia has tightened his grip on power in Lebanon's beleaguered
Christian enclave with the aid of Iraq and reportedly Israel as
well.
   But Samir Geagea faces trouble with Syria, which blames him for
a political crisis that threatens to formally partition Lebanon and
scuttle Syria's hopes of controlling its unruly neighbor.
   Syria is also alarmed at political and military support for the
Christians from Iraq, its archrival in the Arab world, after the
Aug. 20 cease-fire in the Iraq-Iran war.
   Geagea, a 38-year-old Maronite Catholic, sabotaged parliamentary
efforts to elect a successor to President Amin Gemayel before his
six-year term expired Sept. 23.
   He opposed Damascus-backed Christian candidates who he said
would turn Lebanon into a ``Syrian satellite'' if elected. Under an
unwritten law since Lebanon became independent from the French in
1943, Lebanon's president has been a Christian.
   Geagea's heavily armed Lebanese Forces militia, with about 6,000
hard-core fighters and 30,000 reservists, this month took over
Gemayel's 3,500-man militia and his news outlets and confined him
to his east Beirut home.
   Geagea, a former medical student, was left as the undisputed
leader of the Christian enclave, home to about 800,000 Christians.
Moslems make up about 55 percent of Lebanon's population.
   Beirut newspapers have reported the Israelis, who occupy a
border strip in south Lebanon, sent Geagea a shipload of weapons
through Beirut's militia-controlled port last month.
   There has been no independent confirmation, but the Israelis
have aided Geagea in the past.
   Uri Lubrani, who coordinates Israeli policy on Lebanon, has said
on Israel Radio that Israel was not involved in Lebanon outside the
border buffer zone, but stressed it has ``an immediate and
fundamental interest in what happens (in Lebanon). ... Israel is a
partner in the game.''
   Iraq enraged Syria by recognizing the Christian government of
army commander Gen. Michel Aoun, who Gemayel named as caretaker
prime minister, rather than the rival Moslem cabinet of acting
Prime Minister Salim Hoss. Both cabinets now claim they are
Lebanon's legitimate government until a new president is elected.
   Informed Arab sources said Iraq has shipped the Christians
ammunition, rocket launchers and U.S.-made armored personnel
carriers captured from Iran. Some have been seen in Christian east
Beirut.
   Geagea, who has gained supremacy in bloody showdowns with his
rivals over the last three years, has survived a dozen
assassination attempts as Syria sought to impose its will on the
Christians.
   Lebanese Moslem and leftist officials who visited Syrian
President Hafez Assad in Damascus said he raged when Geagea usurped
Gemayel.
   Tishrin, the Syrian government daily, accused the ``Geagea
group'' of ``preventing Lebanon from achieving a constitutional
presidential election ... and seeking the partition of Lebanon.''
   It warned that Syria ``will not allow any partition situation to
be imposed.''
   But after a 13-year civil war, Lebanon is a state in name only.
   The Syrians, the main power broker in Lebanon, want to impose a
settlement through the election of a Christian ally who would
reduce the Christians' traditional privileges and give the majority
Moslems an equal share of political power.
   But Geagea and other right-wing Christians, who have seen their
people driven out of the Chouf mountains and the coastal plain
south of Beirut into the shrunken 390-square-mile enclave, reject
any surrender of political power.
   Geagea favors a federal arrangement with the Moslems, who with
the Syrians control about 70 percent of Lebanon.
   He has forged an alliance of expediency with Aoun, another
Maronite. But how long that will last is questionable. The two men
long have distrusted each other, and their forces have skirmished
repeatedly over the last three years.
   Aoun, 53, believes that some understanding must be reached with
the Syrians, if only to get them out of Lebanon.
   Syria has an estimated 40,000 troops in Lebanon, mostly in
Moslem areas.
   Like the Israelis and the Americans, Syria has learned that
intervening militarily in Lebanon can be costly. In 1976, it tried
to quell the civil war and wound up battling the Christians.
   But with Geagea's power swelling, and outside powers using the
Christians to thwart Syrian ambitions, Syria's room to maneuver is
diminishing.

<HEAD>Protestant Extremists Claim Responsibility for Killing Two</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Protestant extremist group
said Sunday its gunmen killed a leader of the Protestant Ulster
Defense Association because he betrayed the association's cause in
Northern Ireland.
   The outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters said its members killed
James Craig and George Raney at east Belfast's Castle Inn pub on
Saturday.
   Four other people were wounded as the killers sprayed the
crowded room with gunfire.
   In a statement to the news media, the Ulster Freedom Fighters
said Craig, 47, was the target and claimed the other victims were
shot when Raney tried to attack one of the gunmen.
   Initially it was suspected that guerrillas of the outlawed Irish
Republican Army carried out the attack.
   The predominantly Roman Catholic IRA has been been fighting for
years to unite Northern Ireland, a British province where
Protestants outnumber Catholics 3-2, with the mainly Catholic
Republic of Ireland.
   Protestant extremists formed organizations to battle the IRA.
   The Ulster Defense Association is not illegal but the Ulster
Freedom Fighters is. The Ulster Defense Association was formed in
1971 as an umbrella organization for Protestant vigilante groups
and British news reports have said the Ulster Freedom Fighters is
the association's military branch.
   Some east Belfast residents suggested that Craig's killing
involved racketeering.
   Press Association, the British domestic news agency, said the
ruling council of the Ulster Defense Association last year ordered
an investigation into Craig's activities. It said he had been
accused of skimming money from the estimated $5.2 million raised
annually through rackets operated by Protestant extremists.
   In 1985 Craig and two other men appeared in the Belfast
Magistrates' Court to face 33 charges related to extortion from
contractors.
   Witnesses who testified wore hoods to avoid reprisals. The case
was dropped before going to trial.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II, marking the 10th
anniversary of his papacy, beatified three 19th century priests
Sunday and called for ``authentic sovereignty'' for Poland during a
meeting with pilgrims.
   About 50,000 well-wishers carrying candles jammed St. Peter's
Square Sunday evening to take part in a prayer vigil and celebrate
the anniversary. The pope leaned out the window of his private
studio and blessed them.
   ``Ten years ago the church of Rome received through divine
providence the bishop that now thanks you, the man who came from
afar,'' the pope said in Italian. ``He saluted you the first time
with these words: Praised be Jesus Christ. I do that again this
evening, and I salute, with you, the entire world.''
   In the afternoon, he told 5,000 cheering Polish Catholic
officials and pilgrims at a Vatican auditorium that ``the
independence of Poland can not be measured by geopolitical
criteria, but only with the criteria of authentic sovereignty for
the nation.''
   His remarks, in Polish, were reported by the Italian news agency
ANSA.
   The three who were made blesseds of the Roman Catholic Church
included the Rev. Venceslao Kozminiski, a Polish priest who founded
20 religious orders and associations; and two priests, the Rev.
Bernardo Maria Silvestrelli and the Rev. Carlo Houben.
   Kozminski, born Oct. 16, 1829, in Biala Podlaska, Poland,
founded an order of nuns in 1855, three years after he became a
priest. He founded a monastic order three years later and before he
died had began 20 different religious congregations or orders.
   Silvestrelli, born in Rome in 1831, headed the Scala Santa (Holy
Staircase) passion congregations for 25 years and under his
direction the monastic order grew from six to 12 congregations.
   Houben, born in Munstergeleen, the Netherlands in 1821, was sent
to England and Ireland, where he spent much of his time as a
missionary to coal miners.
   Beatification in the Roman Catholic Church is a step toward
possible sainthood.
   The ceremony Sunday took on added interest because it came on
the anniversary of the day 10 years ago when John Paul became the
surprise choice of the conclave to succeed Pope John Paul I, who
died after just 33 days on the throne of St. Peter's.

   A car bomb exploded Sunday night as an
armored car of the paramilitary civil guard passed by, killing one
guard and injuring seven, police reported.
   They blamed Basque separatists for the attack and two other
bombings that killed one person and injured three.
   Police said the car bomb contained up to 66 pounds of explosives
and as many pounds of shrapnel. It exploded near the provincial
jail in this northern city. The blast destroyed or damaged 15
parked cars and shattered windows in six apartment buildings.
   The slain guard was identified as Julio Gangoso Otero, 31, the
driver of the armored car.
   Earlier Sunday a bomb exploded outside a tunnel near the
railroad station of Lepazpia in northern Spain, killing Juan Jose
Pacheco Cano, 26, a member of the autonomous Basque police, and
injuring three other people, according to police.
   They said a second bomb exploded inside the tunnel but caused no
casulties.
   No group claimed responsibility but police suspected guerrillas
of the Basque separatist group ETA, a Basque language acronym for
Homeland and Liberty.
   The deaths brought to 13 the number of victims blamed on ETA
this year.
   ETA has asserted responsibility for more than 600 killings, with
most of the victims police and military officers, since it took up
arms in 1986 to gain independence for the three-province Basque
region in northern Spain.

   A fourth person has been charged with
murder in the beating death of an 8-year-old girl at a house run by
a religious center founded to train and discipline inner-city
youngsters, authorities said Sunday.
   The 59 children found since Friday in the rural house where the
girl was allegedly beaten to death were in state custody, said Bart
Wilson, Clackamas County branch manager of the state Children
Services Division.
   Brian James Brinson, 30, of Los Angeles was charged Saturday
with murder. He was initially taken into custody Friday on a charge
of hindering prosecution, according to Clackamas County sheriff's
spokeswoman Judy Gage.
   Three other staff members of the Ecclesia Athletic Association
also face murder charges in the death of Dayna Lorea Broussard. Her
father, Eldridge Broussard Jr., is founder of the association and
leader of the Watts Christian Center in Los Angeles.
   Officials said several adults from the center brought the dead
child to a fire station in a rural area 25 miles east of Portland
early Friday. Dayna was beaten on her head, chest and extremities
and died of ``multiple blunt-force injuries,'' said state Medical
Examiner Larry V. Lewman.
   Investigators found 53 children crowded into the four-bedroom
farmhouse on Friday, some with scars that might indicate physical
abuse, said sheriff's Capt. Pat Detloff. All are reportedly from
Los Angeles.
   Wilson said at a news conference Sunday that six other children
ranging in age from 1{ months to 12 years were removed from the
home Sunday. Wilson said the children placed in care of the state
``seem to be in good health.''
   ``Based on everything we know right now, we'll recommend
continued custody'' at a preliminary hearing Monday afternoon in
Oregon City, he said.
   ``We've had little contact with the parents,'' Wilson said.
``We've not heard from very many of them.''
   Broussard was interviewed Sunday by sheriff's investigators. He
declined to appear at the news conference.
   In an interview with KATU-TV of Portland, Broussard accused the
news media of slanting stories about Ecclesia.
   ``Now, murder's involved,'' Broussard said. ``And I accuse you
on national television of murder in the first degree.''
   ``Now my little girl is dead,'' he said. ``And that our whole
group has been pressured into all manner of activities we would not
have had to do had we been understood a little better.''
   Carolyn Van Brunt, a spokeswoman for Broussard, said Friday
night from Los Angeles that the group sometimes uses ``physical
correction'' as a form of discipline, but denied the punishment was
cruel.
   Last year, Ecclesia officials claimed to have established a camp
at the same site to train children for the Olympics. But it was not
clear if the children found here last week were engaged in a
similar training program.
   The children, ranging from 3 months to 16 years of age, were
hungry but otherwise healthy, according to officials who admitted
them to state juvenile facilities over the weekend.
   They spent Saturday talking with pediatricians, playing with
donated teddy bears and enjoying peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches, authorities said.
   ``The kids are starting to open up and have become fairly
animated,'' he said Bill Carey, acting director of client services
for the state Children's Services Division. ``They were quite
hungry when they arrived. It seems that they only had a tomato
apiece on Friday.''
   The other three persons charged with murder are Constance
Zipporah Jackson, 37, and Frederick Paul Doolittle, 28, both of Los
Angeles, and Willie K. Chambers, 35, of San Diego. All four
suspects were in custody Sunday at the county jail.
   Two other adults connected with Broussard's group were charged
with hindering prosecution and jailed in lieu of $100,000 bail each.
   Broussard, 35, was a star basketball player at Pacific
University in Forest Grove, Ore., in the 1970s. He founded the
controversial athletic association in 1975.
   The organization brought an estimated 70 to 100 men, women and
children from Los Angeles to the Sandy area in April 1987. They
returned to Los Angeles in June 1987 after neighbors opposed
Ecclesia's applications for zoning permits to allow 55 children and
45 adults to live in tents and use portable toilets and showers.

   Five nuns remained locked inside
the infirmary of their monastery Sunday to protest changes in their
way of life, and no progress was reported toward a solution to the
dispute.
   ``The television and radio reporters are all outside waiting
around but basically everything's at a standstill today,'' said
Betty Sutton, a lay worker at the Roman Catholic Monastery of the
Most Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel. She has acted as a
liaison between the nuns and the media.
   ``Nobody is speaking today,'' she said Sunday. ``We think it
will be quiet until tomorrow.''
   The changes made at the monastery include the introduction of
sweets, radio and television. The five barricaded nuns think the 13
nuns at the monastery should strictly adhere to the traditional
Carmelite life, which stresses prayer and silence.
   The nuns locked themselves in the monastery's infirmary on Oct.
4. They say they acted out of fear that the Diocese of Paterson
would evict them.
   They have said they will not give up their vigil until their
case is considered by the Vatican in Rome, which under canon law is
the official arbitrator in intra-order disputes.
   On Saturday, the Rev. Kevin Culligan, a Carmelite friar from
Wisconsin, met with the sisters but was rebuffed when he could not
prove through documents that he was the designated representative
of the Vatican the nuns say they want. His official position gives
him authority over Carmelite friars but no direct power over nuns
of the order.
   Bishop Frank Rodimer, head of the diocese, has said the nuns
could be relieved of their vows for their actions.

   Hundreds of rioting students burned
furniture and clashed with police in a second night of homecoming
weekend violence that resulted in 50 arrests by officers clad in
riot gear, police said Sunday.
   At least six people, including a police officer and a person
found in a trash carrier, were treated at a hospital for minor
injuries suffered Saturday night and early Sunday, said hospital
nursing supervisor Patricia Anderson.
   As many as 1,500 people, including many St. Cloud State
University students, were involved in the rioting in a four-block
area on Friday and Saturday nights, Assistant Police Chief Jim
Moline said.
   Students set off firecrackers and some played the Beatles' song
``Revolution'' on a stereo as police swept through the crowd,
estimated at about 700 people Saturday night. Other people tore
down street signs and jumped on cars, or threw beer bottles and
pieces of lumber.
   About 60 officers, including some from the State Patrol and
neighboring counties, shot tear gas to disperse the crowd and made
46 arrests, most on misdemeanor charges of unlawful conduct or
criminal damage to property, Moline said.
   After a lull of a few hours, 150 officers were sent in early
Sunday to break up crowds of 150 to 200 people, some of whom had
set fire to furniture and a trash carrier that had been dragged
into the street, Moline said.
   ``It's like a battle between the police and the students,'' said
Karen Jacobs, the managing editor of the student newspaper, the
University Chronicle, who watched the disturbance from her
dormitory room.
   The riots broke out in the midst of homecoming celebrations by
the school's 16,400 students. Witnesses said the problems began
when officers tried to break up loud parties and fights.
   ``The catalyst for this whole thing was a lot of young people
with a lot of booze in them,'' Moline said. ``They're not
experienced enough with alcohol and they just go kind of crazy.''
   Moline said that in his 31 years on the police force, the
weekend's violence could be topped only by demonstrations against
the Vietnam War in the 1960s.
   Student Randy Ridenour, 23, of Minneapolis said officers backed
off several times Saturday night to avoid a potentially disastrous
confrontation.
   ``It was mob mentality,'' he said.
   Many people had been drinking heavily and were enjoying the
havoc, he said. ``A lot of kids thought they were being cool and
funny. The students were acting stupid.''
   Some of the handful of people arrested Friday night probably
will be charged with felony assault for throwing beer bottles, and
the arrests Sunday morning will result in several more misdemeanor
charges, Moline said. Thirty-four of the 50 people arrested were
university students.
   University President Brendan McDonald said he would appoint a
task force to investigate the violence and met with school
officials to discuss the situation further.

   Hundreds of soccer fans tried to force their
way into the packed Cairo Stadium Sunday to watch a match between
two Cairo teams and police used tear gas to disperse the crowd,
   Officials said one person was killed and 50 people were injured
in the melee.
   The stadium has a 100,000-spectator capacity but it was
overcrowded for the game between the Al-Ahli and Tersana teams,
which was not televised.
   Police said most of the fans who attempted to crash through the
gates were supporters of the Al-Ahli team, which is leading the
12-team national soccer league. Tersana is 5th in the standings.
   The game was played and Al-Ahli won 3-1.
   Cairo television recently stopped broadcasting live reports of
most games after the owners of several soccer teams said the
programs were reducing their ticket sales.
   The state-owned newspaper Al-Ahram, in its report on Sunday's
violence, called on the government to order the televison network
to resume live broadcasts of the games.

   About 100 demonstrators gathered outside a jail
Sunday to protest what they said was the refusal of the city to let
a jailed Roman Catholic priest celebrate Mass.
   The Rev. Norman Weslin of Colorado Springs, Colo., was one of
more than 300 people arrested Oct. 4 at three Atlanta abortion
clinics on the first day of a week of anti-abortion protests.
   Sunday's demonstration was in the form of an ecumenical church
service led by Catholic priests and Protestant ministers.
   The ministers, some of whom were jailed during the
demonstrations or a similar series of sit-ins and protests last
summer, said the alleged refusal was a serious breach of freedom of
religion.
   Weslin is one of the about nine protesters who remain in jail,
mostly because of refusal to sign a bail bond or to give their true
identities.
   Weslin said in a statement read to the group that he has been in
solitary confinement since he tried to celebrate Mass for prisoners
Oct. 11. He denied a city claim that he was forcing the Mass on
people and blocking passageways.
   He also rejected a city argument that he is free to leave jail
at any time.
   ``I cannot, in good conscience, pay a bail bond for attempting
to save a child's life. If I am released on my own recognizance, I
will leave here,'' said Weslin, who said he is on a fast of coffee
and water.
   More than 1,200 people have been arrested since the protests
began July 19 at Atlanta abortion clinics. The protests have been
organized by the New York-based Operation Rescue.
   In San Antonio, Texas, police arrested 45 people who blocked
entrances to an abortion clinic Saturday.
   ``We don't want to telegraph our punches, but we want people to
know this isn't a fleeting fad,'' said Jack Devault, head of Life
Support Services and one of the coordinators of Saturday's
demonstration.
   All those arrested outside the clinic were charged with criminal
trespass, a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and
a fine up to $1,000.

   Youth gangs are ``America's terrorists''
and the greatest challenge facing the nation's police chiefs, said
the head of the International Association of Chiefs of Police.
   ``(Gangs have) taken over entire sections of major cities and
are spreading to the streets in smaller cities,'' said Joe Casey,

   Casey is president of the assocation, which officially opened it
annual convention in Portland on Sunday.
   Between 5,000 and 7,000 top law enforcement officials from the
United States and 43 countries are expected to attend the
convention, which runs through Thursday.
   Speakers include U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, FBI
Director William Sessions and John C. Lawn, head of the federal
Drug Enforcement Administration.
   Participants at a convention workshop on Saturday said law
enforcement officials need to cooperate with community leaders and
educators in the fight against gangs.
   ``It's the short-term efforts, like (gang) sweeps, that get a
lot of attention,'' said Bernard C. Parks, deputy police chief in
Los Angeles. ``But it's the active role of communities that can
help.
   ``There (have) to be a good number of changes in the schools and
in adult education,'' he said. ``The responsibility has to be
spread to all areas.''
   Parks said Los Angeles police had on file names of some 26,000
gang members, more than double the number in the 1970s.
   Nevertheless, Parks said, his city is unwilling to shoulder the
blame for the spread of gang violence.
   ``Many communities that experience the gang problem find it all
too convenient to blame it on Los Angeles,'' said Parks. ``There is
a lot of mimicking by kids in different places. It doesn't
necessarily mean they come from Los Angeles.''

   Unseasonably heavy rain in the Cascade mountains
flooded rivers throughout western Washington state, chasing about
45 people from homes and a campground on Sunday.
   Rain was tapering off late Sunday, but more was predicted Monday
night and early Tuesday with the approach of another storm system,
the National Weather Service said.
   Red Cross volunteers fed and arranged shelter for 30 people
evacuated from trailers in the Snoqualmie River Campground in the
Cascade foothills, said spokeswoman Hope Tuttle.
   Some of the campground occupants lost everything they had with
them, KOMO-TV reported.
   About 15 people apparently were staying with relatives after
being evacuated by boat Sunday morning from houses in Sultan, a
town of about 1,500 residents in forest land 30 miles northeast of
Seattle, said Judy Campbell, a dispatch supervisor for the
Snohomish County sheriff's office.
   Floodwaters from the Skykomish River closed five roads in the
area, she said.
   The Snoqualmie, Skagit and Stillaguamish rivers also reached
flood stage at upper elevations Sunday, the weather service
reported. A flood warning for the Nooksack River was canceled late
Sunday.
   Heavy rain washed enough logging debris down the Skagit River to
cause a partial dam to form at a Burlington Northern railroad
bridge, but no major problems were anticipated, said Tom Sheahan,
management director of the Skagit County Department of Emergency
Services.
   Several logging roads were temporarily washed out and Hanson
Creek flooded, but damage was minimal and no evacuations were
required, he added.
   Several roads were closed in the Cascade foothills east of
Seattle because of flooding around Snoqualmie Falls, said Rochelle
Ogershok of the King County Department of Public Works. Some
sandbagging was done in the North Bend area, nearly 30 miles east
of Seattle, but no evacuations were required there, she said.
   Floods usually follow warm rains on a late fall or winter
snowpack, but heavy rain over the weekend in the Cascades was
enough by itself to send rivers over their banks, she said.
   During the 48 hours up to 5 p.m. Sunday, the weather service
reported 1.64 inches of rain in Bellingham, 1.39 in Olympia and
1.04 at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. More than 6 inches of
rain fell at Stampede Pass, just south of Snoqualmie Pass and about
50 miles south-southeast of Seattle.

   Voters in half a dozen states face an eclectic mix of tax
measures Nov. 8, from a steep hike in cigarette taxes to tax cuts
reminiscent of California's decade-old Proposition 13.
   But there are signs the anti-tax fever that gripped the nation
after Californians enacted Proposition 13 in June 1978 has cooled
as inflation has eased, the economy has improved and taxpayers no
longer feel so squeezed.
   Only in South Dakota, Utah and Colorado will voters decide
issues this November that would force deep cuts in taxes.
   ``Voters are protecting what exists, but not going further. And
in some cases, it looks like the electorate is willing to approve,
more so than in the '70s or early '80s, very specific taxes for
specific purposes,'' said Patrick McGuigan, editor of the Free
Congress Initiative and Referendum Report, a monthly newsletter
published in Washington.

   The United States has agreed to pay the
Philippines $481 million annually and back a bond program to help
ease the country's foreign debt as part of a lease agreement for
U.S. military bases, Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus said Sunday.
   Secretary of State George Shultz and Manglapus planned to sign
the pact on Monday. In Manila, Philippine President Corazon Aquino
announced the expected signing, but provided no details.
   A U.S.-Philippines working group picked away at the details of
the agreement on Saturday and again on Sunday. While some technical
points remained to be resolved, the signing ceremony tentatively
was set for Monday afternoon.
   ``We still continue to be hopeful to conclude the
negotiations,'' said Alex Almasov, a State Department press officer.

   Sabotage or another criminal act
caused a plane crash that killed President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, the
U.S. ambassador and 28 others, said a report released Sunday by a
U.S.-Pakistan investigation team.
   The 365-page report ruled out mechanical failure in the Aug. 17
crash of the Hercules C-130 transport plane, said Pakistan air
force Cmdr. Abbas Mirza, who gave a 27-page summary to reporters at
a hastily called news conference.
   ``The board believes that the accident was most probably caused
through the perpetration of a criminal act or sabotage,'' said the
summary by the 10-member U.S.-Pakistan team.
   The summary did not blame any person or group for the crash but
called for a separate criminal investigation.

   Planes brought food supplies to starving
refugees Sunday, but a relief official said it would take at least
two weeks to reduce deaths and help emaciated people so weak they
can't protect the corpses of loved ones from scavenging hyenas.
   Another relief official said the $1 million, 10-day airlift to
the war-ravaged south, which began Thursday, came too late to save
thousands of younger children.
   Twin-engine Cessnas are carrying 90 tons of food to about 40,000
southerners facing starvation in Abyei, 500 miles southwest of
Khartoum. They are hoping to provide stopgap relief for those who
left behind their crops and cattle to escape a civil war in the
region.
   A Western relief official said it would take two to three weeks
before the impact of the U.S.-financed supply mission could be
felt. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said eight
to 10 people, weakened by malnutrition, lack of medical treatment
and a long trek to refugee camps, were dying every day.

   A year after Wall Street's crash, Americans
widely view the stock market as a risky investment, and fully a
third see a good chance it will plummet again soon, a Media
General-Associated Press poll has found.
   Although respondents doubted the market's stability, 75 percent
said the crash of Oct. 19, 1987, had little or no effect on their
lives, and only about one in 10 said their finances had worsened in
the past year.
   But the crash did have one apparent impact: Of the 1,125 adults
in the national telephone survey, more than six in 10 said they
were being more cautious with their money now than they were a year
ago.
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 508 points in panic
selling on Black Monday, after dropping 108 points the previous
Friday. Stock losses amounted to $500 billion, but the crash did
not set off an economic recession, as had been feared.

   The 100th Congress, running behind schedule,
is trying to finish work this week on election-year bills dealing
with drugs and taxes so members can return home to campaign.
   Some legislators were so itchy to leave town that on Friday they
sported buttons reading, ``Free the 100th.''
   ``I certainly would hope we wouldn't have to stay beyond
Wednesday. But nobody can predict that,'' said Senate Majority
Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.
   Congress originally aimed to quit Sept. 30, but bogged down in a
fight over the anti-drug package. The Senate finally passed its

   Congress, disturbed by evidence the Energy
Department has mismanaged nuclear weapons reactors, has passed a
law to put them under standards nearly as stringent as those
applied to reactors used to produce electricity.
   Some lawmakers, however, believe even tougher legislation is
needed in the wake of the Energy Department's acknowledgement that
its aging reactors at the Savannah River Plant near Aiken, S.C.,
have experienced problems and that other plants have spewed
radioactivity into the environment.
   ``The main difficulty is that the Department of Energy has been
its own policeman,'' said Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., one of the
authors of a bill passed in September creating the Defense Nuclear
Facilities Board to monitor the operation of weapons reactors.
   The board, yet to be appointed by the president, has the
authority to inspect the facilities at which the Energy Department
manufactures nuclear weapons for the Pentagon.

   State Department officials engaged in quiet
discussions last week about a man who, although unseen by the
outside world for nine years, is at the heart of a diplomatic
debate over one of the world's most unfortunate countries.
   He is Pol Pot, whose three-and-a-half-year rule in Cambodia
during the late 1970's led to the slaughter of perhaps 2 million of
his countrymen before he and his Khmer Rouge allies were driven out
by Vietnamese invaders.
   David Hawk, an authority on the Khmer Rouge, says Pol Pot is
believed to be operating out of a small town in Thailand near the
Cambodian border, plotting a return to power once the Vietnamese
carry out their stated intention to withdraw from Cambodia in 1990.
   Hawk has written on Cambodia for Freedom House, a New York-based
human rights group, and formerly worked for Amnesty International.

   A racial slur uttered in frustration nearly
ended Lois Bostic's 27-year career in education. Then her black
students stepped in, taught their elders a lesson in tolerance, and
saved Mrs. Bostic's job.
   ``We were ready to forgive and go on,'' said senior Angela
Matthews, 17, one of six students who initiated, typed and
distributed petitions in support of the white librarian. ``Anybody
ought to get a second chance.''
   After the slur was reported last month, parents in this farming
town 80 miles southeast of Little Rock circulated petitions calling
for Mrs. Bostic's ouster, and she told school officials she would
quit. The board promptly endorsed her decision.
   But then, high school students mounted their own petition drive,
the school board rescinded its resolution, and Mrs. Bostic is here
to stay.

   Here he's called ``Mikki Maus,'' and the
60-year-old American has surprisingly good rapport with Soviet
youngsters for an international film star making his first live
appearance in the Soviet Union.
   Sunday evening at Moscow's 2,500-seat Rossiya Theater, with a
police cordon worthy of a minor head of state outside, the first
Soviet festival of Walt Disney animated classics opened with a
showing of ``Fantasia'' and a visit by Mickey Mouse himself.
   Standing about 5 foot, 6 inches in his clunky black patent
leather shoes, Mickey, played by Gabriella Spieth from Walt
Disney's West German office, strolled waving down the theater aisle
to the strains of ``Heigh Ho, Heigh Ho, It's Off to Work We Go.''
   In a juvenile version of the Moscow superpower summit, Mickey
was given a big hug and a keg of honey by Misha the Bear, mascot of
the 1980 Moscow Olympics.

<HEAD>Negotiations Continue Past Deadline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRIDGETON, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators for Caterpillar Inc. and the
United Auto Workers union remained locked in labor talks past a
Sunday strike deadline as 17,500 blue-collar workers in five states
awaited word from the bargaining table.
   No strike was called as both sides tried to find common ground
and avoid a walkout.
   ``There has been a little bit of movement, and that small
movement is enough to warrant continuing the talks,'' said Karl
Mantyla, UAW spokesman at the site of the talks in a Bridgeton,
Mo., hotel near St. Louis.
   ``We're going to remain flexible to see if that leads us in the
direction we want to go. Negotiations are continuing. We can't
predict how long it's going to go,'' he added.
   Mantyla described the talks as an ``hour-by-hour situation'' and
said the labor contract was not extended past the 9:30 a.m. Sunday
deadline.
   Caterpillar spokesman Mark Polzin said he had nothing to add to
Mantyla's statement.
   The contract between Peoria-based Caterpillar and the UAW
originally was scheduled to expire at midnight Sept. 30. But the
two sides agreed to extend talks indefinitely pending the outcome
of talks between the union and Deere & Co.
   Deere and the UAW settled without a work stoppage when the two
sides agreed to a three-year contract that included a 3 percent pay
increase, boosts in retirement benefits and greater job security.
   It was the first general pay raise for Deere workers since 1981,
and the union hoped to use the Deere contract as a pattern for its
Caterpillar talks.
   Caterpillar workers were poised to strike factories and
warehouses at 12 cities in Illinois, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Colorado
and Tennessee.
   Negotiations started Aug. 4 between the union and Caterpillar,
the world's largest manufacturer of earth-moving equipment with
58,800 employees in several countries.
   Union representatives had asked the company for merit pay, 100
percent job security, a reduction in overtime and the recall of
1,000 laid off UAW members. They also sought an early retirement
program and an increase in pension benefits for those on early
retirement.
   The union reportedly was seeking a three-year pact and a 3
percent wage increase in each year of the contract.
   In past talks Caterpillar officials have sought more flexibility
in job assignments and scheduling, as well as a simplified
grievance procedure and new guidelines for overtime.
   The average factory worker at Caterpillar earns $14.61 an hour,
or $30,388 annually for a 40-hour week. With fringe benefits,
Caterpillar calculates its current labor costs at $26 an hour per
employee.
   In 1986, negotiations between the two sides were extended four
times before a settlement was reached.

<HEAD>Manville Reports 3rd Qtr. Earnings</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Manville Corp., on the verge of emerging from six years of
bankruptcy court protection, on Sunday reported its net income
increased 9 percent in the third quarter as sales of the company's
fiber glass and forest products rose.
   For the quarter ended Sept. 30, Denver-based Manville said net
income totaled $53.5 million, or $1.96 a share, up from $48.6
million, or $1.76 a share a year ago.
   Net sales during the period rose 7 percent to $584.3 million,
from $547.9 million in the 1987 third quarter.
   Manville President and Chief Executive Tom Stephens noted the
positive performance ``was achieved despite the continued
competitiveness in most construction related markets.''
   Sales of the company's fiber glass and forest products rose 7
percent in the quarter.
   Manville filed for Chapter 11 protection in 1982 while being
deluged with asbestos injury and property-damage lawsuits. By 1986,
property damage claims alone had come to a staggering $85 billion,
or about 40 times the company's total assets. The company also
faced more than 17,000 personal injury claims in the billions of
dollars.
   Earlier this month the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the last
challenge to Manville's reorganization plan, virtually assuring the
company's emergence from protection from its creditors under
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The plan calls for establishing
certain trusts to settle claims of asbestos health victims.
   ``With our strong operating performance and solid balance sheet,
we're ready to exit Chapter 11 and move forward,'' Stephens said.
   For the first nine months, net earnings were $122.3 million, or
$4.31 a share, down 8 percent from $132.6 million, or $4.73 a share.
   The current period includes certain charges and costs associated
with the restructuring. Excluding the effects of the restructuring,
Manville said net earnings would have totaled $136.2 million for
the first nine months, compared with $120.1 million in the year-ago
period.
   Net sales during the first nine months totaled $1.65 billion, up
7 percent from $1.54 billion in the year-ago period.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Refrigerators, irons, washing machines and a host
of other electric appliances have vanished from Moscow stores
partly because production has stagnated amid rising demand, a
Soviet newspaper reported Sunday.
   The article in Trud, the labor daily, was the latest in a series
of recent exposes on what the Soviets call ``deficits'' _ the
disappearance of goods from stores. Muscovites are now coping with
deficits on hard-to-find products ranging from razor blades to
detergent.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has said improving the array of
goods and services available to Soviet consumers is necessary to
show that his economic reform plan has taken root, but problems
with both quality and quantity are still rife.
   The Trud report said that in some cases, Soviets are now buying
10 irons at a time when they appear on the market out of fear of
future shortages.
   T. Korobkov, the head of a research institute on consumer
demand, told the paper that rumors of a pending price rise linked
to Gorbachev's reforms had triggered a buying boom.
   ``People have rushed to buy vacuum cleaners and refrigerators in
reserve before they rise in price,''' Korobkov said. He also said
economic cooperatives were buying up to 20 percent of some
products, apparently also contributing to shortages.
   Production of many electric appliances has also stagnated, Trud
said. The number of refrigerators produced is in a ``frozen
state,'' the paper noted. Last year about the same number were
built as in 1980.
   Trud said that of the 315,000 refrigerators needed to satisfy
the anticipated demand in Moscow this year, orders had only been
filled for 186,300.
   The capital received 258,000 vacuum cleaners, instead of the
540,000 needed, and only 804,000 irons, instead of the more than 1
million required, Trud said.

   Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham
Nazer called for ``solidarity to bring us all good'' as he opened a
meeting Sunday with five other members of the Gulf Cooperation
Council.
   The minister's statement, carried by the official Saudi press
agency, said that low oil prices brought on by overproduction
require joint action ``to bring prosperity to our nation and
countries.''
   The report did not outline what plan Nazer might present during
the meeting, called to forge a joint strategy to help OPEC prop up
deteriorating oil prices.
   Four of the six GCC members _ Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and
the United Arab Emirates _ are ranking members of the 13-nation
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. While GCC members
Oman and Bahrain are not part of OPEC, their economies depend on
oil export revenues.
   The meeting at GCC headquarters here began early Sunday evening.
The ministers did not speak to reporters before the single session
began.
   A worldwide oil glut has sent crude prices tumbling as much as
$8 below the $18-a-barrel OPEC benchmark. Much of the excess crude
comes from Gulf producers, including Iraq and Iran.
   OPEC members collectively are pumping more than 3 million
barrels in excess of the aggregate ceiling the cartel agreed to in
late 1986 to try to defend the $18 price.
   Many producers have openly ignored their quotas. The United Arab
Emirates, for example, renounced its 948,000-barrel-a-day quota and
is pumping about 1.5 million barrels daily.
   Saudi Arabia announced it will no longer cut production and
sacrifice its revenue to defend prices. It has exceeded its quota
of 4.3 million barrels per day in recent weeks to pressure other
overproducers into respecting the quota system.
   Industry executives and Western diplomats believe that the GCC
ministers have to discuss their own quotas and consider means of
coercing Iraq and Iran into cooperating.
   The two countries are emerging from an 8-year war; both have
said they will pump as much oil as they deem necessary to finance
billions of dollars in reconstruction.
   Iraq has suggested it will cooperate with OPEC. Iran's
parliamentary speaker, Hashemi Rafsanjani, said Friday that there
was ``no reason to quarrel with the countries on the southern coast
of the Gulf'' over the oil market.
   ``If we quarrel, the situation will remain as it is now. Why
should oil sell at $10 or $11?''
   The Saudi newspaper Arab News noted that Iraq and Iran want
``really high revenue, be it by pumping or through high prices by
cooperating and cutting prooduction.''
   The paper said producers are considering raising the OPEC
ceiling by raising members' quotas, but such an arrangement has to
wait for the upcoming meeting of OPEC's strategy committee.
   If all these efforts fail to stem the overproduction problem,
``we are poised for another price crash,'' a senior oil source told
the paper.

   Eighty-four demonstrators, including at
least two children under 10, were arrested Sunday in a protest
against the long-delayed Seabrook nuclear power plant.
   Those arrested had climbed a fence with handmade ladders or had
blocked plant gates during the finale of a two-day protest against
possible low-power testing of the $5.6 billion plant later this
year. Attendance Saturday was more than 300, and the Sunday figure
was about 200.
   Marie Benedum, 88, of Sanborton, who had four generations of her
family at Sunday's protest, wanted to go over the fence, but held
back because of a bad knee.
   ``If I didn't (have the knee problem), I would have gone over
the fence,'' she said.
   ``This is a very decisive time,'' she said. ``There is so much
at stake. They want to start the low-power testing, and I don't
believe in that.''
   Police said nine juveniles among those arrested were not
charged. They said the other 75 were charged with criminal
trespassing, a violation comparable to a speeding ticket, and
released.
   The first arrests Sunday occurred when about 39 protesters used
homemade ladders to scale the 10-foot fence and sat inside plant
grounds. Some walked with police officers to a waiting school bus,
while others went limp and had to be dragged away.
   During the fence scaling, more than 100 other demonstrators,
including women with infants in strollers, stood outside the fence
chanting and beating drums to support those who went over.
   The protesters also clamped several huge padlocks and chains
onto a plant gate, and police brought out a heavy duty bolt cutter
to get them off.
   Seabrook has been a target of protests since before construction
began in 1976. It was completed in 1986, but has been unable to get
a federal operating license. Federal regulators have yet to approve
evacuation plans for surrounding communities, including some in
Massachusetts, and sort out the financial problems of owners,
including main owner Public Service Company of New Hampshire, which
filed for bankruptcy protection in January.
   The protesters marched peacefully from nearby Hampton Beach on
Saturday, then held an all-night candlelight vigil outside the
gate. In terms of arrests, the protest was the largest since May
1987 when 130 people were arrested at the gates. The biggest was in
1977 when 1,414 people were arrested.
   Seabrook is close to winning a low-power license following
recent Nuclear Regulatory Commission decisions. Plant officials
hope to start the reactor for low-power tests for the first time
later this year.
   Three people were charged with trespassing Saturday when they
joined a tour of the plant being conducted by the pro-nuclear
Coalition for Reliable Energy. The three sat in at the plant's
reception center and refused to leave at closing.
   Plant officials had a low-key reaction to the protest.
   ``We agree with the rights of this small group of demonstrators
to their protest; we disagree with their position that Seabrook is
not safe,'' spokesman Ron Sher said. ``The fact is, Seabrook has
consistently received high marks from federal evaluators.''

<HEAD>Lower Fuel Costs Offset Sharply Higher Food Costs in September</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A large drop in energy costs in September outweighed sharply
higher food prices and kept the overall rise in wholesale prices at
a moderate 0.4 percent, the government reported.
   While the Reagan administration lauded Friday's report as signs
that inflation was not heating up, some private economists
expressed worries about what could happen if world oil prices
suddenly rebound.
   The September increase represented a drop from an August
increase of 0.6 percent. For the first nine months, wholesale
prices have been rising at a rate of 4.3 percent.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the inflation
report showed a ``clear downward trend'' indicating inflation was
under control.
   The government also reported Friday that retail sales fell for
the second straight month in September, declining 0.4 percent
because of weakness in auto sales.
   In another sign that the economy was slowing, the Federal
Reserve said the operating rate for America's factories, mines and
utilities was unchanged in September, the first month industrial
production has failed to increase since last February.
   The financial markets took the data in stride. Stock prices rode
out alternating waves of buying and selling to finish little
changed, with the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials losing 0.18
to close at 2,133.18. An initial rally in the bond market ran out
of steam as the dollar fell and oil prices rose.
   In the view of many economists the sluggish reports on retail
sales and industrial production were encouraging signs that the
economy was not in danger of overheating.
   Those worries earlier in the year had prompted the Federal
Reserve, in an inflation-fighting move, to tighten credit
conditions and push interest rates higher.
   ``The good news is that inflation and interest rates have peaked
and should decline in coming months,'' said Richard Rahn, chief
economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``The bad news is not
all that bad. The economy is slowing, but only slightly.''
   Other economists agreed, although some said they were worried
that the underlying inflation rate, after removing the volatile
food and energy categories, jumped by 0.6 percent in September,
double the rate of increase in August.
   Some economists suggested that the central bank is likely to
wait until after the Nov. 8 presidential election and then resume
pushing interest rates higher in a further effort to dampen
consumer demand.
   The big dampening effect on prices last month came from a 3.3
percent drop in energy costs, the biggest decline since January and
a reflection of the rrent battle among oil-producing nations over
production quotas.
   Offsetting the drop in energy costs, food prices jumped by 1.2
percent last month, three times the rate of increase in August.
Another factor pushing prices higher was a 1.8 percent increase in
new automobile prices.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Leap Again</HEAD>

   Oil futures prices have leaped again in reaction
to speculation that OPEC oil producers would reach an agreement on
production cuts at meetings this coming week.
   The November contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, rose 71 cents Friday to settle at $14.92 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Since Tuesday, the November contract has leaped $1.37 a barrel,
reflecting a sharp turnaround in the mood of the market.
   A proposal on the table would cut production by members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to between 18.5
million and 19.5 million barrels a day, said Peter Beutel,
assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc.
   OPEC's production recently has been about 21 million barrels a
day even though the official ceiling is about 19 million barrels.
   ``It's not a fait accompli,'' said Beutel, who said he got his
information from sources. ``These numbers may not come into
existence.''
   Oil traders pushed prices so high in anticipation of an OPEC
accord that if one fails to materialize, prices could fall back
quite rapidly, analysts said.
   The heaviest buying Friday was by traders who had speculated on
a decline in prices and were forced to bail out when the market
turned against them, said Jayne Ball, a trader and analyst at Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The six-member Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes four
OPEC members, is scheduled to meet Sunday in Saudi Arabia. On
Thursday, OPEC's price monitoring committee and long-term strategy
committee are scheduled to meet jointly in Madrid.
   The price of oil skidded in recent weeks _ trading below $12.30
a barrel at one point last week _ because of continued
overproduction by cartel members, and OPEC is trying to construct
an agreement that will lower output and push prices higher.
   In other trading on the exchange Friday, the November contract
for wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 1.27 cents to 45.42 cents a
gallon. The November contract for home heating oil rose 1.46 cents
to settle at 43.21 cents a gallon.
