<HEAD>BART Workers To Strike Monday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A strike by 1,200 Bay Area Rapid Transit
district mechanics, janitors and clerks begins early Monday, union
officials said Thursday, threatening to cripple service for 204,000
daily riders.
   ``The leadership has selected Monday, ... 12:01 a.m. to commence
a strike against the BART district. The pickets will go up at that
time,'' said Suzanne Angeli, vice president of Local 790 of the
United Public Employees Union.
   About 500 train operators and station agents represented by the
Amalgamated Transit Union's Local 1555 will honor the picket lines,
said ATU local leader Hank White.
   Between them, the two unions represent nearly two-thirds of the
employees in the BART system, which carries about 204,000 riders
dayily in three San Francisco Bay area counties.
   Immediately after Local 790's announcement, BART district
officials began re-examining the union's demands and considering
how to keep the system operating, BART spokesman Sy Mouber said.
   ``We will of course begin making plans as to what level of
service we can operate,'' Mouber said. ``A problem we're going to
have is certifying people who are going to be operating the
trains.''
   The district also planned to meet with a mediator Friday
morning, Mouber said, but no new talks were scheduled.
   BART said earlier that if both unions went on strike, its
managers may be able to provide limited train service, as they did
during a 1979 strike.
   Members of Local 790 rejected the public agency's contract offer
Wednesday night by a vote of 464-354.
   The three-year pact calls for a 14 percent increase in pay and
benefits the first year and 3 percent for each of the next two
years, with a one-time cost-of-living payment at the end.
   Non-economic issues, including proposed changes in work rules,
working conditions, safety issues and union rights are at the
center of the dispute, Angeli said. Both unions have criticized the
proposed retirement benefits.
   Local 1555 approved the contract by six votes, 170-164, and
BART's board of directors ratified that agreement on Thursday, but
Local 1555, after meeting with Local 790 late Thursday, reaffirmed
its promise to honor picket lines.
   BART General Manager Keith Bernard said it was ``absolute lunacy
and very irresponsible to seek a strike,'' calling the proposed
contract ``one of the best in the industry today'' and noting that
BART faces a $4.8 million deficit in the current fiscal year.

   A murder suspect who broke his
leg jumping to freedom from a prison wall persuaded guards he was
only visiting the prison and they unwittingly helped him escape,
police said.
   Police spokesman Frans Malherbe said police were investigating
the Aug. 28 escape from Johannesburg's Diepkloof Prison by Michael
Mathebula, 24, who was accused of murder and rape.
   Guards found Mathebula lying beside the prison wall and believed
his story that he was a visitor who broke his leg jumping from a
bus, police said Thursday.
   The guards arranged for an ambulance to take Mathebula to
Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto, where he vanished after being
treated, police said.
   ``If anyone is found to have been negligent, steps will be taken
against him,'' Malherbe said.
   Mathebula also is wanted in the black homeland of Bophuthatswana
on murder charges and four counts of escaping from police custody.

<TEXT>
   The Moody Blues, the British band that
brought an elegance of sound to rock 'n' roll in the 1960s, is
struggling with political in-fighting over its direction and style.
   But Swiss-born keyboardist Patrick Moraz, who joined the band in
1978 with the departure of singer Mike Pinder, says he's confident
its five members can soar above the turmoil ``to write some
incredible material as a group.''
   ``There is a lot of political decisions and policies being made
behind the scenes about who composes what,'' Moraz said in a
telephone interview from Los Angeles prior to a recent concert at
ParkWest Resort near Salt Lake City. ``But that really shouldn't
hinder the fact that we are a group and we are a very good group,
probably one of the best in the world.''
   The group launched a nationwide tour this summer in Cincinnati
to mark the 20th anniversary of the British rockers' first U.S.
tour.
   The outspoken Moraz said he was not happy with the group's
newest album, ``Sur La Mer'' (``On the Sea''), released in the
United States in June. It was weak, he said, and had undergone ``a
corporate approach.''
   He was particularly upset that flutist-singer Ray Thomas, an
original member of The Moody Blues, was not called by the producer
to participate.
   ``I think it's inexcusable, personally. He's a very important
force in The Moody Blues, like all of us,'' Moraz said. The album
is selling moderately well and one of its songs, ``I Know You're
Out There Somewhere,'' was at the top of the pop charts this summer.
   It was 1967 when The Moody Blues delighted millions with the
release of its single, ``Nights in White Satin,'' a haunting,
choir-like love song written by lead singer Justin Hayward. That
was followed by the highly acclaimed and successful album, ``Days
of Future Passed.'' The group had earlier hit the charts with ``Go
Now,'' the No. 1 single in Britain in 1964.
   In their 22 years, The Moody Blues _ the other members are
singer-guitarist John Lodge and drummer Graeme Edge _ have sold
more than 50 million albums and traveled the world time and again
giving concerts and writing songs.
   The group broke up in the early 1970s, but reunited six years
later. In the interim, Hayward and Lodge produced an album, ``Blue
Jays.'' Thomas, Pinder and Lodge each produced albums of their own.
   However, in 1978, the five decided to revive The Moody Blues'
sound. In the course of making ``Octave,'' their 10th album, Pinder
left, and Moraz, with his classical music background and a string
of self-produced albums behind him, was recruited.
   Do the conflicts within the Moody Blues auger badly for the
future?
   ``Conflict always weakens. If the conflict can come to a
self-transformation which calls for growth of creativity and then
fanning that fire so the group would benefit, it's good,'' said
Moraz, a former keyboardist for Yes. ``If a conflict generates into
a bitter ... situation, then obviously it weakens the whole system
and that probably is what happened on this last album.
   ``It's a very simple-type political matter. ... There's a
segment of egos out there and that weakens the whole thing. And a
group like The Moody Blues should show the example because they put
it in their songs. So why can't we apply it to our lives and our
artistic life as a group?''
   Despite the disagreements, The Moody Blues have no intention of
breaking up again.
   ``I mean, things happen all the time with rock 'n' roll groups
and everything. But after 22 years of almost living happily ever
after ... there's no reason why we should do that,'' he said.
   ``No, no, no. We all are conscious of our own mistakes and
everybody makes mistakes. I'm absolutely positive the group will
stay together.''
   Said lead singer Justin Hayward in an earlier interview with The
Associated Press: ``We might go on forever. There is no such thing
as retirement as far as we are concerned. After all, what would we
do then?''

<HEAD>Land Costs, Traffic Jams Change Face Of Historic Amsterdam</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rising land costs and traffic
jams of modern Amsterdam are changing the face of the ``Canal
Belt,'' the city's cultural and economic core since the middle of
the 14th century.
   The industry that has operated there for centuries has moved to
the suburbs, leaving behind a 35-percent employment rate in the
area and bringing yuppy-like gentrification and skyrocketing rents
to neighborhoods that hadn't changed much since the 17th century.
   The latest and the last of the industries to depart was Klene's
candy factory, which had permeated its neighborhood with the
distinct aroma of licorice since it opened in 1915.
   Klene's factory moved to a modern, $9.5-million plant in Hoorn,
20 miles north.
   ``We left for a number of reasons, but the catastrophic traffic
situation here was the most important one,'' said Hans Hilarius,
Klene's managing director.
   The company serves about 10 percent of the Dutch licorice market
with yearly sales amounting to the guilder equivalent of $4 million.
   As Klene's output more than tripled over the past decade,
getting the ingredients _ mainly sugar and starch _ in and the
licorice and peppermint out became an almost impossible task
because of the Canal Belt's old narrow streets, Hilarius said in a
recent interview.
   ``The daily average was five 20-ton trucks with raw materials
and the finished product a day,'' said Hilarius. The trucks had to
run an obstacle course of traffic jams on the 8-foot wide street
along the Looiersgracht Canal.
   Industrial activity within Amsterdam's city center had been
declining since the mid-1960s, when the city developed huge
industrial zones in the deep-water port area west of the city.
   But development of the industrial zone was stunted by the 1973
oil crisis recession.
   Instead of industrial giants coming in, it was small to
medium-sized businesses that took refuge from heavy traffic and
high land leases in the city-owned industrial zones. City leases,
which serve as a sort of real estate tax, have increased from the
equivalent of $1.20 a square foot in 1978 to $4 now.
   An Amsterdam Chamber of Commerce survey indicated that during
the last eight months of 1986, more than 800 such firms moved ut of
the 2.3-square-mile Canl Belt, taking with them them some 2,200
jobs.
   Among the major departures was the Heineken brewery, which
shifted its main brewery to Zoeterwoude, 25 miles south of the
capital, and kept only its head office and a demonstration plant
for tourist tours in the capital.
   ``It worries us greatly that 35 percent of the city center's
work force is now unemployed,'' said Chamber of Commerce chairman
Rob de Vilder, ``and most of the companies that left employed
low-grade labor.''
   Amsterdam's average unemployment rate is 18.4 percent, well
above the national figure of 14 percent. Klene's 85-member work
force was made up of unskilled laborers.
   Hilarius said he unsuccessfully tried to buy city land for a new
plant in the cramped city center. City Hall spokesman Harald Ytsma
said, however, no municipal land had been sold since 1896, when the
city adopted a lease-only policy to have tighter control over land
use.
   Part of the area's unemployment problem stems from the
traditional reluctance of Dutch workers to commute to jobs outside
their own cities, with the majority of the commuting class white
collar employees.
   De Vilder of the Chamber of Commerce minimizes the problem of
industry abandoning the city center, saying other, smaller business
are taking its place.
   ``The city is losing lots of unskilled jobs, but on the other
hand, thousands of small businesses are opening their doors every
year,'' he said.
   ``What is industrial activity? In our view, a small computer
repair company also is industrial activity, and such firms abound
in the inner city.''
   That shift has prompted a gentrification that is turning
historic working-class neighborhoods like the canal-woven Jordaan
into upscale neighborhoods.
   With most city jobs now in the banking, commerce, media and
tourism sectors, De Vilder says, unskilled workers should be
induced to commute to out-of-town jobs.
   But blue collar attachment to inner city neighborhoods is often
stronger than the draw of jobs in a strange city.
   One elderly Jordaan woman signalled that bittersweet attachment
when she told a new white-collar neighbor, ``If it weren't for
people like you, my son could afford to live in this neighborhood.''

   Marshall Field's is the homegrown favorite in
this city's retail game. Now an invader from New York will sell its
wares on Michigan Avenue, raising a question for people with power
in their pocketbooks.
   ``Gosh, dahling, what's a shopper to do?''
   Bloomingdale's _ Big Apple boss, Gotham giant, 59th Street
strongman _ is opening Saturday a six-floor home a few blocks from
Lake Michigan, and there is gleeful speculation around town about
which retailer will have the registers ringing.
   ``For a while there will be blood in the streets,'' says Bill
Zwecker, a society columnist who monitors the pulse of Chicago's
upper crust for the Skyline weekly newspaper.
   ``Most people recognize this is a Bloomingdale's-Field's
battle,'' he said. ``It's been building up to a crescendo. There
has been an electricity to this arrival that I have never seen.''
   And when it comes to keeping customers happy, a little partying
can't hurt.
   Field's threw a benefit for the Lyric Opera of Chicago on Sept.
9 that was attended by 1,200 people. The gathering also celebrated
the $10 million renovation at Field's Water Tower store _ just a
brisk stroll from the new kid on the block.
   Partygoers clinked glasses with designers Bill Blass, Louis
Dell'Olio and Carolina Herrera as Field's brought out the heavy
artillery to woo the local elite.
   Bloomingdale's opening fete is Friday, and 2,500 people have
been invited to its benefit for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.
   Invited guests will hear soothing strings, big band sounds and
contemporary rock on all six floors of the store. They will eat
Petrossian smoked salmon and sip fine wines and French champagne.
   The lineup of French couturiers attending will be headed by Karl
Lagerfeld.
   ``There will be plenty of people who will try to crash,''
Zwecker said. ``The people-watching will be unequaled.''
   That's fine with ``Bloomie's,'' as the retailer is
affectionately known in New York and eight other states. Chairman
Marvin Traub wants to make a big splash in the Windy City.
   The store's design was influenced by another local favorite,
Frank Lloyd Wright, the Oak Park architect whose Prairie Style
peppers Chicago and the suburbs. Five floors match various Wright
designs, including the Robie House, the Arizona Biltmore and
Tokyo's Imperial Hotel.
   When doors open to shoppers Saturday, the store will feature
guest appearances by some of the top names in fashion: Isaac
Mizrahi, Patricia Pastor and Paloma Picasso.
   General Manager Brian McMahon says Bloomingdale's will be
staffed by people who will earn only commissions on sales _ no
salary _ a first for the 17-store chain and a policy believed to
improve customer service.
   ``You name the store in the city of Chicago, we've ben able to
get the best people and bring them in,'' he said of recruiting a
sales team. ``It's only going to be a coup if we exercise the
service well.
   ``This market has created more interest in a store opening than
any I've ever been connected with, and I've lived in Washington,
New York and Boston,'' McMahon said.
   ``It's certainly uplifting, but I've tried to tell everybody to
retain a high level of humility. There's nothing worse than
building up a crescendo, believing your own press and then having a
shopper come in and say, `This isn't what I expected.'''
   At Marshall Field's, reaction to Bloomingdale's opening is
low-key.
   ``Our game plan is to compete effectively against all
competitors, and Bloomingdale's is one them,'' said Gary Witkin,
executive vice president.
   ``I think our attitude about business is no different today than
it was a year ago.''

   It's been three years since Ryan White's highly publicized
battle to go to school in Indiana, and three years since another
child with AIDS quietly entered schools in Massachusetts.
   For children infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, the
same uncertainty remains. Some started classes with little or no
fuss this year, while a boy in Illinois who has already fled one
town faced more protests in his new home.
   ``AIDS Kills,'' said one sign carried by protesters in Illinois.
``Help Keep AIDS Out of Our Schools,'' said another.
   ``We don't want to be in the spotlight. I don't want to be a
civil rights activist,'' says Tammie Robertson, whose 8-year-old
son Jason hopes to enter school in South Roxana, Ill.
   In Lakewood, Colo., and St. Albans, W.Va., 5-year-olds with AIDS
entered kindergarten classes with no fuss.
   However, there were some protests in another Colorado school
when parents learned that an 8-year-old who had tested positive for
the AIDS antibody, an indicator of exposure, was attending classes.
   Kay Pride, spokeswoman for Jefferson County schools, said state
law requires school officials to keep the child's identity
confidential. However, she said it is school policy to notify
parents whose children attend the same school as a child who has
been exposed to the AIDS virus.
   The Centers for Disease Control issued guidelines three years
ago saying there was apparently no risk within a classroom of
contracting AIDS, which is transmitted by sexual contact, sharing
infected hypodermic needles or receiving a transfusion of
contaminated blood.
   Of the more than 72,000 AIDS cases confirmed since June 1981,
the CDC says not one was transmitted within a school.
   President Reagan's commission on AIDS, headed by Adm. James D.
Watkins, affirmed earlier this year that ``there is no need to
treat those infected with HIV in a manner different from those not
infected in such settings as the workplace, housing and the
schools.''
   ``We've won all the cases. The case law is pretty clear, that
there is no reason to exclude HIV children,'' says William
Rubenstein, staff counsel for the AIDS and Civil Liberties Project
of the American Civil Liberties Union.
   Winning the case, however, isn't always enough. Ryan White won
his legal fight to attend school in Russiaville, Ind., but gave up
in the face of protests. Jason Robertson won a court order last
school year to join classes in Granite City, Ill., but his family
also decided to move.
   John McCarthy, superintendent of schools in Swansea, Mass.,
presided over the peaceful admission of an AIDS victim in 1985.
   ``The fear the parents have is that the child who is attending
school with AIDS could pass the disease on to their children,''
McCarthy said. ``That's impossible. So what you do is talk about
how infection with AIDS occurs, and that the people who should
answer questions like that are medical people.
   ``Beyond that, I don't know what you can say. Incidental contact
is not the way this disease is spread,'' McCarthy said. ``You
either believe it or you don't.''
   In West Virginia this year, Kanawha County school officials
carefully laid the ground: 5,000 AIDS information pamphlets were
distributed around St. Albans, county health officials conducted
AIDS workshops for school employees and a county health department
nurse held workshops at each school.
   Kanawha County School Superintendent Richard D. Trubla thanked
local media for providing information about AIDS which was
``accurate and to the point, but not sensational.''
   Charles Conner, superintendent of schools in South Roxana, said
the objections to Jason's attendance come mainly from ``a minority
group of parents ... in need of further education.''
   In the most prominent case this year, a federal judge in Florida
ordered that a mentally retarded 6-year-old girl be admitted to a
special education program but only if she was confined in a
Plexiglas box.
   The judge said the child, who has an advanced case of AIDS
acquired through a blood transfusion in Puerto Rico, should be
isolated until she became toilet-trained and learned to stop
sucking her thumb and forefingers. The girl is being educated at
home while her case is appealed.
   Rubenstein said the ACLU's involvement with the school-AIDS
issue has shifted from the courts to lobbying school boards as they
draft regulations for handling the admission of infected students.
   The National Association of Boards of Education is close to
completing work on model guidelines which would permit HIV-infected
students to be admitted the same as any other student, said
Katherine Fraser, co-director of the association's Aids Education
Project.
   An important component of those guidelines is guaranteeing
confidentiality for the student.
   ``There is no particular reaons why people in a school setting
need to know that there is an HIV-infected person in the school,''
she said. ``In most cases, there is no need for parents to know.''

   The International Imitation Hemingway
Competition that had graced the clean, well-lighted environs of a
bar in Century City has been discontinued, officials announced
Thursday.
   The contest, sponsored by Harry's Bar and American Grill for the
past 11 years, has yielded thousands of dialogues, love letters and
character sketches about bulls, bars, misplaced snow leopards and
other topics writer Ernest Hemingway would have approved of.
   ``Quite frankly, the time and management commitment, in addition
to the cost of the competition, have just outgrown our resources,''
Charles A. Frank, president of Spectrum Foods Inc., which owns and
operates Harry's, said in a tersely written statement.
   ``I feel it is much better to end the event on a high note, with
11 successful years enjoyed by those who have entered,'' Frank said.
   The contest was created to promote Harry's, named after Harry's
Bar in Venice, Italy, where Hemingway often went drinking.
   Contest winners won two round-trip plane tickets to Florence,
Italy and dinner at Harry's Bar in that city.
   Somewhere in the ``one really good page of really `bad'
Hemingway,'' it was required to mention Harry's Bar nicely.

<TEXT>
   Dozens of prominent leftists are
returning from exile to join the campaign against military
President Augusto Pinochet, but some are bringing embarrassment as
well as enthusiasm to the opposition.
   Police said Wednesday that 53 of the 504 leftists affected by
Pinochet's Sept. 1 decision to end all official exile have returned
home.
   The list includes prominent members of the leftist government of
President Salvador Allende, ousted by Pinochet in a bloody 1973
coup, and leaders of Marxist parties that supported it.
   Most of the returning exiles have declared support for an
opposition campaign to defeat Pinochet in an Oct. 5 presidential
referendum. But some are also making radical statements that
conflict with the opposition's campaign strategy.
   In the referendum, 7.4 million registered voters will vote on a
proposal by the country's military commanders that Pinochet remain
in power until 1997.
   If a majority vote yes, Pinochet will start a new eight-year
term next March 11. If the no vote prevails, an open election will
be called next year and Pinochet will hand over power to the winner
in 1990.
   A 16-party coalition is busily campaigning for Pinochet's defeat.
   Images of joyful dissidents returning to their homeland after
more than a decade in exile have provided an emotional charge to
campaign.
   A huge airport crowd is expected Saturday for the scheduled
arrival of Allende's widow, Hortensia Bussi.
   Allende died in the takeover, and his wife fled the country days
later, emerging as a major critic of Pinochet. Her visit is
expected to give the opposition a major boost.
   But some of the exiles appear too outspoken for the moderate
opposition's tastes.
   Volodia Teitelboim, a former senator and a leader of the
proscribed Communist Party, returned on Tuesday from exile in
Moscow and promptly criticized the opposition strategy.
   He said it lacks ``real unity'' because the Communists are
excluded from the coalition, whose members range from the
center-right to socialist left.
   He also criticized six parties from the right to the center-left
for joining in a coalition to form a moderate transition government
in case Pinochet loses.
   The new coalition, announced Wednesday and led by the moderate
Christian Democratic party, the nation's largest, said its goal is
to offer Chileans ``an alternative of government for the first
democatic period'' after Pinochet.
   The opposition leaders have carefully avoided comment on the
remarks by Teitelboim and others.
   Patricio Aylwin, president of the Christian Democrats, asked
about Teitelboim's criticism, replied only, ``the Communist Party
is not a member of our coalition.''
   Genaro Arriagada, secretary-general of the coalition, recently
defended the leftists' ``inalienable right'' to return to their
homeland when they chose, even if it might not be the best moment
for their arrival.
   ``We have no moral right to ask that they postpone their
return,'' he said at a news conference.
   Pro-government media are enthusiastically selecting and
broadcasting some statements by the returning exiles to emphasize
its claim that the opposition is dominated by the extreme left.
   When Mario Palestro, a radical Socialist ex-congressman,
returned to Chile last week, he paid homage ``to my comrades'' of
the Leftist Revolutionary Movement, a guerrilla band. He warned
that, when ``the people'' recover power, many right-wingers will
have ``to flee the country like rabbits.''
   Since then, government political ads on television have
repeatedly shown Palestro making his fierce speech upon arrival at
the airport.
   Maria Eugenia Oyarzun, a pro-government political commentator,
said in the newspaper La Tercera last Sunday that the returning
exiles are ruining the opposition's efforts to cultivate an image
of moderation.
   Defense Minister Adm. Patricio Carvajal said on Wednesday: ``I
think it's very good that these people are returning, so Chileans
can see the the continued disorder and split within the
opposition.''

<TEXT>
   Akihito, the quiet, dapper prince who is assuming
his ailing father's duties, has gently parted the inscrutable veil
that once shrouded Japan's monarchy.
   The eldest son of the reclusive Emperor Hirohito is a
globe-trotting diplomat without portfolio, a weekend tennis player
whose youthful driver's license identified him simply as ``Akihito
Shinno'' _ Prince Akihito.
   ``People still stand in awe of the emperor, but there is a real
sense of intimacy with the crown prince and princess,'' said Yasuo
Shigeta, Akihito's longtime chamberlain.
   The 54-year-old prince is the first monarch schooled among
commoners and will be the first to ascend the Chrysanthemum Throne
as a human and not a living god.
   On his own, Akihito has set a number of other imperial
precedents: first to court and marry a commoner, first to raise his
own children, first to throw out the first ball at a baseball game,
first to actively shoulder the extensive globe-trotting duties of
an increasingly outward-looking Japan.
   ``I want to be a man with a strong moral backbone with keen,
reliable insight and knowledge,'' a friend quoted him as saying.
``I want to shake up the imperial protocol system.''
   He did just that with his marriage in 1959 to Michiko Shoda, the
beautiful, cultured daughter of a wealthy miller. The prince
courted her by phone, in long conversations that piqued the
curiosity of a public once excluded from imperial life. Their
wedding cavalcade drew half a million well-wishers onto the streets
of Tokyo.
   Akihito and Michiko have three children _ Prince Hiro, 28;
Prince Aya, 22; and Princess Nori, 19.
   The prince's style is different from that of his father, a
frail, stooped man who made his obligatory public appearances but
never seemed comfortable at them. Hirohito's Showa reign _ the
``era of enlightenment and peace'' _ began with his enthronement as
a living god on Christmas Day 1926.
   Akihito, born Dec. 23, 1933, was a boy when Japan's most
ambitious military campaign of the century ended in disaster in
1945. Japan was shattered, its cities firebombed and its people
starving when Hirohito went on the radio to tell a stunned nation
it had to accept surrender.
   At the urging of U.S. Occupation authorities, Hirohito renounced
his divinity on New Year's Day 1946 and accepted a new
constitutional role as ``the symbol of the state and of the unity
of the people, deriving his position from the will of the people.''
   It was the 12-year-old prince's new legacy. ``The imperial
family should always be passive,'' he would say later. ``The most
important thing is the will of the people.''
   Akihito was formally invested as crown prince in 1952, and the
next year he began a six-month tour of Europe and America by
representing his father at the coronation of Britain's Queen
Elizabeth II.
   His education included precedent-setting attendance at ordinary
schools and Gakushin University as well as tutoring in English,
European languages, law and history. Like his marine biologist
father, science is a major hobby and he has delivered scientific
papers on the goby fish, a mudsucker.
   The graying, 5-foot-5 prince appears often among his subjects at
ceremonies and festivals, smiling, nodding politely, delivering
carefully tailored speeches in a measured, high-pitched lisp.
   Akihito has spent 54 years preparing for his reign. Its name, to
be chosen by government officials, is a closely kept secret. For
many Japanese it will be the symbolic start of a modern era, free
of the fetters of war memories that plagued Hirohito.
   His son has also tasted the bitterness of survivors who fought a
hopeless war in the name of the emperor. In Okinawa, site of the
Pacific War's fiercest fighting between Japanese and American
troops, 1,600 people turned out to demonstrate last year against
Hirohito's first scheduled visit to the island.
   Instead, Akihito read a statement on behalf of his father.
   ``I feel great sadness and pain when I think of how Okinawa
suffered tremendous damage in the war ... produced a large number
of honorable victims, including ordinary residents, and was forced
to suffer numerous hardships for a long time after the war,'' he
read.
   Some leftists, religious groups and war victims continue to
oppose the existence of the Japanese monarchy. For Akihito it has
never been a question of choice.
   Asked once by his American Quaker schoolteacher, the late
Elizabeth Vining, what he would be when he grew up, the boy prince
replied, ``I will become emperor.''
   Last year, at a rare reception with American journalists, he
confided, ``I don't think I have ever considered what I would wish
to do, as I don't have the experiences of a regular Japanese
citizen and I can't imagine being able to choose another way of
life.''

   Here are some facts and figures on
Lebanon:
   THE LAND _ Lebanon lies in the eastern Mediterranean and covers
4,034 square miles. From a narrow coastal strip, the land rises
steeply into the Mt. Lebanon range with the highest peak at Qurnet
al-Sawdah, 9,000 feet.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ Moslems make up around 55 percent of the estimated
3 million population and Christians, once considerd the majority,
make up about 45 percent. Lebanon has 17 religious sects, with the
biggest the million-strong Shiite Moslems. The country's makeup,
which has contributed to much of Lebanon's sectarian bloodshed,
reflects the waves of people who fled persecution and took refuge
in the rugged mountains through the centuries. About 500,000
Palestinian refugees live in Lebanon.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Lebanon has no natural resources, so the people
have since ancient times turned to commerce. The most prominent
were the Phoenicians. Before the civil war began in 1975, Lebanon
was the financial center of the Middle East with one of the
strongest currencies. It was also a major tourist center. The war
has gutted the economy.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Some Lebanese claim descent from the Phoenicians who
lived in the area 6,000 years ago. The Assyrians, Persians, Romans,
Byzantines, Crusaders, Mamalukes and Arabs all have ruled what is
now Lebanon until it fell under the Ottoman empire in the 16th
century. Ottoman rule ended with World War I. Lebanon was put under
a French mandate until independence in 1943. The Christians
dominated, but Moslem demands for political reforms helped trigger
the civil war in 1975. An estimated 150,000 people have been killed
in the fighting and intervention by the Syrians, Israelis and the
United States. The war has dismembered Lebanon into sectarian
cantons, as well as sectors controlled by Syria and Israel, leaving
Lebanon a country in name only.

<HEAD>Government Says S&L Industry Suffering Most Since Depression</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The savings industry, dragged down by
continuing big losses in Texas, is headed for its worst year since
the Great Depression, according to a government report.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Thursday that the nation's
thrift institutions lost $7.5 billion in the first six months of
1988, almost as much as the $7.8 billion loss for all of last year,
a post-Depression record.
   ``The losses for the year are clearly going to exceed the record
losses of last year,'' said Martin Regalia, an economist with the
National Council of Savings Institutions, a trade group.
   ``I would say there is a very good chance we're going to see
losses in the $10 billion to $11 billion range and maybe more,'' he
said.
   But, both Regalia and James Barth, the bank board's chief
economist, point to signs that the industry is at least not
deteriorating as rapidly as before.
   The S&Ls' loss for the April-June period of $3.6 billion was
modestly better than the $3.9 billion of red ink in the first
quarter and the $4.0 billion loss in the last quarter of 1987.
   ``Things are clearly not getting better rapidly, but they're not
pitching off into the abyss,'' Regalia said.
   As in the past, the industry's losses in the second quarter were
concentrated in a relatively small number of institutions and in
Texas, which has been hard hit by the collapse of oil prices.
   The 271 thrift institutions in Texas _ 133 of them insolvent _
accounted for $3.2 billion of the loss. The 20 worst institutions
in the nation _ 17 of them in Texas _ lost $2.6 billion.
   Barth said most of the second-quarter loss came when
institutions wrote down bad loans already in their portfolios. He
said operating income was in the black, by $225 million, for the
first time since the third quarter of last year. That means the
industry is earning more than it's paying in operating expenses.
   Barth said he suspects there are more loan writedowns, or
non-operating losses, to come, but he said, ``I like to think we
have bottomed out and things won't get much worse.''
   In Texas, the vacancy and unemployment rates in the state have
edged down and construction and oil-drilling activity are up, Barth
said.
   The number of insolvent institutions among 3,092 reporting
slipped from 509 to 497, and the percentage of money-losing
institutions fell slightly from 31 percent to 29 percent.
   Barth declined to offer an assessment of how the industry is
faring in the current quarter, but he noted that about $800 million
of the second-quarter loss occurred at 60 institutions that have
since been closed.
   The institutions' unrealized losses do not go away, but they are
transferred onto the books of the government insurance fund for
S&Ls and do not add to the industry's red ink.
   However, there is at least one factor ahead that could generate
new losses, Regalia said. The Federal Reserve Board, in an effort
to fight inflation, has been pushing up interest rates since last
March and most economists expect rates to continue to rise during
the first half of 1989.
   ``We shouldn't see interest rates hurting earnings this year.
There is a lag effect. But, we should see it by the first half of
next year,'' he said.
   The bank board's earnings report comes as debate is intensifying
about the need for a taxpayer bailout of the Federal Savings and
Loan Insurance Corp., which guarantees S&L deposits up to $100,000.
   The General Accounting Office said last week that $45 billion to
$50 billion will have to be spent to clean up the industry, and
private projections range up to $100 billion.
   Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire, D-Wis., said
Thursday that taxpayers will have to contribute at least $20
billion to solve the problem.
   At a time when the administration is struggling to reduce the
federal budget deficit, the question of how much must be spent on
S&Ls is becoming increasingly critical.

<HEAD>Mexican, Oriental Big Influences at National Beef Cookoff</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The days of the big slab of beef are over,
replaced by exotic ethnic recipes featuring bite-size pieces more
palatable to health-conscious Americans, according to cooks at the
National Beef Cookoff.
   Sixty-two of the best beef cooks in the nation brought their
favorite pans, woks and ladles to the Deep South this week in
search of the title of best beef cook in the nation and the $15,000
grand prize.
   And most were betting on recipes with an international flavor
and smaller pieces of meat.
   ``There's still quite a strong sustained Mexican influence.
Oriental is also coming through, but not just the typical stir
fry,'' said Marlys Bielunski, director of test kitchens and
editorial services for the National Livestock and Meat Board, a
sponsor of the contest.
   John Michels of St. Paul, Minn., won the contest Thursday with a
recipe for ``Oriental Shortrib Barbecue.'' The judges said they
selected the recipe entered by the general contractor and carpenter
because it uses a new beef cut, ``Flanken-style Beef Shortribs.''
The new cut is a shortrib that can be quickly cooked on the grill.
   For a second straight year, more recipes called for smaller
portions of beef, with 40 percent of the recipes using cubed or
stripped beef, organizers said.
   ``Anything that is in small pieces cooks much faster and can be
cooked in a lot more ways,'' Bielunski said Thursday. ``It can also
be used in more types of dishes. We have a lot of salads this
year.''
   A warm beef and black-eye pea salad from the California took
last year's overall prize and this year's California contestant was
following her predecessor's lead.
   Janet Hill, 34, of Sacramento, made Breezy Fiesta Beef Salad for
the judges in the microwave category. Hill's salad featured
marinated sirloin with avocados, grapefruit, olives and cilantro.
   ``It's a Tex-Mex, California salad,'' said Hill, who has
competed in the Pillsbury Bakeoff twice and won a number of smaller
contests. ``I didn't want to enter just any beef dish. I wanted
something that would represent the West.''
   The rules of the contest favor recipes such as Hill's.
   Taste counted for 40 points out of 100, but ease of preparation
and originality counted for a combined 50 points with 10 points for
appearance.
   A $5,000 first-place prize was awarded in each of three
categories, conventional, barbecue and microwave, with a $10,000
bonus awarded the the overall winner.
   Other exotic recipes presented to the judges Thursday included
Tunisian Meatballs, Strip Steaks with Roquefort Spread and
Mediterranean Beef Kabobs with Grilled Pitas and Dilled Vegetables.
   Bucking the trend was Albert Boesl, 82, of Williamsville, N.Y.,
the oldest entrant. The New England Region entrant prepared Special
O'Cajun Beef Ribeye Roast for the judges, a group of food editors
and writers.
   Boesl's recipe calls for a four-pound roast to be rubbed with a
variety of spices and put on the barbeque for over an hour. The
octogenarian said he really doesn't listen to health advocates who
advise him to cut down on red meat consumption.
   ``Well, beef never bothered me,'' the retired utility worker
said. ``I exercise a lot, and you have to have meat to keep up your
strength.''

   A jury that convicted a former Mexican
policeman in the 1985 kidnap and torture murder of a U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration agent returned to deliberate on the
guilt or innocence of two co-defendants.
   The panel convicted Raul Lopez Alvarez on Thursday. Lopez was
videotaped telling an undercover officer about events surrounding
the brutal murder of DEA agent Enrique Camarena, whose battered
body was found along with that of his pilot at a ranch outside
Guadalajara on March 5, 1985.
   On the videotape, the former Mexican lawman described the
slaying of Camarena as a mistake by drug baron Rafael Caro
Quintero, adding, ``The idea wasn't to kill him.''
   After a single day's deliberation, the jury found Lopez, 28,
guilty of kidnap, murder, conspiracy and related crimes in the
killing of Camarena and pilot Alfredo Zavala Avelar.
   Jurors announced their first verdict Thursday morning, then
resumed deliberating for a full day.
   They recessed without deciding the cases of two co-defendants,
Rene Verdugo Urquidez, 36, a confessed drug trafficker, and Jesus
Felix Guttierez who is charged as an accessory after the fact.
   The government alleges that Guttierez helped the drug baron
escape from Mexico after Caro allegedly masterminded Camarena's
murder as revenge for DEA raids on the drug baron's multimillion
dollar marijuana operations in Mexico.
   Lopez, who grew up in the Los Angeles area but returned to his
native Mexico, was a member of the state judicial police assigned
to the homicide squad in Guadalajara in 1985.
   The role of Mexican police in the drug-related murders made the
case politically sensitive and engendered bitter feelings between
Mexican and American investigators.
   Lopez was found guilty of six charges, including two counts of
committing violent acts in support of racketeering.
   Prosecutors said this conviction was the first in the nation
under that new section of racketeering law aimed at drug-related
crimes.
   Lopez also was found guilty of conspiracy to kidnap, kidnapping,
felony murder and accessory after the fact.
   Lopez' lawyer, Yolanda Barrera, told jurors in final arguments
that Lopez fabricated the story heard on the videotape from
accounts he read in newspapers to inflate his own importance to the
agent he believed was a drug dealer.
   She said the only evidence against him was ``his mouth'' and
urged jurors not to believe his statements.
   ``Mr. Lopez Alvarez ended up in this trial for acting like a
child,'' she said. ``He is a man caught up in the web of his own
lies. He told one lie too many.''
   U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie set Lopez's sentencing for
Oct. 24. He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.
   Camarena was abducted Feb. 7, 1985, in Guadalajara as he left
the U.S. Consulate to meet his wife for lunch.
   The bodies of Camarena and his pilot were found buried at a
remote ranch. They were severely beaten and Camarena's skull was
crushed.
   Nine men were indicted in Los Angeles in the Camarena slaying,
but only three are standing trial here. Caro, 33, and three other
defendants are in custody and awaiting trial on related charges in
Mexico. An eighth man has died and another is a fugitive.

   One senator was perplexed that it costs more
to fly across South Dakota than across the country.
   Another said it now costs him $510 to fly home, more than four
times as much as 10 years ago _ and accommodations are not as good.
   And a third suggested there's something wrong when an airline
controls more than 80 percent of the flights in and out of a city.
   The flaws of a deregulated airline industry came under fire
Thursday at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing where no one
expressed support for returning to the tight government control of
years past, but many suggested that some fine tuning may be in
order.
   ``My fares have zoomed up, up and away, and my service has gone
down,'' said Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., chairman of the panel.
He charged that in some parts of the country, airlines ``have
developed monopoly hubs'' that allows them to charge passengers
more for less.
   But Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley disagreed and declared
that while the industry may have ``flaws,'' overall it ``has become
much more competitive as to price and service as a result of
economic deregulation.''
   Since 1978, when Congress enacted the Airline Deregulation Act,
domestic air travel has grown from 275 million passengers a year to
more than 450 million a year, while average fares have declined 13
percent after inflation is taken into account.
   But the national statistical averages did little to sooth the
senators from states where, they contend, air travel has not
improved and is now more costly.
   Hollings said it now costs him $510 to fly from Washington to
Charleston, S.C., compared with $120 in 1977, before deregulation.
   An airline ticket from Aberdeen S.D., to Rapid City, S.D., costs
$269, while a Washington to Los Angeles ticket can cost $269,
complained Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D.
   ``That is a very bizarre situation,'' he said.
   Sen. John Danforth of Missouri, ranking Republican on the
committee, suggested that ``competition doesn't really exist'' in
cities such as St. Louis, Minneapolis, Detroit or Pittsburgh where
single airlines dominate.
   Congress must determine ``whether deregulation is truly working
and if it's not working, what are we supposed to do about it,''
said Danforth, complaining that in some parts of the country,
single air carriers have gained ``a lock'' on an airport, leaving
them free to raise prices and cut service.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, issued a report earlier in the week saying that 82
percent of the flights in and out of St. Louis are controlled by
Trans World Airlines. Similar concentrations can be found at
Minneapolis-St. Paul and Detroit where Northwest Airlines is
dominant and at Pittsburgh, which is the key hub for USAir, the
critics argued.
   But Burnley said that while he is disappointed more competition
to TWA has not entered the St. Louis market, there is still room
for competitors at those airports.
   ``Not only has new entry (by airlines) occurred at each of these
hubs, but competing incumbent carriers continue to provide
competitive service,'' he maintained.
   But when pressed by Danforth, Burnley said the department had
expected more competition to TWA at St. Louis. When the department
approved the TWA-Ozark merger, he said, it had been expected that
Southwest Airlines would expand its St. Louis operation to as much
as 60 flights a day, but the airline today has fewer than two dozen
flights a day into the city.
   ``I'd like to know why that has occurred,'' said Burnley,
promising the department he would examine the competitive situation
at the airport.
   In separate testimony, the architect of airline deregulation,
Alfred Kahn, said he has serious concerns about the mergers that
have resulted in large airlines dominating some markets, but that
overall, ``the airline industry is today far more competitive than
it was under regulation.''
   Kahn, who was chairman of the now-defunct Civil Aeronautics
Board in 1978 when airline deregulation was put in place,
recommended tougher enforcement of antitrust laws.
   But he conceded, ``It's too late to close the barn door on
(airline) mergers now.''

<HEAD>Prosecutor Urges Imprisonment For Deaver In Perjury Case</HEAD>

   The prosecutor in lobbyist Michael K. Deaver's
perjury trial says the former presidential aide should be
imprisoned for lying under oath about his ``cynical exploitation''
of his White House connections.
   Independent counsel Whitney North Seymour Jr. told U.S. District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson that a prison term ``will have a
deterrent effect on the ethics and conduct of political insiders.''
   ``A sentence of incarceration will warn them that being caught
lying under oath about their activities will result in their going
to prison,'' Seymour said in a memo submitted for today's
sentencing.
   Deaver, 50, former deputy White House chief of staff, was
convicted last December of lying to the House Energy and Commerce
oversight and investigations subcommittee and a federal grand jury
impaneled at his request to consider allegations that his lobbying
violated federal conflict-of-interest laws.
   Deaver faced a possible five-year prison term and a $6,800 fine
for each of the three convictions.
   His lawyers were expected to argue at today's hearing that their
client should receive a lenient sentence because of his successful
battle with alcoholism.
   A jury found Deaver guilty of lying when he told the grand jury
he couldn't recall contacting Reagan administration officials on
behalf of major corporations that paid him six-figure fees to
represent their interests in Washington.
   A longtime friend of President Reagan and his wife, Nancy,
Deaver also was convicted of lying by denying he helped South
Korean trade envoy Kim Kihwan get a brief Oval Office appointment
to hand Reagan a personal letter from President Chun Doo-hwan.
   Seymour said evidence at the trial about Deaver's lobbying
``revealed a pattern of cynical exploitation of the governmental
process as a vehicle for private gain.''
   ``If the president's friend can get away with perjury, then the
field is wide open for every one in the privileged class to do the
same,'' the prosecutor said.
   Seymour has recommended eliminating what he called loopholes in
federal ethics laws that prevented him from prosecuting Deaver for
substantive conflict-of-interest violations.
   The prosecutor said Deaver's activities were typical of
```government consultants' ... who potentially threaten the
integrity of government by back door access to public agencies.''
   During the trial, prosecutors presented evidence that Deaver
contacted a number of high government officials, including
Secretary of State George Shultz and then-Secretary of
Transportation Elizabeth Dole, on behalf of major corporations that
paid his firm six-figure retainer fees.
   Last week, Seymour dismissed defense contentions that Deaver's
memory was clouded by alcoholism, arguing that he showed
``extraordinary recall'' about many events about which he was
questioned.

<HEAD>House Speaker Keeps Up Criticism Of CIA Role In Nicaragua</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Ethics committee to meet in closed session at 10 a.m. EDT;
top prospects uncertain.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright is continuing to
criticize CIA efforts to promote unrest in Nicaragua and seeking to
focus attention on what he calls misguided Reagan administration
policies, while Republicans upbraid him for revealing government
secrets.
   The House ethics committee was meeting today to consider an
official complaint against Wright, D-Texas, that questioned whether
the speaker violated House rules prohibiting disclosure of
classified information when he first disclosed the covert CIA
operation on Tuesday.
   Ethics committee chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., said the panel
would have to act on the complaint by House GOP Leader Robert
Michel of Illinois, and Republican Conference chairman Dick Cheney
of Wyoming. But he said the issue would be treated separately from
an existing ethics probe of Wright on unrelated matters.
   The matter was likely to be complicated by the sensitive nature
of the information involved. Michel said if an investigation were
launched, ethics committee staff members would have to gain
top-secret security clearance to be permitted access to any
relevant information.
   Speaking to reporters Thursday, Wright denied that he had broken
any rules or revealed classified information. His disclosure that
the CIA has instigated demonstrations in Nicaragua aimed at
provoking the leftist government could have been gleaned from
information available publicly, he contended.
   ``I didn't say anything that was revealed to me as classified
information,'' Wright said.
   But Wright was vague when asked how he learned of the covert
operation, instead seeking to focus attention on what he called the
error of the policy itself.
   ``In late August of last year I became aware that elements of
the U.S. government were seeking to disturb the domestic
tranquility in Central America, to foment disturbances with a view
to seeing if they could provoke'' the Sandinistas into a crackdown
that would derail peace talks, Wright said.
   ``That seems to me just intolerably two-faced,'' he said. Wright
added that he had been given ``indirect assurance'' that the
practice has now been halted.
   Wright attributed the move to investigate him to White House
pressure on Michel, but added: ``They lose on this one, because we
are on the side of democracy.''
   Regardless of the outcome, the new investigation of Wright only
added to an already long list of woes for the speaker. The ethics
panel, formally known as the Commitee on Standards of Official
Conduct, already is investigating Wright on unrelated allegations
of financial misconduct.
   A House panel on Thursday voted to give the committee an
additional $550,000 to pursue that investigation, which Dixon said
could continue into next year, depending on what is unearthed.
   ``It's taking a lot of time,'' said Rep. John T. Myers, R-Ind.,
the senior minority member of the ethics committee. ``It takes a
lot more in-depth investigation than we ever anticipated.''
   The latest controversy prompted harsh criticism of Wright by
Republican members of Congress, including a primary Senate sponsor
of legislation to tighten Congress' control over covert CIA
activities.
   The senator, William Cohen of Maine, said the speaker's comments
had apparently violated non-disclosure rules and jeopardized the
bill.
   ``The clear implication ... is that the speaker's statement
could only have been derived from classified information in the
possession of the House Intelligence Committee,'' Cohen said. ``The
speaker owes his colleagues in Congress and the American people an
explanation.''
   Cohen, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee,
said the disclosure also could doom opposition members who are
jailed for anti-government protests to longer prison terms or ``a
harsher fate,'' and would give the Sandinistas an enormous
propaganda boost.
   And Rep. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, called the action
``inexcusable.''
   ``This government simply cannot function if each individual
member (of Congress) takes it upon him or herself to decide what
can be declassified,'' she said.
   House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said the
legislation to require notice to Congress of covert actions within
48 hours, which had been due to come before the House next week,
might be put off until the following week because of the press of
other legislation.

<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev is
proposing that interim limits be placed on the most potent U.S. and
Soviet long-range nuclear weapons to keep arms control momentum
going, U.S. officials say.
   Gorbachev's proposal was sent to the State Department before
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze began talks Thursday
with Secretary of State George P. Shultz on a wide range of arms
control measures, human rights and regional problems.
   The U.S. side is willing to consider the proposal, but will
emphasize that any limitations on nuclear weapons must be
reinforced with strict verification measures to guard against
violations, the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Thursday.
   These include assurances there will be no interference with the
monitoring of test flights of the strategic nuclear missiles that
carry the warheads and have ranges of 3,500 miles and beyond.
   After a session today with Vice President George Bush and
another round with Shultz concentrating on problems in the Middle
East, southern Africa and Southeast Asia, the Soviet foreign
minister had a session scheduled at the White House with President
Reagan.
   A joint statement was to be issued then ``to mark the progress
that's been achieved,'' and Shultz and Shevardnadze were to hold
separate news conferences in the evening, a U.S. official said.
   It was not clear whether an agreement on temporary ceilings
could be reached during the two-day visit. The Soviets did not
raise the proposal in the first sessions on Thursday, the U.S.
official said.
   The United States and the Soviet Union set goals for limiting
warheads at the summit last December. Gorbachev wants to put those
limits into effect on an interim basis, separate from other arms
issues.
   These would include a ceiling of 10 warheads on U.S.
ground-launched MX missiles and eight on submarine-launched
Tridents, while the Soviets would be held to 10 warheads on their
SS-18 and SS-20 missiles, the official said.
   Shevardnadze carried a range of other arms control proposals to
Shultz along with a letter from Gorbachev to Reagan.
   ``The agenda is very broad, but we have little time,''
Shevardnadze told reporters.
   He singled out two obstacles to a Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty (START) as included in the ``full-scope negotiations'' he
was holding with Shultz. They involved restrictions to be imposed
on the range of non-ballistic cruise missiles that can be launched
by bombers and warships and ways of verifying that any agreed-upon
cutbacks on their number are not exceeded.
   Shultz met with Shevardnadze for 6{ hours and afterward
described their discussion of arms control issues and human rights
as ``very constructive and very detailed.''
   Negotiators in Geneva have been unable to resolve these
problems, as well as related questions dealing with Reagan's
Strategic Defense Initiative, the search for a space-based shield
against Soviet ballistic missiles.
   Immediately after Shultz greeted Shevardnadze, teams of U.S. and
Soviet experts began private deliberations on the twin issues of
reducing strategic nuclear weapons and on anti-missile defenses.
Veteran American and Soviet negotiators Paul H. Nitze and Viktor P.
Karpov headed their respective delegations.
   Shevardnadze also singled out hoped-for reductions in
conventional weapons in Europe as a major item on the Soviet
agenda. ``We want to see where we are, where we stand and what the
prospects are,'' he said. ``We believe there are some good
prospects.''
   Negotiations in Vienna are stalled over U.S. demands that the
Soviets give equal weight to human rights in any negotiations
between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact
to reduce troops, tanks and other conventional armaments from the
Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains in the Soviet Union.
   ``We have specific proposals in many areas,'' Shevardnadze said,
adding that the discussions in Washington would cover nuclear and
space weapons and conventional armaments and chemical weapons as
well.
   Even before Shevardnadze's arrival, some U.S. officials were
optimistic that an agreement could be reached on verifying
compliance with a 1976 treaty to limit underground nuclear tests
for so-called peaceful purposes to 150 kilotons.
   The idea is to clear the way for Reagan to submit the treaty to
the Senate for ratification before he leaves office in January.
   Wrapping up a treaty to reduce long-range nuclear missiles is a
much tougher and more important task. Reagan had hoped to complete
the accord during his second term as evidence that he is committed
to rolling back the nuclear arms race.
   On Thursday, an Armenian demonstrator managed to get
Shevardnadze's attention during a break in the foreign minister's
talks with Shultz.
   Amvarsam Khlgatian, 61, had been standing for two hours across
the street carrying a placard that read,``Gorbachev, Let Me Visit
My Dying Mother.''
   As Shevardnadze's motorcade started for the Soviet Embassy, the
man dashed into the street carrying his sign. The motorcade stopped
and security agents wrestled Khlgatian to the ground.
   Shevardnadze left his limousine to talk to the demonstrator for
a few minutes.
   ``He said, `Don't worry, I`ll take care of it,''' Khlgatian said
afterward. ``But he can do nothing. It's up to the KGB.''
   The protester said he was exiled from the Soviet Union in 1979
after serving 15 years in labor camps for attempting to escape to
the West. He said he works as a machinist in New York.
   Khlgatian gave Shevardnadze a leaflet in which he described his
mother as 80 years old and fatally ill. It said Gorbachev, despite
promises of humanization, had kept him from visiting her in
Yerevan, the Armenian capital.

   A medical student who thought his dream of
sending a science project into space exploded with the ill-fated
Challenger mission will get another chance with the launch of the
space shuttle Discovery next Thursday.
   ``It's good to continue something you believe in,'' said Richard
Cavoli, whose work was praised by President Reagan in his 1986
State of the Union Address.
   Cavoli, now a second-year medical student at the University of
Buffalo, said he feared that the Challenger disaster would put an
end to manned space exploration.
   ``I was afraid people would say it wasn't worthwhile,'' he said
Thursday at a news conference in Buffalo. ``I think it is. A lot of
problems we have on earth can be solved in space.''
   Cavoli's project involves growing crystals under zero-gravity
conditions. He theorizes that gravity creates currents in chemical
solutions that disrupt formation of crystals. He said lead-iodide
crystals formed in space might be larger and purer and lead to
improved film for X-rays and improved semiconductors in computers.
   Cavoli, 24, first thought of the experiment as a high school
student. While he attended Union College in Schenectady, school
officials sponsored the experiment, spending more than $14,000.
   Union chemistry Professor Charles Scaife helped Cavoli refine
the experiment and rebuild the equipment destroyed in the explosion.
   The project is one of only two student experiments being
conducted by Discovery astronauts. Other experiments that were part
of the Challenger mission have been cancelled by NASA.
   Cavoli was in Washington watching a broadcast of the Challenger
launch when the space shuttle blew up, killing the seven astronauts
aboard. President Reagan had planned to single him out as a ``young
American hero'' in his annual state of the Union address,
originally scheduled for that evening.
   Just after the disaster, Cavoli was in the Oval Office with the
president and three others scheduled to be saluted in the address.
   ``He was just like the rest of us, in shock,'' Cavoli said. ``He
was very somber in the beginning, but then he tried to pick things
up a bit for the sake of the rest of us.''
   Cavoli returned a week later to be recognized when the speech
was rescheduled. He sat with first lady Nancy Reagan and stood as
Congress applauded.

fighting illegal narcotics. Listed by major categories, the bill
would:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>LAW ENFORCEMENT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Give the Justice Department six months to present Congress with
a system that would allow gun dealers to identify felons attempting
to purchase handguns.
   _Revoke probation for any probationer found in possession of a
firearm.
   _Allow the death penalty for anyone who intentionally kills a
person during a drug felony. If capital punishment is not imposed,
the penalty must be a minimum of 20 years and a maximum of life
imprisonment.
   _Permit introduction of evidence, in federal criminal cases,
that was obtained in an unconstitutional search provided that
officers acted in the ``good faith belief'' they were acting
lawfully.
   _Establish civil penalties of up to $10,000 per violation for
possession of small ``personal use'' amounts of marijuana, cocaine
or any other illegal drug. The government could obtain a conviction
by proving ``clear and convincing evidence,'' far easier than the
``beyond a reasonable doubt'' standard in criminal cases. The
provision includes appeal rights.
   _Require a minimum five-year prison term for conviction for
possession of ``crack,'' a potent drug mixture with a cocaine base.
   _Impose tight controls over chemicals used to produce cocaine,
heroin and other dangerous drugs. Manufacturers, distributors,
importers and exporters would keep records on transactions and
report them to the attorney general. Imports and exports could be
suspended to prevent diversion for clandestine drug manufacturing.
   _Renew assistance to state and local governments for drug
enforcement through 1992. States would be required to pass through
federal money automatically to localities eligible for awards of
$25,000 or more. State and local contributions for matching funds
would rise from $1 for every $3 of federal money to a 50-50 split.
   _Increase money for enforcement by the Drug Enforcement
Administration, organized crime task forces, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, the FBI and the prison system.
   _Raise penalties for operating a locomotive, truck or other
common carrier under the influence of drugs or alcohol in cases
where death or serious injury results.
   _Authorize more money for the Coast Guard to increase its
personnel, and to operate, maintain and purchase anti-drug vessels,
aircraft, radar and other equipment.
   _Increase money to the Customs Service for additional personnel,
enhancement of the air interdiction program, and to buy an X-ray
imagery, vapor sensitive cargo scanning device.
   _Prohibit the distribution of anabolic steroids without a
prescription.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TREATMENT, TESTING AND REHABILITATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Establish a new block grant program for the states, designed to
reduce transmission of acquired immune deficiency syndrome by
intravenous drug abusers. States could use the money to develop and
operate treatment programs; train counselors; test individuals for
the AIDS virus; and construct or renovate facilities for treatment
of drug abusers. Money would be provided through 1991.
   _Authorize money to states for programs to prevent alcohol and
drug abuse, and treatment and rehabilitation services. Money
provided through 1991.
   _Require government regulations for certification of
laboratories performing toxicological urinalysis for drug testing
programs.
   _Require that if any money under the bill is used for AIDS
counseling and testing, the tests must be conducted confidentially,
with informed consent, and with pre- and post-test counseling.
   _Allow the secretary of the Health and Human Services Department
to make grants to expand capacity of drug treatment programs.

<HEAD>Airlines Told To Equip Aircraft With Devices To Detect Wind Shear</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Airlines have been ordered to equip their jet
fleets over the next four years with devices to help pilots escape
deadly wind shears that have been linked to five major accidents
and more than 500 deaths in the last decade.
   The Federal Aviation Administration announced the new
requirements on Thursday. They call for a phase-in of the wind
shear detection equipment on more than 3,600 jetliners by late 1992.
   Powerful shears called microbursts have been called the No. 1
killer of airline passengers and have been responsible for 18
airline accidents and 575 deaths since 1970.
   The FAA regulation was announced by the Transportation
Department and covers any commercial jetliner with 30 or more
seats. The department estimated the cost to the airlines at between
$40,000 ando $50,000 per airplane.
   A microburst is a powerful downburst of air caused by a sudden
change in wind direction that can literally drive a jetliner into
the ground if encountered during an approach or departure.
   In 1985, a microburst struck a Delta Air Lines L-1011 as it was
attempting to land at Dallas-Fort Worth, causing a crash that
killed 134 people. A Pan American World Airways jet encountered a
strong shear while trying to take off from the New Orleans airport
in 1982 and crashed, killing 154 people.
   The Delta accident focused increased attention on developing and
installing sophisticated ground radar that would provide advanced
warning of shears along departure and approach lanes, but the radar
is not expected to be available until the early 1990s and then only
at a relatively small number of airports.
   At the same time, the FAA and industry began examining training
methods to help pilots detect a shear and possibly escape, although
most pilots say there are microbursts that cannot be flown through
if encountered at a low altitude such as during a takeoff or
approach.
   The technology to help pilots escape a shear has been available
for several years. Piedmont Airlines two years ago began installing
the equipment being required by the FAA and today has the devices
in 112 of its 191 aircraft, according to Piedmont spokesman Mike
Clark.
   But some airline executives and pilots question the value of the
devices.
   The critics note that the equipment is not a radar and thus
would only help a pilot recognize when the plane already has flown
into wind shear conditions. By then it may be too late to escape if
the plane is close to the ground, they maintain.
   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley, in announcing the new
requirements, said the equipment ``will enhance safety by giving
pilots a valuable tool for coping with the dangerous wind shear
phenomenon.''
   ``Experience has shown that pilots can recover successfully from
wind shear encounters if they can recognize the situation quickly
enough and have sufficient information to execute escape
maneuvers,'' he said in a statement.
   The FAA regulation says half of an airline's fleet must have the
devices within 27 months, three-fourths of the fleet within 39
months and the rest of the fleet within 51 months.
   The rule also requires airlines to provide pilots with increased
training on wind shear recognition and recovery procedures while
using the new equipment.

<HEAD>House Set to Act on Textile Import Bill Amid New Veto Threats</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Top prospects uncertain.</NOTE>

   Tightened restrictions on textile, apparel and
shoe imports appear set for final House approval, but President
Reagan is expected to veto the measure.
   ``The textile and apparel industry probably has the least
persuasive case for further import restriction of any major
industry in this country,'' seven Cabinet officials said Thursday
night in a letter to lawmakers.
   The House was set to vote today on the measure, which would
freeze this year's imports of textiles and apparel at 1987 levels
and limit future growth to 1 percent a year. Non-rubber footwear
imports would be capped indefinitely at 1987 levels.
   The measure _ designed mainly to shield domestic producers from
foreign competition _ also would establish a pilot program under
which the government would auction import licenses.
   To build support from the farm lobby, the measure includes a
guarantee that any country increasing its purchases of U.S.
agricultural products would get a break on textile and apparel
quotas. Korea and other Asian textile-producing nations are among
the largest purchasers of American grain and other farm goods.
   The House passed a version of the bill a year ago. It was voting
today on a move to accept four Senate changes: the import license
auctions, the farm-goods provision, a change in the base year for
the freeze from 1986 to 1987 and special restrictions on shipments
of foreign-made silk neckties.
   Supporters of the textile, apparel and shoe industries say the
bill is needed to protect American jobs that otherwise will be lost
as imported textiles flood the U.S. market. They point to heavy
layoffs amid a surge in foreign-made goods that that entered the
country in the early 1980s.
   The Reagan administration counters that the textile industry is
flourishing and that the layoffs came about largely because the
manufacturers adopted automated production methods to become more
competitive in the face of stepped up competition.
   ``If this bill is passed, we and the president's other senior
advisors will recommend that he veto it,'' said a letter to
lawmakers Thursday from U.S. Trade Representative Clayton K.
Yeutter and six other Cabinet officers.
   They said the measure ``would be extremely harmful to our
country. It would hurt U.S. consumers. It would provoke retaliation
against U.S. exports, violate our international obligations and
undermine our efforts to obtain a more open trading system for U.S.
exports.''
   The veto threat was viewed as unlikely to budge supporters, and
the administration was expecting the bill on Reagan's desk within
days.
   ``He wouldn't veto it until next week,'' White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater told reporters earlier Thursday.
   Reagan vetoed a similar bill in 1985 and an override attempt
that was deferred seven months to move it closer to congressional
elections failed to gain the two-thirds support needed.
   Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., occupant of the ``textile seat'' on the
House Ways and Means Committee, said last week he hoped Reagan
would relent and sign. But if the president could not be budged, he
said, he wanted to force Reagan to use his veto pen one more time
rather than killing it through inaction with a ``pocket veto''
after Congress adjourns.
   On the eve of the House vote, Rep. Butler Derrick, D-S.C., said
there were ``a number of people who have told us they aren't going
to vote with us tomorrow but have agreed to vote for an override.''
   He said he believed that textile forces were ``about 14 short''
of the two-thirds support needed for a veto override. He said,
however, that the override attempt would not be mounted in the
House before the first week in October and thus ``we have 10 days
to work on that.''

   Actor Denzel Washington says good roles are hard
to find, despite the Oscar nomination he won for his portrayal of
martyred South African activist Stephen Biko in ``Cry Freedom.''
   ``It's not a coincidence that the last three pictures I've made,
I've had to go out of the country to do,'' he said.
   ``Cry Freedom'' was filmed in Zimbabwe. ``For Queen and
Country,'' made in London, and ``Finding Maubee,'' made in Jamaica,
will be released early next year.
   Washington's dream is to play the leading man in a romantic
comedy, something like Jimmy Stewart's role in ``Mr. Smith Goes to
Washington.''
   ``Stewart was so wholesome and honest,'' he told Gentleman's
Quarterly in an interview published in its October issue. ``A
regular guy who overcomes. But I don't know if you can get away
with that anymore. It's hard to believe in the American Dream that
he was always fighting for.''
   For six years, Washington, 33, played the Yale-educated Dr.
Phillip Chandler on the television hospital series ``St.
Elsewhere.''

   A burglar picked the wrong victim in Mike
Synar when he allegedly stole a pair of gold cuff links from the
Oklahoma congressman's Washington home.
   Synar chased and tackled the man Thursday with assistance from a
passerby.
   The 37-year-old Democrat said he returned home shortly after
dawn from jogging to find a burglar in his house.
   ``I was standing outside my house screaming, `Call 911, call
911!' I looked like Richard Dreyfuss in the movie `Down and Out in
Beverly Hills,''' Synar told The Tulsa Tribune's Washington bureau.
   Synar said when he saw the man open a second-story bedroom
window and hop out, he shouted for help to a young man on the
street.
   ``We followed him through yards and alleys,'' and grabbed the
man about three blocks away, Synar said. ``I knocked him down. I
had his hands pinned and then the cops came and we got him.''
   Police arrested the man, who refused to give his name.
   ``The thing I keep thinking now,'' Synar said, ``what would I
have done if he had had a gun?''

   The show went on in the best Broadway tradition as
assistant choreographer Toni Kaye replaced Ann Miller in the
starring role in the just-opened musical ``Sugar Babies.''
   ``This lady to my left is what show business is all about,''
co-star Micky Rooney told the Savoy Theater audience Thursday
during the curtain calls for the third night of the musical, which
toured the United States for eight years.
   Miss Miller, suffering from a swollen ankle, performed the
Thursday matinee, but decided about 90 minutes before the curtain
went up not to do the evening performance, said company manager
Jane Tamlyn.
   She said Miss Kaye had performed the role in America and
Australia and was Miss Miller's size, so could be called upon on
short notice.
   Miss Kaye was to fly back to America on Saturday, and if Miss
Miller is not back in the show by then, her part will be played by
her understudy, Rhonda Burchmore.

   The House adopted legislation that could make
Americans pay dearly for possessing a single marijuana cigarette or
a small bag of cocaine, and the Senate must decide whether to
follow suit.
   The drug-fighting bill passed the House on a bipartisan 375-30
vote Thursday, after minority Republicans molded the legislation to
target drug users for special punishment.
   Those who consider themselves recreational users could, under
the bill: lose student loans, public housing and other federal
benefits; face civil penalties of up to $10,000 for each drug
possession violation; and have their drivers' licenses suspended if
their states participate in a proposed drug enforcement grant
program.
   ``Up to now, the war on drugs meant a war on the drug pushers,
the drug kingpins,'' said Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., author of
the $10,000 civil penalty. ``What we did ... was to declare a war
on the use of drugs in America.''
   The Senate, eager to quit to campaign for re-election, is still
trying to write a bill for introduction, and will have to race the
adjournment clock to pass legislation in time to work out any
differences with the House.
   The Senate's wide-open debate, usually without time limits,
could work against completion of the bill this year. Only the pull
of an upcoming election might cause senators to break into a trot
on the bill.
   The legislation pursues many avenues of combatting illegal
drugs, and would authorize the addition of more than $2 billion in
spending to the nation's current $3.9 billion anti-drug effort. If
all the money is actually appropriated, the amount could be a
factor if overall spending levels force across-the-board, automatic
budget cuts.
   The House's most liberal members refused to support that
chamber's bill after it emerged laden down with harsh GOP-inspired
penalties. One of their number, Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., said
``Americans will be less free'' under the legislation, which he
called ``a shameful, excessive, election-year disgrace.''
   The bill introduced in the House two weeks ago included
increased money for state and local law enforcement, requirements
for drug-free workplaces by government contractors, and grants for
education, treatment and rehabilitation, among other provisions.
   It emerged with the severe penalties for drug users, along with
constitutional procedures to permit the federal death penalty
against anyone who kills during a drug-related crime.
   The drug bill's hardliners suffered their only defeat Thursday
when the House refused to support withholding of highway money from
states that refused to suspend drivers' licenses of convicted drug
offenders.
   But they still won half a loaf, when lawmakers adopted a
substitute that turned the penalty into an incentive program.
Lawmakers voted 281-119 to authorize $125 million over three years
to states willing to enact laws suspending or revoking drivers'
licenses for those convicted of any drug offense.
   The bill received support from 207 Democrats and 168
Republicans, while all 30 votes against the legislation came from
Democrats. But supporters of the overall bill had problems too.
   ``We took a lot of provisions of dubious constitutionality,''
said Rep. William J. Hughes, chairman of the House Judiciary
subcommittee on crime. Hughes, who voted for the legislation, said
he hoped lawmakers could ``clean up'' some of the language in a
House-Senate conference.
   President Reagan, asked upon arrival in Houston whether he was
pleased by the passage of the bill, smiled and said, ``Yes.''
   Rep. Don Edwards said Americans' freedoms would be injured by:
   _Language allowing admission of illegally seized evidence in
federal cases if officers acted in the ``good faith belief'' they
were behaving lawfully.
   _The death penalty provision because, ``If current practice in
the states is any guide, that power will be exercised in a racially
discriminatory manner.'' The language also includes a minimum
20-year sentence for killings in drug-related crimes.
   _The denial of federal assistance to ``the poor and the
addicted'' by making them ineligible for student loans, public
housing and other benefits for two drug convictions. Veterans'
benefits could be denied for one drug distribution conviction that
resulted in a one-year prison term. Retirement, welfare, health and
disability assistance of all types would be exempted.
   _The civil penalties of $10,000 per violation for any possession
of illegal drugs, which would require ``clear and convincing''
proof rather than the stricter ``beyond a reasonable doubt''
standard in criminal cases. The provision lacks ``the procedural
protections guaranteed by the Bill of Rights,'' Edwards said.

<HEAD>U.S. Ends Non-Humanitarian Aid To Troubled Burma</HEAD>

   The United States has ended all aid to Burma
except emergency humanitarian assistance, citing political unrest
in the Southeast Asian nation.
   Burma has been rocked in recent months by widespread
pro-democracy protests that have been suppressed ruthlessly this
week by leaders of a military coup last weekend.
   ``In light of the current unsettled political conditions in
Burma, we are unable to continue our assistance programs there for
the time being,'' State Department spokesman Rudi Boone said
Thursday.
   ``Accordingly, we are halting further aid other than emergency
humanitarian assistance until conditions permit a resumption,'' he
said, reading from a State Department statement. ``We hope that
that will be soon and we look forward to renewing cooperation with
Burma and the Burmese people.''
   Boone said he believed U.S. aid to Burma totaled $12.3 million,
but he did not know how much of the aid is for emergency
humanitarian assistance.
   ``Whatever emergency humanitarian assistance there is, there's
precious little of it,'' said Robert Hathaway, spokesman for Rep.
Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs.
   He pegged the total aid to Burma at $14 million.
   ``They were authorized almost $7 million in anti-narcotics aid
and $7 million in developmental assistance,'' he said, noting that
since the fiscal year ends Sept. 30, ``I'm not sure how much of
(that money) has not yet been expended.''
   Hathaway said Solarz, who recently visited Burma en route home
from Moscow and Beijing, would support the cutoff of aid ``as a
symbol of our commitment to the democratic cause and a symbol of
our uneasiness, or worse _ uneasiness really isn't a strong enough
word _ of the course of events of the last few days, in particular
the bloodshed and deaths.''
   Months of pro-democracy demonstrations led to the resignation in
late July of Ne Win, who seized power in 1962 and whose
authoritarian rule turned resource-rich Burma into a land of
poverty.
   Gen. Saw Maung, who became prime minister Wednesday after
leading a military coup Sunday, is the third new leader in two
months of chaos and bloodshed.
   Sein Lwin succeeded Ne Win but lasted for only 17 days of
massive protests before Maung Maung took over. He was a civilian
but was viewed as close to the military.
   Saw Maung, who is closely associated with Ne Win, has pledged to
hold elections as soon as peace is restored.
   Since the coup, the government has acknowledged security forces
killed at least 146 people, but a Western diplomat has said at
least 400 have been slain, including many unarmed pro-democracy
demonstrators.
   Opposition leaders sent Saw Maung a letter Thursday urging the
government ``not to arrest people including the monks, students,
artists, etc., in connection with the recent unrest and also to
release those already under detention.''
   Solarz introduced a resolution _ unanimously approved by the
House on Sept. 7 _ urging democratic change in Burma.
   The resolution called for ``the establishment of a transitional
body, consisting of Burmese citizens who are unquestionably
committed to democracy and who have the confidence of the Burmese
people, to organize the holding of multiparty elections and
otherwise facilitate the establishment of a genuinely democratic
government.''

<HEAD>Hundreds Of Thousands of Americans Still Risk AIDS, Survey Shows</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Most Americans are ``at relatively low risk'' of
AIDS from sexual contact, but the hundreds of thousands who still
have sex with multiple partners are at ``considerable risk,''
according to a new nationwide survey.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that
a survey shows that more than 80 percent of respondents have had
either one or no sex partners in the previous year.
   Nevertheless, ``a sizeable percentage of young, never-married
men report more than 10 partners in the past 12 months,'' including
5 percent of those age 18-29.
   The survey interviewed 1,481 people in a scientific sample,
asking them to submit written, anonymous answers to four questions
about their sexual habits.
   Three percent of the 638 men interviewed, both single and
married, reported five to 10 sex partners in the previous year. One
in 100 reported more than 10 _ including 3 percent of the men
between 18 and 29, 1 percent of the men 30-44 and 2 percent of the
men 45-60.
   ``This is something that concerns us,'' said Dr. William Darrow,
a CDC AIDS specialist. ``You're talking about millions of people
... and we don't know whether they're taking other kinds of
precautions,'' such as discussing AIDS testing with partners and
using condoms.
   Applied to the U.S. population, the survey indicates more than
700,000 single men aged 18-29 and more than 100,000 aged 30-44 may
have 10 or more partners a year, thus leaving themselves ``at
considerable risk'' of AIDS, the CDC said.
   Among the 843 women surveyed, 0.7 percent said they had five or
more partners in the past year. That included 1 percent of those
aged 18-29, 0.4 percent of those aged 30-44 and 0.7 percent of
those 45-60.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is spread chiefly through
sexual contact or the sharing of drug needles; persons with
multiple sex partners are considered at increased risk for the
deadly disease. More than 70,000 U.S. cases have been reported, and
federal health officials believe as many as 1.5 million Americans
are infected with the virus that can cause AIDS.
   Overall, 22 percent of the respondents said they had had no sex
partners in the previous year, and 60 percent reported only one
partner. Eleven percent said two to four, 2 percent said five or
more, and 6 percent did not answer the question.
   ``Most Americans appear to be at relatively low risk of
infection'' from the virus that causes AIDS, the CDC said. Darrow
said that particularly includes the 80 percent who reported one sex
partner or none in the last year.
   People also were asked about the status of their sex partners _
their gender and whether they were spouses, friends, pick-ups or
prostitutes.
   Six percent of the men and 1 percent of the women surveyed said
at least one of their sex partners in the previous year was a
``casual date or pick-up.'' Well below 1 percent reported paying
for sex.
   Of the men reporting sex in the previous year, 3 percent said
their partners included males and another 6 percent didn't answer
the question. Homosexual men make up the largest group of AIDS
patients in the United States.
   CDC researchers ``really didn't know what to expect'' from the
survey, Darrow said, noting there have been no definitive
scientific sexual behavior studies in recent years. The
ground-breaking Kinsey report on sexual behavior is now 40 years
old and was too unscientifically based.
   The survey reported Thursday included adults living in
households; prisoners and transients were not included, ``and they
may be at greater risk,'' Darrow said.
   The survey was conducted by the National Opinion Research
Center, a private center which has conducted surveys on social
issues since 1972. The center receives funding from the National
Science Foundation, and shared its research with federal health
officials, Darrow said.
   The survey was conducted between Feb. 14 and April 25. The
margin of error varies from finding to finding, depending on a
number of variables, but is believed to be less than 4 percent
overall, NORC researchers said.

   Continental Airlines has been awarded the
highly contested and lucrative air route between Seattle and Tokyo
after two years of controversy, a court challenge and questions
about possible conflict of interest.
   United Airlines, which currently flies the route, said it would
ask the Transportation Department to reconsider its decision, which
came Thursday. American Airlines also had been in the running to
win the route on a permanent basis.
   The decision by the Transporation Department came after the
Justice Department refused to challenge a federal court decision
which in August ordered the route given to Continental, according
to a high-ranking Transportation Department official.
   The official, who asked not to be identified, said
Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley had argued strongly to appeal
the case, but that Justice spurned the idea.
   ``He (Burnley) believes we could have had the (court) opinion
reversed on appeal,'' the official said.
   The department made no formal announcement of its order.
   Opponents of the ruling have 10 days to petition the department
to reconsider its decision, said DOT spokesman Bob Marks. He said
the provision for a reconsideration request is standard in such
cases.
   In Chicago, United issued a statement saying it was encouraged
that the ruling allowed for a reconsideration request, adding that
the company ``strongly believes that the merits of the case clearly
support United's retention of the route.''
   A department administrative law judge had recommended
Continental for the route originally, but a succession of senior
department officials disagreed, chosing at one point United and
then American.
   Before a final decision could be made, a federal appeals court
ruled in late August that the original administrative law judge's
recommendation should stand. Continental had filed suit because it
had not been given the route.
   The Seattle-Tokyo route previously had been flown by Pan
American World Airways, but United assumed the route temporarily
when it purchased Pan Am's Pacific Division in 1986.
   The Transportation Department approved United's acquisition of
the Pan Am routes only under the condition that the Seattle-Tokyo
route be dealt with separately.
   Last year a DOT administrative law judge recommended that the
route be given to Continental, but that recommendation was subject
to review by a senior department official designated to deal with
international air routes.
   The official, Vance Fort, then deputy assistant secretary for
policy and international affairs, disagreed and recommended United.
   Later, however, a conflict of interst problem arose because Fort
at the time had been negotiating for employment at Flying Tiger
Airlines, which stood to benefit depending on which airline got the
Seattle-Tokyo route.
   Although no action was taken against Fort, the case was returned
to another administrative law judge, who also recommended that
United keep the route. But that decision was overruled by Fort's
successor, who recommended American.
   The department was about to make a final decision, presumably
American, when the federal court ruling on Continental's suit
intervened.

<HEAD>House Defeats Mandatory AIDS Testing for Prisoners, Marriage
Applicants</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Top prospects uncertain</NOTE>

   A bill to expand voluntary AIDS testing among
high-risk individuals neared House passage with wide bipartisan
majorities turning back proposals to force tests on prisoners,
hospital patients and marriage license applicants.
   Lawmakers also defeated by a large margin a proposal requiring
states to collect identifying information on people who test
positive for the AIDS virus.
   Opponents successfully argued that anonymous testing is a much
better way to attract people at highest risk of being infected with
AIDS and that testing resources need to be concentrated on those
people rather than populations that probably haven't been exposed.
   ``Let's not take limited resources ... and waste them,'' said
Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chief sponsor of the testing measure.
``Let the states do their own efforts as they see fit.''
   The Waxman bill would give states complying with its terms an
extra $400 million a year to conduct widespread, voluntary AIDS
testing and counseling.
   It also would protect the confidentiality of counseling and
testing records, speed up research into acquired immune deficiency
syndrome and create a national commission to advise Congress on
issues raised by the fatal disease.
   Final House action could come as early as today. The bill then
goes to the Senate.
   The Human Rights Campaign Fund, a political action committee for
the gay and lesbian community, praised the House for rejecting what
it called hostile amendments proposed by Rep. William Dannemeyer,
R-Calif., and other conservatives.
   ``Members of the House have sent a clear signal to Rep.
Dannemeyer and others who support irrational, punitive AIDS actions
that the time has come for responsible AIDS policy,'' the fund's
executive director, Vic Basile, said in a statement.
   The virus that causes AIDS, a fatal disease, most often is
spread through close contact with contaminated blood products or
semen. Its principal victims have been homosexuals and intravenous
drug users.
   The House agreed to require testing of prisoners convicted of
prostitution or crimes related to sexual assault or IV drug abuse.
The plan was approved 266-137 as an alternative to mandatory
testing of all prisoners.
   Amendments defeated Thursday included:
   _A proposal to require testing of all marriage license
applicants in states where the incidence of AIDS infection is over
one in 1,000, sponsored by Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla. It lost
304-91.
   Rep. Edward Madigan, R-Ill., said his state's program has
identified nine applicants infected with AIDS out of 75,000 people
tested, at a cost to newlyweds of $400,000 for each identified
case. He said the governor has requested it be repealed.
   Rep. Lindy Boggs, D-La., said her state repealed its requirement
after a year because it was an economic hardship, produced a
significant number of false positive tests and did nothing for
those groups at highest risk. ``Let's not force our mistake on the
rest of the nation,'' she said.
   _A proposal to require hospitals in high-incidence states to
test virtually all inpatients between ages 15 and 50, sponsored by
Dannemeyer. It lost 302-89. Health workers are expected to treat
all patients as infected and protect themselves accordingly,
Madigan said.
   _A proposal to require reporting of AIDS-infected individuals
with enough information to locate them, another Dannemeyer
initiative. It lost 327-70.
   Proponents accused Congress of ignoring the need for information
on the epidemic. But opponents said demographic data on
AIDS-infected people must be reported under the bill and
identifying information would drive people underground.
   The lawmakers cited the case of Oregon, where a switch to
anonymous testing resulted in a 125 percent increase in the number
of homosexual men being tested and a 56 percent increase in the
number of prostitutes tested. They also noted that in South
Carolina, a switch to name reporting resulted in a 51 percent drop
in the number of homosexual men being tested at a Charleston site.

<HEAD>NRC Raises Possibility That Seabrook May Never Operate
Commercially</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A ruling by the Nuclear Regulation Commission
raises the possibility that the idled Seabrook, N.H., reactor may
never be allowed to operate commercially.
   The commission said Thursday that before receiving a low-power
license, the financially troubled Seabrook owners must prove they
can pay for decommissioning the reactor in the event they
eventually fail to gain a full-power license.
   In a unanimous vote without debate, the commissioners ordered
Seabrook to submit a plan within 30 days that provides ``reasonable
assurance that adequate funds will be available so that safe
decommissioning will be reasonably assured.''
   Seabrook officials expressed optimism that they would be able to
satisfy the commissioners.
   ``We're in the process of answering those questions right now
and we're confident this won't be an issue barring us from
low-power testing,'' said Ronald A. Sher, spokesman for New
Hampshire Yankee, the plant's operator.
   Some opponents said they, too, expected the NRC to approve the
company's decommissioning plan.
   ``It's not very hard to satisfy the NRC if you're a nuclear
utility,'' said Robert Backus, a New Hampshire attorney for the
Seacoast Anti-Pollution League.
   But others said they were cautiously optimistic about the agency
they regularly criticize for being too soft on the nuclear industry.
   Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon, who opposes an
operating license for Seabrook, said the ruling ``was frankly
unexpected by us and makes us feel that as this goes along they're
going to pay closer attention to the finacial stability.''
   A ruling on the decommissioning question could not come until
mid-November at the earliest.
   Seabrook officials said they have no estimate on decommissioning
costs but said low-power testing would add about $4 million to the
cost. Opponents disputed that figure, saying it was much too low.
   The commission also has to resolve the separate question of
whether Seabrook's owners are financially fit to operate the plant.
Martin Malsch, the NRC deputy general counsel, said the agency
hopes to settle that matter within a month.
   The two financial qualification issues represent the only
regulatory obstacles remaining in Seabrook's prolonged quest for a
license that would allow the owners to test the reactor at 5
percent of power. Low-power testing is a necessary step to
obtaining a commercial license to operate the plant at full power.
   The license is also pivotal for Seabrook opponents. They say the
5 percent testing would contaminate the reactor with radioactive
fuel, making it much more difficult to convert the plant to a
gas-fired facility or to decommission it.

<TEXT>
   To hear Michael Dukakis' aides describe it,
George Bush is a world-class debater who gobbled up his Republican
opponents every time he sat down with them during the 1988 primary
campaign.
   But the Bush campaign begs to differ. ``Facts are facts.
Dukakis' strongest suit is debate format,'' says the vice
president's campaign manager, Lee Atwater, recalling the Democrat's
experience as host of a television discussion program in the 1970s.
   This is not a sudden outbreak of pleasantries on the rough and
tumble campaign trail to the White House. Instead, it's part of a
grand strategy leading to Sunday's kickoff debate of the fall
campaign, with each side trying to inflate the other candidate to
the status of political giant so their own man can come out looking
like a giant killer.
   That's not the end of it, either, as Bush and Dukakis point
toward Sunday's 90-minute set-to in Winston-Salem, N.C., the first
of two presidential debates this fall.
   Both men must ``try to win not so much the debate itself as the
news coverage of the debate'' afterward, says Larry McCarthy, a
Republican political consultant not involved with Bush's campaign.
   That means carefully scripted, highly quotable utterances that
make the candidate look strong and convey his message and will be
rebroadcast time after time after time in the network news coverage
that follows the debate.
   And it means a smile isn't just a smile.
   ``Even the reactions will probably be staged'' while the other
candidate is talking, in case the gestures are being recorded by
another camera, he said.
   The psychological warfare isn't confined to manipulating the
public expectations of the two men.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if they have a big batch of Bush
supporters outside the hall so all he (Dukakis) sees when he enters
the hall are Bush signs,'' McCarthy said.
   Many Republicans and Democrats say Dukakis probably has more to
gain in the debate and Bush has more to lose. That's because the
vice president has held the momentum in recent weeks and the trends
in the polls have been his way.
   Dukakis' advisers say the most important thing for him is to
appear presidential _ an elusive, ill-defined quality _ if he is to
succeed, while Republicans say Bush must avoid a major gaffe that
would reverse the gains he has made in recent weeks.
   ``The public has got to look at this man and think he's
presidential,'' says Francis O'Brien, a Dukakis adviser. ``It's a
cumulative thing. You sit there and you look at what he says and
how he looks. If you can cross that threshhold, that's an enormous
leg up for a candidate for president.''
   Watch Dukakis' behavior, says Republican consultant Eddie Mahe.
If he is constantly on the attack, it is a sign that he, too,
believes the Republicans are headed for victory unless he can
succeed in rattling Bush. If he is less aggressive, it probably
means he believes the race has settled back down and he has time to
make his points, Mahe added.
   Mahe, who is not involved in preparing the vice president for
the debate, says ``all George Bush has to do is as he did in
earlier debates and be a natural and reassured and deliberate
individual.''
   He recommends Bush begin his answers with a positive statement
about his own views and then wind up with a critical comment about
Dukakis.
   Bush successfully deflected potentially embarrassing questions
dealing with the Iran-Contra affair and taxes during the primary
debates, and Mahe says he can and should be able to anticipate
anything Dukakis throws at him.
   ``You have to avoid being strident. I would try to have thought
through every possible line of attack, and they are calculable _
Noriega, offshore oil drilling.''
   Leslie Dach, Dukakis' communications adviser, says this isn't a
make or break event. ``It isn't like 1984 when if the Democratic
candidate didn't knock the other guy's lights out he was history,''
he said.
   ``Michael Dukakis will be tough and he'll be engaged but we
don't have a haymaker strategy.''
   Atwater agrees that the debate isn't ``the end of the world one
way or another.'' He adds, ``As long as the candidates are
discussing the issues, it's to George Bush's favor.''
   Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster, says that for Bush, ``the big
thing is to be able to be consistent and to be able to say
something that goes beyond being peripheral and negative'' and
establish himself as an independent political force apart from
President Reagan.
   McCarthy, who worked for Sen. Bob Dole during the Republican
primaries, said Bush needs to ``come off as having more of a
positive message than we've seen from him recently.''
   Dukakis ``has to be relaxed and warm and have a couple of good
funny lines'' at Bush's expense, he said.

   The government is back in the business of
selling thousands of single-family houses to the highest bidder,
but human rights groups are demanding that they be used to shelter
the nation's homeless.
   Department of Housing and Urban Development officials said
Thursday they expect sale contracts to be signed for 2,500 houses
within the next few days, and most such sales are to families with
low-to-moderate incomes.
   About 27,000 HUD-owned houses across the country went back on
the market Thursday morning, following U. S. District Judge Oliver
Gasch's refusal to extend a ban on their sale. Contracts on the
2,500 were almost ready to be signed when Gasch issued a temporary
restraining order three weeks ago.
   HUD houses average $45,000 and are being sold in nearly every
state, although very few are available in the Northeast or in areas
where houses sell for more than $100,000, said Jim Nistler, HUD
deputy assistant secretary.
   ``We are deeply disappointed,'' said Florence Roisman, counsel
for the National Housing Law Project, which has sued to stop sale
of the 7,000 houses monthly that HUD acquires through default of
Federal Housing Administration-backed loans.
   ``We consider that when the government owns empty homes and
millions of children are growing up in ugly, hurtful, deprived
environments, both law and common decency require that the
government should use those homes to house those families,'' Ms.
Roisman said.
   A National Academy of Sciences report released Monday estimated
there are more than 100,000 children among 735,000 homeless on any
given night. HUD puts the total number of homeless people at
450,000, while advocacy groups say there are as many as 3 million.
   Government lawyers argued that stopping the HUD home sales would
bankrupt the FHA's home mortgage insurance fund which receives its
financing from the sales and from the 3.8 percent fee buyers pay
for FHA-backed mortgages.
   HUD general counsel J. Michael Dorsey said the insurance fund
would be bankrupt by 1990 if the sales were stopped. HUD says it
has received $2.4 billion from the house sales since the beginning
of the fiscal year, last Oct. 1.
   Dorsey estimated that the three-week ban on sales imposed by the
court order cost HUD $500,000 in maintenance fees and other
expenses for the unsold houses.
   Dorsey said 70 percent of the HUD houses are purchased by people
who are going to live in them, and most of those were families with
low-to-moderate incomes.
   The remainder are sold to investors, he said, most of whom say
they will either sell or rent the home within a year.
   Houses are sold, usually through real estate agents, by sealed
bids which are opened 10 days after a house is advertised.
   Jim Stimpson, HUD expert on homeless policy, said about 400 of
the HUD-owned houses have been sold at a discount to agencies
providing living space for the homeless.
   HUD has a program that allows the houses to be sold for use by
the homeless at as low as 60 percent of value, depending on how
long they are on the market, Stimpson said.
   But homeless advocates say the federal government has not done
enough to turn over space it owns to people who have been living in
the streets or temporary shelters.
   ``I don't think HUD is supposed to be in the real estate
business,'' said Maria Foscarinis, counsel for the National
Coalition for the Homeless, which has a separate suit trying to
force the agency to inventory all government buildings that might
be used by the homeless.
   She said the coalition does not expect the government to simply
turn over all the houses and empty government buildings, but ``a
lot of local, non-government, non-profit agencies are desperate for
buildings in which to operate programs for the homeless.''
   ``It's clear,'' she said, ``that the federal government would
rather sell its property in order to generate money.''

   As many as two-thirds of the nation's children
are free from tooth decay, but other dental health problems remain
unsolved, federal health researchers said Thursday.
   Preliminary results from a 1986-87 survey of U.S. schoolchildren
show more than 65 percent of the nation's 9-year-old children free
of tooth decay, the national Centers for Disease Control reported.
In a 1979-80 survey the figure was 49 percent.
   ``The downward trend in dental caries (tooth decay) in U.S.
schoolchildren has been occurring over the past two decades. The
decline has occurred in all age groups and all regions of the
country,'' the CDC said in its weekly report.
   But, the CDC said, tooth decay remains a persistent problem for
some high-risk groups, including poor children and minority
children.
   And while federal health officials' goal of no tooth decay in 40
percent of the nation's 9-year-old children has been surpassed,
three of 11 other dental-health goals for 1990 are unlikely to be
reached, the CDC said. One other objective has been reached,
progress is being made toward four, and information is not
sufficient to assess the other three, the Atlanta-based agency said.
   ``We have indications that the dental health of children has
improved, and we're very encouraged by that,'' said Dr. Susan
Szpunar, a CDC dental health specialist. ``But it's something we
have to look at with cautious optimism; there are still a lot of
dental health problems in the population which need to be taken
care of.''
   The trend in dental health in the United States, which the CDC
termed ``positive and encouraging,'' could be an omen to a new
problem, she said.
   ``The problem right now is people saying that if their kids
aren't getting cavities, they don't have to go to the dentist,''
she said. ``Another problem is communities that fluoridate (water
supplies) saying `Should we keep fluoridating?'
   ``That's a real dangerous question. The reason for the
improvement is the kids are getting it (fluoride). If it stops,
we'll probably see a reverse.''
   In addition to reducing tooth decay in children, the nation has,
according to the CDC, achieved one other dental health goal for
1990: making three-quarters of U.S. adults aware of the need for
good personal oral hygiene and regular professional care to control
periodontal disease.
   Three of the 12 goals are not likely to be met by 1990, the CDC
said: having no schools or health-care facilities offering
cavity-causing foods; having all school athletes wear recommended
mouth guards; and having 95 percent of the people with community
water getting fluoridation.
   The CDC noted that removing sugar from schools would mean an end
to band candy sales _ ``and that's difficult to tell people to
do,'' Ms. Szpunar said. Only three college sports require mouth
guards _ football, hockey and men's lacrosse _ and only 62 percent
of the population on community water get fluoride.
   Progress has been made toward four other goals, the CDC said:
reducing gingivitis _ gum inflammation _ and destructive
periodontal disease in adults to around 20 percent; making 95
percent of schoolchildren and parents aware of the risk factors for
dental disease and the benefits of fluoride; having a system in
place to monitor U.S. dental health; and having systems in place to
monitor public-health preventive measures.
   The CDC said insufficient information is available to assess
progress in three other areas: gingivitis in children, getting
fluoride to children who aren't on community water systems and
improving children's personal dental hygiene.

<HEAD>US Denies It Blocked Visas For Nicaraguans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department has denied charges it
blocked visas for Nicaraguan officials planning to attend next
week's opening of the U.N. General Assembly, but Nicaraguan
President Danield Ortega has cancelled his trip.
   ``We have not denied the Nicaraguans visas,'' department
spokesman Charles Redman said Thursday. ``We're processing their
visas. The Nicaraguans applied late.''
   Redman said U.S. officials normally require 15 working days for
processing Nicaraguan visa applications but that the Sandinista
officials made the request on Sept. 13 for a Sept. 24 arrival in
New York. The assembly gets under way on Sept. 26.
   Of 60 visas requested, 30 have been expedited, including those
of Ortega and his family and senior foreign ministry officials,
Redman said.
   Other officials said the State Department is planning to approve
the remaining visa requests on Oct. 4, 15 working days after the
applications were submitted. By that date, Ortega had planned to be
back in Nicaragua.
   ``This arbitrary and illegal attitude constitutes a denial of
Nicaraguan rights,'' Nicaraguan Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Hugo
Tinoco said in Managua as he announced that Ortega was canceling
his trip that was to have included a speech to the General Assembly.
   Rudi Boone, a State Department spokesman, said late Thursday he
had no comment on Ortega's decision.
   Asked whether the department could expedite the visas in time
for Ortega and his entourage to attend the General Assembly, Boone
said, ``I could not say.''
   Nicaragua's ambassador to the United Nations, Alejandro Serrano
Caldera, accused the State Department Wednesday night of blocking
the visa requests.
   On Thursday, Leonor Huper, acting head of the Nicaraguan Embassy
in Washington, reiterated the charge and she denied Redman's
assertion that Ortega's family members had received visas.
   She also disputed Redman's statement that the visa applications
were not filed in time.
   ``We requested the visas with enough time,'' she said.
   Marcos Wheelock, minister counselor of Nicaragua's Organization
of American States delegation, said Ortega had planned to fly from
New York to Washington on Sept. 29 to address the OAS permanent
council.
   Wheelock said OAS rules require that the United States, as host
country, permit each member state to staff its delegation as it
sees fit.
   Thus, the U.S. decision to delay approval of some visa requests
until after Ortega's scheduled OAS speech ``interferes severely''
with Nicaragua's rights as an OAS member, Wheelock said. He added
that Nicaragua has lodged a protest with OAS Secretary General Joao
Baena Soares.

<HEAD>America's Dairy Cows Just Keep on Giving</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dairy cow is as American as, well, ice
cream and apple pie. She goes back to Jamestown, Va., in 1611, and
that was 13 years before the Pilgrims had cows to milk up in
Plymouth Colony.
   Farmers are milking fewer cows today than they did a few years
ago, but each cow is producing lots more milk. And there are all
sorts of different products these days, from commercially prepared
eggnog to fruit-flavored yogurt.
   In fact, according to the Milk Industry Foundation the average
cow of 150 years ago produced an estimated 1,500 quarts of milk per
year. Today's Bossy yields 6,412 quarts annually.
   A 42-page booklet, the 1988 edition of Milk Facts, just
published by the foundation is a pocket-size encyclopedia about the
dairy business.
   For example:
   _The fluid milk industry employed 71,000 people in 1986, down 3
percent from 1985, but it had a 1 percent larger annual payroll of
$1.6 billion.
   _In 1987, retail sales of fluid milk (the drinking kind) rose 5
percent to $25 billion. Gains continued to be reported for low-fat
and skim milk, while sales of plain whole milk declined.
   Low-fat sales averaged 41.5 quarts per capita; skim milk, 6.5
quarts; and plain whole milk, 48.3 quarts.
   _Yogurt sales climbed 7 percent last year, with sales averaging
4.6 pounds per person.
   _Sales of some other manufactured products also showed
increases, including American cheese and ``other'' varieties, while
butter sales declined fractionally.
   The booklet also includes basic definitions and information that
may appeal to consumers needing to know more about milk and its
products.
   ``Although milk from the cow is processed, it is not an

   The Agriculture Department's $3.9 billion
emergency program to help farmers recover from this year's
devastating drought is set to begin operating on Oct. 3.
   President Reagan signed the Disaster Assistance Act on Aug. 11,
and the Agriculture Department has been working since then to put
the necessary regulations into effect and get county offices ready
to accept applications.
   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said Thursday that crop
and livestock producers should organize their production
information and evidence in advance to help speed up payments for
qualified drought losses.
   The program will be handled by county offices of the
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service.
   An agency spokesman, Ray Waggoner, said the counties will decide
on how to schedule payments to qualified applicants.
   ``In some cases, they (farmers) can get a check the same day
they apply, depending on how busy the offices are,'' Waggoner said.
``But it will depend on the local situation.''
   Waggoner said the first round of assistance will go to crop
producers, followed by other programs for those who suffered losses
to livestock, forage and tree operations.

   Green bows will sprout from the lapels
of businessmen, schoolchildren and tourists next week as Florida's
Space Coast pins its hopes for continued economic boom times on the
launch of Discovery.
   ``Every day, there is a little more excitement and a little bit
more tension. You can feel it,'' said Dr. Bruce Rafert, acting
executive director of the Space Research Institute at Florida
Institute of Technology. ``Space is our business and people here
understand the extreme significance of what success and failure
means.''
   The Challenger explosion 32 months ago was a blow to the Space
Coast, where launching rockets has been both a business and a
personal adventure for almost three decades. It meant the loss of
thousands of jobs for engineers, technicians and others at
aerospace companies and with the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   To the surprise of many, however, the local economy weathered
the disaster quite well.
   ``We've done a lot better than people thought we would do,''
says Joe Catrambone, executive director of the Titusville Chamber
of Commerce. ``On an overall basis, the business climate was up
over the past two years. Maybe not as much as we would have wanted,
but it was still growth.''
   His words are echoed by economic specialists in other parts of
Brevard County.
   ``There were cuts in space center jobs at first, and overtime
was curtailed significantly, but it didn't take too long before
they (NASA and shuttle contractors) were back up to normal,'' said
Hank Taylor, assistant director of the Brevard Economic Development
Council, based in Cocoa. ``The numbers (of workers) are greater
today than at the time of the accident.''
   Tourism, too, has increased at a steady pace. And commercial
activity _ retail stores, hotels, restaurants _ has been healthy
for much of the past two years after suffering a sharp dip in the
first months following Challenger.
   The Spaceport USA visitors center has recorded record attendance
in each of the past 20 months and is now Florida's fourth
most-popular tourist attraction, following Disney World, Sea World
and Busch Gardens. Attendance for 1988 is expected to reach 2.7
million visitors.
   Enthusiasm for the launch, scheduled for Thursday, has been
heightened by a ``green-for-shuttle'' campaign spearheaded by
Brevard County's three chambers of commerce in Titusville, Cocoa
Beach and Melbourne.
   Spokesmen for those groups say they expect more than half a
million visitors for launch, about half of those in Titusville,
which is directly across the Indian River from the launch pad.
   The chamber campaigns include the sale of thousands of green
lapel bows that residents and visitors will begin wearing five days
before launch. Businessmen have ordered them by the hundreds, at 40
cents apiece, and the county school board has purchased 56,000 of
them for grade schoolchildren.
   ``The green bows are symbols that visibly demonstrate our
interest, enthusiasm and support for the space program,'' said
Julie Jones, tourist director for the local chamber.
   The 7,000 employees of Lockheed Space Operations Co., which
processes the shuttle for launch, will get personal letters and
commemorative medallions with the Discovery mission insignia from
their boss, Lockheed President Doug Sargent.
   Lockheed, which laid off close to 2,000 workers in the months
after the Challenger accident, is back at full strength and
``extremely excited about the program resumption,'' said spokesman
John Williams.
   ``Each time we've hit a milestone in the processing flow,
enthusiasm has built. Now, our people are feeling we're almost
there,'' Williams said. ``Discovery is a good bird. Everybody's
confident.''
   Besides the immediate impact of the 26th shuttle mission, Space
Coast people are counting on a new national commitment for
commercial launches and space activity.
   Since the shuttle has now been designated primarily for military
and governmental cargo, sharp increases are expected in the use of
medium and heavy unmanned rockets for commercial satellites and
private-industry research in space.
   Aerospace executives are working with NASA, Gov. Bob Martinez
and other state and local officials on a ``Spaceport Florida''
concept, providing a private-sector highway to space. The policy
encourages other commercial initiatives in the space program.
   ``There is a huge pent-up demand for research and development in
space because of the moratorium on launching,'' said Rafert.

   Michael Dukakis set aside today to cram for his
debate showdown with George Bush after responding to the Republican
nominee's visit to Boston with a pointed attack labeling him
``AWOL'' in the nation's war on crime and drugs.
   The Democratic presidential nominee was spending the entire day
with his staff and advisers preparing for Sunday's debate. His only
scheduled public appearance was an early morning game of catch with
Boston Red Sox center fielder Ellis Burks outside Dukakis' home.
   In town to help Dukakis prepare is New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley,
and the Democratic nominee planned to take part in a mock debate
after morning briefings.
   Dukakis spent part of Thursday preparing for the debate but he
was forced to alter his schedule to defend his record on crime from
attacks by Bush, who popped into Boston to pick up a police union
endorsement.
   ``His administration has waged not a war on crime but a war
against crime control programs,'' Dukakis told a rowdy afternoon
rally outside his Statehouse office.
   ``We're here to give George Bush what Joe Friday used to ask
for: the facts ma'am, just the facts,'' Dukakis told the crowd of
law enforcement officials and supporters before criticizing Bush
and the Reagan administration for cutting aid to local police and
for allowing drug imports into the United States to soar.
   The law enforcement officials, representing 100,000 officers in
eight states, were quickly summoned to Massachusetts in a Dukakis
effort to blunt the impact of the Bush endorsement by leaders of
the 1,500-member Boston police union.
   One of them, representing the largest police organization in
Bush's adopted home state of Texas, prepared the crowd for Dukakis
with a fiery attack on Bush.
   ``I'm the only damn Texan in ton today representing police
officers,'' said Ron DeLord of the Combined Law Enforcement
Associations of Texas, which represents 8,000 officers across
Texas. DeLord said Bush failed in his assignment to curb drug
trafficking across the Texas border.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, in town to help with debate
preparation, also pitched in at the Dukakis counterattack.
   ``I'm tired of this pandering,'' Cuomo said of the Bush
campaign. ``I'm tired of the simplistics and the distortions by
people like the vice president.''
   For his part, Dukakis delivered an emotional rhetorical flogging
of the vice president that delighted his partisan audience and
seemed to invigorate Dukakis.
   ``We're here today to investigate a felony _ assault and battery
on the truth,'' Dukakis said. ``What George Bush is doing to the
truth in this campaign is a crime.''
   For weeks, Dukakis aides have been fuming at what they see as
Bush's misrepresentation of Dukakis' record on crime and the
environment and of the Massachusetts economy.
   Dukakis stepped into the fray Thursday, saying Bush came to
Boston two weeks ago to ``impersonate an environmentalist'' and was
back again to ``impersonate a law enforcement officer.'' The
Massachusetts governor also said Bush has ``mugged the truth''
every time he has spoken about the state's economy.
   Dukakis noted that crime in Massachusetts has dropped 13.7
percent in the past five years while the federal rate has risen,
and he touted Masschusetts' ranking as the industrial state with
the lowest homicide rate.
   Dukakis also addressed an issue at the heart of Bush's effort to
portray the Democrat as soft on crime _ a Massachusetts furlough
program that until amended earlier this year allowed passes to
first-degree murderers.
   Dukakis said the federal government last year granted furloughs
to nearly 16,000 inmates, including ``hundreds and hundreds of drug
pushers and drug traffickers.''
   One reason leaders of the police union said they endorsed Bush
was because Dukakis did not attend the funerals of three Boston
officers recently killed in the line of duty. Dukakis, in an
apparent challenge to the argument, said the suspect in one of the
slayings had been paroled from a federal prison after serving less
than half of his 15-year term for bank robbery.

<HEAD>Quayle a Negative So Far for Republicans, Pollsters Say</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leading pollsters say the choice of Dan Quayle
as a running mate has done more harm than good for Republican
George Bush, but they're far from predicting it will cost Bush the
presidential election.
   Those poll takers who point to the preference among voters for
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as a possible successor to the presidency point
out that the vice presidential running mate doesn't normally decide
the outcome of an election. They also point to some negative
feelings toward Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
   ``I believe Quayle could be Bush's Achilles heel,'' CBS News
pollster Warren Mitofsky said Thursday at a panel discussion
sponsored by the National Council on Public Polls.
   Mitofsky said his surveys show that on the question of who is
preferred for vice president, Bentsen or Quayle, the Democrat is
preferred by a two-to-one margin.
   Mitofsky said that among the group of voters paying the most
attention to the campaign, Dukakis held a slight lead. But he said
when this group was asked who they would favor if no running mates
were involved, Bush led.
   ``They'll vote for Bush over Dukakis if that's all they have to
do, but if you put Quayle in the mix, they go the other way,'' he
said. ``It's only a small move, but it's there.''
   Gordon Black, who polls for CNN and USA Today, said Quayle has a
2-to-3 percentage point overall negative effect for Bush in his
polls.
   His survey shows 23 percent saying they are less likely to vote
for Bush because of Quayle, while 6 percent said they were more
likely to vote for Bush because of his running mate.
   But Black said that appeared to be offset by an unrelated
finding that the ``liberal'' tag Bush has pinned to Dukakis has
caused 30 percent of respondents to say they are less likely to
vote for the Democrat. Nine percent said liberalism made them more
likely to support Dukakis.
   Richard Wirthlin, who is conducting surveys for the White House
and the Republican National Committee, did not not release his poll
findings on the Indiana senator, but he said in an interview later
that they were in line with Mitofsky's.
   ``On the net, it has been more negative than positive,'' said
Wirthlin.
   ``The question is to what extent do people vote for the ticket
because of the vice president,'' he said. ``In the past, that has
not been a big issue.
   ``Personally I think two things: One, before this campaign is
over Quayle is going to look better than he does right now. Two, 99
percent of Americans are going to vote for either Bush or Dukakis
and not for Quayle or Bentsen.''
   Quayle's negatives appeared most recently in an NBC News-Wall
Street Journal poll released Thursday. More voters viewed him
unfavorably than favorably, 37 percent to 33 percent, a reversal
from his 40-22 favorable rating last month. Half the voters said
Quayle was a bad choice.
   A Gallup poll for the Times Mirror Corp. also referred to Quayle
as ``the Achilles heel of the Republicans.'' While Quayle did not
appear to be an issue on which votes were swinging directly, poll
analyst Norman Ornstein said Quayle would be ``more of an issue
that the overall numbers suggest'' because of questions over Bush's
judgment.
   Peter Hart, a frequent pollster for Democratic candidates, said
negative reaction to Quayle has increased over the past month _
apparently as doubts about his qualifications were considered more
fully by Americans.
   Bush maintains a small lead over Dukakis in most recent national
polls. Hart said that should Dukakis win, however, Quayle would be
cited as the major reason.
   ``You look a month later, and it's much worse for Dan Quayle,''
said Hart, who is polling for the Chicago Tribune. ``The perception
over the last month has gone steadily more negative, and the
perception persists that he's just really not ready to be either
vice president or president.''
   Wirthlin said Quayle has a chance to ease negative perceptions
about him in his debate with Bentsen on Oct. 5, and he predicted
Quayle will look better by Election Day.

   Republican Presidential Nominee George Bush lost
support among Democrats who voted for President Reagan in 1984, but
more voters are viewing Democrat Michael Dukakis as too liberal, a
new poll says.
   The NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll Thursday showed Bush
leading Dukakis 45-41.
   Bush's running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, also lost
ground. More voters viewed him unfavorably than favorably, 37
percent to 33 percent, a reversal from his 40 percent to 22 percent
favorable rating last month. Half the voters said Quayle was a bad
choice.
   Twenty-five percent of the Reagan Democrats in the poll
supported Bush, down from 35 percent a month ago. The Democrats are
making a special effort, especially in the campaigning by Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, to win back those more conservative
Democrats.
   The survey of 2,360 likely voters in the poll had a margin of
error of two points, meaning that Bush and Dukakis were essentially
tied. Other recent polls have had similar results.
   A poll late last month after the Republican National Convention
put Bush ahead by 47 percent to 40 percent among likely voters.
   The newest poll, done Sept. 16 through Monday, found Bush
continuing to do better with men than with women, and losing ground
with women since last month.
   Although he lost ground with Reagan Democrats, Bush gained with
his criticism of Dukakis as liberal. A third of the voters polled
said Dukakis was too liberal to be a good president, up from 27
percent last month. The 54 percent who disagreed was down from 64
percent.
   Bush was rated as a good vice president by 54 percent and
Dukakis as a good governor by 52 percent. But the voters by 62-25
percent said being vice president was better training for the
presidency than being a governor.
   Bush led substantially among men, 50-38, but the support of
women flipped from 44-40 with Bush ahead last month to Dukakis
ahead by the same margin now.
   The overall result of 45 percent to 41 percent produced a margin
similar to those in an Atlanta Constitution poll done last week,
which put the race at 43-40, and a Washington Post-ABC News poll,
which put it at 50-46.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Children hawk contraband
cigarettes, chewing gum and cassette tapes at traffic lights.
Pickup trucks rumble by with 20 or more passengers crammed in the
back. Stray dogs rummage through garbage near open sewers.
   In the suburb of Petionville, a wealthy suburb overlooking the
city, a waiter in a spotless white dress shirt and black trousers
serves fish creole, wild duck and chicken in mushroom sauce to
visitors at Le Pote Restaurant.
   Less than a week after a military coup that sent Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy into exile, life is returning to normal in this city of 1
million, capital of the Western Hemisphere's most impoverished
nation.
   For the first time since the revolt Saturday night, the sound of
automatic weapons fire could not be heard early Thursday evening
from a house in Petionville, 20 minutes by car from downtown.
   Earlier in the day, an unidentified corporal had appealed to
soldiers over Radio Soleil, the Roman Catholic station, to stop
firing into the air because it was hampering the search for Tonton
Macoute henchmen, the dreaded private army of the 29-year Duvalier
dynasty.
   After President Jean-Claude Duvalier's flight to exile in France
in February 1986, the nation had been ruled by the
military-dominated governments of Namphy and civilian President
Leslie Manigat. Since Namphy's weekend overthrow, the Tonton
Macoutes had been shooting indiscrimately.
   The first indication that something momentous was happening came
on Saturday afternoon, when shots rang out in Champs de Mars Plaza
separating the luxurious National Palace from army headquarters.
   People fled in all directions. As they ran past the Sacre Coeur
Roman Catholic Church a few blocks from the plaza, rumors spread
that a massacre like one that happened a week earlier had occurred.
   Macoutes fired guns from a speeding pickup. Several cars crashed
in the rush from danger.
   At 6 p.m., Radio Haiti Inter failed to broadcast its evening
news program, substituting instead music that in the United States
would be called ``easy-listening.''
   At about 2 a.m. Sunday, state television came on the air to show
an army sergeant, Joseph Heubreux, wearing helmet and combat
fatigues. He introduced Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, who said he had
accepted an offer to become president and promised a return to
democracy.
   Haiti's Mais Gate International Airport closed immediately after
the coup, but reopened Monday. Normal radio and TV broadcasting
resumed Sunday morning.
   Throughout the week, state TV showed Olympic Games coverage from
Seoul, Korea, interrupting programming from time to time to deliver
announcements from the new military government.
   The first days after the coup soldiers and civilians took
revenge on suspected perpetrators of a massacre on Sept. 11 at St.
John Bosco Roman Catholic Church in the La Saline slum, where thugs
with machetes, guns, clubs and spikes had slaughtered 13 people and
wounded 77 others. The church later was burned.
   On Sunday, a mob supported by soldiers pillaged the home of
Port-au-Prince Mayor Franck Romain, widely believed to be a Macoute
leader responsible for the church massacre.
   People huddled on downtown street corners during the night, as
if waiting for something to happen. Rumors circulated that an army
purge of the Tonton Macoutes was imminent.
   The next day, two suspected Macoutes were killed outside the
gutted church, one shot by a soldier and one beaten or stoned to
death by a mob, according to independent radio reports. At least
one of the bodies was burned and left on the sidewalk in front of
the church.
   At least three other bodies reportedly were burned Tuesday.
People stopped by to gape at the smoldering pile.
   Meanwhile, rebellious soldiers were arresting their commanders
and depositing them unharmed outside army headquarters. About 200
people stood on the sidewalk across from the colonial-style,
two-story building on Wednesday waiting for the next arrival.
   A street vendor working the crowd sold snow cones from a wooden
cart, scraping ice from a slab and pouring syrup from old liquor
bottles.

   A gunman ``who never said a word'' killed two
people Thursday in an auto parts store, then fatally wounded a
police officer and a custodian at a nearby school before police
shot the man dead, authorities said.
   A city garbage man also was wounded, as was a second police
officer at the Montefiore School on the city's West Side, and it
was the injured officer who gunned down the man, said Chicago
Police Superintendent LeRoy Martin.
   The dead police officer was Irma Ruiz, 40, a mother of four who
had been on the force 12 years, Martin said.
   The gunman, described by a friend as full of anger since his
combat service in Vietnam, had a history of battery complaints and
drug use, Martin said. ``I'm assuming he may have had some type of
grievance but I don't know.
   ``All the witnesses state that this individual never said a
word'' in the store before opening fire, Martin added.
   At an afternoon news conference, Martin gave the following
account:
   The gunman, Clemie Henderson, 40, walked into the Comet Auto
Parts store about 10 a.m. and shot and killed two clerks behind the
counter, John Van Dyke, 41, and Robert Quinn, 26. Henderson missed
a third clerk, who pretended to be hit and fell to the ground.
   Quinn died with a pencil in one hand and a telephone in another.
   Henderson then walked out a side entrance and encountered city
garbage man Laplose Chestnut, Jr., 34, fired his .38-caliber
handgun at Chestnut and shot him in the hand. Chestnut was in fair
condition at Cook County Hospital, said spokeswoman Wanda Robertson.
   Henderson headed for Montefiore, a school serving about 135
troubled boys, where he shot and killed custodian Arthur Baker, 33,
who was outside the building.
   At the door he met Mrs. Ruiz and officer Greg Jaglowski, 38, who
had been called to the school to deal with an unruly youth. Ms.
Ruiz was felled with a bullet to the chest and Jaglowski was shot
in the legs.
   ``The offender retreated to a room, emptied out the empty shells
from his revolver and reloaded with six fresh rounds,'' Martin said.
   When Henderson came back into the hall, he exchanged fire with
Jaglowski, who shot him twice in the chest. Police found 22 more
rounds of ammunition on Henderson.
   Martin said of Jaglowski, ``He's a genuine hero.''
   The Rev. C. Ferguson, who lives near the school, said he saw the
gunman after he left the store and headed toward the school. ``He
said, `Get out of the way, don't nobody move,''' Ferguson said.
   Students at the school were in classes, said Principal Bernard
Karlin.
   Crisis intervention workers were at the school to help students
deal with any emotional problems that may arise, said Chicago
Schools Superintendent Manford Byrd, who went to the scene soon
after the shootings.
   Martin said Henderson lived in the neighborhood and police found
literature in his apartment indicating he worked as a model and
hairdresser.
   Investigators also found a picture of him dressed in military
fatigues and holding an M-1 rifle. A friend of Henderson's, David
Finke, said he served as an Army combat infantryman in Vietnam
during the late 1960s and early 1970s.
   ``I think it is fair to say he carried his disturbance from the
Vietnam era into the present,'' said Finke, chairman of the Midwest
Committee for Military Counseling, an agency that counsels
veterans, current members of the armed forces and those considering
enlisting.
   ``I think Clem had a great deal of anger. I always sensed he was
working very hard to be under control,'' Finke said. ``Something in
these last few weeks just lost control of that.''
   Finke said Henderson had three children by a first marriage and
had remarried, but separated from his second wife in July. He said
Henderson also had worked as a teacher for a chain of beauty
colleges and as a model until he quit about two years ago,
complaining of being ``burned out.''
   ``Had my two officers not been in the school ... I'm afraid we
would have had another incident such as what occurred in the north
suburbs,'' Martin said.
   He was referring to the May 20 shooting rampage of Lori Dann in
Winnetka. She shot an 8-year-old student and six others before
turning her gun on herself.
   Jaglowski was in serious but stable condition at Mount Sinai
Hospital, with gunshot wounds of the right thigh and lower left
leg, said spokeswoman Diann Smith.

forensic experts scrutinize fingerprints, Peter McDonald uses his
experience as a former Firestone tire designer to uncover
crime-solving clues.
   ``I think it requires a trained eye,'' said McDonald, 58, who
has taught tire print identification at police academies in about
15 states and a few Canadian provinces. He spoke at an FBI Academy
symposium in 1984.
   McDonald testified this week at a preliminary court hearing in
the Kunz family slayings, a case that investigators labored on for
more than a year before charging a man with being a party to the
murders.
   Four family members were found shot to death July 5, 1987. A
fifth member was missing until her remains were found nearly nine
months later.
   McDonald testified that a gap left by a stone in a tire cut
positively identified a tire on the charged man's car as having
made a track found at the murder scene.
   ``No other tire in the world could have made that impression,''
he told the court.
   McDonald, who designed tires for 28 years at Firestone Tire and
Rubber Co., began identifying tire prints about 10 years ago when
he was contacted by police in California. He later started a
Hudson, Ohio, consulting firm.
   ``Being a manager of tire design, I was involved in checking
other people's work,'' he said Thursday. ``That training, plus the
fact that I'm an artist and studied architecture, I feel gives me a
leg up on people who come to this from a strictly scientific
background.''
   At the FBI laboratory in Washington, supervisory Special Agent
William J. Bodziak said he has articles dating back to the 1930s
that refer to tire identification.
   But identifying tire prints is less common than fingerprints or
shoe prints and ``there's no real course'' to teach it, Bodziak
said. The six FBI examiners who do tire identification work at the
lab have learned their trade mainly from other examiners and
experience, he said.
   The Michigan State Police Crime Laboratory has operated a
computer program to help identify tire tracks for at least eight
years in East Lansing, but analysts there receive ``mostly
on-the-job training and training by Mr. McDonald,'' said Frank
Schehr, assistant director.
   ``Peter McDonald ... is quite an expert in that area,'' he said.
   McDonald said he has testified in four homicide cases, one rape
case and a civil case involving a young girl who was hit by a
vehicle.
   On Wednesday, he was in Marathon County Circuit Court in a
preliminary hearing for Chris Jacobs III, a 22-year-old
north-central Wisconsin man charged with five counts of being a
party to the first-degree murders of the Kunz family members.
   McDonald spent most of the day on the stand explaining his
methods.
   He said he begins with scale photographs of the tracks found at
the crime scene and inked impressions of any suspect tires.
   He identifies tread patterns by studying the length of pitches
or zigzag patterns around the tire. The manufacturer varies these
lengths to help reduce the amount of noise the tires make, he said.
   He then compares 13 items in the prints, including the shapes of
the tire tread elements, the number of raised ribs and size of
pitch lengths, to determine the brand and design of tire.
   McDonald said he looks for variations in the tire tracks and
inked impressions to see if they share characteristics of the same
tire manufacturing mold.
   If the tracks and impressions share the same brand and mold
characteristics, McDonald uses the manufacturer's tire plans to
study the general accidental characteristics, or signs of wear.
   But to make a positive identification, McDonald said he needs to
find something like a gap caused by a stone or indications of a
torn piece of rubber.

<HEAD>Bush Pledges to Modernize Conventional Weapons</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Bush meeting with Shevardnadze at 8 a.m. EDT.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush is pledging to
modernize existing conventional weapons in Europe through a program
under consideration at the Pentagon for the past two years.
   The Republican presidential nominee, in a speech Thursday to a
GOP fund-raiser in Houston, said he would seek to ``maximize the
value of our military investments'' through the more efficient use
of ``existing weapons systems and those in the pipeline now.''
   Bush was taking a break from debate preparations today to hold a
private meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Craig Fuller, Bush's chief of staff, said the session with
Shevardnadze will give the vice president ``a chance to look ahead
a little bit.''
   ``This is an area where I think Americans don't want to change
course,'' Fuller told reporters aboard Air Force Two. ``I think it
should be seen as an opportunity for George Bush to build on the
record'' of the Reagan administration.
   On Thursday, Bush told a GOP fund-raiser that it was not
necessary to ``match the Soviets bullet for bullet and tank for
tank.''
   The vice president shared the stage at the $1,000 a person
gathering with President Reagan, who told the audience that
Democrats ``use our words and borrow our tunes, but the song is way
out of key.'' The banquet generated about $3.1 million, said Bush
spokeswoman Sheila Tate.
   In his speech, Bush did not elaborate on the defense plan, but
aides said that the vice president's ``Competitive Strategies
Initiative,'' to be outlined in greater detail over the next few
days by Bush and Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, would involve a
shifting of strategies to deal more effectively with the defense of
Europe.
   The move could mean a reduction of U.S. troops overseas in the
future as other, high-technology weapons systems are pressed into
service, the aides said.
   Modernization of conventional forces has been a major proposal
of Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis. The program also has been
under review at the Defense Department, Bush aides said.
   Bush was to continuing preparing today for Sunday's nationally
televised debate with Dukakis and had no events scheduled after the
morning meeting with the Soviet foreign minister.
   With just days to go to the showdown, Bush forces sought to
throw Dukakis off guard with a blitz into his backyard Thursday to
collect an endorsement from the Boston Police Patrolmen's
Association.
   Bush called the endorsement ``a great boost'' even as Dukakis
supporters staged counter-rallies outside and on the steps of the
Massachusetts Statehouse.
   ``Who was it who said, the police aren't there when you need
them? They're wrong,'' Bush said at the event, which aides said
would be highlighted in a forthcoming Bush campaign commercial.
   Later in Houston, Bush told the GOP banquet, ``the differences
between me and the governor of Massachusetts couldn't be more
clear. I am the one with the Texas values.''
   Asked if Bush's remarks about conventional forces could suggest
a movement toward reducing the number of U.S. troops in Europe,
Bush spokeswoman Alixe Glen said, ``It could. It could mean there
would be less emphasis on that.''
   However, she said that the initiative did not automatically mean
that Bush favored such a reduction.
   Dennis Ross, Bush's foreign policy adviser, said that the
proposal was not intended to signal support for a troop reduction
and ``is simply a new management process for spending our money
smarter in new weapons systems of the future.''

<HEAD>Joke Collection Proves To Be Shocker For Students</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A collection of more than 10,000 jokes
included so many bigoted, sexist stories that the college students
who compiled them were shocked, a professor says.
   ``Some students were so disturbed they had to come and talk to
me about the nature of the jokes,'' Professor C. David Mortensen
said. ``Some were shocked at the brutality implicit in much of the
humor.''
   The spring semester assignment for the University of
Wisconsin-Madison students found that about 30 percent of the
10,000 jokes gathered were ethnically offensive and another 30
percent were sexually offensive, Mortensen said recently.
   About 60 students participated in the independent study, he said.
   The study showed nearly a third of the jokes gathered in the
Madison area were ethnic or racial, primarily demeaning Jewish,
Polish or black people.
   Middle-class white people, the main source of the jokes, rarely
tell jokes about themselves, Mortensen said.
   ``I think there's a connection between who we joke about and who
we're afraid of,'' Mortensen added. ``There's a lot of fear, anger,
aggressivity that is released towards people who make up less than
10 percent of the population in Madison.''
   Nearly one-third of the jokes were sexually offensive, relating
to differences in gender or lifestyle, he said.
   ``This material is extremely aggressive. It's lurid and it
suggests that we not only find jokes about sexuality funny, we
particularly find funny the sexual styles of people whose values
are incompatible with our own,'' Mortensen said.
   Other jokes were about babies, particularly dead babies, he
said, or about disabled people, animals, religion and, this being
an election year, politicians.
   Gary Hart, whose relationship with model Donna Rice cost him a
bid at the White House, was a prime target, Mortensen said.
   Mortensen expects to finish his project, entitled ``The Power of
Midwestern Ethnic Humor to Hurt and Heal,'' by the end of the
semester. He said he regards humor as a form of aggression yet a
powerful social lubricant.
   ``Jokes, laughter, ridicule and sarcasm allow us to have a cheap
thrill, a cheap triumph,'' he said. ``They allow us both to express
the tension and hostility that we feel towards people that are not
like us and, at the same time, they ease tensions.''

<HEAD>Minister Says 231 Killed By Militants In One Month, Emergency
Extended</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEXTER CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior official disclosed that at
least 231 people had been killed in rebel attacks by both Tamils
and Sinhalese in one month.
   Public Administration Minister Montague Jayawickreme said
Thursday the killings took place during between Aug. 16 and Sept.
15.
   Jayawickreme was speaking during a Parliament debate over
extending emergency rule in the island nation. After his speech,
the government again extended emergency rule for a month.
   Emergency rule gives the country's security forces wide-ranging
powers of arrest and detention. It has been extended monthly since
May 1983, when the Tamil insurgency began in the northern and
eastern provinces of Sri Lanka.
   Tamil militants, who claim they are discriminated against by the
island's Sinhalese majority, have waged a war for an independent
Tamil nation in the north and east, where they are a majority.
   More than 8,500 people have been killed in the war.
   Jayawickreme said the Sinhalese militants were responsible for
150 of the 231 slayings in the past month. Tamil insurgents had
killed 81 people, he said.
   Jayawickreme said that of the 150 people killed by the Sinhalese
People's Liberation Front, 51 were in public officials and 99
others were police informants and relatives of supporters of the
ruling United National Party.
   Of the 81 people killed by Tamil insurgents, 62 were civilians
and 19 were Lankan security personnel, he said.
   The People's Liberation Front has vowed to kill supporters of an
India-mediated peace accord signed in July 1987. The accord was
aimed at giving a greater measure of autonomy to Tamils.
   The Sinhalese extremists claim too many concessions were given
to Tamils, who are mostly Hindus and make up 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people.
   The Sinhalese form 75 percent of the island's population and
control its government and military.
   More than 450 people, including military and civilian supporters
of the government, have been victims of the Sinhalese group's
campaign since the accord was signed.

<HEAD>Accused Detroit Crack Kingpins Go On Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Small-town boys and girls kept in line by a
``beat-up crew'' were lured into operating a $3-million-a-day drug
ring that once accounted for half of Detroit's crack trade,
prosecutors and witnesses say.
   Opening arguments began Thursday in the federal trial of 14
members of the ring allegedly headed by four brothers, Billy Joe
Chambers, Larry Marlowe Chambers, Otis Bernard Chambers and Willie
Lee Chambers.
   Each grew up in Marianna, Ark., and allegedly returned to that
rural town from 1982 to 1987 to recruit teen-agers for the Detroit
operation, in what U.S. Attorney Roy Hayes called ``A Tale of Two
Cities.''
   The Chambers brothers and 10 other people are charged with
cocaine conspiracy, firearms and tax evasion. The trial before U.S.
District Judge Richard Suhrheinrich is expected to last six to
eight weeks.
   Crack and murder among youths has grown to a problem of
staggering proportions in the nation's sixth-largest city.
   Some 1,000 crack houses are operating here. And Detroit's
juvenile homicide rate reached 4.1 per 100,000 in 1986, the latest
year for which figures are available. That rate was more than three
times the 1986 rate of 1.3 in the 10 largest U.S. cities. Detroit
also has had the nation's highest per capita homicide rate for
cities over 100,000 population for most of the past 10 years,
according to FBI statistics.
   ``The Chambers brothers decided to recruit young people, 14- to
16-year-old people ... who were not streetwise, people who would
not rip them off,'' Hayes said in opening arguments.
   He said the organization had as many as 400 employees, operated
up to 300 crack houses _ which manufactured crack, cocaine's
smokeable form _ and cleared hundreds of thousands of dollars in
profits daily.
   Hayes' first witness, former organization member Patricia
Middleton, backed his descriptions of an expanding network of
trusted lieutenants and child drug dealers, kept in line by a
no-holds-barred ``wrecking crew or beat-up crew.''
   In March, 22 people were indicted. Four have pleaded guilty.
Four others remain fugitives.
   Authorities confiscated 41 cars, including Mercedes-Benz,
Cadillac and Jeep models, 250 weapons, $500,000 in cash and
$500,000 in jewelry in serving 107 search warrants leading to
indictments in the case.
   Defense attorneys said Hayes sought to base his case on
witnesses who were testifying in exchange for immunity.
   ``That is the lowest form of testimony the government can
present, someone who is trying to save his skin,'' said William E.
Bufalino II, representing defendant Kevin Duplessis.
   David Harris, representing defendant Morris Hampton, told the
jurors that by the trial's end, ``You will be reading a different
book: `Much Ado About Nothing.'''
   But Middleton, 33, of Detroit said she worked for about six
months as a driver picking up cash from crack houses before she
braved intimidation and went to police.
   Middleton wept as she described her decision to go to police
after Larry Chambers held a gun to her head and said if she talked,
``I'll blow your ... brains out.''
   She backed Hayes' descriptions of a network of trusted
lieutenants and child drug dealers kept in line by strict rules,
threats and violence.
   Larry Chambers beat one gang member for selling soap in place of
crack, another member was beaten with a baseball bat and a third
was pushed out of a window on the third floor of her apartment
building, she said.
   Middleton said she made money pickups for about six months,
earning $800 a week, but worked under threats from Larry Chambers
that the man she lived with would be hurt.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radical students staged an
anti-Olympics rally and attacked riot police with firebombs and
rocks today. Troopers fired tear gas to drive the protesters back.
   About 500 students, shouting ``Oppose dictatorial Olympics!''
attempted to march out of Korea University in eastern Seoul and
were blocked by hundreds of riot police in green combat fatigues
and black-visored helmets.
   Students hurled firebombs and rocks at the police, who used tear
gas and hurled back rocks during the half-hour clash.
   It appeared to be the first time riot police had used tear gas
in Seoul since the Olympics began Saturday. The government banned
tear gas in an effort to limit limit anti-government protests.
   No one was reported arrested or injured in the clash, which was
confined to the main gate in front of the school, about 15 miles
from the main Olympic venues.
   Radicals have staged a number of protests against the Olympics,
but they have been small and largely peaceful. Most Koreans are
critical of the protests and want the Games, which end Oct. 2, to
be a success.
   During the earlier campus rally, student leaders denounced the
South Korean government for not sharing the Olympics with communist
North Korea. They also claimed the government would use the Games
to cement authoritarian rule.
   Speakers said the Games were being used by the Seoul government
to perpetuate the division of the Korean Peninsula. The Games, they
said, should be shared to help reunite the two Koreas.
   Protesters also demanded the release of a student leader
arrested by police Thusday for organzing anti-government protests
in recent months.
   North Korea is boycotting the Olympics because its demand to be
a co-host was rejected by the International Olympic Committee,
which said the Olympics are awarded to a single city and cannot be
shared.
   The Korean Peninsula was divided at the end of World War II and
separate republics were founded in the north and south in 1948.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega canceled plans
to speak before the United Nations next week because of charges the
United States illegally put off issuing visas to members of his
delegation.
   U.S. officials said the problem arose because the Nicaraguans
submitted their request late.
   Speaking Thursday night when he announced cancellation of
Ortega's trip, Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Tinoco said at a news
conference, ``This arbitrary and illegal attitude constitutes a
denial of Nicaragua's rights.''
   Alejandro Bendana, secretary-general of the Foreign Ministry,
said in a telephone interview that the Reagan administration
deliberately was setting up obstacles to stop the Sandinista
government from speaking at the United Nations and the Organization
of American States.
   ``Evidently the Reagan administration is petrified that we may
sound reasonable,'' he said.
   The cancellation of the trip came two days after House Speaker
Jim Wright revealed a covert CIA operation to destabilize the
leftist government.
   It also comes two months after Nicaragua expelled U.S.
Ambassador Richard Melton and seven other diplomats, accusing them
of destabilizing the country. The United States retaliated by
expelling eight Nicaraguan diplomats from Washington.
   The U.S. Embassy notified the Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry on
Thursday that only half of the 60 visa requests for visits to the
United Nations and the Organization of American States in
Washington had been processed.
   It said the other visas _ for Cabinet ministers, high-level
foreign ministry officials and journalists _ would not be ready by
Saturday, when President Ortega and his delegation planned to leave
for the United States. Ortega planned to speak before the U.N.
General Assembly Wednesday in New York and Thursday before the
Organization of American States in Washington.
   ``We have not denied the Nicaraguans visas,'' State Department
spokesman Charles Redman said Thursday. ``We're processing their
visas. The Nicaraguans applied late.''
   Redman said U.S. officials normally require 15 working days for
processing Nicaraguan visa applications but that the Sandinista
officials made the request on Sept. 13 for a Sept. 24 arrival in
New York.
   But a high-level Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry official said the
15 working days applied only to visas for official state visits
between the two nations, such as those given to diplomats.
   American citizens who are not government employees do not need
visas to enter Nicaragua.
   Diplomatic relations between Nicaragua and the United States
have been strained for more than seven years. The Reagan
administration has supported Nicaraguan rebels since 1981 in their
war to oust the Sandinistas.
   Washington claims the Nicaraguan government threatens U.S.
national security by being a beachhead for communism. The
Sandinistas came to power in a 1979 revolutionary war that deposed
President Anastasio Somoza.
   The United States, saying the Sandinistas backed Marxist
guerrillas fighting in El Salvador, cut off economic aid to
Nicaragua in 1981 and imposed a trade embargo in 1985.
   On Tuesday, Wright, D-Texas, disclosed that the CIA had
instigated demonstrations aimed at provoking the Sandinista
government to take repressive actions.
   The Sandinistas in early July charged that the U.S. Embassy was
behind a plot to create internal disturbances. On July 11, the
Nicaraguan government expelled Melton and the seven diplomats,
accusing them of backing an anti-government demonstration a day
earlier.
   Washington dismissed the Sandinista claims and expelled
Nicaraguan Ambassador Carlos Tunnerman and seven of his colleagues.
   Wright's statements about the CIA attempting to foment internal
problems appeared to confirm earlier Sandinista claims.
   Managua has yet to make an official statement about Wright's
revelations. ``My impression is that it's no secret the Central
Intelligence Agency for the past eight years has been trying to
overthrow the government,'' Bendana said. ``The obvious can hardly
strike us as news.''

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis lashed out at George Bush's record on
crime as the Republican nominee ventured into his rival's backyard
to pick up a police union endorsement, a campaign break from
presidential debate preparation that the two White House contenders
could not ignore.
   With the first of two nationally televised debates just two days
away, Dukakis and Bush cleared their schedules today to pore over
briefing books and confer with staff and advisers on Sunday's
showdown.
   Dukakis is engaging in a mock debate and meeting with New Jersey
Sen. Bill Bradley. The Democratic presidential nominee also was
getting in a bit of physical exercise with an early morning game of
catch with Boston Red Sox center fielder Ellis Burks outside
Dukakis' Brookline home.
   Bush was spending the day cramming at the vice president's
residence.
   Negotiators for the two candidates reached agreement Thursday on
the final logistical obstacle to the debate _ the composition of
the panel. Jim Lehrer of public television's MacNeil@Lehrer
NewsHour will moderate the debate in Winston-Salem, N.C., and the
panelists will be ABC News anchor Peter Jennings, Anne Groer of The
Orlando Sentinel and John Mashek of The Atlanta Constitution, the
bipartisan commission on debates announced.
   While the two presidential candidates limited their appearances,
Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle did the same,
spending the day in Washington tending to Senate duties.
   Democrat Lloyd Bentsen was campaigning in three crucial states _
Illinois, Ohio and Pennsylvania where he was expected to reiterate
the ticket's stands on Social Security, trade and health care.
   The Democrats received some encouraging news from a national
poll that put the race at essentially a dead heat, but found a
slight dip in Bush's support since the week after the Republican
National Convention.
   The NBC News-Wall Street Journal survey of 2,630 likely voters
found Bush leading 45-41 percent compared with last month's poll
showing Bush ahead 47-40 percent.
   The margin of error was plus or minus two percentage points for
the survey, conducted Sept. 16 through Monday.
   On Thursday, Dukakis used Bush's visit to the Massachusetts
governor's home state to criticize the vice president's description
of himself as a crimefighter and environmentalist.
   ``We're here today to investigate a felony _ assault and battery
on the truth,'' an invigorated Dukakis told a rally outside the
Massachusetts statehouse. ``What George Bush is doing to the truth
in this campaign is a crime.''
   Earlier, Bush had traveled to Boston to pick up an endorsement
from the Boston Police Patrolmen's Association, a 1,500-member
union that has consistently supported Republican candidates.
   At the rally, Dukakis surrounded himself with police officers
from several Massachusetts departments as well as law enforcement
officials from Texas, Florida, Michigan and other states.
   He then launched into his attack, charging that ``for the past
eight years George Bush has been running with a crowd that wouldn't
know the rule of law if it hit them in the face.''
   Dukakis also said that when Bush toured polluted Boston harbor
earlier this month to criticize the governor's clean-up efforts,
the Republican nominee came ``to impersonate an environmentalist.''
   Bush, who received the police union's pledge of support on
Wednesday, formally accepted the endorsement and charged that
Dukakis is soft on crime.
   ``I'm here to receive this endorsement but also to make it clear
that I'm the one in this race who wants to strengthen law
enforcement,'' said Bush, who was surrounded by about 50 patrolmen,
all elected representatives of the police union.
   The leadership of the largest union in New England, in
explaining the Bush endorsement, cited Dukakis' revolving door
policy for criminals and his failure to attend the funerals of
three officers killed in the line of duty.
   Dukakis, in his remarks, noted that the suspect in the murder of
one of the officers was a repeat violent offender who had been
paroled from federal prison after serving less than half of a
prison term for bank robbery.
   ``That's what's going on in the federal system these days, my
friends,'' he said.
   After his stop in Boston, Bush joined President Reagan at a
fund-raiser in Houston, where the vice president pledged that if
elected he will work on reordering U.S. conventional defenses.
   Bush's plan, which has been under consideration at the Pentagon
for the past two years, is ``designed to ensure that we need not
match the Soviets bullet for bullet and tank for tank,'' the vice
president said.
   During the campaign, Dukakis has advocated modernizing
conventional forces in Europe.
   Reagan told the $3.1 million fund-raiser that the Democrats
``use our words and borrow our tune but the song is way out of
key.'' The president, without mentioning Dukakis' name, also said
the Democratic nominee flip-flopped on such issues as support for
the B-1 bomber.
   Meanwhile, Quayle urged Americans to judge the Soviet Union by
whether the superpower pulls back from ``global `pot stirring''' in
Afghanistan, Angola, Nicaragua and other nations.
   The Indiana senator also told a Los Angeles audience that
perestroika, or restructuring, in the Soviet Union has yet to live
up to its promise.
   Bentsen told a Silicon Valley audience that the Reagan
administration's ``do-nothing'' approach on trade has left the
United States ``dependent on Japan for 40 percent of the computer
chips used in our own weaponry.''

   This peasant hamlet today
mourned 10 villagers, a tenth of its population, slain by
government troops in what witnesses said appeared to be the largest
incidence of civilian killings in four years.
   The government, through the Armed Forces Press Office, said the
villagers were ``subversives'' who died fighting troops.
   But more than a dozen relatives and neighbors of the dead who
witnessed Wednesday's events told The Associated Press that the
seven men and three women were killed with grenades and rifle fire
after being detained in their homes or while carrying out their
daily tasks.
   Benedicto Reyes, a resident of the nearby village of Santa
Teresa, said about 100 soldiers marched past his house Tuesday
evening toward San Francisco, 30 miles east of San Salvador.
   At 5:30 the next morning, a squad appeared at the home of Jose
Atilio Rivas and his wife Maria Julia Argueta, according to Mrs.
Argueta.
   She said the soldiers thoroughly searched the home, then took
her husband away and ordered her to stay inside with the couple's
three young children.
   ``They said they were going to give him a talk,'' said Mrs.
Argueta. Her eyes red from weeping, she spoke only five feet from
where her husband's body lay in the village churchyard along with
the nine others.
   The 10 bodies, which villagers had carried in hammocks slung on
poles from the site of the killings a mile away, exhibited shrapnel
and gunshot wounds.
   Lucia Henriquez, 80, said she was watching her grandchildren
play in front of their adobe home Wednesday afternoon when soldiers
appeared and told her to take the children inside and remain there.
Her home is about 150 yards from the site of the killings.
   About the same time, according to several others detained in the
village schoolhouse, soldiers working from a list took four women
and one man from the school. One woman was released outside the
building, where more than half the villagers had been held most of
the day without food or water.
   According to the villagers, the other four were marched down a
rocky and muddy path to a ravine, where six others were being held.
   Mrs. Henriquez said she heard three loud blasts _ presumably
hand grenades _ and then sustained automatic rifle fire.
   The nearly 40 residents detained in the schoolhouse were
released Wednesday evening but prevented by the soldiers from going
down the path to the ravine. They found the bodies at dawn Thursday.
   A military press officer, asked Thursday about the villagers'
account, said the army had no further information but would
investigate the matter. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Relatives identified the victims as: Teresa Argueta, 47; Maria
Zoila Rivas, 45; Maria Jesus Sibrian, 27; Jose Maria Flores, Jose
Alfaro, Nicolas Alfaro, Francisco Alfaro, Ulises Sibrian, Jose
Atilio Rivas and Jesus Zepeda. The ages of the men were not known.
   Maria Gumercinda Melendez, 28, said she and her daughter Blanca
were walking to the nearby town of San Sebastian Wednesday when
they were detained by the troopers and held in the schoolhouse all
day.
   At mid-afternoon, the soldiers called the names of Ms. Argueta,
Ms. Rivas and Ms. Sibrian along with that of Francisco Alfaro and
Rosa Emilia Rivas, ahe said. The five stepped forward, were
blindfolded and led out.
   Ms. Rivas and others said troops accused the detainees of
supporting the Marxist-led Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front which has fought El Salvador's U.S.-backed government for
nearly nine years.
   ``I don't feel safe here anymore,'' Ms. Rivas said. ``I would
like to leave, but I don't have anywhere to go.''
   Shortly before dusk some men began using picks and shovels to
open a large common grave in a nearby harvested cornfield. The
villagers buried seven of the dead there after dark.
   Relatives said the other three would be buried today.
   The last reported mass killing of civilians attributed to the
army took place Aug. 30, 1984 in the town of Las Vueltas in
Chalatenango province. Thirty-four people were killed there,
according to local and international human rights groups. No
officer or soldier was ever prosecuted.
   On Thursday, leftist guerrillas mounted one of their most
successful operations in recent months, killing at least 15
soldiers in an attack on an army post in the eastern Morazan
province, an army communique said.

<HEAD>Quotes From the Presidential Campaign Trail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are some comments Thursday from the
presidential campaign trail:
   
   GEORGE BUSH, receiving the endorsement of the Boston Police
Patrolman's Association in Michael Dukakis' backyard: ``Who was it
said that the police aren't there when you need them?''
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, at a hastily planned but spirited
counter-rally, flanked by scores of police officers and elected
officials: ``We're here today to investigate a felony: assault and
battery on the truth. What George Bush is doing to the truth in
this campaign is a crime. We're here to give George Bush what Joe
Friday used to ask for: the facts, ma'am, just the facts.''
   
   CRAIG FULLER, Bush's chief of staff, saying the vice president
complained to a Panamanian official about drug-money laundering
during a visit five years ago, but did not discuss it with
Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega: ``The notion that Vice
President Bush would sit down with the president of Panama and
discuss drug-money laundering should be a plus.''
   
   LLOYD BENTSEN, criticizing the GOP record on Social Security:
``Over the past eight years, George Bush and Dan Quayle and the
Republican party have waged unrelenting guerrilla warfare against
Social Security.''
   
   PRESIDENT REAGAN, accusing Dukakis and Bentsen of stealing
issues from Republicans: ``But it just doesn't sound right. They
use our words and borrow our tune, but the song is way out of key.''
   
   DAN QUAYLE, defending the Reagan-Bush administration policy of
bankrolling Contra rebels in Nicaragua: ``There is something in
this country that is called the Monroe Doctrine ... (that) says
foreign powers coming into our hemisphere ... is against the
national interest of this country. ... There is nothing wrong with
reminding the American people ... (and) Gorbachev that the Monroe
Doctrine is alive and well in America.''

<HEAD>St. Patrick's Cathedral Will Keep Its Doors Open, Cardinal Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   St. Patrick's Cathedral will not change its
open-door policy despite the attack by a deranged, homeless man who
bludgeoned an elderly usher to death before being shot dead by
police, says Cardinal John O'Connor.
   The cardinal resanctified the historic midtown church Thursday,
referring to the rampage there Wednesday night as a ``special
sacrilege and tragedy.'' It was the first time in the church's
109-year history that the rite to cleanse and purify a profaned
sacred place was performed.
   O'Connor said the attacker, Jorge DelGado, 32, a Cuban
immigrant, was one of the many homeless people who seek refuge in
the church to avoid the elements or often just to find a place to
sleep.
   ``You can find them inside the church any time of the day,'' he
said, adding the Archdiocese of New York would not change its
open-door policy as a result of the incident. ``I would hate to see
us now get defensive.''
   O'Connor offered the morning Mass for the souls of both men:
DelGado, 32, a hulking ex-convict; and usher John Winters, 77, a
retired hospital guard from County Mayo, Ireland.
   Winters abandoned his retirement three years ago to work as an
usher at the landmark church on Fifth Avenue. ``He loved this
church and literally gave his life for it,'' the cardinal said.
   DelGado entered the country in May 1980 at Key West, Fla., a
political refugee using the name Jorge Cuellar Ayllon. Here he used
the names Cuellar and DelGado, received psychiatric care seven
times since 1983 _ most recently in April _ and had stayed
sporadically since 1986 at a men's shelter in Manhattan.
   In March, police took him to Roosevelt Hospital's psychiatric
ward after he created a disturbance at the cathedral. Police
requested he be held for evaluation, but the hospital released him,
the New York Post reported today.
   DelGado's date and place of arrival indicated he probably was
part of the Mariel boatlift, a wave of refugees from Cuba that
included released prison inmates and mental hospital patients.
   He had been arrested 11 times since April 1982, on charges
including robbery, weapons possession and assault. He pleaded
guilty to each charge and served a total of about 15 months in jail.
   DelGado frequented the cathedral in recent months, and in March
police removed him for being disruptive. He sometimes cursed
parishioners, once dashed a marble font to the floor and another
time pulled a crucifix from the wall, authorities said. But
Wednesday morning, 12 hours before his rampage, he took communion
before O'Connor and waited to receive the cardinal's blessing.
   That night, witnesses said, the 6-foot-4, 250-pound DelGado tore
off his clothes and ran into the cathedral, chanting under his
breath, carrying a pair of sneakers and some red carnations. He
beat a woman, clubbed Winters to death and struck and seriously
injured a police officer.
   Another officer killed him with a single shot.

<HEAD>IRS Asks Judge To Stop PTL's Religious Broadcasts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service says PTL
can't pay its bills and has asked a bankruptcy judge to stop the
ministry's religious broadcasting.
   In motions filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the IRS asked Judge
Reynolds to act Tuesday to terminate a lease between PTL and its
7-week-old spin-off, Heritage Ministries.
   The IRS objected to the lease when Reynolds approved it in July.
   If Reynolds agrees with the IRS, the ministry's 19-year-old talk
show _ first known as ``The PTL Club,'' later as ``The Jim and
Tammy Show'' and now as ``Heritage Today'' _ could go off the air
within a week.
   The PTL satellite network is carried by about 900 cable systems
and the ministry has estimated its worth at $15 million.
   PTL filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankrupcty code in June 1987, three months after PTL founder Jim
Bakker left following a sex-and-money scandal.
   All of PTL's property must be sold to pay creditors. One of the
largest creditors is the IRS, with a $55 million claim.
   Reynolds suggested last spring that PTL spin off its religious
functions into a separate ministry that would own no property and
owe none of PTL's debts. The idea was to give the ministry a chance
to continue after the liquidation of PTL itself.
   But Heritage Ministries is in trouble even if Reynolds rejects
the IRS motion, officials say.
   The new ministry's president, Don Edwards, said this week that
contributions have virtually ceased and that Heritage can't afford
to continue another month unless Reynolds grants permission to use
money from the sale of PTL real estate.
   Heritage Ministries was unable to make its first month's rent
payment of $117,000 for the use of PTL's broadcasting and church
facilities, the IRS said. It also said the ministry owes PTL
$125,000 for air time on the PTL satellite network.
   Contributions to Heritage Ministries in August were only
$703,000. As recently as March, PTL was taking in that much every
week.
   Last Saturday, Heritage Ministries suspended the operations of
its home for unwed mothers and dormitories for homeless,
drug-addicted and troubled men.
   Reynolds has instructed a federal bankruptcy trustee to
recommend a buyer for PTL by Tuesday. Reynolds said he has offers
from two or three unidentified groups. A bid by Bakker fell apart
earlier this month when he couldn't secure financing.
   In addition to the ministry, Fort Mill-based PTL owns a
Christian theme park, a hotel and land.

   Gunmen smashed their way into a
house in a Roman Catholic district of west Belfast today and killed
the owner as he came down the stairs to investigate the commotion,
police said.
   At least two gunmen took part in the pre-dawn attack, a police
spokesman said. They fled in a hijacked car that later was found
abandoned in a nearby Protestant enclave, he said.
   The killing bore the hallmarks of an attack by Protestant
militants, said the spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
No group immediately claimed responsibility.
   Police said the victim, who had been in bed with his wife, was
shot when he came down the stairs to investigate the break-in. The
couple's three children were asleep in other rooms, the spokesman
said.
   At least 70 people have been killed in political and sectarian
violence in the Protestant-dominated province this year.

<HEAD>Korean Theaters Closed To Protest Independent Imports Of U.S.
Films</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Major movie theaters in Seoul shut
down today to protest independent distribution of U.S. motion
pictures such as ``Fatal Attraction'' in South Korea.
   At least 32 cinema houses in Seoul took part in a one-day
strike, which came in retaliation for the distribution of ``Fatal
Attraction,'' the first U.S. film to be shown by distributors
dealing directly with American exporters.
   ``Oppose direct film distribution by U.S. exporters,'' read a
placard at one cinema.
   The new direct U.S. distribution of films to South Korean
cinemas, which bypasses local distribution companies, is part of
trade liberalization measures.
   ``Fatal Attraction'' is scheduled to be shown this weekend in 12
South Korean cinemas.
   Film directors, producers and distributors issued a statement
calling for the boycott of the film and withdrawal of U.S. movie
distribution offices. Opposition political parties and dissident
groups joined in with promises to support the boycott campaign.
   On Thursday, President Roh Tae-woo told the Cabinet that the
liberalization of South Korean markets would be inevitable to avoid
trade conflict with the United States, South Korea's biggest
trading partner. Roh called for freer but gradual imports of U.S.
films, agricultural and marine products.

   Four Americans protesting U.S. policy in
Central America ended their weeklong fast in front of the U.S.
Embassy by sharing tortillas and wine.
   The four, holding hands with Guatemalan supporters Thursday,
chanted, ``We all want peace and freedom in this world.'' They also
replaced protest banners affixed to the embassy gates with
Guatemalan flags.
   The protesters, who plan to return to the United States today,
are Dale Ashara-Davis, 34, of Baltimore; Sara Story, 26, and
Charlie Liteky, 57, both of Washington; and John Schuchardt, 49, of
New Haven, Conn.
   The protest began Sept. 14 when the Americans threw blood on the
embassy steps and chained themselves to the gates of the compound.
Authorities have not interfered with the protest.
   In Honduras, 16 Americans were arrested and deported after
similar demonstrations in front of the U.S. Embassy in Tegucigalpa,
the capital, and at the U.S. air base in Palmerola, 40 miles to the
northeast.
   The demonstrators, who belong to a group called Project
Independence, timed their protests to coincide with the Sept. 15
anniversary of Central America's independence from Spain in 1821.
   John Mateyko, a group spokesman in Washington, said last week
the protest was ``religious-based and non-violent'' against what
members view as ``the immoral and dangerous policy'' of the Reagan
administration in Central America.
   The U.S. government supports the government of El Salvador
against leftist insurgencies and has backed rebels in Nicaragua
fighting the leftist Sandinista government. It has supported
Guatemala against leftist rebels.

<HEAD>Bush Aide Denies Noriega-Link Story</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top aide to Vice President George Bush says
the Republican presidential nominee complained to a high-level
Panamanian official about drug-money laundering during a visit five
years ago but did not discuss it with Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, on two occasions Thursday
discussed the 1983 Bush-Noriega meeting with reporters after a
British television documentary quoted a former senior Noriega aide
as saying Bush had complained to the general about money laundering.
   The assertion by Col. Roberto Diaz Herrera contradicts Bush's
contention that the Reagan administration took action against
Noriega as soon as it learned of alleged drug activity by Panama's
military leader.
   Noriega was indicted in federal court on drug charges in
February, and U.S. sanctions began against Panama earlier this year.
   ``This story is something we've discussed before. It's not
something we've attempted to hide,'' Fuller said. Later, Fuller
said again ``it is not news'' and said the Bush campaign wanted to
``clear up any lingering questions'' before Sunday's debate with
Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   The vice president's staff confirmed Bush met with Panama's
then-President Ricardo de la Espriella and other officials,
including Noriega for 45 minutes during a refueling stopover in
Panama on Dec. 11, 1983, at the Panama City airport.
   Fuller said a review of still-classified briefing papers on the
meeting inidcated that Noriega did not speak during the session on
drug-money laundering or on anything else of substance, but he
added ``The notion that Vice President Bush would sit down with the
president of Panama and discuss drug-money laundering should be a
plus.''
   He said Espriella assured Bush at the meeting that his
government would step up ``efforts to try to curtail this
laundering.''
   Fuller also denied an allegation that Noriega had information _
on alleged training of Nicaraguan Contra soldiers in Panama _ with
which he planned to blackmail the vice president.
   Fuller said, ``That's a foolhardy notion. We don't believe he's
blackmailing us.''
   Diaz and Jose I. Blandon, a former senior intelligence officer
in Panama, were quoted as saying Noriega claims to have pictures
and tape recordings that would link Bush or his aides to secret
training of Nicaraguan rebels.
   From October 1984 to October 1986, U.S. law prohibited any U.S.
government aid to the Contras in their fight to topple Nicaragua's
leftist Sandinista government. The documentary did not say when the
pictures were taken nor when the tape recordings were made.
   ``We have learned that as early as 1983 ... George Bush sat down
with Gen. Noriega to complain about the laundering of drug money in
Panama,'' reporter Julian Manyon said on the Thames Television
program, which was screened for reporters Wednesday.
   Manyon said the meeting raised ``important questions'' about
Bush's contention the administration acted as soon as it learned of
allegations against Noriega concerning the laundering of drug
profits.
   In an interview from Venezuela Diaz said he once saw Noriega
examining photographs which apparently showed Contras being
secretly trained in Panama under an arrangement with Lt. Col.
Oliver North, the White House aide dismissed over the Iran-Contra
affair in which profits from arms sales to Iran were funneled to
the Contras.
   Blandon, who has been a witness at a Senate Foreign Relations
Committee hearing investigating Noriega, said he believed ``people
inside the Bush campaign are aware of the threat that Noriega poses
for them'' because the general has sent a message telling Bush
campaign officials he has the tape recordings. The documentary was
to be broadcast Thursday night on Britain's commercial Independent
Television Network.

<TEXT>
   Leaders canceled another effort to elect
a new president as Lebanese awakened today to life under rival
Christian and Moslem governments.
   The sectarian strife threatened to reignite a 13-year civil
conflict that has taken more than 130,000 lives.
   Today's scheduled session of Parliament to elect a new chief of
state was called off after President Amin Gemayel named an interim
military government led by a Christian. The Maronite Catholic
president announced the caretaker Cabinet on Thursday night _ five
minutes before his six-year term expired.
   Moslem leaders branded his move a virtual coup and vowed support
for the existing Moslem-led Cabinet.
   The denunciations came Thursday on a day of renewed religious
violence. Three leaders of the main Shiite Moslem militia, Amal,
were assassinated earlier in the day, and Christians battled
Moslems for two hours along Beirut's dividing Green Line. One
Christian was reported killed.
   Though Gemayel's move was aimed at assuring a measure of unity
in the crisis, it initially appeared to have the opposite effect.
Three Moslem appointees immediately refused to serve in the
Cabinet, now led by army commander Gen. Michel Aoun, a Maronite
Catholic.
   ``This is a midget coup d'etat. It's not going to lift off the
ground,'' said Druse Moslem chieftain Walid Jumblatt in a statement
broadcast by Moslem radio stations in Beirut.
   Jumblatt said the ``only legal government is that of acting
Prime Minister Salim Hoss,'' a Sunni Moslem.
   Gemayel's choice of Aoun as prime minister came after leading
Moslem politicians refused to take part in an interim Cabinet
headed by a civilian Maronite prime minister.
   An unwritten national covenant calls for Lebanon's president to
be a Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Moslem and the speaker
of Parliament a Shiite Moslem.
   Gemayel, 45, named the transition government because Parliament,
deeply divided along religious lines, failed to elect a new
president Thursday. Christian deputies opposed presidential
candidates backed by Syria, the nation's main power broker, and
boycotted voting.
   Today's scheduled parliamentary session was the third failed
attempt in five weeks to elect a new president.
   ``The session is postponed until a date that will be announced
later,'' said a terse statement read by Parliament Secretary Ihsan
Abu Khalil.
   The constitution bars Gemayel from seeking another term.
   Aoun, 53, had warned on Wednesday that his 42,000-man army would
take control of Lebanon if no new president was elected before
Gemayel's term expired.
   But after the ceremony to hand over power, Aoun said: ``My
program is to arrange the speedy election of a new president.''
   Aoun and his ministers, who represent the six main religious
sects of Lebanon, keep their top military posts.
   Refusals to serve in the caretaker Cabinet came quickly from
Maj. Gen. Mahmoud Abu Dergham, a Druse; Col. Lutfi Jaber, a Shiite;
and Brig. Gen. Nabil Qoraitem, a Sunni.
   Aoun, asked if he would govern with only two Christian members
besides himself, said: ``I haven't been formally informed of their
(the Moslems') rejection yet.''
   Also named to Aoun's Cabinet were Col. Issam Abu Jamra, Greek
Orthodox; and Brig. Gen Edgar Maalouf, Greek Catholic.
   Aoun will probably not be able to cross the Green Line into the
Moslem sector, where the prime minister's office is located.
Military sources said he was commuting between the presidential
Baabda Palace and his headquarters in nearby Yarze today.
   In his televised farewell address, Gemayel said,``Today should
have been a festival in which we rejoice over the election of a new
president .... But the people of war were stronger than peace.''
   A police spokesman said Amal leaders Daoud Daoud, Mahmoud Fakih
and Hassan Sbeiti died instantly when gunmen raked their car with
machine-gun fire and rocket-propelled grenades in south Beirut's
seaside Ouzai district.
   Daoud and Fakih led an April crackdown on Hezbollah, the
Iranian-backed Party of God organization. Security sources said
Hezbollah vowed to kill them, but no group immediately claimed
responsibility.
   Two of the three candidates running for president _ former
President Suleiman Franjieh, 78, and Parliament Deputy Mikhail
Daher, 58 _ were chosen by Syria, which has about 40,000 troops in
Lebanon.
   The third, veteran politician Raymond Edde, 75, opposes all
foreign meddling in Lebanon. He leads in public opinion polls.

<TEXT>
   The State Department is optimistic that
Malaysia and Singapore will uphold ``an underlying commitment to
fundamental democratic values'' despite recent controversial
arrests in the two Asian countries, says a senior department
official.
   The official, David F. Lambertson, deputy assistant secretary of
state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, also says it would be
premature to judge whether the independence of Malaysia's judiciary
has been eroded by the recent removal of the Supreme Court
president and the suspension of five justices in a dispute with the
prime minister and parliament.
   Lambertson told a congressional panel Thursday that American
diplomats have voiced concern about such ``disquieting
developments'' as the Malaysian Supreme Court controversy and long
detentions without trial under the two countries' internal security
laws.
   But ``we are optimistic that an underlying commitment to
fundamental democratic values will continue'' in both, he added.
   Lambertson's testimony drew sharp questioning and criticism from
some members of the House human rights subcommittee.
   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., said he will press for approval of a
resolution urging Singapore to release all those detained without
trial for peaceful dissent and declaring that the U.S. Embassy in
Singapore should continue normal diplomatic contacts with citizens
who monitor human rights or are in opposition to Prime Minister Lee
Kuan Yew's government.
   Weiss cited Singapore's expulsion last May of E. Mason
Hendrickson, an American diplomat who met with anti-government
lawyers as another area of concern. The United States retaliated
with the expulsion of a Singapore diplomat from Washington.
   Weiss also demanded that Lambertson acknowledge that eight
Singapore dissidents recanted under duress a statement alleging
physical abuse of detainees that they had issued after being
arrested in 1987 and accused of a communist conspiracy. The
dissidents were released, but Lambertson reported that they changed
the statement while under re-arrest this year.
   ``I don't think it behooves me to speculate on individual
motives of why people say one thing on one occasion and another
thing on another occasion,'' Lambertson told Weiss.
   Describing Lambertson's testimony as ``so bland that it could be
a recipe for some kind of soup'' Weiss questioned whether American
diplomats were adequately conveying to Malaysia and Singapore ``the
passionate commitment of the U.S. to human rights.''
   Lambertson replied that ``the level of passion depends on the
individual,'' but he could assure the subcommittee that human
rights abuses are carefully investigated and that ``there is no
doubt on the part of the Singapore or Malaysian governments as to
our point of view.''
   Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., said Malaysia and Singapore ``are
very, very important countries to the United States. We place a
high value on our relationship with them, therefore are concerned
how these governments treat their own people.''
   ``It is always difficult to criticize a friend,'' he added, and
``we are hopeful for ... some constructive suggestions on how best
to go about conveying the concerns of Congress and the
administration.''

   Armenians stayed away from work and school in two
southern republics today and food was running out in one area as
tanks and soldiers patrolled to prevent further escalation of a
bloody ethnic dispute.
   In the republic of Armenia, hundreds of soldiers were deployed
throughout the capital, Yerevan, said the deputy director of
Armenia's official news agency, Armenpress.
   ``There are troops and tanks. I don't want to say the whole city
is surrounded, but at Lenin Square and other areas where there are
government buildings there are hundreds of soldiers,'' said the
Armenpress official. He spoke on condition of anonymity in a
telephone interview.
   Many businesses were closed by the strike, said the deputy
director of Armenia's official news agency, Armenpress. He said the
subway, airport and railroad were running but many buses were not.
   The Armenians are demanding that Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous
enclave in neighboring Azerbaijan that is primarily Armenian, be
made part of their own republic.
   In Nagorno-Karabakh today, factories and schools were closed in
a strike and a curfew was in effect, a resident said.
   The resident, who identified herself only as a worker for the
state broadcasting authority Gostelradio, said soldiers were
patrolling the streets of Stepanakert, the region's main city, in
tanks and armored personnel carriers. Asked how many troops were
patrolling, she said: ``There are more of them than us.''
   Food was in short supply because of the strike, the woman said.
``There's nothing in the stores except dairy products and bread.
There's no meat or anything else,'' she said.
   A man who identified himself as another worker at the radio
station said the soldiers were insulting people and drinking.
``These are fascists. They are animals,'' he said.
   In Yerevan, several deputies of Armenia's parliament, the
Supreme Soviet, had agreed at a rally by an estimated 500,000
people Thursday night to press again for an emergency parliament
session on the annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh, the Armenpress
official and activist Rafael Popoyan said.
   Armenia's Supreme Soviet endorsed the annexation demand in June,
but Azerbaijani and central authorities in Moscow refused to give
their consent. Armenian activists want the body to issue another
annexation call, and say more than the required one-third of the
340 deputies has signed a petition calling for a full session.
   Armenian authorities contend some of the deputies were pressured
into signing illegally, Popoyan said today.
   Armenians have vowed to continue the strike, which they began
Sept. 16, until a Supreme Soviet session is held.
   State-run television on Thursday night showed armored personnel
carriers on Yerevan streets and said similar measures had been
taken in 16 other areas of Armenia with a ``mixed population,''
apparently meaning areas where both Armenians and Azerbaijanis
live. The broadcast also showed three people it said were staging a
hunger strike in downtown Yerevan.
   The official news agency Tass said the strike in Yerevan had
spread to three other towns and an entire district of Armenia,
whose population is 3.4 million.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev told a news
briefing in Moscow Thursday that one man had been killed and 48
injured in clashes between Armenians and Azerbaijanis in
Nagorno-Karabakh, which has been part of Azerbaijan since 1923
despite its historical links to Armenia.
   The dead man was an Armenian, and as were 32 of the injured, he
said. The 16 others were Azerbaijani, Perfiliev said. More than 30
buildings had been burned down and there were beatings and looting,
he said.
   Tension heightened in Nagorno-Karabakh after a shoot-out Sunday
in the village of Khadzhaly near Stepanakert in which one man was
killed and at least 25 wounded.
   The campaign to annex Ngorno-Karabakh began in February and led
to ethnic rioting in the Azerbaijani city of Sumjait in which at
least 32 people were killed.

<HEAD>10 Accused of Defrauding Employee Benefit Plans</HEAD>

   Health care executives in several states
and a promoter have been charged with offering kickbacks in return
for lucrative employee-benefit contracts with businesses and labor
unions.
   ``Workers around the country are adding another dollar or two''
to their health premiums because of secret kickbacks, said Richard
Held, chief of the FBI office here.
   The indictments against 10 people and one Maryland-based health
benefit company, which include charges of racketeering,
embezzlement and falsifying records, were unsealed Thursday in San
Francisco, Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago and San Diego.
   Federal agents working undercover handled thousands of dollars
in kickbacks for securing health benefit contracts for companies
and labor unions during a three-year investigation, Justice
Department officials said.
   The kickbacks, collected by brokers and health plan
representatives, were in addition to commissions that legitimate
brokers charge for arranging contracts, the officials said.
   One of the indictments says an FBI agent was promised $7,500 a
month _ a rate of 75 cents for each employee at National
Semiconductor Inc. of Santa Clara, Calif. _ by brokers for securing
a health benefit contract. The money, which was never paid,
apparently would have been charged to the employer.
   Among those indicted were United HealthCare Inc. of Baltimore
and one of its executives, and the former benefit plan managers for
two Chicago-based labor unions.
   But the central figure in the case is Angelo Commito, 43, of
Fairfax, Calif., described as a middleman in the business of lining
up health benefit contracts for companies and unions. Authorities
said he was arrested Thursday in Palm Springs and released on $1
million bail.
   In the Atlanta indictments, Commito and five other people are
accused of conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud and money laundering
in a plan to defraud the Munford Corp., a retailing concern, and
its employee welfare plan in the selection of a second prepaid
optical program and an alcohol and drug abuse counseling program.
   The fraud allegedly involved using Commito's companies to pay
kickbacks to a government agent who posed as Munford's
representative for the purchase of the programs.
   Commito and another man also were accused of devising a scheme
to defraud the National Semiconductor Corp. of Santa Clara, Calif.,
of money the two allegedly agreed would be used to pay kickbacks to
a government undercover agent who posed as the company
representative. The kickbacks were to persuade the firm to buy an
alcohol and drug rehabilitation program.
   U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello of San Francisco called Commito
``a known associate of traditional organized crime individuals ...
members of the Aiuppa family of Chicago.''
   The charges against him include violating the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in schemes against four
benefit plans. The maximum sentence is 20 years in prison and a
$250,000 fine.
   At a news conference, Russoniello said certain types of health
benefits newly required by a number of states, such as drug and
alcohol rehabilitation, appeared to be particularly attractive
targets for corruption in the soliciting of benefit contracts.
   ``The amount of money that passes through this kind of program
has made it ripe for the plucking,'' the prosecutor said. ``It's
difficult to know how widespread, nationally, the abuse is.''
   He said the Justice Department would seek to consolidate all the
cases in San Francisco.
   Bill Slavin, president of United HealthCare, declared the firm
``innocent of all charges.'' Commito made no immediate comment on
the indictments.
   United, which provides prepaid optical, dental and medical
prescription services to more than a million families in 42 states,
is accused of taking part in the scheme to pay the government agent
who was soliciting an optical contract for employees of Munford.

   Rescuers aboard helicopters searched
for a missing British worker today and shipboard crews battled
flames from explosions and fire on a North Sea oil platform,
officials said.
   All the other 66 people on the semi-submersible platform Ocean
Odyssey escaped Thursday from the explosions and fire. Rescue
helicopters took them to this port city, and one was reported to
have suffered slight injuries.
   The rig is about 110 miles from where Occidental Petroleum's
semi-submersible oil rig Piper Alpha was swept by explosions and
fire on July 6, killing 167 people in the world's worst oil rig
disaster.
   Police identified the missing man in Thursday's accident as
25-year-old Timothy Williams, a radio operator. Rescuers resumed
their search for him at dawn today.
   Support ships today fought more flames as gas continued to well
up to the platform.
   The platform is owned by the New Orleans-based Ocean Drilling
and Exploration Co. and operated by the Atlantic Richfield Co. of
Los Angeles.
   William Waver, the owner's vice president, was quoted by the
London newspaper The Independent today as saying the two blasts and
fire apparently followed a buildup of gas pressure.
   Mud pumped into exploratory drilling pipes usually stops any
pocket of high pressure gas or oil from forcing its way to the
surface. So-called blow-outs occur when the pressure is too great
to be held back by the mud. Valves fitted to prevent blow-outs
sometimes fail.
   James Murphy, one of the 66 crewmen who escaped, told reporters
in Aberdeen that two explosions engulfed the platform in flames.
   Murphy, 42, an engineer on the platform, said crewmen had been
worried about the gas pressure for the past six weeks.

   Sidney Hicks thought he would never again
hear his blue-fronted Amazon parrot whistle the theme from the
``Andy Griffith Show.'' Then Arthur turned up in Texas.
   ``I`m just thrilled to death,'' said Hicks, who owns dozens of
parrots. ``I had just given up on it. I had reconciled myself to
the fact that I would never see him again.''
   The bird, valued at $1,000, was stolen in its cage July 1 from
the front porch of Hicks' home.
   The theft attracted widespread news coverage because of Arthur's
specialty _whistling the theme song from the ``Andy Griffith
Show,'' which featured George ``Goober'' Lindsey of Jasper.
   Police Sgt. Jeff Sparks said that 22-year-old Roger V. Hill,
arrested this week in an unrelated burglary, admitted taking the
parrot and giving it to relatives in Pasadena, Texas. An arrest
warrant charges Hill with first-degree theft in the parrot-napping.
   ``The people who had him didn't know anything about it being
stolen,'' Hicks said. ``They said he was whistling and talking and
in good shape.''

   Thomas Gossett calls it art, but city
officials objected that the nuts-and-bolts sculpture displayed in
front of his auto parts business was a bit too earthy.
   The stainless-steel sculpture is a seven-foot-tall ``male'' bolt
with arms and legs chasing a shorter, partially stooped ``female''
nut with her arms in the air.
   Officials in this Detroit suburb found in suggestive and
offensive, and forced Gossett to remove it from in front of his
Creative Metals Inc. business.
   ``It doesn't fall within the city's sign ordinance,'' said Mayor
Ronald Bonkowski. ``Our building department has received many calls
and letters about this, this object, for want of a better word. The
city suggested he remove it from in front of his business and he
did. We're happy about that.
   ``I've seen it, and it doesn't qualify as a sign. Is it art? Not
to me.''
   Gossett said he made the sculpture for a friend at least three
years ago but took it back when the friend received complaints for
displaying it.
   The sculpture stayed in Gossett's shop until a few weeks ago,
when he moved it out front to free some space. His attempts to
mollify complaints failed.
   ``I tried putting clothes on them. A skirt on the girl and a
shirt and pants for the guy,'' he said. ``Sunglasses for both of
them. The city said, `Nice try, but they've got to go.'''
   Back inside his shop, Gossett plans to separate the figures and
set them up playing volleyball or something equally inoffensive.
But he expresses a little disappointment with his critics.
   ``In the art world, take Picasso. I see something you don't
see,'' Gossett said. ``Every art object is different. People are
looking at this thing as a dirty porno thing. It's not.''

<TEXT>
   NASA has determined that the space
shuttle Discovery's boosters do not contain the old model of a
nozzle ring used inadvertently in the final test of the redesigned
booster.
   Engineers rechecked inventory paperwork and re-examined X-rays
before concluding that the twin rockets scheduled to help lift
Discovery into space Thursday contain the correct, improved nozzle
inlet rings, NASA spokesman Ed Medal said Thursday.
   He said early X-rays of Morton Thiokol's boosters were enhanced
by computer and confirmed that the boosters are ``in the right
configuration.''
   Even if the old-design rings had been found, it was unlikely it
would have delayed the launch because the old rings performed well
in previous shuttle flights and tests, said Medal, the space
agency's spokesman at the Marshall Space Flight Center in
Huntsville, Ala.
   Engineers discovered earlier this week during regular post-test
examination that the nozzle inlet ring installed in the Aug. 18
test booster contained the old design. Morton Thiokol said the old
ring performed satisfactorily.
   The rings are inside the nozzle assembly at the tail of the
126-foot-long shuttle booster. They are not the O-rings in the
booster segment joints that were blamed for the Jan. 28, 1986,
explosion of the shuttle Challenger.
   The nozzle inlet ring has been only slightly modified since
then, while the segment joints have been extensively redesigned.

   Officials are investigating why five
buses swept away by Hurricane Gilbert made a detour from their
planned route into a riverbed, putting them in the path of the
disaster in which at least 140 people died.
   At least 5,000 families remained in shelters throughout northern
Nuevo Leon state after last week's flash floods caused by Hurricane
Gilbert destroyed homes in the normally dry Santa Catarina riverbed
and near other flooded rivers, the government said Thursday.
   In a controversy dubbed by the local press as ``the detour to
death,'' state police said they were looking for reasons that the
five buses detoured from their planned route, only to be swept into
the raging waters Saturday morning.
   ``We're trying to understand why they were detoured there and
who was responsible,'' said Gilbert Sanchez of the state police.
   He said in a telephone interview that the buses that pass
through Monterrey to other parts of the country normally would have
been on a road nearly a mile from the riverbed.
   Transit police from Monterrey and neighboring San Pedro
apparently detoured the buses, but Sanchez said reports that they
were detoured because of a gas leak had not been confirmed.
   ``It's under investigation,'' he said. ``We're getting a lot of
versions.''
   The state government said in a news release that hundreds of
families living in the Sierra Madre Occidental surrounding this
state capital remained isolated because roads were cut by flooding.
   Hurricane Gilbert slammed into the Gulf of Mexico coast last
Friday, then tore inland until it met the 14,000-foot mountains
surrounding this metropolitan area of nearly 3 million people 190
miles inland.
   The normally dry Santa Catarina River that divides Monterrey
became a torrent of destruction, sweeping away homes, utility
towers and streets built in the riverbed.
   Although the squatter communities that have been growing for
decades in the riverbed were evacuated hours before the flood, many
people lost everything they owned.
   Gilbert killed more than 200 people in Mexico, Honduras, Haiti,
Jamaica and the Dominican Republic.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of well-wishers huddled under umbrellas
today at the Imperial Palace to pray in the rain for ailing Emperor
Hirohito, and thousands more signed get-well registries around
Japan.
   His condition remained stable, but he needed two more blood
transfusions after continued hemorrhaging, palace officials said
today. The 87-year-old emperor, the longest reigning monarch alive,
vomited blood Monday from intestinal hemorrhaging, and he has been
in bed ever since.
   Crown Prince Akihito, who took over imperial duties temporarily
on Thursday, today presided over a Palace ceremony attended by
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita to mark the autumnal equinox, a
national holiday.
   About 500 people with umbrellas and cameras lined up in front of
the Palace gates today and waited to take up calligraphy brushes
and put their names in a registry wishing the emperor a speedy
recovery. Some chanted Buddhist prayers.
   Palace officials said 23,000 people signed registries placed in
12 locations around the country Thursday. Today, officials were
setting up outdoor tents with more lists in front of other
government offices.
   One elderly visitor to the Palace wore a uniform of the Japanese
Imperial Army from the era of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05.
The man said it wasn't his, but he could find no other to wear.
   ``I felt I had to wear some kind of military uniform to come
before the emperor,'' he said.
   Under the constitution written during the post-World War II
occupation by U.S. forces, the emperor, who has ruled since 1926,
is only a symbol of the state with no real power.
   While highly popular with many Japanese, he is opposed by a
minority that views him as a remnant of the militarism that
dominated before and during World War II.
   Kenji Maeda, an official of the Imperial Household Agency that
runs Palace affairs, told reporters Thursday that Hirohito ate two
ice cubes that day and watched his favorite television serial.
   In Britain, tabloid newspapers renewed their attacks on Hirohito
today after Japan protested their negative coverage.
   The newspapers have called Hirohito evil and said he deserves to
go to hell for his acts during World War II.
   ``We cannot forget that in the name of Emperor Hirohito, the
Japanese army and navy launched a criminal attack on British
possessions in the Far East for no other reason than greed,'' the
London Sun quoted its unidentified spokesman as saying.
   In a letter published by The Sun, Japan's ambassador to Britain,
Kazuo Chiba, expressed ``astonishment and aversion that The Sun
should have carried an article such as this, which is so full of
ill will and which slanders a sovereign.''

   Officials have decided to rename a park
after an 8-year-old boy shot and killed by a woman who stormed into
an elementary school last spring.
   The Winnetka Park District board voted 5-2 Thursday to name
Edgewood Park after Nicholas Corwin.
   The child was killed when Laurie Dann entered the Hubbard Woods
School during a shooting rampage May 20, wounding four
second-graders and one other person before killing herself.
   Some people opposed the board's action, arguing the child's name
would remind children of the shooting and reopen wounds in the
village that are just now beginning to close.
   But one of the speakers at the board meeting, 9-year-old
Jennifer Covelle, made a simple plea for the park's new name.
   ``I don't know what the big deal is,'' she said. ``It doesn't
remind me of the shooting, it reminds me of Nicky.''

   The dollar was little changed in subdued European
trading early today as the market waited for the weekend meeting of
the seven leading industrialized democracies.
   Gold prices were higher in Europe, touching $400 an ounce in
Zurich.
   Dealers said they expected trading to remain calm because most
players would be unwilling to make aggressive moves before
Saturday's meeting in West Berlin of financial ministers from the
Group of Seven industrialized nations.
   Banks and financial markets in Japan were closed today for the
national Autumnal Equinox Day holiday. In London, the dollar was
quoted at 134.45 yen, unchanged from its closing rate in Tokyo
Thursday.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Thursday:
   _1.8773 West German marks, down from 1.8790
   _1.5857 Swiss francs, down from 1.5870
   _6.3855 French francs, down from 6.3955

   _$1.2197 Canadian, up from 1.2188
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.6675, unchanged
from Thursday's late rate.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $399.60 a troy ounce, up
from $397.75 bid late Thursday. At mid-morning today, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $399.30.
   In Zurich, the noon bid price was $400.00, up from $397.00 bid
late Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 70 cents to close at a bid
$401.72.
   Silver bullion was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.25 a

<BYLINE>Afghan Ambassador: Interim Government Unworkable Solution

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghanistan's ambassador to India said
today a U.N. envoy's proposal for an interim government in his
country was an unworkable solution.
   Ambassador Abdul Samad Azhar also repeated his government's
accusations that the United States and Pakistan were continuing to
supply arms to Afghan guerrillas fighting that country's
Soviet-backed government, which he called a violation of the April
14 Geneva Accord.
   The accord provided for the withdrawal of half of the Soviet
Union's more than 100,000 troops in Afghanistan by mid-August and
all of them by Feb. 15, 1989. U.N. observers and others say the
Soviets are complying with the pact.
   Diego Cordovez, the U.N. envoy who mediated the accord, has
proposed the creation of a broad-based interim government to
replace President Najib's government, which is dominated by the
People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan.
   ``The suggestion by Diego Cordovez _ it is against our
principle, (our) policy,'' Azhar told foreign and Indian reporters
at a news conference at the Afghan Embassy, just down the road from
the Soviet Embassy in New Delhi's diplomatic enclave.
   ``What are the assurances that such a government can remain in
power, because such a government will demolish the existing policy,
the existing defense, the existing security?'' Azhar asked. ``Then
what will be the power of such a transitional government in
Afghanistan? It has not any solid base.''
   When asked if his remarks meant that Cordovez's proposal was
unacceptable to the Afghan government, Azhar described his remarks
as a ``personal'' view. To date no Afghan official is believed to
have expressed a similar view.
   Cordovez, who has been working for a peaceful resolution of the
Afghan war since 1982, has proposed that a traditional tribal
council decide the country's future.
   He said he had compiled a list of 30 impartial, respected
Afghans who could help convene the council and possibly form an
interim government of peace and reconciliation.
   ``We believe a broad-based government should be proposed in
Afghanistan,'' Cordovez said Sept. 15. A former U.N.
secretary-general for political affairs, Cordovez is now foreign
minister of Ecuador but remains U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar's special representative on Afghanistan.
   Soviet troops intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979.

   Showers and thunderstorms stretched from northeastern Illinois
to western New York state today after drenching Michigan with up to
4 inches of rain, triggering a flash flood watch.
   Showers and thunderstorms also extended from the Texas Panhandle
and extreme western Oklahoma to southwest Texas. A few showers
lingered over central New Mexico.
   Skies were mostly cloudy from the southern Rockies to the
mid-Mississippi Valley and western New England, and over the
Pacific Northwest. Clear skies prevailed in the rest of the nation.
   Thunderstorms in lower Michigan on Thursday dropped up to 4
inches of rain on Grand Rapids and doused Battle Creek with 2
inches in two hours that night. The flash flood watch for southern
Michigan remained in effect early today.
   Showers and thunderstorms also moved over southern Wisconsin and
northern Illinois on Thursday evening. Strong winds downed trees in
suburbs southwest of Chicago, while Madison, Wis., received 1.37
inches of rain, breaking the precipitation record for the date of 1
inch, set in 1959.
   Showers and thunderstorms in west Texas on Thursday evening
generated strong winds that snapped power lines and blew the
awnings off buildings in Plainview. Winds gusted to 65 mph in
Crosby and 58 mph in Lubbock.
   The high temperature for the nation Thursday, the first day of
fall, was 97 degrees in Fort Smith, Ark., Lakeland, Fla., and
Wichita, Kan. It was the first day without a 100-degree reading
since May 30.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
along a cold front from New England to the Ohio Valley and the
Oklahoma Panhandle, with showers most numerous over eastern New
York state and New England; and cloudy to partly cloudy skies over
the upper Great Lakes and the upper Mississippi Valley.
   High temperatures were forecast to be in the 60s along sections
of the Pacific Coast, Washington state, northern Idaho, northwest
Montana, parts of the central Rockies, northern sections of the
upper Great Lakes and the upper Mississippi Valley and most of
Maine; in the 80s in California's inland valleys, southern New
Arizona, New Mexico and western Texas, and from central Oklahoma to
Kentucky and the Atlantic Coast from New Jersey to North Carolina;
in the 90s in the eastern two-thirds of Texas, the lower
Misssissippi Valley, the Gulf Coast, the southern Atlantic Coast,
Florida and the desert Southwest; and in the 70s in the rest of the
nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 33

   Leftist rebels attacked an army
post with mortars and catapult-launched dynamite, killing at least
15 soldiers in what appeared one of the most successful guerrilla
operations in recent months.
   Eleven guerrillas were killed and 11 soldiers were wounded in
the attack Thursday in eastern Morazan province, according to a
communique issued by the Armed Forces Press Office.
   The raid on the army post began an hour after guerrillas lifted
a road traffic ban that had paralyzed most transportation
nationwide since Monday. In lifting the ban, the rebels called on
supporters to step up sabotage of vehicles that had ignored the
measure.
   Marxist-led rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front have fought the the U.S.-backed centrist government for
nearly nine years. About 65,000 people, mostly civilians, have been
killed.
   Lt. Salvador Gonzalez said the attack began at 1 a.m. with
rebels firing mortar rounds and charges of TNT into a
communications post on Avocado Hill, north of Corinto, 120 miles
northeast of San Salvador.
   Gonzalez, spokesman for the 3rd Army Brigade, said the rebels
used catapults, similar to those used in medieval times, to launch
explosives into the base defended by about 50 men. The guerrillas
then attacked with rifle fire, he said.
   Gonzalez spoke by telephone from San Miguel, headquarters for
military operations in the eastern third of this small Central
American country.
   The guerrillas also stepped up their sabotage of power
transmission lines in several of El Salvador's 14 provinces.
   The rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos said the ban _ the
fifth this year _ was lifted at midnight Wednesday. Bus and truck
traffic returned to normal Thursday.
   At least three vehicles were burned during the ban, which
reduced bus and truck traffic in the capital by about 70 percent.
Traffic on provincial highways was almost completely halted.
   Some buses and trucks that operated since Monday covered their
license plates trying to avoid reprisals.
   The guerrillas blew up about 35 utility posts or high-tension
towers after the transport ban began, military sources said. Four
eastern provinces were without electricity early Thursday because
of overnight sabotage.

   Westerly breezes and atmospheric pressure zones in
the Caribbean may ultimately direct the course of Hurricane Helene
as it brings its 130 mph winds westward from the mid-Atlantic,
forecasters say.
   But if the season's fourth hurricane continues to strengthen it
could brush aside any weather systems in its path.
   ``Once a system reaches a certain level _ like Hurricane Gilbert
_ they are relatively unaffected by the atmosphere and weather they
encounter. They are just strong enough move the whole weather
around them,'' said Randy Lascody, a meteorologist at the National
Hurricane Center.
   Lascody said it will be at least until the weekend before
forecasters will be able to accurately predict the course of
Helene, which formed early Wednesday at 75 mph and increased to 130
mph winds today.
   On Saturday, Helene may be close enough to allow a
reconnaissance flight from Puerto Rico, said Lascody.
   ``Then we'll have some hard data to make a judgment about the
hurricane,'' he said.
   ``Everyone is pretty gun-shy now after Gilbert,'' said Lascody.
``Helene is a pretty strong hurricane but it's still far from
everything. It wouldn't be getting all this attention so soon if it
wasn't right after Gilbert.''
   Gilbert slammed into the Caribbean, northern Mexico and the
Texas Gulf Coast last week, killing hundreds and inflicting
billions of dollars worth of damage.
   At 6 a.m. EDT today, the center of the 250-mile wide storm was
at latitude 14.3 north and longitude 45.4 west, or about 950 miles
east of the Caribbean island of Barbados. Helene was moving
west-northwest at 10 mph and was expected to continue that course
and speed through Saturday, with a gradual turn to the northwest
thereafter.
   Its slow progress may give it time to draw more strength from
warm Atlantic waters.
   But air currents from a low-pressure trough over the ocean may
draw Helene northward into the open Atlantic, away from the
Caribbean islands and North America, said forecaster Miles Lawrence.
   Ocean storms become hurricanes when sustained winds reach a
minimum 74 mph. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to
Nov. 30.
   Two other hurricanes this season caused only minor damage in
Mexico and the U.S. Gulf Coast.

<HEAD>Bayh, Mutz Locked In A Bitter, Expensive Battle In Indiana</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG RICHARDSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A campaign of deep pockets and tit-for-tat
attacks is being waged in Indiana, where the son of former U.S.
Sen. Birch E. Bayh is trying to break the Republicans' 20-year hold
on the governor's office.
   The race between Republican Lt. Gov. John M. Mutz and
32-year-old Secretary of State Evan Bayh is shaping up as the most
expensive in Indiana history, a campaign fought through
point-counterpoint TV commercials.
   Mutz, 52, in recent weeks has questioned Bayh's integrity,
charging the Democrat plays fast and loose with the facts about his
own record.
   Bayh this week claimed the Mutz campaign ``stooped to a new
low'' in Indiana politics by engaging in character assassination.
He contended the attacks are prompted by poll results that show him
leading by six to 10 points.
   ``It's not easy being behind,'' said Bayh. ``It's a very
pressure-filled situation. ... I think there's probably a good deal
of frustration and pressure'' in the Mutz campaign.
   Neither side has disclosed how much it has raised or spent, and
the latest finance reports are not due until early October, but
Mutz's campaign hopes to raise $3.5 million and the Bayh campaign
expects more than $2 million.
   That could eclipse the previous Indiana spending record set in
1980 when Bayh's father and Dan Quayle, the current GOP vice
presidential nominee, spent a total of almost $5 million as Quayle
upset the three-term incumbent.
   Bayh could become Indiana's youngest governor this century.
Robert Orr, who at 70 is the nation's second-oldest governor, is
barred from a third four-year term. Indiana's last Democratic
governor was Roger Branigin, elected in 1964.
   The GOP has made an issue of Bayh's age and inexperience _ two
years as secretary of state to Mutz's 21 in public service _ and
tried to counter his famous name, running a commercial with the
line ``Experience is earned, not inherited.''
   The elder Bayh has raised money behind the scenes and makes
occasional appearances in his son's place. Some of Evan Bayh's top
campaign aides worked for his father.
   Indiana's high court earlier this year rejected a GOP attempt to
have Bayh declared ineligible to run under the constitution's
five-year residency rule. Bayh returned to Indiana in 1984 after
working as a lawyer in Washington.
   Bayh, in TV commercials, claimed to have led a fight to return
the profits from the state motor vehicle license branch to the
people, refused a raise and cut his office budget by 10 percent.
   Mutz countered that it was Orr who pushed through legislation
transferring the license branch from political to state control,
that there never was a final bill in the Legislature offering Bayh
a raise, and that Bayh spent more money in his first year in office
than his GOP predecessor did in his last year.
   The Mutz counterattack on television ends with the line, ``It's
a question of integrity.''
   Bayh stood by his claims and charged that Mutz favored the old
license system, took a 50 percent raise in 1985 and presided over
threefold growth in his office budget.
   A last-minute advertising blitz helped Bayh defeat Republican
Robert O. Bowen, son of former governor and current Health and
Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen, for secretary of state two
years ago.
   ``If he thinks that he can continue to portray half-truths and
partial truths and innuendo as he did in '86 and is doing now in
his television commercials, we just will not let him get away with
that,'' said Mutz.

   Blind masseurs rapped police with their
walking sticks as hundreds rallied today to demand government
action against their sighted colleagues.
   The 400 blind demonstrators, who were driven to the law-making
Legislative Yuan in Taipei by friends, tried to enter the building.
   But police blocked the blind protesters, and some hit the
officers with their walking sticks. Police pushed them away.
   The protesters dispersed when lawmakers pledged to review their
complaints.
   Kuo Kun-hsiung, leader of the demonstration, complained that
many massage parlors employ young girls as masseuses. He said the
practice violates a law that says only blind people can work in the
business to protect the welfare of the disabled.
   Several thousand of the estimated 10,000 blind people in Taiwan
work as masseurs.

<HEAD>U.S. Confirms That Black Fugitive Was Turned Away From Consulate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials today said they
turned away a black fugitive who sought to join four escaped
activists taking refuge at the U.S. Consulate.
   The 22-year-old man, identified as Max Mankazana, later was
taken into custody by South African police, according to his father.
   Barry Walkley, a U.S. Embassy spokesman, said the man appeared
at the consulate about 3 a.m. Thursday and appealed for refuge.
   ``While we have deep compassion for the conditions involved, it
was clear to all parties that the situation did not correspond to
that of the others granted temporary refuge,'' Walkley said. ``The
person voluntarily left the area.''
   Three of South Africa's most prominent anti-apartheid activists
have been encamped at the consulate since Sept. 13, when they
slipped away from guards while undergoing therapy at a hospital.
All three had been detained without charge for more than a year.
   On Wednesday, a fourth activist, Clifford Ngcobo, joined them
after a similar escape.
   The four were to be visited today by Anglican Archbishop Desmond
Tutu.
   Walkley did not specify why the United States viewed Mankazana's
case differently from the others. Police have not said why they
were pursuing the young man, but he had not been in detention,
unlike the other four, who are known political activists.
   Ngcobo, 30, said in a court affidavit that he was assaulted by
police when he was detained April 23, his lawyers said. They said
he was to be examined soon by doctors.
   Ngcobo told the liberal Weekly Mail newspaper he was beaten and
urinated blood for weeks after the alleged assault. The Weekly Mail
said its reporter spoke to Ngcobo at Johannesburg Hospital only
hours before he escaped.
   South African authorities on Thursday issued, then later
withdrew, an arrest warrant for Ngcobo. He has not been charged
with any crime.
   The government has said it will not act against the three
activists who escaped to the consulate last week.
   They are Murphy Morobe and Mohammed Valli Moosa, leaders of the
banned United Democratic Front, the country's largest
anti-apartheid coalition, and Vusi Khanyile, chairman of the banned
National education Crisis Committee.
   The three have called for the release of all political detainees
and have refused to leave the consulate despite the government
assurances.
   U.S. officials say the activists will not be expelled from the
consulate, despite a worldwide policy of not granting asylum in
U.S. diplomatic missions.
   In another development, Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said
seven people had been arrested in connection with the bombing
Wednesday of the main white bus terminal in Johannesburg that
injured 19 people.
   Vlok did not identify the seven, but said they were members of
the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement, which
seeks to oust the white-led government.
   Police also blamed the ANC for a pre-dawn bombing Thursday at a
Johannesburg disco that injured 19 blacks. Police offered no
explanation as to why the ANC would target a club frequently almost
exclusively by blacks.

<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha and the U.N.
chief agreed today that independence plans for South-West Africa
are on track, but Botha said the Cuban presence in Angola threatens
a regional peace settlement.
   Botha and U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, who
met for an hour, discussed peace plans for the protracted guerrilla
wars in Angola and South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.
   Perez de Cuellar said the meeting left him ``with a feeling of
relief.''
   ``We are moving forward in a very serious, very effective manner
to implement (U.N.) Resolution 435,'' he said. The resolution
establishes the process leading to Namibian independence.
   ``I think the implementation is closer than ever,'' he added.
   Perez de Cuellar was to fly this afternoon to Angola for talks
with the country's Marxist leaders, who are supported by more than
50,000 Cuban troops.
   Botha said he and Perez de Cuellar agreed on all matters related
to Namibian independence. But Botha added: ``There is a problem.
That is the presence of the Cubans. As soon as we solve that
problem, we will solve the others more easily.'
   South Africa has ruled Namibia _ Africa's last colony _ for 73
years. The United Nations has passed repeated resolutions calling
for independence in the territory.
   South Africa has agreed to end its rule over Namibia and allow
U.N. observers to oversee the transition to independence, but only
if the estimated 50,000 Cuban troops in neighboring Angola withdraw.
   Cuba has agreed in principle to withdraw its troops, but there
is dispute over the timetable. South Africa wants the Cubans out by
June 1, the date it has offered to relinquish control over Namibia.
   The Cubans, meanwhile, reportedly are seeking at least a
two-year period during which to withdraw.
   U.S.-mediated talks involving Angola, Cuba and South Africa,
aimed at setting this timetable, are to resume Monday in
Brazzaville, Congo.
   Perez de Cuellar said he did not feel it was proper for him to
speak to the Cubans about withdrawing from Angola or to get
involved in the Brazzaville talks.
   Botha raised the issue of the Cuban withdrawal at today's
meeting, but gave no public indication he was disappointed by Perez
de Cuellar's reluctance to get more directly involved.
   Botha said South Africa had given approval for a U.N. team to
visit Namibia to assess the tasks that would face a U.N. observer
force.

   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres left today for a
meeting with President Reagan on Middle East peace and said Israel
would not negotiate with Palestinians who ``shoot, throw stones or
threaten with terror.''
   Peres' comments came one day after widespread clashes between
Israeli troops and Palestinian rioters in the occupied territories
left 24 Palestinians wounded, according to Arab hospital officials.
   Since the Palestinian uprising began in the occupied lands on
Dec. 8, Israeli soldiers have killed 270 Palestinians. Six Israelis
have died.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin escaped injury Thursday during a
tour of the Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis when a Palestinian
assailant hurled a chunk of cement from a nearby rooftop. Soldiers
rushed to the site but made no arrests.
   Peres is to meet Monday in New York with Reagan and Foreign
Minister Esmat Abdel Meguid of Egypt.
   The meeting, called by Reagan, caused a political storm in
Israel, where Peres' left-leaning Labor Party and Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc are the two main rivals in
parliamentary elections set for Nov. 1.
   Shamir accused Peres of engineering the session to advance his
party's chances and said such a meeting before the election could
not possibly advance the peace process.
   But Peres said at the airport today the meeting ``has
considerable power to push the peace process forward at a level we
have not seen since the Camp David accords,'' when Israel signed a
peace treaty with Egypt in 1979.
   Peres also said Israel would not negotiate with the Palestine
Liberation Organization or any other Palestinian group that does
not recognize Israel and renounce violence.
   ``Israel will not talk to people who shoot, throw stones or
threaten with terror,'' he said. ``Any state which would like to
participate in the peace process would contribute to peace by
establishing full relations with Israel.''
   Peres, who will make a stopover in Paris, is scheduled to meet
with President Francois Mitterrand and Foreign Minister Roland
Dumas, who will report to Peres on talks last week with PLO chief
Yasser Arafat.
   Peres criticized Dumas for meeting with Arafat. The two met in
Strasbourg, France, where Arafat addressed Socialist members of the
European Parliament last week.
   In another development today, army doctors began vaccinating the
nation's active and reserve duty soldiers in an effort to combat an
outbreak of polio, Health Ministry and army officials said.
   Some police will also receive the vaccine, army radio said.
   Nine polio cases have been confirmed so far in the outbreak,
which took Israeli officials by surprise. The daily Haaretz said
one victim was a 21-year-old soldier from Akko on the northern
Israeli coast.
   On Thursday, the army said four soldiers would face trial in the
beating death of an elderly Palestinian man, Khader al Tarazi, in
Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp.
   Israel radio said the troops were to be charged with
manslaughter for striking the man with clubs after they broke into
his home Aug. 22 to arrest Palestinian youths suspected of throwing
stones.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus on Thursday, Israeli troops shot
and wounded 16 Palestinians who attacked them with rocks and axes,
Arab hospital officials said. The officials said four other
Palestinians were wounded in clashes in villages near Nablus.
   Hospital officials in the Gaza Strip said four were wounded
there in clashes with troops Thursday, including a 13-year-old boy
who was shot in the chest and rushed to Tel Aviv's Tel Hashomer
hospital in serious condition.
   The army said only 11 Palestinians were wounded in Nablus and
nearby Burka village and three in Gaza.
   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip
from Egypt during the 1967 Middle East war.

   Orders for ``big ticket'' durable goods soared
6.0 percent in August on the strength of big jumps in the military
and transportation sectors, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said total orders jumped to a seasonally
adjusted $123.1 billion last month. The big jump follows a huge 7.4
percent decline in July, the biggest in more than four years, and
an 8.7 percent increase in June, which was the largest in 30 months.
   Orders for transportation equipment in August were up by 20.9
percent to $35.4 billion. More than half the increase was for motor
vehicles and parts. Auto orders had been weak in July as factories
were switching over to a new model year.
   That follows a 22.4 percent plunge in July and a 33.3 percent
gain in June. The transportation category has been buffeted back
and forth in recent months by big swings in orders for aircraft,
ships and tanks.
   Orders for defense goods jumped 15.3 percent in August to $8.1
billion, following a 49.4 percent drop in July and a 68.3 percent
increase in June. This category, which is also very volatile from
month to month, overlaps transportation and includes military
planes, tanks and ships.
   Excluding defense goods, orders rose 5.4 percent last month
following a decline of 2.2 percent in July and an increase of 4.2
percent in June.
   Excluding transportation, orders rose 1.0 percent in August,
fell 0.9 percent in July and rose 0.7 percent in June.
   Orders in the key category of non-defense capital goods, a good
barometer of business expansion plans, were up 5.4 percent in
August to $38.2 billion, following gains of 2.2 percent in July and
12.5 percent in June. This has been one of the strongest areas of
the economy as manufacturers gear up to meet a boom in export sales.
   Orders for primary metals such as steel fell 1.6 percent in
August, following small declines in July and June.
   Orders for the machinery category which includes computers rose
4.2 percent in August after falling 2.9 percent a month earlier.
Other kinds of electrical machinery were off 0.4 percent after a
3.2 percent gain in July.
   Shipments of durable goods rose 4.4 percent in August to $118.2
billion following a 2.9 percent drop in July.

<HEAD>West German Minister Rejects Call For Debt Forgiveness</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with West German finance minister
rejecting call for debt forgiveness. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The West German finance minister today rejected
even partial debt forgiveness for heavily indebted, middle-income
countries, despite the urging of the head of the International
Monetary Fund.
   But the minister, Gerhard Stoltenberg, also said he expected
that other major nations would join West Germany in reducing
interest rates on the massive debts owed by some poorer countries.
   ``There is no cause to discuss debt forgiveness'' for the
middle-income countries, Stoltenberg told reporters on the second
day of discussions leading up to the formal annual joint meetings
of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund next week.
   Countries whose people have average incomes above $750 a year
are considered middle-income countries. Brazil is the most heavily
indebted of these, owing $121 billion, followed by Mexico and
Argentina. The World Bank says the Third World debt burden at the
end of 1987 was $1.2 trillion.
   On Thursday, Michael Camdessus, chief of the International
Monetary Fund, urged industrial nations to write off some debts of
developing countries for the good of both groups. ``There is no
prosperity for the industrial countries without prosperity for the
developing countries,'' Camdessus told reporters.
   Camdessus spoke at the opening of international banking talks as
thousands of police patrolled West Berlin to prevent violence
during demonstrations planned by bank critics. They charge that
Third World countries are crushed under the weight of their debt to
wealthier nations.
   Fears of violence grew Tuesday when two masked men armed with at
least one shotgun fired at Hans Tietmeyer. The shots missed the
official of the West German Finance Ministry who helped plan the
international banking talks.
   Stoltenberg also said he opposes any suggestions for a worldwide
debt forgiveness. ``Calls for a global solution destroy the
creditworthiness of debtor countries,'' Stoltenberg said.
   He said debt problems should be solved on a case-by-case basis
and West Germany would rather restructure debt and improve
conditions than forgive loans. The West German government this week
announced additional concessions to the poorest countries. ``We
have verbal indications that the British and French governments
will make similar decisions,'' he said.
   Stoltenberg also said major industrial nations such as the
United States should strive for a closer alignment of their
economic policies, and that he wants to avoid ``strong swings in
foreign exchange rates.''
   The West German finance minister said he met Thursday with the
new U.S. treasury secretary, Nicholas Brady. He declined to go into
details on the talks, but said he expected U.S. economic policies
to remain unchanged.
   Stoltenberg is scheduled to meet with Brady and the top finance
officials from the five other major Western industrialized nations
on Saturday.
   Finance ministers from 24 developing countries are slated to
meet as well on Saturday and are expected to seek more aid from
governments as well as from commercial banks. They are also seeking
a cancellation of some debts.
   Delegates from the 151 World Bank and IMF member countries as
well as representatives of banking and industry have been arriving
all week for the West Berlin discussions.
   The talks culminate with the Sept. 27-29 joint meeting of the
two sister organizations, which lend money to governments for
development projects.

<HEAD>Chinese Government Offers Talks With Dalai Lama</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chinese government has offered to
hold direct, conditional talks with the exiled Tibetan leader, the
Dalai Lama, at a venue of his choice, the Chinese said in a
statement released in New Delhi today.
   The message was conveyed to the Dalai Lama on Wednesday through
his representative in the Indian capital, a senior Chinese diplomat
said.
   The Buddhist leader has lived in exile in Dharamsala, 300 miles
north of New Delhi in Himachal Pradesh state, since he fled Tibet
in 1959.
   Tsering Tashi, spokesman for the Dalai Lama in Delhi, said the
exiled leader ``has received the invitation for talks and is
deliberating with his advisers on a response.''
   The statement, issued by the Chinese Embassy, offered to hold
talks ``in Beijing, Hong Kong or any of our embassies or consulates
abroad. If the Dalai Lama finds it inconvenient to conduct talks at
these places, he may choose any place he wishes.''
   The Chinese diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
it was the first time his government has given the Dalai Lama a
choice of venues.
   The Chinese condition for talking with the leader of the
Tibetans is that, ``no foreigners should be involved,'' the
statement said.
   The statement said the proposals suggested by the Dalai Lama in
Strasbourg, France, in June ``cannot be considered as the basis for
talks with the (Chinese) central government because it has not at
all relinquished the concept of ``the independence of Tibet.'''
   In a speech delivered to the European Parliament at Strasbourg,
the Dalai Lama asked for ``a self-governing democratic, political
entity'' in Tibet ``in association with the People's Republic of
China.''
   In that speech, the exiled leader for the first time recognized
China's right to handle Tibet's foreign policy and maintain troops
on Tibetan soil.
   The Chinese government statement urged the Dalai Lama to give up
ideas of Tibetan independence.
   ``If the Dalai Lama is ... really concerned for the happiness of
the Tibetan people, for the economic development and prosperity of
the Tibetan nationality, he should truly give up the idea of the
independence of Tibet.''
   Tibetan activists seeking independence have rioted in Lhasa at
least twice in the past year. In March, up to 24 people died in the
province's capital as monks and civilians fought Chinese security
forces. Similar riots in September and October 1987 left 14 people
dead.

   An unemployed beautician bent on killing
``everybody I see'' shot to death an auto parts store owner and its
manager, a school custodian and a policewoman before a wounded
officer struggled to his feet and killed the gunman.
   Clemie Henderson, described by friends and relatives as a man
who had been emotionally disturbed since serving in Vietnam, died
Thursday as he stalked a West Side school near the store.
   ``He's a genuine hero,'' police Superintendent LeRoy Martin said
of Officer Greg Jaglowski, the 14-year police veteran who put an
end to the rampage.
   Henderson, 40, had been charged at least nine times between 1971
and last month for such offenses as battery, marijuana possession
and disorderly conduct, Martin said.
   Family members said Henderson had been on medication for a
psychiatric illness he developed in Vietnam, the Chicago Tribune
reported today.
   Edward Wodnicki, the chief of detectives, said police found
medication for depression in Henderson's home. Relatives said
Henderson had stopped taking the medication and was experiencing
difficulties as a result.
   ``People ... knew about him. He was always in trouble,''
Wodnicki said.
   Armed with a .38-caliber revolver and nearly three dozen rounds
of ammunition, Henderson walked into the Comet Auto Parts store
Thursday morning and opened fire, Martin said.
   The store's owner, John Van Dyke, 41, and manager, Robert Quinn,
26, were killed. Henderson missed a third worker, who pretended to
be hit and fell to the ground.
   The Rev. Clement Ferguson, pastor of nearby St. Stephenson's
Missionary Baptist Church, said he heard the shots and ran into the
store. He said he saw Henderson, whom he knew, leaving.
   ``I said, `What are you doing?' He said, `Reverend, don't nobody
say anything. I'm going to kill everybody I see.'''
   Henderson fled out a side entrance and shot a city garbage
collector, Laplose Chestnut Jr., 34, in the hand as he headed
toward the school across the street. Chestnut was in fair condition
today at Cook County Hospital, said spokeswoman Wanda Robertson.
   Minutes later, Henderson shot and killed Arthur Baker, 33, a
custodian at Moses Montefiore Public School, a school for troubled
boys, before the gunman encountered Officer Irma Ruiz, 40, and
Jaglowski, 38, at the door. The two officers had been called to the
school to deal with an unruly student.
   Henderson shot Mrs. Ruiz in the chest and wounded Jaglowski,
then went into a room to reload his revolver, police said. But
Jaglowski went inside after the gunman, killing Henderson in an
exchange of gunfire.
   Jaglowski was in fair condition today at Mount Sinai Hospital, a
spokesman said. Mrs. Ruiz, a mother of four and a 12-year police
veteran, was only the second female police officer killed in the
line of duty in Chicago, police said.
   The 135 students at the school were in classes and none was
injured during the shooting, said Principal Bernard Karlin.
   Martin said witnesses told him Henderson ``never said a word''
before opening fire.
   Henderson, who served as an Army combat infantryman in Vietnam,
lived in the neighborhood and had been unemployed for two years,
said David Finke, a friend of Henderson's and chairman of the
Midwest Committee for Military Counseling, a Chicago agency.
   ``I think it is fair to say he carried his disturbance from the
Vietnam era into the present,'' Finke said. ``I think Clem had a
great deal of anger. I always sensed he was working very hard to be
under control.''
   He said Henderson, a cosmetologist, had worked as a teacher for
Selan's Beauty School until he quit about two years ago,
complaining of being ``burned out.''
   In October 1985, Henderson was shot in the head, his brother
Roger Henderson said. Records at Cook County Hospital show he shot
himself, police said. But Henderson's brother said he was mugged by
two assailants.
   After a long hospital stay, Henderson returned to work at the
beauty school but began suffering seizures, said Jack Seramur, vice
president of the school.
   ``Finally, the medication got to be such that he could no longer
function and be employable,'' Seramur said.
   Finke said Henderson had three children by a first marriage and
had remarried, but separated in July from his second wife.
   Thursday's shooting was the second mass shooting in the Chicago
area in four months. On May 20, Laurie Dann opened fire in an
elementary school in the affluent suburb of Winnetka, killing an
8-year-old student and wounding six other people before taking her
own life.
   ``Had my two officers not been in the school ... I'm afraid we
would have had another incident such as what occurred in the north
suburbs,'' Martin said.
   As in the Dann case, Henderson possessed a valid Illinois
Firearm Owners Identification card, said state police spokesman Bob
Fletcher.

<HEAD>Sources: Indictment Requested In Italian Banking Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PIERO VALSECCHI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Judges investigating Italy's biggest postwar
banking scandal have asked for the indictment of financier Carlo De
Benedetti in connection with the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano,
court officials said today.
   The case of De Benedetti, who has been under investigation for
14 months over the sale of his shares in Banco Ambrosiano just
before it went bankrupt in 1982, also has links with the Institute
for Religious Works, the Vatican bank.
   The Vatican bank was the largest shareholder of Banco
Ambrosiano, which collapsed following the failed repayment of $1.3
billion in Vatican-bank assured loans made to 10 dummy corporations
set up in Latin America.
   Court officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, denied to
specify the charge or charges that De Benedetti faces, other than
to indicate it could include at least one count of extortion.
   GianDomenico Pisapia, De Benedetti's lawyer, said in a statement
there are no grounds for extortion charges against his client.
   Milan judges have been investigating whether De Benedetti
profitted illegally from his investment in the bank once headed by
Roberto Calvi. Calvi's body was found hanging from a London bridge
in June 1982.
   De Benedetti invested $37.1 million for a 2 percent stake in
Banco Ambrosiano before he was appointed deputy chairman of the
bank. He sold the stake when he resigned 65 days later, citing
disagreements with chairman Calvi.
   Court sources indicated De Benedetti is suspected of having
threatened to reveal irregularities in Banco Ambrosiano's
operations.
   If tried and convicted of extortion, De Benedetti could face a
prison sentence of up to 13 years.
   Investigators have asked for indictments, for alleged illegal
financial operations connected with the Ambrosiano case, of
ex-financier Anna Bonomi-Bolchini and Angelo Rizzoli, former
chairman-owner of the Rizzoli publishing group.
   Two Milan judges charged three top-ranking Vatican officials as
being accessories to fraudulent bankruptcy in the bank collapse,
but Italy's highest court last year ruled no action could be taken
against citizens of the Vatican, an independent city-state.
   The Vatican officials are U.S. Archbishop Paul C. Marcinkus,
chairman of the Vatican bank, and two senior executives of the
institute.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The new military government
announced the retirements or discharges of 29 officers in an effort
to appease rebellious soldiers on a purge of repressive commanders.
   The troops continued to hunt henchmen of the deposed Duvalier
dynasty Thursday but slowed down their campaign to remove hated
commanders, independent radio reports said.
   The military government headed by Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril
appealed for an end to a surge of lawlessness since Saturday's
coup, but even a government spokesman acknowledged Avril's tenuous
hold on the government.
   ``Formal instructions have been passed on to the forces of order
to arrest all individuals commiting acts of brigandage and
pillaging,'' said a military statement read on state television
late Thursday. It said violators would be ``duly tried and
punished.''
   Sporadic gunfire continued through the night and there were
continued reports of reprisal attacks. But for the most part the
capital was calm Thursday.
   Avril, a former army adjutant, assumed the presidency after
non-commissioned officers and other lower ranking enlisted men rose
up against Gen. Henri Namphy and sent him into exile in the
neighboring Dominican Republic.
   Since then, rank-and-file soldiers throughout the country have
revolted against their commanders, despositing a few of them
handcuffed outside the army headquarters in Port-au-Prince, the
capital.
   Radio Haiti Inter reported the ouster Thursday of two more
commanders, in the southwestern town of Cotes de Fer and the
northern port of St. Marc, bringing to 21 the number of commanders
who served under Namphy known to have been forcibly removed.
   It was unclear whether the 21 commanders were included in the 29
officers referred to in the army's later communique.
   The commander of the 40-man St. Marc barracks, Capt. Ernst
Ravix, a suspected Macoute sympathizer, was ousted by troops a day
after soldiers in the city fired on a crowd of demonstrators,
killing a 12-year-old boy and wounding three other people. The
Cotes de Fer commanders were not identified.
   The radio said that after Radix was arrested and brought to
Port-au-Prince, soldiers launched a hunt for the Tonton Macoutes,
who have long terrorized the local population.
   The Tonton Macoutes were the private henchmen of President
Jean-Claude Duvalier, who was forced into exile in February 1986.
   Bernard Degraff, the government's assistant director of
information, said the removal of unpopular officers now was
proceeding peacefully, indicating the soldiers had the tacit
support of the government.
   ``The ouster movement should cease very soon,'' he said,
acknowledging that ``loss of control of the situation is still
possible.''
   Namphy's country retreat in Foret des Pins outside
Port-au-Prince was among the homes reported pillaged.
   The Roman Catholic Church's Radio Soliel broadcast an interview
with an unidentified corporal who appealed to soldiers to stop
firing their weapons into the air because it was hampering the
search for Tonton Macoutes, who sometimes fire weapons
indiscriminately.
   Radio Metropole, meanwhile, said staff at the army general
headquarters issued a 16-point declaration, setting out their
objectives for elections, higher pay, medical benefits, subsidized
housing and commissary privileges.
   It appeared the unit was speaking for itself, although their
demands reflected sentiments expressed earlier by non-commissioned
officers and other enlisted men who carried out the coup.
   A demonstration scheduled for Thursday by political groups
supporting the soldier's revolt was canceled after soldiers said
they could not ensure the safety of the participants.

<HEAD>Advocates Call for More Federal Low-Income Housing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hollywood celebrities, members of Congress and
advocates for the homeless called for more federal low-income
housing money Thursday at the grand opening of a model shelter for
the homeless in the nation's capital.
   ``As nice as this place is, it ain't home,'' said Mitch Snyder,
director of the Federal City Shelter, which is located a half-mile
from the Capitol. ``To have people living in the streets, eating
out of garbage pails is an absolute obscenity. We need housing.''
   Snyder also announced that he and eleven other homeless
advocates from around the country are starting a 48-day hunger
strike to draw attention to the need for low-income housing.
   Snyder used a 51-day hunger strike during the 1984 presidential
campaign to persuade President Reagan to commit federal funds for
the shelter's renovation, then staged a 32-day fast in 1985 when
the administration initially withheld $5 million.
   Others echoed Snyder's call for more money for low-income
housing.
   ``The federal government has to keep its housing promise,'' said
actor Martin Sheen, who played Snyder in a made-for-TV movie called
``The Samaritan.'' ``This is just a stop-gap. What these people
need is houses, apartments they can afford to live in.''
   The housing issue, said Rep. Joe Kennedy, D-Mass., ``is where I
think we will see the major difference between a Republican and
Democratic administration next year.''

   U.S. Rep. Mike Synar chased and tackled a
man who allegedly stole a pair of gold cuff links from his
Washington, D.C., home on Thursday.
   A man who refused to give his name was jailed, police said.
   Synar, 37, said he returned home shortly after dawn from jogging
to find a burglar in his house.
   ``I was standing outside my house screaming, `Call 911, call
911!' I looked like Richard Dreyfuss in the movie `Down and Out in
Beverly Hills,''' Synar told The Tulsa Tribune's Washington bureau.
   Synar said he saw the man open a second-story bedroom window and
hop out. He then ``went over one fence in my neighbor's yard, and
then went over another fence in my neighbor's yard.''
   Synar said he shouted for help from a young man on the street.
   ``We followed him through yards and alleys,'' and grabbed the
man about three blocks from his house, Synar said. ``I knocked him
down. I had his hands pinned and then the cops came and we got

<HEAD>US Official Urges Further Immediate Aid To Flood-ravaged
Bangladesh</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. aid official back from viewing flood
damage in Bangladesh is urging that the United States provide
further aid and health supplies to victims in that country,
officials said Thursday.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters that
the principal recommendation of Jay F. Morris, deputy administrator
of the Agency for International Development, was for immediate
additional food aid.
   Redman said Morris also urged providing more health supplies to
combat waterborn diarrheal diseases.
   ``On a long-term basis, the report calls for support for a
multilateral effort to identify and resolve on a regional basis the
long-term causes of flooding in Bangladesh,'' he said.
   Morris made his recommendations in a report to President Reagan,
said AID spokesman John Metelsky.
   The United States already has provided $151 million worth of aid
to the flood victims, including 10,000 metric tons of wheat and
seeds to replant destroyed crops, Metelsky said.
   He said the United States also had sent 2.8 million packets of
oral-rehydration tablets to keep chidren from dying from diarrhea,
10 million water-purification tablets and other medical supplies.

<HEAD>President Signs Bill Easing Gas Controls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WACO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan signed into law Thursday a
bill repealing some restrictions on the sale of natural gas.
   Those curbs on such sales had been imposed under provisions of
the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.
   The bill repeals a requirement that the duration for any
contract representing an initial sale of new Outer Continental
Shelf natural gas be at least 15 years.
   It also does away with a requirement that producers of certain
decontrolled natural gas offer existing purchasers of their product
a right of first refusal when the producer receives another offer
for the gas.
   ``With the support of the Reagan administration and Vice
President George Bush's administration task force on regulatory
relief, the legislation passed Congress with substantial support,''
the White House press office said in a statement as Reagan arrived
here to make a political speech.
   The press office said Reagan had signed the bill on Air Force
One en route here from Washington.
   The statement said that repeal of certain anti-competitive
elements of the 1978 energy act ``will increase the flexibility of
natural gas producers and purchasers to enter into agreements that
accurately reflect market conditions.''
   ``It will also benefit consumers by increasing the
responsiveness of interstate gas prices to a more competitive
market,'' it said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission said Thursday it
will consider easing the rules covering purchases of 10 percent or
less of the stock of a business.
   Currently, federal regulations require that individuals or
businesses planning certain types or mergers or business
acquisitions inform the FTC and the Justice Department in advance
and then wait a specified time before completing the purchase.
   The aim of the rules is to give the two agencies a chance to
block mergers that violate antitrust laws.
   The FTC said it is considering three possible changes in its
rules and is seeking comment from businesses and others interested
in the topic. Any final decision on the matter would also require
agreement of the Justice Department.
   Possible changes include:
   _ Exempting purchases of 10 percent or less of a firm's voting
stock from the notification requirement, on the ground that such
acquisitions are unlikely to violate antitrust laws.
   _ Permitting such purchases, but requiring that the stock be
placed in escrow pending review by the FTC or Justice Department.
   _ Continuing to demand that the potential purchaser notify the
federal agencies, but not requiring it to tell the target company
of its plans.

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armored cars stood at the ready and an army of
police officers guarded West Berlin Thursday as the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund opened their annual meetings.
   Thousands of protesters were expected to protest what they call
unfair treatment of developing lands by the industrial nations.
   ``My city has become a fortress,'' said a taxi driver, who would
not give his name.
   At about noon an estimated 120 people, some carrying banners,
marched peacefully to protest IMF loans for projects that they said
harm the environment in Third World countries.
   Delegates from the 151 member countries as well as
representatives of banking and industry have been arriving all week
for the talks, which are expected to last a week.
   Leftist militants last Tuesday fired a shotgun at a West German
Finance Ministry official in Bonn, and authorities fear violence
could erupt in the streets of West Berlin.
   A leading West Berlin politician on Wednesday urged organizers
of a massive demonstration planned for Sunday to call off the
protest.
   ``Such a demonstration is in no way useful to the developing
lands,'' said Klaus Landowsky, general secretary of the Christian
Democratic Party of West Berlin.
   Several other protests are scheduled in West Berlin during the
financial talks, and demonstration organizers say they expect up to
40,000 participants.
   Landowsky said demonstration organizers would be culpable ``if
there are violent acts by criminal, autonomous circles'' linked to
the protests.
   Landowsky made the comments at a ceremony opening the first
round of World Bank-IMF talks.
   West Berlin's 6,000-strong police force has been reinforced with
about 2,700 police officers brought in from across West Germany.
   Thousands of green-jacketed police officers, carrying their
sidearms, patrolled the city streets. Armored cars could be seen
off the highway between Tegel Airport and downtown West Berlin.
   Thursday's march was organized by the German Federation for
Environment and the Protection of Nature, one of about 100 groups
planning protest actions during the World Bank-IMF talks.
   Protesters demanding not only that the World Bank and IMF cease
supporting projects that allegedly harm the environment, but also a
general debt forgiveness for those countries.
   According to World Bank figures, the total foreign debt of
developing nations will stand at $1.2 trillion by the end of this
year, an increase of about 4 percent from last year.
   At the sprawling International Congress Center, site of the
talks, delegates and journalists underwent lengthy security checks.
   They were asked to hand over their passports for examination,
empty the contents of their pockets onto a table, run their
portable computers and briefcases through an X-ray machine and walk
through an electronic metal-detector.

<TEXT>
   The federal budget posted a $23.08 billion
budget deficit in August, up almost 6 percent from a year ago, the
Treasury Department said Thursday.
   With only one month to go in the govenrment's fiscal year, the
deficit totals $165.3 billion through August.
   While that is higher than last year's deficit for the entire
year, the government is forecasting a surplus of around $13 billion
in September will narrow the gap between spending and revenues.
   The goverment is forecasting a budget deficit for all of fiscal
1988 of $152.35 billion, up 1.9 percent from the 1987 deficit of
$149.51 billion.
   This would be far better than many economists had been expecting
when the year began. At that time they foresaw a deficit of $160
billion or worse.
   Better-than-expected economic growth, which has boosted
government revenues and lowered spending for such programs as
unemployment beneifts, has been credited with reducing the deficit
this year.
   The administration is projecting a deficit next year, under
accounting guidelines contained in the Gramm-Rudman deficit
reduction law, of $140.1 billion for 1989, but private economists
believe the deficit will still hover around the $150 billion level.
   Last month's deficit of $23.08 billion was higher than the
deficit in August of 1987 of $21.8 billion and up slightly from an
imbalance of $22.94 billion this past July.
   In August, government spending totaled $92.56 billion while the
government took in $69.48 billion.
   As usual, the largest speding categories were the military,
Social Security and other programs in the Department of Health and
Human Services and interest on the national debt.
   Military spending totaled $23.8 billion in August and $260.89
billion for the first 11 months of the fiscal year, up 3.3 percent
from a year ago.
   Social Security payments totaled $18.2 billion last month and
$196.9 billion for the year, up 5.8 percent from a year ago.
Spending for other HHS programs, including Medicare, were $13.9
billion in August and $144.7 billion so far this year, up 5.5
percent from the same period a year ago.
   Interest payments on the $2.6 trillion national debt cost $15.3
billion in August and $198.9 billion for the year, up 9.6 percent
from a year ago.

<TEXT>
   The Michigan Supreme Court on Thursday let
stand an appeals court order allowing a pregnant woman to have an
abortion over the objections of her estranged husband.
   However, the justices extended until Monday a stay that has
prevented Shawn Lewis, 24, of Flint, from getting an abortion.
   A lawyer for the fetus's court-appointed guardian said he would
file pleadings Friday asking the U.S. Supreme Court to accept an
emergency appeal.
   ``I think the Michigan Court of Appeals is wrong,'' the
attorney, James Bopp Jr. said. ``What we have here is the most
elective of elective abortions. It's our view that Roe did not
legalize abortion on demand.''
   The appeals court said Mrs. Lewis' right to an abortion was
established in the landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision Roe
vs. Wade.
   The state Supreme Court justices decided they would not tamper
with the intermediate court's action. They did not explain why.
   ``The (U.S.) Supreme Court has to act within 24 hours on an
emergency request. I would imagine that we should be getting a
decision by Monday,'' said Shelley Spivack, one of the volunteer
American Civil Liberties Union attorneys representing Mrs. Lewis.
   In similar cases, the U.S. Supreme Court has denied emergency
appeals, said Spivack, who expects the justices to follow that
precedent.
   ``The law is set right now,'' she said. ``To change it would
require a full hearing before the U.S. Supreme Court and that would
take months and months.''
   ``If they want to revisit the 1976 decision about whether a
husband has veto power over a woman's abortion ... I would hope
they would not do that at Shawn Lewis' expense,'' said Michigan
ACLU executive director Howard Simon.
   Mrs. Lewis is at the end of her first trimester. She became
pregnant after a July 7 reconciliation with her husband. She had
filed for divorce in January and the couple wants to continue
divorce proceedings.
   Her attorneys have said Mrs. Lewis abided by the no-abortion
injunction for fear of jeopardizing her custody of her 16-month-old
child.
   Steven Moss, attorney for the husband Carlton Lewis, said at a
news conference Thursday afternoon in Flint that he had confidence
in the U.S. Supreme Court and expected them to take the appeal.

<HEAD>Officials Removed 250 Mailboxes After Boy Killed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death of a 6-year-old boy who was crushed
by a mailbox not bolted to the ground has led to a nationwide
safety alert and the removal of about 250 unanchored mailboxes in
Maryland and the District of Columbia, a postal service spokesman
said Thursday.
   U.S. Postal Service headquarters issued the alert Wednesday that
mailboxes nationwide should be checked, said Kent Smith, spokesman
for the postal service's Southern Maryland Division office.
   The division launched an inspection Wednesday of 6,000 mailboxes
in the district, Smith said.
   ``After the preliminary count, we had to remove about 5 percent
of the boxes because they were insufficiently anchored. We were
able to fasten down or secure virtually everything else,'' Smith
said. ``About 250 boxes were brought in. All boxes were checked and
those that were not secure and made safe were pulled off the
street.''
   Officials said the 160-pound mailbox that killed Marc Jeffrey
Streidel of Bethesda on Tuesday lacked bolts to anchor it to the
ground.
   Witnesses said the boy had been swinging on the chute when the
mailbox fell over on him.
   Glenn Streidel, Marc's father, said the boy ``was everything you
would want in a son. He was bright, he was very family-oriented, he
loved his sister, he had a leader personality, and he was my little
jock.''
   The mailbox ``wasn't very safe for anybody, especially a little
boy,'' Streidel said.
   ``The feet on these mailboxes are minuscule,'' Streidel said.
``You have a big, bulky box on four tiny feet.''
   Mail carriers are told to notify supervisors if they see that a
mailbox is not securely anchored, Smith said.
   ``Some reports made by neighbors indicated there was a lot of
movement of the box by the kid,'' Smith said. ``The ...
investigation is still reviewing documents and photographs and the
investigation is not complete.''
   Clarence Hoppert, retiring postmaster at the Bethesda Post
Office, told The Washington Post in a story published Thursday that
reports of vandalism are not acted on quickly because of a lack of
staff. Hoppert did not return a telephone message Thursday from The
Associated Press.
   Delays are compounded because the Postal Service's Southern
Maryland Division office has delayed for two years the hiring of a
mechanic in the Bethesda office who would, among other duties,
repair mailboxes, Hoppert said.
   ``The main thing was the safety of the boxes,'' Hoppert said.
   However, Smith said that he doubted what he called Hoppert's
``allegations.''
   ``Most of our carriers have said they don't have any problem
with stability,'' Smith said.

<TEXT>
   The government's $3.9 billion emergency
program to help farmers recover from this year's devastating
drought is set to begin operating on Oct. 3, Agriculture Secretary
Richard E. Lyng announced Thursday.
   President Reagan signed the Disaster Assistance Act on Aug. 11,
and the Agriculture Department has been working since then to put
the necessary regulations into effect and get county offices ready
to accept applications.
   Lyng said crop and livestock producers should organize their
production information and evidence in advance to help speed up
payments for qualified drought losses.
   The program will be handled by county offices of the
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, or ASCS.
   An agency spokesman, Ray Waggoner, said the counties will decide
on how to schedule payments to qualified applicants.
   ``In some cases, they (farmers) can get a check the same day
they apply, depending on how busy the offices are,'' Waggoner said.
``But it will depend on the local situation.''
   Waggoner said the first round of assistance will go crop
producers, followed by other programs for those who suffered losses
to livestock, forage and tree operations.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee on Thursday approved without dissent and sent to the
floor three nominations to the Federal Energy Commission.
   The action seals a deal between committee Democrats, who were
supported by Republicans, and the White House. The deal puts three
Democrats in the five seats and leaves the chairmanship in
Republican hands.
   The three nominees are Charles Trabandt and Charles Stalon,
currently sitting members of the commission, and Jerry Langdon, a
Midland, Texas, oil and gas consultant.
   Nominations of Martha Hesse, the chairman, and Elizabeth Moller,
a senior lawyer on the committee staff, were approved earlier and
all five are expected to reach the Senate floor as a package.
   Stalon, Ms. Moller and Langdon are Democrats. Stalon, a holdover
whose original term expired in October 1987, will take a vacancy
for a term expiring in October 1989, and Ms. Moller will move into
Stalon's seat for a term expiring in 1991.
   Ms. Hesse, another holdover who has been awaiting confirmation
for more than a year, would sit until 1991. Langdon and Trabandt
would get full terms expiring in 1992.
   The commission regulates interstate oil and gas pipelines and
some natural gas sales from producers to pipelines, licenses
hydroelectric dams and regulates wholesale sales of electricity.

   The National Endowment for the Arts on Thursday
announced $9 million in matching grants to 23 U.S. organizations.
   The largest, for $1 million, goes to Center Stage Associates
Inc. in Baltimore, for creating a system to pay artists more. The
smallest, two grants for $50,000 each, go to the Coordinating
Council of Literary Magazines in New York and to Monadnock Music in
Peterborough, N.H., the latter to establish a new listeners'
program for children and families.
   The ``Challenge III'' grants are meant to assist model projects
of national significance. They require the organizations to match
each federal dollar with at least $3 in new or increased donations.
   ``Through this new effort, the endowment wants to make a
difference in the arts _ to help launch creative new activities
with potential for long-term benefit to the arts in all sections of
this country,'' said endowment Chairman Frank Hodsoll.
   Challenge I and II grants, during the last decade, were designed
to increase arts organizations' long-term financial stability.
   ``We're particularly excited that so many fields that are
uninstitutionalized, like literature, are getting help from this
program,'' Hodsoll said. ``In the old Challenge program, we gave
money to universities' museums as opposed to the arts education
program Wayne State University is undertaking in Detroit public
schools.
   ``And the American Museum of the Moving Image in New York is
doing a curriculum on the media that can be used in schools,'' he
said.
   Wayne State's grant is $150,000 and the museum's grant is
$300,000.
   Other recipients of grants and amounts are: Ballet West, Salt
Lake City, for touring, $500,000; Bay Area Women's Philharmonic,
San Francisco, to record music by women composers, $85,000;
Brooklyn Academy of Music Inc., $750,000; City Celebration Inc.,
San Francisco, $100,000;
   The Cleveland Foundation, for cooperative programming and
marketing by 18 cultural organizations, $375,000; Council for the
Arts in Westchester, White Plains, N.Y., $100,000; Educational
Broadcasting Corporation-WNET, New York, for a series about
20th-century ballet, $750,000; Foundation for the Joffrey Ballet
Inc., New York, $700,000;
   Kentucky Educational Television, Lexington, to broadcast
regional arts performances, $250,000; the Louisville Orchestra,
$500,000; Maryland State Arts Council, $150,000; the Minnesota
Opera, $150,000; National Trust for Historic Preservation,
Washington, to link architectural preservation with tourism in six
states, $300,000; New England Foundation for the Arts, Cambridge,
Mass., $300,000;
   New York Dance Center, to secure a building for American Ballet
Theater and the Feld Ballet, $900,000; New York Foundation for the
Arts, to increase support for individual artists in seven states,
$800,000; North Carolina Museum of Art, Raleigh, $250,000; the
Pennsylvania Opera Theater, Philadelphia, to produce opera in
community residencies, $60,000; Southern Arts Federation Inc.,

<HEAD>Coleman Co. Chairman Dies At 86</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sheldon Coleman, chairman of the Coleman
Co. who spearheaded its diversification from camp stoves and
lanterns to air conditioning equipment and outdoors gear, has died.
He was 86.
   Coleman, son of the company's founder, died Wednesday night of
pneumonia at a hospital, his family said.
   ``We will miss him immeasurably,'' said his son, Sheldon C.
Coleman, company president and chief operating officer.
   The elder Coleman joined his father's company in 1925 shortly
after graduating from Cornell University with a mechanical
engineering degree. He became Coleman Co. chief executive officer
and executive vice president in October 1940 and was elected
chairman of the board in 1957.
   The company was founded by W.C. Coleman in 1900 in Kingfisher,
Okla., as a lighting-service business, leasing lamps and servicing
them. In 1901, the business moved to Wichita, where it began
producing lamps in 1905. It developed its famous Coleman lanterns,
which lengthened the farmer's day, in 1914.
   In 1920s, lamp and lantern production boomed. But the Coleman
family almost lost the company during the Great Depression.
   Coleman saw rural electrification coming and recommended the
company diversify by developing oil space heaters and gas floor
furnaces in the 1930s. It still produces heating and air
conditioning equipment, including units for mobile homes and
recreational vehicles.
   During the 1960s, Coleman led another diversification, expanding
lantern and camp stove production into dozens of outdoor recreation
products. The company eventually became the world's largest
manufacturer of such items.
   Last year, the publicly held company, which has more than 5,000
employees, had record sales of nearly $600 million.
   Coleman was active in a number of civic and professional
organizations, serving as vice chairman of the board of governors
of the American Red Cross, a member of the National Council of the
Boy Scouts of America and on President Reagan's Commission on
Americans Outdoors.
   Besides his son, Coleman is survived by his wife, Galey, a
brother, Clarence; two daughters, two stepsons, a stepdaughter, 14
grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
   The funeral is scheduled Saturday at Metropolitan Baptist Church
in Wichita.

   The South African activists at the U.S.
Consulate in Johannesburg agreed when they took refuge at the
facility that they would not have contact with the news media, the
State Department said Thursday.
   Black activist Winnie Mandela, who visited the consultate on
Wednesday, had complained that U.S. officials would not let the
three men make direct contact with reporters.
   But State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the ban on
media contact was among the conditions agreed to by the men and
their legal representatives so that the consulate could function as
usual.
   ``These guidelines are designed to safeguard long-term interests
of the three men and to allow our mission to carry out its normal
operations and to avoid activities incompatible with our diplomatic
presence in a foreign country,'' he said.
   Redman told reporters that a fourth man has been given temporary
refuge with the three who escaped detention in South Africa 10 days
ago. Clifford Ngcobo entered the consulate seeking refuge on
Wednesday after apparently escaping police custody during a
hospital visit, Redman said.
   ``He indicates that he is a member of the (banned) United
Democratic Front and had been in detention for five months prior to
his escape,'' said Redman. ``He is now in temporary refuge with the
three other UDF activists.''
   The situation of the first three activists is unchanged, Redman
said.
   ``They have not reached a decision on when or how they will
leave our consular premises,'' he said.
   ``We can't serve as a spokesman for them, but, when these people
arrived at the consulate, there were certain guidelines agreed on
with them,'' Redman said. ``No restrictions of any kind have been
placed on communications between the three men and their immediate
family members, their legal representatives, and the support
committee which they designated.

   A survey of 1,000 elementary and junior
high school students found their favorite movies to be ``Nightmare
on Elm Street'' and ``Friday the 13th.''
   The survey, conducted by the Junior League of Charleston, also
found that while such violent R-rated movies generally are rented
by adults, children manage to get access to them and prefer them to
movies targeted at their age groups.
   ``The results of this study suggest that adults rent R-rated
slasher films,'' a report on the study said. ``It does not
conclusively indicate that they rent those films for minors, but
minors are viewing them.''
   Rene McEldowney, a Marshall University statistics professor who
headed the project, said the league has begun to place posters in
video stores that explain the movie ratings system. The league also
hopes to organize groups of seven to 10 people to discuss the issue
of slasher movies.
   ``I don't think parents are uncaring or malicious. It's just
that they're in a hurry, and they don't have time to review the
contents of each movie they rent for their children,'' said Paula
Flaherty of the Junior League.
   Eighty-nine percent of the Kanawha County junior high students
surveyed recently said they watched ``Nightmare,'' while 77 percent
of the elementary students surveyed reported that they had seen it.
   For ``Friday the 13th,'' 86 percent of the junior high students
said they had seen it, compared to 66 percent of the elementary
students.
   Wes Bruce, director of research for the county school system,
said the actual number of students watching these movies probably
was slightly lower. Peer pressure and other factors could have
influenced children to report that they had seen these movies when
they actually hadn't, he said.
   ``But the point is the same,'' Bruce said. ``These movies are
readily accessible, and accessibility is only going to increase.''
   Of all the students surveyed, ``Nightmare'' was ranked as the
most popular and ``Friday the 13th'' placed second, followed by
``Predator'' and ``Dirty Dancing.''

   A man distraught over his car being
towed doused himself and two deputies with gasoline Thursday and
threatened to flick a cigarette lighter before being overpowered by
one of the officers, police said.
   James Stephens of Charleston was sent to the Weston State
Hospital for psychiatric observation after the incident in front of
the federal building downtown, sheriff's Sgt. Jim Chadwick said.
   Stephens had left a car unattended after it ran out of gas,
Chadwick said. When he returned with several gallons of gasoline in
a bucket, his car was hooked to a tow truck, the sergeant said.
   ``His car had run out of gas and when he got back to it, it was
being towed away,'' Chadwick said. ``He just lost his marbles.''
   Stephens chased the driver of the tow truck and began arguing
with him, Chadwick said. He then lay down on the sidewalk in front
of the federal building with the gasoline beside him.
   Chadwick and Deputy A.B. Burke approached, and Stephens soaked
the three with gasoline and threatened to light the lighter,
Chadwick said.
   ``One little spark and we'd have had a great big fireball,''
Chadwick said. ``The man intended to do harm to himself and
others.''
   Chadwick tried for about 15 minutes to talk the man into giving
up the lighter. While he spoke to the man, Burke approached from
the other side and grabbed the hand holding the lighter. The three
then were washed with water before Stephens was taken away in an
ambulance.

   A Chinese education official who ate soup
made from poisonous mushrooms remained hospitalized in critical
condition Thursday, officials said.
   Zhangjian Chen, 37, from the University of Beijing in China, has
not shown signs of recovery, but his condition didn't appear to be
worsening, said Yang Shiqi, a spokesman for the Consulate-General
of China.
   Chen's colleague, Lilly You, 32, who also ate the soup, was in
satisfactory condition Thursday.
   The pair were invited to this country about a month ago by
officials of the Baker and Taylor Co. of Bridgewater, N.J., a
wholesale book company owned by W.R. Grace & Co. of New York.
   Chris Tofalli, a spokesman for Grace, said they are looking at
libraries.
   The two, who are based in New York, apparently had been visiting
acquaintances in the Stamford area and had gone hiking Friday,
officials said. They picked four mushrooms, and made soup for
lunch, Stamford Hospital officials said.
   Late Friday, they started experiencing abdominal cramping,
nausea and vomiting, and were hospitalized early Saturday, said Dr.
Stuart Waldstreicher, who is treating them.
   The mushrooms were probably of the amanita virosa family of
highly toxic mushrooms popularly known as the ``Destroying Angel''
found in wooded areas throughout the Northeast from late June until
November, Waldstreicher said.

<HEAD>Government Agencies Find Computer Systems Need Security Measures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agencies have identified more than
53,000 government computer systems that require security measures
because they contain sensitive data, officials told Congress on
Thursday.
   Identifying the systems handling sensitive but unclassified
information is among a series of steps _ including improved
training programs for computer users _ mandated under the Computer
Security Act signed into law by President Reagan early this year.
   ``It appears that federal agencies are attempting to comply with
the act,'' the General Accounting Office said in a report presented
to a House Science subcommittee by Howard Rhile, associate director
of the GAO's information management and technology division.
   The GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, said that as of Sept.
8, 74 out of 84 agencies surveyed reported they had identified all
sensitive computer systems under their jurisdiction.
   It said 72 of the 74 agencies saying they had identified all
sensitive systems reported the number of systems involved. For the
72 agencies, the total came to 53,443 computer systems.
   ``Defense agencies reported an estimated 52,000 sensitive
systems or about 97 percent of the total number reported by all
agencies,'' the GAO said.
   For the defense agencies, the breakdown was: Navy, 27,000
systems; Army, 12,000; Air Force, 10,000; other Pentagon computer
systems, 3,000.
   Jay Plager, an official from the Office of Management and
Budget, told the panel that federal agencies have made a ``good
start'' in moving to implement the legislation, which calls for
agencies to submit detailed computer security plans by Jan. 8, 1989.
   ``We believe that the act gives us a framework and provides the
momentum for the government to address the security of federal
computer systems,'' he said in testimony before the transportation,
aviation and materials subcommittee.
   Plager said that in planning the security measures, OMB
officials have been working closely with the National Institute for
Standards and Technology, the National Security Agency and the
Office of Personnel Management.
   The importance of adequate computer security, he said, is
pointed up by the fact that ``next year the federal government will
invest more than $17 billion in building and maintaining federal
information technology systems _ systems which are critical to
every major activity of our government.''

   The Pentagon notified Congress on Thursday it
had approved three different arms sales to South Korea involving
reconnaissance jets, aircraft spare parts and Sparrow air-to-air
missiles.
   Combined, the three sales total $238 million, the Pentagon added.
   Assuming there are no congressional objections, the Defense
Department said the South Koreans would be sold 12 RF-4C
reconnaissance jets with radar-jamming capability at a cost of $138
million.
   The jets will be drawn from ``excess Air National Guard stocks''
and the Westinghouse Electric Corp. of Baltimore will provide the
radar-jamming pods, the Pentagon said. The U.S. Air Force will
oversee that transaction.
   In addition, South Korea will be sold spare sparts at a cost of
$79 million to support six types of U.S.-made aircraft already in
its inventory. The parts will be used for C-123K, F-4, F-5, T-33,
F-16 and A-T-37 aircraft and the Air Force will oversee the deal.
   The Koreans also will be offered 76 AIM-7F Sparrow air-to-air
missiles for their jet fighters at an estimated cost of $21
million, the Pentagon concluded. The U.S. Navy will oversee that
sale, for which the prime contractors will be the General Dynamics
Corp. and the Raytheon Co.

<TEXT>
   Ford Aerospace Corp. of Newport Beach, Calif.,
will pay the government $7 million to settle claims that the
company submitted false pricing data for bombing equipment sold to
the Air Force, the Justice Department announced Thursday.
   The false pricing allegations relate to three 1981 contracts for
the sale of Pave Tack pods, which are mounted on aircraft and,
through the use of lasers and computers, enable the aircraft to
guide bombs to targets.
   In a settlement agreement, the Justice Department alleged that
Ford certified and submitted cost or pricing information during
negotiations which was not accurate, complete or current.
   Using such data amounted to defective pricing, the government
said, causing the Air Force to rely on inaccurate information,
leading to possible overpricing of the pods.
   Ford will pay $7 million to the government within 30 days under
the terms of the agreement.
   The company also must absorb all of the expenses, including
legal costs, which it incurred in connection with the government's
audits and investigations, the Justice Department said in a
statement.

   Thieves are stealing more than $10,000 in tokens
a day from the city's nearly 3,000 subway turnstiles, in an
accelerating racket expected to cost the Transit Authority more
than $1 million in revenue this year.
   ``It's a matter of prying open the door _ warping it and popping
it open,'' said Russ Broshous, a TA vice president. ``Once warped,
it never fits properly again.''
   Law-abiding passengers deposit their $1 brass tokens into a
turnstile slot. The tokens drop into a canvas bag, which thieves
have discovered is increasingly easy to reach on antiquated
turnstiles.
   TA officials say the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is
expected to approve $300,000 Friday for the emergency purchase of
500 new quarter-inch steel vaults to be installed into turnstiles
at the worst-hit stations.
   The vaults, which will replace the canvas bags, will have
tamper-resistent screws, and token clerks will open them with a
higher security key than the ones now used. If the vaults are
effective, they'll be installed systemwide, Broshous said.
   People can regularly be seen hawking tokens at busy subway stops
to people who don't want to wait in line at the booths where
employees sell tokens.
   ``People should realize when they buy those tokens that they are
supporting someone who is preying on the system,'' said Al O'Leary,
spokesman for the transit police. ``It's drug abusers. It's the
homeless. It's people who see an easy opportunity. Because that's
what it is.''
   Some stations are robbed over and over again.
   A group of people will enter a station and look for police.
Lookouts are posted near entrances. Another accomplice will
distract the token clerk or block his view. Then a technician does
the actual break in, at the rate of about 10 to 15 seconds per
turnstile. Then the whole group goes to another station.
   ``It's almost as if there's a predetermined plan as to how to
carry it off,'' Broshous said.
   There are 13 types of turnstiles in use in the subway system's
463 stations. The oldest date to the late 1920s, are wooden and
were designed to accept nickels.
   ``In an era when people left their front doors open, it was a
secure turnstile. By today's crack-ridden standards, it's not,''
O'Leary said.

   Federal investigators examined a Pan Am
Express commuter plane Thursday after an engine exploded in flight
and sent flying debris into the passenger cabin, injuring nine
people.
   The four-engine, 50-seat DeHavilland-7 turboprop was carrying 13
passengers and three crew members Wednesday night from New York
City's Kennedy airport when the explosion occurred 13 miles from
Albany County Airport.
   The explosion was in the No. 2 engine, on the inside left-hand
side of the plane, Pan Am Express spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said.
   Since the plane already had started its landing approach, it was
at a low altitude and there was no depressurization from debris
puncturing the fuselage, said Kathleen Bergen, a spokeswoman for
the Federal Aviation Administration.
   The injured, including one flight attendant, were treated at
Albany Medical Center Hospital, spokesman Richard Puff said.
   All but one were treated and discharged. Steven Roecker, 33, of
Rexford was in fair condition Thursday with eye and facial
injuries, Puff said.
   The National Transportation Safety Board took over the
investigation Thursday, and a final report on the accident is not
expected for eight to nine months, said Alan Yurman, a board
spokesman in New York City.
   Hanlon said the approximately nine-year-old plane was to be
flown without passengers back to the company's headquarters in
Philadelphia late Thursday or early Friday.

   Convicted killer Robert Preston,
scheduled to die next week for stabbing a convenience store clerk
10 years ago, lost an appeal Thursday in the Florida Supreme Court.
   Preston, 31, is under his second death warrant for the Jan. 9,
1978, murder of Earline Walker, whose body was found with 20 stab
wounds, a slashed throat and a cross cut into her forehead.
   She was on duty during a late-night shift at a convenience store
in Forest City when Preston entered and robbed her of $574 at
knifepoint, according to court records. He then forced her into her
car, drove about 1{ miles and took her to a field where he forced
her to disrobe and then stabbed her, the records said. Her nude and
mutilated body was found later that day.
   In addition to his murder conviction and capital sentence handed
down in 1981, Preston was sentenced to life in prison for
kidnapping and 15 years for robbery.
   The Supreme Court rejected arguments that Preston's execution
should be delayed so that new evidence could be considered. Preston
planned to appeal next to U.S. District Court in Orlando, said
Larry Spalding, head of the agency that represents indigent
death-row inmates.
   Preston is scheduled to die in the state's electric chair at
Florida State Prison Tuesday morning.
   Six other death-row inmates are under death warrants in Florida.
Nine had been facing execution, but stays granted earlier this
month halted the executions of Stephen Todd Booker and Freddie Lee
Hall, who had been scheduled to die earlier this week.
   He would be the 18th prisoner executed in Florida and the 102nd
nationally since the 1976 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing states
to resume use of the death penalty.

   A millionaire businessman was found
dead Thursday near the suburban mansion where his estranged wife
was killed last week and his death was being investigated as a
suicide, authorities said.
   The body of Daniel Giwosky, 51, was found at the end of a
driveway of a neighbor's home. The medical examiner's office in
Milwaukee said he suffered a single gunshot wound to the head.
   Milwaukee County District Attorney E. Michael McCann said a gun
was found next to Giwosky's body and that preliminary indications
suggested the death was a suicide.
   On Friday, Giwosky told police he found the body of his wife,
Judith, 46, at the foot of the basement stairs in her home.
   A medical examiner's report said an autopsy showed evidence of
``crushing neck and traumatic head injuries,'' but further tests
were being done to pinpoint the cause of death.
   Giwosky, president of Fox Bay Co., which owns as many as 300
properties in Milwaukee's inner city, told police he found his wife
after going to the home to do laundry.
   He said the stairs leading to the basement were covered with
water because his wife had been cleaning them.
   He told police he changed his clothes and washed up after
cleaning up a large quantity of blood around the body.
Blood-stained trousers and a towel were found in the guest house.
   Police said Judith Giwosky called police just hours before her
death asking that a squad car drive by her home because she had
filed for divorce and had obtained a court order to keep her
husband out of the residence.
   Giwosky had been living in a guest house on the estate.
   No charges have been filed in Mrs. Giwosky's death.

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis is
holding on to his lead over Republican George Bush in Dukakis'
neighbor state of Rhode Island, according to a presidential poll
released Thursday.
   The Democratic presidential nominee was favored by 53 percent of
the 411 registered Rhode Island voters surveyed, while Bush was
supported by 35 percent, according to the poll released by WPRI-TV
and Fleming and Associates, of Pawtucket. Twelve percent of the
voters were undecided.
   Dukakis' lead in the poll, taken Sept. 17-18, has slipped 3
pecentage points from a survey taken by Fleming in mid-July, while
Bush's lead increased 3 percentage points, WPRI said.
   But, with the poll's margin of error of 5 percentage points, the
change is statistically insignificant.

   A minister sobbed Thursday while
describing how he shot to death and then decapitated a church
handyman to fake his own death in a scheme inspired by an
advertisement in Soldier of Fortune magazine.
   John David Terry was found guilty Thursday of first-degree
murder and arson in the death of handyman James Chester Matheny. He
later took the stand in a hearing to decide whether he should be
sentenced to death for the June 15, 1987, killing.
   The minister said an advertisement in the magazine made him
believe he could begin a new life by assuming the name of a dead
person.
   ``I just reached a point in my life that I didn't want to
live,'' Terry said. ``I just felt I was going crazy, losing my
mind.''
   Prosecutor John Zimmermann said Terry embezzled church money and
his plan was foiled only because firefighters arrived before
Matheny's body, left in the burning church's attic, was burned
beyond recognition.
   A medical examination determined the body was not Terry's.
   Terry, former pastor of the Emmanuel Church of Christ Oneness
Pentecostal, told the jury he was severely depressed following his
mother's death in 1983 and took out an insurance policy because he
was going to commit suicide.
   ``I reached a point in my ministry, I just felt like a complete
failure,'' Terry testified. ``The church wasn't growing and I
thought it was my fault.''
   Terry said he decided to leave the ministry. But when part-time
work selling aluminum siding didn't help, he got to the point where
he had difficulty talking to people, Terry said.
   That was when he spotted the magazine for military buffs. ``It
just jumped out of that page ... How to get lost ... How to
disappear,'' Terry said. ``It was something that began to feed a
person looking for an escape.''
   Terry testified that he tried to obtain birth certificates and
identification in the name of a deceased childhood friend. When
that failed, he went to the library and reviewed old newspaper
stories seeking an identity. One story told of a 7-year-old boy who
had drowned with his father on a fishing trip.
   Witnesses testified during the trial that Terry obtained a
driver's license and Social Security card under the name of Jerry
Winston Milom, who died at age 7 in 1951.
   ``I was functioning on the outside, but inside I was going
through hell, pure hell,'' Terry said. ``I couldn't reach out to
anyone. I was trying to work it out. I worked it out, but I worked
it out in the wrong way.''
   Terry testified that he was a ``failure at everything.
   ``I was even a failure at trying to take my own life. Every time
I tried to pull the trigger my mother's face would come up and I
couldn't pull the trigger,'' he said, sobbing. ``I knew I would
never see her again if I did that.''

<HEAD>Police Union Offers To Pay For Cars Damaged During Wet T-Shirt
Contest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A police union Thursday offered to pay
for damage that apparently occurred at its big annual picnic when
people jumped on top of patrol cars to view a wet T-shirt contest
among female officers.
   Damage to the six vehicles was estimated at less than $10,000,
according to Sgt. Scott O'Mara, a state police spokesman.
   Neither O'Mara nor the union would confirm the report of the
contest, published in Thursday's edition of The Hartford Courant.
   ``We now have started six separate investigations to determine
the exact circumstances. We'll have to take it from there,'' said
O'Mara.
   The Connecticut State Police Union said in a statement issued
late Thursday that it would pay even though it maintained no
Connecticut troopers caused any damage. The union was host to 1,800
active and retired state police officers from seven states at the
Sept. 14 picnic at Mountainside Park in Wallingford.
   The picnic is an annual event rotated among states and is
sponsored by a national police organization, Robert Kowalczyk,
president of the Connecticut State Police Union, told the newspaper.
   At the time he was interviewed by the Courant, Kowalczyk denied
that any damage was done at the picnic and said he had no knowledge
that a wet T-shirt contest was held.
   ``We had arm wrestling and a road race. There was baseball, but
that (a wet T-shirt contest) would not have been a sanctioned
event,'' Kowalczyk said.
   The newspaper quoted a picnic-goer who spoke only if guaranteed
anonymity as saying the contest was organized by a member of an
out-of-state department following an afternoon of beer drinking.
   The out-of-state officer used the park's public-address system
to speak glowingly of the female officers of his department and
challenged all comers to match their physiques, the witness said.
   Kowalczyk was not at union headquarters Thursday and couldn't be
reached for comment, secretaries at his office told The Associated
Press.
   The union said in it statement that it would seek to make
responsible parties reimburse it for the costs.
   Forst said he was pleased with the union's decision and said it
showed responsible leadership.

   A congressional panel Thursday recommended
linking U.S. and World Bank aid to Burundi to that country's
efforts to end ethnic discrimination and willingness to allow
international investigation into tribal massacres that claimed up
to 20,000 lives last month.
   A resolution threatening suspension of U.S. aid after six months
and U.S. opposition to World Bank assistance after a year was
adopted on a voice vote by the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee
on Africa.
   ``All countries must be made to understand that if their armed
forces kill civilians, there will be repercussions in their
relations with the United States,'' Rep. William Gray, D-Pa.,
asserted in support of the legislation introduced by Rep. Ted
Weiss, D-N.Y.
   Gray was referring to revenge slayings of an estimated
5,000-20,000 Hutu tribespeople in mid-August by Burundi soldiers
who belong mainly to the Tutsi tribe, a minority that has dominated
the Central African country for generations. More than 60,000 Hutus
fled to neighboring Rwanda, the panel was told.
   The Burundi army was responding to the massacre of an estimated
2,000-3,000 people, many of them Tutsis, in a preemptive attack by
majority Hutus. They reportedly feared the Tutsis were planning a
repetition of the 1972 slaying of 100,000-200,000 Huus in one of
modern Africa's bloodiest episodes.
   The United States in early August launched a $4.5 million
five-year population control program for Burundi, in addition to
$5.2 million in 1988 economic aid for health, rural development and
environment programs.
   Burundi is to draw $80 million in grants and concessional loans
from the World Bank this year, making it the largest per capita
recipient of such low-interest credit, Weiss said.
   State Department witnesses at the joint hearing of the Africa
and human rights subcommittees backed the resolution's intent. But
they voiced misgivings that setting deadlines could undermine
efforts of President Pierre Buyoya to promote equality in Burundi
and punish wrongdoing despite resistance by extremists among the
ruling Tutsis.
   Buyoya came to power in a bloodless coup a year ago, and ``it is
sadly ironic that these tragic events should have taken place under
... a government committed to policy reform and ethnic
reconciliation,'' said Kenneth L. Brown, deputy assistant secretary
of state for African affairs.
   ``The difference is tremendous'' between the Buyoya government
and previous Burundi regimes, Brown said. ``We feel this is a man
who is on the right track and should be supported against those who
would act against the interests of the Burundian people.''
   ``Those are noble words, but actions speak louder than words,''
said Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind. ``I suggest our State Department
convey to Burundi that ... if officers engaged in genocide, they
should be brought to justice expeditiously.''
   Buyoya has ruled out investigation by international bodies of
what he says is an internal Burundian problem.

<HEAD>Papal Document Rules Out Women Priests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major Vatican document scheduled for release this
month rules out priesthood for women but calls for greater respect
for them, a Vatican official said Thursday.
   The document on the ``Dignity of Woman,'' due to be made public
Sept. 30, breaks little new ground, the official said.
   The Roman Catholic Church has always barred women from the
priesthood but Pope John Paul II recently increased his efforts to
promote respect for women.
   The Vatican's limitations on women have been one of the most
vexing issues for the church in the United States and Western
Europe. The official, who is familiar with the document and spoke
on condition of anonymity, conceded that it will disappoint some
women.
   The official said the pope's document was very ``personal'' and
called it a ``theological, anthropological meditation on the
meaning of Christian womanhood.''
   The document says women cannot be priests because Jesus did not
choose them for such a role during his lifetime.
   The pope rejected the argument that Jesus was influenced by
sociological factors such as the low status of women at the time.
   The Italian news agency AGI, which said it had access to the
document, quoted it as saying:
   ``When Christ called only men to be his apostles, he did it in a
totally free and sovereign way. He did it with the same liberty
with which in all his acts he recognized the dignity and vocation
of women, without conforming to the dominant practice and the
tradition embodied in the legislation of his time.''
   John Paul went on to say that Jesus reserved for men the most
important priestly duty, the consecration of the Eucharist, thus
indicating they only should be priests, according to the AGI report.
   Under the Catholic faith, consecration transforms bread into the
Eucharist, or body of Jesus, during the Mass.
   ``If Christ, in instituting the Eucharist, linked it in such an
explicit manner to the priestly service of the Apostles, it is
right to think that by this he wanted to express the relation
between man and woman, that is what is `feminine' and what is
`masculine,' intended by God both in the mystery of creation and in
the mystery of the redemption,'' the pope wrote, according to AGI.
   The pope has said repeatedly that the all-male priesthood is a
result of Jesus' designs for the church, rather than discrimination.
   In a draft letter issued in April, Roman Catholic bishops in the
United States recommended that the church study the possibility of
installing women as permanent deacons _ a step below priesthood.
American bishops have been among the strongest supporters of an
expanded role for women.
   In the new document, John Paul criticizes discrimination against
women, saying ``the truth revealed in the creation of human beings
... constitutes the principal argument against situations that are
objectively damaging or unjust,'' AGI reported.
   But he says men and women are different by nature, with neither
gender's characteristics superior, the AGI report said.
   ``Women, in the name of liberation from the `domination' of men,
should not try to appropriate masculine characteristics that do not
correspond with their own original femininity,'' he wrote,
according to AGI.
   ``There exists a well-founded fear that further down this road,
women won't `realize themselves,' and instead will deform and lose
that which constitutes their essential richness.''
   The Vatican official said the document repeats the pope's
support for women who want to raise children full-time, instead of
working outside the house.
   It also asks men to reflect on whether they see their wives as
sex objects rather than partners.

   A man who wounded six people and killed
himself during a shooting spree apparently was upset about a
neighborhood cat that devoured rabbits he raised to feed to a pet
alligator, officials said Thursday.
   Victims of the 100-round shooting frenzy included an
18-month-old boy hit by flying glass and bullet fragments.
   Two people were seriously wounded, including a man shot in the
chest and a woman shot in the face, said Lt. Randy Mancini.
   Shots were first reported fired in the Palms district around
11:15 p.m. Wednesday, and continued until about 1 a.m. Thursday.
   Officers found the gunman, John Wise, 38, dead, apparently of a
self-inflcted gunshot, shortly before 4 a.m., Mancini said. The
body was inside a shed housing a penned-off pond that was home to a
small alligator, Mancini said.
   A MAC-10 machine pistol was found along with 14 weapons, but was
not believed to have been used, said Detective Lee Kingsford.
   Derrek Brown, supervising animal control officer in the West Los
Angeles animal shelter, said Wise called Wednesday, complaining
about a cat who had been eating ``a total of about 100 rabbits over
three years,'' and wanting to know if he could shoot it.
   Brown told him it was illegal to discharge a firearm in the city.
   ``He was pretty upset,'' Brown said. ``He was just fed up.''
   The man calmed down and was told an officer would investigate
this week or next, Brown said.
   The rabbits, left to run free in the yard along with some ducks,
were raised to feed the alligator, he said.
   Police said they doubted the missing rabbits were solely
responsible for triggering the shooting. Neighhors said Wise, who
lived alone, also was upset over a separation from his wife.
   Police said Wise started shooting at cars on a busy road near
his home, and injured people in three vehicles. He also fired shots
at police helicopters, but did not strike them.
   No shots were fired at police on the ground, nor did police fire
at Wise, Mancini said.

<HEAD>Politburo Warns Against Efforts to Derail Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling Politburo of the Communist
Party warned Thursday against attempts to undermine the
``partner-like trustworthiness'' established in talks this month
between the authorities and the opposition.
   The Politburo met Tuesday, one day after the government of Prime
Minister Zbigniew Messner resigned under fire for mishandling the
economy.
   A Politburo statement issued Thursday made no comment on the
resignation, saying only that the Politburo discussed the decisions
of parliament.
   It urged participants to refrain from disclosing details of
meetings held in preparation for the round-table talks the
government has promised on the future of the banned trade union
movement Solidarity.
   ``All attempts to establish accomplished facts, provoke emotions
during different meetings, publicize with the help of foreign mass
media a biased picture of talks affect this cause and undermine the
partner-like trustworthiness,'' the statement said.
   It appeared to refer to a detailed account given by Wladyslaw
Frasyniuk to Western reporters Saturday on the third meeting among
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa; Solidarity and official union
activists, and Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak.
   Frasyniuk is a Solidarity regional leader from Wroclaw.
   The issue of trade unions has been the main topic of debate in
talks between Walesa and Kiszczak prompted by August strikes, the
worst labor unrest in seven years.
   At a meeting Sept. 16, Walesa and Kiszczak agreed that
round-table talks would begin in mid-October.
   The party, at a plenum on Aug. 27-28, appeared to exclude the
possibility of two trade unions operating in a single plant. The
party has not spelled out its policy on trade union reform,
although it now appears that changes may be possbile.
   ``At present, of special significance for the labor movement is
further improvement of its model and structure. This should be
favored by the amendments to the law on trade unions,'' the
Politburo said Thursday.
   Party leader Wojciech Jaruzelski criticized the government at
the plenum during the strike wave. At the meeting, Jaruzelski said
the government's future would be decided at this month's meeting of
parliament.
   A new government will be named Sept. 27, the state-run news
agency PAP announced earlier.

   The Southern Baptist social-concerns arm
has decided to quit distributing the Surgeon General's Report on
AIDS, which calls for stepped-up sex education in schools.
   The denomination's Chistian Life Commission, which lately has
come under fundamentalist control as have most denominational
agencies, took the action last week without discussion, Baptist
Press reports.
   However, the commissioner who moved the action, Ruth Morgan of
Bartlesville, Okla., said the report prepared by U.S. Surgeon
General C. Edward Koop fails to mention morals or a sense of right
and wrong in sex.
   ``We're going for total abstinence,'' she said. ``No pamphlet
printed or mailed by the Christian Life Commission should promote
anything except sex within marriage.''
   Concerning the report's advocacy of the use of condoms to
prevent AIDS, she said, ``There is no mention of condom-failure
rate. They are saying now it could be as high as 30 percent to 50
percent in homosexual activity.''
   The commission, which recently had a turnover in administration,
also decided to drop a pamphlet that favors abolition of capital
punishment.

<HEAD>Witness Says British Commandos Shot At IRA Members on Ground</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GIBRALTAR (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A witness to the March shooting deaths of three
unarmed IRA members on Thursday said one of the agents raised her
hands in surrender but British commandos kept shooting after she
and another agent fell to the ground.
   A third Irish Republican Army member a short distance away also
was shot and killed in the March 6 incident.
   
   Maxie Proetta told an inquest he was looking out a window of his
first-floor apartment when he saw several men follow and then open
fire on a woman and a man, later identified as IRA members Mairead
Farrell, 31, and Daniel McCann, 31.
   ``Before the shots, the girl went like this,'' he said, putting
his hands up by his head.
   Proetta said Farrell fell to the ground after the firing began.
   ``The men were still pointing at the bodies and I heard a few
shots,'' Proetta told the court. ``I thought they were firing at
the bodies on the ground.''
   His testimony came on the 13th day of an inquest by Gibraltar
Coroner Felix Pizzarello and an 11-man jury into the shooting
deaths Ms. Farrell, McCann and Sean Savage, 24, who were suspected
of planting a car bomb in the British colony at Spain's southern
tip.
   The inquest has no power of prosecution. Its aim is to determine
whether the police action was lawful.
   On Wednesday, Josephine Celecia, also a Gibraltar resident, said
she witnessed the shooting of Farrell and McCann and believed the
man who shot them kept shooting after they fell to the ground
wounded.
   Critics of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government
have claimed the shootings are evidence of an unofficial
``shoot-to-kill'' policy against members of the IRA.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule of the
Protestant-majority Northern Ireland and unite it with the Roman
Catholic Irish republic.
   Seven Special Air Service (SAS) commandos and several British
intelligence officers have testified they believed the three IRA
members were armed and dangerous and on a mission to set off a car
bomb in Gibraltar by a radio-control device when they were shot.
   The commandos have testified they had planned to arrest the
three but opened fire when Farrell and McCann made threatening
movements. They pumped more than two dozen bullets into the bodies
of the three IRA members.
   Savage parked a car a car in Gibraltar hours before the
shootings, but neither it nor another IRA car found across the
border into Spain contained a bomb.
   Days later, Spanish police located a third car packed with 141
pounds of explosives and a timing device in the nearby resort of
Marbella.
   While the three proved to be unarmed, the IRA acknowledged they
were on ``active service,'' meaning they were on a mission to
strike at British targets.

   Evangelist Mario ``Tony'' Leyva was convicted
Thursdasy of sodomizing two teen-age boys and said he accepted the
verdict as the will of God.
   Jurors deliberated 3{ hours before convicting Leyva of
sodomizing one teen-age boy in 1984 and another in 1987.
   The preacher told reporters while the jury was deliberating that
the trial was part of the chaos that will fill the world as it
nears its end.
   Some of Leyva's supporters wept as the verdicts were read, but
the minister, who had maintained his innocence, showed no emotion.
   Leyva, who also faces a federal charges of using his traveling
ministry to transport male minors with the intent to engage in
criminal sexual activity and prostitution, accepted the verdict as
God's will.
   ``God's been good to me,'' said Levya, who faces a maximum
penalty of 10 years in prison. ``He's never let me down. I don't
know what he's got in mind, but he won't let me down.''
   During the two-day trial, both victims testified against the
preacher. The prosecution also called four other witnesses who
claimed they had been molested by Leyva as far back as 1967, even
though he was not charged in those cases.
   The jury recommended a prison sentence of 2{ years. Roanoke
County Circuit Judge Kenneth E. Trabue set sentencing for Oct. 26
and freed Leyva on $10,000 bond.
   Leyva testified that he had slept in the same motel bed with
each of the boys he was accused of sodomizing, but he denied they
had sex.
   The victims testified that Leyva had taken sexual advantage of
them dozens of times after their parents had allowed them to spend
the night with the preacher.
   Defense attorney Harry F. Bosen Jr. called more than a dozen
witnesses who asserted that Leyva was not known to be a child
molester or a homosexual.
   Leyva faces trial next month on the federal charges of using
boys in an interstate prostitution ring. He faces up to 65 years in
prison and $550,000 in fines.
   Two of his followers also are charged in that case. Organist
Rias Edward Morris faces 45 years and $530,000 in fines and Freddie
M. Herring faces up to 25 years in prison and $510,000 in fines.
   Leyva said the charges have hurt his Tony Leyva Evangelistic
Association Inc.
   He said the Columbus, Ga.-based ministry was ``$75,000 in the
red. We've lost our television and radio ministry. It's affected
the credibility and faith of many church folks.''

   Peruvians protesting government austerity
measures battled riot police with rocks during demonstrations
Thursday, hours after two bombs exploded outside public offices and
wounded 19 bystanders.
   Police said they detained more than 100 protesters but had no
information about the number of people hurt.
   About 200 striking civilian workers demanding higher pay at a
navy shipyard threw rocks at security forces at Plaza Manco Capac,
reporters said.
   The government has declared the strike illegal and threatened to
fire the employees if they fail to return to work by Friday.
   An austerity program announced by the government of populist
President Alan Garcia on Sept. 6 led to widespread protests and
looting in many provincial cities.
   The program included a currency devaluation of 86 percent and
elimination of costly government subsidies of basic consumer items
which contribute to an inflation rate expected to reach 1,000
percent this year.
   Riot police tried to turn back a demonstration by 4,000
shantytown settlers who marched from Lima's outskirts toward the
downtown area to protest price increases of up to 500 percent for
some consumer items in the last two weeks.
   Police fired tear gas but the crowd was so large that most
marchers managed to break past barricades and regroup at Plaza 2 de
Mayo, 15 blocks from the Government Palace.
   Police fired buckshot and tear gas grenades in Plaza San Martin
to break up a demonstration of 2,000 people led by women banging
empty pots to protest the austerity program. Police acted when the
protesters tried to march the six blocks from the plaza to the
Government Palace.
   An Associated Press newsman saw a girl about 10 years old
bleeding from buckshot wounds in the face.
   A bomb containing about five pounds of dynamite exploded at
10:25 p.m. Wednesday (11:25 p.m. EDT) at a side entrance to the
Economy Ministry in downtown Lima. The blast severely injured a
12-year-old girl selling hot drinks from a street vendor's cart, a
policeman and 17 other people, many of them waiting for buses,
police said.
   Officers said the bomb was left beside the cart by pro-Cuban
guerrillas.
   Another bomb the same size exploded three minutes later and 12
blocks away outside an office of the Agriculture Ministry, but
caused no injuries.
   Police said pamphlets from the pro-Cuba Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement which were left at the site attacked the
austerity measures as a ``cruel and unjustified blow to the poor.''
   Elsewhere, three hooded gunmen believed to be guerrillas from
the Maoist Shining Path movement killed a village mayor five miles
outside Trujillo, a city 350 miles northwest of Lima, as his
l5-year-old son looked on Wednesday, police said.

<HEAD>Study: Lack of Sleep By Doctors Not Harmful To Patients</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors who go short on sleep because of their
rigorous hospital schedules can care for patients just as well as
doctors who are well-rested, according to a new study.
   The report in Friday's editions of the Journal of the American
Medical Association disputes other studies showing that prolonged
sleep loss adversely affects mental functions, said Dr. Timothy F.
Deaconson, its chief author.
   ``We conclude that the repetitive episodes of sleep deprivation
associated with an every-other-night on-call schedule do not impair
the performance of residents,'' the study found.
   Sleep deprivation was defined as a lack of four continuous hours
of sleep during the preceding 24-hour period, the study said.
   That condition occurred in 89 percent of 20 nights covered by
the study among the 26 residents at Milwaukee County Hospital.
   Researchers at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee,
led by Deaconson, investigated whether surgical residents'
performance was hurt by their sleep loss due to schedules that
require them to work all night.
   The residents kept diaries detailing the amount of sleep they
received and then were tested for rapid hand-eye coordination,
visual and auditory skills and understanding.
   ``I was not surprised at the results,'' Deaconson said in an
interview Thursday. ``I was surprised at how one-sided they were. I
was surprised there was very little difference between the sleep
deprived residents and those who got rest.
   ``I was expecting some people to show a difference and some not
to and I was surprised that the results were so uniform,'' he said.
   The study comes as hospitals and doctors are looking into the
possibility of reducing the number of hours residents are forced to
work because of concerns for patient care.
   Deaconson's study said the issue should not be decided quickly.
   ``Criticism of traditional hospital on-call schedules should be
based on objective data,'' the study said. ``The evidence available
to date does not support abitrary recommendations to limit the
working hours of residents.''

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former foreign minister and
ambassador to the United States was released from armed forces
custody, but an opposition activist was arrested Thursday by
security agents and charged with subversion.
   Dominador Bazaan, the former minister, said his six-day
detention was politically motivated and stemmed from his close
relations with deposed President Eric Arturo Delvalle.
   Police and security agents meanwhile arrested opposition
activist Alberto Conte and took over Conte's publicity firm in the
capital, witnesses said.
   Lawmakers allied with Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, commander of
Panama's Defense Forces and the country's de facto ruler, ousted
Delvalle Feb. 26 after Delvalle tried to fire the general. Noriega
is under U.S. indictment on drug trafficking charges.
   Bazaan, 50, said he received ``correct treatment'' while
detained at Panama City's Modelo Prison, where he shared a cell
with eight common criminals.
   He said he was released Wednesday night after relatives paid
$10,000 bail.
   Bazaan, who served as ambassador in Washington from September
1985 to February 1987, said he still considered Delvalle ``the
president (of Panama), but this has its limitations.'' He said he
had had no personal contact with Delvalle since Feb. 26 and has
made no effort to find him.
   Delvalle went into hiding after his ouster. The United States
still recognizes him as Panama's legitimate president.
   A government official who spoke on condition of anonymity said
Conte, a leader of the opposition National Civic Crusade protest
movement, was charged with engaging in activities against state
security.
   The Defense Forces had no comment about the arrest.
   Employees of Conte's firm said the agents confiscated documents
and disconnected telephones at the offices.
   Conte, also president of Panama's journalists' college, was
jailed for eight days in October last year in connection with his
opposition activities.
   The National Civic Crusade, a coalition of professional,
business and labor groups, staged numerous protests last year
calling on Noriega to resign.

   The savings industry, dragged down by
continuing big losses in Texas, is headed for its worst year since
the Great Depression, according to a government report.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Thursday that the nation's
thrift institutions lost $7.5 billion in the first six months of
1988, almost as much as the $7.8 billion loss for all of last year,
a post-Depression record.
   ``The losses for the year are clearly going to exceed the record
losses of last year,'' said Martin Regalia, an economist with the
National Council of Savings Institutions, a trade group.
   ``I would say there is a very good chance we're going to see
losses in the $10 billion to $11 billion range and maybe more,'' he
said.

   The House adopted legislation that could make
Americans pay dearly for possessing a single marijuana cigarette or
a small bag of cocaine, and the Senate must decide whether to
follow suit.
   The drug-fighting bill passed the House on a bipartisan 375-30
vote Thursday, after minority Republicans molded the legislation to
target drug users for special punishment.
   Those who consider themselves recreational users could, under
the bill: lose student loans, public housing and other federal
benefits; face civil penalties of up to $10,000 for each drug
possession violation; and have their drivers' licenses suspended if
their states participate in a proposed drug enforcement grant
program.

   A bill to expand voluntary AIDS testing among
high-risk individuals neared House passage with wide bipartisan
majorities turning back proposals to force tests on prisoners,
hospital patients and marriage license applicants.
   Lawmakers also defeated by a large margin a proposal requiring
states to collect identifying information on people who test
positive for the AIDS virus.
   Opponents successfully argued that anonymous testing is a much
better way to attract people at highest risk of being infected with
AIDS and that testing resources need to be concentrated on those
people rather than populations that probably haven't been exposed.

   The government is back in the business of
selling thousands of single-family houses to the highest bidder,
but human rights groups are demanding that they be used to shelter
the nation's homeless.
   Department of Housing and Urban Development officials said
Thursday they expect sale contracts to be signed for 2,500 houses
within the next few days, and most such sales are to families with
low-to-moderate incomes.
   About 27,000 HUD-owned houses across the country went back on
the market Thursday morning, following U. S. District Judge Oliver
Gasch's refusal to extend a ban on their sale. Contracts on the
2,500 were almost ready to be signed when Gasch issued a temporary
restraining order three weeks ago.

   An unemployed beautician said to be seething with
anger since he served in Vietnam announced ``I'm going to kill
everybody I see'' and went on a rampage, shooting to death two
store clerks, a school custodian and a policewoman.
   As Clemie Henderson continued to stalk a school for troubled

feet and shot the gunman dead Thursday in an exchange of gunfire.
   ``He's a genuine hero,'' Chicago Police Superintendent LeRoy
Martin said of Officer Greg Jaglowski, a 14-year police veteran.
   Henderson, 40, had been charged at least nine times between 1971
and last month for such offenses as battery, marijuana possession

   Pope John Paul II has finished work on a major
document that calls for more respect for women but upholds a Roman
Catholic ban on women priests, according to a Vatican official.
   The statement, to be made public Sept. 30, comes in response to
a worldwide bishops' synod last October that condemned sexual
discrimination. The pope has also said he wanted to reflect on the
role of women at the end of a year that the church devoted to Mary,
the mother of Jesus.
   The document on the ``Dignity of Woman'' contains few surprises,
said the Vatican official, who is familiar with it. However, it
goes into considerable detail in justifying the church's denial of
the priesthood to women.

   The oil futures market has gained more strength
in anticipation of this weekend's OPEC price committee meeting.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, settled
9 cents higher at $14.65 a barrel Thursday. Other contract months
also were higher at the close.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery gained 0.50
cent to close at 45.85 cents a gallon, while other contract months
closed mixed.
   The October wholesale heating oil contract lost 0.03 cent to
settle at 41.06 cents a gallon. Other heating oil contracts settled
mostly higher.
   Analysts said the market continued firming in anticipation of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' price monitoring
committee meeting scheduled for Sunday and Monday.
   ``Although there's no overreaction, there's a firm undertone on
the possibility that there might be some news from OPEC,'' said
Chris McCormack a trader with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   U.S. market prices were aided early in the day by reports of a
fire on an oil drilling platform in the North Sea, but slacked off
on news that the blaze was under control, analysts said.
   But the market's overall strength continued to be OPEC-related,
analysts said.
   ``The market is showing very rational behavior to not react to
rumors in advance of the OPEC meeting,'' said Bob Baker, an analyst
with Prudential BAche Securities Inc. ``The market is properly not
expecting anything significant to come out of the price committee
meeting. But it's a hopeful sign overall.''
   The five-member pricing committee has no authority to decide
policy but can call a meeting of all 13 members of the cartel. Oil
prices hit two-year lows recently because of the world oversupply
of oil and reports that many OPEC members were exceeding production
quotas.
   The price committee meeting suggests the possibility that OPEC
members might get together and set production limits that would
raise world oil prices.
   The five committee members are Venezuela, Algeria, Saudi Arabia,
Indonesia and Nigeria.

   The head of the International Monetary Fund is
urging private bankers to write off some debts owed them by
developing nations, and said the industrial nations need to work
more closely with the Third World to improve the global economy.
   ``There is no prosperity for the industrial countries without
prosperity for the developing countries,'' Michel Camdessus said at
the start of World Bank-International Monetary Fund talks Thursday
in West Berlin.
   Poor countries have been among the best customers of the richer
industrial world. But in recent years, their heavy debt payments
have forced them to cut back their purchases.
   Camdessus praised West Germany, Canada and the Nordic countries
for reducing the debts owed them by the poorest Third World
countries.
   The United States, a major creditor of such countries, has not
forgiven any debts. That would require action by Congress, where
support is weak for foreign aid, especially in an election year.
   Camdessus said private bankers also should write off some debts,
and said he recently has heard more of them discussing the
possibility.
   The World Bank estimates that the Third World debt burden at the
end of 1987 was $1.2 trillion.
   Delegates from the 151 World Bank and IMF member countries as
well as representatives of banking and industry have been arriving
all week for the West Berlin discussions.
   The talks culminate with the Sept. 27-29 joint meeting of the
two sister organizations.
   West Berlin is teeming with police officers hoping to ward off
attempts by leftist militants to disrupt the financial discussions.
   In addition to West Berlin's 6,000-strong force, 2,700 other
police officers have been brought in from across West Germany to
help with security.
   Officials fear violence could erupt in connection with
demonstrations planned by opponents to the policies of the World
Bank and IMF.
   Organizers of the demonstrations contend that Third World
countries are being impoverished by the repayment terms of their
loans.
   Fears of possible violence on West Berlin streets intensified
with Tuesday's failed ambush of a high-ranking West German Finance
Ministry official in Bonn.
   Addressing reporters, Camdessus also spoke about the recent rise
of the U.S. dollar, saying the higher rate would make it harder to
reduce the U.S. international trade deficit.
   A more costly dollar makes imported goods cheaper and more
attractive to Americans, while making American goods more expensive
and thus harder to export.
   But Camdessus also said the increase in the dollar does not
justify too much concern.
   He said that since the 1985 agreement between then-U.S. Treasury
Secretary James A. Baker III and his counterparts from other major
countries, the dollar has continued to fluctuate. But Camdessus
said the fluctuations are less violent and within a narrower range.
   ``This is quite an achievement, it has to be maintained,'' he
said.
   He gets a chance to push his ideas at a meeting Saturday of the
``Group of Seven,'' which brings together the major powers of the
non-Communist world. Nicholas Brady, the new U.S. secretary of the
treasury, will be meeting for the first time with ministers from
Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.

<HEAD>Macmillan Drops Backing for One Buyout Bid, Takes No Position on
Another</HEAD>

   Macmillan Inc. wants buyout bidding for it to
continue, and has backed out of a $2.36 billion buyout agreement
while refusing to take a position on a higher offer.
   Less than two weeks after agreeing to a leveraged buyout led by
the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., Macmillan said
Thursday it was withdrawing its support for the $85-a-share bid.
   But at the same time, the publishing giant declined to take a
position on the competing $2.41 billion bid by British publisher
Robert Maxwell.
   The company said its board wanted to ``continue the auction
process'' that already has driven its stock price up by about 70
percent since mid-May.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Macmillan
stock rose 50 cents a share to $86.87{ on Thursday.
   The Kohlberg Kravis bid included cash and securities, while
Maxwell has said he would pay $86.80 in cash for each of
Macmillan's 27.8 million shares.
   Macmillan said Thursday its board voted to withdraw its
recommendation that shareholders accept the Kohlberg Kravis bid.
But it said Kohlberg Kravis had told Macmillan it might amend its
offer.
   Macmillan's board decided to take no position immediately on
Maxwell's offer ``in light of the board's determination to continue
the auction process.''
   Macmillan said its board ``affirmed its willingness to consider
the Maxwell offer and any other offers that may be made by Maxwell
or KKR or any other person and instructed its advisers to continue
to seek to obtain maximum value for Macmillan's shareholders.''
   A spokeswoman for Kohlberg Kravis said the firm had no comment.
A spokesman for Maxwell said the British publisher had no comment
on the announcement.
   Financial analysts said a higher offer could appear, but they
disagreed over whether Kohlberg Kravis would drop out of the
bidding.
   Bert Boksen, a media analyst for the investment firm Raymond
James Financial Corp. in St. Petersburg, Fla., said the action
showed the Macmillan board was offering the company to the highest
bidder.
   ``It appears like KKR is not going to increase their bid, and if
somebody can come up with a better bid than Mr. Maxwell's, they
will get the company,'' Boksen said.
   Boksen, who previously estimated Macmillan's worth at about $90
a share, said there still was a chance someone could top Maxwell's
bid.
   Bruce Thorp, media analyst for Provident National Bank in
Philadelphia, said he thought Kohlberg Kravis was inclined to raise
its offer, and could do so by including more securities, which
would complicate comparison of the bid with Maxwell's all-cash
offer. He said a third party may also emerge.
   Macmillan, which has interests that include book publishing and
information services and the Berlitz language and Katherine Gibbs
secretarial schools, has been a takeover target since mid-May when
Texas financier Robert M. Bass proposed a buyout at $64 a share, a
premium over its price at the time of about $51 a share.
   The company proposed a complicated restructuring in late May
that included splitting the company into two separate companies _
publishing and information services _ and giving shareholders a
stake in each along with a cash dividend.
   The Bass Group blocked the restructuring plan by going to court
and subsequently raised its offer for the company to $75 a share
before dropping out of the bidding.
   Maxwell, who has extensive media interests in Britain and is one
of the largest U.S. magazine printers, entered the fray in July
with an $80-a-share offer, boosting it to $86.80 a week ago.
   Maxwell has said he would be willing to drop his bid if he were
allowed to purchase certain Macmillan information services units
for $1.4 billion.

<HEAD>Trial Unlikely For A Year, Evidence Gathering Alone Will Take

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. lawyers want speedy
access to the Securities and Exchange Commission's evidence to
prepare the Wall Street firm's defense against fraud charges, but a
senior SEC lawyer says that process could take months and trial
probably is a year away.
   Thomas Newkirk, the SEC's chief litigation counsel, made the
remarks Thursday, when the first pretrial hearing on evidence
gathering in the Drexel case took place in Manhattan federal court.
   Newkirk told U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack the enforcement
agency must sort through more than 1 million documents to satisfy
defense requests for information. He also said the sorting process
alone means the SEC cannot even deliver those documents until
mid-December.
   Asked later by reporters for his opinion on when the trial
finally could proceed, Newkirk said: ``It will take at least a year
to get ready for trial.''
   The hearing produced no decisions. However, it marked the first
confrontation between Drexel and SEC lawyers in open court since
the agency announced its unprecedented enforcement action Sept. 7
against the investment firm and some key employees, notably
high-yield bond financier Michael Milken.
   The defendants were accused of scheming with now-imprisoned
speculator Ivan Boesky to trade on inside information, manipulate
stock, bully Drexel clients and engage in other securities frauds.
   If they lose, Drexel and the other defendants could face
penalties in the hundreds of millions of dollars and possible
expulsion from the securities business. The firm has denied
wrongdoing.
   The SEC action stemmed directly from revelations by Boesky, who
is cooperating with federal investigators and is expected to be
their star witness in the case.
   The Drexel defense team, comprised of some the most astute and
expensive attorneys in the country, told Pollack it could not even
estimate a trial date until the SEC had supplied at least some of
the documents requested.
   Defense lawyers Arthur Liman and Thomas Curnin also questioned
Pollack's proposal to merge the evidence-gathering processes in the
Drexel case with those in civil suits he is hearing against Boesky.
Liman said that could cause complications and delays.
   ``All we want is our own case,'' Liman said. ``The SEC brought a
case against our clients. We'd like our case to be a separate case
with the SEC.''
   Pollack assured the defense team he was interested in
efficiently completing the evidence-gathering phase and moving to
trial.
   Quickly settling the pretrial fact-gathering issue is crucial to
Drexel's defense strategy because a federal grand jury is
investigating the firm and may deliver an indictment soon, lawyers
familiar with the case have said.
   If that happens, the criminal charges would take precedence over
the SEC's civil charges and severely limit Drexel's ability to seek
evidence, because of stricter federal rules in criminal cases.
   Pollack did not rule on any evidence-gathering guidelines and
set another hearing for Oct. 11.
   At that time, the Drexel defense is expected to ask Pollack to
disqualify himself from the case on grounds it is basically
unrelated to the civil suits against Boesky.
   The SEC had requested that Pollack take the case, bypassing the
normal procedure of random judge selection, on grounds that he is
intimately familiar with the Boesky litigation.
   Pollack, an octogenarian jurist known for his toughness and
pro-government leanings, is expected to reject any defense move to
seek another judge.
   Asked whether the SEC is happy that Pollack appears determined
to remain in charge, Newkirk told reporters, ``we're happy with any
unbiased judge.''

<TEXT>
   In what may be an industry record, Delta Air
Lines has announced orders and options for 215 jets from two
companies in a deal analysts said would be worth at least $6
billion.
   Atlanta-based Delta said it ordered nine MD-11s from McDonnell
Douglas Corp. and nine 767-300ERs from Boeing Co. It also ordered
Pratt & Whitney PW4000-series engines to power the planes, in a
deal worth $1.75 billion.
   The company did not put a value on the options for the remaining
197 aircraft, but analysts said the total would be more than $6
billion. Some put the deal at more than $10 billion, well above the
record $5.04 billion purchase of 100 Boeing and 30 Airbus Industrie
jets last May by International Lease Finance Corp., of Beverly
Hills, Calif.
   ``These new orders and options...highlight our international and
domestic growth plans and commitment to maintaining the most modern
fleet of aircraft available,'' Ron Allen, Delta chairman and chief
executive officer, said in a statement.
   Delta, the nation's third largest airline, also announced
options on 31 more MD-11s, 16 more 767-300ERs, 100 MD-88s and 50
Boeing 757-232s.
   Delta had been known to be contemplating a large order for
months. It did not provide a total cost of the package.
   Spokesman Jim Lundy said Delta chose the MD-11 because of the
nature of the airline's routes in the Pacific, where most of the
planes will be used.
   The twin-engine 767-300ERs _ for ``extended range'' _ will be
used on transatlantic flights, and will carry about 220 passengers.
The MD-11 is a three-engine plane that, in Delta's configuration,
will carry 276 passengers.
   Analyst Robert Decker with Duff & Phelps in Chicago said the
MD-11 order was the first by a domestic airline, but only would
affect other airlines' decision if it caused McDonnell Douglas to
lower the price of the jet.
   Delta operates a fleet of 383 airplanes, and the purchases
announced Thursday will be used for expansion and replacement,
according to spokesman Jim Lundy.
   But the MD-11s generally were intended to expand the airline's
fleet, Lundy said.
   ``Delta's always been one that kept a modern fleet and (the
order) says they're going to maintain their position and that they
intend to keep pace with the growth...in the consolidated
industry,'' said Lee Howard, executive vice president of Airline
Economics Inc., a consulting firm in Washington, D.C.
   The order was the second large purchase for Delta since January
1986, when the Atlanta-based company ordered 80 MD-88s from
McDonnell Douglas and 185 engines from Pratt & Whitney in a deal
worth $2.5 billion.
   Delta said Thursday it still has options remaining on 42
757-200s, 12 767-300s and 85 MD-88s.
   Lundy said the airline had not decided how the new purchases
would be financed, but said the company has a $1 billion line of
bank credit and was in an excellent financial position.
   Delta, which has about 48,000 employees, earned $306.83 million
on $6.92 billion in revenue during the fiscal year ended June 30.
   Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman Tom Cole said the nine
767s would be worth roughly $745 million, including spare parts and
training.
   Howard said the order was just the latest in what already was a
record plane-buying year.
   Boeing now has received orders for 316 767s, including 48 this
year. The company earlier this year set an aircraft-industry record
for planes ordered in one year, and the Delta order boosts that to
485 planes worth about $22 billion, Cole said.
   At a price of about $44 million apiece, the 50 757s would be
worth about $2.2 billion, if all orders are exercised, Cole said.
The 16 767-300ERs would be worth approximately $1.15 billion. Spare
parts and training could increase those figures.
   McDonnell Douglas spokesman Don Hanson said his company does not
release price information about its planes. Industry experts
estimate an MD-11, a successor to the DC-10, costs about $100
million, and a 142-passenger MD-88 costs about $25 million. At
those prices, the 40 MD-11s would be worth $4 billion, and the 100
MD-88s $2.5 billion.
   The first 767s will be delivered to Delta in early 1990, with
the initial MD-11s delivered to Delta in the spring of 1991.

<HEAD>Dingell Says He's Less Than Satisfied With SEC Decision On WPPSS
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee says he's not happy with the Securities and Exchange
Commission's decision not to pursue enforcement action in the
largest municipal bond default in history.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., said the SEC's decision in the $2.25
billion bond default by the Washington Public Power Supply System
``is not well received by WPPSS bondholders or by me.
   ``Investors in municipal securities have the same right to
accurate and full disclosure as any other investors and liability
should fall firmly on those who defraud them,'' Dingell said.
   Dingell said the SEC's plans to terminate the WPPSS
investigation ``will be looked at and addressed vigorously by the
committee at the earliest possible time.''
   In a massive report released Thursday, the commission's staff
laid out a ``factual'' account of the supply system's problems in
trying to build two nuclear power plants in Washington state but
drew no legal conclusions.
   The report found, in general, that WPPSS tried to put the best
image possible on the deepening construction and financial problems
that led up to the default in 1983 and in some cases ``avoided
disclosure of negative developments.''
   Others, including the bond underwriters, bond counsel and the
rating agencies, were not agressive enough in asking questions and
exercising ``due diligence'' to ensure that investors were aware of
the supply system's mounting problems, the report stated.
   SEC Chairman David Ruder said that while he was ``very concerned
about the failure of the system'' in the sale of the WPPSS bonds, a
prolonged enforcement action would be a drain on the commission's
resources.
   Ruder also said it would be difficult to determine who was
responsible for ``deficiencies'' in the bond's disclosure reports,
and that bondholders already were trying to recover their
investments through a civil trial currently underway in Tucson.
   The commission did decide to offer for public comment a proposed
rule that would impose stricter disclosure requirements on issuers
of municipal bonds and the securities firms that sell them.
   Oregon Democratic Rep. Ron Wyden, a member of the House Energy
Committee, said he was concerned the SEC is indicating it doesn't
have the money and staff to pursue such massive cases.
   ``It sends a message that if you mess up, mess up big because
the principal regulatory agency doesn't have the resources to
pursue enforcement action,'' said Wyden.
   The SEC report concluded the default resulted from extensive
cost overruns and construction delays at WPPSS Projects No. 4 and
No. 5 in Washington state.
   Cost of the projects had soared from an initial estimate of
slightly over $2 billion to almost $12 billion before construction
was halted in 1981.
   Both projects were abandoned in January 1982 and in 1983 WPPSS
quit making payments on the bonds after the Washington state
Supreme Court held that the utilities' contracts with the
consortium were illegal and thus unenforceable. Without payments
from the 88 participating utilities, many in other states, WPPSS
defaulted.
   As early as 1978, the report said, WPPSS recognized it could
face long-term financing problems. Top supply system officials told
the 88 utilities participating in the projects in late 1980 that
WPPSS' ``cash flow coverage was so low that there was almost none
at times,'' the report said.
   The report said the participants, also in late 1980, asked the
supply system to study the possibility of slowing down construction
or terminating the two projects.
   The request was kept confidential because of its possible impact
on the financial markets and WPPSS contiuned to sell bonds, more
than $400 million worth, before the projects were scrubbed, the
report said.
   The report found that WPPSS also failed to adequately disclose
in the official bond statements that forecasts showed a drop in the
demand for electricity in the Northwest.
   As for others involved in the WPPSS bond sales, the report said:
   _Underwriters were aware of the supply system's problems but did
not conduct ``due diligence-type'' investigations to verify WPPSS's
disclosure reports as they do with other securities sales.
   The underwriters contend they had no legal obligation to conduct
an investigation and it was not industry practice to do so in
competitive municipal bond sales.
   _WPPSS's bond counsel and special counsel, despite ``indications
of legal difficulties'' with provisions requiring the utilities to
pay for the plants whether they were finished or not gave the bonds
a clean bill of health.
   _Rating agencies depended too much on information supplied by
WPPSS and did too little study of their own in rating the bonds.

<HEAD>Securities Group, Brokers Sue State Over New Regulation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of brokerage firms and an industry
association are going to court to try to block a new state
regulation that would guarantee investors the right to sue their
stockbrokers.
   Nine major brokerage houses and the Securities Industry
Association filed the federal lawsuit Thursday, contending the
regulation is unconstitutional.
   ``If the federal government were going to do this, it might be
unwise and unnecessary, but for states to do it, it's also
unconstitutional,'' said Gerald F. Rath, an attorney for the
plaintiffs.
   The regulation would forbid stockbrokers from asking their
clients to sign agreements to submit all disputes to binding
arbitration. Many brokerage firms, alarmed by a rash of lawsuits
after the October 19, 1987, stock market crash, have began
requesting such agreements from all new clients.
   Massachusetts is the first state to propose a regulation against
the practice, but 16 other states reportedly may adopt similar
rules. A U.S. House subcommittee also is considering legislation
that would bar brokerage houses from requiring customers to sign
arbitration agreements before opening accounts.
   If upheld by the courts, the Massachusetts regulation will take
effect Jan. 1, 1989.
   State officials, who unveiled the regulation Thursday in
Washington, said they anticipated the legal challenge.
   ``We're very confident that we are on firm constitutional
ground,'' said Deputy Secretary of State Martin T. Meehan. ``We've
been working with the attorney general's office for months, and we
expect to win in court.''
   Meehan said the anti-arbitration guidelines were intended to
give investors the option of suing brokers in the event of a
dispute and were drafted because state officials received hundreds
of complaints from investors after the October crash.
   Most brokerage firms require customers to settle disputes
through an arbitration hearing sponsored by the New York Stock
Exchange, the National Association of Securities Dealers or other
market organizations.
   Arbitration generally is cheaper and faster than suing, but
investors have only a limited right to appeal. While big
institutional investors can negotiate contracts with brokerages,
individual investors usually have little choice but to agree to
arbitration.
   The lawsuit asks for an injunction against the regulation and
names Secretary of State Michael Connolly and state Securities
Division Director Barry C. Guthary as defendants.
   The suit contends arbitration agreements are consistent with the
1934 Securities and Exchange Act and that the 1925 Federal
Arbitration Act took away from states the power to pass legislation
governing such agreements.
   Under the new regulation, stockbrokers could have have their
licenses suspended or revoked if they refused to accept an
investor's business without an arbitration agreement.
   By doing that, the suit claims, ``the Massachusetts
anti-arbitration regulations purport to place arbitration
agreements on a different footing from other agreements.''
   Meehan, the deputy secretary of state, disagreed. ``We're not
claiming that the contract is illegal,'' he said. ``We're also not
claiming to have the authority to get into the reform of
arbitration mechanics. But we clearly have the right to give
investors the choice as to whether or not they are forced to enter
into these agreements.''
   The nine brokerage houses that filed the suit are:
   Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.; Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette
Securities Corp.; Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.; Fidelity Brokerage
Services Inc.; Kidder Peabody & Co.; Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner
& Smith Inc.; PaineWebber Inc.; Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.;
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.; and Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   A Securities and Exchange Commission survey this year of 65
firms handling 90 percent of all customer accounts found virtually
all require arbitration, particularly for customers who borrow
money from the firm through margin accounts or trade in risky stock
options.
   But the Securities Industry Assocation said that since 1981 the
SEC has received more than 156,000 complaints by private investors
against brokers and only 147 involved arbitration.

   Republicans stalling action on a bill to raise
the $3.35 minimum wage are vowing to continue their filibuster
until Democrats accede to an 80 percent subminimum for any newly
hired employee.
   A vote on a second Democratic attempt to break the filibuster
was scheduled today. While GOP leaders conceded that some support
for their delay tactics may be wavering, others vowed to continue
the parliamentary fight, if necessary, until Congress adjourns in
mid-October.
   On a 53-43 vote _ six short of the 60 needed _ the Senate
refused Thursday to limit to 30 hours further debate on the bill by
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., to raise the wage floor to $3.75
an hour in January, $4.15 in 1990 and $4.55 in 1991.
   ``I hope that our friends on the other side of the aisle will
have a change of heart overnight,'' Senate Majority Leader Robert
C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said after the vote. ``It's only clear that there
is a deliberate attempt to stall action on this bill.''
   The stalemate has existed since Sept. 17 when Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, filed an amendment that would establish a 90-day subminimum
rate at the current floor of $3.35 an hour for new hires. The
subminium would be raised to $3.65 an hour in 1991.
   President Reagan, Vice President George Bush and Bush's running
mate, Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., all have demanded that any increase
in the minimum wage be coupled with the creation of a subminimum.
   While Bush, Quayle and Hatch have referred to the proposal as a
``training'' wage or a ``youth training'' wage, Hatch's amendment
does not have the word ``training'' in it, nor any age limitations
on its application.
   Immediately after Hatch's amendment was introduced, Kennedy
filed a substitute for it that would slightly expand a currently
allowed but little-used 85 percent subminimum wage for full-time
students working less than 20 hours a week.
   Because Hatch's subminimum proposal would die under the Senate's
rules if Kennedy's is approved, Republicans have refused to allow
votes on it or any other amendments.
   ``They don't want to vote on the Kennedy amendment because it
will prevail and they don't like that,'' Kennedy said. He said it
would represent ``a vote against the plan that Bush hatched.''
   Bush in the past two weeks has said he supports an increase in
the minimum wage _ never specifying how much _ but only if it is
accompanied by a subminimum floor.
   Quayle has repeatedly advocated an increase to $4 an hour over
two years coupled with a subminimum.
   ``We're not going to get a fair hearing on the training wage
because the labor leaders don't want it,'' complained Senate
Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas. ``It's not the Republicans
vs. the Demorats; it's the Republicans vs. the labor leaders.
They're telling us we can take this or leave; we're not going to
play that game.''
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said Republicans ``obviously
know that the presidential nominee of their party, George Bush,
wasn't serious when he told Americans he wanted an increase in the
minimum wage.''
   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., said Bush could break the logjam with
``seven phone calls'' to Republican senators supporting the
filibuster.
   Kennedy predicted the bill's supporters would pick up additional
support on today's cloture vote but maybe not enough to break the
logjam.
   ``It's an open secret that the White House has asked the
Republicans to keep voting for a filibuster tomorrow and next
week,'' he said.
   Dole conceded that some members of his party might bolt today,
saying, ``We might not be successful, but we're going to try.''
   Other Republicans, however, vowed to continue the fight, if
necessary, until Congress adjourns.
   ``We could very well be on this bill for the remaining month,''
said Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho. ``We don't have the votes to repeal
the minimum wage, which is what we should be doing at a time of
economic expansion.''
   On Thursday's vote, three Republicans _ Sens. Lowell Weicker of
Connecticut, William Roth of Delaware and John Chafee of Rhode
Island _ joined 50 Democrats to end the filibuster.
   Three Democrats _ Sens. James Exon of Nebraska, David Boren of
Oklahoma and Richard Shelby of Alabama _ joined Republicans in
voting then to allow it to continue.

   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 1
point, or 0.06 percent, at 1,789.7 at about 12:30 p.m. local time.
   Volume came to 218.4 million shares, down from 231.3 million

<HEAD>West German Minister Rejects Call For Debt Forgiveness</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with West German finance minister
rejecting call for debt forgiveness. No pickup. A version moving on

<TEXT>
   The West German finance minister today rejected
even partial debt forgiveness for heavily indebted, middle-income
countries, despite the urging of the head of the International
Monetary Fund.
   But the minister, Gerhard Stoltenberg, also said he expected
that other major nations would join West Germany in reducing
interest rates on the massive debts owed by some poorer countries.
   ``There is no cause to discuss debt forgiveness'' for the
middle-income countries, Stoltenberg told reporters on the second
day of discussions leading up to the formal annual joint meetings
of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund next week.
   Countries whose people have average incomes above $750 a year
are considered middle-income countries. Brazil is the most heavily
indebted of these, owing $121 billion, followed by Mexico and
Argentina. The World Bank says the Third World debt burden at the
end of 1987 was $1.2 trillion.
   On Thursday, Michael Camdessus, chief of the International
Monetary Fund, urged industrial nations to write off some debts of
developing countries for the good of both groups. ``There is no
prosperity for the industrial countries without prosperity for the
developing countries,'' Camdessus told reporters.
   Camdessus spoke at the opening of international banking talks as
thousands of police patrolled West Berlin to prevent violence
during demonstrations planned by bank critics. They charge that
Third World countries are crushed under the weight of their debt to
wealthier nations.
   Fears of violence grew Tuesday when two masked men armed with at
least one shotgun fired at Hans Tietmeyer. The shots missed the
official of the West German Finance Ministry who helped plan the
international banking talks.
   Stoltenberg also said he opposes any suggestions for a worldwide
debt forgiveness. ``Calls for a global solution destroy the
creditworthiness of debtor countries,'' Stoltenberg said.
   He said debt problems should be solved on a case-by-case basis
and West Germany would rather restructure debt and improve
conditions than forgive loans. The West German government this week
announced additional concessions to the poorest countries. ``We
have verbal indications that the British and French governments
will make similar decisions,'' he said.
   Stoltenberg also said major industrial nations such as the
United States should strive for a closer alignment of their
economic policies, and that he wants to avoid ``strong swings in
foreign exchange rates.''
   The West German finance minister said he met Thursday with the
new U.S. treasury secretary, Nicholas Brady. He declined to go into
details on the talks, but said he expected U.S. economic policies
to remain unchanged.
   Stoltenberg is scheduled to meet with Brady and the top finance
officials from the five other major Western industrialized nations
on Saturday.
   Finance ministers from 24 developing countries are slated to
meet as well on Saturday and are expected to seek more aid from
governments as well as from commercial banks. They are also seeking
a cancellation of some debts.
   Delegates from the 151 World Bank and IMF member countries as
well as representatives of banking and industry have been arriving
all week for the West Berlin discussions.
   The talks culminate with the Sept. 27-29 joint meeting of the
two sister organizations, which lend money to governments for
development projects.

   Chrysler Corp. introduced its 1989
cars and trucks Thursday, and a top executive said the company has
a tough task in holding its share of the market.
   ``We're going to struggle to hold car share,'' said Gerald
Greenwald, chairman of the company's Chrysler Motors car-making
arm. ``We are going through a transition year of dropping some of
the old'' models.
   He said the truck market should not be a problem. ``We don't see
any strong competition on our minivan,'' he said.
   Chrysler opened the minivan market in the early 1980s with its
Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager, both front-wheel drive
vehicles. Since then, other domestic and foreign makers have jumped
into the rapidly expanding market, but Chrysler's two models have
held the market lead.
   ``We see us holding our own, maybe a little plus,'' Greenwald
said.
   During the past several years, the No. 3 U.S. automaker has lost
market share in cars while gaining in light trucks.
   During the same period, it has dealt with the acquisition of
American Motors Corp. While AMC brought employees that sometimes
performed redundant work of their Chrysler counterparts, the
acquisition brought hot-selling Jeep vehicles to the Chrysler
lineup.
   ``God bless minivans and Jeeps,'' said Ben Bidwell, president
for products and marketing for Chrysler Motors. ``We're going to
have to stretch to equal the '88 volume and (market) share.''
   At the end of last month, Chrysler held 14.3 percent of the
U.S.-made car market and 22.7 percent of the domestically made
light truck market.
   The major changes for 1989 include a new four-speed automatic
transmission, called Ultradrive; a 2.5-liter, four-cylinder engine;
and antilock braking systems on more vehicles, including all four
wheels on the Jeep Cherokee.
   Company executives also repeated that more Chrysler cars have
air bags as standard equipment than any other automaker and that by
the 1990 model year, air bags will be standard on U.S.-built cars.
   Later in the '89 model year, Chrysler will introduce the
mid-size '89 Acclaim and the 1990 Laser, designed to compete with
the Ford Probe and other cars.

   USX Corp. said Thursday it will not sell its
shuttered Texas plate mill to Iraq because a letter of intent had
expired without a contract for final sale.
   The USX mill, which is located in Baytown and once employed
about 2,000 workers, has been idle for two years.
   ``At this time, there are no commitments for the sale to Iraq or
any other party,'' the steelmaker said in a statement.
   USX Chairman David M. Roderick said he agreed to a request by
Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, whose district includes the plant, not
to contract for another sale to Iraq for at least six months.
   Birmingham Steel Corp. of Birmingham, Ala., has said it was
interested in buying the plant if the Iraqi deal fell through.
Birmingham Steel and an unnamed group were reported to have offered
$115 million for the building and equipment, while Iraq offered
$100 million.
   But USX spokesman William P. Ryder said Birmingham Steel had not
made a formal offer for the plant.
   The sale of the mill to Iraq sparked sharp criticism from a
number of sectors including lawmakers and the United Steelworkers
Union of America.
   Rep. Jack Fields, R-Texas, argued that the deal would reduce
American steel-making capability and increase domestic steel prices.
   Fields said Iraq's ambassador to the United States, Abdul-Amir
al-Anbari, had told him a $1 million down payment had been made to
USX, but the steelmaker denied it had received any money.

<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sheldon Coleman, chairman of the board of
the Coleman Co. and son of its founder, has died at the age of 86.
   Coleman, who died Wednesday night, joined his father's company
in 1925 shortly after being graduated from Cornell University with
a mechanical engineering degree. He became Coleman Co. chief
executive officer and executive vice president in October, 1940 and
its chairman in 1957.
   His son, Sheldon C. Coleman, is the company's president.
   The publicly held company that had record sales of nearly $600
million and more than 5,000 employees in 1987 was founded by W.C.
Coleman in 1900 in Kingfisher, Okla. as a lighting-service
business, leasing lamps and servicing them.
   In 1901, the business moved to Wichita, where it began producing
lamps in 1905. It developed its Coleman lanterns, which lengthened
the farmer's day, in 1914.
   In 1920s, the company prospered. But the Coleman family almost
lost the company during the Great Depression.
   Coleman saw rural electrification coming and recommended the
company diversify by developing oil space heaters and gas floor
furnaces in the 1930s.
   During the 1960s Coleman led another diversification effort,
expanding the company's lantern and camp stove production into
dozens of outdoor recreation products. The company eventually
became the world's largest manufacturer of such items.
   A funeral is scheduled for 3 p.m. Saturday at Wichita's
Metropolitan Baptist Church. A Memorial has been established with
the Coleman Chairtable Trust.
   Besides his son, Coleman's survivors include his wife, Galey; a
brother, Clarence; two daughters, two stepsons, a stepdaughter, 14
grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.

<HEAD>New Ecuadoran Government Says It Wants Foreign Investment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>QUITO, Ecuador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new center-left government said
Thursday it welcomes foreign investment and was concerned its
recent decision to assume operating control of much of the nation's
oil industry would be misinterpreted as a nationalization.
   Energy Minister Diego Tamariz met with foreign correspondents to
stress that the decision to assume operating control of various
stages of production and refining over the next several years did
not mean the government has ``the intention of taking action
against the assets of foreign companies through nationalizing
them.''
   The government said earlier this week that the state oil company
CEPE would assume control next year of the pipeline, which brings
oil from the eastern jungle, when the pipeline service contract
with U.S. oil company Texaco Inc. ends in 1989.
   It said CEPE would take control of production wells now operated
by Texaco when production contracts end in 1990 and also would buy
two refineries owned by private investors.
   ``We are worried that this may create an image abroad that we do
not want foreign investment in the country when in fact we are open
to foreign investment in terms of mutual benefit,'' Tamariz said.
   The government has said it would respect oil exploration
contracts that the previous government of conservative President
Leon Febres Cordero signed with 13 foreign companies.
   ``The principal concern is that the image we have given is not
real. That is to say, the image of a government nationalizing when
we are taking control of operations that correspond to the state
company under contract terms,'' Tamariz said.
   Texaco produces nearly 80 percent of Ecuador's daily output of
310,000 barrels.
   President Rodrigo Borja, a moderate leftist, took office Aug. 10
pledging to impose controls on the free-market economic system

that he also would be more selective than his predecessor about

   A San Francisco health care executive and nine
other people were charged with defrauding employee benefit plans in
Atlanta, Chicago and the state of California, the Justice
Department said Thursday.
   Angelo Commito, a health care service provider and consultant to
employee benefit plans, was charged in Atlanta in a scheme to
defraud the Munford Corp., a retailer, in connection with the award
of a pre-paid optical benefit program for the company's employees.
   Commito, of Palm Desert, Calif., was arrested Thursday by FBI
agents as he arrived at the Palm Springs, Calif., Municipal
Airport, said spokesman Jim Neilson of the FBI's Los Angeles office.
   In an indictment unsealed in Baltimore, Commito, United
HealthCare Inc. and United's vice president for marketing, Alan
Cohn of Owings Mills, Md., were accused of devising a scheme to pay
a government agent who posed as Munford's agent for selecting the
optical program.
   United's president and chief operating officer, Bill Slavin,
said his company was ``innocent of all charges.'' United provides
prepaid optical, dental and medical prescription services to more
than a million families in 42 states.
   Two indictments unsealed in Atlanta accused Commito and five
other people of conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud and money
laundering in a plan to defraud Munford and its employee welfare
plan in the selection of a second pre-paid optical program and an
alcohol and drug abuse counseling program. The plan allegedly
involved using Commito's companies to pay a government agent who
posed as Munford's representative for the purchase of the programs.
   One of two indictments issued in Chicago accused Commito and
Carl Mattison, 64, of Aptos, Calif., of conspiracy, paying
kickbacks to an employee pension plan official and embezzlement of
pension fund money in changing life insurance carriers for
employees in a pension fund.
   The fund was for members of Service Employees International
Union 1. William Wire, 52, former manager of the fund, was charged
with conspiracy, receipt of kickbacks, embezzlement and concealing
the kickbacks, resulting in the filing of a false report with the
U.S. Labor Department.
   Also charged in Chicago was William Hainsworth, 45, of Winfield,
Ill., former administrator of the Welfare Fund sponsored by the
DuPage County, Ill., Cement Masons Union. Hainsworth was accused of
embezzling welfare fund money, falsifying fund records and making
false statements to a grand jury.
   The grand jury investigated a plan in which Hainsworth allegedly
concealed his execution of dental and optical care contracts that
weren't disclosed to fund trustees and participating employees. One
of the contracts involved a company operated by Commito, Labor and
Health Benefit Plans Inc.
   In San Diego, Commito and three other people were accused of
defrauding Eye Care U.S.A. of money used to establish two optical
care companies in which Commito and one of the other defendants,
Elliott Kusel, held financial interests.
   In San Francisco, Commito and Mattison were accused of
conspiring to violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organization statute and embezzlement and kickbacks in connection
with employee benefits plan funds.
   Commito and Mattison were charged with embezzlement and
unlawfully receiving kickbacks in connection with the selection of
an alcohol and drug abuse rehabilitation program for people
participating in the Western Employers Trust, a welfare benefit
plan for employees in central and northern California. The two were
accused of stealing benefit plan money that was added to the cost
of the program in order to generate unlawful fees.
   Commito and Mattison also were accused of devising a scheme to
defraud the National Semiconductor Corp. of Santa Clara, Calif., of
money the two allegedly agreed would be used to pay kickbacks to a
government undercover agent who posed as the company
representative. The kickbacks were to persuade the firm to buy an
alcohol and drug rehabilitation program.
   Commito appeared before U.S. Magistrate George L. Marin in Yucca
Valley, Calif., where bail was set at $1 million. Commito posted a
$100,000 deposit and was released, the FBI's Neilson said.
   Also charged in the Atlanta indictments were Mattison; Monica
Oss, 32, of Washington, D.C.; Elliott Kusel, 54, of San Diego; Marc
Lee Kusel, 30, of Mission Viejo, Calif.; and Thomas Parnham, 39, of
Reston, Va.
   Also charged in the San Diego indictment were the two Kusels and
Cheryl Fyten, former vice president of personnel at Eye Care
U.S.A., a San Diego optical service provider.

<HEAD>Encyclopaedia Britannica Says Taipei Court Upholds Ownership
Rights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc., said Thursday that
a Taiwan court has found a book company in that country and two of
its officials guilty of pirating Britannica's published works.
   In a statement, the Chicago-based Britannica said the Criminal
Division of the Taipei District Court returned guilty verdicts
Tuesday against the Tan Ching Book Company, its president, Tu
Chich-hsiang and its chairman, Chang Yu-ping, for pirating the
10-volume Concise Encyclopaedia Britannica.
   The CEB, first published in Beijing, is a condensed Chinese
translation of Britannica's Micropaedia, the ready-reference
section of Encyclopaedia Britannica's 15th Edition, the company
said.
   Tu and Chang each was sentenced to one year in prison and fined,
Britannica said.
   ``We are gratified that the Taiwan court has upheld Britannica's
ownership rights and respected its copyright by enforcing Taiwan
law,'' said Frank Gibney, vice president of Britannica's Board of
Editors, in the statement.
   ``This is a great step forward in protecting intellectual
property rights on an international level throughout the Pacific
Basin,'' he said.
   Last year, the company charged the Tan Ching Book Company with
producing an unauthorized Chinese-language edition of the
Britannica. The publisher not only refused to stop production, but
advertised the edition heavily in Taiwan newspapers, Britannica
said.
   Britannica filed a complaint against Tan Ching in February, and
Taiwan police conducted a raid in which more than 56,000 bindings
and thousands of complete volumes of a pirated verision of the
Chinese-language CEB were seized.
   Britannica reached agreement in late 1987 with Chung Hwa Book
Company of Taipei to publish the authorized version of the CEB in
Taiwan, the company said, and Chung Hwa already has issued five
volumes of the 20-volume CEB.

<HEAD>Testimony Begins In Mammoth WPPSS Trial</HEAD>

   Representatives of several utilities helped
guide a failed attempt to build two nuclear power plants that led
to a historic bond default by the Washington Public Power Supply
System, according to the opening witness at Thursday's fraud trial
stemming from the default.
   The utility representatives served on boards and committees that
decided there was a need for more power, approved the projects and
drew up the agreements under which 88 public utilities would
participate in building the plants and sharing the power, said
WPPSS employee Harlan R. Kosmata.
   WPPSS defaulted on $2.25 billion in municipal bonds, the largest
such default in U.S. history, when the Washington Supreme Court
ruled in 1983 that the public utilities had no authority to sign
those participation agreements.
   A class of 24,000 bondholders and Chemical Bank of New York, a
trustee for bondholders, are suing 15 utilities, two engineering
firms and a financial company for fraud.
   Attorneys for the bondholders have maintained the defendants
conspired to lie and withhold information in order to sell the
bonds. Had that information been revealed, they contend, the bonds
never would have been sold.
   They have also maintained the utilities wielded power over WPPSS
to build the plants.
   Kosmata, under questioning by Chemical Bank attorney Thomas
Barr, noted many of the same employees of the utilities either were
elected or appointed to several panels that had decision power over
the projects.
   Kosmata was liaison between WPPSS and the utilities in the
projects. He also was secretary for the participants committee, a
group of seven people that made decisions for all the utilities in
the projects.
   Representatives for several large utilities, including
defendants Tacoma and Snohomish County, sat on the participants
committee and also were members of the WPPSS board of directors,
the WPPSS executive committee and the Public Power Council, an
organization of public utilities in the Northwest, Kosmata said.
   All of them were involved in deciding when, how and where the
plants would be built and how the financing would occur, he
testified.
   Kosmata said the WPPSS board of directors consisted of people
representing and chosen by utility members.
   The board ``acted on significant issues'' concerning the plants,
he said. ``In layman's terms, it did have control of the supply
system.''
   Kosmata testified for the plaintiffs and was expected to resume
his testimony Monday.
