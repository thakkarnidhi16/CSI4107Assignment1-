<HEAD>France Lifts Embargo on Iranian Crude Oil</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France has lifted its 15-month embargo on imports of
crude oil from Iran, once its largest oil supplier.
   The Industry Ministry informed oil companies operating in France
on Friday that imports of Iranian crude are henceforth subject to
the usual French regulations governing oil imports.
   France severed its diplomatic relations with Iran following the
``Embassy War'' in the summer of 1987 when the Iranian Embassy in
Paris refused to allow Wahid Gordji, an interpreter without
diplomatic status, to be interrogated by a French judge in
connection with terrorist attacks in Paris in September 1986.
   The French police blocked off the embassy and the Iranians
retaliated by preventing French diplomats in Tehran from leaving
their embassy. Gordji and the French consul in Tehran were
eventually exchanged in November 1987.
   The embargo was partially lifted Sept. 9 when France resumed
normal diplomatic relations with Iran.
   Oil industry officials said the partial lifting of the embargo
did not have any practical effect because it simply involved giving
authorization to French oil companies on a case-by-case basis to do
barter deals involving Iranian crude.
   The barter deals were negotiated by French trading houses and
involved exchanges of French food and farm products, notably sugar
and meat, for Iranian crude.
   Industry sources said none of the barter deals was ever
concluded, however, because the Iranian asking price was felt to be
too high in view of the bearishness of the oil market at the time.
   Latest oil industry statistics show no imports of Iranian crude
by France in the first nine months of this year.
   France imported 4.4 million tons of Iranian crude during the
first eight months of 1987. Imports totalled 2.9 million tons in
1986.
   Jean-Louis Breuil-Jarrige, president of the French oil industry
association, wrote to Industry Minister Roger Fauroux in June after
diplomatic relations were restored to point out that the embargo was
having no real effect.
   He argued that French refiners were importing petroleum products
made from Iranian crude imported by other European refiners. French
oil companies also pointed out at the time that they had a
competitive disadvantage compared with European counterparts because
Iran was selling its crude relatively cheaply.

<HEAD>General Assembly Votes For Historic Protest Session To Hear Arafat
In Geneva</HEAD>

   The General Assembly slapped its host
country with an unprecedented rebuke by voting 154-2 to reconvene in
Geneva so PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, barred from the United States,
can address the delegates.
   The resolution adopted Friday ``deplores'' the United States'
refusal to grant Arafat a visa.
   ``Once again, within hours, the international body in this
community has stood together for what is right against what is
wrong,'' said PLO envoy Zuhdi Labib Terzi.
   Only the United States and Israel voted against the
Arab-sponsored resolution. Britain abstained, having previously said
the criticism in the resolution was too harsh.
   Members of Palestine Liberation Organization, ``who specialized
in hijacking of airplanes and cruise ships, are expanding their
efforts and hijacking the General Assembly,'' said Israel's acting
ambassador, Johanan Bein.
   U.S. Ambassador Herbert S. Okun, the acting U.S. representative,
said the move was unnecessary. The United States contended that
another PLO delegate could present Arafat's viewpoints.
   But the highest ranking U.S. official at the United Nations sided
with critics, saying Washington's action had done ``incalculable
damage to the United States credibility in the world arena.''
   The comments were written by Joseph V. Reed,
undersecretary-general for General Assembly affairs, in a letter to
President Reagan.
   The assembly took the historic step of moving to the U.N.'s
European headquarters because the United States rejected U.N.
appeals to admit Arafat, who last visited New York in 1974.
   Okun said the United States didn't object to the move and would
participate in debate there.
   Arafat wants to address the 159-nation assembly to explain the
PLO's declaration of an independent state and its implicit
recognition of Israel. The Palestinian issue will be discussed Dec.
13-15 in Geneva.
   It will be the first session the United Nations has convened
outside New York since moving into its building in Manhattan in 1952.
   Okun said the United States was justified in denying a visa to
Arafat, whom the Reagan administration called an ``accessory to
terrorism.''
   Critics said the U.S. action violated the 1947 U.N. Headquarters
Agreement, under which the United States is obligated to grant visas
to U.N. diplomats and guests.
   The United Nations has estimated the cost of the Geneva session
at $645,500, including $159,000 for first-class round-trip tickets
to Geneva for delegates of the world's 40 poorest countries.
   Since 1946, the United Nations has paid travel expenses of the
least developed nations so they can be represented in deliberations.
   The cost also includes travel for at least 30 U.N. officials and
staff, translation and documentation in six official languages and
other expenses.
   On Wednesday, the assembly overwhelmingly denounced the U.S.
denial of a visa to Arafat and gave the United States 24 hours to
reconsider.
   Again, only the United States and Israel voted against the
resolution. Britain abstained.
   On Thursday night, the U.S. government said it would not change
its position. The resolution to move to Geneva was introduced early
Friday.
   In his letter to Reagan, written after the Wednesday vote, Reed
said the State Department position ``is baffling and contradictory
because Chairman Arafat has already addressed the General Assembly,
in 1974, and thus set a precedent for being granted an entry visa.''
   Dominica was not present for Friday's vote, and South Africa has
not had voting rights since 1974 because of its policy of apartheid.

<TEXT>
   A retired General Services Administration
official faces a maximum 36-year prison term when he's sentenced
Feb. 3 for receiving $24,185 in bribes to provide inside information
to two businessmen who were found guilty of conspiracy.
   Lester H. Finotti Jr., 56, a former manager in GSA's
transportation audit branch, was convicted by a U.S. District Court
jury of receiving the money and the use of a luxury automobile
during an 18-month period ending in September 1986.
   William H. White Sr., 59, and Carmine W. DePietro, 53, the former
president and former executive vice president, respectively, of
Southern Investment Co., were convicted of conspiracy to defraud the
government.
   The charge carries a five-year term.
   The three defendants were allowed to remain free on bond until
their sentencing Feb. 3 by U.S. District Judge Harold Greene.
   The scheme involved an effort to obtain inside information from
GSA to help the Fayetteville, N.C., company, which purchased
bills-of-lading at a discount from moving companies that hauled
furniture of government employees.
   Under the arrangement known as factoring, the moving companies in
effect paid Southern Investment a premium to receive their money
faster than if they waited for the government to pay them directly.
   Southern Investment, in turn, assumed total liability for any
claims for damaged freight that the government filed against the
trucking companies.
   The prosecution presented evidence that Finotti provided
information about the reliability of freight haulers that enabled
White and DePietro to decide whether to factor a company's
bills-of-lading.
   Such information would enable Southern Investment to avoid
purchasing moving bills from companies that would likely incur large
damage claims, the prosecution contended.
   The indictment charged that Finotti manipulated the payment of
bills-of-lading to benefit Southern Investment.
   Finotti, of Waldorf, Md., was convicted of conspiracy, bribery,
conflict-of-interest, and filing a false government financial
disclosure statement that did not report his financial arrangement
with Southern Investment Co.

<HEAD>More Than 200 Soviet Jews, Armenians Denied Admission As Refugees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. authorities have refused to grant refugee
status to more than 200 Soviet Jews and Armenians, but a State
Department official says they could be eligible to enter this
country through a system known as parole.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said Friday that the
would-be refugees were unable to demonstrate ``a well-founded fear
of persecution.'' But one way or another, he said, ``we continue to
admit all Soviet Jewish applicants who choose to come to the United
States.''
   The issue was raised by the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews.
The private group released two petitions from Soviet Jews in Italy
awaiting entrance visas to the United States.
   Most Jews who are permitted to leave the Soviet Union have exit
permits to emigrate to Israel. But an overwhelming majority choose
to go to the United States after they reach Rome or Vienna.
   Redman said of more than 4,000 applications in Rome in October
and November, less than 200 were found not to qualify for refugees
status. But, he said, ``if this occurs, the applicants are, without
exception, given the opportunity to apply for parole.''
   To be granted parole, the U.S. official said, applicants must
show they would be supported by a relative or a sponsor in the event
jobs were not found. The idea is to avoid additional U.S. welfare
costs.
   Entering as a refugee provides certain benefits that are not
available under parole. These include transportation expenses, some
support for resettlement and access to Medicaid.
   In Moscow, he said, 99 applicants, most of whom were Armenians,
did not qualify for refugee status during the two months. But,
Redman said, they also may seek admission under the parole system.
   Redman said there was no change in U.S. policy.
   ``The United States continues to call for freedom of emigration
for all and continues to admit all Soviet Jewish applicants who
choose to come to the United States,'' he said. ``Most qualify as
refugees, and in addition some enter as parolees.''

   Fire raced through the attic of a downtown
motel late Friday night, leaving guests homeless, causing minor
injuries to three people and gutting the top floor of the two-story
building, officials said.
   The fire was reported at 11:30 p.m., Fire Chief Don Werner said.
Werner said he didn't know how many guests were evacuated from the
Village Inn Motel, but said the fire gutted at least 26 rooms.
   A woman who jumped from a second-story balcony was treated for a
minor ankle injury and smoke inhalation, and two people were treated
for smoke inhalation, said a paramedic who refused to give his name.
   A number of people lost belongings to the blaze, Werner said.
   The fire began in a corner of the U-shaped motel, and moved
through the attic around the building.
   All the rooms on the top floor suffered heavy fire damage, and
most of the room beneath sustained water and smoke damage, officials
said.
   About 60 Columbus firefighters responded to the blaze, which sent
smoke over several blocks of the city's old German Village
neighborhood.
   Residents of a nearby apartment complex were evacuated as a
precaution because of the smoke, Werner said.

   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and his wife,
Raisa, have accepted an invitation from developer Donald Trump to
visit his glitzy Fifth Avenue shopping atrium when they come to town
next week.
   The Gorbachevs are expected to spend about a half-hour next

by the multimillionaire, Trump spokesman Dan Klores said Friday.
   Gorbachev is coming to New York to meet with President Ronald
Reagan and President-elect George Bush.
   Klores said Trump met Gorbachev at a White House dinner during
the Soviet leader's last visit to the United States earlier this

coming, he (Trump) wrote him a note,'' Klores said.
   ``On Wednesday, the Soviets responded and said they'd be
delighted to come.''

   Richard Nixon's daughter and
supporters broke ground for his presidential library, predicting
history would treat him favorably.
   Julie Nixon Eisenhower and others among the 1,000 dignitaries and
guests at Friday's ceremony looked forward to a library that will
offer a glimpse of the man who debated Soviet leader Nikita
Khrushchev and went on to oversee the dawn of detente with the
Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.
   But the memory of Watergate, which drove Nixon to resign under
threat of impeachment in 1974, hung heavy over the festivities by
the green-and-white cottage where he was born in 1913.
   ``Only history can be the judge'' of Nixon's performance, his
daughter said, adding that she hoped the library ``will help tear
down some of the stereotypes'' regarding her father's administration.
   ``History will treat him far more kindly than his own time,''
added Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif.
   Nixon's other daughter, Tricia Nixon Cox, was to have spoken, but
stayed home with the flu, said Kevin Cartwright, spokesman for the
Richard M. Nixon Presidential Archives Foundation. Nixon, who lives
in Saddle River, N.J., stayed away to yield center stage to his
daughters, Cartwright said.
   The Richard M. Nixon Presidential Library will not include his
presidential papers, which remain at National Archives.

   Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright
Edward Albee told a group of prep school students that his troubled
days in a variety of elite East Coast private schools showed him the
limits of a formal education.
   Albee said he was thrown out of several private schools before
managing to graduate from Choate, where he said he learned that
``the real function of a formal education is to teach you how to
educate yourself when you're done with your formal education.''
   Albee, who won Pulitzers for drama in 1967 for ``A Delicate
Balance'' and again in 1975 for ``Seascape,'' recounted his prep
school days Friday for about 300 students at Kingswood-Oxford School.
   ``At the age of 14 for all my sins I found myself in Valley Forge
Military Academy,'' he said. ``I have to be very careful what I say
about this joint. It is my memory ... that they only offered two
courses _ sadism and masochism, and these were not electives.''

   NBC news correspondent Garrick Utley is rather
distressed about the content of some television talk shows, saying
they come close to inciting the public.
   ``It is getting close to crying fire in a crowded elevator,''
Utley said in a speech to the Radio-Television News Directors
Association on Thursday.
   Utley lambasted shows hosted by Morton Downey Jr. and Geraldo
Rivera. Rivera recently had his nose broken when a fight broke out
during filming of a show on white supremacists.
   ``The very presence of these shows on our TV screen gives the
programs, subjects and their behavior a certain legitimacy that this
is proper behavior. It is not,'' Utley said.

<HEAD>Some 200 U.S., Soviet Satellites Spying on Earth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new military spy satellite carried into
space is viewed by some experts as capable of gathering such
important information that it is only a matter of time before the
Soviets begin to think of ways of destroying it in the event of war.
   Like the roughly 200 military satellites already deployed in
space by the United States and Soviet Union, the $500 million
Lacrosse satellite reportedly aboard the space shuttle Atlantis is
not armed. It is a surveillance satellite, carrying a sophisticated
radar that can look down from space, piercing even cloud cover to
reveal what's happening on the ground.
   ``As military satellites become more directly applicable to
actual combat, they become much more attractive targets for
destruction,'' said John Pike, an expert on space systems with the
Federation of American Scientists here.
   ``Lacrosse provides a good example of that,'' he said. ``It's
going up there to find targets for the new stealth bomber and to
look for long-range targets deep behind the lines in the Warsaw
Pact. Now, if I've got all that riding on my satellites, the Soviets
would be crazy not to try to shoot them down.''
   ``Space is already militarized,'' agreed William Arkin, an
authority on nuclear weaponry with the Institute for Policy Studies,
a liberal think tank in Washington. ``The question is whether we're
going to avoid the weaponization of space.''
   The United States now has approximately 75 to 80 military
satellites in space, while roughly 125 of the 150-plus Russian
satellites now in orbit are thought to have some military use. The
numbers are approximate, because neither government talks about the
matter.
   The Pentagon, for example, considers the Atlantis launch a
classified military mission for which no information will be
provided. It will neither confirm nor deny that the cargo is a
radar-imaging satellite.
   As approximate as the tallies are, they demonstrate the growing
reliance of the two superpowers on military space systems. It was
only three decades ago _ in 1957 with Russia's Sputnik _ that
mankind developed the ability to put a manmade object into orbit.
   Now, military satellites are in orbit spying on facilities and
forces, scanning the radio waves as electronic ferrets, watching for
nuclear explosions or missile launches and mapping the Earth's
surface.
   Even the seemingly mundane tasks in space have become important
for war-fighting. Communications is an obvious example, but there
are others.
   For example, the latest generation of navigation satellites help
provide the pinpoint accuracy now claimed for nuclear missiles like
the giant MX. Among other functions, these satellites allow the
military to synchronize its watches down to billionths of a second.
   And scrutinizing the weather becomes essential in the event of a
war. Both the United States and Soviet Union are operating advanced
meteorological satellites to aid low-level bombers, detect solar
flares and find holes in cloud cover for reconnaissance work.
   The United States now has 20 military satellites of various types
waiting to go into orbit _ victims of the launch hiatus forced by
the Challenger disaster and unrelated problems with unmanned Titan
boosters.
   As that backlog is slowly erased, Arkin, Pike and others suggest
the Pentagon _ and perhaps the Kremlin _ will face other problems
with their satellite hardware besides protecting them as tempting
targets.
   ``The expense of these new types of satellites is not to be
believed,'' says Arkin.
   ``We're going to have to look at a single satellite the way we
look at an aircraft carrier. These satellites alone are costing $250
million and up.''
   Such complaints don't bother Pentagon officials, because they see
no alternative.
   As outgoing Air Force Secretary Edward C. ``Pete'' Aldridge
observed recently: ``We must put a large part of our investment ...
into the satellites which meet mission needs today and tomorrow.
Simply stated, we must be able to conduct operations in space, at
all times, in any environment _ peace or war.''

   A Soviet flight engineer who was part of
the crew that flew five hijackers to Israel said he wasn't
threatened by the armed captors and merely ``gave them a lift.''
   Yuri N. Yermilov appeared relaxed as he spoke from the door of
the jet Friday less than an hour after the hijackers surrendered to
Israeli police at Ben-Gurion Airport.
   He signed autographs for Israeli reporters and agreed to be
photographed with a Hebrew-language magazine in his hands.
   The hijackers were flown to Israel after seizing a bus with 30
children in the Soviet Union and trading it for a plane, crew and
$3.3 million ransom.
   ``They were playing cards,'' during the flight, Yermilov said.
``At some point, some of them were in the cockpit behind us, and
they were watching us. They had guns, but they were not waving them
around and threatening us.''
   A younger crew member, who did not give his name, added: ``They
were counting the money.''
   Yermilov, who wore a dark blue Aeroflot uniform, said the
hijackers appeared to be in their 30s. He said they never said why
they chose Israel as their destination.
   ``They were people who wanted to fly out of the Soviet Union.
That's why they kidnapped the bus with children,'' Yermilov said.
   ``They asked for a lift for Israel, and we gave them a lift,'' he
added jokingly.
   He said the crew was appointed for the mission by Soviet
authorities.
   ``We are international pilots. We understood that we have a
mission that has to be done,'' Yermilov said, adding that the crew
was aware of the danger.
   ``We were told that our guarantees are zero. But they (the
hijackers) seemed quite good-natured,'' he said.

   Portraits, costumes, documents, furniture and jewelry have been
borrowed from France, the United States, Austria, Sweden and from
British collections to tell the story of the revolution, which began
in 1789.
   Visitors will walk through a series of scenes showing the lives
of ordinary people as well as the court and politics, coming finally
to the foot of the guillotine.
   ``The visitor becomes part of the mob and hears the roll of drums
and the roar of the crowd as the blade crashes down _ and we will
have a quick escape route there for anyone who feels nervous,'' said
organizer Jane Cox.
   The show begins May 4.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Ruling Against Jaywalker; Damages to Britons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FUENGIROLA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court upheld a jaywalker's
conviction and $163,237 in damages awarded a British couple
seriously injured in an accident linked to the jaywalking, an
attorney said.
   The attorney for the couple, Alfredo Herrera, told The Associated
Press the appeals court Friday also upheld the $176 fine imposed on
Robert Williamson, 47, of Glasgow, Scotland.
   Williamson's insurance company was ordered to pay damages to
Thomas Usher, 54, and his wife Claire, 53, of London, for injuries
they suffered Sept. 26, 1986, in Mijas, in southern Spain.
   Herrera said the decision affirmed a court ruling in May that
Williamson's jaywalking on a coastal highway caused a heavy truck to
swerve to avoid him and to hit two cars.
   The accident killed a paramilitary Civil Guard officer and
seriously injured a second officer riding with him. The Ushers were
in the second car, and both were seriously injured.
   The court also upheld civil damages of $247,700 to the widow and
family of the Civil Guard officer who died and $74,300 to the
injured Civil Guard, Herrera said.

<TEXT>
   A judge who suggested a child molester was driven
to his crimes by his wife's pregnancy has resigned, the lord
chancellor said, but he offered to quit before he made his
controversial comments.
   The announcement Friday said that Judge Sir Harold Cassel
submitted his resignation Monday and cited health reasons. On
Tuesday, Cassel set off a furor by giving two years probation to a
30-year-old man who admitted three indecent assaults on his
adolescent stepdaughter.
   ``It is regrettable that a judge should have expressed himself in
a way that suggested that there are any circumstances that can
excuse or condone indecent assault on children,'' said Lord Mackay,
who as lord chancellor is chief of Britain's judicial system.
   Cassel, 72, became a judge 12 years ago.
   The defendant admitted twice molesting the girl when she was 12
and a third time when the girl was 13 and the mother was in the last
month of pregnancy.
   The mother's condition, Cassel said, led to a ``lack of sexual
appetite in the lady and considerable problems for a healthy young
husband.''
   The judge traced the abuse to the mother's efforts to overcome
the girl's resentment of the new man in the house.
   ``The stepmother encouraged the girl to cuddle her husband and
even got into the habit of inviting her into the marital bed,'' the
judge said. ``This was not an invitation to a toddler, but to a girl
approaching puberty, and the cuddles began to go too far.''
   The mother has filed for divorce.
   More than 20 members of Parliament, including lawmakers from all
major parties, called for Cassel's resignation.

   President-elect George Bush and his staff are
defending the way the transition office has handled appointments in
a week that produced only one announcement.
   All week, there was speculation that Bush would make
announcements on more Cabinet members, particularly for the defense
department and other national security jobs. But the only statement
was that Marlin Fitzwater would stay on as White House spokesman.
   Bush, who met Friday with foreign leaders and former presidential
rivals, including Michael Dukakis, seemed to bristle when reporters
asked him if his appointment process was stalled.
   ``There's no holdup. We're way ahead of schedule,'' he said,
complaining about ``early, premature, needless speculation.''
   Craig Fuller, co-director of the Bush transition office, said
Bush and his aides spent part of the past week talking to experts in
defense and national security about running the mammoth agency.
   ``The whole point of this week has been designed to try to
explore how best to manage the Defense Department, what kind of
challenges await the next secretary of defense,'' he said.
   Fuller said former Sen. John Tower of Texas remains a contender
for the job, and the vice president has ``tremendous confidence'' in
his old friend.
   Though Fuller said nothing to dispel reports that Tower is the
leading candidate for defense secretary, he added, ``There may be
others, there may be other approaches.''
   Fuller also said Bush is taking an overview of his Cabinet
vacancies because he wants to make sure women and minorities claim
some of the top jobs. To date, only white males have been named to
the positions, although Lauro Cavazos, a Hispanic, has been asked to
stay on as education secretary.
   Fuller said it could be a couple of weeks before the Cabinet is
in place, but appointments will be made as they are decided upon.
   Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported today that Bush has
decided to remove from Cabinet rank the job of ambassador to the
United Nations and not to restore to Cabinet level the director of
the Central Intelligence Agency. The paper quoted transition
officials as saying the decision reflects his belief that the two
posts _ both of which he has previously held _ should be less
visible in internal policy-making debates.
   Bush and Dukakis met for 35 minutes Friday, and the two avoided
the negative rhetoric that characterized the presidential campaign.
   ``I expressed my concern obviously about the deficit,'' Dukakis,
the former Democratic candidate, said. He also stressed issues that
were important to Democrats _ better health care, housing, education
and the environment.
   Bush said afterward: ``I want to express my appreciation to
Governor Dukakis for coming our way. We had good discussion of the
issues that are facing the country in a spirit of good will.''
   The vice president also saw Pat Robertson, who tried
unsuccessfully to gain the GOP presidential nomination. Robertson
said he talked with Bush about South Africa, a country the
television evangelist recently visited.
   ``The time has come to recognize the South African government
needs a little encouragement,'' said Robertson, an opponent of
sanctions and disinvestment as a strategy for forcing change in the
white-ruled country.
   Late in the day Bush met at his residence with Argentine
President Raul Alfonsin, who had flown in from New York for the
get-acquainted session.
   Neither Alfonsin nor Bush commented on reports from Argentina
that troops had moved into position to quell an insurrection at a
military base outside Buenos Aires.
   The government said later it had put down the rebellion.
   Vice President-elect Dan Quayle, Secretary of State George
Shultz, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Assistant Secretary of
State Elliott Abrams attended the meeting.
   Bush began his day seeing Bermuda Premier John Swan, the fourth
foreign leader he has met since he was elected. Alfonsin was the
fifth, and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev will be the sixth.
   Bush will join President Reagan at a meeting with Gorbachev in
New York on Dec. 7.
   So far, Bush's only scheduled event over the weekend is to attend
a movie entitled ``My Stepmother is an Alien'' on Saturday night.
The Bushes usually attend church on Sunday.

<TEXT>
   Thirteen people filming a documentary
were trapped more than 250 feet under the ground in a cave today
after a sudden rainstorm caused the cave's mouth to collapse, police
said.
   Police spokesman Rick Goodfield said the group was in no
immediate danger and that rescue workers were trying to reach them.
   ``The rescue team has established a communications line inside
the cave and they are all doing fine,'' said Goodfield. The
nationalities of the film makers were not known.
   The group became trapped late Friday while filming in the
extensive cave system under the isolated Nullarbor Plain in
southwestern Australia, Goodfield said.
   The Nullarbor is a huge dry plain but there is an extensive cave
system underneath it, containing subterranean water systems linking
caves.
   Peter Rogers, who left the Nullarbor group Sunday, said they were
filming a documentary on the caves. He said all of those trapped
were experienced cave divers but that the cave they were in was not
underwater.
   Rogers said the group radioed for help from their ground crew
which in turn notified authorities.
   ``It was a freak hurricane,'' he said. ``You don't get a lot of
hurricanes on the Nullarbor. So much water washed down the entrance
of the cave that it washed enough rubble down to cause a blockage
about 100 feet down into the cave.''
   Rogers said the group was safely beyond that depth in a large
chamber about 260 feet below the surface.
   ``No one's injured, they've got communication with the surface
and they've got a reasonable amount of water and food,'' Rogers said.

<TEXT>
   Veteran journalist James Henry Ferguson,
whose coverage of a 1948 Oregon flood for The Associated Press made
national headlines, died at the age of 72.
   Ferguson died Wednesday of complications following brain surgery.
   He began his career in Pennsylvania in 1935 as a reporter for the
Daily-Courier Appeal in Dubois.
   In 1937, he became editor of the Jeffersonian-Democrat in
Brookville, Pa., a weekly newspaper. The following year, the
newspaper won five first-place awards for news, editorials and
feature reporting from the Pennsylvania Publishers Association.
   Ferguson joined the Portland bureau of The Associated Press in
1945. Three years later, he covered the Vanport Flood, in which many
residents of Portland's Vanport neighborhood fled their homes when
the Columbia and Willamette Rivers left their banks.
   In 1951, Ferguson went to The Oregonian as a copy editor. He was
named business editor in the mid-1950s.
   Ferguson also worked as a regional correspondent for McGraw-Hill
Publications. In 1957, he became news director for Pacific Power &
Light Co.
   He was named an assistant vice president in 1962 and retired in
1981.
   Following his retirement, he served as chairman of the state
legislative committee of the American Association of Retired Persons
and helped win passage of a bill improving the visitation rights of
grandparents.
   A native of New Bethlehem, Pa., he attended Pennsylvania State
University and Franklin & Marshall College.

<HEAD>Sabotage Intended For Other Train Blamed In Crash Involving Jersey
Mayor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CUZCO, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A metal rod probably intended to sabotage a
passenger train instead knocked another train carrying Jersey City's
mayor off the tracks and sent it tumbling down a ravine, officials
said.
   The mayor's wife and the wife of Cuzco's mayor were killed in the
crash, which occurred Thursday during an outing to the Inca ruins of
Machu Picchu, high in the Andes.
   Jacinto Laguna, an employee of the state-owned railroad Enafer,
told The Associated Press on Friday that railroad officials found a
piece of metal wedged into the track.
   Laguna said the rod caused the railway car, a small bus modified
to travel on tracks, to jump the track at a curve and plunge into
the 200-foot deep ravine.
   Killed were Anna Cucci, about 60, the wife of Jersey City Mayor
Anthony Cucci, and Doris Chacon, 58, wife of Cuzco Mayor Carlos
Chacon.
   The politicians were injured. Cucci, 66, was reported in stable
condition at a hospital. Chacon was reported in serious condition.
   Police officials said they believe the sabotage was intended for
a regular passenger train carrying 300 passengers that was behind
the tourist car. The vehicle carrying the politicians and their
wives was making an unscheduled run.
   Police said they had detained one person. They were investigating
a group of railroad workers who were involved in a nationwide
general strike Thursday. Family members said Chacon suffered
internal bleeding and at least 18 fractures to his pelvis and spinal
column.
   The bodies of Mrs. Cucci and Mrs. Chacon were lying in state in a
Cuzco municipal building. Doctors said the women appeared to have
died from skull fractures.
   The Cuccis were visiting to celebrate a sister city agreement
between Jersey City and Cuzco. Cuzco is a tourist area about 355
miles southeast of Lima.
   Six other people were on the vehicle but did not suffer serious
injuries.

<HEAD>Ohio Announces Fernald Cleanup Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN NOLAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A historic agreement giving Ohio the authority
to regulate the federal cleanup of a uranium plant was panned by
some neighbors, who plan to pursue their lawsuit against the nuclear
weapons factory.
   Some Fernald residents complained that the agreement between the
U.S. Energy Department and Ohio approved by a federal judge Friday
fails to commit the agency to spending the $1 billion it estimates
is needed for the cleanup.
   ``I don't really see a commitment that cleanup will be done and I
don't see a timetable as to when it will be done,'' said Lisa
Crawford, spokeswoman for Fernald Residents for Environmental Safety
and Health.
   Residents also pointed out that the pact provides no money for
victims of alleged radioactive contamination from the plant, and
that the state has agreed to give up any right to sue the Energy
Department or factory contractors.
   But officials said the consent decree approved here by U.S.
District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel is a historic document allowing
Ohio to enforce state environmental regulatory power over the
cleanup of the plant, which processes uranium for nuclear weapons
assembled elsewhere.
   The agreement also requires the department to pay the state about
$1 million in penalties and to reimburse Ohio for overseeing the
cleanup.
   The Energy Department has admitted that the plant emitted
radioactive uranium dust into the atmosphere over three decades. The
plant, known as the Feed Materials Production Center, sits on 1,050
acres 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati above the Great Miami River
aquifer, a water source for 2 million people.
   Jim Alexander, spokesman for the Energy Department's Oak Ridge,
Tenn., operations, which include Fernald, said the agreement is
evidence of intent to clean up the plant. He said it is not intended
as an admission of wrongdoing.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, who announced the agreement with Ohio
Attorney General Anthony Celebrezze Jr., said he hoped the decree
will prompt Congress to give high priority to cleanups of 17 Energy
Department plants nationwide, including Fernald.
   Glenn said the Energy Department estimates it will cost $175
billion to clean up the 17 sites over the next 35 years. Only $300
million is budgeted for the job next year, he said.
   Celebrezze and Ohio Environmental Protection Agency Director
Richard Shank said Ohio will pursue two federal lawsuits against the
Energy Department. The agreement grew out of two years of
negotiations in those cases.
   Stanley Chesley, a Cincinnati lawyer for the plant's neighbors,
said the settlement gives the state no authority over radioactive
wastes stored at the plant.
   Chesley said the neighbors will proceed with their $300 million
class-action suit at a U.S. District Court hearing Dec. 16 in
Cincinnati.
   ``We have every intention of going forward,'' he said.
   Plant neighbor Marvin Clawson, who's represented in the
class-action lawsuit, said the agreement falls short of what the
Energy Department should do.
   ``It mainly addressed the hazardous-waste problem, not the
radioactive waste problem,'' said Clawson, who lives four miles from
the plant. ``They've hardly admitted to anything yet.''
   Celebrezze and Glenn said the decree is historic because it gives
a state a court-enforceable order with which to pressure the Energy
Department to clean up a nuclear facility
   ``The decree also extends Ohio's jurisdiction over Fernald to all
state and federal hazardous-waste law and regulations,'' Celebrezze
said.
   Both men said it is the first such agreement they know of in the
nation.
   The 37-year-old plant has supplied uranium to the Energy
Department's Rocky Flats plant in Colorado, the Hanford reactors in
Washington state, the Savannah River plant in South Carolina and the
Oak Ridge nuclear complex. The Savannah River reactors are shut down
because of problems there, and the closure of the Rocky Flats plant
is reportedly being considered.
   The Fernald plant has been halted by a strike that began Oct. 7.
Energy Department officials have said they expect production to
resume when the strike ends, but declined to comment on the plant's
long-term status. A department report is due out Dec. 15 on the
status of aging nuclear weapons plants nationwide.

   Public nudity has been banned in Goa,
whose white sandy beaches have long attracted tourists searching for
the allover suntan, Press Trust of India said today.
   Plainclothes policemen have been posted on the beaches of the
former Portuguese enclave, and patrol boats will keep watch to
enforce the ban, PTI said.
   ``Nudism is not allowed and violators are liable to punishment,''
say billboards set up at all major beaches in the west coast resort.
PTI did not say what the punishment would be.
   Tens of thousands of foreign and Indian tourists visit Goa every
year.
   The ban was imposed because Indians, who usually travel in
families, said they were embarrassed by the public display of
nudity, PTI said.
   Goans who operate tourist resorts also complained that nude
sunbathing was a bad influence on their children, the news agency
said.

   Four people freed from a stalled elevator
after spending the night said they kept their spirits up by playing
cards and imagining worse predicaments.
   The four were freed Friday morning after more than 14 hours in
the 4-foot-square elevator in this Mississippi River city.
   ``We were trying to decide what would be worse than this,'' Karen
Nordgren, 34, said. ``So I asked everyone, Would you rather go into
major surgery or go through this again? We all decided surgery.''
   Nordgren, Sandra Lehmann, 39; Adeline ``Kitty'' Reinhart, 59; and
her husband, Raymond, 59, said they shared vitamin C tablets and a
common toilet made from a plastic shopping bag neatly tied and
tucked in a corner.
   Nordgren and Lehmann are beauticians at a third-floor beauty shop
in the building.
   ``Normally, we never take the elevator when we leave,'' Nordgren
said. But she and Lehmann decided to enter the elevator because the
Reinharts were already in it and were holding the door for them, she
said.
   The elevator became stuck shortly before 6 p.m. Thursday.
   ``I didn't think that I was going to get out of there alive,''
Lehmann said.
   She said she eventually overcame her panic and tore a metal plate
from a telephone box inside the elevator. She then used it to pry
open the elevator door, so fresh air could enter the elevator.
   The four were not discovered until shortly after 7 a.m., when the
owner of a business in the building arrived.

Anti-begging Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A quadriplegic woman who says she
makes $2,000 a week playing an electric organ with her mouth is
challenging the city's anti-begging ordinance so she can continue
her Boardwalk performances in front of casinos.
   Celestine Tate's Municipal Court hearing was postponed Friday,
but her lawyers said they were confident they can reach an
out-of-court agreement with the city.
   The 33-year-old woman solicits money from tourists by playing a
portable electric keyboard with her tongue and lips. Birth defects
left her arms and legs undeveloped, and family members move her on a
gurney.
   Ms. Tate said she averages $2,000 a week, enough to send her two
daughters to private school.
   In the past several years, she has accumulated dozens of
summonses from police enforcing this gambling resort's anti-begging
ordinance.
   On Friday, she was in court to face 23 more.
   Ms. Tate's attorneys presented a motion challenging the
ordinance's constitutionality on grounds that it violates her right
of self-expression.
   ``There is a constitutional right to express oneself artistically
and musically,'' argued attorney Justin Loughry.
   City Prosecutor Steven Smoger said he had inadequate time to
review the last-minute motion, and said it should be dismissed.
   Judge Bruce F. Weekes agreed to delay the hearing to give Smoger
time to go over the motion and to give Ms. Tate's attorneys time to
continue negotiating with the city.
   ``I feel like my head is still on the chopping block, because
what they decide will determine my future and my life,'' Ms. Tate
said afterward. ``I believe that the Lord knows somebody's rights
were violated, so he sent me here to prove it.''
   Ms. Tate said that even though the matter is unresolved, she will
return to the Boardwalk today to perform.
   Smoger had been prepared to argue that Ms. Tate violated an
agreement made with the city two years ago.
   After a Superior Court trial in 1986, a subsequent lawsuit and a
lot of publicity, the city agreed to allow Ms. Tate to perform on
the Boardwalk. The conditions were that she must stay near Arkansas
Avenue and obtain a permit.
   Smoger said Friday that Ms. Tate had done neither.
   ``Apparently she became disgruntled because Caesar's
(hotel-casino) was hiring outdoor bands and it cut into her
gratuities, so she moved in front of fire doors at Bally's (Park
Place Casino Hotel),'' Smoger said.
   Ms. Tate acknowledged that she failed to buy insurance for a
permit. Her attorney, Joan Freedman Meyer, said the city offered her
standard one-day Boardwalk permits normally used for parades, which
require a $1 million insurance bond.
   ``That's an unreasonable demand on someone who just plays the
keyboard with her tongue,'' Ms. Meyer said. ``The rolling chairs on
the Boardwalk are only required to carry a $300,000 policy, and
they're carrying passengers.''
   Smoger agreed with Ms. Tate's lawyers that the 1986 agreement was
vaguely worded. ``But even if this is resolved, we still have to
settle the charges,'' he said.

   Brisk weather chilled the South today as a high-pressure system
expanded from Texas into America's southeast quarter, generating
light winds and making the mercury plummet.
   Temperatures early this morning were in the 20s and 30s from
Mississippi to northern Florida.
   Freeze warnings were in effect through southern Alabama, northern
Florida and the Carolinas' coast.
   The only notable precipitation across the nation was in northern
Vermont, where widely scattered snow fell.
   Skies were mostly clear across much of the nation, but cloudy
skies covered central California and clouds and dense fog were
reported in much of the Pacific Northwest.
   Today's forecast called for showers over much of Michigan, with
rain turning to snow over the Upper Michigan; widely scattered snow
in northwest Montana; and gusty winds through the central Plains and
upper Mississippi Valley.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 30s in the northern
Rockies, from northeast Montana to North Dakota, the upper
Mississippi Valley and northern sections of the upper Great Lakes
and in northern Maine; the 60s from the central California coast to
central Arizona, southern New Mexico, western Texas, Oklahoma, much
of the lower Mississippi Valley, the Tennessee Valley, southern
sections of the lower Ohio Valley and from the central Gulf Coast to
northern Florida and the middle and southern Atlantic coast; the 70s
in Southern California and parts of the desert Southwest, central
and eastern Texas and southern Florida; and in the 40s and 50s in
the rest of the country.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 11
degrees at Craig, Colo., to 64 degrees at Key West, Fla.

   Here is a message from President-elect George
Bush on the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, which begins tonight, as
released by the office of the vice president:
   On Saturday night, Jewish Americans will light the first of eight
candles as the eight-day Jewish holiday, Hanukkah, the Festival of
Lights, begins.
   Barbara and I extend to everyone celebrating Hannukah our best
wishes for a happy holiday as we recall the words of the prophet
Zechariah, ``Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit saith the
Lord of hosts.''
   The triumph of religious liberty shines like a beacon for the
world to see. Our forefathers, guided by that same light, struggled
to come to this land in a similar pursuit of the freedom to worship.
Upon our faith in the Lord rests the great strength of the United
States of America.

<HEAD>Soviet Official Says Internal Exile To Be Eliminated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union will eliminate the infamous
practice of forced internal exile in a planned reform of the
criminal code, according to a news report.
   The newspaper Sovietskaya Rossia on Friday quoted Lt. Gen. Ivan
Katargin of the Interior Ministry as saying, ``Exile is being ruled
out as inexpedient.''
   Internal exile as a form of punishment dates to the czars and has
been used against criminals, revolutionaries, political prisoners,
their relatives and, during the worst of Josef Stalin's purges,
people deemed ``socially dangerous.''
   Whole populations have been deported from their homes to Siberia
and the far north, including returning prisoners of war, farmers
during the period of collectivization in the 1930s and residents of
the Baltic republics and ethnic Germans during World War II.
   Katargin was quoted as saying exile will be eliminated as part of
a revision of the entire criminal justice system. The changes will
reduce prison sentences and substitute fines, suspended sentences
and other lesser punishments for many offenses.
   Since 1980, the proportion of convicted criminals sentenced to
imprisonment has dropped from 56 percent to 32 to 34 percent,
Katargin was quoted as saying. After the new criminal code is
passed, it is expected to drop to 22 percent to 24 percent,
according to the report.
   It was not clear from Katargin's statements to the newspaper
whether the reform would end deportation from the country as well as
internal exile.
   Nobel Prize-winning author Alexander Solzhenitsyn was stripped of
his citizenship and deported in 1974, while human rights activist
and nuclear scientist Andrei Sakharov was sentenced to internal
exile.
   Sakharov was exiled from his home in Moscow to the city of Gorky
in January 1980 for criticizing the Soviet intervention in
Afghanistan. He was released in December 1986 after receiving a
telephone call from Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Exile has often been used as a secondary punishment following a
term of imprisonment.
   Dissident Yuri Orlov, who was sent to the United States in 1986
as part of the deal that resulted in the Soviets' release of news
correspondent Nicholas Daniloff and the United States' release of
suspected spy Gennady Zakharov, spent two years in the Arctic town
of Kobyai after completing a term in a labor camp.
   Some internal exiles have been sent to a specific area, while
others are simply banished from living in their hometowns or any of
the six largest cities in the Soviet Union.
   In the past, some were exiled to a specific isolated settlement
to find on arrival that the only place to live is a labor camp and
the only food is delivered to the camp mess hall.
   More typically, exiles could settle and find work. But for
intellectuals, scientists and artists, banishment effectively ended
their careers.

   Newsroom employees at the Chicago Sun-Times have a
tentative contract for the second time in 10 days, and union and
management officials for the city's second-largest newspaper believe
the new pact will win approval.
   ``Short of a strike, this is the best package we can bring to the
membership,'' Tom Gibbons, chief negotiator for The Newspaper Guild,
said after the agreement was announced Friday.
   ``I feel confident they'll accept it'' in a ratification vote
Monday, Gibbons said.
   The newspaper's chief negotiatior, Brian Fantl, also praised the
agreement.
   ``Both sides have worked hard and hopefully the (union's) members
will accept it,'' he said. ``We were able to clear up some
misunderstandings and reach an agreement.''
   Sun-Times workers refused to consider a tentative settlement
reached Nov. 22 after a dispute developed over pension conditions.
Talks resumed Thursday, with a strike deadline set for noon Friday.
   Shortly after the deadline, the new agreement was announced.
   Reporters and others in the newsroom, many of whom had their
coats in hand waiting to start a picket line, returned to their
desks as word of the settlement spread, said Dan Lehmann, a union
spokesman and religion reporter.
   About 250 reporters, editorial and other newsroom workers belong
to the guild and have been working without a contract since June 1.
   Friday's settlement calls for a $500 cash bonus Jan. 1 rather
than July 1, and 3 percent wage increases in the second and third
years of the contract. The night city editor's position will be
exempt from the union.
   Pension benefits were increased by about 6 percent, Gibbons said.
   The pay scale at the newspaper currently ranges from $625 a week
for starting reporters to $895 for reporters with five years'
experience.
   The Sun-Times has an estimated circulation of 605,000 daily and
614,000 on Sundays. The Chicago Tribune's circulation is estimated
at 765,000 daily and 1.11 million on Sundays.

   Dan Bloom is asking children nationwide to
keep their gift lists and instead write Santa and his wife about
their feelings this holiday season.
   Bloom, a 39-year-old author of children's books and part-time
teacher in Alaska's capital, promises that Santa and Merry Claus
will write back free of charge.
   ``I want the kids to describe their families, their preparations
for Christmas, what they think the spirit of Christmas is, their
hopes for world peace and, most importantly, to name somebody who's
doing a good deed,'' Bloom said recently.
   Bloom's ``Heartlight Letterline'' is not his first holiday
letter-writing program.
   Seven years ago, while living in the western Alaska town of Nome,
Bloom invented the characters ``Bubbie and Zadie'' as a Jewish
alternative to Mr. and Mrs. Claus. He invited children to write
Bubbie and Zadie and share their feelings and joy about the holiday
season.
   ``When I was a kid growing up in Massachusetts, I felt left out
of the (Christmas) season,'' recalled Bloom, who is of Jewish
descent. ``That was my main impetus to begin Bubbie and Zadie. I
thought maybe there could be something for Jewish kids to
participate in.''
   After news articles about Bubbie and Zadie appeared across the
nation, Bloom received thousands of letters from children of all
faiths.
   ``In Yiddish, Bubbie and Zadie means Grandma and Grandpa, and
basically they are everybody's Grandma and Grandpa,'' Bloom said.
``They represent the love that grandparents have for grandchildren,
and I think that's why it worked. I think if I had created Father
Hanukkah or something, it wouldn't have been as endearing.''
   Bloom said he was motivated to keep the program going by the
wonder and spirit of childhood reflected in the letters.
   ``I remember one of the first letters I got said, `Dear Bubbie
and Zadie: Do you happen to know my Bubbie and Zadie, Herman and
Sarah from Cincinnati?' _ as if these grandparents in Nome know all
grandparents. The children's world is an amazing world,'' he said.
   Bloom wrote a 1983 book about Bubbie and Zadie. Sales of the
book, which includes an address, have kept dozens of letters coming
to the mythical couple each year.
   Last fall, he decided to apply the same letter-writing idea to
Santa Claus to open it up to more children and to counter the
materialism that has become part of the season.
   ``There's a lot of these little mail-order things where for $5
you can have a Christmas letter sent from Santa Claus to your kid,
but it's just a commercial thing and there's not much feeling to
it,'' Bloom said.
   ``As I see Santa and Merry, they are everybody's grandparents. It
fits in, I think, with the Santa Claus myth.''
   Santa's wife figures prominently because ``spiritual things
should be male and female whenever possible,'' Bloom said.
   ``A little girl, for instance, might have something personal to
tell Merry,'' he said.
   Bloom said his Jewish background should not disqualify him from
perpetuating a symbol of a Christian holiday.
   ``Jewish-smewish. We're all related in this world and I, myself,
believe in a philosophy of universalism. I'm deeply Jewish in my
background and I'm proud of it. But I'm a universalist in that I
don't really believe in any one religion per se.''
   Bloom said he will answer all the letters and plans to recruit
friends to help if necessary.
   ``I get enormous satisfaction in doing this.''

<HEAD>U.S. Takes Five Cubans Home In First Deportation Since Prison
Uprisings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOYT HARWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>

   A lawyer who helped end prison riots by
Cuban detainees criticized the deportation of five men who fled Cuba
in the 1980 Mariel boatlift as an unjustified normalization of
relations with Fidel Castro's government.
   A federal Marshal's Service airplane ferried five handcuffed
Cuban prisoners, all convicted of crimes in the United States, from
Birmingham to an airfield near Havana, Cuba, on Friday.
   They were the first Cubans deported since a repatriation
agreement with the Caribbean island nation ignited riots at federal
prisons in Atlanta and Oakdale, La., last year.
   ``We hope to have many of these flights,'' said Justice
Department spokeswoman Deborah Vurstion-Wade.
   ``It's a tragic day for the aspirations of the Cuban people to a
free Cuba without Castro,'' said Rafael Penalver, a Miami attorney
who negotiated a settlement with Cuban detainees that ended the
riots. ``This is normalization in criminal wrappings.''
   When the men, accompanied by two U.S. guards, got off the plane
in Havana, three of them ``knelt down and kissed the ground,'' Ms.
Vurstion-Wade said.
   She said about 20 Cuban officials met them, exchanged documents
with U.S. officials, and took the five away on a bus. She said she
did not know where the bus took them.
   The agreement with Castro calls for up to 100 Cubans a month to
be returned.
   About 500 are still in custody of the 2,746 Cuba agreed in 1984
to take back, Carla Dudeck, coordinator for the Coalition to Support
Cuban Detainees, said in Atlanta. The others have been paroled, and
some have appeals pending.
   A federal judge in Birmingham is to rule next week on a temporary
injunction against the deportation of 10 other Cubans from a federal
prison at Talladega, 60 miles east of Birmingham.
   The judge last week refused to halt deportation of three of the
five who left Friday; the other two did not fight repatriation.
   The three unsuccessfully took their cases to an appellate court
in Atlanta and the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled 8-1 against them
Friday.
   ``This is a giant leap toward normalization with Castro,''
Penalver said. ``It's the normalization of our deportation laws and
the application of normal deportation laws to the community.
   ``For 30 years it has been U.S. policy to defer deportation of
Cuban nationals until Cuban rights were restored in Cuba. Nothing
has changed in Cuba to justify a change of U.S. policy at this time.
   ``Furthermore, I think it's inconsistent and self-defeating for
the U.S. to send human beings who have completed serving their
sentences for whatever wrong they committed here to the very same
jails that the U.S. condemns for the atrocities that take place
there,'' Penalver said.
   The Cubans who fought deportation claimed they would face
mistreatment in their homeland.
   In the 1980 boatlift, about 125,000 people, some of them convicts
or mentally ill, sailed illegally from Mariel, Cuba, to the United
States.
   Friday's flight was the first since a 1987 U.S.-Cuban agreement
to resume deportations. When the pact became known, Cubans rioted
for 11 days at Atlanta and Oakdale, with 125 people held hostage,
one inmate killed and massive damage to both prisons.
   The five returned to Cuba are Miguel Beitia-Socarraz, 28, who
pleaded guilty to second-degree burglary; Onel Calzado-Garlobo, 43,
convicted in 1982 of attempted sexual assault charges involving a
13-year-old girl; Rene Maurin-Oliva, who pleaded guilty to theft and
battery; and Hector Hernandez-Quesada and Angel Meneses-Hernandez,
who did not fight deportation and about whom little was known.

<HEAD>Botanical Artist Who Specialized In The Amazon Area Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Botanical artist and explorer Margaret Mee, who
braved blood-sucking gnats, malaria and drunken gold prospectors in
pursuit of rare flowers in the deepest Amazonian rain forests, died
in a car accident, her family said.
   Mrs. Mee was 79. She was killed Wednesday in an auto crash near
Seagrave in central England, her family announced Friday.
   In 1952, she and her second husband, Greville Mee, went to live
in Rio de Janeiro. She had recently returned to Britain to open an
exhibition of her paintings at the Royal Botanic Gardens in west
London.
   Mrs. Mee was also in Britain for the publication last month of
her diaries, ``In Search of the Flowers of the Amazon Forests,'' and
a lecture tour.
   Mrs. Mee was born near London and studied art as a child.
   She made the first of her 15 Amazon expeditions in 1956 to
observe, collect and paint flowers. Her last trip there was in May
when she traveled to the Igapo forest on Brazil's Rio Negro to paint
the rare, night-blooming Amazonian moonflower.
   ``As I stood there with the dim outline of the forest all around,
I was spellbound. Then the first petal began to move and then
another as the flower burst into life,'' she wrote in her diaries.
   Mrs. Mee packed a gun with her brushes and watercolors.
   On one journey, drunken gold prospectors burst into her hut in an
Indian village, she wrote. She told them it was not proper to enter
a lady's hut when the lady was alone, and they left.
   Hours later, their leader returned, but when he found himself
looking down the barrel of a .32-caliber revolver he left, she wrote,
   Other hazards included snakes, poisonous spiders, blood-sucking
buffalo gnats and several bouts of malaria and hepatitis.
   Mrs. Mee also became a leader in the campaign to conserve the
rain forests and protect the forest Indians.
   In 1986, she was made a member of the Linnean Society, the
prestigious botanical society named after the 18th-century Swedish
botanist Carl von Linne.
   The recently established Margaret Mee Amazon Trust provides
scholarships to help Brazilian botanists study in Britain. The trust
also paid for the purchase of 60 of Mrs. Mee's Amazon paintings for
the Royal Botanic Gardens.
   Her other paintings are distributed around the world in botanical
institutions and private and public collections.
   She is survived by her husband, Greville.

   A five-year plan to open the U.S. marketplace to
products from the Caribbean has been successful despite a 30 percent
decline in exports from the region during the program, a Reagan
administration official says.
   When President Reagan first proposed the Caribbean Basin
Initiative in 1982, the region was suffering from low export
earnings, declining commodity prices, stagnant productivity and
dried-up private investment, said Elliott Abrams, assistant
secretary of state for inter-American affairs.
   ``Now, only five years later, CBI countries are turning their
economies around,'' Abrams told the region's leaders Friday at the
12th annual Miami Conference on the Caribbean.
   Abrams blamed the 30 percent decline in export earnings on
falling oil prices, and said that aside from oil, ``exports from the
region have been growing.''
   Although Caribbean and Central American nations have long been
critical of lowered U.S. import quotas for such traditional regional
exports as oil and sugar, Abrams said Washington sees such cutbacks
as vital to the program's success.
   ``In the final accounting,'' he said, ``It is the growth of
non-traditional exports which is the most important and the most
promising outcome of the initiative.''
   Area nations become more competitive and less economically
vulnerable with broader export portfolios, such as fly-fishing lures
made in Guatemala, fine mahogany furniture in Honduras and
installation of free trade zones _ creating more than 80,000 new
jobs _ in the Dominican Republic, Abrams said.
   While U.S. Commerce Department figures show $1.5 billion has been
invested in Caribbean Basin countries since the program started,
continued expansion will depend on efforts towards ``long-term,
self-sustaining economic growth,'' Abrams said.
   Abrams also credited the program with fostering democracy in the
region.
   ``The Caribbean of the 1980s has been marked by smooth democratic
transitions through open elections,'' Abrams said on the final day
of the conference.
   President Reagan, in a telephoned message to the conference,
agreed.
   ``Today, freely elected democratic governments are in power in
virtually all countries in the region,'' Reagan said in the call
from Washington. ``Through regional cooperation, a totalitarian
regime was ousted in Grenada, and there are now four thriving
democracies in Central America.''
   Reagan attributed regional economic growth to the initiative and
economic reforms undertaken by nations in the region.
   ``The economic and political achievements of the region over the
past eight years do not bear the label `Made in the USA,''' Reagan
said. ``These changes were made by the Americas _ all the Americas.''
   Another vote of confidence in the program came from Dominican
Prime Minister Eugenia Charles, who also addressed the conference.
   ``Anyone who says CBI was a case of U.S. designs being pushed
down our throats either doesn't know what he's talking about _ or
wasn't there,'' Charles said.

   Hundreds of shantytown dwellers hurled rocks
at police who prevented them from storming the Union Carbide
pesticide plant today, the fourth anniversary of a gas leak that
killed more than 3,300 people.
   Police said they arrested at least 200 of the demonstrators.
Protest organizers put the arrest total at 500.
   Most of the protesters, estimated by reporters to number 1,000,
came from shantytowns lying in the path of the deadly white cloud of
methyl isocyanate that leaked out of the plant Dec. 3, 1984.
   A few demonstrators suffered minor injuries in scuffles with
police, who carried steel-tipped bamboo canes but no firearms. There
was no sign of injuries to police.
   Five activists from the Communist Party of India broke away from
police and scaled the 8-foot-high wall surrounding the derelict
factory complex, but four of them were grabbed by plainclothes
police.
   The fifth succeeded in climbing a watchtower and briefly hoisted
the party flag before police hauled him and the red banner away.
   ``We want justice! We want justice!'' the crowd shouted in Hindi.
Some called for the public hanging of Warren Anderson, who was
president of the U.S.-based multinational corporation when the gas
leak occurred.
   Last year, the Indian government filed murder charges against
Anderson and other Union Carbide officials in India and abroad in
conjunction with its $3 billion damage suit against the Danbury,
Conn.-based company.
   The damage suit, initiated in 1986, has bogged down in a maze of
legal maneuvers in courts in Madhya Pradesh state, which includes
Bhopal, and in the Supreme Court in New Delhi. Anderson and the
others have not responded to summonses on the murder charges.
   Effigies of Anderson were set ablaze outside the Bhopal plant
Friday night and again today.
   The Communist Party was the most visible organizer of today's
protests, but other opposition parties and activist groups
campaigning for the rights of gas victims participated in vigils at
the plant gates.
   Balkrishna Gupta, the Communist Party secretary for Madhya
Pradesh state, said 500 demonstrators were arrested.
   Police Superintendent Panna Lal said, ``A couple hundred have
been arrested, but we have not yet made a head count.''
   Reporters who watched the arrested being taken away in eight
government buses estimated the total at 400.
   Police sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
demonstrators would be released without charge within a few hours.
Such detentions are legal under Indian law and are commonly used to
break up protests.
   About 500 uniformed police were on hand for the demonstration.
Some had tear gas but did not use it.
   The government says the official death toll from the 1984 gas
leak has reached 3,329.
   Gas Relief Commissioner S. Saytam, a state official whose office
records the deaths and administers relief, said gas victims continue
to die at a rate of at least one a day.
   About 20,000 survivors still suffer from exposure to the gas.
Most say they have respiratory and eye problems.
   Union Carbide said the leak was caused by sabotage by a
disgruntled employee.

   Searchers traveled the river deltas and
channels of southern Bangladesh today looking for more than 3,000
people missing after a cyclone that killed at least 1,300 people.
   Officials said the death toll from Tuesday night's cyclone had
reached 900 in Bangladesh and 400 in India's neighboring West Bengal
state. Dhaka newspapers said the Bangladesh toll may be as high as
1,500.
   The core of the cyclone and the hardest winds struck the lightly
populated Sunderbans forest, an expanse of mangrove trees that
sprawls across the Bangladesh-India border. Officials who spoke on
condition of anonymity said most of the forest dwellers were safe.
   But fishermen who had established colonies along the Sunderbans
coast were hit hard. The independent Ittefaq newspaper said hundreds
of bodies were seen floating in the Sunderbans channels and in the
river deltas of Khulna and Bagerhat districts east of the forest
region.
   Ali Hasan Quereshi, secretary-general of the Bangladesh Red
Crescent Society, said the death toll had reached 900 and may exceed
1,000.
   Another official at the Red Crescent, the Moslem equivalent of
the Red Cross, said 3,000 people, mostly fishermen, were missing.
The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Bangladeshi newspapers reported death tolls ranging from 1,000 to
1,500.
   In India, West Bengal Finance Minister Asim Dasgupta said 400
deaths had been officially confirmed, United News of India reported.
   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad of Bangladesh called a special
Cabinet meeting Sunday to discuss relief and rehabilitation efforts.
   Bangladesh officials and foreign relief workers estimated that 40
percent to 70 percent of the rice crop, the staple in the national
diet, was destroyed or damaged by the storm.
   The Sunderbans forest is the home of the royal Bengal tiger, but
there were no official reports of tiger deaths. The Ittefaq
newspaper, however, said hundreds of animals were killed in the
Sunderbans.
   Tiger deaths in the forest have gone unreported in the past.
Newspapers have said game wardens like to sell the tiger pelts, and
if they reported tiger deaths they might have to give the pelts to
the government.

   An earthquake shook Southern California early
today, residents said.
   ``The house shook violently for a few seconds,'' Associated Press
Assistant Chief of Bureau Paul Simon said in Altadena 15 miles north
of Los Angeles.
   Simon said the quake hit around 3:40 a.m.
   The shock knocked out computers in The Associated Press bureau in
Los Angeles.
   In Palmdale 60 miles north of the city, AP staffer Dennis

   A mental patient being held in the slayings of
five people in two states demanded to see ``Highway to Heaven'' star
Michael Landon just before he shot two Universal City guards to
death, officials say.
   ``Prior to the shooting, the suspect went on the Universal
Studios tour,'' said Sgt. Ernie Roop of the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department. ``He asked several studio employees if he
could talk to Michael Landon, but was denied access.''
   Nathan Nick Trupp, asked studio guards Thursday if he could use
the telephone in their shack to contact Landon, Roop said. Trupp
left when a guard told him to use a pay phone, but returned and
began shooting, the sergeant said.
   Trupp, 42, was wounded moments later in a gunbattle with deputies
near the Universal City entertainment complex.
   A spokesman for Landon said the actor was aware of Trupp's
attempt to see him.
   The actor had no comment, Harry Flynn said Friday. ``It's very
unsettling for everybody,'' Flynn said.
   Thursday was the last day of filming for ``Highway to Heaven,''
which has run for five seasons on NBC-TV. Landon plays an angel on
the show.
   Trupp is being held in the slayings of the two guards and is
wanted in the slayings Tuesday of three people at a bagel shop in
Albuquerque, N.M.
   The number of fatalities attributed to Trupp rose to five Friday
with the death of Armando Torres, 18, one of the two guards shot,
said Lori Hull, a spokeswoman for Saint Joseph Medical Center in
Burbank.
   The guard killed Thursday night was Jeren Beeks, 27.
   Trupp was listed in serious but stable condition at St. Joseph,
where he underwent surgery for chest and arm wounds.
   Albuquerque police Sgt. Ruth Lowe said authorities would try to
extradite Trupp to New Mexico.
   Trupp's brother, Philip, a Washington, D.C., author, told the
Albuquerque Journal his brother had a lifelong history of mental
problems.
   Trupp was involuntarily committed to Trenton Psychiatric
Hospital, New Jersey's main state psychiatric institution, on Nov.
25, 1987. But a court ruled he posed no threat and ordered him
released to a supervised boarding house in February 1988, said Mary
Kay Risi, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of Human
Services.
   Trupp left the Trenton area boarding house April 5, a day after
arriving, she said.
   Police have said they had no motive in the bagel shop slayings of
Richard Wilt, 39, his wife, Jeanne Wilt, 37, both of Albuquerque,
and the woman's father, Joseph Famiglietta Sr., 63, of suburan Rio
Rancho.
   About 200 relatives and friends of the three people gathered at
St. Thomas Aquinas Church in Rio Rancho for a memorial Mass on
Thursday.
   ``Three innocent people have been killed for no reason
whatsoever,'' the Rev. Edward Rutowksi told mourners.

   Gunmen slipped into a hospital and killed
a convicted Mafia member while he slept, police reported today.
   Fearing an attack, the victim, Angelo Bottaro, had kept a pistol
hidden in his bedclothes, the Italian news agency ANSA quoted
investigators as saying.
   Investigators said the killers apparently entered the hospital
through a ground floor window and shot Bottaro with pistols and
rifles, ANSA reported.
   The assailants escaped.
   The news agency said Bottaro, 39, claimed during several trials
that he was insane and had recently requested neurological treatment
at the hospital.
   Bottaro had been convicted of several crimes, including murders
connected to the underworld and of belonging to the Mafia.

<TEXT>
   A proposal for direct talks between
Tibetan and Chinese leaders on the future of Tibet is running into
serious difficulties, sources close to Tibet's government-in-exile
said today.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Chinese
appear reluctant to meet in Geneva in January, as proposed by the
Tibetans, and would prefer to meet in Beijing, a venue long rejected
by the Tibetan side.
   The sources suggested a Beijing venue would portray the Tibetan
issue as an internal Chinese matter, rather than an international
one that could be perceived as Chinese recognition of Tibetan
demands for self-rule.
   China invaded Tibet in 1949 and annexed it a year later.
   Many Tibetans have long insisted on independence for their
Himalayan mountain region, but their spiritual and temporal leader,
the Dalai Lama, suggested in June that Tibet could become ``a
self-governing democratic politicial entity ... in association with
China.''
   In his biggest concession so far, the Dalai Lama also said China
could continue to handle Tibet's foreign relations and keep troops
on Tibetan soil.
   Senior Tibetan officials in India declined to confirm the reports
that the Chinese were reluctant to meet in Geneva. But Lodi Gyari,
minister for information and international relations in the
self-styled government-in-exile, said: ``We are not denying them.''
   The Chinese Embassy in New Delhi had no reply to the report. The
embassy's chief spokeswoman was out of town, and an aide said no one
else could comment.
   The reports of Chinese reluctance to meet a Tibetan delegation in
Geneva surfaced after the Dalai Lama's Cabinet convened a special
meeting in Dharmsala on Nov. 25. The meeting was attended by the
Dalai Lama's elder brother, Gyalo Thondup, who had just returned
from Beijing.
   Thondup, a Hong Kong-based businessman, has long served as a
go-between for the Tibetans and Chinese.

   Guerrillas killed 31 people and wounded
53 in an attack on a small town, and government forces responded by
killing 39 rebels, Radio Mozambique reported.
   Government and ruling Frelimo Party officials in the northern
port city of Beira were quoted by Radio Mozambique on Friday night
as saying the attack by the Mozambique National Resistance
guerrillas occurred Wednesday at Chibabava, in the central province
of Sofala.
   The officials said the guerrillas, who have been fighting since
1977 against the Marxist government, used firearms and unspecified
steel weapons against the townspeople.
   In clashes that followed the raid, government forces stationed in
the town killed 39 guerrillas and captured 10, said the officials.
   It was not possible to independently verify the report, which did
not say what motivated the guerrillas to attack the town.

<TEXT>
   The federal government has reversed its policy
of counting loans as income for welfare recipients after a Nevada
lawsuit showed the practice violated the law since its inception
five years ago, officials said.
   The lawsuit and similar cases in other states, including
California, prompted the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services to chang the policy Tuesday, according to a motion filed
Friday in U.S. District Court.
   ``We feel good. We feel real good,'' said attorney Jon Sasser of
Nevada Legal Services, which represents poor people.
   Health and Human Services spokesman Campbell Gardett said he
could not say how many people nationally would be affected by the
policy change.
   The motion filed by Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Sullivan asked
Judge Edward C. Reed to delay a final decision in the 1986
class-action lawsuit filed by Nevada Legal Services on behalf of
state residents denied benefits under the loan policy.
   The Health and Human Services Department was named as a third
party in the lawsuit but was not involved in a proposed settlement
between the state and Nevada Legal Services.
   Anticipating the judge's ruling against the federal government in
the case, attorneys for the federal agency requested a 30-day delay
in a final order so they also could work out a settlement.
   The proposed settlement, which must be approved by Reed, was
filed Wednesday.
   In the proposed settlement, Nevada agreed to repay 60 people
$11,767 for welfare payments that were denied when personal loans
were counted as income, making them ineligible for benefits.
   Deputy state Welfare Division Administrator Michael Willden said
he was pleased by the federal government's latest move.
   The Welfare Division had disagreed with the loan-as-income policy
since federal authorities forced it on the states in 1983, he said.
The Aid to Dependent Children program is funded 50 percent by the
federal government.
   ``The loans should have never been counted,'' Willden said. ``But
we had no choice. We would have lost our federal funding. I think
this lawsuit did turn the policy around.
   ``It was clearly shown that the administration's regulations were
violating the welfare laws.''
   Willden said it cost Nevada more than $40,000 to locate people
unqualified for welfare benefits by the loan policy.
   Initial estimates showed as many as 3,000 people in Nevada might
have been affected by the policy, but most could not be found.
   Last year, Reed issued a preliminary injunction preventing the
Welfare Division from counting loans as income in determining
benefit eligibility pending the outcome of the lawsuit.

   The blood disease snail fever has been contracted
by 1 million people in southern China and has made a comeback in
some areas where it had previously been wiped out, an official daily
said today.
   The People's Daily said the resurgence of the occasionally fatal
disease occurred because of lax control by local governments and a
drop in funding to eradicate the disease-bearing oncomelania, a
freshwater snail.
   The overseas edition of the daily said the disease has returned
to Shanghai and areas of the southern provinces of Guangdong and
Fujian where it had previously been eliminated.
   Snail fever, also known as schistosomiasis, is prevalent in 12
provinces, and is most serious in riverside or swampy areas of
Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces.
   The disease, transmitted into the bloodstream by a parasite,
results in fever, distended stomach, rashes, inflammation of the
liver and in severe cases death. China says it has cured more than
11 million sufferers, or 95 percent of all victims of the disease,
since 1949.

<HEAD>Judge to Decide if U.S. Was At War With Nicaragua</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge agreed to decide if
the United States was at war with Nicaragua in the mid-1980s, the
key issue in the case against six men accused of illegally providing
military aid to the Contras.
   In a pretrial hearing Friday, the defendants argued that the
Neutrality Act, under which they were indicted, applies only to
nations with which the nation is at peace, and said the United
States conducted a de facto war against Nicaragua's Sandinista
government. They are asking that the case against them be dismissed.
   U.S. District Judge Norman C. Roettger held the hearing on the
``at-peace'' issue over the objections of the U.S. attorney's
office, which sought to delay the matter until the trial.
   ``It will indeed be an historical decision, whatever the court
determines,'' said defense attorney David Savitz.
   Roettger continued the hearing until Jan. 5, and said he would
decide the issue shortly thereafter.
   The defense Friday presented volumes of Iran-Contra committee and
Tower Commission reports to back up its contention that even during
the periods when Congress halted military aid to the rebels, the
Reagan administration continued to run a war against the Sandinistas.
   Contra leader Adolfo Calero, whose brother Mario Calero is one of
the defendants, took the stand to testify that former National
Security Council aide Oliver North provided the rebels with $32
million during the congressional cutoff, much of which was spent on
arms.
   He said U.S. support actually increased during the 1984-85 period
of the aid cutoff and the defendants' alleged illegal activities.
   ``They told us that the president of the United States would
continue to solicit funds for us,'' sai Adolfo Calero. ``They said
they would continue to support us, and that we should not give up.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Debelier tried to draw distinctions
between Nicaragua and other U.S. military actions, including the
Vietnam War, saying that in those cases the executive branch
received congressional support.
   The judge seemed to dismiss that argument, however, mentioning
Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, Afghanistan and raids on Iran and
Libya.
   ``The only distinction with the Nicaraguan situation is that you
have one branch of government expressing its displeasure,'' Roettger
said.
   Debelier noted that much of the testimony regarding support for
the Contras revolved around commitments made and privately raised
funds provided by North, who is under indictment for his role in
aiding the rebels.
   ``You can't say that because two or three members of the
executive branch are going to solicit funds for the Contras, that is
the same as binding the government'' to warlike activities in
Nicaragua, the prosecutor said.
   The group was indicted in June after charges of Reagan
administration foot-dragging during the highly publicized
investigation. Opponents of aid to the Contras accused Attorney
General Edwin Meese III of stalling the case because it threatened
to uncover illegal activities by North.
   When the indictment _ along with a similar one filed against six
other men accused of running a Contra training camp in the
Everglades _ was finally made public, it accused Contra supporters
of violating the Neutrality Act by launching operations against the
Sandinista government from U.S. soil from October 1984 to March 1985.
   The seven original defentants were Thomas Posey, head of the
Alabama-based Civilian Material Assistance group; Mario Calero, a
former supply manager for the rebels; Joe Adams, Adolfo Calero's
former bodyguard; Jack Terrell, a former mercenary who turned
against the effort and went to authorities; Maco Stewart, a wealthy
former Texas businessman and state official who now lives in France;
Jose Coutin, a Miami Cuban and former CMA liaison in Florida, and
Alex Martinez, a conservative Cuban-American stockbroker.
   The indictment accuses them of recruiting and training
mercenaries to fight with Contras, supplying them with equipment,
leading them on expeditions, including one aimed at blowing up a
Nicaraguan bridge, and violating firearms laws.
   Stewart allegedly financed some of the activities.
   Some of the defendants, including Terrell and Posey, have
produced documents showing the FBI and other agencies were aware of
their activities, and have said that knowledge of their activities
went all the way to the White House.
   Adams pleaded guilty. He was fined $50 and sentenced to a day of
probation. The other six defendants continue to fight the charges.

   Joel Steinberg admitted knocking his illegally
adopted daughter, Lisa, to the floor on the night prosecutors say he
beat the 6-year-old to death, his former live-in lover testified at
his murder trial.
   ``I knocked her down and she didn't want to get up again. This
staring business (by Lisa) had gotten to be too much,'' Hedda
Nussbaum quoted Steinberg as saying.
   The conversation during a cocaine-smoking session a few hours
after the incident the night of Nov. 1, 1987, Ms. Nussbaum testified
Friday in state court.
   The next morning, Steinberg sounded ``frantic'' as he called for
her, Ms. Nussbaum said. ``And I came running back into the bedroom
and he said, `She stopped breathing.' And he was frantically trying
to revive her.''
   Minutes later, she said, Steinberg told her to call the 911
emergency number and she did. The unconscious girl was taken to a
hospital, where she died three days later of a brain hemorrhage.
   Ms. Nussbaum, 46, is the key prosecution witness against
Steinberg. Her testimony was the first the jury has heard directly
implicating him in the blows that the prosecution says killed the
girl.
   Steinberg, a 47-year-old disbarred lawyer, is charged with
second-degree murder. Ms. Nussbaum was also arrested after Lisa's
death, but charges against her were dropped and she agreed to
testify against him.
   Ms. Nussbaum said Steinberg had angrily accused Lisa of
practicing ``a stare that was supposed to hypnotize the person
stared at.''
   In her second day of testimony, Ms. Nussbaum said she once viewed
Steinberg as ``godlike'' and tried to protect him when he severely
beat and brainwashed her.
   Speaking deliberately, Ms. Nussbaum said she was cut off for
years from her family and friends. During one period, Steinberg
forbade her from leaving their apartment without his permission; she
lost her job as an editor at Random House after repeatedly missing
work because of black eyes, she said.
   ``Most of the time he made me sleep on the floor or in the
bathtub if I had displeased him,'' she testified.
   Asked about her relationship with Steinberg in late 1983 or early
1984, Ms. Nussbaum replied, ``At that time, he began beating me
severely.''
   Prosecutors also submitted as evidence commandments that
Steinberg issued to Ms. Nussbaum that came under the page heading,
``My goals in terms of Joel's interest.''
   He also would force her to write ``punishment lessons'' much like
an errant pupil, writing each item 10 times, Ms. Nussbaum said.
Among the things she was forced to write: ``Anger is destructive,
not constructive.''
   Judge Harold Rothwax instructed the jury that Steinberg was on
trial for the crime he is charged with ``and not for being a
particular kind of person.''
   The judge had agreed to a prosecution argument that the only way
it could explain Ms. Nussbaum was incapable of saving the girl on
the night Lisa was fatally injured was to show the extent to which
she had been dominated by Steinberg.
   Ms. Nussbaum testified Thursday that she didn't call for
emergency help for Lisa because she thought Steinberg had the power
to heal the unconscious girl.
   The trial is scheduled to continue Monday.

<TEXT>
   Faulty installation and assembly of a jet
engine by Spanish air force mechanics caused last month's crash of a
U.S.-built F-18A Hornet fighter-bomber, a newspaper reported today.
   Spain's leading daily El Pais said preliminary results of a
Defense Ministry probe indicated the error caused the twin-engine
jet to crash and burn Nov. 7 in a field near an air base outside the
northern city of Zaragoza.
   The pilot parachuted to safety a minute after takeoff, when an
engine caught fire and an anti-fire instrument failed to put out the
blaze, the paper said, citing unidentified Defense Ministry sources.
   The paper said the sources described the inability of the
anti-fire instrument to extinguish the flames as ``very strange''
and made them think oil, lubricants or some other material kept the
fire alive. Both engines were new and had been recently installed to
replace the original ones.
   A military guard on duty at the Defense Ministry told The
Associated Press today that no one would be available to comment on
the report until Monday.
   The accident provoked criticism of the Socialist administration
of Premier Felipe Gonzalez for buying 72 F-18A Hornets from U.S.
maker McDonnell Douglas for $1.6 billion, the country's largest
single military purchase.
   The investigation involved experts from the Defense Ministry, the
Spanish Air Force, McDonnell Douglas and U.S. jet engine maker
General Electric and was to present its formal findings in the next
few days, the paper said.

<HEAD>Reforms Make Effort to Compromise with Republics</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union today published details of its new
government structure that retains central control over the 15
republics while attempting to compromise with their demands for more
autonomy.
   Publication in all major Soviet daily newspapers gave Soviet
citizens their first look at the final version of a political
structure that will govern them beginning in March.
   After an intense five-week public debate in which a quarter
million suggestions were made for changes, the Supreme Soviet, or
parliament, and its Presidium, the country's highest executive body,
approved changes in about half the articles.
   The final project, which President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has said
is crucial to his reform effort, was approved Thursday by the
1,500-member Supreme Soviet with five ``no'' votes.
   The reforms will establish a Congress of People's Deputies,
two-thirds by popular vote and a third by the Communist Party, trade
unions and other organizations. The deputies will pick members of a
smaller two-house Supreme Soviet that will meet twice a year for
four months at a time. The current body meets several days a year.
   The president becomes the head of the the Defense Council and has
the right to conduct international negotiations and sign treaties.
   Among the articles apparently watered down in the final draft was
one that republics opposed because they said it called into question
their right to secede from the Soviet Union.
   The final draft gave the Congress of People's Deputies the power
to ``make decisions on matters of national-state structure which are
in the jurisdiction of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.''
   Previous language had given it the power to make decisions ``on
the composition of the U.S.S.R.''
   The new law establishes similar Congresses of People's Deputies
in the 15 republics as well, but leaves it to the republics'
constitutions to outline their powers. The original draft included a
lengthy list of powers of the republics' congresses.
   That also appeared to be an effort to compromise with officials
from the republics, especially Estonia. Estonian President Arnold
Ruutel, in a speech to the Supreme Soviet, said the republic did not
want to be forced to form a Congress of People's Deputies.
   ``It is impossible to find an optimum (political system) for all
regions of the country,'' Ruutel said. ``So we have created our
own.''
   Estonia has led opposition to the constitutional changes. On Nov.
16 its Supreme Soviet made a ``declaration of sovereignty'' in
internal affairs, and proclaimed its right to approve all new
national laws.
   The national government declared the move unconstitutional.
   The final version of the law gives the republics more
representatives in the Soviet of Nationalities, one of the two
houses of the Supreme Soviet, and also ensures they be represented
on a new constitutional oversight commission.
   It orders directives of the central government to be published in
the languages of the republics. But it also gives the national
Presidium specific powers to ensure that the constitutions and laws
of the republics correspond to the national constitution.
   There were complaints that giving organizations such as the
Communist Party and unions the right to elect one-third of the
members of the national Congress would violate the principle of one
man, one vote, by allowing union or party members to vote more than
once, or even hold several seats.
   The final draft says that in selecting the Supreme Soviet, the
Congress of People's Deputies must make sure that members of the
party or other organizations not be over-represented.
   Gorbachev, in a speech Nov. 29, told the Supreme Soviet it would

   Two mortar bombs were fired at a
British army base today but missed their target, police said.
   The two bombs were thought to have been launched from a field
near the Ulster Defense Regiment base, outside Clogher, 50 miles
southwest of Belfast, said a Royal Ulster Constabulary spokesman who
demanded anonymity.
   The constabulary is the British province's police force.
   In a neighboring county, shots were fired during the night at
soldiers on patrol near the town of Balleek on the western border
with the Republic of Ireland, police said. The patrol did not return
fire.
   In Kesh, 80 miles west of Belfast, a bomb exploded in an unmanned
border customs post during the night, causing no injuries but
extensive damage to the small building.
   There were no claims of responsibility for the attacks, but
suspicion fell on the outlawed mainly Roman Catholic Irish
Republican Army.
   The IRA is fighting to oust the British from the mainly
Protestant province and unite it with the predominantly Roman
Catholic republic.

   A second sailor has died of injuries
sustained in an explosion and fire on the aircraft carrier USS
Nimitz, officials said today.
   Chadwick R. Henderson, 19, of Rockford, Ill., was in intensive
care at a U.S. military hospital when he died Friday night from
extensive burns he suffered in the accident Wednesday, said Marie
Shaw, spokeswoman at the Landstuhl Army Regional Medical Center.
   The Landstuhl facility, 70 miles southwest of Frankfurt, is
equipped with a special burn unit. Family members had flown to West
Germany and were at the hospital when Henderson died, Mrs. Shaw said.
   The Nimitz was operating in the northern Arabian Sea when a 20mm
nose gun on an A-7E Corsair fighter-bomber fired inadvertently
during maintenance, touching off an explosion and fire that damaged
seven aircraft.
   Scott Dimberg, 23, of Redfield, S.D., died aboard the carrier and
Henderson suffered second- and third-degree burns in the fire.
   Emergency deck crewmen were able to contain the blaze within 20
minutes, and no damage was sustained by the 90,944-ton carrier, the
military said.

<TEXT>
   The nation's bicentennial inaugural festivities
next month have something for everyone, from glamour-seekers and
history buffs to children, chocolate lovers and ordinary citizens
trying to get in on the action.
   ``We want to make sure that everybody who wishes to can
participate,'' said Ownie McBride, a spokeswoman for the American
Bicentennial Presidential Inaugural Committee.
   George Herbert Walker Bush will be sworn in Jan. 20 as president
in the nation's 51st formal inaugural ceremony, amid U.S. flags from
1789, 1889 and 1989 and red bunting recalling George Washington's
inauguration 200 years ago.
   The oath-taking on the West Front of the Capitol, overlooking the
city and the Mall, will be a solemn contrast to four days full of
official and unofficial parties, pageants, balls, receptions, galas,
salutes, celebrations and festivals.
   Stephen Studdert, director of the presidential inaugural
committee, has said the Bush inauguration will feature more free
activities than ever before. A sketchy schedule released last week
shows at least three major events for children and youth, including
a festival entitled ``George to George _ Two Hundred Years.''
   Some of the capital's best known landmarks will once again be the
sites of inaugural balls, including the National Air and Space
Museum, the Kennedy Center and the grandly restored Union Station.
   The inaugural planners' goal of broad participation is in keeping
with the open, relaxed style of George and Barbara Bush. But there
will be glamour aplenty, what with nine balls and innumerable other
upscale events.
   Roll Call, the weekly Capitol Hill newspaper, published a special
inauguration preview section suggesting ``10 places to throw your
inaugural party'' and noting that ``for inaugural week, a limo can
be a must.'' The newspaper also canvassed fashion experts at local
department stores and concluded that inaugural dress this year will
run to ``ultra-formal, sophisticated classics.''
   Capital area hotels are pulling out all the stops for
inauguration week guests, with special menus, patriotic decorations
and individual perks including chocolate elephant lollipops, white
chocolate replicas of the White House and six-inch square chocolate
pianos filled with sweets.
   ``It's a grand piano. The lid is up. The truffles and goodies are
inside the piano where the strings would be,'' explained Park Hyatt
spokeswoman Jan Walker. ``You can eat the whole blooming piano.''
   Officials at the Presidential Inaugural Committee declined to
discuss how much money they hope to raise to pay for the
festivities. The price tag could be higher than ever before, since a
new law requires the committee to reimburse the Pentagon for its
expenses in helping plan, staff and execute inaugural activities.
   President Reagan's 1985 inauguration committee raised more than
$12 million to pay for its events, but a congressional study found
that the use of federal employees cost taxpayers another $15.5
million.
   The Pentagon alone spent $10 million and used 8,400 military
personnel who served as chauffeurs and escorts, musicians and
coat-checkers, photographers and even organizers of receiving lines.
   The two exceptions to the reimbursement rule are the inaugural
ceremony and a lunch for the president, vice president and
congressional leaders, both traditionally organized by the Joint
Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.
   The committee will distribute 70,000 inaugural tickets to
Congress, 40,000 to Republicans and another 30,000 to the press,
governors, diplomats and other customary guests.
   ``If if's too cold to have it outside, the guest list goes from
140,000 to approximately 950,'' the amount that will fit inside the
Capitol Rotunda, said congressional committee director Mike
Ruehling. He said preparations for an indoor ceremony will be made
in advance, ``which guarantees that it won't happen.''
   While Reagan took his first oath outside the Capitol in balmy
55-degree weather, a record high for Inauguration Day, his second
inaugural ceremony was forced indoors due to a record low
temperature of 7 degrees. The parade was canceled, to the
disappointment of hundreds of thousands of prospective spectators
and young marching band members.
   There was one inaugural week parade in 1985 _ a Rainbow Coalition
march down Pennsylvania Avenue led by Jesse Jackson, a two-time
contender for the Democratic presidential nomination.
   Jackson capped the march by blasting Reagan for ``taking from the
poor and giving to the rich'' and characterized the inaugural
goings-on as ``vulgar expressions of ostentatiousness, private
airplanes and long limousines and $25,000 dresses and diamonds from
South Africa.''
   This year the mood is somewhat different. Jackson lunched with
Bush at the White House last week and came away smiling. ``I'm
impressed with the vice president's openness,'' he said. ``Whatever
I can do in some role, I would.''

   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci
arrived in Oman today to begin a four-day tour including visits to
Navy warships and stops in three other Persian Gulf countries.
   Carlucci was quoted by the official Omani News Agency as saying
his trip was to reaffirm the Reagan administration's interest in
continuing strong ties with Oman and ``renewing the commitment for
stability in the region.''
   Oman, on the far eastern end of the Persian Gulf, is one of the
four Arab states that has provided the United States with limited
support facilities for its naval operations in the waterway.
   The arrangements are a particularly sensitive matter in Oman,
which shares control of the strategic Strait of Hormuz with Iran and
has the closest ties of any gulf Arab state with Tehran.
   The Omanis permit the U.S. Navy to refuel warships at a base on
the Arabian Sea and have access to other facilities that U.S.
officials refuse to discuss.
   Carlucci, after attending a meeting of NATO defense ministers in
Belgium, flew to Muscat for a two-day visit at the invitation of
Oman's Defense Minister, Mutassim Bin Hamoud Busaidi. He was
accompanied by Assistant Defense Secretary Richard Armitage and
several other officials.
   Carlucci also was to visit the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz,
operating in the Arabian Sea off Oman. On Wednesday, an explosion
and fire aboard the huge carrier killed one sailor. A second sailor,
who was seriously wounded, died Friday night in a U.S. military
hospital in West Germany, officials said.
   Seven aircraft were damaged in the accident, which occurred when
a 20mm nose gun on a Corsair fighter-bomber fired inadvertently
during maintenance, the Navy said. It hit a KA6-D Intruder tanker
plane loaded with aviation fuel.
   After Oman, Carlucci was to fly to Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait to meet with top officials, probably for the last time before
the Reagan administration leaves office in January. He was due back
in Washington on Wednesday.
   President-elect George Bush has said he will name his own man to
replace Carlucci, who assumed the Pentagon post about a year ago.

   A police inspector who took the day off to go
fishing Saturday caught a real whopper _ a sack of stolen jewels
weighing about two pounds, police sources said.
   The officer, who was not named, was fishing on the Rhone River
near the village of Pierre-Benite, a suburb of Lyon, when his line
caught something he believed was dinner.
   Reeling it in, he found a bag hung on the line containing
necklaces and rings of precious stones and bracelets of lesser
value, police said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Police speculated that thieves had selected the most valuable
pieces and tossed the rest in the river. They said the difference in
the value of the jewels indicated they had come from different
robberies.
   They did not provide a value for the jewels or other details.

<TEXT>
   A resegregation campaign by
right-wing town councils is prompting many whites, including
government leaders, to denounce racist practices that are legal and
a few years ago were commonplace.
   In effect, the revival of hard-line apartheid launched in
Boksburg and half-dozen other towns in the past week has provided
whites with a mirror reflecting how blacks nationwide have been
treated in recent decades.
   To a large extent, whites don't like what they see.
   ``I feel so embarrassed to be from Boksburg,'' said Pam Berry, a
housewife, at a meeting convened Thursday by residents opposed to
the Conservative Party majority which took over the town council in
elections Oct. 26.
   The council voted Nov. 24 to resegregate public facilities _
including the town hall, recreation areas and a large lakeside park
_ that had been opened to all races in recent years.
   In the next few days, several other Conservative-controlled
councils announced similar plans _ one said it might impose a curfew
barring blacks from the town of Carletonville at night.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha accused the Conservative Party of an
``unnecessary emotional outburst of racism'' and said its actions
could intensify the sanctions campaign against South Africa.
Discrimination ``based merely on the color of skin'' was wrong,
Botha said.
   Yet Botha's National Party, in power for 40 years, has made no
moves to repeal laws that require racial classification of all
citizens, that allow towns to bar blacks from public facilities, and
that mandate segregation of neighborhoods, public schools and public
hospitals.
   Nationalist leaders ousted the mayor of Durban from the party
recently because he favored integration of all-white beaches.
   ``I realize there are still (whites-only) signs, but the
important point is that we are in a process of removing them,''
Botha said.
   But in Botha's home city, Johannesburg, the National
Party-controlled council has refused to integrate buses, swimming
pools and recreation centers. The last major reforms in
Johannesburg, say opposition politicians, came in 1973 when parks
and libraries were integrated.
   Pat Rogers, a spokesman for the anti-apartheid Progressive
Federal Party, termed the National Party's attitude toward the
resegregation campaign ``nonsensical hypocrisy.''
   ``If they really don't like it, why don't they abolish the
Separate Amenities Act and legislate against racial
discrimination,'' he said. ``I would give the Conservative Party
credit at least for greater honesty in this regard.''
   Many whites concerned by the Boksburg controversy have, for the
first time, taken up confrontational pressure tactics that in the
past were employed almost exclusively by anti-apartheid activists.
   Business executives have threatened to cancel planned
developments in Boksburg and other re-segregated towns. National
sports federations say they will prohibit tournaments in those towns
unless the aparthied by-laws are rescinded. Foes of the
Conservatives in Boksburg are circulating petitions denouncing the
council.
   Black leaders have encouraged a tough response to the
Conservative councils. Boksburg's black and mixed-race townships,
Vosloorus and Reiger Park, are boycotting the town's white-owned
stores to grant the council their wish for ``a white Christmas.''
   Buchanan Jantjes, chairman of the management committee of Reiger
Park, called on the National Party to abolish remaining apartheid
laws. But he commended the government for allowing integration of
many public facilities and for ``turning a blind eye'' to some
violations, such as the growing number of blacks who live illegally
in ``whites-only'' urban areas.
   The Conservatives, Jantjes said, ``are taking National Party laws
off the shelves and dusting them off.''
   At the anti-Conservative meeting Thursday night, attended by
about 300 whites, the loudest applause _ a standing ovation _ was
given to Sidwell Mofokeng, the top-ranking local official of
Boksburg's black township, Vosloorus.
   ``Vosloorus is with you,'' he told the cheering whites. ``The
struggle is ours together.''
   The next day, Mofokeng and 10 other black leaders entered the new
whites-only zone around Boksburg Lake, in a protest covered by
dozens of reporters but ignored by police.
   Clive Derby-Lewis, a Conservative member of Parliament, described
the controversy about Boksburg as ``media hysteria'' and noted that
public facilities are segregated in the constituences of many
prominent Nationalist leaders.
   Said another Conservative lawmaker, Koos van der Merwe: ``The
National Party has opened so few facilities, there is little for the
Conservative Party to close.''

   Looking for something fashionable yet practical
for the woman who lives a life of danger?
   Give her bullet-resistant furs, in a wide variety of styles.
   The furs are lined with Kevlar, a synthetic fiber that is five
times stronger than its weight in steel and is used in bullet-proof
vests worn by police.
   ``I see the full fur coats being worn by movie stars, actresses,
Ivana Trump-types, Barbara Bush, maybe even Imelda Marcos,'' said
Stephen D'Andrilli, president of Guardian Group International, and a
distributor of Kevlar.
   As he spoke, a Joan Collins look-alike swept into the showroom of
Jiuliana Originals Inc. in a full-length $80,000 Russian sable coat.
Another model followed in a three-quarter-length $8,500 fox jacket
of light brown and white-flecked fur.
   ``A Madonna-rock-star-type would wear a coat like this,'' said
furrier Thomas F. Zizzo. He and his mother, Jiuliana Zizzo, designed
the coats.
   A woman in jeans modeled a butter-soft black leather bomber
jacket lined with reversible black mink and Kevlar, which retails
for $5,500.
   ``We don't want someone to buy a coat they wouldn't want to
wear,'' Zizzo said. ``They can wear these coats every day, so they
can utilize the protection.''
   ``We can do anything,'' Zizzo said. ``If Imelda Marcos wanted
shoes, we could do bullet-resistant shoes for her.''

   And opening the windows? Well, that's another story.
   ``When it gets cold, it's hard to sit at your desk. We keep the
coffee pots going eight hours a day up here. The secretaries have
these heavy coats on at their typewriters,'' said Liz Cleveland,
whose office is on the 13th floor.
   It's been about two months since the demise of the fans that run
the heating and cooling system at the top of one of downtown
Jackson's tallest buildings.
   While it's cold in the mornings, sunlight streaming through the
windows causes the temperature to soar during the day.
   ``What we've been doing is prying open the windows in the
afternoon, but on the 13th floor, it's like sitting in the cockpit
of a helicopter,'' said Cleveland, manager of the state Department
of Economic Development's export-import office. ``One day my door
blew shut and all the ceiling tiles blew out of my office.''
   New fans had to be specially ordered, so the top floors probably

<TEXT>
   A Soviet delegation arrived in Israel
today to bring home five Soviet hijackers who commandeered a jet in
southern Russia and flew to Tel Aviv with a hostage air crew.
   The 19-member delegation will remain in Israel until the five
hijackers, who seized a busload of children and then traded the
cargo for a plane and $3.3 million ransom, are extradited. Israel
has not announced a decision on extradition but has indicated it
will comply with the Soviet request.
   The hijackers were held in a prison near Tel Aviv pending a final
decision on extradition. A spokesman at Ben-Gurion Airport near this
coastal city said the captured eight-member crew would leave for the
Soviet Union on Sunday.
   State-run Israel radio said the Soviet delegation includes police
investigators and doctors who will examine the hijackers and crew.
   ``Some officials from the Soviet Union have come to pick up the
hijackers,'' said Motti Amihai, a spokesman for the Foreign
Ministry. ``But there has been no final decision on the Israeli
side.'' He added, ``Our policy is we don't see any reason to keep
the hijackers.''
   Israel has no extradition treaty with the Soviet Union, but both
nations have signed international agreements on punishing and
extraditing hijackers.
   In Moscow, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Boris N. Chaplin said
his country was grateful to Israel ``for their understanding on this
matter.'' Some Israeli observers said cooperation on the hijacking
could accelerate the process of reconciliation between the countries.
   The hijackers, four men and a woman, surrendered to Israeli
police and freed the crew Friday evening after landing at
Ben-Gurion. The surrender came at 6:15 p.m., 35 minutes after the
Aeroflot Ilyushin-76 set down.
   The five Soviets stepped off the plane clutching bags stuffed
with money, then dumped coins and paper bills _ most of it in
American currency _ onto the tarmac to show they weren't carrying
explosives.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the hijackers had a sawed-off
shotgun and four pistols. But one of the hostages, flight engineer
Yuri N. Yermilov, said the hijackers were not threatening and seemed
``quite good-natured.''
   ``They were five simple criminals who wanted to flee the Soviet
Union,'' Israel's chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, said at an
impromptu news conference a few yards from the jet.
   Military vehicles surrounded the plane, which sat under the glare
of a yellow searchlight.
   The episode began Thursday, according to Soviet officials in
Moscow.
   They said hijackers seized a bus with 30 school-children and a
teacher that day and demanded a plane to take them out of the
country. The bus seizure occurred in Ordzhonikidze, a city 900 miles
southeast of Moscow.
   In addition to giving the hijackers a plane and a flight crew,
the government handed over 2 million rubles, worth about $3.3
million, and some food in return for release of the children and
teacher.
   Chaplin and Vitaly A. Ponomarev, deputy KGB chief, said the
Soviet leadership including President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had been
kept closely informed of details of the operation.
   Ponomarev identified the ringleader as 38-year-old Pavel L.
Yakshiants and said he was a drug-user who first asked to go to
Pakistan.
   Israeli soldiers said much of the money carried by the hijackers
was U.S. currency. The soldiers helped scoop it up after it was
dumped on the ground, and the hijackers held tightly to the bags as
they were led to the Abu Kabir prison near Tel Aviv.
   Israel radio said the hijack team was made up of two Russians,
two Armenians and a person from the Soviet Ossetian republic near
Turkey.
   The Soviets broke diplomatic relations with Israel after the 1967
Middle East war when Israel seized lands from Moscow's Arab allies.
   A gradual thaw in relations began in July 1987 when the Soviet
Union sent a consular delegation to Tel Aviv. Israel set up a
delegation in Moscow in April.

<HEAD>Pollution Ravages China, Cleanup Costs Increasing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's breakneck economic development is
endangering the country's environment and saddling society with a
huge cleanup bill, the leading paper said Saturday.
   The People's Daily reported that ``if forceful policies are not
implemented,'' the nation faces a future of denuded forests, dirty
lakes, barren grasslands and smoggy skies.
   The report said the twin evils of pollution and misuse of natural
resources have reached such a state in China that annual cleanup
costs are estimated at about $23 billion.
   ``By the end of the century,'' the paper said, ``if the
environment continues to worsen, it will become a major factor
limiting economic development.''
   The paper said about 1 percent of the country's $270 billion
gross national product _ or $2.7 billion _ should be devoted each
year to ecology.
   But the Xinhua news agency reported that by October only $1.8
billion had been allocated for the purpose, although it said the
state planned an increase of 50 percent in coming years.
   Since 1978, China's gross national product has jumped 100
percent, but the economic and industrial growth has come at an
enormous ecological cost _ one which the government has only
recently begun to realize.
   A Xinhua report said that by the year 2000, nearly half of
China's 2,800 lakes could be polluted. An earlier survey on 58,900
miles of rivers found that 20 percent were polluted and another 8
percent seriously contaminated.
   Reports have blamed acid rain, caused by burning the high-sulfur
coal that predominates in China, for killing trees in Hangzhou, a
beautiful lakeside metropolis south of Shanghai.
   In the countryside, increased use of chemical fertilizers has
seriously affected soil quality and water resources. In addition,
``timber poachers,'' who raid forests for firewood and building
materials, have been fingered in the country's continuing problem
with deforestation.
   The People's Daily said Saturday's report was based on a
four-year study to forecast environmental conditions in the year
2000.
   The report said that even if ``forceful policies'' were adopted,
China would only be able to treat 53 percent of its liquid waste by
the turn of the century. It now treats only about 20 percent of the
waste.
   In addition, the study predicted acid rain would continue to
plague highly industrialized areas and the output of solid waste
would more than double by 2000.
   The report said that damage to farmland accounted for the lion's
share of the annual financial cleanup cost, demanding about $9.7
billion dollars a year. Water pollution came next, accounting for
$4.2 billion in damage annually.
   Third came the financial loss from denuded forests, followed by
air pollution, problems caused by chemical fertilizers and the
destruction of water resources.

<TEXT>
   Panic buying of salt hit China's southern city
of Canton, sending its prices soaring in some privately run food
stores, a pro-Beijing newspaper reported Saturday.
   The Chinese-language New Evening Post said the price rises
violated regulations and the merchants would be held responsible.
The report did not elaborate.
   Rumors that vouchers would be needed to buy salt resulted in long
customer lines outside several food stores in Canton recently, the
newspaper said.
   Canton is about 90 miles west of this British colony.
   The price of salt rose from 10 cents to 35 cents at the stores,
the newspaper reported without giving the unit of measure of the
salt.
   Provincial and city governments said warehouses were stocked and
no voucher program existed, the newspaper reported.
   China's economic reform policy has been slowed by inflation that
has soared to a post-1950s high of more than 26 percent.
   There have been recent reports of panic buying of textiles in
Shanghai and salt in 19 areas, where authorities immediately imposed
rations.

   Two veteran Florida Highway Patrol
troopers who flew an agency plane into restricted airspace for a
closer look at the space shuttle Discovery Sept. 29 will be
suspended up to two days, authorities said.
   Maj. Withrop Vincent and Sgt. Gary Schluter, the pilot, ``flew 45
miles out of their flight path expressly to view the launch'' at
Kennedy Space Center, Maj. Mike Kirby said Friday. ``That's not
acceptable.''
   The troopers, who were headed to Orlando on official business the
morning of the mission, entered restricted airspace before the
launch but left before liftoff, federal authorities said. No charges
were filed.
   Vincent, a troop commander in West Palm Beach, will be suspended
without pay for two days, Kirby said. Schluter will be suspended for
one day.
   The troopers were relieved of duty when the investigation began
but returned to work Oct. 25, Kirby said.

<HEAD>Strongest Opposition Party Splinters And Expells Chairman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The strongest political group opposing
Burma's military rulers split Saturday and expelled its chairman,
who has formed a new party.
   Leaders of the National League for Democracy expelled Aung Gyi
after he asked the party on Nov. 25 to remove eight communist or
pro-communist members, accusing them of ``engaging in activities
detrimental to the interest of the league as well as that of the
democratic process.''
   Aung Gyi said he would ``continue the struggle for democracy''
under the banner of a new party, the Union National Democracy Party.
   After the chairman's expulsion, the pro-communist members were
allowed to retain membership in the National League for Democracy.
   The party was formed Sept. 27 by Aung Gyi and two other
opposition leaders, Aung San Suu Kyi and Gen. Tin Oo, to oppose
Burma's military rulers. The opposition also contests the general
elections planned by the ruling National Unity Party which, under
another name, has governed Burma since a 1962 military coup as the
sole legal party.
   More than 500,000 people have enrolled as members of the National
League for Democracy, making it the strongest of the opposition
groups.
   Western analysts have said the opposition must unify to defeat
the ruling party.
   Following weeks of violence and pro-democracy demonstrations, the
military under Gen. Saw Maung staged a Sept. 18 coup and ruthlessly
put down pro-democracy opponents. By official count, his troops have
killed more than 450 people since the coup.
   The general has promised general elections and allowed 157
political parties to register, but no election date has been set.
   Opposition leaders say the tight control over virtually every
aspect of life indicates free and fair elections will not be
possible.
   Aung San Suu Kyi is the daughter of assassinated national hero
Aung San. Tin Oo is a former defense minister fired by former rule
Ne Win, who seized power in the 1962 military coup and led Burma for
26 years on a road of isolation, political repression and economic
ruin.
   Ne Win formally retired in July, but diplomats say he still is
the real power in Burma. After Ne Win's resignation, two other
leaders preceded Saw Maung, whose rise to power diplomats believe
was engineered by the former leader.

<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet officials and Afghan
guerrillas today began informal talks on prisoners of war, the
future relationship between Afghanistan and Moscow and the future of
the Soviet-backed Kabul government.
   The face-to-face talks in Taif, a Saudi Arabian resort 600 miles
from Riyadh, were the first between the Soviets and a seven-group
guerrilla alliance since the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
The Soviets have met other rebel groups on two occasions earlier
this year.
   Formal negotiations were expected to begin later today or Sunday,
sources close to the talks said.
   Saudi Arabia was chosen as a venue by the Afghan resistance
groups because of the influence it wields in the Islamic world.
   The kingdom has said repeatedly it would consider establishing
ties with Moscow only after Soviet troops complete their withdrawal
from Afghanistan. The Soviets intervened there in December 1979.
   The head of the Soviet delegation was Yuli Vorontsov, a deputy
foreign minister who recently was named ambassador to Afghanistan,
the sources said on condition of anonymity.
   Burhanuddin Rabbani, leader of the loose alliance of Afghan
resistance groups based in Peshawar, Pakistan, has been in the
kingdom for two weeks. Other rebel leaders were expected to join the
official talks later.
   Vorontsov is the second Soviet official to visit Saudi Arabia in
less than a year. Vladimir Polyakov, another deputy foreign
minister, came in February in what was seen then as a move toward
rapprochement between the two countrues.
   Rabbani has stressed that the overriding focus for the rebels
during the talks will be on complete withdrawal of Soviet troops
from Afghanistan.
   More than half of the 100,000 troops have left since Moscow and
Pakistan signed a U.N.-sponsored accord in April calling for
withdrawal.
   The rest of the troops were supposed to be out by Feb. 15, but
the Soviets recently halted the withdrawal to protest what they
called continued funding of the guerrillas by Pakistan and the
United States.
   Moscow and the Marxist government of President Najib are now
seeking to convene an international conference to demilitarize
Afghanistan and set up a coalition government with the rebels.
   Vladimir Petrovsky, also a Soviet deputy foreign minister, told
reporters in Moscow on Friday that the Vorontsov-Rabbani meeting was
arranged by the Saudi government with the cooperation of the Afghan
government.
   He said no representatives of Najib's government or Pakistan, the
main backer of the rebels, will attend the meeting.

   Israeli troops shot and killed a Palestinian boy
and wounded 20 Arabs today as stone-throwing rioters clashed with
soldiers in the occupied territories, Arab reports and hospital
officials said.
   An army spokeswoman confirmed the death and said several
Palestinians were wounded. She said she could not give an exact
number of wounded.
   In response to the unrest, the army clamped curfews on three West
Bank towns and barred reporters from entering Nablus which, with
100,000 Arab residents, is the West Bank's largest city.
   The 16-year-old boy was killed in Nablus when troops opened fire
on demonstrators who erected barricades and hurled rocks and bottles
at soldiers, the army said. Arab reports said the boy was taken to
the city's Ittihad Hospital after he was shot in the neck and chest.
   The youth's death raised to at least 318 the number of Arabs
killed since the start of the yearlong Palestinian uprising against
Israel's military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Eleven
Israelis also have died.
   A 27-year-old man was shot in the head with a plastic bullet in
Nablus and taken to Ramallah Hospital where he was in critical
condition, a hospital official said.
   In the Gaza Strip, Arab witnesses said troops shot and wounded at
least five youths when nearly 100 demonstrators threw rocks at cars
and soldiers outside a Palestinian elementary school. The army said
it was checking the report.
   Witnesses said soldiers opened fire with rubber bullets and live
ammunition when stone-throwing youths outside the school in Khan
Yunis refused to disperse. The youngest of the wounded was an
11-year-old boy shot in the right leg with a plastic bullet, Arab
reports said.

<HEAD>Grand Jury May Hand Up PTL Indictments Next Week, Sources Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal grand jury investigating Jim
Bakker and former associates at PTL may return indictments this
week, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   Unidentified sources told The Charlotte Observer on Friday that
they believe prosecutors are ready to end the 17-month investigation
and intend to present an indictment for the grand jury to consider.
   ``I would guess they're going to come back with an indictment
next week. I don't know what day,'' a source told The Observer.
   Bakker's attorney, Jim Toms, who has met with prosecutors, said
he believes Bakker will be charged with mail and wire fraud
involving PTL ``lifetime partnerships'' and with tax violations in
connection with PTL money spent on Bakker.
   Lifetime partners received free lodging at PTL's Christian theme
park in Fort Mill, S.C., in exchange for big contributions to the
evangelical empire built by Jim and Tammy Bakker before his downfall
in a sex and money scandal in 1987.
   Prosecutors have reserved a courtroom for Monday through
Wednesday for the grand jury to meet. Toms and other sources said
they believe prosecutors on Monday will explain what charges they
believe ought to be brought.
   U.S. Attorney Tom Ashcraft refused to discuss the secret
proceedings.
   Last month, Bakker, former PTL executive Richard Dortch and Roe
Messner, PTL's former chief builder, received letters from
prosecutors informing them that they are targets of the
investigation and inviting them to testify.
   Only Messner, a Wichita, Kan., contractor, accepted. He refused
to talk with reporters after testifying Wednesday and Thursday.
   Bakker resigned from PTL in a scandal over the payment of hush
money to Jessica Hahn, with whom he had a sexual encounter in a
hotel room in 1980.

<HEAD>Congressman Complains Social Security Refusing To Spend Money For
Homeless</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Social Security Administration has bottled
up money to be spent on the homeless at the same time the agency's
head is considering spending some $1.6 million on souvenir
certificates, a congressman complained.
   The attack leveled by Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., at Social Security
Commissioner Dorcas Hardy comes at a time she is quietly campaigning
for a post in the administration of President-elect George Bush.
   However, Weiss, chairman of the House Government Operations
subcommittee on human resources, denied that his criticism _
contained in a letter to Bush _ was designed to derail Hardy's
career.
   He urged Bush to ``reject the misplaced priorities'' of Hardy.
   Weiss said he and his subcommittee have had differences with
Hardy on other matters ``at a time when there was never any question
about her continuation in office.''
   Meanwhile, on a different matter, Hardy announced Saturday that
she has rejected a controversial draft proposal to narrow disability
applicants' appeal rights.
   She said she remains convinced that the disability appeals
process needs reforms, but said the low-level staff proposal _ which
was leaked to a newspaper two weeks ago before reaching her desk _
was not equitable, compassionate or efficient.
   Weiss said Hardy has not acted on part of a 1987 budget act
authorizing $1.25 million last year and $2.5 million this year in
grants for homeless outreach projects.
   Hardy has argued that Congress failed to provide money for the
program and that it duplicated other government services.
   She recommended that the Department of Health and Human Services
seek repeal of the program or find an agency more familiar with
state grant programs to run it.
   Congress wanted states to use the money to find and help homeless
people eligible for benefits, particularly the mentally and
physically disabled who are entitled to Supplemental Security
Income, Weiss said in the Dec. 2 letter.
   ``It's really the season that warrants it,'' he said in an
interview. ``Here we are with winter upon us. There are people out
on the streets who are obviously and clearly qualified for SSI
benefits. The purpose of the legislation was to help states reach
out and identify those individuals. ... We felt we ought to bring it
to the attention of the president-elect.''
   Phil Gambino, a spokesman for the Social Security Administration,
said Congress not only failed to allocate money for the outreach
grant program but in fact gave the agency less money in its overall
budget than it requested for fiscal 1988 and 1989.
   ``Therefore we have to rely on other alternative means'' to reach
the homeless, Gambino said. He said employees at the 1,300 SSA
offices nationwide work closely with shelters and advocacy groups to
make sure the homeless receive benefits.
   ``Commissioner Hardy is very much concerned that we deliver our
services compassionately and fairly to the homeless. We think we're
doing a good job of it,'' Gambino said.
   Weiss called that claim ``baloney. ... They're not doing any kind
of outreach that I can see. Obviously it was the congressional view
that the kind of work that was needed was not being done.''
   He said there was no specific allocation because Congress assumed
the agency would fund the relatively tiny grant program from its
general budget.
   At the same time she was fighting the homeless program, Weiss
said, Hardy was supporting a $1.6 million plan to send decorative
certificates, suitable for framing, to Social Security
beneficiaries. Hardy approved the plan despite a recommendation to
scrap it, according to documents supplied by Weiss' office.
   ``It's a nutty idea,'' Weiss said. ``It contrasts what she thinks
money ought to be spent for as opposed to what the real needs of
people are.''
   Gambino said Hardy still thinks the certificates are a good idea
but they haven't been instituted. ``We haven't killed the proposal,
but it is not a high priority at this time based on its cost and our
funding situation,'' he said.

   President Raul Alfonsin said today
the government will not negotiate with more than 400 heavily armed
soldiers who took over a giant military base near the capital.
   Alfonsin, who returned home from the United States today to deal
with the crisis, met with his Cabinet and top military aides.
   Jose Ignacion Lopez, Alfonsin's spokesman, told reporters the
president ``gave the necessary instructions to re-establish
discipline and order where it has broken down and hopes that the
problem will be resolved.''
   Lopez would not disclose the orders but said Alfonsin would not
speak with the rebels, as he did to end a similar insurrection in
April 1987.
   At the sprawling Campo de Mayo army base, rebels remained in
control of an infantry school, surrounded by loyalist troops backed
by tanks and mortars.
   The government claimed on Friday that the uprising, in which one
soldier reportedly was killed, ``had been overcome.''
   However, a spokesmen for rebel leader Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin
insisted the rebels had only agreed on a truce pending Alfonsin's
return from a three-day trip to Mexico and the United States.
   At Campo de Mayo on the outskirts of Buenos Aires talks continued
between Seineldin and Gen. Francisco Gassino, commander of the loyal
forces who surrounded the rebel position at an infantry school.
   The Rev. Luis Jardin, a Roman Catholic priest who claimed to be a
friend of Seineldin, left the infantry school today and told the
private news agency Noticias Argentinas the rebels had agreed to ``a
truce of several days.''
   ``Seineldin has not surrendered nor does he intend to,'' said
Jardin.
   The rebels would consider any movement of loyalist forces a
violation of the truce, he said.
   Vice President Victor Martinez was quoted as saying on Friday
that Seineldin ``accepted absolute responsibility for the
episodes,'' and he claimed the uprising had ended.
   ``The insubordinate soldiers at the infantry school at the Campo
de Mayo now accept the orders of the army chief (of staff Gen. Jose
Dante Caridi),'' the Defense Ministry said in a communique Friday.
   But it remained uncertain whether the uprising was over because
Seineldin was permitted to return to the infantry school, Martinez
was quoted as saying.
   Noticias Argentinas quoted reporters at the base after midnight
as saying they ``very clearly heard a series of 15 or 20 detonations
of light arms fire.'' The agency did not elaborate.
   The insurrection began before dawn Thursday when about 50 members
of a coast guard unit armed themselves and deserted their station.
Army officers tried to incite troops at one army base and another
communications facility. The latter two attempts failed.
   The coast guard unit then drove onto the infantry school grounds
Friday morning, joining rebel soldiers. The government said the
rebels also tried to free ex-Lt. Col. Aldo Rico, leader of the most
recent uprisings in April 1987 and January. He is being held in a
military prison pending trial.
   Machine guns were positioned at Government House in downtown.
   The navy, air force, and army remained loyal. Tanks and armored
personnel carriers were sent toward the Campo de Mayo to quell the
uprising, Gen. Luis Caceres was quoted as saying by local news
reports.
   After firing mortars at the rebels, which Seineldin said numbered
400, one officer was reported killed _ it was not clear from which
side _ and about five soldiers were wounded, the official news
agency Telam said.
   A 19-year-old woman was hit by bullets in the neck and stomach as
she walked near the base, Argentina's two private news agencies
reported. Her condition was not known.
   The rebel demands were not clear.
   The news agencies cited military and rebel sources as saying
rebels want to end the prosecution of fellow officers accused of
rights abuses during the 1976-83 military rule, as well as gain
better pay and equipment.

<HEAD>Year after Gunman Brought Down Jet, Airport Security Has Improved</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   One year after a fired airline employee
smuggled a gun aboard a jet to kill his former boss, traces of the
crash that killed 43 people have disappeared from a cow pasture but
left their mark on the nation's airports.
   Since the Dec. 7, 1987, crash of Pacific Southwest Airlines
Flight 1771, all airline employees, including uniformed pilots, must
pass through security checkpoints.
   The FBI has closed its criminal investigation and the National
Transportation Safety Board is expected to issue its report this
month.
   In April, the Federal Aviation Administration proposed
computed-coded cards that would allow employees only into areas
where they work. The system would reject cards of former employees
and note when someone tries to reach a restricted area.
   The FAA has yet to require the computerized system, said FAA
spokesman Fred Farrar. But Los Angeles International Airport, where
Flight 1771 originated, has adopted a similar computer-aided card
that gives security guards instant access to information about the
employee, who must also give a personal identification number.
   The airport also plans to erect concrete barriers and fences
topped with barbed wire to keep intruders off the airfield, said
manager Steve Yee.
   Could a gunman carry a weapon onto Flight 1771 today?
   ``Nothing is absolutely impossible but it would be extremely more
difficult to accomplish that,'' said Clifton Moore, airport
executive director.
   Farrar also called it unlikely, adding, ``At that time he
shouldn't have gotten through, but he apparently used a card that he
kept after he was fired.''
   David Augustus Burke, 35, of Long Beach, a 14-year USAir
employee, smuggled a .44-caliber Magnum revolver aboard the plane
that day and probably shot both pilots en route to San Francisco,
federal authorities said.
   The cockpit voice recorder picked up six shots and fell silent
with the plane at 22,000 feet. In seconds, the BAe 146 four-engine
jetliner smashed into the pasture, killing all aboard.
   Burke's airline badge was found amid the wreckage, providing a
clue to how he bypassed security with the gun. USAir maintains Burke
turned in his badge.
   Burke had been fired as a ticket agent three weeks earlier by
USAir, PSA's parent company, for allegedly stealing $69 in cocktail
receipts. Raymond Thomson, 48, Burke's former boss was on the plane.
   Investigators at the crash site found a note on an air sickness
bag that read: ``Hi Ray, I think it's sort of ironical that we end
up like this. I asked for some leniency for my family, remember.
Well I got none and you'll get none.''
   At least 31 lawsuits have been filed on behalf of passengers'
survivors, according to attorney Mimi Blakeslee. Many of the cases
were consolidated and are scheduled for trial May 1. Several cases
have been settled.
   In June, a granite and bronze memorial was erected at a Southern
California cemetery where 11 never-identified victims are buried.
   Bill Hartzell has reseeded his pockmarked pasture.
   ``You'd never be able to tell that anything happened,'' said Sgt.
Jim Mulhall with the San Luis Obispo County Sheriff's Department.
``It looks like any other hillside.''
   Gloria Gottesman of Veradale, Wash., whose daughter Julie was
killed in the crash, said she remembers taking the 20-year-old
flight trainee to the airport a week earlier. She watched pilots
walk unchecked through security and recalled thinking, ``Boy, if you
wanted to sabotage a plane it'd be really easy to do it.''
   Like other relatives, she remains bitter about the security
system that allowed Burke to smuggle the gun aboard. ``It would be
nice if it didn't happen; if they were doing their job,'' she said.
``Who can say? It's just a damned shame.''
   Burke's mother said her son is missed. ``I don't believe he do
any of those things,'' she said in a telephone interview from her
home in Rochester, N.Y. ``I don't know what to say. What happened,
only the Lord knows.''

   Voters in this country hard-hit by a
drop in oil prices will choose from two dozen presidential
candidates in Sunday's election, including a liberal front-runner, a
conservative and a witch doctor.
   Opinion polls have consistently projected Carlos Andres Perez, a
former president, solidly ahead in the contest but with his
left-of-center Democratic Action Party expected to lose its
congressional majority.
   Independent polls gave Perez a lead between 12 and 15 percent
points until last week. But aides of conservative Social Christian
rival Eduardo Fernandez claimed early this week both had 41 percent
of the those polled.
   An estimated 10 percent of the nation's more than 9 million
voters were still undecided, according to independent polls.
   Perez, a 66-year-old leader who nationalized the country's rich
oil industry in the mid-70s, has promised to seek ``decent repayment
terms'' on the country's $33 billion foreign debt.
   Fernandez, 48, says he represents a new generation of leadership,
embracing an unconcealed sympathy for the private sector. He plans
to sell off many state-run enterprises.
   Besides the two front-runners, 22 other candidates representing a
wide political spectrum, from the first woman candidate to a witch
doctor who follows a local Spanish-Indian goddess, also ran mostly
shoestring campaigns aiming at least to get seats in the 244-seat
national congress, all up for grabs this election.
   The Supreme Electoral Council, which oversees the electoral
process, ordered all parties to cease campaigning Friday and give
citizens a two-day break before the election.
   Estimates place the cost of the campaign at some $40 million for
each of the two major candidates, 14 times the estimated per capita
cost of the U.S. campaign.
   Confident of victory, Perez paid no attention to persistent
demands for public debates with his main rivals.
   Fernandez launched an all-out attack the last two weeks, accusing
Perez of selling out Venezuelan rights in a border dispute with
Colombia.
   Perez charged Fernandez of ``anti-patriotism'' and
``irresponsible electioneering'' for bringing it up.
   Some of the minor parties stand to win greater representation
this election according to polls, a swing away from the major party
dominance of that branch of government. The gains could come at the
expense of Democratic Action's bloc of 24 out of 44 senators and 113
out of 200 deputies.
   Social Christians are expected to at least maintain their current
position with 14 senators and 60 deputies.
   Perez, 66, who governed Venezuela between 1974 and 1979, a period
of unparalleled oil affluence, could be the first to win a second
term in 30 years of democratic rule. The constitution bans
presidents from seeking re-election until 10 years after their first
mandate expires.
   Perez is responsible for at least half of the country's foreign
debt. His administration undertook major projects to develop
Venezuela's natural resources.
   Perez aides have said the former president will ask for a 30-year
repayment period from creditor banks, more than double the current
refinancing accord of 14 years.
   The foreign debt also was exacerbated by the falling price of
oil, which accounts for 90 percent of the country's exports.
   More than 50,000 troops have been placed on full alert to ensure
order at voting stations.

<HEAD>Post-Challenger Era Includes New Generation of Astronauts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Space shuttle Atlantis is carrying
two space newcomers, part of a new generation of astronauts with a
look and background unlike that of the all-white, crew-cut, All
American team who rode the Mercury capsules.
   Nine more rookies have been named to four future flights, and a
new class of astronauts is in training to fill spots vacated by
veterans who took other jobs after the shuttle Challenger exploded
on Jan. 28, 1986.
   The space program now has 93 men and women astronauts, with a
nearly even mix of experienced space travelers and those who have
never flown into space.
   Within 10 years, NASA is expected to add more as it responds to
the demand of more shuttle flights and begins construction of the
space station.
   America's new astronauts are far different from the seven
original ones.
   The first U.S. astronauts were all military test pilots, all male
and all white. All Jack Armstrongs in flight suits.
   The space shuttles, with room for up to seven crew members,
opened new opportunities.
   In 1978, NASA selected women and men, pilots and non-pilots, and
black, white, Hispanic and Asian candidates.
   The newest group, chosen last year, includes the first black
woman astronaut, Dr. Mae C. Jemison, a physician, and the first
Coast Guardsman, Bruce E. Melnick.
   Another group is scheduled to be chosen in January 1990. Despite
the loss of the seven Challenger astronauts, the number of
applications has increased since the accident, Johnson Space Center
spokesman Jeff Carr said.
   The competition seems to have stiffened over the years, said Lori
Garver, executive director of the National Space Society, a
Washington-based space advocacy group of about 20,000 people from
the general public.
   ``I don't know how it could get more competitve from the early
days, but it seems to have done just that,'' Ms. Garver said. ``They
have experience in all kinds of areas. (NASA) looks at the whole
person and what they have to offer.''
   The astroanuts are also more aggressive about voicing their
opinions about quality and safety since Challenger, said astronaut
Charles Bolden Jr., a Marine colonel. ``Now, people have no qualms
about speaking out,'' he said.
   When Challenger exploded there were 95 astronauts. More than a
dozen later retired. Some returned to their military branches;
others _ like Sally Ride, the first American woman in space _ left
NASA to pursue other careers.
   Fifteen people _ 10 military and five civilians _ were added to
the astronaut ranks in August 1987. Two of them are women, Ms.
Jemison and Jan Davis.
   It takes at least four years of training before an astronaut can
even be assigned to a flight, and crews generally are named a year
before their launch date, Ms. Davis said.
   ``I didn't understand before I came here how all-encompassing the
job is. We don't just flip switches and follow check lists. We've
got to understand what's going on with all these systems,'' said Ms.
Davis, who has a doctorate in mechanical engineering.
   Vance Brand, a civilian pilot who flew on two shuttle flights and
the Apollo-Soyuz joint mission, said there has been an evolution of
sorts in the astronaut corps, with a greater diversity of skills and
backgrounds.
   Hee said he expects even more diversity in the future.
   ``Space is like the American West, the Arctic or Antarctica. It's
a new locality where you can do all kinds of different things,''
Brand said.

   Police on Saturday arrested 77 anti-abortion
protesters for blocking a clinic while singing Christmas carols and
hymns.
   About 100 other people marched on the sidewalk in front of
Planned Parenthood's Elizabeth Campbell Center, carrying signs that
read ``Rescue in progress'' and ``Warning: Killing babies may be
hazardous to your soul.''
   Officers escorted most of those arrested to police vans but had
to carry three protesters, who will face resisting arrest charges,
said Police Chief Lawrence Whalen.
   All 77 demonstrators were booked on trespassing charges at the
Hamilton County jail.
   Two busloads of officers arrived to make the arrests and blocked
off the street in front of the clinic.
   ``With the streets being blocked off, the girls can't get in
there. They've got another day to think about it,'' said Sara Meyer,
spokeswoman for the Rescue Cincinnati group coordinating the protest.
   Ann Mitchell, executive director of Planned Parenthood in
Cincinnati, said no patients canceled appointments. She said the
protest was anticipated and patients were scheduled for appointments
later than usual.

   Yugoslavia's only nuclear power plant
has shut down because of a defect in a recently installed
transformer, the state news agency Tanjug reported Saturday.
   It said the damage at the Krsko plant in Slovenia was caused by a
short circuit between the electric equipment and the ground
connection causing a sudden drop in the power output and the
shutdown of the plant.
   The generator and the 21-kilowatt transformer were shut down
Friday night and preparations for repair were under way, Tanjug said.
   It said the transformer was installed Wednesday to replace one
damaged in a storm.
   The 632-kilowatt station has been in operation since the 1970s.

<TEXT>
   An exiled Soviet engineer and an American security
consultant say they are nearly ready to market an anti-terrorism
system designed to halt gate crashers with their own horsepower.
   ``It is quite an old Indian trap idea,'' said Alexander Gorlov,
professor of mechanical engineering at Northeastern University and
chief designer of the Terrorist Vehicle Arresting System, which can
demolish a 15,000-pound truck traveling at 50 mph.
   The trap consists of two cables and a net stretched across an
entryway. If an intruder tries to drive through, the tension on the
net and cables rotates a 1,500-pound, spiked turnstile that slams
into the side of the vehicle, forcing it against a barrier.
   After the 1986 terrorist attack that claimed the lives of 241
Marines in Beirut, security officials recognized the need for a more
reliable defense against car bomb attacks.
   Steel barricades that rise from the ground to stop intruders in
their tracks have been installed at the entrances of the Capitol,
the White House and many other government buildings in the United
States and abroad.
   Ed Newell, a Boston resident who worked as a law enforcement
consultant much of his 77 years, said those 1,500-pound barricades
are difficult to maintain.
   ``You've got to raise and lower that mass for every vehicle that
comes and goes all day long, every day, waiting for 10 years for
some guy to crash,'' Newell said. ``People walk by and they see this
thing standing there and it makes them think that these people
(inside) have a bunker mentality.''
   In the system developed by Gorlov and Newell, only the 150-pound
cables and nylon net that hang a foot off the ground need to be
raised and lowered. The cables slide into a groove in the ground at
the flip of a switch to admit authorized vehicles and can be
returned to position in one second.
   The turnstile stands at the side of the road, swinging into
action only when a gate crasher drags on the net.
   Gorlov and Newell have some testing to complete. ``But now we've
developed all the details and, practically speaking, we're ready for
mass production,'' Gorlov said.
   They said believe they can sell the recently patented system for
between $15,000 and $25,000.
   Gorlov, 56, and his wife, Ella, formerly professors at Moscow
universities, were banished from the Soviet Union 13 years ago and
settled in Brookline.
   He said he was exlied because of his friendship with Nobel
laureate Alexander Solzhenitzsyn, who chronicled Gorlov's brush with
the KGB in his novel ``The Oak and the Calf.''

<HEAD>Reforms Keep Tight Rein on Republics, Restructure Center</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet citizens got their first look Saturday at
the fine points of a new political system that keeps a tight rein on
the 15 republics, strengthens the presidency and builds a more
dynamic parliament.
   Major daily Soviet newspapers published details of the reforms,
which were approved Thursday by the Supreme Soviet parliament and
will go into effect with elections next March 26.
   The reforms, adopted after five weeks of intense public debate,
attempt to forge a compromise between demands by the republics for
autonomy and the need for central control by the government in
Moscow.
   But a lawyer for a grass-roots Lithuanian movement scoffed at
compromises made to the restive republics and said his organization
was writing a complaint over President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
reforms that will arrive at the United Nations about the same time
the Soviet leader does.
   ``All the things that choked and are choking us are still
there,'' Kazimieras Motieka, a member of the governing council of
the Sajudis movement, said in a telephone interview from the
Lithuanian capital of Vilnius.
   The new system establishes a 2,250-member Congress of People's
Deputies that will include for the first time members of the
Communist Party, trade union and other organizations as well as
representatives chosen on the basis of geographical districts and
ethnic homelands.
   The congress will choose a smaller, more active Supreme Soviet
that is to meet eight months instead of several days a year.
   Several of the 15 republics, especially the Baltic republics of
Lithuanian, Latvia and Estonia, have complained that the laws as
proposed by Gorbachev in October concentrated too much power in
Moscow.
   Motieka said the new laws give the national parliament wide power
over the economy in the republics. By including property under the
jurisdication of the national Supreme Soviet, Moscow established
``that what is in our republic is not our property,'' he said.
   ``We can't organize our own agriculture,'' he said. ``We can't
even change wages.''
   Among the articles changed in the final draft of the reform was
one opposed by republics because they said it called into question
their right to secede from the Soviet Union.
   The final version gave the Congress of People's Deputies power to
``make decisions on matters of national-state structure which are in
the jurisdiction of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.''
   Previous language had given it the power to make decisions ``on
the composition of the U.S.S.R.''
   The language appeared weaker, but Motieka contended that the
change was in words only.
   Estonia has led opposition to the constitutional changes. On Nov.
16 its Supreme Soviet made a ``declaration of sovereignty'' in
internal affairs and proclaimed its right to approve all new
national laws.
   The national government declared that move unconstitutional, but
the Estonian parliament meets Monday to discuss further expressions
of autonomy.
   The final version of the law gives republics more representatives
in one of the two houses of the Supreme Soviet and representation on
a new constitutional oversight commission.
   It orders directives of the central government to be published in
the languages of the republics.
   But it also gives the national Presidium specific powers to
ensure that the constitutions and laws of the republics correspond
to the national constitution.
   Gorbachev leaves Monday for New York, where he will address the
United Nations and meet with President Reagan and President-elect
George Bush. He then travels to Cuba and Britain.
   Motieka said the governing council of Sajudis agreed during a
session Saturday to send a complaint to the United Nations. A draft
was being written and a vote would be taken Sunday, he said.

<TEXT>
   George Bush has sized up Mikhail Gorbachev
during nearly two hours of meetings in Moscow and Washington and
concludes that the Soviet leader is tough, self-confident and
outgoing _ ``a new and more enlightened'' leader.
   At the same time there is nothing in Bush's recent marks to
contradict his year-old assessment that Gorbachev also ``is no
freedom-loving friend of democracy.''
   In contrast to President Reagan's newfound optimism about the
Soviet Union and its leadership, Bush had taken a more cautious
approach. ``The cold war is not over,'' Bush said earlier this year,
even as he praised Gorbachev's reforms as revolutionary.
   From his personal experience, Bush knows Gorbachev can be a real
crowd pleaser _ in Bush's words, ``a Western-style communicator.''
   During the superpower summit last December, Bush was along for
the ride in Gorbachev's limousine when the Soviet leader abruptly
ordered his driver to halt, jumped out of the car and plunged into a
noontime crowd in downtown Washington.
   The campaign-style stop delighted onlookers who rushed to greet
Gorbachev. Bush, then a candidate, shared Gorbachev's limelight,
joining him on the street to shake hands and wave.
   On Wednesday, Bush will fly to New York to accompany Reagan at a
meeting with Gorbachev on Governors Island in New York Harbor.
   Although Bush will be the man Gorbachev will have to deal with
after Jan. 20, the vice president promises he'll play a back seat
role to Reagan in New York.
   ``It will be President Reagan's meeting,'' Bush says. ``I'll be
there as vice president of the United States and I expect they'll be
aware they're talking to the next president.''
   Colin Powell, the White House national security adviser, said the
Soviets understand that Bush's role will be secondary to Reagan's
and that ``it would not be appropriate then for the vice president
to have a separate agenda.''
   Even so, the meeting provides an important opportunity for a
smooth transition in superpower relations.
   Bush was the first American leader to meet with Gorbachev after
he became head of the Soviet government.
   As Reagan's emissary, Bush went to Moscow in March, 1985, for the
funeral of Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko. At the conclusion of
that trip, Bush met with the newly named Soviet leader: Gorbachev.
   The meeting lasted 85 minutes and Bush described their
discussions as ``useful'' and ``constructive.''
   Bush and Gorbachev saw each other again during the Washington
summit. Bush was present in each of the plenary sessions during the
three days of talks between Gorbachev and Reagan.
   During that summit, Bush also had a private, 23-minute meeting
with Gorbachev at the Soviet Embassy in Washington before the two
men attended breakfast with other guests. It was after that
breakfast meeting that Bush and Gorbachev rode together to the White
House and made the impromptu stop.
   At the end of the summit, when Gorbachev went to Andrews Air
Force Base to depart Washington, Bush again was in the limousine
with the Soviet leader.
   Reflecting on the summit, Bush said Gorbachev was ``an impressive
man _ self-confident, gregarious and obviously intelligent. He is
forthright and direct and he has a sense of humor and a Western
style that makes him different from his predecessors.
   ``But make no mistake about it, this is no freedom-loving friend
of democracy,'' Bush said last December. ``He is an orthodox,
committed Marxist and a formidable and determined competitor for
world power.''
   Bush has praised Gorbachev's move toward reforms, saying, ``I am
impressed by the steps he has taken for more openness, more
reform.'' However, Bush usually couples his praise with a statement
that the Soviet Union will be judged ultimately by what its actions
on arms reductions, human rights, and regional tensions.
   In some recent speeches, Bush has struck a more conciliatory tone
toward Gorbachev.
   In an address a month before the presidential election, Bush said
Gorbachev and his foreign minister, Eduard Shevardnadze, were tough
but represented ``a new and more enlightened generation of Soviet
leaders in the Kremlin _ much better able to communicate with the
West, more committed to openness and internal reform.''
   ``This offers promise but in no way should lessen our commitment
to peace through strength _ a policy we must continue,'' said Bush
   In another speech a day later, Bush again referred to Gorbachev
and Shevardnadze and said: ``They are serious people. They know they
must change. After 70 years of the Marxist-Leninist state, it's
pretty hard to explain to the Soviet people why they don't have
either bread or freedom, why the food situation is worse than it was
a decade ago, or why life expectancy has dropped.''
   Bush said Gorbachev ``is clearly a different kind of Soviet
leader than we have seen recently. He is prepared to take radical
steps. He is able to reverse course when Soviet policies fail, when
the costs become too high.''
   A week before he was elected, Bush said that should he become
president, he would be prepared to meet with Gorbachev ``at the
earliest time that would serve the interests of world peace.''
   He said he would want to engage in ``a serious and direct
examination of where we are and how we can best go forward toward
further arms reductions, a decrease in regional tensions and further
adherence to human rights and thus toward a surer peace.''

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci met
with defense officials in Oman on Saturday at the start of a
four-day Persian Gulf tour expected to be the last to the region by
a top Reagan administration official.
   Carlucci was quoted by the official Omani News Agency as saying
his trip was aimed at ``renewing the (American) commitment for
stability in the region'' in the aftermath of the 8-year-old
Iran-Iraq war.
   He was to visit Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and go aboard
several U.S. Navy warships before returning to Washington on Dec. 7,
U.S. officials said.
   They said a flight deck explosion and fire aboard the aircraft
carrier USS Nimitz four days ago was not likely to deter plans for
Carlucci to visit that ship, which is operating in the north Arabian
Sea off Oman. The accident killed two sailors.
   Navy investigators were trying to determine why a gun on an A-7E
Corsair fighter-bomber accidentally fired during an overhaul. The
gunburst hit a parked KA6-D Intruder tanker plane loaded with 4,000
gallons of aviation fuel and touched off a fire that damaged seven
aircraft.
   The Arab states on Carlucci's itinerary have provided support for
the U.S. effort to protect commercial shipping during the gulf war,
which ended in a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire Aug. 20.
   The Omanis allow U.S. Navy warships to refuel at a base on the
Arabian Sea and to have access to other facilities.
   The arrangements are a particularly sensitive matter in Oman,
which shares with Iran the control of the Strait of Hormuz, the
entrance to the gulf, and has maintained the closest ties of any
gulf state with Tehran during the war.
   Carlucci flew to Muscat, the Omani capital, accompanied by
Assistant Defense Secretary of Defense Richard Armitage and other
officials.
   On Saturday, the Pentagon chief met with Oman's defense minister,
deputy prime minister for security and defense, foreign affairs
minister and deputy prime minister for legal affairs, the official
news agency said.
   Senior U.S. officials and diplomats contend that Washington's
relations with Arab states in the Persian Gulf are the best ever as
a result of the American effort to protect shipping.
   President-elect George Bush has said he will choose his own man
to replace Carlucci, but he is expected to maintain the Reagan
administration's stated policy of scaling back U.S. forces if the
Iraq-Iran truce holds up.
   The U.S. fleet already has been trimmed by two ships since the
cease-fire, to 25 at present _ by far the largest naval force in the
region.
   The number of fleets in the gulf will be down to four by year's
end as the Netherlands and Italy pull out. The remaining fleets are
from Britain, France and the Soviet Union.
   U.S. sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Carlucci
was to visit the Nimitz, the flagship USS La Salle, the missile
cruiser USS Josephus Daniels and perhaps one of the six gulf-based
U.S. minesweepers.
   The Navy ended direct escorting of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers
two months ago, but still monitors the vessels along the 550-mile
route between Kuwait and the Strait of Hormuz.

<TEXT>
   The atmosphere for President Reagan's final
meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has brightened with
positive human rights moves in Moscow and confidence here that the
successful superpower agenda can be passed on to the Bush
administration.
   Gorbachev's decision to end the jamming of U.S.-financed Russian
language broadcasts and to ease restrictions on some Jewish
dissidents seeking exit permits symbolizes both an improved
U.S.-Soviet relationship and the ``pride of place'' human rights has
on the agenda.
   Steps by the Soviet leader to liberalize the Soviet political
system are viewed more cautiously. A foreign policy aide to
President-elect Bush said he did not think Gorbachev's
``democratization'' drive ``has any immediate bearing'' on the
meeting Wednesday on Governors Island.
   ``But as you think towards the future, the effort as it proceeds,
hopefully with application of the rule of law, it is a positive
thing,'' he said Friday. ``This and the end to jamming are the kinds
of steps that create a sense of hopefulness.''
   The Bush aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
even though Gorbachev is directing a ``process of change,'' Soviet
defense spending has not slowed and emphasized that Bush intends to
approach Moscow with considerable caution after he takes office Jan.
20.
   The Dec. 7 meeting Reagan and Bush will have with Gorbachev is
apt to be marked by goodwill and, as Secretary of State George P.
Shultz said last week, some ``substantive'' conversation.
   Apart from seeking validation of the four-part agenda that
stresses human rights, arms control and cooperation in resolving
regional disputes, Reagan will prod Gorbachev for a renewed promise
to withdraw all Soviet forces from Afghanistan by Feb. 15.
   Mindful of the Reykjavik summit two years ago, in which a bouncy
Gorbachev pressed far-reaching arms control proposals, the U.S. side
is determined not to be taken by surprise by anything the dynamic
Soviet leader might place on the luncheon table.
   ``We are prepared to deal with any surprise they may come up
with,'' Lt. Gen. Colin D. Powell, the president's national security
adviser, said Friday. That is, Powell said, ``we will take it under
advisement.''
   That indicates Reagan does not intend to swap sweeping proposals
with Gorbachev. With only six weeks left in his administration, the
president does not intend to negotiate for his successor.
   And Bush, even if he has an unscheduled separate meeting with
Gorbachev, will not be president for six weeks.
   Behind the scenes, Shultz may meet separately with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze for what would be more detailed work
than the leaders will undertake at luncheon on Governors Island.
   ``We have no major new proposals to put on the table,'' Powell
said. ``I am not aware of anything they propose to put down.''
   Reagan sent a report to Congress on Friday again accusing the
Soviets of flouting various arms control agreements with the United
States. He threatened to take some unspecified ``proportionate
response.''
   Reagan also said that unless the Soviets dismantle a disputed
radar installation in Siberia ``we cannot conclude new strategic
arms control agreements.''
   But he stopped short of charging Moscow with a ``material
breach'' of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. And he said the
Soviets corrected technical violations of the 1987 treaty to abolish
intermediate-range nuclear weapons.
   Powell said the U.S. charges were unlikely to be a ``major
issue'' at Wednesday's meeting in New York Harbor.
   The Soviet concessions on human rights could do more than
contribute to a good atmosphere for the meeting. By putting an end
to radio jamming and clearing the way for up to 120 Jewish
``refuseniks'' to emigrate, the Soviets moved closer to meeting the
U.S. test for holding a human rights conference in Moscow.
   The Reagan administration would like to see some other steps
taken. These include freeing all prisoners the United States claims
are held for political reasons, and allowing members of divided
families to emigrate.
   Gorbachev's international political moves are also getting a
positive, though cautious, reception here. They are viewed as not so
much an effort to promote democracy but to make economic
reconstruction workable.
   Still, the Soviet leader plans to establish a new legislature
with broad powers and to permit political competition, although
within the Communist Party. ``There are a lot of reasons to be
hopeful,'' the Bush foreign policy aide said.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, who has not
been allowed to leave Poland since 1981, has been given permission
to travel to France later this month, his wife said Saturday.
   The change in policy will allow him to attend a ceremony in Paris
on Dec. 10 marking the 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights.
   Walesa, who was invited by French President Francois Mitterrand,
applied for a passport last week and was informed on Saturday that
he may pick it up Monday, said Danuta Walesa, speaking from the
couple's home in Gdansk.
   Mrs. Walesa said Walesa was suffering from a flu and cold and was
unable to come to the telephone.
   ``He has gotten a passport. Someone called from the passport
office and said he can come and pick it up on Monday,'' she said.
``He's happy that he's going to France and will breathe some
different air.'' Mrs. Walesa said she would remain in Poland and
take care of the couple's eight children.
   An aide, Piotr Konopka, said Walesa would work his travel plans
out soon and decide whether to take along other members of the
banned Solidarity union.
   Foreign Minister Tadeusz Olechowski was due to return Sunday from
an official visit to France. Asked about Walesa's passport
application earlier in the week, he had said he expected it to be
issued.
   The trip would be the first time the 1983 Noble Peace Prize
winner received permission to leave Poland since the imposition of
martial law at the end of 1981. Walesa had visited Paris in October
of that year.
   Polish citizens must apply for a passport whenever they wish to
travel to a non-socialist country. Travel restrictions have been
eased in recent years, although some passports are still denied for
political reasons.
   In March, the government denied Walesa permission to attend an
international trade union conference in Australia.

   President Reagan said today he feels nostalgic
as he faces his last session with Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, and will use the meeting to introduce his successor as a
man who represents ``change, yes, but also continuity.''
   Reagan, in his weekly rado address delivered from Camp David,
Md., said he was looking forward to the upcoming meeting and
luncheon on Wednesday, set on Governors Island in New York City.
   The president recalled that since he first met the Soviet leader
in Geneva in 1985, the U.S.-Soviet relationship has developed and
resulted in the first agreement to get rid of an entire class of
nuclear weapons.
   ``This will be our last such meeting, and I must admit that I
would not have predicted after first taking office, that some day I
would be waxing nostalgic about my meetings with Soviet leaders,''
Reagan said, in a reference to his days as an ardent anti-communist.
``But here we are, for the fifth time, Mr. Gorbachev and I together,
in the hope of furthering peace.''
   Reagan pointed out that despite their agreement on arms control,
there is much work to be done over differences on that subject, and
on human rights, regional problems, and in bilateral relations.
   The goal of improved U.S.-Sviet relations ``must continue byond
any single presidency or term of office,'' Reagan said, adding that
he is ``particularly delighted'' that President-elect George Bush
will join the meeting.
   ``No one is better versed in the details of Soviet-American
relations or has a stronger foreign policy portfolio than our vice
president,'' Reagan said.
   ``So, on our get-together next week ... you can be sure I'll be
telling Mr. Gorbachev that George Bush represents change, yes, but
also continuity,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan's national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, says
U.S. officials expect no surprises at the luncheon meeting next
week, and that if Gorbachev presents some totally unexpected
proposal, as the Soviet leader did in Iceland two years ago, U.S.
officials will not allow themselves to be forced to make a snap
reply.
   The Reykjavik summit collapsed when Reagan and Gorbachev
disagreed over the Soviet leader's demand that the U.S. president
substantially downgrade his Star Wars missile-defense program.
   U.S. officials were widely criticized after the October 1986
summit, with political opponents accusing the American side of
having been unprepared to cope with Gorbachev's bold proposal.
   ``Based on what we have heard from the Soviets, I am not aware of
any that they're planning to put down on the table,'' Powell said.
   ``But I don't have, obviously, complete control over what the
general secretary might suggest,'' Powell continued. ``And if he
does have some ideas that we have not heard before, we will listen
carefully, respond or take them under advisement as the case may
be.''
   Powell also said that U.S. officials have ``no major new
proposals to put down on the table'' on Governors Island in New York
Harbor next Wednesday.

   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on
Saturday ordered about 1,000 political prisoners released and
commuted all death sentences in her first official act after
assuming power.
   She also promised to free all women prisoners except those
convicted of murder.
   Ms. Bhutto, sworn in Friday, told a news conference her Pakistan
People's Party amnesty program will be handed over to President
Ghulam Ishaq Khan for approval.
   Her new law minister, Etiaz Ahssan, refused to say where Ishaq
Khan stood on the amnesty but said the president had to act on the
advice of the prime minister.
   In her first nationally televised address, Ms. Bhutto on Friday
promised sweeping reforms, including lifting bans on student and
trade unions and launching a new education program to help fight the
nation's 75 percent illiteracy rate.
   All prisoners over 60 years old are to be released providing they
have served five years of their sentence, Ahssan said.
   He said all prisoners except military officers convicted of
non-criminal offenses by military courts under late President
Mohammed Zia ul-Haq are to be freed. The military will review its
own cases, said Ahssan.
   In addition, all sentences are to be reduced by three months, he
said.
   The prime minister offered freedom to ``all persons convicted and
sentenced by a military court for offenses not involving drugs,
smuggling, corruption, embezzlement, bank fraud, robbery, dacoity,
murder and rape.''
   Ms. Bhutto tempered far-reaching economic promises with a warning
that Pakistan's financial books were deep in red ink.
   ``We are anxious to have foreign investment in our country to
have economic growth,'' she said. ``But ultimately it's the Pakistan
labor we are looking toward'' to help rebuild the economy.
   She said the economy left by Gen. Zia's military and civilian
governments has ``left the country close to bankruptcy.''
   However, Ms. Bhutto gave few details.
   Zia died in a mysterious plane crash Aug. 17, weeks after
announcing the Nov. 16 general elections that swept Ms. Bhutto's
party to power. Authorities suspect sabotage in the crash, and a
probe is continuing.
   Ms. Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was overthrown by Zia
in a bloodless coup in 1977 and executed in 1979 after his
conviction for killing a political rival. The Bhutto family has
denied the charge.
   ``I think he would be proud of me,'' Ms. Bhutto said of her
father. ``He was a pragmatist. I'm his daughter but he brought us up
to be our own person.''
   This month Ms. Bhutto will meet leaders of countries of the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. On Thursday, India
expelled two Pakistan diplomats, charging them with spying, and
Pakistan reciprocated with the expulsion of two Indian diplomats the
following day.
   Ms. Bhutto said she's optimistic that the Dec. 29-31 regional
summit can be used to ``defuse the tensions between our countries.''
   The party's stand on the 10-year war in neighboring Afghanistan,
which has resulted in more than 3 million refugees in Pakistan,
won't change, said Ms. Bhutto.
   Pakistan and the United States are staunch backer of Moslem
rebels fighting Kabul's Soviet-backed government.
   ``We look forward to a successful conclusion of the Soviet
withdrawal by next February and the induction of a government
representative of the national aspirations of the people of
Afghanistan,'' she said.
   The Soviets agreed under a U.N.-mediated accord to withdraw all
of its more than 100,000 combat troops by next Feb. 15.
   In her Friday speech, Ms. Bhutto also dissolved the National
Press Trust, which was established in 1960s to control 11
publications, many of them influential. The chairman of the board
was appointed by the president.

<HEAD>Cambodia Shells Guerrilla Positions, Aid Not Reaching Refugees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodian gunners pounded Khmer Rouge
guerrilla positions in Thailand, and aid officials said Saturday
they have not been able to reach Cambodian refugees who may have
been wounded or killed.
   The shelling was directed at an area inside eastern Thailand's
Trat province, a border area where the guerrillas have herded about
7,000 refugees from the U.N.-aided camp of Ta Luan.
   The communist Khmer Rouge, the largest guerrilla gruop opposing
the Vietnam-backed Cambodian government, apparently plan to use the
refugees to populate areas of Cambodia from which Vietnamese forces
have withdrawn.
   The shelling peaked in mid-November in the most intense
cross-border bombardment since 1985. On Tuesday, an aid official who
visited Ta Luan and the nearby Sok Sann camp said he heard ``one
shell a minute'' crashing into the forested hills.
   Sok Sann camp is controlled by the the Khmer People's National
Liberation Front, one of two non-communist guerrilla groups allied
with the Khmer Rouge. Many of the hundreds of wounded rebels were
taken to Camp 85, a major Khmer Rouge military complex, according to
an aid official who quoted sources at Site 8, the largest of four
Khmer Rouge border camps to which the United Nations has access.
   The shelling has driven about 3,000 of the refugees from the
border back to Ta Luan, but no information was available on how the
shelling affected the refugees.
   At the border, the refugees had pitched platic tents while they
built huts made of bamboo or papaya trees. The Khmer Rouge told the
refugees they must return to the border area after the shelling
ends, acccording to officials of the U.N. Border Relief Operation
and the International Committee of the Red Cross.
   The officials repeatedly have asked Thai authorities for access
to refugees who may have been wounded in the gunfire.
   Shepard Lowman, president of the agency Refugees International,
said Thursday the U.S. government should urge the Thai government to
restrain the Khmer Rouge. The Thai military has so far cooperated
with the guerrillas.
   ``We should encourage the Thais, though, to increasingly press
for greater access to those camps to ensure the people are treated
in a humanitarian way, not carried into Cambodia or forced to serve
the Khmer Rouge against their will,'' Lowman said.
   Relief officials said most of the shelling now appears to have
shifted to the area around Borai, a Khmer Rouge-run camp of 5,500
refugees not far north of Ta Luan.
   Sporadic shelling also continued along the northern
Thai-Cambodian border, where the Khmer Rouge moved 5,000 or more
refugees from another U.N.-assisted camp, O'Trao, located in the
northeastern Sisaket province.
   Officials said the guerrillas moved the refugees to at least four
border locations from which they were planning to move them to
Cambodian territory as Vietnam carries out the withdrawal of an
estimated 120,000 troops.
   The Khmer Rouge slaughtered hundreds of thousands of people when
it ruled Cambodia in 1975-78.
   Officials of the United Nations, which provides humanitarian aid
to the more than 300,000 Cambodian refugees stationed at the Thai
border camps, said they believe the 7,000 Cambodians alleged to have
disappeared were marched into the Cambodian interior transporting
arms to the Khmer Rouge.
   About 70,000 Cambodian refugees live in Khmer Rouge-controlled
camps but their fate is largely unknown; the guerrillas generally
refuse access to outsiders.

   President Reagan said Saturday work toward
improving U.S.-Soviet relations must outlast any single president,
and he will tell Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that George Bush
represents change, ``but also continuity.''
   Reagan, in his weekly radio address delivered from Camp David,
Md., also lauded President-elect Bush as a trusted adviser who's
been ``at my side'' at every stage of the summit process.

   Here is the text of President Reagan's radio
address Saturday.
   My fellow Americans, there's a meeting in New York next week I'm
looking forward to. I'll be getting together next Wednesday on
Governors Island with the leader of the Soviet Union, Chairman
Gorbachev. This will be our last such meeting, and I must admit that
I would not have predicted after first taking office that someday I
would be waxing nostalgic about my meetings with Soviet leaders.
   But here we are, for the fifth time Mr. Gorbachev and I together
in the hope of further peace. And always in my mind I go back to
that first summit held in 1985 at a private villa on the shores of
Lake Geneva. At the first of our fireside talks, I said to Mr.
Gorbachev that ours was a unique meeting between two people who had
the power to start World War III or to begin a new era for humanity.
   The opportunity for such a new era is there, and very real. That
isn't to say, of course, that that era is already upon us. No, too
many fundamental differences on matters such as human rights and
regional tensions remain unsettled between East and West. But it is
to say that there is the hope of an era in which the terrible
nightmares of the post war era, totalitarianism and nuclear terror
may diminish significantly and, please God, some day fade away.
   Throughout the postwar period, this has always been America's
agenda, that the blessings of peace and freedom we know so well in
this country will someday belong to every nation, to every people.
   Toward this end, the United States and its allies have over the
last eight years pursued a course of public candor and military
strength, but also a course of vigorous diplomatic engagement with
the Soviets. And the Soviets have responded. The result has been
progress on a wide series of fronts.
   First and most obvious, we have signed the first treaty in
history reducing nuclear armaments _ indeed wiping out a whole class
of U.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles. So, too, other arms
negotiations are moving forward. In purusing this cause, the Soviets
must abide by past agreements and in this regard the Krasnoyarsk
radar violation remains a significant problem.
   In the area of regional conflicts, we've seen a partial Soviet
withdrawal from Afghanistan, and commitment to full withdrawal by
February. In Angola, U.S. mediation has led to a ceasefire and
prospects for a political settlement and withdrawal of Cuban troops.
   In Cambodia, steps have been taken toward a withdrawal of
Vietnamese troops, and in other regions we have seen movements
toward peace. So, too, in our bilateral relations with the Soviets,
there has been movement toward wider exchanges between our two
peoples that bring American and Soviet citizens in closer contact
and communication.
   Finally, but most important, in the area of human rights we have
also seen progress. Yes, we welcome recent steps like an end to
jamming of western broadcasts heard in the Soviet Union, but we also
are hopeful that talk of Democratic reform and greater freedom or
all the Warsaw Pact countries will become more than just talk.
   We hope, for example, for a day when the Soviet Union will permit
the publication of the works of Solzhenitsyn or the day when the
Berlin Wall will be no more.
   Yes, we want bold words of reform about political and religious
expression to become more than just words. So for all the progress
and all the hope, the journey to this final meeting between Mr.
Gorbachev and me at Governors Island has been a difficult one, and
believe me, the journey toward better Soviet-American relations will
remain a difficult one. Yet, it is a journey that must continue
beyond any single president or term of office.
   And that's why I'm particularly delighted that Vice President
George Bush will be joining Mr. Gorbachev and me at Governors Island
next week.
   Now I've spoken many times about Vice President Bush's foreign
policy credentials and his long experience in this field. At every
stage in the summit process he has been at my side. No one is better
versed in the details of Soviet-American relations or has a stronger
foreign policy portfolio than our vice president.
   So while our get-together next week will not be a working summit
with a formal agenda, you can be sure I'll be telling Mr. Gorbachev
that George Bush represents change, yes, but also continuity; that
he stands for firmness and strength and candor in the cause of
freedom; that he knows intimately the essentials of the
Soviet-American relationship and that the American people do not
want treaties for the sake of treaties, they want agreements that
endure and help prevent war as the world moves relentlessly toward a
new birth of freedom for all humanity.
   Until next week, thanks for listening and God bless you.

   Connecticut's Supreme Court has agreed to
hear an appeal by actor Paul Newman in a lawsuit over his salad
dressing business.
   Westport delicatessen owner Julius Gold is suing the actor and
two others, claiming they reneged on a promise to share with him the
profits from Newman's Own dressing and other food items in exchange
for helping develop the products.
   Newman contends he owes Gold nothing.
   The high court agreed Friday to consider only the issue of
whether an appeal can be heard after a jury fails to return a
verdict in a case.
   A trial on the lawsuit ended in a mistrial June 23. Newman's
attorney then asked a judge to dismiss the case, but was denied and
appealed to a higher court. Gold's attorney contends an appeal
should not be heard because there has been was no verdict.

   An insurance company has purchased the
former ranch home of Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh.
   Connecticut General Life Insurance Co., which held the mortgage
on the 64,000-acre Rancho Rajneesh, paid $4.5 million Friday as the
only bidder at a sheriff's auction.
   Larry Rew, an attorney for the company, said Connecticut General
would put the ranch up for sale.
   The commune collapsed in 1985 after Rajneesh pleaded guilty to
immigration fraud and left the country, and the ranch was put up for
sale, originally for $40 million.
   ``It's one step closer to the end,'' said Wasco County Judge
William L. Hulse. ``We've been thinking this was the end of an era
for a long time, but we've kept adding more chapters.''

   When Dulal Biswas heard a cyclone
was bearing down on his fishing village, he sent his 5-year-old
daughter Shanti to her grandparents' home for safety.
   Many of his friends and fellow boatmen disappeared in the storm
Tuesday night, but Biswas survived and gave thanks that Shanti, too,
was safe.
   A few days later, he headed for the place where Shanti had gone,
two miles further inland. On the way, he stumbled upon a child's
body on the bank of the Pasur River, one of the more than 1,400
people who perished when the cyclone struck Bangladesh and India.
   Drawing closer, he peered in disbelief at the bloated,
decomposing body. Then he screamed, beat his chest and cried,
``Shanti, my little doll, Shanti.''
   Biswas, incoherent with grief, could barely relate his story.
Most of it was told by a volunteer from the Red Crescent Society,
the Islamic equivalent of the Red Cross, who was with the boatman
when he found his daughter's body.
   Ram Chandra, the village elder, said Biswas' wife died a year ago
of cholera and Shanti was his only child.
   Chandra said six people died in Shoron Khola when the cyclone
struck, leveling most of the straw-and-mud houses in the village of
160 people. But he said many people, perhaps dozens, had set out in
their boats to try to escape the cyclone bearing down upon Shoron
Khola, which is barely a mile from the Bay of Bengal.
   ``Those who stayed back and prayed were safe,'' the 55-year-old
Chandra said. ``Those who dared to take a boat are either dead or
missing.''
   ``The cyclone came and a wave 10 feet high crashed over the
river. The wind howled and uprooted many trees and destroyed many
houses,'' the village elder said.
   In Bangladesh, about 1,050 people died in the cyclone, a Relief
Ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Saturday.
   In India's West Bengal state, which abuts Bangladesh, the
official death toll had reached 410 by Saturday.
   The number of people still missing in Bangladesh, their fates
unknown, ranged from 3,000 to 5,000, according to newspapers in
Dhaka, the capital.
   The newspapers estimated between 2.5 million and 5 million people
were left homeless by the cyclone that devastated 30 of the
country's 64 administrative districts.
   The actual number of deaths may never be known. Communication is
poor in much of the region, and bureaucracy slows the reporting of
verifiable deaths in some places.
   In Perojpur, 65 miles northeast of Shoron Khola, local council
member Hamiduz Zaman claimed the cyclone caused greater property
damage than one that killed at least 300,000 people in 1970.
   That cyclone, which struck a year before Bangladesh won its
independence from Pakistan in civil war, confined its fury mostly to
the coastal region, while the latest storm reached more than 125
miles inland.
   ``Our latest cyclone did more damage to the standing crops, the
infrastructures, dwellings and telecomunications than the one in
1970,'' Zaman said. ``In my subdistrict, only 14 lives were lost
(this time) but there was colossal damage to the rice crop and the
mud-and-straw houses. Many of the people are too poor to build new
houses for many months.''
   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad, who toured southwestern
Bangladesh on Thursday and Friday to visit the sites of greatest
devastation, said his government will mobilize its resources to help
the people.
   But the government of this impoverished nation, where the per
capita annual income is $150 a year, will be hard-pressed to meet
the task.
   Floods during the summer monsoon rains put three-fourths of the
country under water, killing 1,500 people and destroying much of the
rice crop.
   Cyclones and monsoon floods strike the low-lying nation with
deadly regularity. Most of Bangladesh is barely above sea level. Its
110 million people live in the third-most densely populated land in
the world, after the city-states of Singapore and Hong Kong.
   Bangladeshis live in an average of 2,000 people per square mile.
If the present birth rate is not checked, the population will
surpass 200 million in the next 35 years.
   Already, according to U.N. Officials in Dhaka, Bangladesh is one
of the world's largest recipients of foreign aid _ $2 billion was
pledged before the summer floods.
   The floods, which started in June and peaked in early September,
brought additional offers of aid, although much of it was not
additional aid but a speeding up of foodstuffs, seed grain and
health care materials already in the pipeline for future
distribution.

   Just when the United States and the United
Nations appeared to be patching up an often thorny relationship, the
world body and its host country were thrown back onto a collision
course by a U.S. decision to ban PLO chief Yasser Arafat.
   In an action seen as a slap in the face to the Reagan
adminstration, the General Assembly voted 154-2 Friday to convene a
special session in Geneva so that Arafat can address a debate on the
Middle East. Only the United States and Israel voted against the
measure.
   In the past, Reagan officials have accused the United Nations of
anti-Western bias, wastefulness and of running a bloated,
inefficient bureaucracy in need of reform. Washington has withheld
hundreds of millions of dollars in dues to express its displeasure.
   The United States frequently was denounced as imperialistic by
developing nations, which dominate the 159-nation General Assembly.
   In recent years, civility, cooperation and equilibrium had been
restored. The United States praised the United Nations and its
peacemaking efforts in Afghanistan and in the Iran-Iraq war, and
noted its potential for peacekeeping in regions such as Southern
Africa, Western Sahara and Southeast Asia.
   When Reagan delivered his final presidential speech to the United
Nations in September, he was well-received.
   Now, some fear the reconciliation is in jeopardy.
   ``Does this spell the end of the United Nations in the United
States and the United States in the United Nations?'' wrote
Undersecretary-General Joseph Verner Reed, the highest ranking U.S.
official at the United Nations who was deeply distressed by the U.S.
denial of a visa to Arafat.
   The move, Reed wrote in a letter to President Reagan, has ``done
incalculable damage to U.S. credibility in the world arena.''
   In denying a visa to Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, the State Department said Arafat was an ``accessory''
to acts of terror by the PLO.
   U.N. officials, U.S. allies, Arab leaders and most of the
international community opposed the move. They said the United
States is obliged, under the 1947 Headquarters Agreement, to grant
visas to all U.N. diplomats and invitees on U.N. business.
   Arab diplomats said the rejection of Arafat's visa application
was an insult to the United Nations.
   ``This is the last hurrah of the Reagan administration and has
eroded U.S. credibility with Arab nations,'' said Clovis Maksoud,
ambassador of the Arab League to the United Nations.
   But he added that ``We do not think it will do lasting damage.
   ``We fully expect the new administration of President-elect
George Bush will be more pragmatic and less ideologically obsessive
than its predecessor. We expect the new administration to take stock
of this unfortunate episode, learn from the international outrage
that it has generated and move constructively.''
   Before the Arafat problem, the United States was involved in
another international uproar this year over its efforts to close the
PLO's U.N. Mission.
   A district court judge in New York ruled the U.S. move was
illegal.
   The episode soured U.S.-U.N. relations. Most Arab nations wanted
to move the General Assembly to Geneva, in protest, and said the
United States was trying to stifle the voice of the Palestinian
people.
   Apart from the PLO problem, the United States has been estranged
from the world body because its total outstanding dues now are more
than $400 milion as a result of the money withheld to protest U.N.
policies.
   In September, the Reagan administration announced it would pay
some back dues and make arrangements to pay the outstanding balance.

   Hundreds of rock-throwing demonstrators
tried to storm the closed Union Carbide pesticide plant Saturday on
the fourth anniversary of the gas leak that killed more than 3,300
people, but police blocked the charge.
   Police said they arrested at least 200 of the protesters.
Organizers of the demonstration said about 500 were arrested.
   Most in the crowd were residents of shantytowns across the road
from the plant. Many said they still suffered from the effects of
the toxic methyl isocyanate that leaked out of a storage tank and
turned into a killer white cloud at about 1 a.m. on Dec. 3, 1984.
   The crowd shouted ``We want justice'' and ``Hang Warren
Anderson,'' the Union Carbide president who resigned after the gas
leak.
   A few demonstrators suffered minor injuries as they scuffled with
police wielding steel-tipped bamboo canes. There were no signs of
injuries to the police.
   Reporters estimated the size of the crowd at 1,000 and the number
of uniformed police at 500. Dozens of plainclothes policemen also
were seen moving among the demonstrators.
   Five activists from the Communist Party of India, chief organizer
of the demonstration, scaled the 8-foot walls surrounding the
pesticide plant, which closed after the gas leak and never re-opened.
   Plainclothes police behind the wall grabbed four of the men, but
the fifth ran to a watchtower and hoisted the red flag of the
Communist Party. Both the man and the banner were quickly pulled
down.
   Police sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
demonstrators would be released soon without charge. Indian law
permits police to hold detainees up to 90 days without charge.
Demonstrators usually are held for a few hours or overnight before
being freed.
   The government of India filed a $3 billion damage suit against
the Danbury, Conn.-based company in 1986, but the case is still tied
up in Indian courts. Last year, on the third anniversary of the gas
leak, the government filed murder charges against Anderson and other
Union Carbide officials in India and abroad.
   None of the officials has responded to the summonses, and
government prosecutors have said they will try to extradite Anderson.
   India has accused Union Carbide, whose Indian subsidiary operated
the plant, of negligence resulting in the gas leak.
   The company says the leak was the result of sabotage by a
disgruntled employee.
   At least two dozen effigies representing Anderson and Union
Carbide were set ablaze near the derelict plant Friday and Saturday.
   According to the Madhya Pradesh government, 3,329 people have
died from the gas and 20,000 survivors still suffer from its effects.
   Gas Relief Commissioner S. Sathyam, a state official whose
department records gas deaths and administers relief, said the
victims are still dying at a rate of about one a day.

   Peace talks between Angola and South
Africa were suspended today after negotiations bogged down over how
to verify the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola, South
African officials said.
   The talks were the latest round in U.S.-mediated efforts to end
hostilities between South Africa and Angola and to achieve
independence for South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.
   The spokesman for the South African negotiators, Roland Darroll,
said the South African, Angolan and Cuban delegations needed to
consult with their governments ``on essential questions which have
not been resolved.''
   The negotiators had hoped to sign an interim treaty Saturday
evening or Sunday. A formal treaty was to follow at a ceremony in
New York.
   In Johannesburg, the South African Press Association and
government-run television also reported the South African delegation
was returning home.
   The news agency quoted Foreign Minister Pik Botha of South Africa
as saying he was confident an agreement could be signed sometime
this month, but his delegation had to consult with President P.W.
Botha about proposals made on the issue of verification of Cuban
troop withdrawal from Angola.
   The television report, as well as an earlier report on
goverment-run radio, said Pik Botha would hold talks tonight with a
high-ranking Soviet foreign affairs official to work out snags in
the agreement.
   There was no report about whether those talks had taken place,
but South African television said the Soviet official, Deputy
Foreign Minister Anatoli Adamishin, was staying in the same hotel
where the talks were taking place.
   Such talks would be the first in decades between such
high-ranking officials from the two countries in a
publicly-acknowledged setting.
   South Africa and the Soviet Union have not met formally since
1956, when the Soviets broke diplomatic ties over South Africa's
system of apartheid.
   There have been frequent reports in the last two years of
lower-level contacts between the two nations to end longtime
conflicts in southern Africa. The Soviets, though not a party to the
peace talks, have usually had a delegation on hand to give advice to
their allies, Cuba and Angola.
   Botha briefly left the Brazzaville talks today to cross the Congo
River and deliver a message to Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko.
   Before departing, he told reporters the results of the talks will
depend on the attitude of the Cubans and Angolans. An Angolan
official, who declined to be further identified, said his delegation
still hoped ``for a happy ending.''
   The talks are aimed at achieving withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban
troops who are supporting the Marxist Angolan government in its
civil war against U.S.- and South African-backed guerrillas of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or UNITA. A
Cuban withdrawal is expected to lead to South African withdrawal
from South-West Africa, Angola's southern neighbor.
   South African officials say agreement has been blocked by a
disagreement over verification of the Cuban withdrawal.
   Pretoria has been insisting that it be allowed to participate in
monitoring the pullout, but Angola and Cuba have refused, saying the
United States can monitor the withdrawal and report to South Africa.
   Government-controlled South African radio said American
negotiator Chester Crocker, assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, was pressing South Africa to accept U.S. monitoring of the
withdrawal.

<HEAD>Atlantis Astronauts Continue Top-Secret Mission</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   NASA disclosed nothing but the lunch
menu Saturday as astronauts aboard space shuttle Atlantis reportedly
deployed a top-secret spy satellite that can peer down at the
Soviets through clouds and darkness.
   The public space-to-ground radio link was kept silent while the
five military men went about their business on the second day of the
mission, which began with Friday's launch and is under the control
of the Air Force.
   NASA said in advance it would break the silence only if major
problems developed aboard the spacecraft.
   By all accounts, Saturday was to have been the crew's busiest
day, with the expected release of the $500 million Lacrosse
satellite, but the only official word on the mission came from NASA,
which released the menu: salmon, ham, macaroni and cheese and turkey
tetrazzini.
   Sources have said the satellite is capable of recording sharp
images of military targets in the East Bloc. Weighing 18 tons and
with a solar panel wingspan of 150 feet, the satellite, according to
sources, will help verify Soviet compliance with arms treaties and
serve as a ``radar eye'' for the stealth bomber.
   The Soviet news agency Tass' apparently knows plenty about the
satellite, reporting many details about it, including the code name
Lacrosse.
   Atlantis' secret mission began with a spectacular public blastoff
from Cape Canaveral, Fla., during a momentary calm in fierce,
upper-level winds similar to those that halted the launch on
Thursday.
   Four hours after the shuttle blazed across the clear sky on a
northward course, Mission Control broke the silence, saying: ``The
crew of Atlantis is go for orbit operations.''
   That announcement meant that the spaceship's cargo bay doors were
open and the task of preparing the satellite for deployment could
begin.
   Only military men are aboard Atlantis, serving under Navy Cmdr.
Robert L. Gibson, the commander. The pilot is Air Force Lt. Col. Guy
S. Gardner, and the mission specialists are Col. Richard M. Mullane
and Lt. Col. Jerry L. Ross of the Air Force and Navy Cmdr. William
M. Shepherd.
   According to pre-flight reports, Mullane was to be inside the
shuttle cabin using the orbiter's robot arm to hoist the satellite
out of the cargo bay and release it when Atlantis was in a precise
location and position.
   The procedure was so intricate that Shepherd and Ross were to be
in space-walking suits, prepared to go into the cargo bay if any
problems arose in releasing the satellite. Normally, astronauts do
not suit up for satellite launches.
   Once Lacrosse is in orbit 240 miles high, Gibson and Gardner then
were to fly alongside the satellite until ground controllers were
certain it was working properly.
   The satellite's course reportedly will often take it over the
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, where it can observe military
operations through darkness and cloud cover.
   The crew also planned to conduct several experiments aimed at
defining the role of military observers in space, with reconnaisance
a high priority, according to sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   It is believed the astronauts will test a special optical device
resembling hand-held binoculars.
   The tests will be coordinated with undisclosed ground exercises
that could include troop maneuvers, naval movements or ballistic
missile launches.
   The flight, the second since the Challenger disaster, the 27th
shuttle mission overall and the third dedicated to the military, is
expected to end Monday or Tuesday with the landing at Edwards Air
Force Base in California.
   NASA and the Air Force plan to give 24-hour notice of the landing.

   A financier plans to donate $40 million to the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center for research, a
newspaper reported Saturday.
   The gift would be one of the biggest ever made to a U.S.
university or medical center.
   Harold Clark Simmons, who committed $10 million over 10 years to
the school in 1984 to establish an arthritis research center, will
announce the gift Monday, The Dallas Morning News quoted sources as
saying.
   Simmons, 57, is a former federal bank examiner who parlayed a
$5,000 investment in a drugstore into a corporate empire and
personal fortune worth an estimated $1.5 billion.
   Southwestern issued a statement Friday announcing a news
conference Monday on ``the largest individual gift ever made in
Texas higher education.''
   The gift is ``expected to have significant economic impact'' and
``will target specific research areas, including cancer,'' said the
statement. The school would not identify the donor or the amount.
Southwestern's annual budget is $200 million.
   Simmons, president of Contran Corp., a Dallas holding company,
did not immediately return a telephone call Saturday.
   ``Harold does not believe in inherited wealth,'' an associate who
asked not to be identified told The New York Times. ``His dream is
to have a foundation as large or larger than the Howard Hughes
Medical Institute.'' The Hughes institute is the nation's largest
medical foundation with an endowment of $5 billion.
   David Packard, cofounder of the Hewlett-Packard electronics
company, gave $60 million two years ago for a children's hospital at
the Stanford University Medical Center. His partner, William
Hewlett, gave $70 million to Stanford for various purposes at about
the same time. New York City developer Harry Helmsley gave $50
million this year to New York Hospital and Cornell Medical School.

   The government announced Saturday it will
impose fees for medical services for the first time in more than 50
years.
   The army daily Al-Qaddissiya said the new fees, approved by the
Health Ministry, took effect Thursday. They will cover all kinds of
services ranging from basic examinations to surgery at state
hospitals.
   The fee for a basic examination will be the equivalent of 60
cents, an X-ray about $1.60 and a baby delivery $3.20.
   Public medical service in Iraq has been free since it was started
in 1923.
   The new system is part of an effort by Baghdad to recoup heavy
economic losses stemming from its 8-year conflict with Iran. The
government borrowed up to $80 billion to fund the war. A cease-fire
began Aug. 20.
   The new medical fees also were seen as an attempt to cut down on
the number of people visiting doctors who are not truly sick.

Diary Theft</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Authorities declared former ruler Luis
Garcia Meza a fugitive Saturday after he missed a congressional
hearing to testify on the theft of revolutionary Ernesto ``Che''
Guevara's diary.
   Garcia Meza, who has been under house arrest while facing trial
for theft and other charges, was to appear before the congressional
Justice and Police Commission in Sucre, 325 miles southeast of the
capital.
   The panel has accused Garcia Meza, a former army major general,
of stealing the diary of Guevara from a military safe and selling it
overseas. The diary covered Guevara's guerrilla activities up to his
death in 1967 in the hands of Bolivian military.
   The commission ordered his arrest when he failed to show up to a
Friday hearing. At a second hearing on Saturday his lawyer, Daniel
Salamanca, said in a statement that Garcia Meza refused to attend
and that the commission had no right to order his arrest.
   Col. Juan Ugarte, police commander in Sucre, told a local radio
station Saturday that his agents are searching for Garcia Meza and
have declared him a fugitive.
   Garcia Meza took over the government in 1980 after a bloody
military coup and ruled Bolivia until 1981 when military officers
removed him from office.
   The Supreme Court ordered his house arrest while trying him on
charges of human rights violations and theft between 1980 and 1981.
   Garcia Meza's administration was also accused by the United
States and other governments of involvement in cocaine trafficking.
   Guevara's diary was offered for sale by Sotheby's auction house
in England three years ago but the sale was suspended after the
Bolivian government filed legal briefs saying the diaries were the
property of the Bolivian government.
   Guevara, a Communist doctor from Argentina, helped lead the Cuban
revolution in 1959 and supported leftist guerrilla movements
worldwide. He later broke with Cuban President Fidel Castro and was
among rural revolutionaries hoping to overthrow Bolivia's government
when he was killed.

   A Polish freight train slammed into an East German
train carrying railroad workers Saturday, killing eight and
seriously injuring three, the state-run ADN news agency reported.
   The news agency said the engineer of the Polish train apparently
missed a signal to halt and rammed the East German train, which was
carrying railroad workers. The crash occurred in the town of
Goerlitz on the Polish border.
   Both diesel locomotives burst into flames after the crash and six
cars being pulled by the Polish train derailed, ADN said.
   ADN said the Polish engineer was killed, along with two other
Polish workers on the train. Another Pole was seriously injured.
Five people on the East German train were also killed, and two
seriously injured, ADN said.
   The injured were transported to hospitals in Goerlitz, ADN said.
   Another Polish worker on the train was treated for minor injuries
and released, ADN said. Goerlitz is 120 miles southeast of Berlin.

   Israeli troops fatally shot a Palestinian
teen-ager and wounded at least 15 others Saturday in clashes in the
occupied territories that prompted curfews in three West Bank towns.
   The army also barred reporters from Nablus, the West Bank's
largest city, in response to the unrest.
   The 16-year-old Palestinian was killed in the village of Beit
Furid, about four miles east of Nablus, when troops opened fire on
demonstrators who erected stone barricades and hurled rocks and
bottles at soldiers, the army said.
   The boy, whose name was not immediately released, died of bullet
wounds to the neck and chest at Ittihad Hospital in Nablus, Arab
hospital officials said.
   His death raised to at least 318 the number of Arabs killed since
the start of the nearly yearlong Palestinian uprising against
Israel's military rule of the occupied territories. Eleven Israelis
also have died.
   Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from
Egypt during the 1967 Middle East War.
   Hospital officials said 20 Palestinians were wounded in the
Saturday clashes in the territories.
   An army spokesman, who cannot be identified by name under
military rules, confirmed the shooting death and said that at least
15 Palestinians were wounded in the territories.
   Among the wounded was a 27-year-old Palestinian shot in the head
with a plastic bullet in Nablus. Officials at Ramallah Hospital said
he was in critical condition.
   In the Gaza Strip, Arab witnesses said troops shot and wounded at
least five youths when nearly 100 demonstrators threw rocks at cars
and soldiers outside a Palestinian school in the Khan Yunis refugee
camp.
   Witnesses said soldiers opened fire with rubber bullets and live
ammunition when stone-throwing youths outside the school refused to
disperse.
   The youngest of the wounded was an 11-year-old boy shot in the
right leg with a plastic bullet, Arab reports said.
   The army spokesman's office confirmed four people wounded in a
confrontation in Khan Yunis but said no details were available.

<HEAD>Commissioner Kills Staff Draft That Sparked Controversy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Social Security Commissioner Dorcas R. Hardy,
faced with an outcry over possible changes in disability rules, said
Saturday she has rejected the draft proposal that sparked the furor.
   She said the draft had ``generated inaccurate information and
caused undue alarm to the American public.''
   She said she remains convinced that the agency's hearings and
appeals process needs reform, but the staff-suggested proposal did
not meet her criteria of making the system ``more equitable,
compassionate and efficient.''
   ``I believe that SSA (the Social Security Administration) can do
better and have, therefore, rejected it,'' she said in a four-page
statement.
   The furor erupted last month when The New York Times reported the
Reagan administration was considering restricting the right of
Social Security applicants to introduce new evidence upon appeal.
   Thirty-five senators, including one Republican, Dave Durenburger
of Minnesota, sent a letter to President-elect George Bush on
Wednesday urging him to repudiate the policy change.
   Hardy, in her statement, said her agency ``is deeply committed to
improving the hearings and appeals process to ensure that claimants
receive fair, timely and accurate decisions when appealing an
unfavorable government decision.'
   She said it was important to ensure that the system is
compassionate, since most appeals involve disability claims. She
said people are also entitled to ``a speedy decision.''
   The agency gets 300,000 requests a year for hearings before its
800 administrative law judges, and it takes an average of nearly two
years to appeal a claim through the administrative process to the
federal courts.
   Hardy said 80 percent of Social Security beneficiaries now are
represented at these hearings by lawyers, and the agency each year
``pays almost $100 million in fees to attorneys out of the past due
benefits of claimants who win benefits on appeal.''
   More than half those who appeal disability denials eventually win
benefits.
   The proposal drafted by the agency's Office of Hearings and
Appeals would have required claimants to submit all evidence at
least seven days in advance of a hearing before an administrative
law judge.
   Social Security officials said the draft had not even reached
Hardy's desk when it became public. It proved an acute embarrassment
for Hardy, often mentioned as a contender for secretary of health
and human services in the Bush administration.
   She said that ``because confidence in our policy-making process
has been questioned, I removed the draft proposal from the routine
process and personally reviewed it.''
   Disability benefit cutoffs were a major source of controversy in
the early years of the Reagan administration, when more than 1
million disability beneficiaries had their cases reviewed and more
than 40 percent were ordered off the rolls. More than half won on
appeal, and Congress and the administration eased up on the reviews.
Hardy was not commissioner then.
   In her statement, Hardy said, ``There is nearly unanimous
agreement that the current hearings and appeals process needs
reform. In addition to our own concerns, a vast amount of criticism
has also come from frustrated claimants, attorneys, the courts and
the Congress.''
   To improve it, she said, ``we need an open and honest exchange of
ideas. We must explore all options and alternatives.''
   She said she has asked her Disability Review Council, chaired by
Dr. John E. Affeldt, to review the hearings and appeals process. She
also invited leaders of Congress and ``all interested parties'' to
work together with her to make the process ``fairer, more equitable
and more responsive to the needs of the American public.''

<HEAD>Hungary To Open Permanent Mission On Monday</HEAD>

   Communist Hungary sends its first
ambassador Monday, clearing the way for opening full diplomatic
relations with staunchly anti-communist South Korea, the Foreign
Ministry said Saturday.
   Ministry spokesman Kim Hang-kyung said Ambassador Sandor Etre
will arrive Monday to head his country's four-member mission. Etre,
47, served as Hungary's envoy to North Korea in 1979-84.
   Hungary became the first communist nation to open such a mission
in South Korea shortly before the 1988 Summer Olympics opened in
Seoul Sept. 17.
   The two countries, in announcing the decision, said they will
continue negotiations to open full diplomatic relations as soon as
possible.
   Following the announcement, South Korea set up its first mission
in Budapest in December last year.
   The decision stirred a diplomatic row between Hungary and South
Korea's archrival, communist North Korea. North Korea strongly
indicated it would sever relations with Hungary if Budapest goes
ahead with the decision.
   On Friday, the Soviet Union became the fifth East European nation
to sign agreements to exchange trade offices with South Korea, after
Hungary, Yugoslavia, Poland and Bulgaria, according to Seoul
officials.
   Under an accord signed in Moscow between South Korean and Soviet
officials, the two countries agreed to set up trade offices in each
other's capital in the first half of 1989, the officials said.

   Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said Saturday
that his Soviet counterpart will travel to Beijing for more
discussions before the officials of the world's two largest
communist nations meet next year.
   Qian set no date or place for what would be a historic encounter
between President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and senior Chinese leader
Deng Xioping. Their nations have been estranged for three decades.
   ``Both sides agree believe it is important to hold such a
meeting,'' Qian told reporters at the conclusion of his three-day
visit to Moscow for meetings with Gorbachev and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   However, ``there are some outstanding issues which necessitate
further discussion,'' Qian said. ``For that reason, I have invited
my counterpart Mr. Shevardnadze to visit China early next year to
continue our discussions.''
   Qian, who left for home Saturday night, called the disagreement
between his country and the Soviet Union over Cambodia ``a hot
potato'' to be resolved before their planned summit.
   China wants the Soviet Union to persuade Vietnam to withdraw its
estimated 120,000 troops from Cambodia, where they have been
fighting Chinese-backed guerrillas for the past decade.
   Vietnam has committed itself to the withdrawal of 50,000 of its
forces by the end of this year and its remaining troops by 1990.
   Gorbachev told Qian on Friday he believed Vietnam is showing ``a
constructive spirit'' toward resolving the dispute, the official
Tass news agency reported.
   Qian said China is ready to negotiate directly with Vietnam over
the Cambodian dispute, but he added that some Vietnamese think
Cambodia ``is a dice to play'' in a game.
   ``We think it is not a dice but a hot potato. We think it is
better to throw out the hot potato.''
   Progress also has emerged on China's two other requirements for
improved relations with Moscow. Ongoing negotiations have settled
disputes over parts of the 2,600-mile border between China and the
Soviet Union. On another issue, half of the Soviet troops in
Afghanistan have been withdrawn.
   The Soviet Union sent troops into Afghanistan in December 1979 to
help the government fight the anti-communist rebels. Under Geneva
accords signed April 14 by Pakistan and Afghanistan, the Soviets are
to withdraw all of their military units by Feb. 15.
   However, the Soviets have threatened to disregard the Feb. 15
deadline if rebel fighting escalates. Tass said Gorbachev discussed
the Afghan issue with Qian Friday but gave no details.
   Qian's visit to Moscow was the first by a high-ranking Chinese
official in 31 years. China and the Soviet Union were allies in the
1950s, but relations soured over the direction of the world
communist movement. The tension peaked in 1969, when the two nations
fought a brief frontier war.
   Qian told reporters Saturday that China would like to normalize
relations ``on the basis of peace and coexistence,'' but without the
close ties that once bound the two nations.
   ``It is necessary not to go back to the period of the 1950s, but
it is also necessary not to return to confrontation,'' he said.
   During his 1-hour-40-minute meeting with Gorbachev and more than
six hours of meetings with Shevardnadze, Qian said the subjects
discussed also included border trade and joint exploration of the
Soviet Far East, as well as ``joint use of the labor force.''

<HEAD>President Says He Will Dissolve Parliament, Call Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEXTER CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sri Lanka's president said Saturday he
will dissolve Parliament Dec. 20, a day after presidential
elections, to give his successor ``the benefit of the views of the
present electorate.''
   President Junius R. Jayewardene also said he would call general
elections six months ahead of schedule, on Feb. 15 instead of the
scheduled balloting next August. He said new legislators would begin
their six-year terms March 9.
   Opposition parties and the powerful Buddhist clergy have urged
Jayewardene to disband Parliament before the presidential elections
in an effort to end the ethnic civil war that has wracked this
Indian Ocean island since 1983. Nearly 10,000 people have died in
the fighting.
   But Jayewardene has resisted their calls, saying he would
dissolve Parliament after his successor is chosen.
   ``I feel that an opportunity should be given to the people to
elect a new Parliament so that the new president should have the
benefit of the views of the present electorate,'' the 82-year-old
leader said in a speech broadcast on state-run radio and television.
   Jayewardene, who is ending a political career that spans 45
years, is prohibited by law from seeking a third six-year term.
   He and his United National Party have been in power since 1977,
extending their terms through a 1982 referendum rather than a
general election.
   A Sinhalese extremist group, the People's Liberation Front, has
called for the nation's estimated 9.3 million eligible voters to
boycott the presidential race, charging Jayewardene's government is
incapable of conducting a fair election.
   The front, a shadowy group known more for its violent acts than
its Marxist ideology, opposes a peace accord aimed at ending the
5-year-old insurgency by Tamil militants fighting for a separate
homeland in the north and east provinces. It also wants an estimated
47,000 Indian peacekeeping troops trying to supervise the accord
withdrawn from the island.
   Sinhalese extremists contend the accord grants too many
concessions to the Tamils, who are mostly Hindu and comprise 18
percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people. The predominantly Buddhist
Sinhalese comprise 75 percent of the population and control the
government and the military.
   The front has vowed to kill anyone who supports the accord and
has been blamed for more than 900 political murders since the pact
was signed in July 1987. Most of the victims have been government
supporters.
   Earlier Saturday, Sri Lankan soldiers hunting for Sinhalese
rebels conducted a house-to-house search in the Colombo suburb of
Panadura after imposing a 22-hour curfew, which expires early Sunday.
   More than 100 suspects were taken into custody, but most were
released, according to a military official, who cannot be identified
under briefing rules. The operation was called after authorities
received information that front members planned to launch a
nationwide strike next week in an effort to destablize the
government.
   In his speech Saturday night, Jayewardene said political unrest
had hampered implementation of many of his government's programs.
   However, he told listeners: ``I value especially whatever I have
been able to do to preserve the rights of my people to elect their
representatives, to point out their mistakes and to replace them
through elections, thus preserving the fundamental freedoms of
democracy.''

   President Raul Alfonsin on
Saturday refused to negotiate with hundreds of rebel soliders holed
up at a giant army base and surrounded by loyal troops and tanks.
   Returning from a three-day trip to Mexico and the United States,
Alfonsin immediately met with top military aides and his Cabinet
``and gave instructions to re-establish discipline and order where
it has been broken,'' spokesman Jose Ignacio Lopez said.
   The president ``hopes the problem will be resolved in the course
of the day,'' but ``will not take any attitude that can be
interpreted as negotiation with the rebels,'' Lopez told reporters.
   The majority leader of the House of Deputies, Cesar Jaroslavsky,
who attended the meeting, told reporters later that Chief of Staff
Gen. Jose Dante Caridi asked Alfonsin whether his instructions meant
``that I must fight.''
   ``The president answered: `Do what you must do,''' Jaroslavsky
said.
   Caridi summoned army commanders to Buenos Aires for a meeting.
   Political, labor and civic leaders throughout the country urged
the government to use a firm hand in ending the two-day rebellion,
the third faced by Alfonsin since his election in 1983 to replace a
nearly eight-year military government.
   ``All the weight of the law must be brought to bear against those
who rise up with the arms the people gave them to defend the
constitution,'' said Eduardo Angeloz, the presidential candidate for
Alfonsin's ruling Civic Radical Union Party in elections set for
next May.
   At the giant Campo de Mayo base on the outskirts of Buenos Aires,
an estimated 450 rebels, armed with machine guns and automatic
weapons and led by Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin, 54, remained in
control of an infantry school.
   Loyal troops, who fired several volleys of mortar shells at the
rebels on Friday, surrounded the school, supported by at least 16
medium tanks and armored personnel carriers.
   Although the army provided no figures on the number of troops
present, witnesses said loyal troops surrounding the infantry school
and in the base area appeared to number between 3,000 and 4,000.
   The army said in a communique that four military men were wounded
in exchanges of fire Friday, including a first lieutenant who was
listed in critical condition, a captain and two noncommissioned
officers. The army did not say to which band they belonged.
   Earlier, news agencies had reported that the first lieutenant was
killed.
   Local press reports indicated Friday night that a 19-year-old
woman walking on the base was wounded by gunfire.
   Vice President Victor Martinez announced Friday night that the
uprising ``had been overcome,'' but spokesmen for the rebels quickly
disputed that claim early Saturday.
   Roman Catholic Priest Luis Jardin, who claimed to be a ``personal
friend'' of Seineldin, left the infantry school early Saturday and
was quoted by the private news agency Noticias Argentinas as saying
that ``a truce of several days'' had been agreed on by the rebels
and Caridi.
   ``Seineldin has not surrendered nor does he intend to,'' said
Jardin.
   Seineldin, a combat veteran of the 1982 Falkland Islands War with
Britain, told reporters Friday he and his men did not want to
overturn the government, but sought to ``restore military honor to
the army and review the trials that punish the just and promote the
guilty.''
   A radio station in the northern province of Corrientes claimed to
have obtained a proclamation from rebel supporters which spelled out
demands.
   The rebels, Radio Provincia de Corrientes said, seek replacement
of the current general staff and an immediate end to trials of
military men accused of human rights abuses in a 1970s war against
leftist subversives. At least 9,000 Argentines ``disappeared''
during that time and are presumed dead.
   The station also said the rebels sought special budget treatment
for the armed forces. Army spending has been drastically slashed by
a government plagued by deficit spending, triple-digit annual
inflation and a $56 billion foreign debt.

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government strongly criticized
Australia on Saturday for closing the Yugoslav Consulate in Sydney
and expelling its staff, the state news agency said. But Yugoslavia
did not threaten to retaliate.
   Assistant Foreign Secretary Drago Mirosic made the protest to
Australian Charge d'Affaires Peter Shannon, who was summoned to the
Foreign Secretariat.
   The Foreign Secretariat ``most energetically protested'' the
Australian decision and ``expressed surprise and embitterment'' over
what was described as Australia's ``unilateral and unfounded
decision,'' the Tanjug news agency said.
   Australia on Friday shut the Yugoslav Consulate and ordered the
staff of 12 expelled following a diplomatic row over Yugoslavia's
refusal to surrender a security guard accused of shooting a
demonstrator.
   The Australian government had given the consulate 24 hours to
turn over the guard. When the deadline passed Friday, its foreign
minister, Gareth Evans, gave the staff and their dependents 72 hours
to leave the country.
   Evans said his government reserved the right to claim
compensation from Yugoslav officials for the family of Jospeh Tokic,
16, who was shot in the throat during a protest outside the
consulate Sunday, Yugoslav National Day.
   Yugoslav authorities said the guard, identified as Matijas Zoran,
fired in self-defense when several Croatian youths began scaling the
consulate walls. Croatians are among several ethnic groups in
Yugoslavia.
   About 200,000 Yugoslavs live in Australia.
   Tanjug quoted the Yugoslav protest as saying:
   ``The decision of the Australian authorities represents an act
which is inadequate to the character and level of the entire
relations between Yugoslavia and Australia and inflicts harm to the
preservation and further development of the relations between the
two countries.''
   It expressed ``regret that the proposal of the Federal Secretary
was not accepted (for Australia) to abandon ultimatum demands ...
(and) make possible through direct talks ... that a mutually
acceptable solution be found.''
   Yugoslavia also noted that no information had been received about
measures Australian authorities took to prevent further activity of
``pro-fascist emigres in Australia, directed against Yugoslavia and
its official representatives, as well as against the development of
stable relations between the two countries,'' Tanjug said.
   Yugoslavia emphasized that the responsibility for the current
situation in the two countries' relations rests with Australia.
   It said it ``reserves the right to take appropriate measures to
protect Yugoslav interests and dignity,'' but did not threaten to
retaliate against Australia for closing the consulate.

   European Economic Community leaders vowed
Saturday to forge ahead with plans for a single-market EEC by 1992
and reassured the United States and Japan they will remain faithful
to free trade.
   At the end of a two-day summit on this Greek island, the 12
leaders said in a statement that a unified European market will
benefit ``community and non-community countries alike.''
   But they acknowledged that proposed changes _ including uniform
value-added taxes, opposed by British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher _ resulted in disputes that were causing their
single-market plan to lose momentum.
   Mrs. Thatcher told reporters it was ``absolutely absurd'' to
install such taxes after 1992, since the varying tax rates in the
EEC will automatically steer consumers to the best bargains.
   ``I think the market will deal with any changes that need to be
made,'' she told reporters.
   French President Francois Mitterrand said France stood firm on
the need to harmonize taxes in the years ahead.
   However, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said the 12 EEC
states agreed their 1992 single market project was ``irreversible.''
   The EEC summit sought to allay U.S. and Japanese fears that after
1992 their exports will be shut out of the lucrative market of 322
million West Europeans.
   In their statement, the EEC leaders said:
   ``The internal market will not close in on itself ... (It) will
be a decisive factor contributig to greater liberalization of
international trade.''
   The United States and Japan annually export goods to the EEC
respectively worth about $66 billion and $42 billion to the EEC, or
more than 25 percent of the community's imports.
   In their final statement, the EEC leaders said abolishing
internal EEC borders for travelers must go hand-in-hand with closer
cooperation among police forces to combat terrorism, international
crime and drug smuggling.
   Mrs. Thatcher has expressed fears that a frontier-free Europe
will attract terrorists and international criminals, including
members of the Irish Republican Army, which has units operating in
continental Europe.
   The EEC leaders also reaffirmed their guarded support for a Nov.
15 declaration of an independent Palestinian state by the Palestine
National Council, the PLO's parliament in exile. The council, which
met in Algeria, also endorsed a U.N. resolution that implicitly
recognizes Israel's right to exist.
   On Nov. 21, the EEC welcomed the declaration, but stopped short
of recognizing an independent Palestine.
   The EEC leaders agreed to send their U.N. ambassadors to Geneva
for a planned U.N. General Assembly session to be addressed by
Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat, French
Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said.
   The New York-based assembly is to meet in Geneva because the
United States has refused to issue Arafat a visa to enter the United
States.
   Greece, France, Italy and Spain wanted to send the EEC foreign
ministers to Geneva, but Britain, the Netherlands and West Germany
blocked the move. As a result, 11 EEC leaders agreed to send their
U.N. ambassadors to the Geneva session. Greece, however, will send
Foreign Minister Carolos Papoulias.
   The 12 EEC nations are: Britain, France, West Germany, Italy,
Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece, Ireland,
Portugal and Spain.

   President Reagan will meet Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev for the fifth time on Wednesday, closing out a
relationship that has evolved from open hostility to the old-shoe
clubbiness of rivals drawn by shared personalities.
   Reagan, who spurned superpower summitry throughout his first
term, is likely to accord his Soviet guest in New York the sort of
personal adieu extended to Britain's Margaret Thatcher, a remarkable
finale to a rollercoaster tete-a-tete that survived the icy gusts of
Geneva and Reykjavik to transform national policies and nuclear
arsenals in just three years.
   Some would argue nothing has been transformed more than the
attitude of the president, the longtime cold warrior who made
rebuilding the U.S. military his first priority. Others say the
U.S.-Soviet breakthroughs are more naturally the consequence of
Gorbachev's dynamic emergence from a confusing period of leadership
changes and stagnation at the Kremlin.
   ``I must admit, that I would not have predicted after first
taking office, that some day I would be waxing nostalgic about my
meetings with Soviet leaders,'' Reagan said Saturday in his weekly
radio address. ``But here we are, for the fifth time, Mr. Gorbachev
and I together, in the hope of furthering peace.''
   Wherever the credit lies, the Reagan-Gorbachev relationship has
moved from unbridled suspicion, to grudging respect, to that
Gentleman's Club of Two, where, according to Reagan, ``there is
never a sense of personal animus when the arguments are over.'' And
now, at a luncheon at Governors Island, N.Y., Reagan will present
George Bush as his membership heir in that most elite club.
   In his radio speech, Reagan made a point of pushing Bush toward
center stage.
   ``No one is better versed in the details of Soviet-American
relations or has a stronger foreign policy portfolio than our vice
president,'' Reagan said.
   The president said he will tell Gorbachev that Bush ``stands for
firmness of strength and candor in the cause of freedom,'' and that
the ``American people do not want treateies for the sake of
treaties, they want agreements that endure and prevent war.''
   ``So, on our get-together next week ... you can be sure I'll be
telling Mr. Gorbachev that George Bush represents change, yes, but
also continuity,'' the president said.
   While the administration has gone out of its way to discourage
the notion that the meeting amounts to another summit, Secretary of
State George P. Shultz has said ``there will be lots of substantive
discussion,'' adding that U.S. officials would welcome ``forthcoming
statements'' by Gorbachev on troop imbalances in Europe and the
Berlin Wall.
   Since their initial face-off in Geneva in November 1985, Reagan,
77, and Gorbachev, 56, have held three summits, including the
memorable meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland, when the two leaders
actually discussed a deal to wipe all nuclear weapons from their
arsenals, only to witness the bitter collapse of their entire agenda.
   Spurgeon Keeny, director of the Arms Control Association, a
private group focusing on nuclear arms issues, credits the
flexibility and the personal warmth of both men for the turnaround.
   ``There's been a real change in Reagan's attitude toward the
Soviet Union, and there's no question that Gorbachev is an
unprecedented personality and a major force in Russian history,''
Keeny said. ``It's to Reagan's credit that he recognizes this and
has shown flexibility in his attitude.''
   Keeny said that Reagan stopped talking of the Soviet Union as an
``evil empire'' just as Gorbachev ``certainly seems to have avoided
any negative comments or demeaning statements about Reagan on a
personal basis.''
   But dealings between the two men have, at times, been very testy,
and each has on occasion stood his ground.
   Donald T. Regan, who had a good view as White House chief of
staff at both Geneva and Reykjavik, said after the Geneva summit
that one meeting went awry when Reagan raised the issue of Soviet
adventurism around the world.
   ``There was a very fast (discussion), faster than almost a
pingpong match, with remarks going back and forth from one side to
the other, and Gorbachev demanding answers from the president, the
president sitting back calmly, saying, `I am answering you. If you
will just wait, you'll get your answer,''' Regan said.
   He said Gorbachev repeatedly slapped the table with the palm of
his hand and then pointed his finger at Reagan and asked: ``Who is
threatening whom?'' Regan quoted Reagan as saying later, ``I don't
think in many instances of this kind we erased the other fellow's
belief.''
   There was a similar incident at the close of the Moscow summit
early last June, when Gorbachev tried to get Reagan to accept some
language in the final communique about ``peaceful coexistence,''
which U.S. officials viewed with suspicion.
   Then-White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker told reporters that
``as the meeting ended, all of us stood up, including the president
and the general secretary, and the president and general secretary
continued to pursue their conversation.''
   ``They were going at it pretty heavy and I was proud of the
president,'' Baker said. The United States thought the language was
too vague, and Gorbachev relented.
   Just before the Moscow summit, Reagan told interviewers from
foreign newspapers and television networks that he considered
Gorbachev a friend as well as an adversary.
   ``We can debate and we disagree. But there is never a sense of
personal animus when the arguments are over.''
   While Reagan has challenged Gorbachev to prove that his glasnost
campaign of openness is genuine, he also has said that the West
should encourage the move toward change in the Soviet Union.
   Helmut Sonnenfeldt, an associate fellow at the liberal-oriented
Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank, said ``I think, from
Reagan's standpoint, that this whole glasnost and perestroika
concept came to mean ... that Gorbachev was beginning to see the
light'' about failings in Soviet system.

   A satellite rocket stage being
readied for the next space shuttle launch in February was badly
damaged when a worker bumped into it and will have to be replaced,
NASA announced Saturday.
   NASA spokesman George Diller said officials are assessing ``what
impact if any this incident might have on the planned Feb. 18
launch.''
   The stage is needed to boost a communications satellite to a high
orbit once the astronauts have released it from Discovery's cargo
bay.
   Diller said the worker bumped into the first stage nozzle and
cracked it during pre-launch checks Thursday.
   ``The Air Force and NASA have decided to replace the first stage
with a spare motor already available at the launch site,'' a space
agency statement said.
   Testing was to have begun Dec. 10 on the combined first and
second stages of the two-stage booster, Diller said.
   The tests will be delayed until about Dec. 27, he said, and
technicians probably would have to work two shifts a day seven days
a week to maintain the launch schedule. ``On paper, this plan seems
to work,'' Diller said.

   Romania on Saturday expelled an
American, two West Germans and an Austrian after trying to meet with
Communist Party leader Nicolae Ceausescu's wife, a human rights
group reported.
   The four members of the International Society for Human Rights
were confronted by Romanian secret police at their hotel Saturday
morning and ordered to take an afternoon flight to East Berlin,
according to a statement issued by the Frankfurt-based group.
   Bill Ehart of Atlantic City, N.J.; Katarina Greab of Vienna,
Juerg Scheeser of Hamburg and Edgar Lamm of Bremen all had received
tourist visas and arrived in Bucharest on Friday, the organization
said.
   The group had attempted over the past few months to arrange a
meeting with Elena Ceausescu to present her with a list of more than
2,000 names of Romanians refused permission to join family members
in other countries. They also wanted to discuss a relaxation of
emigration rules, the group's statement said.
   No meeting with Mrs. Ceausescu had been agreed to by Romanian
officials.
   The human rights activists were told by secret police agents that
they had been ordered to leave because ``tourism has nothing to do
with anarchy,'' the society reported.
   It was not immediately clear what steps the group had taken to
meet with Mrs. Ceausescu.
   The four left Romania via Berlin aboard a jet of the East German
Interflug airline.

<HEAD>Mitchell Calls U.N. Move To Geneva `Regrettable'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said
Saturday that the United Nations' decision to move a General
Assembly meeting to Geneva was ``a regrettable action.''
   Mitchell, D-Maine, commented in an interview a day after the U.N.
voted to move the session to permit Yasser Arafat, chairman of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, to speak to the General Assembly.
   The decision came after Secretary of State George P. Shultz
barred Arafat from entering the United States, home of the U.N.,
because of what Shultz said was Arafat's support for terrorism.
   ``I think it's a regrettable action,'' Mitchell said of the U.N.
decision. ``It represents, for the United States, an isolation and
will of course remove the debate from the United States at least for
a period of time.''
   Mitchell said Shultz' decision ``was clear and concise and
well-taken.''
   As for the effort to broker a peace treaty the Mideast, Mitchell
said, ``I don't think it derails the peace process. It's been very
diffuclt of course. There have been a number of obstacles over time,
and we're going to work to continue to do what we can to encourage
direct negotiations between the parties.''
   Earlier, in the Democratic response to President Reagan's weekly
radio address, Mitchell pledged to cooperate with President-elect
George Bush when Bush takes office next month.
   Noting that the White House will be controlled by Republicans
while Democrats run Congress, Mitchell said, ``power will be shared.
Some say this renders our government impotent. That could happen.
But it doesn't have to.''
   ``The larger objective is to provide to our people the greatest
possible individual liberty and economic opportunity. Our system,
divided or not, can do that,'' he said.
   ``It is our joint responsibility _ president and Congress _ to
meet the challenges facing our nation in the way that best serves
all our people,'' he siad. ``Of course, we have differences. And
there will be disagreements. It wouldn't be democracy if we didn't.''

   A construction worker was struck and killed by a
portable toilet blown off the fourth floor of a building by a gust
of wind, police said.
   Ramon Jose Rodriguez, 23, was pronounced dead about an hour after
the accident at a construction site Friday, police said.
   ``High winds evidently blew the toilet over the edge of the
building,'' said police spokeswoman Lucy Fitts. ``The toilet was on
rollers.''
   Jim Lushine, a National Weather Service meteorologist, said wind
gusts could have been about 30 mph at the time. ``Winds are
sometimes 50 percent stronger than at ground level when you get 40
feet up,'' he said.

<HEAD>Soviet Leaders Trip May Divert Attention From Domestic Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sets out this week
on a trip to the United States, Cuba and Britain that will grab
headlines around the world and may distract some attention from his
problems at home.
   The Soviet leader is juggling ethnic violence in the South,
nationalist fever in the Baltic republics to the north and a
pervasive sense that food and other essentials are becoming more
difficult to find despite his promise that perestroika will make
life better.
   The fires he is trying to control are breaking out at least in
part because his new tolerance for dissent permits the fanning of
long-smoldering embers without the harsh police-state crackdowns
that would have been inevitable here only a few years ago.
   At the same time, Gorbachev is moving ahead with the overhaul of
the political system that he insists is needed in order to
institutionalize democracy and block the bureaucracy from sliding
back into stagnation.
   Some Western diplomats have suggested the Soviet president's
travels are aimed at bolstering his image as a world leader at a
time when chronic food shortages and public opposition raise
questions about the success of his administration at home.
   But both Soviet and Western analysts agree the trip is likely to
buttress his efforts to integrate the Soviet Union into the world
community and advance the improvement in East-West relations. That,
they say, is the first step on a long road toward reordering
domestic priorities in order to divert huge sums now allocated to
defense and military aid and direct them toward improving the
quality and availability of goods and services at home.
   ``It's reasonable to think that part of the motivation for the
trip is to polish his image as a leader and effective statesman
abroad,'' said one Western diplomat who studies Soviet affairs but
asked not to be identified. ``The prestige that goes with all of
that may help him play a role and could cause a certain distraction
from domestic problems that seem so difficult to move or resolve.''
   But the Western analyst and a Soviet foreign affairs specialist,
who also spoke on condition of anonymity, agreed that Gorbachev's
trip is consistent with his stated goal of pressing for improved
relations with the West in order to build and new and better life
for his people at home.
   ``The Soviet Union doesn't have the resources to sustain the
investment it's been making in foreign aid and defense,'' the
diplomat said, adding the government ``must apply those resources to
domestic problems'' if Gorbachev's reform program, which he calls
perestroika, or restructuring, is to succeed.
   The source noted that Western intelligence estimates place Soviet
defense spending at 15 percent to 25 percent of the nation's gross
national product, which is at least 2.5 times the comparable ratio
spent by the United States.
   ``Even the lower end of that range would be enormous by world
standards,'' the analyst said. ``The upper end would be truly
staggering.''
   But beyond the numbers, the source added, the military now
monopolizes the nation's scientific and technological resources,
leaving the rest of Soviet society relatively impoverished and
unable to pull itself out of its backwardness.
   The Soviet source, in a separate interview, said Gorbachev's trip
will be aimed largely at dispelling the image many in the West share
of the Soviet Union as an enemy.
   ``We can't afford to finance revolution anymore,'' the source
said. ``Now we must settle these regional conflicts and develop
friendly relations with those who want to see us at the enemy.''
   Gorbachev only recently disclosed his plan to address the United
Nations, say farewell to President Reagan and greet George Bush,
Reagan's successor, and meet with Cuban leader Fidel Castro and
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   But he has been extraordinarily active this fall in pressing for
improved relations, particularly with Western Europe. Since
September, he has received leaders from West Germany, Austria,
Italy, Romania and France, has visited India and on Saturday
discussed with China's foreign minister the need for a
Soviet-Chinese summit within the next six months.
   ``He's very much a realist,'' one source said, ``and as a
realist, he knows he must dispel the `enemy image' and develop a
network of relationships with other countries before he can permit
massive reductions in military spending and a reallocation of
resources.''

<HEAD>Party Leadership Resigns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KARLSRUHE, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 11-member leadership of the
leftist Greens Party resigned Saturday after a no-confidence vote
from members seeking a more moderate course.
   The governing council for the environmentalist party had been
dominated by a radical faction that sees little worth in trying to
influence government actions by working within the West German
parliament.
   Only 44 of the 519 Bundestag seats are held by members of the
Greens Party.
   About 400 Greens delegates gathered during the weekend in
Karlsruhe for a special party conference, during which a
no-confidence vote was proposed. The council and their supporters
had been blamed by other factions within the party for
``irregularities'' in the financing of a new party building in Bonn.
   The no-confidence declaration was approved by a 214 to 186 vote,
after which the council resigned.
   Ousted council member Christian Schmidt said the shakeup may
cause the more radical faction to form their own political party.
   Parliament member and Greens moderate Otto Schily said he viewed
the departure of the far-left leadership as a chance for the
moderates to bring the party closer to the political center.
   The 39,000-member party had been moving farther left during the
past year, a trend that moderates feared could alienate more voters
and jeopardize the Greens' continued participation in the Bundestag.
Only political parties garnering at least 5 percent of the vote in
national elections are allowed to send representatives to the
parliament.
   Greens candidates got 8.3 percent of the vote during the last
federal elections in 1987.
   The party that developed from a radical environmentalist movement
in the 1970s formed a national organization in 1979 and first won
election to the Bundestag in 1983.

<HEAD>Talks End Without Expected Agreement But Peace Process Continues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRAZZAVILLE, Congo (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southern African peace talks ended
without an accord Saturday when Angola, South Africa and Cuba failed
to agree on verification of a Cuban troop withdrawal from Angola.
   The U.S.-mediated talks were expected to produce an interim
accord.
   South African diplomats cited progress, but some members of the
U.S., Cuban and Angolan delegations appeared angry. Those members,
who declined to be further identified, questioned whether the South
Africans had any intention of negotiating an agreement.
   A South African spokesman, Roland Darroll, said the delegations
had to return home for further consultation with their governments
``on essential questions which have not been resolved.''
   The main issue remaining is verification of the withdrawal of
50,000 Cuban troops from Angola, which is scheduled to occur over a
27-month period.
   South African sources say they demanded representation on the
force monitoring the withdrawal, and have declined a U.S. offer to
observe and guarantee the pullout.
   Darroll said the failure to secure an agreement during these
talks should not be considered ``a rupture because progress has been
recorded. ... We will be returning to Brazzaville again with the
other delegations.''
   Although the South Africans sought to minimize the significance
of the failure to reach agreement, as late as Saturday afternoon
their Congolese hosts had been predicting an accord would be signed.
Ten days ago President Denis Sassou-Nguesso's government announced a
treaty would be signed Dec. 1.
   Failure to reach an accord threatens the latest deadline for
beginning the independence process for South-West Africa, also known
as Namibia, which borders South Africa.
   South Africa has said it would like to begin this process, which
will be supervised by the United Nations, by Jan. 1. However,
Pretoria has insisted the Cuban troops be withdrawn from Angola, the
territory's northern neighbor.
   The Cubans have helped Angola's Marxist government rebuff South
African invasions. The government also is battling the anti-Marxist
guerrillas of Jonas Savimbi, backed by South Africa, the United
States and other nations.
   The United States and several African nations have tried to
persuade Angola to negotiate with Savimbi, saying only
reconciliation can bring peace to the former Portuguese colony.
Angola has consistently refused to negotiate with Savimbi, who has
fought from his guerrilla strongholds since losing a struggle for
power following independence from Portugual in 1975.
   In Walvis Bay, South Africa, President P.W. Botha told a
community festival Saturday that the South African port surrounded
by the territory of South-West Africa will never become part of a
future independent Namibia.
   Botha said Walvis Bay is the most important harbor on the
southwest African coast between South Africa's naval headquarters at
Simonstown and the Angolan capital of Luanda. He said anyone
suggesting that it would not remain part of South Africa was talking
``nonsense.''

   A man trying to climb through a window at his
father's home got stuck in a 9-inch opening and suffocated, police
said.
   Police said Rocky Benedetto's body was found Thursday night by
his father, Angelo, at the elder Benedetto's home in this Rochester
suburb. The son's body was stuck at the chest in a ground-floor
bedroom window, his head inside and feet dangling 18 inches above
the ground outside, police said.
   A autopsy report by the Monroe County medical examiner's office
said Benedetto, 31, of Pittsford, died of asphyxia due to
compression to his chest. His death was ruled an accident.
   ``He got stuck in there and by violently trying to get out he did
more damage than help,'' said Police Chief Thomas Roche.
   The elder Benedetto said he didn't know why his son didn't use
his key.

<HEAD>Soviets and Afghan Guerrillas Hold Direct Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Afghan guerrilla alliance held its
first direct talks with Soviet officials since Soviet troops were
sent to back the Marxist Afghan government in 1979.
   The head of the guerrilla delegation said the talks signaled the
failure of a U.N.-mediated accord to end the fighting.
   The talks began in Taif, a Saudi Arabian resort 600 miles from
Riyadh. The informal meeting is to be followed by formal
negotiations beginning later Saturday or Sunday, said sources close
to the talks.
   No details were immediately available about the meeting.
   The U.N.-mediated Geneva accord signed in April by the Soviet
Union and Pakistan called the Soviets' estimated 100,000 troops
backing the Marxist Afghan government to leave by Feb. 15.
   The first half left by August according to plan, but the Soviets
recently halted the pullout to protest continued operations by the
guerrillas, who have captured a number of cities.
   The Saturday meeting began after the arrival of Yuli Vorontsov, a
deputy foreign minister recently named ambassador to Afghanistan.
Vorontsov headed the Soviet delegation.
   Burhanuddin Rabbani, leader of a loose alliance of seven Afghan
resistance groups based in Peshawar, Pakistan, is the head of the
five-member guerrilla delegation.
   Rabbani, in a statement released Saturday in Pakistan, said
Moscow asked for the talks. He said his delegation planned to ask
the Soviets to withdraw the remaining Red Army troops from
Afghanistan immediately.
   ``The direct talks ... will mean the failure of the Geneva
accord,'' Rabbani said. The U.S.- and Pakistan-backed guerrillas
were not a part of the Geneva agreement.
   Rabbani said the delegation will also ask Moscow for ``payment of
war reparations,'' and ``the urgent removal of mines in the area
under Russian occupation.'' In addition the guerrillas want the
Soviets to supply maps of mined areas now under rebel control.
   Members of individual guerrilla groups met with Soviet officials
in Islamabad last month and in Bonn, West Germany, earlier this year
to discuss exchanging prisoners of war. This was the first direct
meeting with the guerrilla alliance.
   Saudi Arabia, a pro-Western kingdom, was chosen as a venue by the
Afghan resistance groups because of the influence it wields in the
Islamic world due to its oil wealth and control over Islam's two
holiest shrines.
   An official Saudi statement issued late Saturday, distributed by
the official Saudi press agency, said that the meeting was arranged
``at the mutual desire'' of the two sides and the aim was ``to
discuss issues pending between the two sides to reach a just
settlement of the Afghan problem.''
   Saudi leaders have tied the establishment of relations with
Moscow to a total pullout of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, a
Moslem state.
   Vladimir Petrovsky, also a Soviet deputy foreign minister, told a
press briefing in Moscow on Friday that the meeting was arranged by
the Saudi government with the cooperation of the Afghan government.
   It is aimed at finding ``ways for an internal Afghan
settlement,'' he said. However, he added that the meeting was not
connected to the international conference on demilitarization.
   Moscow and Afghan President Najib seek to convene an
international conference to demilitarize the country and set up a
coalition government with the guerrillas, who have rejected such a
conference.

<TEXT>
   A briefing Saturday by the advance team for
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev turned into a display of
glasnost when team members disagreed whether the majority of Soviets
oppose Gorbachev's reforms.
   However, the Soviets could offer no clue to Gorbachev's schedule
of activities this week.
   The team's chief spokesman, Nikolai Yefimov, a senior ideologist
of the Communist Party Central Committee, insisted the team had no
more information on Gorbachev's visit, beginning with his arrival
Tuesday, than the reporters they addressed.
   Last week the Soviet U.N. Mission released a tentative schedule
for Gorbachev, but later withdrew it.
   Yefimov and five other officials even refused to speculate on
published reports that Gorbachev would meet billionaire real estate
developer Donald Trump or visit Wall Street while in New York.
   But Mark Zaharov, director of the Moscow Theater, said he would
like to see the Broadway play ``A Chorus Line'' to get some tips on
how to put on a hit musical.
   ``Our critics have been telling us that we too seldom put forward
any blockbusters. I would like to know whether you have a musical on
Broadway that has taken over from `A Chorus Line,''' said Zaharov.
   He said Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, love the theater, but he
doubted their schedule would leave time for them to attend any
Broadway shows.
   The briefing epitomized Gorbachev's program for glasnost, or
openness, when the two officials disagreed on details of Soviet
reforms.
   Zaharov, a writer and director of the Lenin Council of the Moscow
Theater, said Gorbachev's reforms were not supported by a majority
of Soviets.
   ``In my personal feeling, very many people in our country don't
understand the importance of the processes that are going on in Mr.
Gorbachev's initiative,'' Zaharov said. ``I think he has more
opponents than supporters.
   ``I think in our country there is a lot of inertia still
prevailing, lack of initiative, and we are reaping the harvest of
some very difficult times in our history, and in this regard I am
somewhat pessimistic myself,'' he said.
   Yefimov disagreed.
   ``I don't share, I repeat, I don't entirely share the view of my
friend Mark Zaharov when he said that Gorbachev has more opponents
than supporters,'' Yefimov said.
   ``The forces of inertia are very great, and these forces of
inertia and these old habits are part of all of us. Maybe I'm too
optimistic, I don't know, but I can say with an absolutely clear
conscience that this (reform) machine is moving and is on its way,''
he said.

   The nation's cities and towns will bear the burden
of government cutbacks unless the Bush administration raises more
revenue, said officials gathering Saturday for the National League
of Cities convention.
   Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn called the convention ``an
excellent opportunity to set an urban agenda for the nation's
cities.''
   More than 8,000 delegates from 1,300 local governments are
expected to attend the 65th annual convention of the country's
largest municipal organization.
   The convention formally begins Monday, with Massachusetts Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis, the unsuccessful Democratic candidate for
president, as one of the scheduled speakers. Randy Arndt, spokesman
for the league, said Saturday that Bush was invited to attend the
convention but did not accept the invitation.
   League President Pamela P. Plumb, a city councilor and former
mayor of Portland, Maine, said the nation's cities and towns ``will
bear the brunt of deficit reduction programs unless President-elect
Bush deals with revenue collection in a serious way.''
   Plumb said the league hopes to send strong signals to the Bush
administration that relationships betweeen local and federal
government need to be strengthened.
   Issues cited by delegates for discussion at the convention
include affordable housing, economic development, job training,
fighting inner-city drug use and improving education, she said.

<HEAD>Moslem Prime Minister Calls Closing of Beirut Crossing `Sabotage'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Moslem cabinet in
Lebanon's dual government said Saturday that the Christian decision
to close the only crossing linking the divided capital was
``sabotage.''
   The closure of the Museum Crossing was ordered Friday by
Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun to protest harassment by
Syrian-backed milities of soldiers moving from west Beirut to the
east side.
   The move has caused food and fuel shortages in west Beirut.
   ``This is an irresponsible act of sabotage,'' said acting Prime
Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem. Aoun heads the three-member
Christian interim cabinet.
   A military source said Saturday the real reason behind Aoun's
move was the failure of the Central Bank, based in west Beirut, to
pay the November salaries of army personnel stationed in east
Beirut. Officials at the Central Bank declined to comment.
   The closure brought the daily truck supplies of flour and fuel
from Christian east Beirut to the Moslem sector to a standtill,
causing thousands of residents to crowd gas stations and bakeries to
stockpile on the commodities.
   It also was feared that the Christian army command would order a
blockade of drinking water. Water tanks, which supply both sides of
the capital, are based in east Beirut.
   The development aggravates a political crisis that threatens to
formalize the nation's de facto partition into two sectarian states.
   The crisis began when Parliament failed to elect a successor to
former President Amin Gemayel who, minutes before his term expired
on Sept. 22, appointed Aoun to head the interim cabinet.
   Syrian-backed Moslem leaders rejected Aoun's appointment, and
backed Hoss.
   Aoun's appointment, the Moslems charged, violated an unwritten
national covenant dating to Lebanon's independence from France in
1943. Under that pact, the premiership is given to the Sunni Moslem
sect, the presidency to the Maronite Christians and the position of
Parliament speaker to a Shiite Moslem.

   High pressure dominated the weather across the nation Saturday
and the only precipitation was a few snow showers along a cold front
in the upper Midwest.
   Strong northwesterly wind was expected to move the snow showers
to the lower Great Lakes region and parts of the upper Ohio Valley
during the night, with up to 6 inches of snow possible in
northwestern Pennsylvania.
   Ahead of the cold front, strong southwesterly wind blew across
the Ohio Valley and the lower Great Lakes region. Strong
northwesterly wind prevailed from the upper Great Lakes to
northeastern New Mexico.
   A high wind warning was posted in western New York state.
   Wind gusted to 55 mph at Buffalo, N.Y., and blew the cover on a
police department undercover car. The small sedan was parked in
front of police headquarters when the wind caught the driver's side
door and ripped it off its hinges, police said.
   Without a door, the undercover car was pretty conspicuous,
acknowledged Chief of Detectives Angelo Alessandra.
   Dense fog developed in the valleys of the West during the night
but largely burned off during the day.
   Freezing temperatures during the day were primarily confined to
the area from eastern North Dakota to northwestern Upper Michigan.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 10
degrees at Jackson, Wyo., to 78 at Palm Springs, Calif. Saturday
morning's official low was 11 degrees below zero at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Sunday, snow showers were forecast from the upper Ohio Valley
to northern New England. Fog was forecast in some valleys of the
West.
   Highs in the 20s or lower 30s were predicted from northern
Minnesota to northern New England; in the 30s from the eastern
Dakotas to the Great Lakes region and through the northern Ohio
Valley to southern and central New England; above 60 from the
southern and central California coast to southern Arizona, and from
south-central Texas through the central Gulf Coast to the southern
Atlantic Coast; in the 70s in extreme southern California, extreme
southern Arizona, extreme southern Texas and southern and central
Florida; and in the 40s and 50s across most of the rest of the
nation.

   Hedda Nussbaum, a once-pretty woman whose face
and psyche bear the scars of what she describes as domestic torture,
has told of a sorrowful scenario that ended in death for 6-year-old
Lisa Steinberg.
   On Monday, Ms. Nussbaum, a former editor for Random House, will
return for a third day as the key prosecution witness in the trial
of her former companion, disbarred lawyer Joel Steinberg, who is
charged with murdering the illegally adopted child they raised as
their own.
   Her testimony, broadcast live by three local television stations
and recounted nationally, has described an 11-year relationship that
deteriorated with beatings, brainwashing, food deprivation and other
bizarre punishments for imagined transgressions.
   A 1981 photograph shows a smiling, vivacious, brown-haired, Hedda
Nussbaum who bears no resemblance to the woman now testifying:
gray-haired, with a boxer's nose, a cauliflower ear, a deformed
mouth, an injured eye.
   ``I'm hoping something positive will come out of it: more
support, more treatment and more awareness for women and for
children,'' said Janet Segal, director of clinical services at the
Four Winds Hospital in Katonah, where Ms. Nussbaum has received
psychiatric treatment since March.
   ``It's not something that can be treated with a pill or one or
two (therapy) sessions. It takes a lot of concerted effort.''
   In a slow, deliberate voice, punctuated by pain when she talks
about Lisa, Ms. Nussbaum, 46, has told how she came to view
Steinberg as a ``godlike figure'' _ asking his permission to eat,
obeying his orders to sleep on the floor or sit in a tub of cold
water.
   Jurors saw handwritten pages in which Nussbaum vowed to care
about Steinberg's hair, clothes, work, problems, diet, future, teeth
and other concerns. In another paper, she wrote 10 times that
``anger is destructive'' and that ``self-defense is regressive.''
   Steinberg convinced Ms. Nussbaum that she had belonged to a
sado-masochistic cult, then encouraged her to imagine the details
after convincing her she had amnesia, she testified.
   It was in this climate, the prosecution alleges, that an abused
and neglected Lisa was hurt on the night of Nov. 1, 1987. Hours
later, Joel Steinberg, smoking cocaine, admitted knocking the child
down and said it was because she stared at him, Ms. Nussbaum
testified. Lisa died four days later of a brain injury.
   Ms. Nussbaum was arrested with Steinberg after the little girl's
death, but charges against her were dropped and she agreed to
testify against him.
   The prosecution contends that Ms. Nussbaum, who lost her job when
she frequently missed work because of injuries and then spent most
of her time confined to the family's Greenwich Village apartment,
was herself too much of a victim to have helped the child.
   ``I can liken it to being a prisoner of war,'' Ms. Segal said
Saturday.
   The battered spouse syndrome, Ms. Segal said, is ``a process of
brainwashing where you end up not really knowing what you think,
what you believe, what's right, what's wrong. ... Gradually, there's
an erosion of spirit, of will, of judgment.''
   Its victims often are those who ``tend to be a bit timid,
possibly fearful of the unknown,'' she said.
   Testimony showed that Ms. Nussbaum tried to run away six times.
Once, she changed her mind because she feared violent retaliation,
she said. Once, a friend's brother told her she was being disloyal
to Steinberg; once, she went to a Connecticut social services
agency, where a staff member asked Steinberg to come get her.
   ``Generally, what you find is an alliance of sorts: physical or
emotional abuse, which is then, almost like a seesaw, balanced by
some occasional nurturing,'' said Ms. Segal. ``For a great many
women, if they did leave, where would they go _ especially with
children?'' In addition to Lisa, Ms. Nussbaum and Steinberg had
another illegally adopoted child, a boy who has since been returned
to his natural mother.
   Ms. Segal said patient confidentiality precluded her discussing
specifics of Ms. Nussbaum's case.
   ``She's been very courageous and is handling herself beautifully
_ that's my personal opinion,'' said Ms. Segal, adding that she also
had told that to Ms. Nussbaum.
   ``I think that now, people may feel a little safer talking about
some of this. It might encourage women to seek help, to try to get
out of eroding situations in their lives and to know that they're
not alone.''

   Kremlin officials beefed up security at airports
and power plants in the republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia on
Saturday and scrambled to aid 150,000 refugees who have fled their
homes in fear of ethnic violence, Soviet media reported.
   The Moscow leadership also ripped into the Communist Party and
government leaders of the rival republics for failing to halt the
wave of rioting that has killed at least 28 people.
   Soviet leaders ordered local officials in the republics to work
together on a special commission to ease the tension, and assigned
several members of the ruling Politburo to assist them.
   ``Instead of fighting those who instigate disorders, spread all
kinds of rumors, and stir up national hatred, there is only dispute
about who is more guilty,'' the official Tass news agency said
Saturday, in reporting on an emergency meeting called Thursday by
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev with leaders of Azerbaijan,
Armenia and the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   ``The two republics cannot agree on even one action together,''
Tass said.
   Tanks and Soviet soldiers moved into the two southern republics
two weeks ago in attempt to stop the violence, but tensions have not
abated. On Friday, official Baku radio reported that troops halted a
mob of 1,500 that was attempting to attack Armenian residents of the
Azerbaijani capital.
   The Tass report, carried on the national evening news Saturday,
flatly rejected any possibility of altering the borders of the
republics in the currently volatile situation.
   Armenians have been demanding that Nagorno-Karabakh, a largely
Armenian section of Azerbaijan, be turned over to the Armenian
republic.
   Azerbaijanis and Armenians must work out a joint solution in
which ``there should be no winners or losers,'' Tass said. The
report also warned that ``tomorrow might be even more tragic'' if
nothing is done.
   The Council of Ministers ordered a 24-hour guard on ``power
plants, oil and gas fields, pipelines, power lines, and facilities
for rail and air transport, communications and water supplies'' in
both republics, Tass reported. Baku is the center of the Caspian Sea
oilfields.
   Such action was required because ``certain irresponsible elements
are trying to put out of action vitally important industrial and
transport facilities,'' Tass reported. The Council of Ministers also
ordered local authorities to being arresting strike organizers and
anyone else wreaking havoc with the economy.
   Baku remained exceptionally tense, as crowds numbering into the
hundreds of thousands continued to mass on Lenin Square. Soldiers
searched arriving demonstrators for weapons and explosives, said
Baku radio, quoting Col. Gen. Tyagunov, military commandant of the
city.
   The radio reports tried to crush rumors that large numbers of
Azerbaijanis have been slain or injured in the ethnic disputes with
Armenians. In reality, just 17 people had been treated by Baku
medical authorities in the past several days even though 78,000
Azerbaijanis have swarmed back to their native republic from
Armenia, the radio reported.
   The Azerbaijani Council of Ministers confirmed the figure of
78,000 refugees in Azerbaijan. The Armenpress news agency in Armenia
said 70,000 Armenians had fled in the opposite direction.
   The Tass report on Gorbachev's meeting with political leaders and
citizens of the two republics flatly rejected any notion that the
strife is solely due to the dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh. It
admitted serious failures in economic, political and social issues,
but added that the issue has become a cover-up for corruption and a
struggle for power.
   The report did not name which Politburo members would be assigned
to the commission. However, the Politburo members at Thursday's
meeting included Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, Nikolai N.
Slyunkov, Vladimir M. Chebrikov, Alexander N. Yakovlev, and
non-voting members Anatoly I. Lyukyanov and Georgi P. Razumovsky.

   A sharp earthquake deep beneath City Hall
jarred Southern California early Saturday, toppling bottles from
store shelves, knocking out power to thousands of homes and causing
at least 24 minor injuries.
   The 3:38 a.m. quake registered 5 on the Richter scale, said Hall
Daily, a spokesman for the California Institute of Technology
Seismology Laboratory. Several aftershocks were recorded, the
largest measuring 2.6.
   No serious damage was reported.
   The quake was felt at least 90 miles away, in San Diego. The
earth shook across 15,000 square miles and seven counties for about
15 seconds.
   ``Talk about your rude awakenings,'' said Patricia Brillhart, who
was awakened at her home a quarter-mile from the Rose Bowl by her
shaking bed and the sound of her china crashing to the floor. The
Rose Bowl is about two miles from City Hall.
   It was the strongest quake in the Los Angeles area since a 5.9
temblor on Oct. 1, 1987, and an aftershock two days later killed
eight people, injured 200 and caused $358 million in damage.
   The 66-year-old Rose Bowl, home of the annual Tournament of Roses
New Year's Day college football classic, appeared to be undamaged.
   Twenty-four people were treated for minor injuries at four
hospitals. Most suffered cuts and bruises when they trippped and
fell, nursing supervisors said.
   The most serious injury was a man who mistook the quake for an
intruder and shot himself in the leg, said Shirley Muldoon, nursing
supervisor at St. Joseph's Medical Center in Burbank.
   An 18-year-old man apparently panicked and fell through a window,
suffering minor abrasions, said County USC-Medical Center
spokeswoman Norka Manning.
   ``It started out slow, then `Bam!' for seven seconds,'' said
Mitch Cramer, night manager at a grocery store, where the quake
broke jelly jars, and juice and liquor bottles.
   ``The beef jerky fell down. The windows shook and the doors
rattled,'' said Azad Medi, a clerk at a gas station and convenience
store in El Toro.
   Power outages were scattered throughout the area, including
Pasadena, downtown Los Angeles and parts of the San Fernando Valley.
The quake was felt in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Diego, San
Bernardino, Kern and Ventura counties.
   About 100,000 customers of the Los Angeles Department of Water
and Power were without electricity for up to seven minutes, said
spokesman Ed Freudenburg. About 1,000 customers in the Van Nuys area
were without power for about 90 minutes.
   The temblor was at first believed to have been centered about six
miles beneath the Rose Bowl. But additional readings later Saturday
revealed the quake was centered 10 miles beneath the Pasadena City
Hall, about two miles east of original estimates, said Daily at
Caltech.
   The City Hall was damaged in a stronger 1987 quake and now stands
behind scaffolding, but did not appear to be damaged further
although authorities had not yet closely examined it.
   ``A magnitude 5 is just beginning to get into the type of
earthquake that one would expect damage, at least with the
construction practices we have here,'' said Caltech seismologist
Clarence Allen.
   Pasadena officials said the quake broke a few residential gas
lines and tripped numerous tripped burglar and auto alarms. The
quake shattered plate glass windows in some stores.
   Mark Gofstein, a newscaster for a radio station at the University
of California at Los Angeles, said he was at the station on the
Westwood campus when the temblor hit.
   ``A lot of pranksters started calling up the station requesting
the song `Shake, Rattle and Roll,''' Gofstein said.
   Before the 1987 quakes in Whittier, the most destructive recent
quake in metropolitan Los Angeles was the 1971 San Fernando quake,
which measured 6.4 and caused $511 million in damage.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 5 can cause considerable damage in the local
area, 6 severe damage and a 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake,
capable of widespread heavy damage. An 8 is a ``great'' quake,
capable of tremendous damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter
scale.

   Hundreds of firefighters and police from
across the country paid tribute Saturday to six firefighters killed
in an explosion blamed on arsonists.
   ``They were willing and able to take risks in their every day
jobs for our protection, risk most of us would never dream of
taking,'' Mayor Richard Berkley told the mourners.
   ``So we owe these men a great deal. We owe them a commitment to
do everything in our power to prevent things like this from ever
happening again,'' the mayor said.
   Relatives of the six firefighters wiped away tears during parts
of the hour-long ceremony at Arrowhead Stadium. Flower arrangements
covered the stadium's field, where football's Kansas City Chiefs
play.
   The firefighters died Tuesday when about 50,000 pounds of
ammonium nitrate, a blasting agent, exploded at a highway
construction site.
   They had responded to a report that a pickup and construction
trailer were on fire. Witnesses have said they saw people prowling
in the area earlier.
   An estimated 2,500 firefighters and public safety officers and
5,000 private citizens attended the memorial, said fire department
spokesman Harold Knabe.
   Alfred Whitehead, president of the International Association of
Firefighters, spoke to the gathering in a trembling voice.
   ``As firefighters, we see death, destruction, pain and sorrow all
the time,'' said Whitehead. ``We don't usually share it with anyone
else, just ourselves.''
   ``But that doesn't mean we don't laugh, we don't love, we don't
cry, and we don't hurt.''
   Sgt. Troy Cole said police have received 50 to 75 tips, most of
them after Wednesday's announcement of a $35,000 reward. An
anonymous donor contributed $25,000.
   The men who died included two captains, Gerald C. Halloran, 57,
and James H. Kilventon Jr., 54, who between them had 66 years of
experience with the department.
   Funerals were held Friday for the captains and firefighters
Thomas McKarnin, 42, and Thomas M. Fry, 41. The rites for
firefighter Michael R. Oldham, 32, were Saturday, and those for
firefighter Luther E. Hurd, 31, will be Monday.
   On Friday, pumper trucks draped in black carried the first four
firefighters to their graves, with Halloran and Kilventon buried not
far from each other at a cemetery in suburban Raytown.
   ``It's difficult to try to reconcile the infinite love of God
with what's happened here,'' said Bishop John Sullivan of the Roman
Catholic Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph. ``We're called not just
to know God and to love him, but to trust him and put outselves in
his hands.''
   ``These men are very special,'' he said. ``These men labor not
much for monetary compensation but for the love of others.''

<HEAD>Ailing Artist Improving</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BARCELONA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The condition of ailing surrealist
painter Salvador Dali is improving after nearly a week's
hospitalization for severe heart trouble and blood clots in a lung,
his doctors said Saturday.
   In a statement, a five-doctor team said the 84-year-old artist
``continues to improve favorably both from the clinical point of
view and that of the amount of oxygen in his blood.'' But they made
no predictions about his further recovery.
   On Monday, a police-escorted ambulance rushed the artist to the
Quiron Clinic here from a hospital in his hometown of Figueras, 60
miles north of Barcelona. He was listed in critical condition at
Quiron but began improving Thursday.
   He had entered Figueras Hospital on Sunday with pneumonia
stemming from a prolonged cold.
   Dali, a famous for his limp watches draped over dreamlike
landscapes, is the last member of an outstanding generation of
Spanish painters. They included Pablo Picasso, who died in 1973, and
Joan Miro, who died a decade later.
   One of Dali's doctors, Juan Garcia San Miguel, told reporters
that complications in the artist's condition could still arise ``but
now there is less of a possibility.
   ``He gets out of bed each day to sit up in a chair for a good
while,'' the doctor said.
   The statement said doctors will decide Monday whether to move
Dali out of the intensive care unit of the hospital.
   Since August 1984, Dali has been ailing as a result of burns he
suffered during a fire in the bedroom of his castle residence in La
Pera, 40 miles south of Figueras.
   After release from a hospital three months later, Dali moved to a
mansion attached to his Theater-Museum in Figueras.
   His brush with death left him bound to a wheel chair and eating
through a gastro-nasal tube. Since then, a team of nurses has kept
watch over him 24 hours a day.
   In July 1986, Dali underwent surgery in Barcelona to receive a
heart pacemaker.

<HEAD>Simon Says 1992 Presidential Bid Unlikely</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Paul Simon expects to have all his
presidential campaign debts paid off by early January, and he says
he'll probably sit out the 1992 race for the White House.
   Instead, Simon said in a radio interview taped Friday that he is
eager to ``start all over again'' on a campaign to retain his Senate
seat in 1990.
   Simon, D-Ill., said he has no problems with the Rev. Jesse
Jackson and does not expect a backlash from Jackson supporters when
he seeks re-election.
   Simon's presidential bid effectively ended after the Illinois
primary, in which he defeated fellow Illinoisan Jackson, but he kept
a hold on the delegates he won until the Democratic National
Convention.
   Some Jackson backers contend that Simon's refusal to release his
delegates after dropping out of the race undermined Jackson's broker
status at the convention.
   ``I don't think there will be much of a problem in 1990,'' Simon
said, in the radio interview which is to be broadcast Sunday on WBBM
radio. ``My voting record is clear on civil rights, things that are
important to minorities.''
   Jackson ``has earned his spurs'' within the Democratic Party and
should be viewed as one of the party's leaders, Simon said.
   Simon said his unsuccessful presidential bid cost about $11
million and he expects to have all campaign debts paid off by next
month.
   He said it is ``extremely unlikely'' that he would run for
president again in 1992. His immediate task is to start raising the
$6 million he expects to spend in the 1990 Senate race, Simon said.

<TEXT>
   A company that makes a vital material used
in the space shuttle has signed a $17.75 million agreement that
settles lawsuits accusing it of contaminating water and exposing
workers to dangerous chemicals.
   The agreement, reached Friday with state officials, calls for
Avtex Fibers Inc. to comply with water quality laws, make its plant
safer for workers and pay $2 million in civil fines to the town of
Front Royal.
   ``We recognized the importance of the plant, with its 1,300 jobs
and the roles it plays in the space program and the national
security,'' said state Attorney General Mary Sue Terry.
   ``But our primary duty was to safeguard the environment and
protect the workers, of Front Royal, and of the commonwealth. To
accomplish that objective, we had to take a hard line.''
   Avtex spokesman Nick Nichols said Avtex managers were pleased to
put the lawsuits behind them. ``They now intend to go forward with
their business and take care of the various issues in these two
decrees,'' he said in a telephone interview from Washington.
   There was no answer Saturday at Avtex Chairman John N. Gregg's
home.
   The agreement, filed in two consent degrees in circuit courts in
Richmond and Warren County, includes $10 million in civil penalties
if the company fails to comply.
   The agreement settles two lawsuits field by the attorney
general's office. One filed for the Department of Labor and Industry
asked that Avtex be ordered to make certain repairs at the plant.
   The other lawsuit sought $19.7 million and was filed Nov. 2 on
behalf of the state Water Control Board for violations of the
company's national pollution discharge elimination permit. Avtex
closed the plant the next day, then reopened a week later after NASA
and the Pentagon guaranteed about $40 million in contracts.
   Avtex, the sole supplier of a type of rayon used in the space
shuttle, agreed to reduce employee exposure to carbon disulfide gas.
The chemical is used to make rayon and can cause a variety of
ailments, some fatal.
   It also agreed to stop discharging untreated wastewater from the
rayon process and to comply with existing and future pollution
discharge permits.
   Avtex is required to place $5.7 million in a trust fund to pay
for necessary repairs and changes.
   The provisions of the water quality settlement will be subject to
approval by the Water Control Board following 30 days for public
review, and approval by Gov. Gerald L. Baliles.

<HEAD>Europe, U.S. Square Off On Farm Subsidies</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with U.S. comment</NOTE>

   The European Economic Community and the United
States skirmished over farm subsidies on Saturday as trade ministers
of more than 100 nations began arriving for global free-trade talks.
   The EEC is under heavy pressure from the United States as well as
major grain-exporting nations, such as Argentina and host Canada, to
reduce the protection it gives its farmers.
   ``It's very clear that many divergences still exist (on
agriculture). I hope (U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard) Lyng is
coming in like Santa Claus with a bag full of realistic proposals,''
Willy de Clercq, the EEC's minister for finance and foreign trade,
said in a news conference.
   However, U.S. negotiators stuck to a tough line. ``No deal is
better than a bad deal,'' Alan Holmer, a top U.S. delegate, said in
a separate press conference.
   Trade ministers of 105 countries, including 96 member nations of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, began arriving Saturday
for the midterm review of free-trade talks under the auspices of the
GATT.
   U.S., European, Japanese and Canadian negotiators met in an
informal session on Saturday to review the prospects for the talks,
which officially begin Monday.
   Holmer said the meeting ``crystallized the differences that
exist'' between the parties, apparently referring mainly to the
dispute over farm subsidies.
   Michael Samuels, a U.S. negotiator, said cutting farm subsidies
would save money for taxpayers and consumers. The United States
estimates that worldwide subsidies cost $200 billion a year.
   De Clercq said the 12-nation EEC, or Common Market, believes a
compromise on agriculture is possible in Montreal if the United
States drops its demand for a commitment from all the participants
on the total elimination of trade-distorting farm price supports.
   He accused the United States of ``looking for an alibi not to act
in the short term'' by insisting on a long-term solution.
   De Clercq said the EEC is willing to adopt a freeze on
agricultural subsidies in the coming two years and discuss their
reduction, though not total elimination.
   But Samuels, in a later press conference, said setting an
objective of total elimination of subsidies is the best way to make
progress. He said Europe should find ways to protect its rural areas
that do not lead to overproduction of food.
   De Clercq said the EEC would push ahead with efforts to reach
agreement on removing barriers to the export of tropical products
such as coffee, bananas and citrus fruit from developing nations.
   He rejected U.S. demands to link the tropical products issue to
progress in the agricultural negotations.
   The current Uruguay Round of talks began in Punta del Este,
Uruguay, in 1986 and is scheduled to end in 1990.
   It is the most ambitious of the eight rounds of talks that have
been held since the GATT was formed after World War II, including
for the first time such issues as trade in services and protection
of intellectual property such as patents and copyrights.
   The GATT is both an agreement and an organization which has a
permanent headquarters in Geneva.
   The talks are taking place, as usual, largely behind closed
doors. They are theoretically scheduled to end on Wednesday, but are
likely to last into Thursday or possibly Friday.
   Samuels said the representatives of the United States, Japan,
Canada and EEC agreed at their meeting Saturday that an agreement
should be completed Wednesday night so it can be ratified by the
trade ministers on Thursday.

   Police arrested more than 400 people for blocking entrances to
abortion clinics in New York, Ohio and Indiana on Saturday, and just
the threat of a sit-in closed a New Jersey clinic, where protesters
dispersed without incident.
   All of the demonstrations were peaceful and no injuries were
reported, police said.
   ``The goal from the beginning was to lock the doors and save
babies from abortion,'' said Brian Rechten, spokesman for the New
Jersey demonstrators, who he said kept as many as 10 women from
entering the clinic.
   ``We're just trying to give them the other side,'' Rechten said.
``We're not talking about a blob of protoplasm. We're talking about
a human life.''
   The protests are the latest in a series around the country mostly
organized by a group called Operation Rescue and dating to this
summer's Democratic National Convention. Hundreds of people have
been arrested, many staying in jail for extended periods, refusing
to identify themselves.
   New York police arrested about 250 anti-abortion demonstrators in
a failed attempt to shut down a Manhattan Planned Parenthood clinic
that provides abortions, counseling and other health services for
women.
   The protesters prayed and sang, drawing jeers from a handful of
pro-choice advocates. As the anti-abortion demonstrators sang ``God
Bless America,'' their counterparts chanted: ``Sexists, fascists,
anti-gay! Born-again bigots, go away!''
   Mimi Grinker, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman, said the clinic
saw about 25 women during the day, about half the number of patients
that visit on a normal Saturday.
   Those arrested were issued appearance tickets and then freed on
their own recognizance, said Sgt. Norris Hollomon, a police
spokesman.
   In Cincinnati, 77 people were charged with trespassing at a
Planned Parenthood clinic, and three of them faced additional
charges of resisting arrest because they had to be carried to police
vans, authorities said.
   Sara Meyer, a spokeswoman for the demonstrators, claimed success,
saying: ``With the streets blocked off, the `girls' can't get in
there. They've got another day to think about it.'' Ann Mitchell of
Planned Parenthood said the clinic had rearranged its appointment
schedule in anticipation of the sit-in.
   Police arrested 56 people on trespassing charges after about 100
demonstrators blocked entrances to the Akron Center for Reproductive
Health, said Susan Palidar of Cleveland, spokeswoman for the protest
organizers.
   Merrillville, Ind., police arrested 34 anti-abortion protesters
on criminal trespass charges after protesters blocked doors to a
Planned Parenthood clinic. All but two of them were from out of
town, police said.
   More than 50 peaceful demonstrators forced the closure of the
Women's Medical Center, an abortion clinic in Howell Township, N.J.,
but they dispersed about 11 a.m. and there were no arrests, police
said.
   ``Once the clinic closed, that was the end of it,'' said Lt.
Peter Wulfekotte.

   Cleanup crews on a commercial jetliner
found almost 9 pounds of cocaine hidden under two seats, company
officials and police said Saturday.
   The judge leading the inquiry, Gabriel Noboa, ordered the Eastern
Airlines plane held at the airport in this port city until it was
known where the drug came from. No one was arrested.
   The L-1011 flew from Miami to Guayaquil, Ecuador, via Cali,
Colombia, Thursday night. The cocaine was found by cleanup crews
early the next morning, Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said in Miami
on Saturday.
   Gustavo Paez, local general manager of Eastern, appealed the
judge's decision immediately, according to company lawyer Jacinto
Velasquez. ``The drug was found out in the passengers' area and not
in the plane's luggage store,'' the lawyer said.
   Workers from a cleaning contractor found 8.8 pounds of cocaine in
two bags under two seats as they were cleaning the aircraft, police
and company officials said.
   Drug traffickers use Guayaquil as a center of operations. They
move drugs through the city that are bound for the United States and
Europe, according to officials.

   A congregation has voted to keep a
nephew of the Rev. Martin Luther King as its minister after the man
admitted he had undergone treatment for cocaine and alcohol abuse.
   The Rev. Derek King, 34, would have resigned if the congregation
of Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church had offered a better
severance package, church officials said.
   A majority of deacons asked the nephew of the late civil rights
leader to resign after he announced from the pulpit two weeks ago
that he had completed the treatment program.
   But the congregation voted 107-68 on Thursday to keep King,
guaranteeing him the job for another year. He earns $26,000 annually
and pays no rent or utility bills.
   Before the meeting with the congregation, King and his attorney
met for 30 minutes with church officials discussing possible
severance pay options. But King wanted more money than church
officials offered, said Ulysses Kinsey, chairman of the bylaws
committee, and Deacon Alton Seymoure Jr.
   ``He was asking for too much and we weren't going to give him
that,'' Seymoure said.
   Church members who oppose King say they haven't given up their
fight to remove him, but King was hopeful.
   ``I will try to perform as best as I can to satisfy the
members,'' said King.
   Meanwhile, a group of ministers is trying to raise money for
King. His wife Janice is four months pregnant, and the family
apparently has little money.

<HEAD>Connecticut Metal Company Fined In Acid Spill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOUTH WINDSOR, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A company where a worker died after
inhaling toxic fumes when he fell face-down in a puddle of a highly
corrosive form of acid will be fined $6,480 for various safety
violations, federal officials announced.
   Metals Testing Co. of South Windsor was cited for eight
infractions, some of which contributed to the October death, said
Brenda Gordon, industrial hygiene supervisor at the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration's Hartford office.
   The company tests metals for aircraft parts at its plant and uses
hydrofluoric acid to etch titanium parts.
   Timothy Cunningham, 29, of Hartford lost his footing in October
while carrying an open bucket of the acid and fell face-first into
the toxic, highly corrosive substance. Toxic inhalation was listed
as the cause of death, and his body was also burned.
   Two other workers were treated after inhaling the acid fumes.
   ``They (Metals Testing officials) didn't follow appropriate
working practices for handling corrosive materials,'' Gordon said
Friday. ``What caused the death was that the material spilled. It
wouldn't have spilled if it was being carried in a closed
container.''
   Company President Robert J. DeLisle declined comment on the OSHA
findings. The company can appeal the fines, Gordon said.
   OSHA said the citations alleged two counts of insufficient safety
training, two counts of lack of protective clothing, failure to
provide an appropriate first aid facility, failure to post safety
signs, improper labels on chemical tanks, and lack of a proper
eyewash station.

   Thirteen filmmakers trapped more than 250
feet underground in a desert cave slipped to safety one-by-one
through a tiny hole dug by rescuers on Saturday, authorities said.
   The group was trapped when a sudden rainstorm caused the mouth of
the cave to collapse as they were making a documentary film in an
isolated desert known as Nullarbor Plain in southwestern Australia.
   The last of the group emerged Saturday evening from a small
escape route that police said they had managed to dig. Police said
no one was injured.
   However, they described rescue conditions as very dangerous.
   ``It was raining and freezing cold, and they were afraid there
would be another cave-in at any time,'' said police spokesman David
Tree. ``The rescuers had to be very careful.
   ``Police made a hole big enough for them to squeeze through one
at a time, and they came out very slowly.''
   The group was filming a documentary on the system of caverns near
the tiny township of Cocklebiddy on Friday when the storm washed
away rocks, blocking the entrance to the cave.
   Tree said the group, all experienced cave explorers from their
mid-20s to 40 years old, were recovering from their ordeal in
Cocklebiddy.
   Eleven of the group were Australians, and one was from the United
States and one from England. They were identified.
   The Nullarbor is a huge, dry plain with an extensive cave system
underneath.

<HEAD>Father Seeks Custody Of Child Put Up For Adoption</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Florida Supreme Court will hear
arguments this week in a custody battle between a child's biological
and adoptive parents in a case that could curtail privately arranged
adoptions in the state.
   The court is being asked to decide if a man who virtually ignored
his pregnant girlfriend after she refused to have an abortion can
retain the right to challenge her decision to put the baby up for
adoption. The man began the challenge shortly after the baby was
born two years ago, and he also later reconciled with and married
the mother.
   Arguments were scheduled to be heard Tuesday, with a ruling
expected in about a month.
   ``Certainly, it would concern me if the court was to say the
biological father could show up at any point and have the adoption
overturned,'' said Greg Coler, state secretary of health and
rehabilitative services. ``It puts the chance of establishing
permanency for the child at great risk.''
   Paternal rights in adoptions have been in the legal spotlight
recently in several states. Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court heard
a California case in which a man sought visitation rights to his
7-year-old daughter given up for adoption.
   In the Florida case, court documents use assumed names, calling
the adoptive parents Bob and Jane Doe and the biological parents
Richard and Mary Roe.
   Mary gave upthe child up for adoption within 48 hours of his
birth. Richard, who initially had refused to get married and had
urged an abortion, then hired a lawyer, acknowledged paternity and
sought to halt the adoption.
   Richard and Mary were reconciled, and married when the baby was 2
months old.
   In June 1987, a judge ruled against Roe, saying he had
effectively abandoned the child during Mary's pregnancy. The
adoptive parents provided an apartment, paid her medical costs and
gave her $300 a month for expenses.
   A state appeals court reversed the ruling in March, saying the
father's consent was necessary in a privately arranged adoption.
However, the appeals court left the boy with his adoptive parents
until the Supreme Court could review the case.
   Attorney Michael Carbo said a decision for Roe could mean the end
of privately arranged adoptions.
   ``If the putative father could come in and essentially negate the
entire adoption proceeding, because of the fact he wasn't consulted
or he didn't know he was the father at the time, would you invest a
significant amount of time and money in the expenses surrounding the
birth?'' he asked.

<TEXT>
   An synthetic narcotic similar to heroin that
caused at least 13 deaths was produced by a professional chemist in
a basement laboratory at the home he shares with his elderly
parents, authorities said.
   An informant led city, state and federal agents to the home of
Thomas Schaefers, 48, in suburban Aspinwall late Thursday, Assistant
U.S. Attorney Bruce Teitelbaum said Friday.
   Schaefers, jailed on a charge of drug manufacturing, is the
latest of 12 suspects arrested in connection with the drug
3-methyl-fentanyl, also known as China White.
   Besides the 13 deaths confirmed to be caused by the drug, it is
suspected in seven additional deaths.
   Teitelbaum said the informant claimed Schaefers made China White
with ingredients obtained at his job in a Calgon Corp. lab outside
Pittsburgh and from a pharmacist who wrote phony prescriptions.
   Teitelbaum did not identify the informant, who he said is an
addict who got the idea for making synthetic heroin from a
television news report nearly two years ago about so-called designer
drugs.
   The informant took the idea to Schaefers, who began working on
the compound in November 1987 and made a successful batch on his
third attempt, Teitelbaum said. In addition to that one-ounce batch,
Schaefers made a second, larger batch that netted him and the
informant $14,000 in profits, Teitelbaum said.
   Schaefers has a bachelor's degree in chemistry and has been a
staff chemist at Calgon's industrial water treatment research center
in Robinson Township since 1977, said company spokesman Tom Erdner.
   Calgon officials promised to cooperate with police.
   Six people suspected as leading distributors of the drug also
were arrested Thursday. Five others were charged earlier.

   An official of the Chernobyl nuclear plant
says he would like to see a joint U.S.-Soviet reactor built to help
prevent future accidents.
   ``I think that only by joint efforts can we create a new, modern
type of reactor which could exclude the negative impact on the
environment and exclude the possibility of such accidents which
happened at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl,'' Mikhail Borisyuk,
deputy secretary of Chernobyl, said in an interview Friday.
   Borisyuk is one of 10 Soviets and 11 Americans on the Global
Environment Commission of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Emerging Leaders Summit,
a weeklong gathering of more than 340 Americans and Soviets that
began Thursday.
   The delegates spent much of Saturday watching the Army-Navy
football game at Veterans Stadium and visiting the Liberty Bell and
Independence Hall.
   Ilona Zheleznyako, 30, a housing construction engineer from
Tinda, Siberia, touched the historic bell, which rang in July 1776
to announce the adoption of the Declaration of Independence. She
said she felt ``a good feeling of freedom and liberty.''
   Sergei Chelnokov, 34, said he was impressed with the longevity of
the U.S. Constitution.
   ``In our country ,there is a rethinking of some of the ideas of
our revolution, and we are now reconstructing a society which is
only 70 years old,'' he said. ``So it is amazing that something that
is three times as old is still working.''
   The summit is focused on private meetings of 16 commissions
assigned areas of discussion such as the environment, military
affairs, religion, science, business, the media and the arts.
   The Global Environment Commission will look at such topics as
global warming, ozone depletion, acid rain, ocean waste, economic
development and international agreements.
   The conference comes as the Soviet Union has begun re-examining
conservation practices and giving citizens a greater voice in
environmental protection.
   The 1986 explosion and fire at Chernobyl was the world's worst
nuclear accident. It killed at least 33 people, sent a radioactive
cloud around the globe and made an area within a 40-mile radius of
the plant uninhabitable.
   At Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island reactor, equipment failures
and human error led to a loss of coolant and partial core meltdown
in 1979.
   ``The main lesson is the imperfection of technology that is used
at atomic power plants both in the United States and in the
U.S.S.R., and also imperfection of personnel training,'' Borisyuk
said.
   He said he believes nuclear energy remains the safest and
least-polluting form of energy, if properly managed.

   A man threatening to blow the CBS network studios
to ``kingdom come'' demanded to read a statement on camera about a
child custody fight but surrendered an hour after the standoff began
Saturday, police said.
   It turned out the suitcase the man carried held ``a brick and a
bunch of wires,'' said Sgt. Ed Burns, a police spokesman.
   The man, Rocky Martuchi, 45, of Staten Island, was charged with
menacing and reckless endangerment, police said.
   Martuchi had entered the CBS Broadcast Center lobby and called
upstairs to the WCBS newsroom, saying, ``The law took my daughter
and I have a three-page letter I want to read to the cameras,''
according to Tom Farkas, assignment editor.
   ``I've got a suitcase here that would take this building into
kingdom come,'' Farkas quoted the man as saying.
   The man's letter outlined his problems stemming from a 1984
family court arrangement, said Deputy Police Inspector Peter
Scalabrino.
   Martuchi wanted to speak with a reporter, but agreed to allow a
police cameraman to make a videotape of his statement, the inspector
said.
   ``I think he wanted to get on camera to tell people what his
trouble was,'' Scalabrino said.
   The building on West 57th Street in mid-Manhattan also contains
CBS network studios and is the home of ``60 Minutes'' and ``West
57th Street.''
   An X-ray indicated that the item in the suitcase was only a
brick, police said. But as a precaution, the suitcase was not opened
until it was taken to a bomb disposal facility in the Bronx in a
special bomb-containment truck.

<HEAD>Hawaii Catholics Protest $45 Million Sale Of Church Property</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Clergy and parishioners of a Roman Catholic
church Saturday criticized their bishop's decision to sell to
Japanese investors the ocean-front land on which their parish has
worshiped since the 1830s.
   The $45 million deal, which will result in the demolition of the
copper-roofed, modernistic St. Augustine Church in the heart of
Waikiki and the building of a new church nearby, was announced
Friday by Bishop Joseph Ferrario of Honolulu.
   Diocese offices were besieged with phone calls Friday and
Saturday after news reports of the sale. The diocese hired a public
relations firm to help field the calls.
   An advertisement taken out in the major daily newspapers here
Saturday urged Catholics to protest by writing to the Vatican in
Rome, which would have the power to overturn Ferrario's decision.
   The church, built in 1962, is situated on a 50,000-square-foot
parcel where the Sacred Hearts Fathers have led services since a
thatched missionary church was built in the 1830s. Members of the
order and the congregation complained that the deal went through
without their approval.
   ``I thought they were going to take our feelings into
consideration,'' said Adeline Trask, one of about 35 parish members
invited to a meeting with the bishop in May to discuss unsolicited
offers that were being made for the church property amid a land boom
fueled by Japanese investments.
   The purchaser announced Friday is Hama Kikaku, a Tokyo real
estate company. The company agreed to allow the church to remain
free of rent for 2{ years while a new church is built several blocks
away on property also owned by Hama Kikaku, the Honolulu Diocese
said.
   After the new church is built, $25 million will be left for a
variety of educational and charitable causes, Ferrario said.
   ``I really think this use of real property is a real stewardship
of our properties,'' he said. ``It's a question of justice _ the
haves serving the have-nots, of respecting the rights of people of
the parish.''
   At $45 million, the property is going for $900 a square foot,
compared with $400 a square foot in other recent sales of similar
Waikiki property.
   The Rev. Louis Boeynaems, a retired priest who served as St.
Augustine Church pastor from 1980 to 1983, said, ``Many priests are
flabbergasted that he (Ferrario) doesn't consider the history of the
place.''
   Newspapers here reported that company officials could not be
reached for comment on what they intended to do with the property,
but there was speculation that a luxury hotel or condominiums would
be built. The property is across the street from Waikiki beach,
whereas the new site the church would be given is several blocks
from the beach.

   Police captured a communist rebel
officer outside the U.S.-run Subic Bay naval base as he was on his
way to deliver weapons to guerrillas operating near the
installation, police said Saturday.
   Meanwhile, the military reported at least 21 people were killed
since Thursday in scattered clashes between government forces and
the New People's Army, which has been waging a 19-year insurgency to
establish a communist state in the Philippines.
   Police Lt. Col. MacArthur Torres said Roberto Tutanes, 35, a
political officer of the outlawed communist Party of the
Philippines, was apprehended Friday in a district of Olongapo, home
of the Subic Bay installation about 50 miles west of Manila.
   Torres, chief of the Olongapo district police command, said
Tutanes was carrying ammunition and was believed on his way to meet
local rebels when he was captured.
   Torres said Tutanes had been under surveillance for a month, and
the military had offered a $1,500 reward for his arrest.
   Also Saturday, the military said rebels ambushed a Philippine
army jeep near Orion on the Bataan peninsula, about 20 miles
southeast of Subic Bay.
   A Filipino company commander, Lt. Ruben Sarte, was killed and two
soldiers were wounded in the Thursday incident, the military said.
   About 13,000 U.S. troops, Defense Department civilians and
military dependents are permanently stationed at Subic, although the
number swells considerably when aircraft carriers and other vessels
call at the port.
   Subic is one of six American military installations in the
Philippines. In October 1987, rebels killed three Americans and a
Filipino of U.S. descent outside Clark Air Base, 50 miles north of
Manila.
   The rebels have threatened to attack other American military and
civilian personnel but have not killed more since the Clark
incident. The U.S. Embassy estimates there are up to 100,000
Americans living in the Philippines.
   In other engagements, three government militiamen and a civilian
were killed Friday when rebels attacked a military checkpoint near
Cauayan on Negros island, the military reported.
   The rebels burned the outpost before escaping with three M-16s,
five M-1 Garands, two Carbines, a grenade launcher and 2,000 rounds
of assorted ammunition, the military added.
   On Thursday, government forces claimed they killed 15 rebels when
guerrillas attacked a town hall. One policeman was also killed in
the battle, and nine soldiers were wounded later when guerrillas
ambushed troops sent to chase the rebels after the raid on the San
Jorge town hall.

   The La Scala chorus and dance company called
off their strike and returned to rehearsals Saturday night, clearing
the way for Wednesday night's opening of the opera season.
   Earlier in the day, the more than 200 artists had voted to
continue boycotting rehearsals to protest a labor contract they say
favors the orchestra. They have been disrupting rehearsals for
several days.
   But after closed-door talks with the management Saturday night,
the artists announced they were calling off the job action and
immediately resuming rehearsals of Gioacchino Rossini's ``William
Tell.''
   A theater management official, Gianfranco Maris, told reporters,
``All the misunderstandings seem to be cleared up and the Dec. 7
inaugural should go ahead as scheduled.''
   Maris said the artists were told that the contract was not final
and they could hold a referendum later in the month on whether they
accept its terms.
   The opera is directed by Riccardo Muti and stars American tenor
Chris Merritt.

   Police confirmed Saturday they were
investigating eight suspicious deaths of elderly residents of a
nursing home in this Grand Rapids suburb.
   Police said earlier that the investigation was limited to the
deaths of Marguerite Chambers, 60, and Edith Cook, 98, whose bodies
underwent autopsies after being exhumed last week.
   But Police Chief Walter Sprenger said during a Saturday news
conference that Chambers and Cook were among eight Alpine Manor
Nursing Home residents whose deaths during the first six months of
1987 were under investigation.
   Sprenger said police have not determined a motive. He would not
elaborate on potential suspects, saying: ``We're trying to focus in
on who are the specific suspects. We have rumors, we have names, we
have a list of names.''
   Autopsies were not conducted at the time the patients died
because the deaths were considered natural at the time.
   But Sprenger said detectives began investigating the deaths in
early October, using a list of ``eight potential victims'' provided
by a source he would not identify.
   ``We've continued on because we are convinced that something has
occurred,'' Sprenger said, adding that police were investigating
reports that some victims had been suffocated.
   Results of an autopsy on Chambers were inconclusive, and results
of a Saturday autopsy on Cook were not immediately available,
Sprenger said. At least one other body might have to be exhumed, he
said. Three of the eight were cremated.
   A woman answering the telephone at the nursing home Saturday
evening referred all questions to a public relations firm. There was
no answer there.

   Candles were lighted in the windows of homes
across the country Saturday as Jews began celebrating the eight-day
Festival of Lights, or Hanukkah, which commemorates the victory of
the Jews over the Syrians 2,000 years ago.
   Israel radio broadcast festive songs throughout the night, and
bakeries served the special sugar-coated jelly doughnuts that are a
holiday tradition.
   Hanukkah marks the victory of the Jews over the Greco-Syrian
kingdom in 165 B.C. The kingdom had tried to impose its culture on
the Jews and desecrated the holy temple in Jerusalem with statues of
Greek gods. The statues were regarded as pagan idols, which are
anathema to Jews.
   The Jews rose in revolt, destroyed the statues and drove the
Syrians out of Israel.
   According to legend, when the Jews tried to relight the temple's
eternal flame, they found enough oil for one day. But the fire
miraculously lasted for eight days.
   To commemorate the holiday, candles are lighted at sunset for
eight consecutive nights. They are placed one at a time in a special
eight-branch candelabra called a menorah.
   Fried foods such as potato pancakes and doughnuts are eaten to
commemorate the miracle of the oil.
   The festival is celebrated by religious and secular Jews as a
holiday that not only marks the ancient Jewish victory but also
reminds Israelis of their desire to perpetuate national Jewish
identity.

   A man who gave himself up to
police in England was charged in Northern Ireland on Saturday with
the 1974 slayings of a woman soldier and a police detective.
   John Marian O'Callaghan, 34, a former local councilor in Tralee,
in the Republic of Ireland, walked into a police station in
Tunbridge Wells, south of London, on Thursday and was transferred to
the British province.
   He appeared, dressed in parka and jeans, at a special court in
Omagh, County Tyrone, amid tight security Saturday night.
   O'Callaghan was accused of murder in the killing of Eva Martin in
a mortar bomb attack on the Ulster Defense Regiment base in Clogher,
Country Tyrone, on May 2, 1974. Mrs. Martin was a Greenfinch, a
woman member of the UDR.
   O'Callaghan was also charged with murdering Detective Inspector
Peter Flanagan, who was shot to death in a pub in Omagh in August
1974.
   The suspect was ordered to appear in Magistrates Court Dec. 16.
   The predominantly Protestant province has been torn for two
decades by sectarian violence between the mainly Roman Catholic
Irish Republican Army and Protestant extremists. The IRA wants to
drive the British out of the province and unite it with the
overwhelmingly Catholic Republic of Ireland.

<HEAD>Bar Files Disciplinary Charges Against Marvin Mitchelson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Celebrity divorce lawyer Marvin Mitchelson has
been hit with new charges by the State Bar of California for
allegedly refusing to pay for $1 million in jewelry bought in
Switzerland.
   The two charges filed last week carry disbarment as the most
serious penalty, said Victoria Molloy, who filed the charges for the
Bar's office of chief trial counsel.
   Mitchelson is accused of bidding on two pieces of jewelry once
owned by the late Duchess of Windsor at an auction in Geneva in
April 1987 knowing that he did not intend to pay for them on time, a
written statement of the charges said.
   Bidders were told they had to pay for the items within seven
days, the statement said.
   In a second charge, Mitchelson allegedly told the auctioneer,
Sotheby's, that he would pay for the two items with an imminent fee
from a divorce case, the statement said.
   There was no home telephone number listed for Mitchelson. He did
not immediately return a call placed Saturday evening to his
answering service.
   However, Mitchelson said in court papers that Sotheby's had
agreed to extend credit to him and let him keep the jewelry.
   Nevertheless, Sotheby's accuses Mitchelson in court papers with
undue delays and lack of candor.
   The State Bar said last month that it had more than 20 complaints
about Mitchelson, including allegations of mishandling client money,
charging excess fees and failing to perform promised work. It said a
disciplinary hearing is expected to occur in January.

   Four Soviet gunmen who seized a busload of
children in southern Russia and then traded them for a $3.3 million
ransom and a plane to Israel were sent home Saturday with the
airplane crew they held hostage.
   The four hijackers left in two planes with the eight-member
Aeroflot crew that brought them to Israel and a 19-member Soviet
delegation that arrived Saturday to arrange the return, officials
said.
   Preparations for the departure were shown live on Israel
television, with soldiers guarding the runway at Ben-Gurion Airport
near Tel Aviv.
   The Soviet Union's Tass news agency later reported that the
planes landed at Moscow's Sheremetyevo-1 airport at about 6 p.m.
EST. Tass said the ransom money was returned to the Soviet Union.
   The Soviet Union had requested extradition of the hijackers, but
ultimately Israel deported them as illegal immigrants. Foreign
Ministry spokesman Alon Liel said this helped ``shorten the
process.''
   As a condition for returning the hijackers, Israel received
assurances the four men would not face the death penalty, Liel said.
Israel radio reported that one of the hijackers requested political
asylum in Israel, but Liel said he could not confirm that.
   Originally, there were believed to be five hijackers. However, it
was determined that the wife of one of the hijackers was not part of
the plot. Tass identified her as a hostage.
   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, Israeli army chief of staff, called the
hijackers Friday ``simple criminals with a lot of money who wanted
to flee the Soviet Union.''
   The saga began Thursday, when the four gunmen seized a bus
carrying 30 schoolchildren on an excursion in Ordzhonikidze, a city
900 miles southeast of Moscow in the Russian Republic. After hours
of negotiations, the gunmen traded the children for an Aeroflot
jetliner out of the country, a flight crew of eight and a ransom of
$3.3 million.
   A teacher on the bus, Natalya Efimova, told state-run Soviet
television that one of the gunmen announced to the children, ``I
will release anyone who will burn his red scarf.'' The teacher said
the children, who wear the scarves as part of their school uniforms,
stuffed them in their pockets to reduce the provocation.
   The Aeroflot jet landed in Israel Friday evening and the Soviets
surrendered soon afterward. They were immediately taken to a prison
near Tel Aviv. The released crew spent the night in a Tel Aviv hotel.
   The deportation Saturday ended two days of unusual diplomatic
contacts, during which U.S. officials played a role in getting the
hijackers to Israel and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
thanked the Israelis for returning them.
   Liel said Shevardnadze met with an Israeli consular delegation in
Moscow on Saturday ``to express the thanks and deep appreciation of
the Soviet government and Soviet people regarding the noble way the
government of Israel has dealt with this barbaric act.''
   Relations between the two nations have gradually been warming
over the past few years. Moscow severed diplomatic ties in 1967
after Israel captured land from its Arab allies during the Middle
East war.
   Israel television quoted Foreign Minister Shimon Peres as saying
he hoped Israel's handling of the incident would lead to greater
understanding between his country and the Soviet Union.
   Early in the drama, the United States acted as an intermediary to
help the two nations compensate for the lack of formal diplomatic
ties, Defense Ministry spokesman Eitan Haber said.
   Two of the Soviets were sent back on the Ilyushin-76 that brought
them to Israel. The other three were returned in a Tupolev airliner
that brought the Soviet delegation to Tel Aviv on Saturday.
   Soviet officials also were given the ransom money and the weapons
carried by the hostages after signing a receipt for them, Israel
television reported.
   Army radio said the five were taken blindfolded from Abu Kabir
jail in Tel Aviv to Ben-Gurion about two hours before their
departure.
   In Moscow, Vitaly A. Ponomarev, deputy KGB chief, identified the
ringleader of the group as 38-year-old Pavel L. Yakshiants.
Ponomarev said the man was a drug-user who first asked to go to
Pakistan.

   Would-be millionaires snapped up lottery tickets
at a rate of 28,000 a minute Saturday, lining up for a chance for at
least $45 million, New York's biggest-ever jackpot.
   There was no immediate word on whether anyone had chosen the
winning combination chosen late Saturday, which was heavy on the
number 8: 1-8-13-18-28-48. Lottery officials said it would probably
take until sometime Sunday for computers to calculate the final
jackpot and determine whether anyone got it.
   ``I actually wouldn't know what to do with that kind of money.
But I bet I'd suddenly find a lot of friends to help me spend it,''
said Noreen O'Brien of Cliffside Park, N.J.
   If a single ticketholder won the $45 million Lotto jackpot, he
would get about $1.7 million a year for 20 years after withholding
taxes. The odds of winning the biggest jackpot in the 12-year-old
state lottery were 12.9 million to 1.
   For a $1 ticket, a player chooses two combinations of six numbers
from 1 to 54.
   Lines stretched outside stationery, tobacco and drug stores
throughout the state in temperatures mostly in the upper 40s.
   The pace started picking up Friday evening, when sales increased
from 18,000 a minute to 22,000 at the 5,800 computerized ticket
outlets statewide.
   By Saturday morning, they reached 28,000 tickets a minute, said
Bill Knowlton, a spokesman for the lottery.
   The jackpot rose to a guaranteed $45 million after no one picked
the winning numbers in Wednesday's drawing, when the jackpot was $26
million.
   Acting Lottery Director Russell Gladieux said Friday the jackpot
could go slightly higher, depending on sales.
   The world's biggest lottery jackpot, $61.98 million, was divided
among three tickets in California in October; one ticket was held by
25 co-workers and another was held by 15.
   The largest single winner was a Florida woman who claimed $55.16
million in September.
   The largest previous jackpot in New York was $41 million in 1985.
That was divided among three winning tickets, including one held by
21 factory workers.
   The biggest single winner in New York state lottery history was a
man who won $30.5 million in 1986.

<HEAD>Report: Nir Claimed Secret US-Israeli Agreement For Covert
Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Israeli linked to the Iran-Contra affair who
died in a plane crash last week said in June that a secret
U.S.-Israeli agreement authorized counterterrorist operations he
supervised with former White House aide Oliver North, The Washington
Post said in its Sunday editions.
   Amiram Nir, the former Israeli official who died in a crash in
Mexico on Wednesday, told the Post last summer that the agreement
authorized still-secret operations that he and North supervised in
1985-86, the newspaper said.
   The Post said American and Israeli sources confirmed the
existence of the Israeli-American agreement, referred to as ``terms
of reference'' or ``accords'' by some knowledgeable sources. The
paper said the agreement never was disclosed to Congress.
   Nir, who served as an adviser on counterterrorism to two Israeli
prime ministers, maintained that the secret U.S.-Israeli covert
operations were authorized by an agreement signed by President
Reagan and then-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, said the Post.
Other sources said the agreement was signed at a lower level in the
two governments, the newspaper said.
   Although few details of these operations have been disclosed, the
paper said, Nir said the Israeli government has detailed records of
all of them.
   The Post said one operation conducted under the agreement was the
organizing of an armed force of Lebanese Druze in Beirut in May
1986, at a time when the White House was considering the use of
force to try to free American hostages in Lebanon.
   As described by Nir, the agreement led to a series of covert
actions that had common tactical elements, according to the Post.
The secret transactions that led to the diversion of U.S.-Iran arms
sales profits to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua may have fit a
pattern established in those undertakings, the newspaper said.
   Nir was interviewed by Post reporter Bob Woodward on June 25 and
June 26 in London, with an agreement that none of the information
would be attributed to him without further discussions, the
newspaper said.
   Nir told the Post in October that he still was not ready to ``go
public'' with the information, the newspaper said. It said Post
editors concluded that Nir's death removed the reasons for the
agreement to withhold attribution of the information he had provided.
   Roman Popadiuk, a White House spokesman, declined comment on the
story.
   Officials at the Israeli Embassy were unavailable for comment
late Saturday. But embassy spokesman Yossi Gal told the Post: ``I
won't go into this agreement. ... Israel and the United States have
lots of agreements. ... Everything he (Nir) did was being done by
the government of Israel.''
   Nir told the Post that Israel had assembled extensive records,
based in part on his detailed notes and papers, that were not turned
over the United States. The records provide point-by-point
documentation of all contacts, discussions and undertakings with
U.S. officials, including North, Nir said.
   Nir said he also provided full written reports to his superiors
and gave oral briefings to Peres, the Israeli prime minister who
hired him, and later to Peres' successor, Yitzhak Shamir.
   North, who is under indictment in the Iran-Contra case, suggested
during testimony heard by U.S. congressional investigators that the
plan to divert money to the Contras was Nir's idea. Israel denied
that.
   The agreement is among the classified documents that North's
lawyers are seeking to introduce into evidence at the former White
House aide's trial, the Post said, citing an unidentified source. It
said North's lawyer, Brendan V. Sullivan, declined to comment.
   Nir was an important liaison in the secret arms deals, according
to testimony before the congressional investigators. His activities
included trips to Iran and Western Europe.
   He was sought for questioning by independent counsel Lawrence E.
Walsh, but Israel insisted that he be granted immunity from
prosecution.

   President Raul Alfonsin on
Saturday ordered the army to crush a three-day revolt by rebel
troops, and thousands of citizens poured into the streets to rally
for democracy.
   Alfonsin went on national television after government troops
allowed hundreds of mutinous, heavily armed soldiers to leave an
infantry school they had seized and move to another military base.
   Alfonsin told the nation that he has ordered the army to
``suffocate'' the rebellion. Argentine news agencies later reported
heavy troop movements, which they interpreted as preparations by
loyalist forces to end the rebellion.
   Local news agencies said scores of angry civilians hurled rocks
at the military compound where the rebels were holed up about 12
miles outside of Buenos Aires, and that the rebels responded with
tear gas and shots fired into the air.
   The leader of the rebels, Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin, insisted in
a statement read to reporters by a subordinate that his rebellion
``lacks political motivation and was initiated for military
reasons.''
   The country's democratic institutions ``are not in danger,'' it
said.
   The mutinous soldiers began their revolt Thursday to protest the
criminal trials of officers who have been charged with committing
human rights abuses during the military dictatorships that ruled the
country from 1976-83.
   Alfonsin described the revolt as a ``seditious attempt'' against
``well-being, tolerance and liberty.'' He assured citizens that the
revolt ``does not endanger the republic nor the ... constitution.''
   The government broadcast repeated pleas on national television
Saturday for citizens to rally for democracy. Thousands of people
were reportedly gathering in streets and squares nationwide,
including about 5,000 in Buenos Aires.
   Several ambassadors arrived at the Congress building in Buenos
Aires, including Theodore Gildred of the United States. ``We are
here to lend our complete solidarity to the consolidation of
democracy,'' Gildred said.
   The U.S. Embassy issued a statement that said President Reagan
and President-elect George Bush sent ``their firm and unwavering
support'' for Argentine democracy.
   Alfonsin met with aides and Cabinet members Saturday in the
heavily guarded Government House. Congress also met in an emergency
session on Saturday.
   Congressman Cesar Jaroslavsky of Alfonsin's governing Civic
Radical Union Party called on citizens to ``go into the street to
defend democracy.''
   ``This is the moment,'' Jaroslavsky said.
   He acknowledged that loyal armed forces members ``have not been
able to dominate the rebels.''
   Juan Carlos Pugliese, president of the House of Deputies, said
``Democracy is in danger,'' and called the insurrection ``a clear
coup attempt.''
   The insurrection began Thursday when about 400 soldiers deserted
their posts under the leadership of the charismatic Seineldin.
   The group, joined later by about 50 coast guard members, seized
an infantry school Friday morning at the giant Campo de Mayo
military base 22 miles northwest of the capital.
   Government forces surrounded the base and exchanged several
rounds of mortar and rifle fire with rebels Friday, during which
four people were wounded, the army said Saturday.
   News reports said one person was killed, but there was no
official confirmation.
   On Saturday, the rebels left the base. Government forces did not
fire on the rebels, the official news agency Telam said. It said the
rebels drove past government troops aboard several trucks loaded
with weapons and ammunition.
   Telam said the rebels arrived later at a motorized military unit
in Villa Martelli about eight miles away. The unit's officers
earlier had been reported as sympathizing with the rebels.
   The rebels fortified their positions and set up snipers. At least
six tanks were seen.
   Several explosions were heard outside the base late Saturday
night, the private news agencies Noticias Argentinas and Diarios y
Noticias reported. Telam said lights at the base went out shortly
afterward.
   More than 100 area residents showed their opposition to the
rebels by shouting insults and stoning a car as it entered the base
and rebels responded with tear gas, the reports said.
   Presidential spokesman Jose Ignacio Lopez acknowleged Saturday
that Cabinet ministers and military chiefs meeting at Government
House were ``nervous,'' and noted the presidential guard was being
reinforced.
   ``If a group of rebels moves from one place to another and you
don't know where they're going, the least you have to do to protect
the president is reinforce the guard,'' he said.
   Military uprisings in 1987 and in January were led by Lt. Col.
Aldo Rico, now discharged and imprisoned. They were called to
support fellow officers being prosecuted in civilian courts for
human rights abuses during the dark days of Argentina's military
dictatorships.
   During the dictatorships, at least 9,000 Argentines
``disappeared'' and were presumed executed by security forces.
   In December 1985, five former junta members, including former
military presidents Jorge Videla and Roberto Viola, were convicted
in civilian court for crimes including kidnapping, torture and
murder.
   The military President Isabel Peron in 1976. Alfonsin, a human
rights activist, was elected president after the military junta
finally allowed elections in 1983.

   A strong aftershock of an earthquake that
devastated a remote region of southwestern China killed at least one
person, injured 24 and toppled more than 1,000 homes, newspapers
reported Saturday.
   The aftershock, which registered 6.7 on the Richter scale
Wednesday afternoon in Yunnan province, also forced the closure of
several schools and a cement factory, Hong Kong newspapers said,
quoting the domestic China News Service.
   An earlier report from China's official Xinhua News Agency said
the aftershock injured 13 people and damaged 620 houses.
   China News Service said the casualties occurred in Lancang
county, which bore the brunt of the huge quake on Nov. 6 that
measured 7.6 on the Richter scale and killed 730 people.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake
as measured by ground motion. A quake of magnitude 6 can cause
severe damage in a populated area.

<HEAD>Reagan Says Soviets Must Level Radar Station To Complete START
Treaty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan has told the Soviet Union a
new treaty to sharply reduce long-range nuclear weapons will be
completed only if a Siberian radar station is leveled.
   In a report to Congress on Friday, the president said Soviet
proposals to convert the disputed Krasnoyarsk installation into an
international space research facility ``would not correct'' its
violation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
   ``We cannot conclude new strategic arms control agreement while
this violation remains uncorrected,'' Reagan said.
   The proposed new treaty would reduce U.S. and Soviet arsenals of
long-range nuclear bombers, missiles and submarines by 30 percent to
50 percent. Negotiations in Geneva were adjourned last month with
the two sides agreeing to resume them in early 1989.
   The report also accused the Soviets of violating the 1972 ABM
treaty by moving radar and electronics equipment to Gomel, about 350
miles southeast of Moscow. And Reagan said the Soviets violated the
Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention of 1972 by maintaining ``an
active offensive biological warfare program and capability.''
   Other ``probable'' violations of test ban and chemical weapons
agreements were alleged in the report, an unclassified version of
which was made public by the White House.
   Reagan informed Congress he had reserved the right to take
``appropriate and proportionate responses'' to Krasnoyarsk, which
the report said violates the ABM treaty's ban on trying to set up a
nationwide anti-missile defense.
   But he stopped short of declaring Krasnoyarsk a ``material
breach'' of the treaty. Such a declaration would be a first step
toward possible U.S. abrogation of the treaty, considered a landmark
in nuclear arms control.
   Some of Reagan's advisers had recommended he take that step.
   Reagan did not tell Congress in the classified report what
measures the United States may take in response to Krasnoyarsk. In
the past, however, U.S. officials said retaining two or three
nuclear Trident submarines that were due to be dismantled was a
possible option.
   However, the president cautioned that ``in order to broaden the
basis for cooperation between our two countries, the Soviets must
correct their violations and noncompliance activities with respect
to the ABM treaty and other arms control agreements.''
   On the other hand, Reagan said, the Soviets had resolved ``to our
satisfaction'' U.S. questions about their compliance with the treaty
to abolish intermediate-range ballistic missiles. That agreement was
signed a year ago.
   These included transporting missile parts to and from repair
shops and moving missiles outside designated zones, a U.S. official
who demanded anonymity told reporters at the State Department.
   Lt. Gen. Colin D. Powell, the president's national security
adviser, said Reagan was not expected to make ``a major issue'' of
U.S. complaints of Soviet treaty violations in his meeting next
Wednesday with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.

<TEXT>
   The final word on fruitcake is out
in time for Christmas after a five-year battle that reached the
highest echelon of German justice.
   In a decision handed down Friday by the Supreme Court, the
distinction of ``Dresden Fruitcake'' was determined to be its
content, not the location of the ovens that produce it.
   The case stemmed from a bakery's complaint that a competitor was
misleading customers by calling its product Dresden Fruitcake.
   Dresden is a city in East Germany famous for producing the
popular fruit and nut cake.
   A lower court ruled the Dresden name was a geographic designation
and therefore misused when applied to baked goods produced elsewhere.
   The high court overturned that decision, saying the label had
been used for years by bakers outside the Dresden area and that West
Germans knew the cake was not produced in Dresden.

   Federal inspectors say they were impressed with
the pilots at Continental Airlines and found no serious flaws with
the management.
   The Federal Aviation Administration reported Friday on the
Continental inspection, conducted in October, which did find some
shortcomings in record-keeping and listed 142 specific items in
which there were technical violations of federal regulations.
   Among the concerns raised by the FAA inspection team were that
Continental pilots on numerous occasions did not get enough rest
between flights, that records were incomplete and that manuals often
were not up to date.
   The inspection by a special team of investigators was similar to
those regularly scheduled at all major air carriers and not prompted
by any specific incident or concern.
   Many of the 142 violations cited in the report were not
considered to be major.
   For example, a flight attendant was found with no flashlight,
``fasten seat belt'' signs were found missing on the back of some
aircraft seats, and an inspector observed two pilots eating their
meals at the same time while at cruising altitude _ all technical
violations of regulations.
   Among other items cited in the report were pilots who failed to
record maintenance discrepancies in a log after items were fixed, a
pilot not making proper altitude callouts during a landing and a
crew failing to use an anti-ice mechanism while descending in
possible icing conditions.
   But the team of FAA inspectors said that overall, ``team members
were very impressed with the professionalism displayed by
Continental cockpit and cabin crews while conducting en route
inspections. Cockpit resource management was evident on all
flights.''
   The FAA report said the inspectors conducted 358 en route
inspections at Continental beginning last Oct. 13.
   The FAA said Continental's management ``is adequate for the scope
of the operation'' but that at times there are problems with the
flow of information from upper and middle management to first-line
supervisors and personnel.
   Flight and training manuals have not been brought up to date
because of the introduction of a wide array of aircraft to the
airline as it expanded and absorbed other air carriers, the FAA
said. Some manuals were not accurate in the location of some
emergency equipment such as fire extinguishers on certain aircraft,
the report said.
   The inspection team said that Continental's training program ``is
in compliance'' with regulations but it said training records did
not always clearly reflect in summary sheets when a pilot's
performance was unsatisfactory.
   In addition, inspectors were not able to adequately determine
whether Continental pilots are in full compliance with flight and
duty regulations because of poor record-keeping.
   ``On numerous occasions Continental Airlines flight crews
received less than the (amount) of reduced rest required by
Continental's operations manual pilot scheduling policy,'' said the
report.

   Prince Juergen von Anhalt qualifies as a
jet-set artist in a literal sense.
   He creates his artwork by standing behind jet engines, throwing
buckets of paint into the air and having the high-velocity
propellant of the engines splatter the colors against his canvas.
   ``The paintings are of course abstract,'' von Anhalt said Friday.
   Their creation also is a little risky, because he has to stand in
the way of the jet's force.
   On Thursday, the platform he stood on at the New Orleans
Lakefront Airport, warming up for his performance today, upended
moments after he stepped out of the jets' 80 mph blast.
   ``Should debris go through the jet engines it could penetrate me
like a bullet,'' von Anhalt said. ``And then the fumes can be
intoxicating.''
   The German artist _ known as His Highness Juergen, prince von
Anhalt, duke of Saxony, count of Asconia and duke of Westphalia _
came to New Orleans at the invitation of grocery store magnate John
Schwegmann and his wife, Melinda.
   Using a Schwegmann-owned airplane, von Anhalt plans to perform
his techno-art today to create a work that will be raffled off for a
University of New Orleans fine arts scholarship fund.
   Von Anhalt will work on an 8-by-8-foot canvas with about 10
gallons of paint.
   Most of his fans say the paintings remind them of volcanoes, the
creation of light or something else explosive, said von Anhalt. Men
generally like his work better than women.
   ``I'm looking for a way to unite different elements,'' he said.
``Now, I'm uniting art with technology and I love what comes out. I
never name my pieces. I number them.''

   Two children were trampled to death and more than
30 were injured in a stampede during a power outage in a school, the
official China Daily said today.
   The report said 1,000 students at a middle school in Datong,
Shanxi province, were leaving classrooms at the end of the day Nov.
22 when the lights suddenly went out, plunging the hallway into
darkness and causing the students to panic.
   The newspaper said teachers and students had complained that the
power company failed to inform the school before switching off the
power, a common practice in China because of severe energy shortages.
   Last December, 28 students were trampled to death when hundreds
panicked on an unlit school staircase. In April, nine students were
crushed to death when their school dormitory collapsed.

   A 115-ton jet made an ultrashort hop when a man
pulled it down a runway for a publicity stunt.
   After three minutes of tugging, David Gauder, 32, failed on his
first attempt Friday to pull the Dan-Air jetliner along a runway at
Gatwick Airport.
   The professional strong man, who last year pulled a 91-ton
Concorde 40 feet, got the Airbus' wheels turning on his second try.
   He pulled the jet 24 seconds to promote a Christmas charity. The
distance was not measured.
   Gauder, who is 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighs 240 pounds, has
also pulled a 40-ton tractor-trailer and halted two moving
powerboats. He won entry in the Guinness Book of World Records in
1985 for preventing two Piper Cherokee light aircraft, pulling in
opposite directions, from taking off.
   His wife, who watched Friday's pull, said ``on our wedding day he
hired a double-decker bus and towed the guests to the reception.''

<TEXT>
   A 13-year-old boy was being held in the
theft of about $50,000 worth of comic books, and the crime had
nothing to do with the youth's fascination with Wonder Woman or
Batman, a detective said.
   The teen-ager was arrested and some of the stolen books were
recovered Thursday, said police Detective Dan Camp.
   The thieves apparently knew which comics to take and their value,
Camp said.
   Another arrest and the recovery of several hundred more comics
was expected later, Camp said.
   The books were taken from Books, Comics and Things on Oct. 21 and
23. In the first break-in, a front window was broken and about
$2,000 worth of comics were snatched. In the second, a rock was
heaved through a side window, and high-priced comics dating back to
the early 1940s were taken.
   ``I've been beating the bushes for a month,'' Camp said. ``Not
just because it's my job, but because it torqued my jaws that they'd
hit it (the store) twice in three days.''
   News of the burglaries appeared in a comic-book collector trade
magazine, resulting in calls from dealers across the country
inquiring how to spot the missing books, said Tracy Scott, the
store's co-owner.
   The stolen comics included rare books published during World War
II featuring stories of superheroes pummeling Nazis and more modern
issues with tales of mutants battling masked villains.
   Some of the comics were found in a trash bin behind the store and
another set was left in a trash bag outside a home, police said.
   The youth was being held at the Wood Youth Detention Center.

   The eight-day Jewish festival of Hanukkah begins
at sundown today, marking the an ancient victory of the Maccabees
over a Syrian attempt to stamp out Jewish worship.
   The holiday is marked by songs, games and gift-giving.
   On the first evening, one candle customarily is lit in an
eight-tapered candelabrum, the menorah, with an additional one lit
on successive days until all eight of them burn.
   The observance recalls the cleansing and rededication of the
ancient Temple in Jerusalem, which the Syrian oppressors had
converted into a scene of pagan idols and prostitution.
   Legend has it that only enough oil was available to keep the
rededicated temple lamps burning for one day, but they miraculously
burned for eight. The holiday lasts through next Sunday.

<TEXT>
   The ``let it burn'' policy, sharply
criticized after fires ravaged Yellowstone National Park, should
stand with minor changes to improve communication, federal officials
said Friday.
   Teams of forest experts who reviewed four of the major fires that
covered about half of Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres last summer
also concluded that management decisions were sound, for the most
part, said Jack Neckels, deputy director of the Rocky Mountain
region of the National Park Service.
   The findings of the teams, which looked at the fires from the
preseason indicators through containment, were released Friday
during a news conference at the National Park Service headquarters.
   ``The teams found that no wholesale changes in the fire policy
are required,'' said Gary Gargill, regional forester of the U.S.
Forest Service.
   ``They found that the policy and the implemented plans need to be
strengthened for some specific acceptable limits on such things as
weather ... and the effects of drought,'' he said.
   The ``let it burn'' policy, which has been adopted by both the
Forest Service and NPS, allows natural fires to burn out by
themselves unless they threaten property or humans.
   It drew wide criticism during the fires at Yellowstone by many
who believed the blazes should have been fought more aggressively.
   The review team reports will be forwarded to a policy-making team
formed by the secretaries of Interior and Agriculture.
   That panel is scheduled to give recommendations on the ``let it
burn'' policy to Interior Secretary Donald Hodel as of Dec. 15. At
that point, another review process, including public comment, will
be conducted.
   Among the weaknesses identified by the reviews was a lack of
uniform definitions for terms, and a need for improved coordination
of fire management directions among the various forests and parks
with similar boundaries.
   Neckels said the latter problem was identified a year ago as a
priority for improving, but was not resolved before the summer.
   ``Where you have boundaries like that, clearly you can't have
that much of a difference,'' Neckels said. ``You have to have better
coordination. We knew that, but we didn't get a chance to fix it
prior to last season.''
   Another problem to be addressed is establishing specific limits
on factors such as weather, the number of fires to allow within a
park, the effects of droughts, he said.
   ``What acreage point should we begin to say, `Whoa.' These are
the things that we have to consider,'' he said.
   During briefings Wednesday and Thursday, review team members said
that ``for the most part, the actions were sound, the decisions were
sound,'' Neckels said.
   ``Certainly there were mistakes that were made; there were things
that we would do differently. But, all in all, certainly I feel good
about what our professional staff and the staff of other agencies
did,'' he said.
   More than 249 fires were identified in the park last summer, the
worst on record in the Northern Rockies since 1910.
   The firefighters concentrated on 13 blazes that were identified
as the most destructive, including one that threatened Old Faithful
and another that forced the evuatation of the communities of
Silvergate and Cooke City in Montana.
   Gargill said 201 fires were suppresssed at 10 acres or less for
an 80 percent suppression rate.
   The two agencies plan to begin working on the problem areas, with
a goal of resolving them by April, he said.
   Setting a fire management policy is sort of like ``building a
church,'' Cargill said. ``You don't size a church for an Easter
Sunday crowd, and this was an Easter Sunday fire.''

   Bev Baker became the first 40-year-old to
serve detention at Dublin High School after she forgot to explain
her son's absence.
   She volunteered for the punishment after Vice Principal Bill
Basacker said her son, David Kayne, would be suspended for failing
to show up for a detention resulting from the unexcused absence.
   Mrs. Baker said her son was sick, but she forgot to call school
officials within 24 hours as required by school rules.
   ``I said that if I didn't do what I was supposed to do, I should
go on detention,'' said Mrs. Baker.
   Mrs. Baker reported to the principal's office Wednesday afternoon
and spent an hour filing papers and trimming posters. ``They said
they couldn't make me do homework, so they'd make me do clerical
work,'' she said.
   The beautician will take off work again next week to serve the
final three hours on her sentence.
   ``I'm trying to teach my son to take responsibility for his
actions,'' she said. ``If he's cutting class, I want him to get
caught. But I, as a mother, am a role model, and I have to take
responsibility for my actions.''

   Here's an equation that students at St.
Joseph's Indian School understand: One 15-passenger Dodge van equals
975,000 Campbell's soup labels.
   They collected and bundled the labels and shipped them off to the
soup company. The van, with air conditioning and an AM-FM stereo,
should arrive any day.
   The school's 186 students took about a year to collect the labels
as part of Campbell Soup Co.'s Labels for Education program, which
for years has offered free equipment to schools and libraries for
labels from company products.
   The school has participated in the program for four years and has
received $47,000 in equipment during that time, said the Rev. Tom
Westhoven, director of development at the Catholic school for Indian
children from troubled families.
   The van will help transport students from their homes to the
school about 120 miles west of Sioux Falls.
   The program did not offer a van as a prize until school officials
requested it, Westhoven said. ``I asked the company to consider
offering a van, and they did finally after a year.''
   When Campbell set the price at 975,000 labels, ``My God, we
almost died,'' he said.

<HEAD>Eastern Airlines Unions Ask Court To Block Sale To Trump</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney for Eastern Airlines argued in
federal court that the unions at Eastern want to stop it ``dead in
its tracks'' by blocking the sale of its shuttle operation, while
the unions argued the company wants to intimidate the unions.
   Both sides began presenting their cases Friday before U.S.
District Judge Barrington Parker in the first of six days of
hearings on the proposed sale of Eastern's Northeast shuttle system
to real estate mogul Donald Trump.
   Eastern and Trump announced in mid-October a $365 million
agreement allowing Trump to buy the shuttle, which provides hourly
flights between New York and Washington and New York and Boston, and
to change the name to the Trump Shuttle.
   But three unions representing pilots, mechanics and flight
attendants at Eastern filed suit, asking that the sale be blocked on
grounds it violates labor laws.
   During opening arguments Friday, airline attorney John Gallagher
said the unions want Eastern ``stopped dead in its tracks'' in its
attempt to make the airline profitable by reducing its size.
   ``No employees are being forced out of Eastern Airlines,'' he
declared. ``All (shuttle employees) can elect to remain at Eastern
Airlines.''
   But lawyers for the three unions countered that Eastern's sale of
the shuttle, which has been Eastern's only profitable operation, is
part of an overall scheme by parent Texas Air Corp. to dismember the
airline.
   ``This is in fact a liquidation,'' declared Joe Guerrieri, a
lawyer for the Machinists union. ``Without the shuttle, there is no
way this airline can make it back to profitability.''
   James Lindsey, an attorney representing Eastern's pilots, said
the unions intend to show that the sale of the shuttle violates
federal laws governing collective bargaining in the airline industry
because it is aimed at putting pressure on the unions.
   Eastern and the Machinists union are in the midst of bargaining
for a new contract.
   ``The sale of the shuttle is being used as shock treatment,''
said Lindsey.
   But Gallagher said the decision to sell the shuttle is not unlike
Eastern's other recent decisions aimed at reducing the airline's
size. In September, Eastern curtailed its flights by 12 percent and
eliminated 4,000 jobs.
   The airline currently employs about 30,000 people including about
700 who work in the shuttle operation. Trump has said he would like
to have the current Eastern employees on the shuttle remain at their
jobs.

   The charismatic leader of
Argentina's latest military insurrection, Army Col. Mohamed Ali
Seineldin, once rejected a medal for his service in the Falkland
Islands war because his troops were defeated.
   Friends and colleagues interviewed Friday described Seineldin,
who was trained in part at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point,
as a widely respected officer known for ultranationalist political
views.
   The 54-year-old officer led at least 400 backers, who holed up in
an army base outside the capital Friday and battled government
troops.
   Seineldin was born a Moslem of Syrian-Lebanese parents but
converted to Roman Catholicism. A superior once described him as
``holding the fanaticism of a convert'' in all his endeavors.
   Despite a distinguished military career, Seineldin was passed
over for promotion to brigadier general last year and faced the
prospect of eventual forced retirement.
   He said Friday he was not seeking to overthrow Argentina's
constitutional government ``but to restore military honor to the
army.''
   Seineldin said he also wanted a review of trials ``that punish
the just and promote the guilty.'' It was an apparent reference to
trials of military officers accused of human rights violations
during efforts by military governments in the 1970s to put down
leftist subversion.
   Seineldin has denied involvement in the disappearance of about
9,000 Argentines during the anti-leftist campaign.
   After spending the last four years in Panama, first as Argentine
military attache and then as an instructor to the Panamanian
National Guard, Seineldin was believed to have returned to Argentina
on Thursday via neighboring Uruguay to lead the revolt.
   He was eager to come home, his wife Marta Alice Labiau told the
private news agency DyN in a telephone interview from Panama,
``because it was beginning to look like he had been sent into
exile.''
   Seineldin was born Nov. 12, 1934, in the town of Concepcion del
Uruguay, 140 miles north of Buenos Aires. His father was a
businessman and citrus grower.
   A graduate of the Argentine Military Academy, he rose rapidly in
rank, specializing in infantry commando tactics.
   He was assigned to lead commandos on the Argentina-Chile border
in 1978 when the two neighbors nearly went to war in a dispute over
three tiny islands.
   Promoted to colonel, Seineldin led a commando unit that
participated in the occupation of the British-held Falkland Islands
on April 2, 1982. The Argentines, who call the islands the Malvinas,
were defeated by a British task force 74 days later.
   When Seineldin was called to testify in human rights abuses
trials in 1984, troops formerly under his command gathered outside
the court to cheer him and shouted, ``We'll go back to the
Malvinas!''

   A hearing on the crash of Delta Flight 1141
closed Friday with Federal Aviation Administration officials asked
why their agency took weeks to distribute a safety bulletin for
takeoff warning systems.
   The Delta 727 crashed on takeoff Aug. 31 at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport, claiming 14 lives. Much of the probe has
turned on whether the plane's flaps were properly set for takeoff,
and whether a flap alarm system worked.
   FAA flight standards officer Ben Tollision was asked why his
office had taken weeks to distribute to Delta officials a bulletin
telling them to immediately service their takeoff warning systems on
Boeing 727s and 737s.
   The warning was prompted by the crash of Northwest Airlines
Flight 255 in Romulus, Mich. in 1987.
   Lane Chandler, principal operations inspector for the FAA's
southern region that oversees Delta Airlines, told the public
hearing Thursday his office had received the bulletin ``on Aug. 30,
or so.'' Delta Flight 1141 crashed Aug. 31 claiming 14 lives.
   The hearing concluded Friday night after about 33 hours of
testimony in which NTSB investigators interviewed experts in an
effort to gather infromation that might find a cause of the crash.
   Board member Jim Burnett said the NTSB will continue the
investigation although the hearing has concluded. The federal agency
continue accepting any new evidence until it drafts a final report
on the crash in about six months.
   Chandler sent a letter to Delta Vice President Harry Alger dated
Sept. 15, 1988, notifying him of ``aircarrier operations bulletin
No. 8-884, takeoff warning systems checks.''
   ``The accident in Dallas has focused the nation on the takeoff
warning system; therefore, we are requesting a little more than your
usual prompt reply,'' said Chandler in his letter to Alger.
   Chandler said in response to questions that ``sometimes it does
take a while to distribute information to working levels, to my
level,'' and explained he didn't specifically know how the June 17
letter was routed.
   Chandler said the bulletin would have been relayed through
several offices and reviewed by several individuals. ``I'm not sure
we call it a dead letter,'' Chandler said.
   Paul McCarthy of the Airline Pilot's Association said his group
was investigating whether the delay in spreading notice of the
inspections was normal or unusual.
   McCarthy also noted that the issue may only be on the periphery
of the public hearing. ``The testing is irrelevant to this
investigation only if it was a no-flap situation,'' McCarthy said.
``We continue to dispute this assertion.''
   ALPA has steadfastly maintained during the federal inquiry that
the three-man Delta crew, who testified earlier, were the victims of
a split-flap configuation in which the plane's outer flaps are
extended or in place for a takeoff while the inner flaps were not.
   A Boeing aerodynamics engineer testified earlier that he believes
Delta Flight 1141, given its recorded speed, could have achieved
flight even with no flaps.

   Step into the mysterious, windowless
Blue Cube, where 2,000 engineers and scientists working furiously
with old, slow computers will soon have a new task _ tracking and
controlling the $500 million spy satellite to be deployed by
Atlantis.
   Giant screens, rows of terminals and bulky machines fill a
warehouse-size room in the military's ultra-secret satellite
tracking center, receiving millions of bits of coded information
each second on the location and operation of hundreds of U.S., NATO
and foreign satellites.
   The Cube can order one of the more than 50 U.S. military
satellites to snap photos of suspected troop movements and drop off
the film in a parachute package to an Air Force plane for a midair
pickup. It can adjust a satellite's orbit, solar energy panels,
cameras or other gear.
   Special attention is focused now on the new ``bird'' to be placed
in orbit Saturday by the shuttle, a radar satellite code-named
Lacrosse that is designed to spy on the Soviet Union and guide the
stealth bomber.
   The Cube, officially called the Consolidated Space Test Center,
is run by the Air Force in the heart of Silicon Valley. Next door
are the NASA Ames Research Center and Lockheed Missiles & Space Co.
Inc.
   Neither journalists nor others without top security clearance are
allowed past the high fences and armed guards surrounding the pale
blue building. However, interviews with Air Force and NASA officials
with access to the Cube, all of whom asked not to be identified,
reveal a beehive of activity as a crack team of physicists,
electrical and mechanical engineers and computer scientists cope
with a crush of signals to and from satellites.
   ``The adrenalin flows, you work 18 hours a day, but you don't
feel tired at all,'' said one veteran of several satellite launches.
``You suffer battle fatigue when it's over, but during the mission
people get really hyped. This is their time and they're going to
make it work. When you run into obstacles because the system is
clumsy, just sheer energy makes it happen.''
   The Cube has been in operation since 1959, virtually from the
start of the space program. Despite the expenditure of several
hundred million dollars to upgrade the computer and data
distribution system over the past six years, most of the computers
in the Cube are two or three generations old.
   They are reliable workhorses, built by International Business
Machines Corp. and others in the 1970s and early 1980s, but are much
slower, less efficient and more expensive to run than newer models
at many companies in Silicon Valley.
   Instead of state of the art, the Cube's tubes and software
programs remain ``antiquated,'' one systems expert said, because of
government procurement policies.
   ``NASA and the military are stuck in this Catch-22,'' the systems
expert said. ``It's hard to sell missions and get money. So people
have to design minimal systems that use equipment from past
missions, and they end up putting systems in place that are terribly
engineered.''
   He added, though, that ``very exceptional people at NASA and the
military make the system work despite the system.''
   Until a few years ago, the Cube was the nation's only control
center for military satellites, a place so secret that officials
used to deny even its existence.
   Located within bazooka range of two highways and close to three
earthquake faults, the Cube's vulnerability led to a $3.5 billion
overhaul to bring it up to date and build a command center with
similar capabilities at Falcon Air Force Station in Colorado
Springs, Colo.
   Those two centers are linked to eight NASA tracking sites around
the world, including Guam, Spain and Australia, as well as other Air
Force stations and a main ground station at White Sands, N.M.
   The Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System, or TDRSS, is used
to keep watch over all satellites, friendly and unfriendly, and any
other ``space junk'' or debris from defunct satellites that could
get in their way.
   TDRSS West, a satellite in orbit 22,000 miles over the western
United States, was the main tracker in space until September, when
the shuttle Discovery placed TDRSS East in geosynchronous orbit
22,000 miles over the Atlantic.
   For the launch of the new spy satellite, the military and
civilian teams in the Cube and in Colorado Springs will take over
control of the satellite from NASA once they get the word ``the bird
is in orbit.''
   Because of secrecy requirements, nearly all the information from
the TDRSS satellites and the spy satellite is fully encrypted.
   The ground station at White Sands, a huge computer complex that
is perhaps the most modern communications facility in the world,
receives the information on two bands: C-band at 56,000 bits per
second and KU-band at 300 million bits per second. The system can
run several channels of each band simultaneously, taking in a total
of more than a billion bits of information per second.
   The signals are then broken up into multiple channels at lower
rates easier to handle, rebroadcast back up to military satellites
and down again to the Cube and Colorado Springs, where they are
monitored by the Air Force round the clock.
   The first job after the shuttle drops off the spy satellite is to
order the firing of positioning rockets to stabilize the satellite
in orbit.
   The exact position and type of orbit are secret, although some
experts call such secrecy ``a silly game,'' since Soviet tracking
stations can tell where all U.S. satellites are anyway.

<HEAD>Gas Victims Still Dying 4 Years After Union Carbide Gas Leak</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: First available for Saturday AMs</NOTE>

   People who stumbled gasping and choking out
of a deadly cloud of gas that leaked from the Union Carbide
pesticide plant four years ago are still dying.
   The official death toll from the world's worst industrial
disaster has reached 3,329. About 20,000 survivors still suffer from
the effects of the Dec. 3, 1984, gas leak, and officials say at
least one of them dies every day.
   ``I have spent more time in hospitals than at home in the last
four years,'' said 15-year-old Sunil Kumar, who lost his parents and
five brothers and sisters to the gas.
   He and his younger brother and sister live on the $4,730 they
received from the government in compensation for the deaths of the
rest of their family.
   Other gas sufferers have been less fortunate. A 60-year-old woman
who identifies herself only as Hakiman said she has been unable to
get financial assistance because she could not provide an address.
   She said she survives by selling empty medicine bottles she finds
on a trash dump near Jawaharlal Nehru Hospital. At night she sleeps
on the hospital grounds.
   ``The government tells me that if I had a home, I would have
gotten some money as assistance,'' she said. ``But I need money to
build a home.''
   Sunil, Hakiman and other gas victims complain of shortness of
breath and eye problems.
   ``The worst effect has been on the eyes and lungs, although there
are numerous cases of total physical impairment,'' said a Bhopal
doctor, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The government has issued strict instructions to doctors and
officials to make none of their findings public while India's $3
billion damage suit against Union Carbide is pending.
   The suit, filed in 1986, has bogged down in the courts. As is
common in Indian legal cases, no quick end is in sight, although the
government tried to step up the pressure a year ago by filing murder
charges against former Union Carbide President Warren Anderson and
other company officials.
   Anderson and the others have not responded to summonses.
   A year ago, the government of Madhya Pradesh, the state that
includes Bhopal, put the gas leak death toll at 2,850. It has
recorded an additional 479 deaths in the last 12 months.
   ``We are registering more than one death per day because of the
effects of the gas,'' said Gas Relief Commissioner S. Sathyam, whose
department records complaints and helps gas victims.
   Most of the victims lived in the shantytowns that popped up
outside Bhopal after Union Carbide and other industries moved to the
central Indian city.
   An estimated 250,000 people _ one-fourth of Bhopal's population _
inhabit the shantytowns and nearby slums that were in the path of
the toxic cloud that formed when liquid methyl isocyanate leaked
from a storage tank and turned into gas. The cloud hit the air at 1
a.m while most people were asleep.
   After the magnitude of the disaster became known, volunteer
groups sprang up with the avowed aim of helping the victims.
   One of these groups, the Poisonous Gas Episode Struggle Front,
won court acceptance to become a third party in India's suit against
U.S.-based Union Carbide and its Indian subsidiary.
   ``Nobody is serious about the case,'' said Vibhuti Jha, the
front's lawyer. ``It is essential that the victims get compensation
at the earliest. We just cannot allow the case to go on.''
   However, most of the volunteer groups and opposition political
parties do not want an out-of-court settlement.
   ``We want multinational companies, which thrive on business in
Third World countries, to be taught a lesson and forced to adhere to
safety requirements,'' said Balkrishna Gupta, a leader of the
Communist Party of India.
   Union Carbide, based in Danbury, Conn., says the gas leak
resulted from sabotage by a disgruntled employee at the plant run by
the Indian subsidiary. The Indian government maintains the leak was
a result of negligence.
   So far, the most tangible relief for gas sufferers has been free
medical care and government payments of $675 to next of kin for each
person who died soon after the disaster.
   Many survivors say they are waiting for money from Union Carbide.
But some, like Sunil Kumar, say financial compensation is not so
important.
   ``We want to see Union Carbide punished for what it has done to
our lives,'' the teen-ager said.

   Atlantis' twin booster rockets were
heading back to land by way of sea today after helping send the
shuttle into space.
   Two ships towed the twin boosters toward Port Canaveral, near the
Kennedy Space Center, after they were recovered in rough seas 160
miles out in the Atlantic Ocean.
   They dropped with parachutes within eight miles of the recovery
ships after Friday morning's successful launch, the second since the
Challenger disaster blamed on booster rockets.
   ``Everything appeared to be very nominal (normal). There appeared
to be no external leakage or anything like that,'' said Jim Thomas,
a motor technical assistant for the Marshall Space Flight Center who
came to Kennedy Space Center for the launch.
   Divers from the recovery ships took a quick look at the boosters,
tossed in rough seas with winds of 20 to 30 knots, and saw no
obvious damage, said NASA spokesman George Diller.
   The divers removed the parachutes that slowed the boosters'
plummet, then attached flotation devices and cables from the
149-foot boosters to the two recovery ships and began removing
pockets of water, NASA said.
   The 200,000-pound steel casings were expected at Port Canaveral
this afternoon. After cleaning and other work here, they will be
returned to the Utah plant of manufacturer Morton Thiokol Inc. for
inspection and refitting.
   The boosters have drawn close attention since their failure was
blamed for the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger explosion that killed all
seven astronauts aboard. The Rogers Commission that investigated the
disaster said a booster O-ring that failed to seal in cold weather
allowed flame to escape and ignited the main fuel tank.
   NASA spent $800 million to make 145 changes in the booster design
and for testing before the Discovery launch Sept. 29. The massive
rockets have 11 major components and are manufactured in four
segments joined at the seams.
   ``There are so many parts, so many things that could go wrong,''
said Thomas. But he added, ``I was not nearly as apprehensive'' as
he was during the Discovery launch. ``On that one, there was a lot
of apprehension. I stood there and cried.''
   When fully loaded with 1.1 million pounds of propellant, each
booster weighs 1.3 million pounds and produces 3.3 million pounds of
thrust that give the orbiter 80 percent of the power needed to lift
it from the launch pad into orbit.

   Israel indicated it will agree to
Moscow's request to extradite five Soviets who hijacked a bus full
of children and then traded it in for a plane to Israel and $3.3
million ransom.
   The hijackers, four men and a woman, gave their guns to Israeli
police and freed eight hostages _ the plane's crew _ Friday evening
after landing at Ben-Gurion International Airport.
   They stepped off the plane clutching bags stuffed with money,
then dumped coins and paper bills onto the tarmac to show they
weren't carrying explosives.
   Some observers said cooperation between Israel and the Soviet
Union on the hijacking could have more than legal implications _ it
could accelerate the process of reconciliation between the countries.

   President-elect George Bush and his staff are

a week that produced only one announcement.
   All week, there was speculation that Bush would make
announcements on more Cabinet members, particularly for the defense
department and other national security jobs. But the only statement
was that Marlin Fitzwater would stay on as White House spokesman.
   Bush, who met Friday with foreign leaders and former presidential

asked him if his appointment process was stalled.
   ``There's no holdup. We're way ahead of schedule,'' he said,
complaining about ``early, premature, needless speculation.''

   President Reagan has told the Soviet Union a
new treaty to sharply reduce long-range nuclear weapons will be
completed only if a Siberian radar station is leveled.
   In a report to Congress on Friday, the president said Soviet
proposals to convert the disputed Krasnoyarsk installation into an
international space research facility ``would not correct'' its
violation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
   ``We cannot conclude new strategic arms control agreement while
this violation remains uncorrected,'' Reagan said.
   The proposed new treaty would reduce U.S. and Soviet arsenals of
long-range nuclear bombers, missiles and submarines by 30 percent to
50 percent. Negotiations in Geneva were adjourned last month with
the two sides agreeing to resume them in early 1989.

   The atmosphere for President Reagan's final
meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has brightened with
positive human rights moves in Moscow and confidence here that the
successful superpower agenda can be passed on to the Bush
administration.
   Gorbachev's decision to end the jamming of U.S.-financed Russian
language broadcasts and to ease restrictions on some Jewish
dissidents seeking exit permits symbolizes both an improved
U.S.-Soviet relationship and the ``pride of place'' human rights has
on the agenda.
   Steps by the Soviet leader to liberalize the Soviet political
system are viewed more cautiously. A foreign policy aide to
President-elect Bush said he did not think Gorbachev's
``democratization'' drive ``has any immediate bearing'' on the
meeting Wednesday on Governors Island.
   ``But as you think towards the future, the effort as it proceeds,
hopefully with application of the rule of law, it is a positive
thing,'' he said Friday. ``This and the end to jamming are the kinds
of steps that create a sense of hopefulness.''

<HEAD>Giant Deal Shows High Bid Can Lose, Brazen Greed Provokes Hostility</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Wall Street buyout artist's victory over a
tough company executive in the struggle for RJR Nabisco Inc. has
reshaped the rules for debt-financed jumbo takeovers, showing
dramatically that the fattest bid doesn't always win and flagrant
greed can backfire.
   Moreover, the hostility and controversy aroused by the conduct of
chief executive F. Ross Johnson in his dogged pursuit of RJR Nabisco
reflects heightened concerns about potential conflicts of interest
when managers try to buy their companies.
   Some even say the fallout from this deal could dampen the
enthusiasm for future management-led takeovers.
   Particularly troubling to many management strategists, and to the
company's directors as well, were Johnson's initial buy-low
approach, his extravagant built-in rewards in the takeover plan and
his evident disregard for the fate of most of the cigarette and food
giant's 120,000 employees.
   Despite the Johnson group's final $112-a-share, $25.2 billion
offer, RJR directors chose the $109-a-share, $24.5 billion
alternative from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., the unchallenged
leader in debt-financed takeovers.
   Kohlberg's victory marked the biggest takeover in history and
capped a tumultuous struggle for the nation's 19th largest
industrial company, which transfixed the financial world, incited
congressional scrutiny and intensified concerns about the growing
piles of debt burdening the American economy through the growing
popularity of so-called leveraged buyouts.
   Although many lessons will be learned from this classic Wall
Street brawl, the ones that will most likely grab the attention of
managers contemplating their own leveraged buyouts are Johnson's
mistakes.
   ``I think one lesson they can draw is not to think they have a
lock on the deal because they are the experienced managers and that
they know the business,'' said Stewart Veale, finance division
manager of the American Management Association, a leading training
and education group in New York.
   ``Another thing is, this very well may be a signal that boards of
directors believe managements have to pay closer attention to
employees,'' Veale said.
   Post-mortem accounts of the Kohlberg-Johnson struggle show RJR
directors were impressed with the buyout firm's commitment to
minimize disruption to the company, while Johnson was determined to
sell everything except the tobacco business to pay off the giant
debt he would assume in the deal.
   The board also appreciated Kohlberg's sensitivty to RJR workers,
while Johnson's offer barely mentioned them.
   ``Ordinarily, boards in the past have taken the position that
they'll accept the offer with the best return to shareholders,''
Veale said. ``This is the first one of significant size where they
didn't reach that determination.''
   To be sure, at least some shareholders will be angry over what on
its face value is a lower purchase price for their stock.
Predictions already are flying that RJR directors will face numerous
lawsuits over their disregard of the so-called business judgment
rule, by accepting the cheaper of two offers.
   But some management and takeover experts say that anger is
misguided, since Johnson's group started with a bid of $75 per
share. Where, they ask, was Johnson's obligation to maximize value
to the shareholders when he offered that price?
   ``I think the real villain in this whole process was Mr.
Johnson,'' said Yakov Amihud, a finance professor at New York
University's Stern School of Business, who has just written a book
about management-led takeovers.
   ``He was the insider with the information. Kohlberg was the
outsider without the information. The knight that saved the
stockholders was Kohlberg, because if they didn't get into it,
Johnson would have walked away with it for $75,'' Amihud said.
``Stockholders should be thankful to Kohlberg.''
   Steven P. Galante, managing director of Buyout Publications,
which tracks trends in debt-financed takeovers, said he believed the
RJR saga will help ``force management to recognize that a
responsible board isn't going to let management get away with a low
bid. Management shouldn't low-ball it.''
   At the same time, Galante, said, the RJR takeover also provided
some useful lessons to directors. The objective bidding process that
collapsed into a free-for-all auction with extended deadlines and
last-minute haggling was something that other boards will likely
avoid, he said.
   ``I think the board in this case was trying to strike a strong
degree of independence, and show it was going to put the company up
to the highest bidder,'' Galante said. ``It turned out to be a
fiasco. It created all this bidding with a lot of uncertainty about
whether the deals could be financed.''
   Ultimately, it may have been Kohlberg's supremacy in financing
other takeovers that led RJR's directors to believe going with the
investment firm's offer was more responsible.
   ``If you were on a buyout team, would you rather be on Kohlberg's
side or the other side?,'' said Carla Hayn, a
mergers-and-acquisitions professor at Northwestern University's
Kellogg business school. ``Kohlberg has a lot more familiarity and
the financial resources to at least ride out any downturn. Where
does Johnson go for money?''
   Even though Johnson presumably knew his business better than an
outsider, Ms. Hayn said, ``It's cheaper to buy a new CEO than to
arrange financing. If I had to cast my stakes, even if Kohlberg did
offer the lower price, I'd be going with someone that has gone
through these kind of transactions before.''

   In other business news this past week:
   _The government said the nation's civilian unemployment rate in
November edged up from a 14-year low to 5.4 percent. Economic
reports for October showed home sales rose 3.5 percent, factory
orders up 1.6 percent, personal income up 1.8 percent, the index of
leading indicators up 0.1 percent, and construction spending up 0.9
percent.
   _In a quarterly report, the government said the nation's economy
grew at a 2.6 percent annual rate from July through September,
slower than the pace in the first half of the year. Corporate
profits also increased, but by only 0.2 percent.
   _Another quarterly report showed the imbalance between what
America imports and sells abroad narrowed to $28.53 billion in the
third quarter, a 5.4 percent decline.
   _The Federal Reserve's district banks reported ``apparently
slower'' growth, moderate wage increases and slightly easing price
pressures in several manufacturing industries.

   In the closing weeks of 1988, Wall
Streeters are still groping for the right prescription to
reinvigorate a stock market that has languished all year.
   While the market's maladies have resisted all remedies, they have
not turned out as severe as they threatened to become after the
crash in October 1987.
   After all, barring a sudden sharp drop this month, stock prices
will close out this year, as they did last year, showing a net gain.
   But that prospect stirred little elation among the brokers who
gathered here this past week for the annual convention of their
principal trade group, the Securities Industry Association.
   Trading volume in all markets remains down, depressing a prime
source of the Street's revenues.
   Individual investors are still opting for the safe haven of
certificates of deposit or money market funds and shunning stocks.
   In addition, the gains the market has managed to record have
stemmed largely from takeover and buyout activity like the bidding
war for RJR Nabisco Inc. that has dominated recent financial
headlines.
   Whatever short-term benefits buyouts bring to brokers and their
customers, most analysts agree they have by no means solved the
problem of restoring confidence in the market.
   On the contrary, they have raised fears of new shocks when the
superstructure of debt created by the buyouts is sooner or later
tested in a business downturn.
   ``In the long term, I think it's unhealthy for the markets,''
said Joseph Hardiman, president of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, which supervises the over-the-counter market.
   Scandals over insider trading and other abuses also still cloud
the outlook.
   ``There is the matter of industry image, or reputation, or
integrity _ call it what you will,'' said Edward O'Brien, president
of the Securities Industry Association. ``It is undeniable that it
has been tarnished in the past few years.''
   While O'Brien argued that some criticisms of Wall Street's
behavior have gone beyond what is justified, he also acknowledged
that they have stung.
   ``In my view, there is no magic potion that can be taken to
produce a happy new world, and national media campaigns are not the
answer,'' he said.
   Then, too, there is the question of whether investigations and
reform measures since the 1987 market collapse have done enough to
restore faith in the mechanism of the marketplace itself.
   Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the American Stock Exchange,
thinks not. He urged that the new administration and Congress
appoint a commission to do a long-term study of the markets.
   More than 13 months after the fact, he said, ``I don't think
anyone understands last October.''
   Those who hold out hope for revived enthusiasm in the near future
say their conviction lies in the very caution and pessimism that are
so prevalent now.
   They point to measures of investment advisory sentiment that have
lately turned as gloomy as at any time since just before the start
of the 1982-87 bull market.
   And indeed, adherents of this school of ``contrary opinion'' made
their presence felt in the past week's trading activity.
   The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 industrials rose 17.60 to
2,092.28.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 2.39 to
153.02; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
added 7.53 to 373.91; and the Amex market value index was up 4.08 to
295.27.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 132.54 million shares a day,
against 107.86 million the previous week.
   With so much money stockpiled in CDs and money market
investments, a drop in interest rates might well give stocks a big
lift, said John Bachmann, a St. Louis brokerage executive who was
chairman of the Securities Industry Association the past two years.
   In the crash, he said, ``the public was bruised and frightened,
but not broken. I suspect we could have a surprisingly good year in
1989.''
