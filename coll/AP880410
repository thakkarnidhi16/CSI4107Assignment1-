   The estranged wife of soul singer James Brown
said Sunday she had been set up on drug charges to pressure her to
drop the assault charges she had filed against Brown after a
beating last week.
   Adrienne Lois Brown said she hopes to reconcile with her
husband, who won a Grammy last year for ``Living in America,'' when
he returns from a South American tour this week. They had already
patched things up somewhat before he left, she said.
   ``I've had a very, very terrible week,'' she said in a telephone
interview from the couple's ranch in Beech Island, S.C., a few
miles across the Savannah River from Augusta, Ga.
   Mrs. Brown, who filed for divorce from her husband after she was
beaten last Monday, was arrested Saturday in the parking lot of
Bush Field airport in Augusta. Police said they had been tipped she
would be receiving a shipment of phencyclidine, a hallucinogen also
called PCP, from New York.
   She was charged with one felony count of possession of PCP and
released on $1,550 cash bond. The same charge was filed against
Ranell T. Wright, 25, of New York, who also posted $1,550 cash bond.
   Mrs. Brown, 38, said a friend of one of her husband's employees
had asked her to pick up Ms. Wright and give her a ride to her
destination in Augusta. She declined to identify the person.
   ``It was a setup,'' she said. ``I was framed because they are
trying to make me drop this case against my husband.''
   Brown, 54, was charged with assault with intent to murder and
aggravated assault and battery after Mrs. Brown was beaten and
shots were fired into her car. He turned himself in to Aiken
County, S.C., authorities and was released Tuesday on $15,000 bond.
   Brown returned to the ranch before he left for his tour late
last week, she said.
   ``We made amends before he left. I did his hair and drove him to
the airport. And he's called every night from Brazil,'' she said.
   ``I did not call the police on him. The neighbors did. But I
can't stop them when guns are being fired,'' she said.
   ``I never wanted a divorce. But what can you do when you're beat
up?'' Mrs. Brown said.

<HEAD>Solidarity calls for May 1 to be day of protests against price
increases.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The outlawed Solidarity labor federation
on Sunday said May 1 should be a day of protests against government
price increases and the lack of union freedom.
   In a statement read over the telephone by Solidarity adviser
Jacek Kuron, the union's National Executive Commission said people
should boycott official May 1 Labor Day observances and hold
demonstrations.
   ``For working people May 1 ... is the holiday of fighting for
elementary rights and a day of protest against price increases and
destruction of independent initiatives, a day for struggle for
union freedoms,'' the statement said.
   ``We desire that May 1 become the symbol of union solidarity so
that it can demonstrate our demand to regain the rights due us and
to legalize the free trade union Solidarity.''
   Kuron said the commission, which met on Saturday to approve the
statement, did not specify what form the protests were to take.
Solidarity has denounced the price increases imposed by the
communist government that are expected to raise the cost-of-living
in 1988 by more than 40 percent.
   Solidarity was chartered by the government during nationwide
strikes in the fall of 1980 but was suspended in December 1981 and
subsequently outlawed by Parliament. It had been the only free
labor federation in the Soviet bloc.

   More than 1,000 people were arrested in a
weekend police blitz against drug dealers and street gangs
responsible for waves of violence that have been claiming hundreds
of lives a year in the City of Angels.
   A 1,000-officer task force flooded streets in gang areas Friday
night, and Police Chief Daryl Gates ordered the officers out again
Saturday night.
   Between Saturday evening and 1:30 a.m. Sunday, police reported
481 arrests, almost half of them on the gang-infested southside.
About 190 of the arrestees were suspected gang members, Officer Joe
Mariani said.
   At midevening Sunday, there were no reports of further mass
police action.
   Task force officers made 592 arrests Friday night and Saturday
morning during round one of the unprecedented crackdown on gangs
that have terrorized neighborhoods in the nation's second largest
city.
   About half of those arrested during the first dragnet were
believed to be gang members, police said.
   Officials said figures were not available on how many of those
arrested in the sweep, code-named ``Fly the Flag,'' had been
released by Sunday afternoon.
   It was the department's biggest attack ever on gangs, which
specialize in the cocaine trade and were blamed for 205 killings in
the city of Los Angeles last year. Gang killings in all of Los
Angeles County reached 387 last year.
   About half the special force, formed by putting officers on
overtime at a cost of $150,000 a day, went to augment regular
patrols in the south-central area, where gangs are the most active.
The rest of the officers spread out citywide.
   Two drive-by shootings were reported despite the police
presence, but investigators were not sure if they were gang-related.
   Late Saturday, a 16-year-old boy was wounded by shots fired from
a passing car. Hospital officials did not have a condition report
available Sunday. A dance hall security guard was killed by shots
fired from a car early Sunday, said Detective Richard Hoffman. A
man was detained in the shooting, he said.
   During his weekly radio address, Gov. George Deukmejian said
that when asked by police he will offer $10,000 rewards for
information leading to the arrest and conviction of wanted gang
members.
   The governor also said he will sponsor the reintroduction of
legislation to increase penalties for drive-by shootings and
teen-age killers.
   ``All too often, victims and witnesses of gang violence are
reluctant to provide authorities with information which could lead
to the arrest of these killers,'' Deukmejian said.
   While the task force was forming Saturday, tearful relatives
buried a 19-year-old man gunned down on a sidewalk by gang members
on Good Friday. Neither the dead man nor the 12 others injured in
the bloody attack were gang members, according to police and
relatives.
   ``This tragedy that has taken place, we should see that it
doesn't happen again by learning to love one another,'' said the
Rev. Lea Gibson.

   An opposition leader who led a rally
against Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega last month arrived as an exile
Sunday and predicted the Panamanian strongman would relinquish
power in a matter of days.
   Carlos Ernesto Gonzalez de la Lastra, 49, was freed Thursday
after being imprisoned for 10 days following his arrest on March
28, when police stopped the protest march he was leading in Panama
City.
   Gonzalez faced a long prison term on a sedition charge filed by
the government last summer if he did not accept exile.
   He said Sunday his arrest last month was ``totally illegal'' and
he had been beaten in prison by military officials.
   Gonzales said Noriega gave him the choice of remaining in jail
or going into exile.
   ``I accepted exile in order to mobilize Latin American public
opinion against the dictatorship under which Panama has lived for
the past two decades,'' he said.
   Gonzalez, carrying a Panamanian flag, arrived with his wife,
Vilma, from Panama City. He predicted Noriega's hold on Panama, as
chief of the country's Defense Forces, soon would end.
   ``General Manuel Noriega has power but he cannot exercise it
because the nation won't obey him. As a consequence of this
situation I consider that a change and a return to democracy and to
the rule of law are bound to come in the next few days,'' Gonzalez
said upon his arrival at Maiquetia International Airport outside
Caracas.
   ``The only thing that sustains him in power are military arms,''
Gonzalez said. ``The problem that afflicts us is internal and very
simple: We want freedom and democracy. Noriega is in the way.''
   Noriega has been indicted on narcotics trafficking charges in
the United States, and Washington has imposed economic sanctions
against Panama in an effort to force him to resign.
   Gonzalez was free on bond on the sedition charge when he was
arrested during the demonstration. He is is one of 35 directors of
the National Civic Crusade, a coalition of some 200 business,
labor, professional and political groups that has been seeking
Noriega's ouster since June.

   An oil painting said to be the work of
the late Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler was bought at action Saturday
for $18,442 by a Chilean-Venezuelan industrialist who said he
bought it as a gift for his wife.
   Juan Yanez Guzman, 38, outbid four other people at a Santiago
auction to obtain the signed, 15-inch by 19-inch painting entitled
``View of Waidhofen.'' According to auctioneers it was painted by
Hitler in Austria in about 1912.
   Yanez Guzman, a native of Chile and naturalized Venezuelan who
lives in Caracas, said he is not a collector of art nor of Nazi
memorabilia and only bought the painting because he thought his
wife might like it.
   His winning bid was 4.5 million Chilean pesos, equivalent to
$18,442.
   Juan Salinas, owner of the auction house, expressed
disappointment that the bidding did not go higher. ``This type of
thing sells much higher in Europe,'' he said in an interview after
the sale.
   Shortly after the sale, Salinas closed the auction house because
of a telephoned bomb threat. He said the threat might not have been
linked to the painting. ``I've got about three such calls before,''
he said.
   According to Salinas, the painting was bought to Chile by the
daughter of an aide to Hitler when she emigrated from Germany about
1950.

Saturday and injured 15 people before it collided with a car and
was killed, police reported.
   They said three of the injured were hospitalized.
   The police report said a 15-year-old girl was riding the horse
on an exercise area in Beverley, near Hull, when it threw her and
galloped wildly through the narrow streets crowded with shoppers
before it ran into a car.,
   Most of of the injured were treated and released but a

   The National People's Congress on Saturday named
as premier Li Peng, a cautious reformer whose foster father held
the post for 27 years, and gave its approval to a program to cut
bureaucracy.
   Li, 59, has been acting premier since November, when Zhao Ziyang
gave up the post to become Communist Party chief.
   On Sunday, members of an advisory body elected outgoing
president Li Xiannian to its largely ceremonial post of chairman.
   Li, 78, succeeds Deng Yingchao, the 84-year-old widow of Premier
Chou En-lai, as head of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference. Other past conference chairmen were Mao Tse-tung, Chou
and senior leader Deng Xiaoping.
   The former president, the only candidate, was elected by 1,839
members attending the final day of the conference's annual session,
held in conjunction with the National People's Congress.
   Li Peng was the only congress candidate for premier, but
delegates were told they could write in their own choice on the
ballots. There were no reports of how many did, if any.
   The premier is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the
government, while the party leader controls the direction of
government policies.
   Li is the adopted son of Chou, one of China's most beloved
Communist officials. A Moscow-educated technocrat, Li has
previously been vice premier and minister of education and industry.
   During the voting, delegates rushed to take pictures of each
other depositing the pink and orange ballots into large ballot
boxes set up throughout the main conference hall.
   One delegate voted against the reorganization of state
ministries and top-level commissions, which was approved by a show
of hands of the 2,877 delegates in the Great Hall of the People.
Two delegates abstained.
   A key part of the reorganization plan _ the merger of China's
railway and communications ministries and national airline _ was
abruptly dropped before the vote. Officials said some delegates had
objected to it, but gave no details.
   The delegates also cast ballots for vice chairmen of the state
Central Military Commission and top judicial posts.
   There was no sign of China's senior leader, the 84-year-old
Deng, who is a delegate and appeared at Friday's session. No
official explanation was given.
   Ninety-two ordinary delegates were also absent.
   The government permitted foreign reporters to watch the voting
from a balcony, but asked them to leave before the results were
announced.
   The congress on Friday elected Gen. Yang Shangkun president and
former Vice Premier Wan Li to head the congress Standing Committee.
   In five months as acting premier, Li Peng has indicated he
favors moving cautiously in introducing market-style economic
reforms. Zhao, in contrast, has emphasized quick implementation.
   In his speech to the congress when its session opened March 25,
Li strongly endorsed the reform goals of Deng and Zhao, but warned
against rushing ``headlong into mass action'' or being ``too
impatient for quick results.''
   In other voting, Zhao was elected vice chairman of the state
Central Military Commission under Deng as chairman. Yang Shangkun
stayed on as permanent vice chairman.
   Zhao has no military experience, and the post is seen as an
opportunity for him to gain the support in the military he will
need if he is to succeed Deng as China's top leader.
   Six members of the military commission also were elected,
including Qin Jiwei, head of the Beijing Military Command who is
expected to be named defense minister.
   Ren Jianxin, vice president of the Supreme People's Court, was
promoted to president, replacing Zheng Tianxiang.
   Liu Fuzhi, 71, a former minister of justice and minister of
public security, was elected the nation's top prosecutor.
   The government reorganization approved Saturday calls for
splitting several existing ministries and combining others,
reducing the total number from 45 to 41. Among the major changes,
the current planning and economic commissions will be merged into a
powerful body directing China's economic and social development
strategies.
   The cancellation of plans to merge the railways and Civil
Aviation Administration of China, the national flag carrier, came
as a suprise not only because of its abruptness but because te
Railways Ministry was regarded as a prime target of reform.
   The train system, China's main means of long-distance travel,
has failed to expand as quickly as demand, and has been criticized
for chronic mismanagement and sloppy operating procedures. Four
fatal train accidents this year, claiming a total of 168 lives,
created a clamor for improved safety measures.
   The congress is expected next week to approve ministerial
appointments and vote on several key laws, including one that would
guarantee business people more freedom from government interference.
   It also is expected to approve a constitutional amendment
legitimizing China's small but growing private sector.

   The wreckage of a Canadian
fighter jet that disappeared while searching for a fishing boat was
found Saturday in a heavily wooded area on northern Vancouver
Island.
   The pilot of the CF-18 fighter, 27-year-old Capt. Michael
Erickson of Delta, did not survive the Tuesday crash, said Maj.
Robin Alford of the Rescue Coordination Center in Victoria.
   The body had not been recovered by late Saturday.
   Alford said the plane was discovered Saturday afternoon by a
search and rescue aircraft. The jet had crashed in a heavily wooded
area of Brooks Peninsula off the northwest coast of Vancouver
Island.
   It had been searching for a fishing boat that had been reported
missing in the area. The boat later returned to port.
   Alford said a military board of investigation was to be flown to
the site Sunday.

   President Robert Mugabe's governing
party decided Saturday to merge with former opposition leader
Joshua Nkomo's party in a further move to establish a one-party
socialist state.
   More than 3,000 Zimbabwe African National Union (Patriotic
Front) delegates voted at the one-day congress to approve a unity
accord singed by Nkomo and Mugabe on Dec. 22.
   They agreed to bring both parties under the governing party
banner and create a one-party socialist state in of Africa's few
Western-style democracies.
   ``The entire nation is certainly rejoicing with us today,''
Mugabe said after the vote.
   Members of Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union voted
overwhelmingly April 2 to dissolve the country's oldest political
movement and merge. Nkomo's congress also gave support for a
one-party socialist state.
   Mugabe and other officials of Nkomo's party quit that party in
1963, vowing to begin a violent struggle for black majority rule in
what was the white-governed British colony of Rhodesia.
   Nkomo, 70, and Mugabe, 64, were detained for over a decade
without charge as terrorists. Thousands of their supporters fled
the country to become guerrillas in their two rival armies during
the 7-year-old war that led to independence as black-governed
Zimbabwe on April 18, 1980.
   The two parties had engaged in frequent faction fighting before
the unity agreement.

   The hijackers of a Kuwaiti jumbo jet with
53 people aboard threw the body of one captive from the plane
Saturday and threatened to kill more unless the plane was refueled,
government officials said.
   The hijackers later freed a sick passenger, the 58th person
released from the 112 who were aboard when the plane was seized
Tuesday. There are believed to be at least six hijackers.
   In a statement Sunday, the hijackers threatened ``a slow and
quiet massacre'' if their demands for refueling and the release of
17 terrorists from Kuwait were not met. One of the hijackers
radioed that they plan to take the jet to Kuwait, according to
airport officials.
   ``And if Kuwait refuses us, a crash landing will take place on
the ... prince's palace,'' one hijacker radioed the control tower,
referring to the ruling emir of the oil-rich state.
   The hijacker said the jet must be refueled Sunday.
   A senior Palestine Liberation Organization official met four
times with the hijackers Saturday, raising hopes of a breakthrough
in the deadlocked negotiations.
   The Kuwait Airways Boeing 747 was hijacked on a flight from
Bangkok to Kuwait and forced to land in Mashhad in northeastern
Iran, where 57 people were released. It left Iran Friday and landed
in Larnaca after being refused permission to land in Lebanon and
Syria.
   Cypriot officials identified the slain man as a security guard
on the airliner, but the Kuwait News Agency said the victim was one
of three military men returning from a vacation in Thailand.
   The agency quoted unidentified officials as saying the released
man is a 32-year-old Kuwaiti Shiite Moslem named Fadel
Abdel-Rassoul Leeri. A Kuwaiti of that name was listed as a
passenger.
   Cypriot government spokesman Akis Fantis said the man's release
``was a sign of goodwill by the hijackers.''
   Soon after his release, officials at the airport near Larnaca
said the hijackers radioed the tower with an English statement
reiterating their demand that Kuwait free 17 pro-Iran terrorists,
all but one a Shiite Moslem, convicted there for a chain of
bombings in 1983.
   The remaining passengers are believed to be Arabs, including
three members of Kuwait's extensive royal family.
   Cypriot officials said negotiations between the hijackers and
the Kuwaitis had stalemated Saturday, with ``the hijackers
demanding fuel so they can leave and the Kuwaitis insisting this
must not happen.''
   But about three hours after the killing, the PLO's deputy
director in Cyprus, Malaz Abdo, and two Cypriot officials were
driven to the plane, parked at the eastern end of the beachside
runway. They held a series of talks with the hijackers, but no
details of the negotiations were released.
   Cyprus Television reported that the hijackers first proposed
releasing five passengers in exchange for fuel and the aircraft's
departure, then proposed releasing half the passengers for about
half the 17 terrorists held in Kuwait.
   It said the hijackers later offered to release half the
passengers in exchange for the three terrorists facing death
sentences in Kuwait, with the remaining passengers to be freed when
the release of the terrorists was confirmed. Cypriot authorities,
at the insistence of Kuwaiti officials, rejected the proposals,
according to the television report.
   In London, the Sunday Telegraph quoted military sources as
saying a 35-member special British military unit was flown to
Cyprus Friday night to support a possible Cypriot-led rescue
mission. London's Sunday Express reported Britain flew in special
surveillance equipment to monitor activity aboard the jet.
   Britian's Foreign Office only would say it was in touch with
authorities in Cyprus, and Cypriot officials stressed that the
government has not requested British military assistance.
   At a news conference in Moscow, PLO chief Yasser Arafat said he
would try to help resolve the crisis at the request of Kuwait. But
he added: ``The policy of the PLO is completely against these kinds
of events. No Palestinian has been involved in this.''
   The PLO is fighting for a Palestinian homeland in the Middle
East.
   Saturday's slaying, the first in the five-day ordeal, came two
minutes after a deadline set by the hijackers for the Cypriots to
provide fuel.
   The man's body, his hands tied, was tossed out of the airplane
door onto the tarmac. An ambulance drove to the plane, medics put
the body on a stretcher, and it drove away.
   A government spokesman said the man was shot three times in the
head and had a broken neck. It was not clear if the neck injury
resulted from the fall.
   The shooting came a few hours after the pilot reported that the
hijackers began beating passengers because the Cypriots had not
given them fuel.
   The hijackers told the Larnaca tower earlier Saturday that six
of their captives aboard were sick. They did not elaborate.
   It was not known exactly how many hijackers there are.
   A Palestinian stewardess released by the hijackers said Saturday
she thinks there were seven air pirates, all with blond hair and
fair skin and speaking Arabic with a Lebanese accent. Commenting at
Cairo International Airport, she said each hijacker was armed with
a pistol, and the apparent leader had at least one hand grenade.
   He threatened to blow up the airplane if anyone resisted, she
said.
   Passengers released in Iran Tuesday and Wednesday told officials
in Kuwait there were as many as 10.
   The identities and nationalities of the hijackers are not known.

an ammunition depot Sunday and sent rockets showering into two
Pakistani cities, killing at least 57 people and injuring 768,
officials said.
   The official news agency, APP, said one of the dead was a member
of Parliament, Khaqan Abbasi. It said he was killed when a rocket
hit his car.
   No foreigners were reported among the casualties.
   The Defense Ministry said the explosions started after fire
broke out at the depot between the capital, Islamabad, and the
nearby city of Rawalpindi. About 5 million people live in the two
cities.
   It was not immediately known what caused the fire, and there was
no damage estimate. Casualty figures came from local hospitals.
   The initial blast sent a sheet of flame 500 feet into the air.
Rockets began screaming over Rawalpindi and the western and
southern sections of the capital, where most Pakistani federal
employees live.
   One missile exploded just outside the wall of the U.S. Embassy
compound but there was no damage, witnesses said.
   The explosion of heavy ammunition lasted about 35 minutes,
during which people ran fleeing from office buildings and converged
on schools to find their children. Some rockets struck cars and
buildings.
   Doctors at three area hospitals said many of those admitted had
shrapnel wounds and burns.
   The ammunition depot continued to burn more than five hours
after the initial blast and bush fires roared several miles from
the depot.
   Police were deployed in heavy numbers around the city to direct
traffic away from the blast areas and to protect foreign embassies.
   Craters from the explosions, some still smoldering, could be
seen along the airport road leading south from Islamabad. Defense
Ministry officials said some projectiles crashed six miles from the
depot.
   One unexploded missile lay embedded in the sidewalk by the
children's ward of the National Medical Institute.
   Officials appealed for blood donors, and President Mohammed Zia
ul-Haq said the government would do all it can to help the injured,
APP reported.
   The agency said the president issued a statement from Kuwait,
where he was to attend a meeting of the Organization of Islamic
Conference. The statement expressed sympathy for the victims and
their families.

   Hijackers of a Kuwaiti jetliner ``started
to hurt'' passengers Sunday after their demands for more fuel and
freedom for pro-Iranian extremists jailed in Kuwait were not met,
according to a message from the cockpit.
   Earlier, the hijackers threatened a ``slow and quiet massacre''
of the hostages, but a noon deadline passed without incident.
   Then, one minute before a second afternoon deadline expired,
someone in the cockpit told the Larnaca Airport control tower,
``They've already started to hurt on the passengers.'' The speaker
was believed to be the flight engineer.
   Two hooded gunmen had ripped the inflatable escape chutes out of
the plane and threw them onto the tarmac, then demanded that
workers remove them from the runway to clear a path for the plane.
   At 3 p.m., the flight engineer told the airport tower: ``The
hijackers are dictating this message. If they don't get a positive
response in one hour and 15 minutes regarding fuel and services,
they will start hurting occupants of the aircraft.''
   The engineer said an unspecified number of passengers were
``sick,'' but when the control tower asked that they be released, a
voice came on the radio and said, ``negative.''
   Earlier, the hijackers said they would force the pilot to take
off and crash into the Kuwaiti royal palace. There were believed to
be 53 people still on board the Kuwait Airways Boeing 747,
including three members of Kuwait's royal family and about six
hijackers.
   The latest threats came after a sixth round of talks between the
gunmen and PLO officials from Cyprus. There was no word on what was
said at the plane.
   During the 6-day-old ordeal, at least one hostage has been
killed _ a 24-year-old Kuwaiti man whose body was tossed onto the
tarmac Saturday. He was shot after authorities refused hijackers'
demands for more fuel.
   Cyprus government spokesman Akis Fantis said Sunday that marks
on the slain passenger's body indicated he was severely beaten
during the 18 to 24 hours before his death.
   In a morning statement, one of the hijackers told the control
tower, ```We hereby re-announce our refueling request due to our
intention to (go to) Kuwait, the concerned country. And if Kuwait
refuses us, a crash landing will take place on the ... prince's
palace.''
   He asked the Cypriot government to accede to his requests,
``preventing the slow and quiet massacre taking place in this
country. We perform (carry out) our sayings very accurately, and we
have been forced to send a sample yesterday.''
   State-run Cyprus radio said the government and the Palestine
Liberation Organization appealed to the gunmen not to carry out
their threat.
   One of the hijackers said they would release the hostages
``immediately'' if the 17 pro-Iranian extremists, convicted in
Kuwait in the 1983 bombings of the U.S. and French embassies there,
were freed. Kuwait has refused the demand.
   Flight 422 landed in Larnaca on Friday. It was commandeered
Tuesday en route to Kuwait from Bangkok with 112 people aboard and
forced to land in Mashhad in northeastern Iran, where 57 people
were released. The jet left Iran and landed in Larnaca after being
refused permission to land in Lebanon and Syria. Another captive
was freed in Larnaca.
   Larnaca airport officials said the airport at San`a in North
Yemen was closed to traffic after unconfirmed reports that the
gunmen wanted to fly there.
   The director of San`a international airport, Mohammed al-Faqeeh,
acknowledged that the facility was closed but said it was because
of bad weather.
   In reply to queries by The Associated Press, al-Faqeeh also
said, ``Anyway our airport is not equipped to receive such a huge
aircraft, and it would crash if it tried to land here.''

<HEAD>Seto Ohashi Bridge Opens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Seto Ohashi bridge opened Sunday to rail and
vehicle traffic, linking Japan's four main islands by bridge and
tunnel for the first time.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita called the long-awaited opening
of the 7.86-mile bridge a proud achievement.
   Because support columns for the bridge sit on five small islands
it is difficult to compare the Seto Ohashi with other bridges. The
Guiness Book of records says the longest railway bridge in the
world is Huey P. Long Bridge in Metairie, La. The railroad section
is 4.35 miles long.
   The double-deck bridge straddles a chain of five small islands
in the Inland Sea and extends 5.6 miles over water to link the main
Japanese island of Honshu with Shikoku island to the south.
   The bridge consists of three main suspensions, the longest of
which is the 1,210-yard central span that is 198 yards shorter than
the central span of San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge.
   Last Tuesday, the Seto Ohashi was made a sister bridge to that
Californian symbol.
   The Seto Ohashi cost $9 billion and took 10 years to build.
   Yasutoshi Kunisue, spokesman of the government-owned
Honshu-Shikoku Bridge Authority, said about 60 trains and 25,000
cars were expected to cross the bridge daily.
   Kunisue said the minimum toll for passenger cars of $44 each way
would enable authorities to recover the cost of the bridge in 30
years.
   Takeshita told about 800 officials at the opening ceremony that
``we can proud of this achievement for future genrations.''
   Honshu was connected with the northernmost main island of
Hokkaido last month when the 34.6-mile Seikan undersea tunnel
opened. Another undersea tunnel has connected Honshu with the
southernmost main island of Kyushu since 1942.
   Kyodo News Service reported that 2,500 people lined up at
Takamatsu Railway Station in Shikoku early Sunday for the first
ride across the span, but only about 900 were able to get on the
train.
   Before the bridge opened Sunday, about 1,000 people each day
used boats to cross between the two islands. The crossing took
about an hour.

<HEAD>Students Hold Sit-In To Demand Education Money</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eighteen university students and a teacher held a
brief sit-in Sunday in Tiananmen Square to demand more money for
education and better living standards for intellectuals.
   A Western reporter who witnessed the sit-in at the capital's
center said several dozen uniformed police politely asked
passers-by to give room to the protesters and said they had the
right to express their view.
   The reporter said the protesters ``were just sitting there
quietly with a small sign in (Chinese) and English saying, `We want
more money for education.'''
   The sit-in began at about 1 p.m. and ended about 2:30 p.m. when
the group apparently left on its own, he said. It attracted only a
small crowd in the huge square, jammed with Chinese enjoying the
warm weather and flying kites.
   The protest capped a week of complaints from students that the
government is not investing enough money in education.
   Both the non-political tone of the protests and the mild
official response is in sharp contrast to the nationwide student
protests in the winter of 1986-87, when students issued sweeping
calls for democracy and the state responded by jailing student
leaders.
   In a rare report of dissent in China, the official Xinhua News
Agency mentioned the student sit-in but specified that the demands
were in line with comments made in the past two weeks by delegates
to the National People's Congress and Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference.
   The National People's Congress, China's legislature, and the
consultative conference, an advisory body, are holding their annual
sessions in Beijing.
   Delegates at both have stressed the need for more attention to
education and for higher salaries for teachers and other
intellectuals, who generally are paid less than factory workers.
   Xinhua said the sit-in participants came from Beijing
University, Qinghua University and Beijing Teachers' University.
   The Xinhua report quoted officials as saying funds for education
would increase 12.2 percent this year over last and that the state
had ``made a big effort'' to budget money for education ``at a time
when the country has many financial difficulties.''
   The 1988 budget report to the National People's Congress said
the state would spend $12 billion on education, culture, science
and public health, but did not give a separate education figure.
Spending for the four areas would amount to 17 percent of the total
$71.2 billion budget.

<TEXT>
   KATUTURA, South-West Africa (AP) _ Archbishop Desmond Tutu
preached Sunday in the territory's largest black township, derided
its multiracial government and renewed his call for independence
from South Africa.
   Tutu gave his sermon to about 1,500 people, many in the red,
green and blue colors of the South-West Africa People's
Organization, a guerrilla group fighting for independence.
   The congregation had gathered to hear Tutu, the first black
leader of the Anglican church in southern Africa, in a church near
Windhoek, capital of the territory commonly known as Namibia.
   ``God is here with you in Namibia. He suffers with you,'' said
Tutu. ``He says, `It is going to be all right, because I am the God
of justice, I am the God of liberation.'''
   Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, lamented last week's
moves by South African President P.W. Botha to broaden power of his
country's chief representative in Namibia.
   Botha said Administrator-General Louis Pienaar will be empowered
to act against ``subversive'' media, arrange for regional or
racially based elections and refer certain major court rulings to
South Africa's appellate court.
   The archbishop spurned the territory's multiracial interim
government as ``echoes of their master's voice.''
   He was joined at the church Sunday by 18 Anglican bishops who
serve under him. They included the bishop of Namibia, who wore a
leopard-skin mitre, and bishops from nearby Swaziland, Lesotho and
neighboring South Africa.
   Women ululated and held their children above their heads for a
glimpse of Tutu. The service was held at a Roman Catholic church,
the largest place of worship in the township of 60,000 people.
   Namibia's 1.3 million people are 88 percent black. The rest are
divided about equally between whites, who dominate the economy, and
people of mixed race.
   The rebels in the territory have waged a 22-year-old, largely
ineffectual war of independence.
   On Sunday, Tutu blamed South Africa's apartheid system for the
violence.
   Tutu won his Nobel prize for his fight against apartheid, which
establishes a racially segregated society in which South Africa's
26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools
and health services.
   ``We are opposed to all violence, especially the violence of the
evil system of apartheid, however it may be disguised by cosmetic
adjustments,'' Tutu said Sunday. ``It can survive only because it
uses evil and immoral methods to defend it.''
   A sheet of hymns distributed at the church Sunday showed
pictures of detained activists.
   But Tutu said he opposed violence by both guerrillas and the
military, and he rejected communism as a goal for Namibia.
   ``The best defense against communism is a free and contented
people,'' he said. ``South Africa does not want Namibia to be
free.''
   Tutu appealed for Pretoria to observe a U.N. resolution calling
for a South African withdrawal and U.N.-supervised independence
elections in Namibia.
   But South Africa says it will stay as long as Cuban troops
remain in neighboring Angola, where they are helping the Marxist
government battle combined forces of South Africa and a rebel
movement.

<TEXT>
   China's outgoing president Li Xiannian on Sunday
was elected chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, an advisory body that functions much like a council of
elders.
   Li, 78, succeeds Deng Yingchao, the 84-year-old widow of Premier
Chou En-lai. Other former chairmen are Mao Tse-tung, Chou and
current senior leader Deng Xiaoping.
   Li, the only candidate, was elected by the 1,839 members
attending the final day of the body's annual session.
   The conference holds its plenary session parallel with the
National People's Congress, China's legislature. On Friday, the
National People's Congress named Yang Shangkun, 81, a general with
close ties to senior leader Deng, to succeed Li as president.
   Li is believed to be in frail health and, as head of the largely
powerless advisory body, he will be freed from demanding government
duties while being honored for his long years of service.
   Li was less enthusiastic about economic reforms than Deng or
Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang. The appointment of Yang to
replace him is regarded as further aiding Zhao's push to open China
to the West.
   Li has spent more than six decades fighting for the Chinese
revolution.
   As a teen-ager he led a peasant uprising against local
landlords, and in 1927 he joined Mao Tse-tung's Communist forces.
   He was a veteran of the ``Long March,'' the Red Army's 1934-35
epic escape from Nationalist troops, and later commanded 60,000
soldiers as they fought invading Japanese forces.
   After the Communist takeover in 1949, he held posts in his
native Hubei province before being named vice premier and finance
minister in 1954. He remained finance minister for the next 25
years. During the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution he was criticized,
but, unlike most of China's leaders today, escaped being purged or
persecuted.
   He was named China's president in 1983.
   The consultative conference is made up mainly of intellectuals
and members of approved non-Communist parties. Its main function is
to offer advice to the party and the legislature on various
scientific, economic and social issues.
   In a closing speech, Li urged that the conference be given a
larger role in formulating government policies and that people ``in
all walks of life'' be encouraged to air their views frankly.
   He also urged Taiwan's anti-Communist Nationalist government to
take steps toward reuniting the island with mainland China.
   The Nationalists set up a rival government on Taiwan, a province
of China, in 1949 after being defeated by the Communists in a civil
war.
   Taiwan began last year to allow its residents to visit the
mainland for the first time since 1949, but still refuses to
discuss reunification.
   In addition to Li, the consulative conference also elected 28
vice chairmen. Of the 28, 12 are aged 80 or above.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years of silence and anti-Semitism,
Poland is re-evaluating its relationship to the Jews, once the
country's largest minority and now mostly a memory in abandoned
synagogues and forsaken graveyards.
   On April 14, Poles will begin a weeklong observance of the 45th
anniversary of the heroic rising of Warsaw Jews against the Nazi
occupiers.
   The commemoration, which will bring the largest delegation ever
from Israel, follows a rare public self-criticism issued last month
by Poland's communist party about anti-Semitic purges 20 years ago.
   Both the Warsaw anniversary and the party's self-criticism have
rekindled a simmering debate about whether Jews and Poles, who
lived side by side for most of Poland's 1,000 years of recorded
history, will ever be able to repair their sundered relationship.
   Poland once was known for its tolerant attitude to the Jews.
   From the Middle Ages to the 19th century, it guaranteed Jews
legal privileges and limited self-government. The Polish king was
regularly prayed for in synagogues around the world.
   By the beginning of World War II, Poland's 3.5 million Jews
comprised 10 percent of the population, the backbone of its middle
class. About 40 percent of Warsaw was Jewish.
   But as a result of the Nazi Holocaust and subsequent waves of
emigration, the number of Jews living in Poland today has fallen to
about 10,000 out of a population of 37.5 million.
   A visit to Warsaw's only synagogue on a Saturday morning shows
just 40 worshipers, mostly elderly men. There are no rabbis in
Poland.
   The 45th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising _ the
monthlong resistance to the Nazi drive to liquidate the ghetto's
last 70,000 inhabitants _is being treated by the government as an
opportunity to honor Polish Jews and stress the mutual suffering of
Poles and Jews under the Nazis.
   But the official apology for the 1968 purges is a reminder of
the persistent strains of anti-Semitism that have marred
Polish-Jewish relations through the centuries.
   In March, Trybuna Ludu, the official newspaper of the Polish
United Workers (communist) Party, for the first time acknowledged
that anti-Semitism was a decisive factor in the 1968 purge and that
innocent people were harmed.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban, himself of Jewish descent,
said in an interview after the party statement that anti-Semitism
no longer exists in public life and among the younger generation
``it is practically nonexistent.''
   But Warsaw psychologist Kostek Gebert, a member of a budding
movement of Jews who in recent years have returned to their
ancestors' faith, said the official view is too rosy.
   ``Polish culture, the Polish identity is permeated with
anti-Semitism and I can't see any imaginable way of this fact being
corrected,'' Gebert said.
   ``The point is that in Poland a respectable person can be
anti-Semitic,'' he said. In other countries, he said, anti-Semitism
is like syphilis. ``You can have it but a gentleman doesn't show it
off.''
   During World War II, nearly 3 million Polish Jews were killed by
the Nazis. The death camps of Auschwitz-Birkenau, Treblinka,
Majdanek, Belzec, Chelmo and Sobibor were all on what is now Polish
territory.
   But although Poland was the site of much of the killing, most
Poles bridle at the view, common outside Poland and reflected in
the French documentary film ``Shoah,'' that Poles to some degree
were accomplices in the Holocaust.
   The dominant viewpoint here is that both Poles and Jews were
victims of the Nazis, and that Poles did what was within their
power to thwart the tragedy.
   Indeed, of the gentiles honored by Israel as Righteous Among
Nations for assisting Jews during the war, 1,700 were Poles, more
than in other country. And it was the Polish underground that
smuggled evidence of the existence of the death camps to London
during the war.
   But for all the examples of Poles coming to the aid of Jews,
examples can be found in recent history of Polish cruelty to Jews.
   Europe's last pogrom claimed dozens of Jewish lives in the
southern Polish city of Kielce in 1946. The 1968 purges forced
13,000 Jews from the country. During the 1980-81 Solidarity labor
upheaval, anti-Semitic charges were leveled against union activists.
   Nevertheless, there are signs that Poland is trying to put away
its anti-Semitic legacy.
   For the April 19 anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, the
government is creating a memorial route.
   The government is also sprucing up Jewish monuments and
cemeteries around the country and establishing a kosher kitchen for
the 4,500 foreign visitors, principally from Israel and the United
States, expected for the Warsaw anniversary.
   Reflecting a desire to clarify attitudes about Jews in Polish
history, about 100 Polish scholars attended a meeting of historians
in Jerusalem in early February on the Holocaust.
   ``The Polish side ... presented the view that we had not done
enough and that we must admit that we are guilty of at least the
sin of indifference towards those who had been condemned,'' said
historian Krystyna Kersten, describing the conference in the
underground newspaper Tygodnik Mazowsze.

   A Washington lawyer's legal battles
for the Sandinista government have garnered him a place in
Nicaragua's history: his signature on the cease-fire plan to end
its bloody 6-year-old civil war.
   Paul Reichler called the March 23 agreement between the
government and Contra rebels a ``dream come true,'' and he is
certain it will meet its goal.
   ``It's going to lead to a permanent and lasting peace in
Nicaragua and further democratization of the country,'' he said in
a weekend interview.
   Reichler's involvement with the peace process started last
December when he negotiated for the leftist government in indirect
talks with the U.S.-supported Contra rebels.
   The talks complied with the regional peace plan signed last
August by the presidents of Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala,
Costa Rica and Honduras.
   President Daniel Ortega later named Reichler, a 40-year-old
Harvard graduate, to help represent the government in unprecedented
face-to-face talks with the Contras.
   Reichler said that by March 23, the third day of the talks at
the southern border town of Sapoa, it became obvious an agreement
would be reached to end the war that has killed more than 40,000
people.
   ``The magic hit. We were all caught up in this whirlwind of
history,'' he said. ``It was like we were being propelled forward
by a force.''
   Just before midnight on March 23 the armistice was read. Ortega
and the Sandinista delegation shared a makeshift platform with
Contra leaders, and they sang the national anthem.
   ``You had to be a mannequin not to have chills,'' Reichler
recalled. ``It was the kind of thing I dreamed about.''
   He said he did not know that his name would be on the final
document, and the event was something that choked him up.
   ``I tried to keep a cool head and keep emotions out of it for
three days. And I did. But I actually had a hard time writing my
name. I had trouble controlling my hand.''
   He said he hoped his signature was something his 3-year-old
adopted daughter, Jessica Danielle, would treasure. She is
Nicaraguan and named in honor of the president.
   After the solemn public ceremony, the two sides met behind
closed doors to share congratulations and drinks, Reichler said.
   ``I remember embracing (Contra leader) Alfredo Cesar,'' he said.
``And if the scene of the stage was dreamlike, the scene inside _
drinking and toasting _ was beyond dreams.''
   Reichler started working as a lawyer for the Sandinistas shortly
after they came to power in a 1979 revolutionary war. He spent his
early months trying to recover assets from ousted President
Anastasio Somoza.
   Reichler argued and won a landmark decision before the
International Court of Justice in 1986 for the Sandinistas. The
world court, whose decisions are non-binding, found the United
States guilty of violating international law by waging war on
Nicaragua.
   He called the decision ``extremely gratifying'' but was
frustrated that it did not stop the war.
   Reichler said the Sandinistas are not totalitarians seeking to
export a communist revolution, as the Reagan administration
maintains.
   ``President Reagan does not know Daniel Ortega. I do,'' Reichler
said.
   ``I have never heard Marxist-Leninist rhetoric from them. They
are principled, principles not rooted in any ideology. They want
social justice.''
   Asked if he could have been duped by the Sandinistas, Reichler
responded: ``I have no doubt in my mind that, one, they are
prepared to have a democratic system in Nicaragua, and that they
not only want normal but friendly relations with the United
States.''

<HEAD>Congress Eyes Quick Citizenship for Tennis Star</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supporters of tennis star Ivan Lendl will try
to convince Congress this month to expedite U.S. citizenship for
the native of Czechoslovakia so he can represent his adopted
homeland in the Summer Olympics and other international competition.
   Congressional aides say chances for lifting the mandatory,
five-year waiting period for Lendl are slim despite the tennis
player's personal lobbying effort, including discussions with Vice
President George Bush and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   But supporters say a special bill for a 21-year-old,
Canadian-born swimmer now living in Texas, which was pushed through
Congress recently by two Texas Democrats, House Speaker Jim Wright
and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, opens the door for Lendl, who lives in
Greenwich, Conn.
   Both Kennedy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary immigration
subcommittee, and his House counterpart, Rep. Romano L. Mazzoli,
D-Ky., routinely oppose private bills giving special treatment to
Olympic athletes seeking U.S. citizenship.
   ``If you start down the slippery slope of granting what most
Americans would say is a great right ... and start making it
available on demand, I think you've eroded a terribly important
right and obligation and cherished thing under our law,'' said
Jerry Tinker, a top aide on Kennedy's subcommittee.
   The House subcommittee issued a rule last year warning lawmakers
against filing a plethora of Olympic-tied immigration bills, saying
that the bills are an ``extraordinary remedy'' available only to
aliens with ``extreme hardship.''
   But Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, D-Conn., who has taken up the Lendl
bill following the death of Rep. Stewart B. McKinney, R-Conn., said
the door to athletic exemptions has been opened by legislation for
Tracey McFarlane, a University of Texas swimmer.
   ``I took the position that I would not ask the subcommittee to
break the rule it established,'' said Morrison, a member of the
panel. ``But fair is fair. We've already made an exception on
behalf of someone sponsored by the speaker ... Ivan Lendl's case is
at least as meritorious and ought to receive equal treatment.''
   The McFarlane bill has passed the House and Senate and is
expected to be signed by the president soon, a Bentsen aide said.
Like Lendl, Miss McFarlane has obtained her permanent-resident
status but has not completed the five-year waiting period required
for citizenship.
   After sending letters to the authors of several Olympic-tied
immigration bills earlier this year indicating the measures had no
chance, Mazzoli scheduled a hearing April 20 on the Lendl measure
and ones for several other potential Olympians. Lendl is not
expected to attend the hearing, since, under the panel's rules, he
cannot testify for himself.
   ``If you start doing it for (athletes), why not do it for
artistic ability or for people who are nuclear physicists?'' Tinker
asked. Immigration exemptions, he said, are ``for people who are
literally falling through the cracks; some urgent humanitarian,
family or other compelling reason. If we start doing it for
personal convenience, we'd be swamped.''
   But ``a professional tennis player's playing lifespan is
short,'' countered Kim Elliott, an aide to Sen. Lowell P. Weicker
Jr., R-Conn. ``He said he'd like to wear the U.S. colors while he's
still at the peak instead of the end of his career.'' Tennis will
be an Olympic event for the first time this September in Seoul.
   Morrison argued that the legislation would benefit the United
States more than Lendl.
   ``Ivan Lendl doesn't need this. He's very successful. This isn't
going to change his living circumstances or his tax status or his
income in any way,'' Morrison said. ``While this is a personal
benefit to him, it is actually a greater benefit to the United
States and the promotion of tennis in the Olympics.''
   Lendl, however, is not expected to be at the hearing, said his
attorney, William Bricker of New York. Under subcommittee rules, he
cannot testify on his own behalf.
   Several other private immigration bills are expected to be
discussed at the hearing, including the case of Dan Iuga, coach of
the U.S. Olympic pistol team who defected from Romania and is
living in Colorado, and Jens-Peter Burntd, an East German swimmer
who defected in 1985 and is living in Alabama.

   It was bad enough when they convicted
Kermit's police chief for selling drugs and the fire chief for
setting fires, along with other members of their clan. Then the
former county sheriff admitted he sold his job to the highest
bidder.
   And last week, a special grand jury returned indictments
charging 16 of Mingo County's most prominent politicians _
including state legislators, a prosecutor and the mayor of the
county seat _ with bribery and conspiracy to subvert free elections
in Mingo County.
   The grand jury, one of three convened as part of a special state
and federal task force investigating corruption in the county, is
not yet finished. Circuit Judge Dan O'Hanlon, brought in from
another county, says the grand jury will remain empaneled through
July and will be in session on Election Day to hear any complaints
of vote fraud.
   In all, some 60 people from Mingo County have been convicted on
state or federal charges in the past two years. The investigations
started separately, with the federal government breaking a drug and
arson ring that operated openly in the tiny town of Kermit. At the
other end of the county, the state tackled allegations of vote
fraud in Gilbert's municipal elections.
   Investigators started bumping into one another. The deeper they
looked, the more pervasive the corruption seemed. Mingo County's
elections became the joke of the day in West Virginia: ``What do
you call a voter in Mingo County? An unindicted co-conspirator.''
   Other West Virginians have long liked to poke fun at Mingo
County, which dubs itself ``The Heart of the Billion-Dollar
Coalfield.'' Far from being central to the state, however, its
location on the southwestern border with Kentucky is isolated, deep
in the heart of Appalachia. And although mining has scarred the
landscape, it remains a land of narrow, winding valleys separated
by steep wooded ridges.
   The isolation has had its darker side, and the region was known
for years as ``bloody Mingo.'' It first hit newspaper front pages
in the 19th century, when the Hatfield clan feuded in pitched
battles with the McCoy clan from across the border in Kentucky.
   These days the boom and bust cycles of the coalfield economy
still dominate most lives in Mingo, and the economy has been bust
since the early 1980s.
   The area's poverty and isolation allowed corruption to flourish,
according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Savage, who heads the
federal side of the investigation.
   Savage points out that of the county's 36,000 residents, only
8,700 have jobs. And of those 8,700 jobs, he says, more than 2,600
are controlled by politicians _ the school board, the county
commission, the anti-poverty agencies. As a result, he says, many
people feel they must vote the way they're told by the politicians
who control their livelihood.
   ``You can't assess fault on the people of Mingo County,'' says
Savage. ``People anywhere could find themselves in this situation
if conditions were right.''
   The linchpin to the latest indictments was Johnie Owens, a
former county Democratic chairman and one-time sheriff. He said he
accepted a $20,000 downpayment on a $100,000 bribe from the current
sheriff, Charles E. ``Eddie'' Hilbert, then persuaded the three
county commissioners to accept his resignation and appoint Hilbert
in exchange for half the bribe.
   Those county commissioners, one of whom is now a state senator,
were among those indicted last week. The grand jury also accused 15
politicians of conspiring with Owens, as Democratic chairman, to
improperly influence elections and buy votes.
   Hilbert is scheduled to enter a plea in federal court April 18.
He was indicted in January on 13 counts, including allegations that
he protected the drug and arson ring in Kermit in exchange for
illegal campaign contributions.
   That ring showed that while the days of the Hatfields and McCoys
are long over, clans still play a role in the region.
   Among those from Kermit who were sentenced to lengthy prison
terms were Fire Chief Wilburn ``Wig'' Preece, his wife, six of
their 14 children and their son-in-law, Police Chief David Ramey.

<HEAD>East Germany Blasts Parody Of Its Party Daily</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The East German Communist Party is not laughing
about a parody of its official paper that was smuggled in from West
Germany and reported plans to turn police archives into a public
library.
   In a commentary Saturday, Neues Deutschland, the target of the
parody, accused a Hamburg magazine of ``gross intrusion'' in the
country's internal affairs.
   The magazine ``Tempo'' late last week admitted that it had
printed 6,000 copies of the parody edition and smuggled them into
East Germany. The newspapers were distributed in East Berlin and
Leipzig.
   Saturday's commentary carried the headline ``Wretched Forgers''
and accused the authors of criminal misuse of press freedom.
   The articles in the parody were written by East German
dissidents now living in West Germany, Tempo said.
   Neues Deutschland said the contents of the articles were so
``unspeakably primitive'' that they did not deserve a detailed
response.
   One of the articles carried a headline with a play on words
referring to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's notion of glasnost,
or openness on selected topics. It proclaimed: ``New `Clear As
Glass' Course Wins the Hearts of the Masses.''
   Gorbachev's glasnost proposals have been greeted nervously by
leaders in East Germany, one of the Warsaw Pact's most
tightly-controlled societies.
   Another article reported on suggestions for the sale of the
fortified and heavily-guarded wall that partitions Berlin into East
Germany and West Germany.
   Other articles reported on the dismantling of nuclear power
plants in East Germany, proposals to send unemployed West Germans
to East Germany and on the conversion of the state secret police
archive into a public reading room.
   In a glowing review of a fictitious new model of the East
German-made Trabant automobile, a writer gushed that the new
``turbo-charged luxury Trabbi'' now sported a sought-after product,
a round steering wheel.
   The East German Trabant is a compact car equipped with few
extras.

   The tunes may be different, but the
harmonies will be the same when barbershop singing groups gather
Monday around the world to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the
organization that promotes them.
   The Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber
Shop Quartet Singing in America, or the SPEBSQUA, has about 38,000
members in 825 chapters.
   But Ray Heller, the organization's manager of communications,
says that because that name does not spring as easily from the lips
as does the music its members sing, it is known informally as the
the Barber Shop Harmony Society.
   Each chapter is to gather Monday at 10 p.m. and sing a few songs
to commemorate the anniversary.
   The group, despite its formal name, promotes four-part harmony
among choruses, ranging in size from 20 to 150 people, as well as
among the traditional quartet.
   ``It is more demanding to participate in a quartet, and some
people who like four-part harmony get a boot out of singing in
larger groups instead,'' Heller said.
   In the quartets, one person sings the lead or melody line, a
tenor sings above the melody and a baritone usually below, with the
bass welding the sound of the other three together.
   Competitions are held in each of the group's 16 North American
districts twice a year for both the quartets and choruses, and an
international champion is crowned once each year.
   The international competition this year will be held July 3-10
at San Antonio, Texas, when about 12,000 people will gather at the
group's annual convention.
   The society was formed in 1938 at Tulsa, Okla., by a group of
businessmen who liked four-part harmony.
   One of the district competitions is scheduled Monday at Tulsa,
and a plaque is to be dedicated there at the site of one of the
group's early meeting places.
   There were 480 chartered chapters in the United States and
Canada by 1948, and Heller said there are now national groups in
Great Britain, Sweden and New Zealand and local groups in other
parts of the world.
   Heller said the society bought a mansion at Kenosha in 1957 and
turned it into the group's international headquarters, known as
Harmony Hall.
   It was located at Kenosha because of the city's central
geographic location and because a larger concentration of the
members live in the center of the country, Heller said.
   The society now employs 44 people, he said, producing a bimonthy
newsletter and organizing the annual meetings as well as other
activities to encourage barbershop singing.
   ``We arrange music in barbership style, sell sheet music and
hold clinics,'' Heller said.
   Heller said membership in the society has held steady for about
the last 10 years. ``There are more retired people involved, but
also more high school quartets,'' he said.

<HEAD>Acquittals Pose Dilemma For White Supremacist Movement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FORT SMITH, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The acquittals of white supremacist
leaders accused of plotting to overthrow the government poses a
dilemma for them and their followers: how to justify their
opposition to a government that treated them fairly.
   Some of those familiar with the movement say that Thursday's
verdict acquitting all 13 defendants of sedition and other charges
effectively neutralized the supremacists, whereas conviction would
have only made them martyrs.
   But others fear the verdicts by the all-white federal jury will
only encourage the extremists in their campaign of violence, aimed
particularly against blacks and Jews.
   ``They were protesting about the federal government and now
they've been treated fairly by the federal government,'' said
television producer Peter Lake, who testified about his experiences
as an undercover reporter at an Aryan Nations compound in Idaho.
``That's going to have a telling effect.''
   Kirk Lyons, a Houston attorney who represented defendant Louis
Ray Beam Jr., agreed. The supremacists' view of conviction would be
that ``they were shanghaied,'' he said, but the outcome proves
``they got a fair trial in an American court,'' which they had
labeled impossible.
   Former U.S. Attorney Asa Hutchinson, who won racketeering
convictions against leaders of an Arkansas-based supremacist group
called the Covenant, the Sword and the Arm of the Lord, was not as
optimistic that the movement would lose credibility because of that
contradiction.
   ``I always said that a conviction would pretty much put an end
to violence by these hate groups,'' he said. ``I'm afraid some of
them will look at this acquittal as a license to their hate and
violence.''
   Nine defendants, including Beam, were found innocent of plotting
to overthrow the federal government by force to set up an all-white
nation in the Pacific Northwest.
   Five defendants were acquitted of charges they conspired to kill
a federal judge and an FBI agent, and two were acquitted of charges
they transported stolen money across state lines.
   The government said the supremacists robbed banks and armored
trucks of $4.1 million, including about $1 million still missing,
to finance their activities.
   One juror at the seven-week trial indicated that jurors did not
believe the prosecution's witnesses. A key witness for the
government was a former supremacist leader serving 20 years in
prison for racketeering.
   Six of the defendants are also serving prison terms for a
variety of other offenses, including murder.
   In Atlanta, Eva Sears of the Center for Democratic Renewal, said
the far right would ``view that acquittal as a green light. They
are going to step up their activity. So it is very, very important
that those of us who love democracy become more vigilant'' and get
involved in community activities that resist supremacists.
   ``And not just the target groups, the blacks and Jews, but
everybody's got to get involved,'' she said.
   Urban League President John Jacobs also was fearful of the
verdict's impact.
   ``We are seeing a climate that is permissive of racist
behavior,'' he said. ``People have become comfortable in engaging
in this climate. Every time something like this happens, it sets
back the whole movement for fairness, equality and justice. You can
be a racist and get away with it, and that is a very disturbing
message.''
   The trial did take a toll on the white supremacists' time,
energy and finances, and that will help speed a shakeup among
leaders of the movement, Lake said. The movement's style and
paraphernalia will change, he predicted.
   ``We're not going to see the old signs, like the Nazi swastika
or the burning cross any more,'' he said. The government repeatedly
referred to the use of such items in the trial.
   Some of the older leaders ``told me that they were going to get
out of the business, in essence,'' Lake said. ``They're going to go
home and write books, pass their churches on to someone else.''
   Defendant Richard G. Butler of Hayden Lake, Idaho, is 70 and
underwent a quadruple bypass heart operation last year. Butler is
pastor of the Church of Jesus Christ Christian at Hayden Lake and
founder of the Aryan Nations.
   Robert E. Miles, 63, pastor of The Mountain Church of Jesus
Christ at Cohoctah, Mich., said he and Butler are not likely to
remain leaders much longer.
   But he said it's hard to predict their successors because the
next leadership level consists of ``splintered chieftains'' of
relatively small ``clans with a c.''

<HEAD>Congress May Postpone Asbestos Removal From Schools</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Education officials are urging Congress to
give them more time to rid the nation's public and private schools
of cancer-causing asbestos.
   The officials say there is insufficient money and trained
manpower to meet this October's asbestos-inspection deadline, set
in 1986 by a Congress upset with the slow pace of the battle
against the deadly substance.
   But groups representing teachers, parents and school employees
are opposing a deadline extension, arguing that such a step is
unwarranted and would prolong long-term health threats faced by
millions of schoolchildren.
   So far, the Reagan administration is staying officially neutral
in a growing debate that finds both sides saying their main concern
is the safety of children attending an estimated 31,000 public
schools believed to contain asbestos.
   Once a common building material, asbestos is dangerous when it
becomes friable, or crumbly. Friable asbestos releases the fibers
that can cause a variety of respiratory ailments, including lung
cancer. The fibers pose more threat to a child's lungs than to an
adult's.
   In 1986, Congress ended a struggle with the administration by
passing legislation requiring school districts to inspect for
friable asbestos and to render it harmless, either by removing it
or stabilizing it.
   The law was a response to hit-and-miss abatement efforts by the
Environmental Protection Agency, which in the 1970s began a
voluntary program against asbestos in schools.
   In 1982, the EPA issued a regulation requiring every school
district to inspect for the substance by January 1984 and to notify
school employees and parents if friable asbestos were found.
   There was no requirement that any other action be taken. Six
months after the deadline, only 11 percent of the districts had
complied completely with the regulation, which had been broadly
attacked as too weak.
   Even worse, the EPA itself acknowledged that where school
districts took action against friable asbestos, much of the removal
work was performed by unqualified ``rip-and-skip'' contractors who
filled the air with fibers.
   Under the 1986 law, school districts have until this October to
carry out a new round of inspections and prepare plans to abate
friable asbestos and until July 1989 to begin carrying out those
plans.
   ``Many local public school districts are incapable of
compliance,'' a hearing by two Senate Environment subcommittees was
told recently by Robert Anderson, representing the National School
Boards Association.
   The association, joined by groups like the American Association
of School Administrators and the Council for American Private
Education, has written lawmakers asking for a deadline extension.
   Their argument is that because the EPA didn't issue regulations
implementing the 1986 law until last October, there is insufficient
time to comply.
   First, they say, there aren't enough trained people to inspect
schools and draft abatement plans. The 1986 law limits this work to
people certified as qualified by the EPA, which set forth training
requirements in last year's regulation.
   The school officials also say there is a shortage of accredited
laboratories to test the asbestos samples; some states haven't had
a chance to repeal anti-asbestos laws that conflict with the
federal law; and some districts lack inspection and abatement funds.
   John Moore, head of EPA's office of pesticide and toxic
substances, said training courses are turning out 2,000 certified
asbestos inspectors a month and that there should be enough to meet
the October deadline, although there could be shortages in some
states.
   Moore told the hearing that while the administration has no
position on the deadline question, his personal view is that an
extension ``should not be done lightly.''
   Pressed by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., about the prospects
for compliance with the 1986 law, Moore said: ``I think the vast
majority of school districts can meet the deadline.''
   Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, and nearly 100 House colleagues are
sponsoring a bill to push the deadlines back a year.
   Oxley says one problem is that school districts are getting
widely different bids from contractors to perform inspections and
draft plans. Lima, Ohio, got bids ranging from about $63,000 to
over $142,000 for its 17 school buildings, according to Oxley.
   ``The possibility that some unscrupulous firms might be taking
advantage of school districts under the gun to meet the deadline
should not be dismissed lightly,'' Oxley recently told a House
hearing.
   ``Not only are the tight deadlines forcing some schools to pay
inflated prices, in some cases the tight deadlines are compromising
the health of our children by helping cause shoddy inspections and
insufficient management plans,'' Oxley said.
   Paul Spell of the Texas Association of School Boards said that
keeping the current deadlines ``may result in hasty, unsound and
inefficient compliance actions that could jeopardize the health and
safety of millions of public school children and school employees.''
   These views are not shared by groups representing school
employees and the parents and teachers of the children.
   ``By extending the deadlines, Congress will be sending a message
to school districts that it is acceptable to continue to ignore or
delay action on this serious health issue,'' says Ann Lynch, first
vice president of the National PTA.
   Keith Geiger, vice president of the National Education
Association, a teachers' group, says that ``if school boards had
taken immediate steps to comply with the law ... the overwhelming
majority would be in a position to complete the inspection and plan
development requirements on time.''

<HEAD>Rattlesnake Hunters, Environmentalists Square Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hunters estimate that 500,000 Texas diamondback
rattlesnakes were harvested last year, fetching about $50 apiece,
but naturalists say the booming business in rodent-eating snakes is
leading to an environmental bust.
   Rattlesnakes ``are a natural part of the ecology _ it's not like
the communists let them go to terrorize Texans,'' said David
Barker, a Dallas herpetologist, or one who studies reptiles.
``They've been there for a million years.''
   The snakes are in great demand for medical research and
commercial products ranging from exotic trinkets, earrings, belts
and paperweights to $10-per-pound snakeburgers and $40 snakeskin
caps.
   Those cashing in on the snake trade are mainly small-time
operators whose numbers have swelled to several thousand since the
``Urban Cowboy'' craze popularized snakeskin attire in the early
1980s.
   More recently, the oil bust has made snake-hunting an attractive
source of supplemental income _ about $5,000 a year for the most
enterprising.
   ``Cowboys, oil wells and snakes are related to Texas _ that's
what people up north think,'' said George Wills, who calls himself
the ``world's largest manufacturer of rattlesnake products.''
   He employs 28 people at a rattlesnake slaughterhouse in Brady
where diamondbacks are killed in a miniature guillotine, processed
and turned into offbeat products.
   Wills said his best customers are retailers in New York,
Pennsylvania and other Eastern states.
   ``Praise the Lord for Yankees, or we couldn't be in the snake
business,'' he told the Dallas Morning News.
   But naturalists are warning that the business could be a
disaster for the delicate balance of nature.
   A decrease in their number could lead to an explosion of
disease-carrying rodents and rabbits that cost millions of dollars
in crop damage, said Jeffrey Black, a professor of biology at
Oklahoma Baptist University.
   A decline in the rattlesnake population ``could cause a general
collapse of an ecosystem,'' Barker said.
   Bill Ransberger, a Sweetwater snake hunter and handler, has
survived 40 rattlesnake bites. But he says he steers clear of
``those environmentalists.''
   ``You have to be careful with them,'' he said. ``You don't
argue. You just walk away.''
   ``It's hard to get favorable publicity for rattlesnakes,'' said
Jim Seippel, an Austin engineer who serves as chairman of the legal
affairs committee for the Greater San Antonio Herpetological
Society.
   Nonetheless, environmentalists have gone on the offensive. Last
month, 26 Texas animal rights and environmental groups banded
together for the first time to protest a rattlesnake hunt at Taylor.
   Two protesters dramatized their concerns by chaining themselves
to a fence. Police responded by throwing a tarp over the
protesters, who soon unchained themselves and went home.
   The consortium of groups is organizing a nationwide
letter-writing campaign directed at the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department. The group's goal, Seippel said, is to encourage the
department to regulate the number of snakes killed and outlaw the
practice of pouring gasoline into logs and animal holes to force
snakes out into the open.
   Snake hunters say they are rendering a service _ ridding the
state of the dangerous reptile, educating crowds who gather at the
roundups and promoting safety.

<HEAD>Economist Says Local Officials Hostile, Citizens Afraid of Reform</HEAD>

   An outspoken Soviet economist says Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reform effort is being jeopardized by hostile local
officials and suspicious consumers who fear they'll suffer for any
progress.
   Nikolai Shmelev wrote in the April edition of the literary
journal Novy Mir that key agricultural reforms have completely
failed. He also criticized some of Gorbachev's initiatives.
   He said the Soviet leader's anti-drinking campaign has done
little but make moonshiners rich and that officials are misguided
in trying to restructure the economy and accelerate growth at the
same time.
   Shmelev proposed a deeper reform of farming, an increase in
imported food and consumer goods, and better use of Soviet
financial reserves.
   The criticism in the article and Shmelev's previous scathing
attack on the Soviet economy, published in last June's Novy Mir,
are among the sharpest made publicly by a Soviet economist.
   ``It is impossible not to see that a hidden opposition to
perestroika (restructuring) is growing in the regions from the side
of many local party, government and economic officials,'' Shmelev
said.
   The economist said that while they pay lip service to
Gorbachev's reforms, a ``silent conspiracy'' against him could be
developing or may already have developed among local officials and
bureaucrats in Moscow.
   Gorbachev needs some successes in the near future to show that
his program is working, but his rural opponents have paralyzed the
system, Shmelev charged.
   In rallying support for his reforms, Gorbachev has put pressure
on local and central bureacrats and blamed them for slowing the
progress of his restructuring effort.
   But Gorbachev also has noted that Soviets still have seen little
improvement in the quality or supply of food or consumer goods.
   Shmelev said promises that food prices will go up have
frightened many Soviets into thinking the reforms will hurt them.
He said that fear results from the way government agencies have
operated in the past.
   Officials, who have promised that they will increase benefits
and wages to match price increases, must make an all-out effort to
convince honest workers, the elderly and those with low incomes
that they have nothing to fear from the reforms, he said.
   Shemelev said efforts to open more private garden plots and
allow collective and state farms to sell some of their produce on
the open market have failed because of local bureaucracy and the
central government's own demands for food.
   In his article last year, Shmelev urged that farms be allowed to
decide for themselves how much and what kind of goods they would
grow without any interference of state planning officials.
   He said the ``disastrous'' situation of Soviet agriculture is a
result of the ``unlimited power that administrative layers have
held all these decades over everything that lives in the villages.''
   Shmelev said the effort to combat alcoholism, Gorbachev's first
major initiative upon taking power in 1985, had done little but
send millions of rubles of government income from vodka sales into
the hands of moonshiners. The Soviet Union's serious drinking
problem will not be solved until consumers are offered something
else to buy with their money, he said.
   Gorbachev has called for increasing the quality and quantity of
industrial and food production. But Shmelev said neither has
increased and that planners were unrealistic to expected increased
production while they were trying to restructure the foundations of
the economy.
   Soviet officials have been cutting back on some imported goods
such as coffee and tea but could make a quick improvement in
supplies to consumers by sharply increasing such imports, he said.
   The Soviet Union could pay for such imports and strengthen
itself economically by learning to make better use of credit,
shareholding and foreign loans and by providing better terms for
joint ventures, he said.

<HEAD>World Finance Officials to Discuss Cutting Poor Country Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Finance officials from 151 nations begin a
week of closed-door sessions Monday, continuing the search for ways
to cut the Third World's trillion-dollar debt.
   The annual sessions at the headquarters of the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund likely will include discussions of
a number of proposals to deal with the huge debt of the Third World
countries, including one that would create about $29.5 billion in
new money.
   Officials agree that the Third World needs more money to
increase production of goods and provide more jobs so that its
people will have the money to buy the goods and improve their lives.
   But there are many opinions among world bankers and officials
about how the needy countries should get the money: what proportion
should come from government grants, from private investment, from
new loans by commercial banks or other lending institutions, or
from direct or indirect forgiveness of old debts.
   Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III has been pushing a
``menu'' of choices for commercial banks, which are owed about 75
percent of the debt. Growing fear that the loans will never be
fully repaid has spurred the banks to take new tacks.
   The menu includes many items that would reduce the face value of
the debts owed to the banks. One is a ``debt-equity swap'' in which
a bank exchanges the money owed to it and gets shares in the debtor
country's industry. This has been done most extensively in Chile.
   Other proposals are variations of a Mexican plan that swaps old
debt of doubtful value for a smaller amount of new debt backed by
the U.S. Treasury.
   In a confidential memo to World Bank officials and member
countries, bank President Barber Conable suggested more menu items.
One would have banks simply waive part of the interest owed them. A
waiver of 2 percentage points would provide the 17 most heavily
indebted countries with $5.6 billion the first year, he calculated.
   The Institute of International Finance, speaking for 165 banks
in 38 countries, has asked the IMF to create the $29.5 billion in
new money. That would help the debtors keep up with old loans and
borrow more. It is about the same amount that Baker asked from the
World Bank and private banks more than two years ago for 15
countries heavily in debt.
   Third World countries have repeatedly asked the fund to issue
more money in recent years, but the idea has been opposed in the
United States, Japan and West Germany. U.S. officials have said it
would foster inflation.
   One critic, Richard Feinberg, vice president of the Overseas
Development Council, said the banks' suggestion would mostly help
the banks. The council is a private group that studies Third World
issues.
   Conable will present a report to the two institutions' joint
development committee on Friday that says rich countries
increasingly are seeing poorer countries' debt as a threat to their
own growth.
   The more poor nations have to pay on past loans, the less money
they have to buy what the rich nations have to sell, notes the
World Bank president, who is a former Republican congressman from
New York.
   The World Bank and the IMF are owned by the same 151 countries.
The Washington meetings are one of two major gatherings held
annually. The other will be in Berlin at the end of September.
   Representatives of Third World countries will meet among
themselves and with those from industrial countries during the
week. The wealthier countries have their own sessions, with
officials from central banks, like the U.S. Federal Reserve system,
participating.
   The two world financial organizations are led by the United
States and other non-Communist governments. China, Poland, Hungary
and a few others also belong. The Soviet Union is not a member
although there have been reports that Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev would like it to join.
   A session is planned at the U.S. Treasury on Wednesday among
Baker and his counterparts from Japan, West Germany, France,
Britain, Italy and Canada.
   This Group of Seven, known as G-7, has set up about 10
``indicators'' of how their countries work, including such
statistics as inflation and the size of the government's surplus or
deficit compared to the country's total production. The complete
list of indicators has not been made public.
   Baker is trying to get one included that will use the price of
gold, among the prices of other commodities. This is being resisted
by some officials who see it as a step toward return to the gold
standard for currencies.
   The seven will review what has happened in each country with
relation to these indicators, in the hope that the record will give
each some hints on what course future policies should take.

   Retired U.S. Rep. John H. Dent, who
served in Congress for 20 years, has died of heart and kidney
failure after a long illness. He was 80 years old.
   Dent died early Saturday at Jeannette District Memorial Hospital
in Jeannette.
   The Democratic politician retired from the House of
Representatives in 1978 after representing western Pennsylvania's
21st Congressional District for two decades.
   Before winning election to Congress, Dent served in the state
Legislature, winning election to the Pennsylvania House of
Representatives in 1934 and to the state Senate in 1936, according
to his family.
   A Mass of Christian Burial will be held Tuesday at Blessed
Sacrament Cathedral in Greensburg. Interment will be private.

   Hannah Louise Tyler, the nation's second-smallest
surviving infant, has come home at last.
   When she was born 11 weeks premature Nov. 5, Hannah weighed in
at 14 ounces, just one ounce more than the nation's smallest
surviving infant. When she left the hospital Saturday, she was a
relatively hefty 6 pounds.
   During most of her five-month hospital stay, Hannah has been
attached to a respirator, but doctors say her lungs sustained
little damage and they have detected no signs of brain damage or
other major problems.
   ``She has avoided any major complications,'' said neonatologist
Dr. Dan Hall. ``We have no evidence of any significant lifetime
handicap.''
   ``I knew she was a fighter,'' Hannah's mother, Kathy Kotlen, 35,
said. ``She's kind of got that inner strength.''
   Hannah's father, Morgan Tyler, 42, a professional contract
bridge player, said his daughter is alive only because ``the
physicians and staff chose to put out the effort.''
   Hannah will continue to receive a small amount of oxygen at home
through a tube to help aid her growth. A pediatrician will see her
once a week, and a physical therapist will help Hannah's mother
develop exercises for the child.

   Sean Connery says he considers himself a
Hollywood outsider despite his Oscar nomination for best supporting
actor in ``The Untouchables.''
   ``Well, first of all I am British,'' the actor, who first
achieved fame as the dashing spy James Bond, said in an interview
in the Chicago Tribune.
   ``Second, I haven't done mainstream Hollywood pictures; I
haven't socialized with the `in' crowd. And even with the Bond
films, I was completely cut out of any involvement in them by the
producers.''
   Connery, 57, who plays veteran Irish street cop Jimmy Malone in
the big screen adaptation of federal agent Eliot Ness' pursuit of
gangster Al Capone, said his penchant for suing when he feels he
has been denied a fair share of a movie's profits also hasn't
endeared him to the industry.
   Connery has his mind very much on Monday's Oscar ceremony.
   ``But the closer it gets, the more you begin to realize that
there is going to be only one winner,'' he said. ``And that is a
bit sobering. And so I don't expect ... to jump up and down if my
name is called. I'm not going to react as if I had just won the
grand lottery in Spain.''

   Television actor Max Gail will speak in
support of the reburial of bodies at Union County burial ground, an
Indian cemetery that was desecrated earlier this year by artifact
hunters.
   Gail, who played Officer Wojohowicz in the comedy series
``Barney Miller,'' will join rock singer Robbie Romero and Indian
folk singers Mitch Walking Elk and Floyd Westerman at the April 17
benefit for the Native American Reburial Committee.
   ``If a few are allowed to rob the earth of evidence of those
cultures, eventually the people end up feeling kind of empty, like
they've been on a junk-food diet,'' said Gail, who has been active
in supporting Indian causes for more than a decade. ``This is a
time for people of Kentucky to connect and feel like a part of

   The former landlord of El DeBarge is
suing the pop singer for $12,000 for damage allegedly done to an
apartment he leased, officials said.
   According to the suit filed Friday by Grand River Investment
Co., DeBarge leased the house from Sept. 11, 1984, until he was
evicted in January 1986. An inspection after his eviction found
damage to the landscaping, interior walls, broken windows, damaged
kitchen cupboards, curtains, carpet and other items, the lawsuit
said.
   ``The place was just trashed,'' said Stephen Ryan, the attorney
for the company, who said DeBarge lived in the house with his
parents.
   DeBarge's uncle, the Rev. William Abney, said the allegations
were ridiculous.
   ``They're picking on him,'' Abney said. ``No other large city
would have treated a star of this magnitude like this.''
   DeBarge reached the top of the pop music charts with the single
``Who's Johnny?'' as well as several songs performed with family
members in the singing group DeBarge.

   The Academy Awards ritual Monday night
features ``The Last Emperor'' as a shoo-in for best picture, but
for nominated performers it's a wide-open race in the Hollywood
tradition of nail-biting suspense thrillers.
   Will Cher's ``Moonstruck'' role win out over Holly Hunter's
``Broadcast News'' performance? Will Michael Douglas take the Oscar
for ``Wall Street,'' or will it go to Robin Williams for his ``Good
Morning, Vietnam'' performance?
   It really doesn't matter because the agenda for most others at
the show concerns career enhancement.
   On the biggest night of the year in Hollywood, it is considered
crucial to be seen by fans, producers, studio moguls and television
cameras carrying the show into living rooms worldwide.
   Bernardo Bertolucci's ``The Last Emperor,'' the kind of
historical epic Hollywood loves to embrace, is favored for best
picture over ``Broadcast News,'' ``Moonstruck,'' ``Fatal
Attraction'' and ``Hope and Glory.''
   Also in contention with Cher and Miss Hunter in the actress
category are Glenn Close for ``Fatal Attraction,'' Sally Kirkland
for ``Anna,'' and Meryl Streep for ``Ironweed.''
   Douglas and Williams are in a best actor battle with Marcello
Mastroianni for ``Dark Eyes,'' Jack Nicholson for ``Ironweed'' and
William Hurt for ``Broadcast News.''
   The supporting performance categories include Norma Aleandro,
``Gaby;'' Anne Archer, ``Fatal Attraction;'' Olympia Dukakis,
``Moonstruck;'' Anne Ramsey, ``Throw Momma from the Train;'' and
Ann Sothern, ``The Whales of August.''
   For supporting actor: Albert Brooks, ``Broadcast News;'' Sean
Connery, ``The Untouchables;'' Morgan Freeman, ``Street Smart;''
Vincent Gardenia, ``Moonstruck;'' and Denzel Washington, ``Cry
Freedom.''
   After acceptance speeches and a backstage question barrage by
reporters, winners embark on an odyssey of party stops where the
reception ranges from hugs, kisses and a back slap to a good,
old-fashioned handshake.
   Even the losers are committed to at least a ``pass-through'' at
the Academy Awards Governors Ball in the exhibition hall of the
cavernous Shrine Auditorium, where the 60th Academy Awards show
will be broadcast live on ABC-TV beginning at 9 p.m. EDT.
   But few big shots stay long enough to enjoy dinner, and shortly
after the Oscars show is over the limousines begin ferrying the
reigning champs of celluloid to celebrations in their honor.
   ``The studios also have their own parties, but we aren't in
competition with them,'' said Charles Powell, chairman of the
Governors Ball. ``Ours is a great table-hopping party.''
   The discreet Governors Ball appearance and early departure have
become a celebrity art form. The night is still young.
   The hottest party is agent Irving ``Swifty'' Lazar's star-fest
at Spago, while the politically conscious, such as Rob Lowe,
Richard Gere, Mel Gibson and Morgan Fairchild, gather at Le
Mondrian to raise money for Central American refugees.
   ``Swifty's is a party you can drop in and out of,'' said
``issues party'' co-chairman Daniel Sladek, calling his a party
with a social conscience.
   The Shrine Auditorium is an ancient hall in a working-class
neighborhood next to the University of Southern California, about
five miles from the sparkling confines of the Los Angeles Music
Center, which had been the Oscars' home for years.
   The Shrine seats 6,308, twice as many as the music center, and
at $150 for the best seats and $300 for the Governors Ball in the
adjacent exhibition hall, the event can supply much-needed funds
for the Academy. The Academy party used to be held at the Beverly
Hilton Hotel.
   ``The cream of Hollywood will be at the Governors Ball,''
promises Powell, noting a turnout of 1,500 is expected. Convenience
is the main reason.
   ``The show and party are all in one unit. They only have to park
once for the evening,'' said Powell, conceding only that the area
surrounding the Shrine ``isn't as nice as Beverly Hills.''

<HEAD>Kuwaiti Cabinet Condemns Hijacking</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Hijack, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cabinet on Sunday condemned the killing of a
hostage on the hijacked Kuwaiti jetliner, and newspapers accused
Iran of backing the hijackers.
   Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs Rashid Abdelaziz al-Rashid
branded the shooting of a 24-year-old Kuwaiti a ``hideous crime,''
the Kuwait News Agency reported.
   He said the Cabinet thanked Cyprus for allowing the plane to
land Friday. After the plane left Iran, the Beirut and Damascus
airports refused to let it land and the the pilot radioed that the
plane was running out fuel.
   The Cabinet also said it appreciated Cypriot efforts to
negotiate for the release of captives aboard the airliner.
   But he said the ministers were firmly determined to uphold ``the
firm principles which Kuwait has always pursued.''
   That was seen as a reiteration of Kuwait's refusal to give in to
the hijackers' demand for the release of 17 terrorists imprisoned
in Kuwait.
   The news agency reported the Cabinet began its regular weekly
meeting Sunday with a reading from the Koran, the Moslem holy book,
``in mourning for the martyrdom of the member of the border guards
force, Mohammed Abdallah Habab Shabib al-Khalidi, who was
assassinated by the criminal hijackers.''
   The independent Al-Anbaa daily said the Iranian government tried
to ``conceal the wave of the wolf ... with a lamb's veil'' by
pretending to negotiate when the plane landed in Iran.
   ``The Iranian rulers ... managed to concoct the play of
negotiations with the hijackers, but in reality they were colluding
with them, and they even masterminded the operation,'' wrote the
paper in its main editorial.
   It was the first outright accusation in Kuwait of Iranian
government involvement in the hijacking of the Kuwait Airways
Boeing 747.
   The hijackers are demanding the release of 17 men jailed in
Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French embassies there in 1983.
   The plane, which was parked at the airport in Larnaca, Cyprus,
on Sunday, was first hijacked to Iran after it left Bangkok,
Thailand, for Kuwait. Iranian authorities condemned the air piracy
and said they were doing everything to try to end the passengers'
ordeal.
   Kuwait has accused the Iranian government of conspiring with the
Moslem Shiite terrorists who pirated another Kuwaiti jetliner in
December 1984. Two Americans were killed.
   That ordeal ended with the Iranians storming the plane after six
days at Tehran's airport. The fate of the four hijackers has
remained unknown.
   The independent daily Al-Qabas said that ``at least certain
political circles in Iran'' were involved in the latest hijacking.
   Quoting an unidentified Western diplomatic source, Al-Qabas
contended that the aim was to influence the outcome of Friday's
elections in Iran.
   It said the piracy was encouraged by opponents of Parliament
Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani because he ``recently started to show
moderation and pursue policies that differ from those of (Ayatollah
Ruhollah) Khomeini.''
   The editor-in-chief of the right-wing Al-Seyassah, Ahmed
Jarallah, quoted the Kuwaiti crown prince and prime minister, Sheik
Saad al-Abdullah Al-Sabah, as saying the hijackers were mistaken if
they thought the presence of three ruling family members aboard the
plane would lead Kuwait to give in to their demands.

   If you want to get to this tiny
community in Northampton County from anywhere in North Carolina,
you'll have to fly, take a boat ride or leave the state.
   ``You know the old saying, `You can't get there from here'?''
said resident Shirley Skinner. ``In our case, it's true.''
   The 17 families who live there year-round and 42 seasonal
dwellers are cut off from the rest of the state by Lake Gaston,
which straddles the North Carolina-Virginia line.
   Residents' mail is handled through the Gasburg, Va., post office
and delivered to mailboxes at the state line. ``I have to drive to
Virginia to get my mail,'' said Betty Dupree.
   ``I have a North Carolina driver's license with Gasburg, Va., on
it,'' Edward Bain Whitten told The News and Observer of Raleigh.
``Explain that one when you get stopped.''
   The pavement on the single road in from Virginia ends at the
state line. North Carolina won't touch the remaining one mile of
road, partly because half of it is privately owned.
   ``You should see it when it rains or when it snows,'' Mrs.
Skinner said.
   ``Or when the sun's out,'' Mrs. Dupree added, bringing laughter
from other residents.

   The lush pastures of Illinois horse
country may seem an unlikely setting for a psychic healer with a
crystal wand, but some of the horsey set swear by her special knack
with their prized thoroughbreds.
   Zandee Zbella _ her first name rhymes with ``hay'' _ combines
conventional massage techniques with unconventional specialties
like Japanese acupressure and psychic readings to treat her equine
clients.
   The psychic horse therapist demonstrated her methods in a recent
session with St. James, a fox-hunting thoroughbred stabled at
Tempel Farms in this northern Illinois town.
   Firmly but gently, she moved her fingertips across the horse's
forehead, rubbing her knuckles along his neck and shoulder.
   ``He can be tense. So we work to get the tension out,'' she said.
   ``It's not the pressure,'' Ms. Zbella said of her technique.
``It's more of a mental communication.''
   St. James' treatment didn't call for the wand, equipped with a
crystal from South America that Ms. Zbella says she uses to attract
and direct positive energies.
   ``Horses are a life force, just like we are,'' she said. ``They
are a mass of energy. In that sense you can treat them using
psychic techniques.''
   ``I'm impressed,'' said Laren Hasler of Lake Forest, who owns
St. James and two other horses. ``She does wonderful things
locating muscle problems and straightening them out.
   ``I don't fully understand what she does. But I have a healthy
respect for it.''

   The Du Pont Co.'s call for an eventual end to
production of ozone-destroying chemicals has other producers
scrambling to decide what they should do, a competitor says.
   Only one of six other companies in the field in the United
States is following Du Pont so far.
   Pennwalt Corp. announced an identical position to Du Pont's on
the same day _ largely overlooked in the attention devoted to giant
Du Pont's announcement that it believes that chlorofluorocarbon
compounds, CFCs, and related compounds should be phased out soon.
   At the other end of the spectrum is Great Lakes Chemical Corp.,
which, says spokesman Gregory J. Griffiths, believes there is no
reason to go beyond the international agreement of last fall to cut
production of these chemicals.
   At various positions in between are ICI Americas Corp., a
subsidiary of Britain's giant ICI Corp.; the Racon subsidiary of
Essex Chemical Corp.; Great Lakes Chemical Corp.; Allied-Signal
Corp. and Kaiser Chemical Corp.
   Du Pont, Pennwalt, Racon, Allied-Signal and Kaiser make CFCs,
used in the United States for refrigeration fluids, cleaning
solvents in electronics manufacture and foam blowing agents.
Overseas CFCs are also used as aerosol propellants.
   Du Pont, ICI Americas and Great Lakes make related
bromofluorocarbon compounds called halons used for fire-fighting.
The effect of the halons on ozone is far more uncertain than the
effect of CFCs. But some theoretical studies indicate they also
could be powerful destruction agents.
   The March 25 statements from Du Pont, the world's largest CFC
producer, and Pennwalt were the first from any company to go beyond
the treaty endorsed by 31 nations in Montreal last fall. So far
ratified only by the United States and Mexico, the treaty calls for
a 50 percent cut in CFC production by 1998 and a freeze on halons
in 1992.
   The conclusions of the two companies were prompted by a March 15
report from a scientific panel organized by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration that CFCs appear to have
caused an average 2.3 percent decline in the earth's protective
ozone layer at northern mid-latitudes between 1969 and 1986.
   The ozone layer protects life on the ground from ultraviolet
rays from the sun. The Environmental Protection Agency has
estimated that a 1 percent decline in ozone means an eventual 4.8
percent to 7.5 percent increase in the most common skin cancers.
   So far, NASA has released only a summary of the work of the
panel. A call Friday to spokesmen for information on further
release plans was not returned.
   ``We are waiting for the data,'' said Bill Corcoran of
Allied-Signal in Morristown, N.J. ``We asked for it the day after
(the summary) was released.''
   Once the complete report is at hand, the company's decision and
those of others will ``probably be pretty quick,'' Corcoran said.
   ``Everybody is scurrying around trying to figure out what the
right thing to do is,'' he said.
   Du Pont's statement was unqualified, saying, the company ``sets
as its goal an orderly transition to the total phaseout of fully
halogenated chloroflurocarbon production.''
   ``Fully halogenated'' means containing no hydrogen. Hydrogen
makes the molecule break down before it can attack ozone.
   Mike Harris, development manager for the chemicals in question
at ICI Americas in Wilmington, Del., said he had to ``reserve more
in-depth comment until we see the full report.''
   ICI ranks just behind Du Pont as a CFC supplier overseas. Like
Du Pont, it will urge governments everywhere it operates to ratify
the Montreal agreement quickly, Harris said.
   Griffiths of Great Lakes said in West Lafayette, Ind., ``Our
position is consistent with where we were before Du Pont's
statement. ... We support the Montreal protocol.''
   At Kaiser in Cleveland, Richard Watts, general manager for
fluorocarbons, said, ``We're not fully sure what Du Pont said.''
Asked if Kaiser agreed that CFCs should be phased out, Watts said,
``We support the Montreal protocol.''
   At Pennwalt in Philadelphia, Lawrence J. Woodward said: ``We
believe, as Du Pont does, that production of fully halogenated CFCs
should be terminated as soon as practicable.'' But the world can't
do it ``tomorrow afternoon.''
   Du Pont has said it may take five years before the paths to
replacement chemicals and agreed international action become clear.

<HEAD>Report: Immigration Law To Force Foreign Nurses To Leave United
States</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS INS spokesman's last name from Jarvis to Jervis in
5th graf, ``We're simply ....'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Thousands of foreign nurses recruited to ease
the U.S. nursing shortage will be forced to return home because
federal immigration officials refuse to extend their temporary
visas, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   The foreign-born nurses were admitted to the United States under
H-1 visas at the request of employers because of the dire need for
their skills, The New York Times reported.
   The Labor Department officially certified the nursing shortage,
the Times said, and the American Nurses Association says about
300,000 nursing jobs are unfilled nationwide, with hospital nursing
vacancies approaching 20 percent.
   But last year, the immigration service ruled that such temporary
work visas would be limited to five years, with a one-year
extension possible, the newspaper said.
   ``We're simply trying to make the actual practice fit the
requirement of the law, which is that these people are here on a
temporary basis and are not supposed to stay indefinitely or become
permanent,'' Verne Jervis, a spokesman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service in Washington, said.
   New York and California will be especially hard hit, the
newspaper reported.
   About 4,000 nurses are affected in the New York metropolitan
area alone, and the first group of five-year visas involving more
than 1,000 nurses statewide expires this year, the newspaper said.
   In California, the number ``has got to be in the ball park with
New York _ maybe higher,'' said Arthur A. Sponseller, vice
president of the Southern California Hospital Council.
   It remains to be seen how strictly immigration officials will
enforce the law. Nurses who fail to leave do not incur any
financial or criminal penalties but they can be deported, the Times
said. But employers face sanctions for having workers who overstay
their visas and who were hired after Nov. 6, 1986, and nurses in
that category are expected to be let go, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Dukakis' Strength: Stronger in New York?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soft support has been the Achilles' heel of Gov.
Michael Dukakis' presidential campaign, but a poll of New York
voters indicates that the commitment of his backers may be
solidifying in the state.
   The development, if confirmed in other polls as the April 19
primary draws near, could improve Dukakis' showing. But that is not
assured: The poll also said Dukakis backers remained less committed
than Jesse Jackson's.
   ``In a low-turnout situation, that favors Jackson because his
supporters are more intensely committed,'' said pollster Lee
Miringoff. ``But the Dukakis support is starting to solidify more.
So it's a mixed situation.''
   The poll by the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion,
released Friday, said Dukakis had the support of 47 percent of
likely Democratic voters in the state, Jackson 31 percent and Sen.
Albert Gore Jr. 6 percent.
   The backing for Dukakis was up 10 points from his standing in
mid-March, while Jackson's was up 3 points.
   As important, Miringoff noted, is that 53 percent of Dukakis'
backers said they supported him strongly, up from 37 percent in
mid-March. Jackson's strong support declined a bit but remained
high, at 67 percent, down from 73.
   ``Clearly there's more intensity among Jackson's people,''
Miringoff said. ``If the more intense voters turn out, that's one
factor that would make this thing get a little closer.''
   While committed voters are more likely to go to the polls, that
factor is not necessarily decisive. In last week's Wisconsin
primary, a CBC News-New York Times exit poll said 45 percent of
Dukakis supporters were strongly for him while as many, 44 percent,
had reservations.
   Jackson's support was much more committed, 60 percent strong to
31 percent with reservations. But it was not sufficient in the high
turnout to counter Dukakis' wider if weaker popularity, and Dukakis
won the race by 20 points.
   Miringoff said the Marist poll indicates that weak support may
be less of a potential problem for Dukakis. ``The process is
further along. There's fewer candidates. The Republican thing is
wrapped up, so the attention is being focused on this race,'' he
said. ``People are picking sides.''
   In earlier races, another important factor has been the large
number of undecided voters selecting their candidate in the final
days. The latest Marist poll, however, found only 6 percent
undecided. The poll had a margin of error of 5 points.
   Miringoff noted that much can change in the New York race. The
new Marist poll was conducted Tuesday and Wednesday, before the
three candidates began campaigning actively in the state.
   A critical factor, the pollster said, is to what extent Gore can
cut into Dukakis' support. Gore's task may be difficult: The poll
said fewer of his supporters were strongly committed _ 40 percent _
and another 27 percent said they might change their minds and vote
for someone else.
   Just 13 percent of Dukakis' supporters said they might change
their minds, and only 7 percent of Jackson's backers said so.
   Still, for Jackson, the slight dip in strong support may mean
that after winning the Michigan caucuses ``he was really peaking
good,'' and has slipped since, Miringoff said. ``The Jackson thing
sort of crested a little bit. That's what we have to watch for,''
he said.
   For Dukakis, he added, ``The direction is good. If he can
maintain that path, he'll be in very good shape.''

<HEAD>Cross-Border Attack Kills Three In Legislator's Family</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sikh extremists crossed into Haryana
state from neighboring Punjab and killed three members of a state
legislator's family, the United News of India reported Sunday.
   In Punjab, Sikh extremists tied three Sikhs to a tree and set
them on fire for using alcohol, the news agency said.
   These and 10 other deaths reported Saturday night and Sunday
raised to more than 690 the number of deaths blamed on Sikh
militants since the start of the year.
   Most of the killings have been in Punjab, which has been torn
since 1982 by Sikh guerrilla activities aimed at creating an
independent Sikh homeland. The victims have included Hindus and
moderate Sikhs opposed to the separatists' activities.
   Rajinder Singh, superintendent of police detectives in Amritsar,
denied weekend reports that the Sikh separatists may have acquired
U.S.-made Stinger missiles.
   He described the reports as ``erroneous, false and baseless.''
   Punjab police officials said Saturday that Sikh militants may
have obtained one or two Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and hidden
them inside the Golden Temple in Amritsar, Sikhism's holiest
shrine. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The officials theorized that the Stinger missiles may have been
smuggled into India from Pakistan, where they have been shipped to
Afghan rebels fighting Soviet troops in Afghanistan.
   In Haryana on Sunday, state police were put on alert and search
operations were launched for the gunmen who tried to assassinate
state assemblyman Harnam Singh, a member of Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi's Congress Party.
   The attack late Saturday night claimed the lives of Harnam
Singh's son and daughter-in-law, UNI said. Another relative also
was shot to death, the news agency said.
   Harnam Singh, his wife and three other family members were
injured in the attack, UNI reported.
   The last cross-border attack came Jan. 1, when Sikh extremists
slipped into Haryana and seriously injured a legislator of the
opposition Indian People's Party.
   In Gurdaspur District in northern Punjab state, three Sikh men
were tied to a tree, doused with kerosene and set afire on Saturday
night, UNI said. The killings were claimed by the Khalistan
Commando Force, one of a dozen Sikh separatist groups operating in
Punjab.
   Police said the guerrilla group accused one of the victims of
``illicit distillation'' and the other two of drinking. All were
Sikhs.
   The Sikhs traditionally do not drink alcohol, and Sikh militants
in the past have attacked liquor vendors and alcohol still
operators to enforce the alcohol ban.

<HEAD>Ottinger Says He Will Suspend Draft Cuomo Effort</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former New York Rep. Richard Ottinger said
Sunday he will suspend his efforts to draft Gov. Mario Cuomo for
the Democratic presidential nomination in deference to the
governor's wishes.
   ``I say suspend because, should it appear that there will be no
convincing front runner at the Democratic convention, I am sure
that all the New York delegates joined by hundreds of other states
across the land will seek to obtain the nomination for Gov.
Cuomo,'' Ottinger said, ``and I shall be among the foremost,
hopefully with the governor's approval.''
   The former congressman, a leader in the draft Cuomo movement,
said he was responding to a letter he received Sunday morning from
the governor.
   On Saturday, Cuomo said ``I've ruled out a draft'' but refused
to clarify the statement.
   Cuomo made his statements on the draft effort as he released the
letter he was sending to Ottinger, asking the Westchester County
lawyer ``not to go forward with your intention to encourage a
draft.''
   Although Ottinger said he will comply with the governor's
wishes, he still will run as an uncommitted delegate in the New
York Democratic primary on April 19. Some of those delegates had
been organized to assist in the draft Cuomo movement.

<HEAD>Rohatyn Calls Koch's Remarks ``Unfortunate''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financier Felix Rohatyn added his voice Sunday
to those criticizing Mayor Edward I. Koch for saying Jews would be
``crazy'' to vote for Jesse Jackson.
   ``I found it very unfortunate,'' said Rohatyn, chairman of the
city's Municipal Assistance Corp., which was created to bail the
city out of its fiscal crisis in the 1970s. He spoke on the WCBS-TV
program ``Newsmakers.''
   ``I'm a Jew. I lived under the Nazis, so I don't need lessons in
anti-Semitism,'' he added.
   Rohatyn said there are legitimate policy reasons to vote against
Jackson, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. But
he said Koch ``takes away from the validity of whatever his
criticism of Jesse Jackson is by wrapping it into this issue of
religious and racial antagonism.''
   ``I'm not at all sure that Reverend Jackson is an anti-Semite,''
said Rohatyn. ``He may be. But I'm perfectly happy to give him the
benefit of the doubt because he says he isn't.
   ``And I think it's as inappropriate to say that Jews are crazy
to vote for Jackson as to say that blacks would be crazy to vote
for Koch. I don't think that helps anybody.''
   Although Rohatyn said he admired Jackson and had met with him to
discuss economic policies, he believes that ``his economic program
clearly can't deal with the situation that we have.''

   Jesse Jackson canceled his Delaware
appearance at the last minute to appear on CBS' ``Face the Nation''
along with Democratic presidential opponent Sen. Albert Gore,
D-Tenn., on Sunday.
   Eight hundred supporters of the Democratic presidential
candidate attended a breakfast for the candidate at the Radisson
Hotel at which Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa., stood in for
Jackson.
   Delaware organizers did not put out the word Saturday night
because they had received no official word from the national
campaign office, said Robert E. Bohm, communications and political
outreach coordinator for Delaware.
   Jackson was also scheduled to preach at a local church and hold
a press conference.
   Delaware's Democratic caucuses are April 18.

   A shotgun-wielding man abducted a
supermarket clerk, then exchanged gunfire with police during a
two-state, 21-car chase that ended when he jumped into the Hudson
River, authorities said Sunday.
   Police plucked Michael Chamandy, 26, of Riverside, Conn., from
the chilly water and charged him with attempted murder and
second-degree kidnapping.
   ``I've never seen anything like it, except in the movies,'' said
Frank Verdi, who watched the cars speed past a restaurant on Route
121 in Lewisboro. ``It was like the `French Connection,' only in
the country.''
   The incident began Saturday morning when a supermarket manager
in Stamford, Conn., confronted a shoplifting suspect, who pulled a
sawed-off shotgun from beneath his coat, forced a clerk into his
car and sped off.
   The clerk, a 45-year-old Greenwich woman whose name was not
given, jumped from the car unharmed after Chamandy was slightly
injured in an exchange of gunfire in Lewisboro, said Stamford
police Lt. Frank Lagan.

   Orthodox Christians mixed national pride
and religious fervor Sunday in Easter celebrations at this
spiritual center and around the world.
   More than 3,500 Orthodox faithful, mostly Greeks on pilgrimage,
watched Patriarch Dimitrios of Istanbul emerge from church after a
midnight Mass. Dimitrios, religious leader of the world's 200
million Orthodox, carried lighted candles to symbolize the
Christian belief in Christ's resurrection.
   Greek President Christos Sartzetakis toured an air force base
near Athens and said the day ``illustrates an unbreakable bond
between Greece and Orthodoxy and voices our hope and determination
for the rebirth of our race.''
   In Vatican City, Pope John Paul II sent Easter greetings to
Orthodox celebrants and called for eventual unity with Roman
Catholics, who celebrated their Easter a week earlier.
   Eastern Orthodox churches, organized mainly along national
lines, do not recognize the Roman Catholic pope's authority over
their activities.
   The Orthodox church began in the Great Schism of Christendom in
1054, when many churches in the eastern half of the old Roman
Empire spurned supremacy of the bishop in Rome. Istanbul has been
considered the center of Eastern Orthdoxy for hundreds of years,
and believers consider Dimitrios ``a first among equals'' in the
churches' hierarchy.
   The bearded 76-year-old patriarch blessed the Easter crowd at
his Patriarchate church and said, ``I wish to all the faithful
around the world the blessing of the resurrected Christ.''
   Church officials there linked a recent improvement in
Greek-Turkish relations to crowded Easter attendance.
   ``This is the largest gathering we've had in a long time. Last
year, we didn't have anywhere near this number,'' said Orthodox
Bishop Bartholomew of Philadelphia.
   Russian Orthodox believers celebrated Easter in a vigil of
chanting and prayers.
   Patriarch Pimen conducted a service for thousands at Moscow's
Epiphany Cathedral. Worshipers craned their necks to see the ailing
78-year-old patriarch, who was helped to move by two priests.
   In an unusual development, Soviet television filmed the service
and showed a segment on a late-night news program.
   The state-run media and other parts of Soviet society are
dominated by the officially atheist Communist Party. The
government, however, has been paying more attention to religion
this year as the Russian Orthodox Church prepares for the June
celebration of the 1,000th anniversary of Christianity in the
region.
   In Athens, church bells pealed Sunday after midnight Masses, and
thousands of Greek Orthodox faithful carried home the symbolic
lighted candles.
   Political leaders and parliamentarians toured Greek military
bases near the capital, joining in traditional celebrations.
Servicemen in camouflage uniforms roasted lamb on spits, cracked
red-dyed eggs with relatives, and performed folk dances in a
day-long party.
   The celebration mixed national pride with religious tradition,
reflecting the role of Orthodox clergymen in the 1821-1827 fight
for independence from Turkey.
   Adherents of Egypt's Coptic Church watched a television
broadcast of Pope Shenouda III's services. Sunday is a work day in
Egypt, but many banks and private businesses closed to observe the
holiday.

   A bitter dispute between a freshman and an
English teacher at Georgia Southwestern College has galvanized
black students, who plan to use the controversy over an alleged
racial remark to zero in on other issues troubling them.
   Ginezra Dennis, 18, a black psychology major from Atlanta, has
accused the white professor, Alan Towery, of referring to her
obscenely on March 7, when she tried to withdraw from one of his
classes.
   Towery said Ms. Dennis accused him of being a racist when he
refused to let her withdraw with a passing grade instead of the
``F'' that she had earned.
   Since the incident, black students have held three rallies and
the U.S. Justice Department has sent a representative to assess the
situation and consider the possibility of future mediation.
   Towery, who has taught at the college for 18 years, was
suspended with pay while a committee of three professors
investigated. The panel submitted its report to GSW President
William Capitan on Friday, and he planned to study the
recommendations over the weekend.
   College spokeswoman Patty Plotnick said Capitan planned to
announce his decision Monday.
   If the panel recommended Towery's dismissal and the president
agrees, it would mean the initiation of a lengthy process,
including hearings, aimed at protecting the tenured professor's
rights.
   ``This is not our favorite moment in time,'' Capitan said in a
recent interview. ``These are things we must work through, and we
will work through.''
   Georgia Southwestern, one of 34 colleges in the University
System of Georgia, offers four-year degrees in psychology, geology,
nursing, business administration and several other fields.
   Capitan said the college attracts students from all over the
state who are interested in professional training and are looking
for the supportive environment that a small campus can provide.
   About 20 percent of the school's 2,100 students are black.
   Kevin Brown, 20, a leader of a recently formed group called
Concerned Student Affairs, said the group's immediate goal is to
force Towery's dismissal.
   Later, the group plans to push for more black professors and
staff and for policies aimed at promoting racial harmony at the
college, Brown, a junior political science major, said.
   Brown and other CSA leaders said the students want the college
to hire more black counselors and stop assigning dormitory rooms by
race. The students said the school has just one black counselor.
Both contentions were disputed by the college.
   ``You don't feel comfortable talking to a white counselor about
a black experience,'' he said.
   Ms. Plotnick said five of the college's nine counselors are
black, and she denied that dormitory rooms are assigned by race.
Forms that students fill out for room assignments do not refer to
race, and once they get a room, students have the option of
requesting a change, she said.
   Capitan said he sensed some discontent among the black students
before the purported incident. Members of his staff used to meet
regularly with black student representatives, but the meetings were
dropped when the students seemed to lose interest, he added.
   Rona Branson, 21, a white student from Americus, said the Towery
incident has unleashed much black frustration.
   ``The black students seem to have a lot of pent-up feelings that
they don't know how to deal with,'' she said. ``I feel like they
need some way to focus on something positive and ways to overcome
the racism they're facing.''
   Hulen Brown, leader of a campus black group known as Sabu, said
black students are concerned about promoting racial harmony, but
that white students do not mingle and do not appear to be care
about better race relations.
   ``The schools are supposed to be integrated, but in essence,
they're segregated,'' she said. ``I see it in my swimming class.
The blacks sit at one end of the pool and the whites sit at the
other end.''

   A tentative settlement has been reached in a
strike by actors and actresses over pay for commercials that run on
cable television, a union official said.
   Members of the American Federation of Television and Radio
Artists and the Screen Actor's Guild who perform in commercials
went on strike March 21.
   The walkout affected all recorded commercials in English or
Spanish on radio and television. The unions have 100,000 members
nationwide.
   The tentative settlement reached Saturday in New York is subject
to approval by the unions' boards of directors, who will meet in
Los Angeles on Tuesday and Thursday, said Dick Moore, spokesman for
the unions. Actors and actresses will not work until the boards
decide whether to approve it.
   Terms of the tentative pact will not be released unless it is
approved, he said.
   The unions have allowed some commercials to be made during the
strike by advertisers _ including presidential candidates _ who
were willing to meet the unions' demands, Moore said. About 400
companies agreed to make commercials under the interim arrangement,
he said.
   But the strike has forced many commercials to be repeated more
often than they otherwise would have been and has forced the use of
``a lot of old stuff,'' he said.

   Jewish settlers Sunday demanded the army chief
of staff resign over an army report that a 15-year-old Israeli girl
was killed accidentally by a settler's gun. They insisted she was
shot by an Arab.
   The settlers and right-wing legislators, including some from
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc, condemned the army for
leaking details before the probe of Wednesday's clash was finished.
   They demanded tough sanctions on Palestinian rioters, including
the expulsion of stone-throwers from Israel, and called for the
destruction of every home in Beita, the West Bank village where
15-year-old Tirza Porat was killed during a holiday outing last
Wednesday.
   Ms. Porat was killed during a clash between Arabs and Jews
outside the town. Two Arabs also died in the melee, and 15 people,
including 13 Jewish teen-agers and two Arabs, were wounded.
   Israel's Supreme Court barred the army from destroying any more
homes in Beita pending an appeal from a civil rights group. The
army says it already has destroyed 13 homes belonging to people it
says incited last week's clash.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told a weekly Cabinet session
Sunday that an army autopsy showed Ms. Porat was apparently killed
by a shot from the M-16 rifle of Romem Al Dubi, a Jewish settler
accompanying the teen-agers on their hike, Israel radio said.
   Israeli media quoted the unpublished report as saying Al Dudi
may have fired the fatal bullet accidentally as he struggled with
the rioters.
   A senior military official confirmed the fatal bullet came from
Al Dubi's weapon. But the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the army had not yet determined who fired the shot.
   Outraged settlers and right-wing legislators challenged the
army's findings Sunday and accused the military of acting on
political motives.
   Geula Cohen, a legislator from the nationalist Tehiya party,
demanded Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron resign. She contended
he based statements about the clash on Arab reports and not on
interviews with teen-agers who had accompanied Ms. Porat.
   Teen-agers who went on the hike said Ms. Porat was killed not by
Al Dubi's gun but by an Arab who shot her with a Soviet-made
Kalachnikov rifle from a rooftop.
   According to an Israel television account of the army findings,
the events leading to Ms. Porat's death began when the 16 hikers
from the Elon Moreh settlement stopped at a dry riverbed near
Beita, 10 miles south of Nablus, to eat breakfast.
   There, the group was attacked from above by stone-throwing
youths from Beita, and Al Dubi fired into the air with his M-16,
the TV account said.
   At that point, Menachem Ilan, the group guide, told Al Dubi
there was no need to fire. But Al Dubi said, ``Shut up,'' and
continued firing, killing one Beita youth, the report said.
   The Israelis continued on a route leading them to Beita, the
account said.
   When the group got to the village, according to the TV account,
an Arab tried to mediate and asked Al Dubi to surrender his gun.
But the settler refused.
   Soon after, the mother and daughter of the Arab killed earlier
hit Al Dubi with a huge rock on the head, causing him to lose
consciousness and fire ``in all directions,'' killing a second Arab
and wounding two others, the account said.
   The TV account did not say how Ms. Porat was killed, but noted
she was struck by an M-16 bullet.
   Rami Hoffman, a 17-year-old settler, and other hikers denied the
TV account.
   Hoffman said Al Dubi only fired near the river bed when he was
jumped by an Arab who tried to take his weapon. He and other hikers
told reporters the Arab was only slightly wounded. They could not
account for either of the Arab deaths.
   Hoffman said the group was then surrounded by about 400 Arab
youths armed with knives and axes who forced them to the village.
   Ariel Avivi, another hiker, said he believed that Ms. Porat was
shot by an Arab in the village.
   ``I looked up and saw an Arab man with a masked face shooting a
Kalachnikov from a rooftop,'' Avivi told The Associated Press. ``I
was in front of Tirza. When I looked down, she was lying there
bleeding from the head.''
   Hoffman said group members were never questioned by military
officials about the clash. Other Elon Moreh residents, however,
said an army brigadier general came to the settlement Saturday
evening and spent several hours talking to settlers.
   An army spokeswoman would not comment on the settler's version
of events.
   Since Palestinians began violent protests against Israeli rule
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in early December, 141
Arabs, one Israeli soldier and one Israeli civilian have been
killed.

<HEAD>Judge Rejects ``CIA Defense'' In LaRouche Trial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge, dealing a major blow to Lyndon
LaRouche, has barred the political extremist's attorneys from
arguing that LaRouche and top aides followed CIA orders in plotting
to obstruct a grand jury investigation.
   In an extensive ruling issued Friday, U.S. District Judge Robert
E. Keeton also restricted the scope of testimony the defense will
be allowed to present regarding alleged FBI harassment and
infiltration of LaRouche groups.
   The judge also denied several requests to dismiss the case,
ruling that defense lawyers failed to show that a prosecutor had
deliberately misled defense lawyers about government infiltration
of LaRouche groups.
   Keeton, however, did find that Assistant U.S. Attorney John
Markham violated an agreement with defense lawyers by not giving
them information about a former LaRouche consultant's dealings with
the FBI. Keeton said he would conduct additional hearings to decide
whether the withholding affected the defense.
   LaRouche, six aides and five of his political groups are on
trial on charges they conspired to obstruct a federal grand jury
investigation into allegations LaRouche's 1984 presidential
campaign raised more than $2 million through credit card and loan
fraud. Four of the organizations are charged with fraud.
   LaRouche, a fringe candidate for the 1988 Democratic
presidential nomination, allegedly ordered three Boston area
fund-raisers suspected of fraud to flee the country. He also
allegedly ordered other supporters to burn incriminating records
and refuse to cooperate with investigators.
   Attempts to stymie the grand jury investigation are detailed in
scores of notebooks seized from LaRouche aides and introduced as
evidence at the trial of Roy Frankhauser. The former LaRouche
security consultant was convicted in December of plotting to
obstruct the investigation. Prosecutors plan to offer the notebooks
as evidence at the current trial.
   Defense lawyers have argued that Frankhauser and others in the
LaRouche organization were working for the CIA and told LaRouche
the agency considered it vital to national security that the
investigation be blocked so that LaRouche would not be indicted.
LaRouche aides then wrote what they believed to be CIA instructions
in their notebooks, the defense attorneys contend.
   Frankhauser and an associate, Forrest Lee Fick, both of Reading,
Pa., are prosecution witnesses expected to be called in the next
month. Defense lawyers had planned to raise the so-called CIA
defense during their testimony.
   Keeton ruled that even if the defense could prove Frankhauser
and Fick worked for the CIA and ordered the alleged obstruction,
defense lawyers could not argue that LaRouche and followers were
protected from prosecution because they were following CIA orders.
   ``The CIA lacked authority to authorize an act of obstruction of
justice,'' Keeton said. ``This defense contention lacks merit as a
matter of law.''
   Keeton also served notice that he would not allow the defense to
present testimony about alleged FBI harassment of LaRouche and his
followers unless it was directly related to the charges in the case.
   Testimony in the trial has been halted for most of the past
month while Keeton considered defense allegations that prosecutors
withheld a variety of documents supporting defense theories that
evidence of the obstruction was fabricated by CIA and FBI
operatives planted in LaRouche organizations.
   The hearings began last month after defense attorneys were given
an FBI document that quoted three intelligence operatives as saying
they had been asked by top FBI and CIA officials to infiltrate
LaRouche organizations.
   LaRouche lawyers sought to have the case dismissed because they
were not given the documents prior to trial. But Keeton ruled
Friday that prosecutors were not required to produce it because the
operatives are not listed as government witnesses. He also said
defense lawyers presented no evidence to counter Markham's
assertion that the men were lying.

   Rioters at a music festival Sunday
stomped on a pregnant woman and shot a 12-year-old boy in the thigh
in a melee that left 25 people injured, authorities said.
   Police said they fired shots in an effort to quell the rioters
at Durban's Kings Park rugby stadium. Their gunfire hit no one, but
some people suffered wounds from low-velocity bullets, possibly
from homemade guns, police said.
   Stabbings and fist fights caused other injuries, according to
police and ambulance drivers.
   The trouble began, witnesses said, when thousands in the crowd
of 120,000 people climbed fences to force their way into the
stadium. Police said robberies and political fights unleashed
further violence.
   Authorities moved in with shotguns and tear gas, firing birdshot
warnings in one instance to disperse attackers trying to rob a
security man.
   The festival of black popular music, with mostly blacks in
attendance, continued after the riot.
   There were no reports of what political factions were involved
in the fighting. Supporters of a banned anti-apartheid group have
clashed with the Zulu political group, Inkatha, in nearby black
townships over the past year.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan called on the Senate on
Sunday to act on two nominations to the Federal Communications
Commission.
   In a speech to the National Association of Broadcasters, Reagan
said that until all five seats on the commission are filled, ``the
FCC can't operate effectively.''
   Reagan nominated Bradley Holmes, chief of the policy and rules
division of the FCC's mass media bureau, last fall to fill one of
the vacancies and in December he nominated Washington lawyer Susan
Wing to fill the other.
   ``Isn't it high time the Senate took action?'' Reagan said in
his speech to about 4,000 broadcasters.
   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C. and chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee, opposes the nominations and has not scheduled
confirmation hearings.
   Hollings and other Democrats in Congress have been critical of
the FCC's deregulatory actions, and were particularly incensed when
the agency last August abolished the fairness doctrine, a policy
that required broadcasters to air conflicting views on
controversial issues.

<HEAD>Nixon Predicts Close Election With Bush Edging Democratic
Candidate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard M. Nixon predicts that likely
Republican presidential nominee George Bush will edge the
Democratic candidate in a November election that will be close
despite peace and prosperity.
   The former president, in an NBC-TV ``Meet the Press'' interview
taped Saturday and broadcast Sunday, said a sound economy and a
nation at peace normally means a landslide victory for the
political party in power. But as historian Alexis de Toqueville
noted, one characteristic of American democracy is restlessness
amid prosperity, according to Nixon.
   ``I think we have some of that today. I think that's one of the
reasons Jesse Jackson has such appeal,'' Nixon said. ``He's
appealing to those who are restless, despite prosperity. And that
is what George Bush must overcome, and that's why I think it's
going to be a close election rather than a landslide.''
   Bush, who holds a commanding lead in the national delegate
count, is expected to win the GOP nomination easily. Jackson and
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis are the front-running candidates
for the Democratic nomination.
   Nixon, asked if Dukakis was too dull to be an effective nominee,
responded: ``I've often said ... that the best politics is poetry
rather than prose. Jesse Jackson is a poet, (New York Gov. Mario)
Cuomo is a poet, and Dukakis is a word processor _ that's what it
gets down to.''
   ``On the other hand, he's cool, he's intelligent, he's tough,
he's good in debates. He's going to be a very formidable
candidate,'' Nixon said.
   The former president has said Jackson is the best candidate in
either party. But if he were white, he would be out of the race,
according to Nixon.
   ``What you have here is a situation where it isn't really the
messenger, the fact that he is black, but it's the message: he is
far to the left of the Democrats, and they are already very far to
the left with Dukakis,'' Nixon said. ``So, under the circumstances,
if he were white, he would have been out already as being too
extreme to have a chance to win.''
   Nixon suggested that if Dukakis gets the nomination, he should
look south for a running mate and consider either Georgia Sen. Sam
Nunn or presidential rival Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee.
   ``Dukakis can't win unless he goes south; his first choice
should be Nunn,'' Nixon said. ``Nunn will help him not only in the
South but also on the issue he's weak on, defense. And his second
choice should be Gore.''
   The former president advised fellow Republican Bush to put aside
his personal feelings, particularly his disagreements with Kansas
Sen. Bob Dole, in choosing a vice president.
   ``I am not saying that he ought to take Bob Dole, but he's got
to remember that one place he's weak is in the farm states,'' Nixon
said. ``Bob Dole won Iowa; he (Bush) lost it. He won Minnesota, he
won South Dakota, he would hold Nebraska, he would hold Kansas.
   ``So as he considers who to take, he's got to remember that it
isn't a question of whether you get along with the person, because,
believe me, if they win they will be bosom buddies thereafter,'' he
said.
   Nixon has scheduled a series of television interviews prior to
the release of his book, ``1999: Victory Without War.'' It is the
sixth he has written since he resigned in 1974 in the wake of the
Watergate scandal.
   In the one-hour NBC interview, he said the book is not a
harbinger of a Nixon political comeback.
   ``My purpose at the present time is, frankly, to get the message
across,'' he said. ``I have some very strong feelings about foreign
policy. I've had a lot of experience, not just in Soviet-American
relations, but in Chinese-American relations, in the Mideast, in
Latin America, Africa, et cetera, Europe. I feel I want to pass on
that experience before I'm too old to be able to do so, to
articulate it.
   ``As far as restoring ... making a comeback, what am I going to
come back to? We already have a very good mayor in Saddle River
(N.J., Nixon's home), and we have a very good governor ... in the
state of New Jersey. It isn't a comeback,'' he said.

   Fallen evangelist Jimmy Swaggart led the
choir but stayed away from the pulpit during Sunday services at his
church, two days after separating from the Assemblies of God.
   Swaggart announced Friday he was resigning from the Assemblies
of God, the nation's largest Pentecostal denomination, shortly
after the church said it was defrocking him in the aftermath of his
confession to a moral failure.
   ``Give the Lord a hand of praise,'' Swaggart shouted while
prancing on the stage as he led the choir in a rendition of ``He
Set Me Free.''
   The 13-member Executive Presbytery of the Assemblies, based in
Springfield, Mo., ordered Swaggart last month to submit to a
two-year rehabilitation plan which included a one-year suspension
from preaching, a harsher punishment than originally ordered by
Louisiana church elders.
   Swaggart said separating from the church was necessary to save
his Bible college and $140 million worldwide ministry. His lawyer,
William Treeby, said the organization is in a precarious position,
but would not fail financially.
   ``We believe that to stay out of the pulpit for a year would
totally destroy the television ministry and greatly adversely
impact the college,'' Swaggart said Friday.
   Soon after the Presbytery ordered the one-year suspension,
Treeby announced that Swaggart would return to the pulpit on May
22, coinciding with the end of the three-month suspension first
ordered by Louisiana church leaders.
   The Rev. Al Trotter, a guest preacher at Sunday's services, made
a brief reference to Swaggart.
   ``Just one thing is agitating me and just one thing is filling
me with nervous anticipation. That's for Sunday, May 22, to roll
around and for the bishop to take the pulpit again,'' Trotter said.
   Swaggart's punishment was handed down after he publicly
confessed to unspecified sin on Feb. 21. A self-described
prostitute said Swaggart paid her to pose nude for him in New
Orleans.
   Another defrocked Assemblies of God minister, Marvin Gorman of
suburban New Orleans, reportedly hired men who photographed
Swaggart with the woman outside a motel.
   According to new ratings, Swaggart's television ministry was in
decline even before his confession.
   Swaggart's weekly program remained No. 1 among religious
broadcasts, but viewership fell from 2.161 million households in
February 1987 to 1.961 million in February this year, Arbitron said
in a report released Saturday.
   Nearly three weeks of the February sweeps period had passed when
Swaggart's scandal surfaced.
   His daily program, ``A Study in the Word,'' fell from 410,000
households to 323,000 households, according to Arbitron. It is
rated 10th in religious programming, according to Arbitron.
   Swaggart's audience fell by 200,000 households or 10 percent
during the year for the weekly program and by 87,000 households or
22 percent on a daily basis, according to Arbitron.
   The television ratings to be taken in May, which would be
released during the summer, will most accurately gauge whether
Swaggart's broadcast influence is languishing because of his
separation from the Pentecostal denomination.
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell's show dropped 40 percent during the
year. The PTL program, once hosted by defrocked Assemblies of God
minister Jim Bakker and his wife, Tammy, did not crack the Top 20.
It had been rated No. 18 in November 1987, when the last ratings
were taken.
   Three cable networks that carry Christian-oriented programs have
threatened to cancel Swaggart's shows, cutting him off from 68
million potential viewers.
   In mid-March, Swaggart's wife, Frances, and son Donnie hosted a
week-long telethon during which they begged viewers to send money
or use their credit cards to make donations to keep the ministry
alive.

<HEAD>Pharmacies, Hospitals Short of Medicine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors and pharmacists said Sunday a
lack of dollars caused by U.S. economic sanctions is causing a
shortage of medicines and broad cuts in hospital services.
   An opposition party leader, meanwhile, said the foreign leaders
who asked the Roman Catholic church to mediate Panama's political
crisis should consider organizing an international boycott to oust
the nation's strongman, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``By doing the first (asking for the mediation) there is an
implicit responsibility to do the second,'' Ricardo Arias Calderon,
president of the Christian Democrat Party, told journalists late
Saturday.
   Monsignor Marcos Gregorio McGrath, the Catholic archbishop of
Panama City, attempted to bring the government and opposition to
mediation at the urging of several Latin American and European
leaders. But he announced late last week the effort had been
suspended.
   Arias Calderon said he did not favor U.S. military intervention
to oust Noriega but added the general might ``try to provoke an
armed intervention that will let him play the role of nationalist
and military hero.''
   Noriega, as head of the 15,000-member Defense Forces, is the
power behind the civilian government. Last February, a federal
grand jury in Florida indicted Noriega on drug trafficking charges.
The United States imposed economic sanctions against Panama after
Noriega rejected Washington's demands that he resign and leave the
country.
   Problems resulting from the American pressure are mounting.
   Pharmacies and hospitals said they are cutting services, running
short of some medicines and have stopped elective surgery, X-rays
and laboratory tests.
   A pharmacist, who spoke with condition he not be identified,
said he could not reorder medicine because pharmaceutical companies
want to be paid in dollars and the banks are closed.
   He said pharmacists could not get credit and he was out of many
medicines, including some antibiotics and heart drugs.
   Doctors on duty at the Bella Vista Clinic said the staff has
been reduced from 92 to 30 and there were only two aides on duty in
the operating room instead of the usual six.
   State television on Sunday showed the arrival of 800 pounds of
medicine sent by Cuba ``as a move of solidarity with the Panamanian
people.''
   Arias Caldron told reporters, ``What has happened is that an
economy in process of development is regressing to a subsistence
economy.
   ``People are leaving the country and say they are not coming
back. Companies are being forced into bankruptcy. Semesters of
school are being lost, semesters that cannot be recuperated.''
   Panama uses the American dollar as its currency and U.S.
sanctions include freezing Panama's dollar deposits in U.S. banks,
withholding payments to the Panama Canal Commision and, most
recently, prohibiting American companies and citizens from paying
taxes to the Panamanian government.
   The taxes are to be paid instead to an account opened for
deposed President Eric Arturo Delvalle, ousted by the National
Legislature on Feb. 26, the day after he tried to get rid of
Noriega.
   Arias Calderon said the latest U.S. sanctions are within the
framework of the boycott he advocates but said it needs to be
multinational.
   A foreign businessman, who spoke on condition he not be
identifed by either name or country for fear of reprisals, said
commercial activity appears to be 20 percent to 30 percent of
normal.
   Some American businessmen have said they can be fined and jailed
in the United States for paying taxes to the government and be
closed down by the government if they don't.
   ``I think we're going to see a lot of closings,'' of American
companies in Panama, the businessman said.
   A statement broadcast on government television Sunday said, ``We
are paying for the intolerable crime of defending our independence
and wanting to resolve our problems among Panamanians.''
   It referred to ``a blockade against the people who have never
been an enemy of the United States.''

<HEAD>East Harlem Chess Team Leaves For Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A team of tough competitors from a school in one
of the city's toughest neighborhoods got their bags together Sunday
to fly to the Soviet Union for two weeks of playing chess.
   ``We'll all happy that we're going to be representing the United
States,'' 15-year-old Jose Tavarez of East Harlem said shortly
before the Sunday evening flight. ``We've very excited.''
   In the last few weeks, Jose and 11 of his classmates at Junior
High School 99 have been learning a few essential Russian words,
including ``hello,'' ``goodbye,'' ``thank you'' and ``checkmate.''
   They are members of the Royal Knights, a nationally recognized
chess team.
   The students will pair up with Soviet chess players for matches
pitting Soviet-American teams against each other, rather than
direct competition between nations. The idea is to stress
international cooperation, not competition, said the Royal Knights'
teacher and coach, William Hall.
   Hall introduced chess to the school as a tool to teach English
to his students, many of whom come from Latin America and Asia. The
students learned English and fell in love with chess.
   During a tournament at the Manhattan Chess Club last fall, the
students met the reigning women's chess champion, Maya
Chiburdanidze of the Soviet Union, and she suggested they visit her
country, where chess is a national pastime.
   While in the Soviet Union, the Royal Knights will visit Moscow,
Leningrad and the resort of Ezheri on the Black Sea, Hall said.
   In May, a group of teen-age dancers from the Soviet city of
Tbilisi will visit the East Harlem group during a trip to the
United States, according to David Kelley, co-founder of Project
Harmony, a Vermont-based organization that promotes U.S.-Soviet
exchanges.

   These are troubled times for AM radio.
   Consider that only three of every 10 radio listeners tune in to
the AM band, and that 1987 local and national advertising sales
were about $2 billion for AM stations compared with $4.9 billion
for FM.
   And consider that 85 percent of AM stations held steady or
dropped in value in the last three years and that three out of four
large-city stations and about half of those in smaller markets make
no money.
   Indeed, the best price fetched by an AM station sold last year
was $20 million for WNBC in New York, the country's biggest media
market. That was far exceeded by KVIL, a Dallas FM station that
changed hands for $82 million.
   ``It's going to be an irreversible trend if we don't move to
find out how it can be turned around soon,'' Bill Moyes, chairman
of The Research Group in Seattle, said in an interview at the
National Association of Broadcasters annual convention here. The
four-day conference started Saturday.
   A number of stations have accepted the challenge and are
experimenting with formats that target specialized audiences:
   _WFAN in New York City broadcasts sports interviews,
commentaries, analysis and play-by-play of games 24 hours a day,
updating scores every 15 minutes.
   _KPAL in Little Rock, Ark., won a Peabody Award last week for
its daily mixture of music, information, trivia quizzes and call-in
features aimed at children ages 5-12.
   _WNN in Pompano Beach, Fla., calls its format ``all
motivation,'' featuring taped excerpts of talks by well-known
self-improvement and inspirational authors. Its logo is ``we're up
when you need to be.''
   _KMNY in Los Angeles airs financial news around the clock, with
reports on stock and commodities markets and the latest mergers and
acquisitions.
   Though traditional AM stations still thrive in some rural areas
lacking FM competition and in some big cities, the AM audience
generally has eroded steadily for the past two decades as the
higher fidelity FM band has grown in popularity.
   Just 15 years ago, nearly three-quarters of the radio audience
was listening to AM. In big cities across the country, the No. 1
stations were AM and they were playing music.
   But in the late 1960s, FM _ then the low-budget stepchild where
people turned mostly for classical music _ began testing new
musical formats from ``easy listening'' to rock. With its deeper
tone and richer sound, it soon found an audience.
   FM has captured a whole generation of young people who hardly
know what AM is. FM now is the band most people tune in when they
want to listen to music. AM has become the band for news, talk and
information, since the spoken voice sounds about the same on AM as
FM.
   ``Music, for all intents and purposes, has all but abandoned the
AM spectrum,'' said David Parnigoni, senior vice president of radio
for the National Association of Broadcasters.
   ``People identify AM with news and information and talk and a
lot of younger people don't listen to that,'' he said. ``As the
population gets older, you're seeing fewer people who want to
listen to AM.''
   Nostalgia formats that play big band music _ most of which was
recorded in mono and appeals to the older audience _ are generally
the only successful music-based formats on AM radio these days.
   Programming is only one of AM radio's problems, though. The band
is plagued by technological troubles as well, and the industry is
working on improving the quality of the AM signal.
   Many in the industry say the Federal Communications Commission
missed an opportunity to give the band a boost five years ago when
it declined to set a single standard for AM stereo transmission.
The FCC said the market should decide.
   Today, only about 10 percent to 15 percent of the stations have
adopted one of the two remaining AM stereo systems still fighting
for a piece of the market _ Motorola Inc.'s C-Quam system, the most
popular so far, and one by Kahn Communications Inc.
   Another technical problem is interference, which worsened as
more stations were crowded into the AM band. There are now 4,912
stations on the AM band and 4,058 on the FM band, but the technical
nature of the two differ, making interference a bigger problem for
the AM stations.
   Some in the industry worry an FCC proposal to expand the AM band
to include the frequencies from 1605 to 1705 will increase
competition in an already fragile industry.
   Despite the problems, however, AM radio broadcasting never seems
to lack for people willing to risk a new idea for keeping a station
on the air, said James Duncan Jr., publisher of Duncan's Radio
Market Guide.
   ``There are always folks out there willing to take a shot,'' he
said.

   Democrat Jesse Jackson said Sunday that as
president he would not sit down with Yasser Arafat, leader of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, to discuss an end to fighting
between Israel and the Palestinians.
   While rejecting direct talks with Arafat, Jackson said the
United States should talk with Palestinians in the search for a
peace in the region.
   Campaigning in New York, which holds its Democratic presidential
primary on April 19, Jackson has come under criticism from Jewish
leaders for his past meeting with the PLO leader. Mayor Edward Koch
of New York said Jews who cared about Israel ``would be crazy'' to
vote for Jackson in the primary.
   About one quarter of the New York Democratic primary vote is
expected to be Jewish.
   Asked about the criticism on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation,''
Jackson said, ``I met with Arafat after I had met with the late
Egyptian president (Anwar) Sadat for the sole purpose of
challenging him to change his posture and move toward a mutual
recognition policy with Israel as opposed to an elimination of
Israel posture.''
   Jackson said ``tough leadership must challenge the Palestinians
to recognize Israel's right to exist and vice versa.''
   Pressed on whether, if elected president, he would sit down with
Arafat, Jackson said, ``I would not. It is not necessary to do
that.''
   He said it was a mistake to equate Arafat and the PLO with the
Palestinians.
   ``In the final analysis, it is not Arafat versus Israel, it is
Israel versus the Palestinians,'' he said.
   ``If we cannot talk with Israel's enemy, we cannot neutralize
Israel's enemy and thereby increase Israel's security,'' Jackson
said.
   Gore, for his part, praised Jackson for saying he would not meet
with the PLO chief.
   ``The statement Jesse Jackson made this morning was very
constructive, that he would not meet with Arafat. That's a change
in his position, I believe,'' Gore said as he campaigned in
Brooklyn.
   Gore was asked if he would characterize it as a ``flip-flop.''
He said, ``No, candidates ought to have a right to grow and
evolve.''
   In September 1979, Jackson went on an 11-day trip in the Mideast
and created a furor among Jewish groups when he met with the PLO
leader and called for an independent Palestinian state. He also
said at the time that the United States should recognize the PLO
and engage in open discussion with the group.
   During his Mideast trip, Jackson urged the Palestinians to take
the black struggle for civil rights in the United States as a model
for efforts to set up a Palestinian homeland.
   ``We became disciplined and determined nothing could stop us
from achieving what was ours: our human rights and our place in the
sun and self-determination,'' he told the Palestinians.
   ``You are very close to your goal of self-determination and a
homeland,'' he said. ``Do not allow acts of terrorism to divert you
from a homeland or from peace and justice.''
   Four years later, with no abatement in criticism of Jackson's
Mideast stand from Jewish groups, the former civil rights leader
said he suffered from a ``misperception'' of his Mideast positions.
   ``I support without equivocation Israel's right to exist,''
Jackson said, but added: ``I do support a state of Palestinian
people. The more that they wander aimless as nomads, the more
dangerous and desperate they become.
   ``When we met with Arafat, we did not endorse him or his
tactics. We challenged him to recognize Israel's right to exist.
... We need to be looking at a mutual recognition policy,'' he said
in November 1983.
   Jackson on Sunday endorsed the recent meeting Secretary of State
George P. Shultz had with two Arab-Americans who are members of the
PLO National Council.
   The Democratic presidential candidate said the United States
should take the initiative to challenge the PLO to amend its
charter to remove the provision calling for the destruction of the
state of Israel.
   Jackson's campaign manager, Gerald Austin, said ``any meting
with Arafat would have to be based on a prerequisite of the PLO
recognizing Israel's right to exist.''
   Austin reiterated that Jackson has no plans to meet with any
Jewish leaders and talk about their specific concerns about his
campaign.
   ``We're not going to let this campaign become a one-issue
campaign,'' Austin said.

   Government officials and legal historians from
around the world gathered Sunday to urge continued international
support for the prosecution of Nazi war criminals and for war
crimes legislation.
   ``There is a continued need to be vigilant,'' said Elizabeth
Holtzman of New York, the Brooklyn district attorney and former
member of Congress who wrote a 1978 amendment barring Nazis from
entering the United States and allowing for their deportation. ``We
can't assume that governments will do the right thing all the
time.''
   Jurists from Australia, Canada, West Germany, France, Israel,
the Netherlands and the United Kingdom joined American officials as
speakers at the third International Conference on Holocaust and
Human Rights Law.
   ``The Waldheim affair, the Demjanjuk trial in Israel and the
Barbie trial in France have all three contributed to a renewed
discussion everywhere in the world and have rekindled the fire of
people's emotions,'' Paul M. Brilman of the war crimes section of
the state attorney's office in the Netherlands wrote in a speech
prepared for the conference.
   Bruce Einhorn, an attorney with the U.S. Justice Department's
Office of Special Investigations, said: ``I don't think people will
ever forget. I think there's a strong sense of doing justice.''
   But he noted that time left to take action on war crimes is
limited because both the perpetrators and the survivors of the
Holocaust are getting old.
   Conference participants said that the sense that time is
dwindling prompted the Canadian and Australian governments to
establish anti-Nazi war crimes investigative units for the first
time last year.
   In Canada, a report on the need for war crimes legislation by
conference participant Jules Deschenes, a judge on the Superior
Court of Quebec, acted as a catalyst for change.
   ``The government just didn't want to do anything for 42 years,''
said David Matas, former chairman of the Canadian Jewish Congress'
Legal Committee on War Crimes. ``But there's a sense of a deadline
that if we don't do something soon, the accused will be dead and
the damage done by the justice system will be irreparable.''
   Robert Greenwood, director of war criminals investigation for
the Australian attorney general, said his country's search for
Nazis ``is still in the early days yet. But it's alleged we have a
number of war criminals.''
   Matas said increased pressure to find and prosecute war
criminals is needed because of a recent ``flare-up of Holocaust
denial.''
   ``It's a form of neo-Nazism,'' said Matas. ``When we ignore the
Holocaust by denying it, we add fuel to the fire of neo-Nazis.''
   The conference was sponsored by the Boston College Law School
Holocaust-Human Rights Research Project and the Anti-Defamation
League of B'nai B'rith-Rena Herstein of Warsaw Memorial Fund.

   Timothy S. Mayer, a playwright, theater director
and lyricist who was nominated for a Tony Award for writing the
book for the hit musical ``My One and Only,'' has died. He was 44.
   Mayer died Saturday of lung cancer, The Boston Globe reported
Sunday.
   A native of Linlithgo, N.Y., who lived in Boston, Mayer
graduated from Harvard in 1966 and returned to his alma mater in
1980 as artist in residence.
   In 1981, he staged ``Alladin,'' a musical he co-wrote with the
late composer Peter Ivers. It was staged at the Agassiz Theater in
Cambridge, which Mayer had co-founded at the age of 22.
   His Tony nomination came for the 1982-83 Broadway season. ``My
One and Only,'' which premiered on Broadway in May 1983, starred
model-turned-actress Twiggy and dancer-actor Tommy Tune in a
boy-meets-girl plot wrapped around 17 George Gershwin tunes.
   Mayer was associate director of the Boston Shakespeare Co. and
in 1984, with Peter Sellars, staged the widely acclaimed production
of Bertolt Brecht's ``Mother Courage.''
   In 1985, he was associate director of the American National
Theater and directed its first production, part one of
Shakespeare's ``Henry IV,'' at the Kennedy Center in Washington.
   Mayer's songwriting included work with James Taylor, Peter Wolf
and Donald Fagen. Mayer wrote the lyrics for ``Home By Another
Way'' on Taylor's current album. He also co-wrote, with Fagen,
``Century's End,'' a song performed by Fagen in the movie ``Bright
Lights, Big City.''
   At the time of his death, Mayer was working on a play about Rip
Van Winkle.
   Funeral services were scheduled for Wednesday in Boston.

   More than two-thirds of pilots responding to a
survey said flying has become more dangerous in the 10 years since
deregulation began, but many stressed they continue to regard it as
the safest way to travel.
   The survey of 1,360 pilots with air transport certificates was
taken by The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution, which
published the results in the newspapers' combined Sunday editions.
   Sixty-eight percent of the pilots said they considered air
travel less safe since the government began deregulating the
airline industry in 1978. Two said air travel is safer now and 29
percent found no change.
   But 82 percent said they never had been pressured to fly a
mechanically unsound plane, and 77 percent rated maintenance as
good or excellent. Sixteen percent said they had been pressured to
fly unsafe planes; 19 percent rated maintenance as fair or poor.
   The survey also found 47 percent said air travel is just as safe
now as before the 1981 firings of striking air traffic controllers,
and 11 percent said it is safer. Thirty-nine percent said safety
has declined since the strike.
   More than half the pilots added written comments, the newspapers
said, and many of them said air travel is still essentially safe.
   ``The press is not giving the airlines a fair shake _ the U.S.
airline system is far and away the safest in the world,'' said a
pilot for Trans World Airlines.
   Many pilots criticized the Department of Transportation's
6-month-old practice of releasing figures on airlines' flight
delays and customer complaints. Many said their airlines were
distorting the statistics.
   ``The government's efforts to reduce delays by keepings
statistics is merely a publicity stunt the Transportation
Department has undertaken to make the general public believe
something is being done when they are actually doing nothing to
solve the problem,'' a USAir pilot wrote.
   About two-thirds of the pilots responding to the survey work for
passenger airlines or private charters. The others work for
corporations, overnight package or freight services or identified
themselves as general aviation pilots.
   The survey was conducted by mailing questionnaires to 2,200
pilots with commercial licenses. Of those questionnaires, 875 were
returned; pollsters then telephoned a random sample of those who
did not respond to ensure the survey was unbiased. A total of 485
pilots were telephoned.
   In theory, the newspaper said, the study has a margin of error
of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

   The close fight for the Democratic presidential
nomination will help the party in the general election while Vice
President George Bush is starved for media attention, Democratic
Party chief Paul Kirk said Sunday.
   Democratic National Committee Chairman Kirk said the battle
between Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, Jesse Jackson and
Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore is the party's strength, not its
weakness.
   On the Republican side, Kirk said, Bush has had little media
exposure since early March, when his near-sweep on Super Tuesday
all but wrapped up the nomination for him.
   ``I missed the Republican debate about pedigree, family fortunes
and blind trusts,'' Kirk said as he attended a $500-per-plate
luncheon to raise funds for the final election this fall.
   Earlier in the GOP campaign, Sen. Bob Dole needled Bush for his
silver-spoon background and the Bush campaign raised questions
about the handling of Dole's wife Elizabeth's blind trust.
   ``It was not really a debate about the future of our country,''
Kirk said.
   Many Democrats have expressed concern that a protracted
nomination fight would allow Bush to gather strength while the
Democrats attack one another.
   But Kirk said, ``Every one of these candidates has said
privately and publicly that if they don't get the nomination,
they'll be supportive of whoever is.''
   Dukakis has a slight lead over Jackson in the latest AP delegate
count, 745 to 708. Kirk said it was unlikely any candidate would
emerge at the end of the primary season with the 2,082 delegates
necessary to clinch the nomination.
   But he said there would likely be a winner on the first ballot
at the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta.
   ``A mathematical majority may not come until the roll is
called,'' Kirk said. Selecting a nominee without any destructive
infighting at the convention is crucial to victory in November, he
said.
   ``We have the opportunity to go to a convention and demonstrate
that by conducting our own business properly, this party is ready
to go on and lead the country,'' he said, ``as long as everyone is
treated fairly and everyone plays by the rules and doesn't try to
change the rules in the ninth inning.''
   The latter portion of his remark apparently referred to Jesse
Jackson's vocal dissatisfaction with party rules in 1984.
   Sunday's fund-raiser was slated to raise more than $250,000 for
the party's presidential ``victory fund.'' The party has raised $3
million to date this year toward a goal of more than $8 million,
the federal limit for a national committee to spend toward the
final election.
   Party spokeswoman Julie Anbender said the party is already ahead
of its 1984 fund-raising performance of $2.3 million.

   Officials of other Moslem states offered support
Sunday for Kuwait in its hijack crisis as a two-day meeting of
Islamic leaders opened.
   ``We unequivocally condemn this outrage,'' said Sharifuddin Pir
Zadeh, a Pakistani who is secretary-general of the 46-nation
Organization of Islamic Conference.
   ``In this hour of deep distress, we express full solidarity with
Kuwait and for its principled stand in refusing to yield to
blackmail and pressure of hijackers,'' he said.
   The hijackers are threatening to kill passengers on the Kuwait
Airways Boeing 747 unless the Kuwaiti government releases 17
pro-Iranian terrorists convicted of bombings in Kuwait in 1983.
   At least six gunmen commandeered the jumbo jet Tuesday while it
was en route from Thailand to Kuwait. The pilot was forced to land
first in Mashhad, Iran, and then flew the jetliner to Larnaca,
Cyprus, Friday.
   The Islamic gathering was attended by the leaders of seven
Moslem nations other than Kuwait, including Pakistani President
Mohammed Zia ul-Haq and Palestine Liberation Organization chairman
Yasser Arafat.
   But Zia announced he would return home immediately after
explosions Sunday at an ammunition dump on the outskirts of
Islamabad killed more than 70 people and injurd at least 800.
   Arafat, who arrived from Moscow, told reporters the PLO was
``doing our best for our brothers the Kuwaitis'' in trying to
mediate an end to the 6-day-old hijack standoff.
   Before leaving, Zia told the conference chairman, Sheik Jaber
al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti emir, that Pakistan's people were
with the Kuwaitis in ``your hour of difficulty.
   ``We hope that the tragedy of the victims of this incident of
international terrorism will soon be relieved,'' he said.
   The meeting is to report on implementation of decisions made at
the 1987 Islamic summit concerning the Iran-Iraq war, the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the war in Afghanistan. The 1987
summit was hosted by Kuwait, and the emir is the chairman of the
conference through 1989.
   Others attending were Presidents Kenan Evren of Turkey and
Maumoun Abdul-Gayoum of the Maldives, Prime Minister Ezzeldin
al-Laraki of Morocco and Foreign Ministers Mukhtar Bong of Gabon
and Ibrahim Faal of Senegal.
   The Kuwaiti emir deplored the escalation in the Iran-Iraq war
and appealed to Iran to respond to peace efforts whether they are
carried out by the United Nations or the Organization of Islamic
Conference. Both warring parties are members of the conference.
   Although Iran refused to receive an Islamic delegation the 1987
summit had tried to send to Tehran, ``our hope in the future
exceeds our regret in the past,'' the sheik said. Iran and Iraq
have been at war since September 1980.
   The Kuwaiti ruler praised the Palestinian uprising in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip as ``the sound of right
which has crashed through the sound barrier that the Israeli entity
is trying to impose on the Palestine question.''
   He added: ``The uprising reflects the Palestinian people's
determination to regain their inalienable rights, including the
right to self-determination and the setting up an of an independent
state under PLO leadership.''

   Former vice presidential candidate Geraldine
Ferraro says she partly blames herself and her candidacy for her
son's cocaine conviction because it made him ``a target,'' and says
the family will appeal the verdict to the Vermont Supreme Court.
   ``We still believe he was set up,'' said Ferraro of her
24-year-old son, John Zaccaro Jr. But she acknowledged that he had
possessed cocaine, and said his legal troubles showed him ``the
horrors of drugs.''
   A Vermont District Court jury deliberated for slightly more than
two hours Saturday before finding Zaccaro guilty of selling
one-quarter gram of cocaine to an undercover police officer while
he was a senior at Middlebury College two years ago.
   No sentencing date was set, and an appeal could take two years.
The felony conviction carries a maximum sentence of five years in
jail and a $10,000 fine.
   In a statement after the verdict, Ferraro blamed her son for
possessing cocaine, as well as herself ``and my candidacy for
making my son a target.'' Ferraro ran on the Democratic ticket with
Walter Mondale in 1984.
   ``We are a concerned family who has lived through a very
difficult two years,'' she said. ``We love our son. We do not
minimize in any way his use of drugs at Middlebury College or the
fact that Middlebury College is the place where drugs was available
to so many students and continues to be so. It was wrong.''
   ``There are four people who are guilty in this whole episode,''
Ferraro said. ``John for possession. We are grateful that God has
chosen this way to show him the horrors of drugs. Me and my
candidacy for making my son a target.''
   Ferraro's statement went on to name former Middlebury police
Sgt. David Wemette ``for setting my son up'' and Addison County
State's Attorney John Quinn for ``prolonging the agony for two
years'' by rejecting a plea bargain.
   ``We, as his parents, would not allow him to plead guilty'' to
the felony charge of selling cocaine, Ferraro said. The family had
asked prosecutors to allow Zaccaro to plead guilty to a lesser
charge of possession of cocaine.
   But Quinn would not accept a plea for less than a felony.
   ``If she wants to be angry at me for not reducing the charge,
that's her prerogative. I didn't feel there was any justification
for reducing the charge,'' Quinn said. ``There was plenty of
evidence he was selling. I never considered a possession case and
they know that,'' he added.
   Ferraro pointed to several drug cases recently heard in Vermont
in which plea bargains were arranged easily and light sentences
were given to defendants accused of selling larger quantities of
drugs.
   ``That may or may not be true. I know there are some cases like
that. It depends on the particular prosecutor. It depends on the
particular circumstances of the case,'' Quinn said.
   ``I recently prosecuted a guy on a felony charge for 37
marijuana plants. Perhaps in some counties they might have reduced
that. But as time goes on, I feel more strongly about drug cases. I
just think it's becoming more of a problem in the country and we
need to deter that,'' Quinn said.
   The defense also had raised the argument that Zaccaro was
unfairly singled out because of the publicity surrounding his
mother, but the Vermont Supreme Court refused to overturn the
charges on that basis.
   Jury selection lasted four days, prolonged by wide publicity the
case had gained, but the verdict came only one day after the trial
itself began.
   Opening arguments and testimony began Friday, with the defense
claiming Zaccaro was entrapped by a young, inexperienced,
attractive undercover police officer. ``This is a case of improper
and overzealous police conduct,'' Zaccaro's lawyer, Charles
Tetzlaff, argued.
   He called no witnesses, instead basing his defense on attacks on
the prosecution witnesses and attempting to show the police
investigation was based purely on rumor and that the undercover buy
was poorly executed.
   But Quinn said Zaccaro was a well-organized drug dealer. He
described the deal with undercover officer Laura Manning as just
another sale.
   ``When he takes a packet off the tray, he opens it up, being the
good merchant that he is, ... looks at it, wraps it up'' and gives
it to Manning, Quinn said.
   Manning's drug buy came Feb. 20, 1986. Quinn said it was
arranged after an anonymous note was left on Wemette's desk in the
fall of 1985 with Zaccaro's name, address, car registration and the
words: ``The Pharmacist.'' Police and prosecutors said Zaccaro had
earned the nickname because of his reputation as a drug dealer.
   Wemette testified he first heard rumors of Zaccaro's drug
dealing in 1984, but did not pursue them because Zaccaro left
college to help his mother's campaign.
   Most Middlebury students questioned about the case said the
outcome did not concern them. ``My sophomore year it was more
interesting. But now, half the people on campus weren't even
here,'' said Bob Woithe, a senior from Palm Island, Fla.
   The college had reacted to the arrest by forming a task force
that made 20 recommendations to address student drug abuse, most of
which have been adopted. They include the hiring of a health
educator, publication of a drug brochure, additional security
staff, and improved relations with the Middlebury police.

   Black students at Penn State
University who were arrested after a 15-hour sit-in gathered at a
local church Sunday, and said they still hope to meet with the
university president.
   ``As long as we have one voice and stay consistent, we can
pretty much have the university do what they say they want to do,''
Robert Blair, a student leader, told a group of 100 protesters and
supporters.
   Blair and other student leaders have said Penn State has failed
to live up to promises to adequately increase black enrollment and
faculty, and give blacks equal opportunity.
   Last fall, Penn State failed to reach a court-mandated goal of 5
percent minority enrollment. Penn State has 2,424 blacks, or 3.6
percent of its student body of about 67,000.
   ``We addressed the same problems 20 years ago as we do today. We
don't want to have to address the problems in the '90s,'' said
Robert E. Ross, an alumnus who is an officer with Division 851 of
the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers in Philadelphia.
   Ross said he had been contacting fellow alumni to try to get
support and possibly legal representatation for the students.
   Students who had occupied a university building and their
supporters gathered to map strategy before a service at the United
Black Fellowship Community Church, a half-mile from the campus.
   Student leaders said they still wanted to meet with university
President Bryce Jordan and senior administrators to discuss
minority concerns.
   More than 150 students, most of them black, began their
occupation of the university's telecommunications building Friday
afternoon when Jordan did not show up for a scheduled meeting with
black student leaders.
   Police ended the sit-in Saturday morning by arresting 91
students for trespassing or disorderly conduct. Other students
participating had already left.
   Jordan, in a statement issued Saturday night, said a meeting
remained possible with the black student leaders.
   ``We wish to discuss their concerns under mutually agreeable
conditions so that the university's affirmative action program can
move forward with the support of the entire Penn State community,''
Jordan said.
   Bill Mahon, a Penn State spokesman, said Jordan and other top
administrators didn't attend Friday's meeting because the
administration couldn't reach student leaders to discuss the
meeting's ground rules.

<HEAD>Bargainers Says Chrysler Workers Earned Job Security Assurances</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Union bargainers preparing to represent Chrysler
Corp. employees at national contract negotiations say they will be
demanding job protections that workers earned through years of
sacrifices.
   United Auto Workers Vice President Marc Stepp, who took charge
of the union's Chrysler department in 1977, first led national
negotiations with the automaker in 1979. This year's talks,
covering 59,500 active and 8,000 laid-off workers, will be his last.
   Before he retires, Stepp said, he wants to finish bringing
Chrysler workers back on par with their counterparts at the top two
automakers, General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
   The UAW signed contracts with Ford and GM last fall that forbade
layoffs for any reason except slow sales. Job security is just as
big an issue at Chrysler, which has pushed constantly to
``outsource,'' or move work to lower-cost outside suppliers.
   The bargainers say they need protection from moves such as
Chrysler's recent attempt to sell its 28,000-worker Acustar Inc.
parts subsidiary. That plan, which Chrysler backed down from last
month, caused such bitterness that labor and management decided to
start negotiations early instead of waiting to begin talks in
mid-July. Chrysler's contract expires Sept. 14.
   Chrysler Vice President Anthony St. John has acknowledged that
Chrysler will work within the pattern established with Ford and GM.
He has said that Chrysler wants to reach an early settlement to end
the strife with its workers.
   Part of Stepp's goal in this year's talks is a two-year
contract, so that all Big Three contracts will expire together in
1990 for the first time since 1979.
   That year, the union's Chrysler council and all local UAW
officials _ about 1,400 delegates _ met in Kansas City, Mo., and
approved deep sacrifices to save the ailing No. 3 automaker.
   The UAW eventually gave nearly $2 billion in concessions while
helping win support in Congress for $1.2 billion in federal loan
guarantees to rescue Chrysler, which began operating in the black
again in 1982.
   More than 140 Chrysler council delegates returned to Kansas City
last week for a strategy session before returning to the table
April 18.
   Stepp instructed bargainers not to speak to reporters, and those
delegates who would talk refused to be quoted by name. But almost
with one voice, they insisted that workers shared the credit with
Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca for turning the company around.
   ``We were a family, a team. Lee Iacocca was just a guy who'd
been fired by Ford,'' said one delegate.
   In a debate over whether to include about 1,000 former American
Motors Corp. UAW workers from Kenosha, Wis., under the Chrysler
contract, several opponents used the same argument: that they
didn't live through the cuts.
   The Kenosha workers eventually were admitted last week, but with
limits on how their seniority would transfer into other Chrysler
plants. Chrysler bought AMC last August, leaving 1,000 workers at
two Kenosha installations to either bargain with Chrysler on their
own or come under the national contract.

   Many Cypriot families spent the Greek
Orthodox Easter watching events in the Kuwaiti airliner hijack
drama at Larnaca's beachside airport, which continued to operate.
   More than a dozen cars and motorbikes lined a road beside the
airport. People sat atop sandy knolls nearby to watch the
blue-and-white Kuwait Airways jumbo jet through binoculars.
   With the airport functioning normally, tension was not evident.
   Police officers, armed with automatic rifles, stayed well away
from the plane.
   Few people were allowed to approach the Boeing 747, which was
hijacked Tuesday on a flight from Thailand to Kuwait by at least
six gunmen. Portable generators used to power air conditioning and
lights occasionally were changed as they ran out of fuel on the
tarmac beneath the plane.
   Food and supplies were pulled up by rope. After breakfast was
provided Saturday, the hijackers said passengers were asking for
cigarettes.
   The hijackers obviously were well informed about the plane. When
told that the food was still frozen, they said they already had
turned on the microwave ovens.
   And when a spare air conditioner was taken aboard they said they
didn't need instructions on how to install it.
   At one point, two hijackers, wearing blue hoods, appeared in the
plane's doorway and threw a huge bag onto the tarmac.
   It contained the emergency chutes that had been ripped out to
block any possible escape attempt by the passengers.
   ``What about the chutes you threw out of the aircraft?'' the
control tower asked by radio.
   ``Well, take it away. It belongs to Kuwait Airways,'' the
hijacker who has served as the plane's spokesman replied in broken
English.
   There was a request from the plane for the times of sunrise and
sunset in Cyprus, indicating the Moslem hijackers wanted to know
the proper time to kneel and pray facing the holy city of Mecca in
Saudi Arabia.
   For other sections of the small airport, which has only four
departure gates, it was business as usual as the summer tourist
business began to slowly increase.
   Airliners flew in and out past the Kuwaiti jetliner parked at
the end of a runway beside the Mediterranean.
   Journalists set up shop in a second-floor conference room. They
were silent when a radio monitor, set to the frequency of
communications between the plane and the control tower, began
broadcasting..
   Conversations between negotiators and hijackers were
surprisingly polite and calm, even when the gunmen said they had
killed a passengers and a coffin was needed.
   But the hijackers warned officials against stalling when they
were told that no one could be found to refuel the jet because of
the holiday. Other planes were taking on fuel within sight of the
hijackers.

   Cannons boomed and church bells tolled
Sunday for the 129 men who died a quarter of a century ago aboard
the USS Thresher in the nation's worst submarine disaster.
   A memorial service at 275-year-old North Church drew more than
800 relatives of the men who died aboard the Thresher and people
associated with the nearby Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.
   The Thresher, the most advanced sub of its time, left the
shipyard for a routine cruise, developed problems with its nuclear
reactor and failed to resurface from a dive in the Atlantic 220
miles off the New England coast. Eventually water pressure crushed
its hull, killing all aboard.
   The sub's pieces remain on the ocean bottom.
   ``No scar was visible ... to show where she sank,'' Lawrence
Shoberg, a Navy chaplain, said at the service. ``But there would be
scars: scars on the hearts of parents without children, wives
without husbands, children without fathers.''
   Retired Rear Adm. Dean Axene, a former commander of the Thresher
who shared the task of breaking news of the deaths to the families
on April 10, 1963, said Sunday that the Thresher, in his mind,
``remains a mighty ship, manned by a mighty crew still sailing the
sea.''
   ``She was intended to reach a new peak of perfection. And she
did, but the price was very high,'' Axene said.
   When the two-hour memorial ended, the Marines performed a 21-gun
salute outside the church, while the shipyard sounded a 21-cannon
salute and area churches tolled their bells.
   While attending such services is more pain than some can bear,
Neil Collier believes he must remember.
   Collier, 4 when his father, Merrill, died, spent three years on
a sub and is an instructor at a Navy training center in Saratoga
Springs, N.Y.
   ``The memorial service ... is a big deal to me every year,''
Collier said. ``But from my point of view, the Thresher incident
and what impact it had on national defense is really why it's
important.''
   Collier said the inquiry into the Thresher disaster led to safer
submarine design.
   ``Many, many lives have been saved because those guys gave their
lives,'' Collier said.
   A Navy board concluded the Thresher's problems probably started
with a leak in the saltwater piping. The board said water had
shorted out electrical circuits and shut down the nuclear reactor,
leaving the submarine powerless.
   The Navy developed a submarine safety program based on the
board's findings that included stricter construction methods and
testing for saltwater piping, more initial shallow-water sea trials
and design improvements.

   Here is a chronology of events in the hijacking of Kuwait
Airways Flight 422.
   TUESDAY, April 5 _ The Boeing 747 with 112 people aboard,
including three members of the Kuwaiti royal family, is hijacked by
Arabs on a flight to Kuwait from Bangkok and diverted to Mashhad in
northeastern Iran. The hijackers demand freedom for 17 pro-Iranian
extremists jailed in Kuwait for their convictions in the bombings
of the U.S. and French embassies there in 1983. They threaten to
blow up the plane if the demand is not met. Kuwait refuses. One
passenger with heart condition is released. Kuwait asks Iran not to
allow the plane to take off.
   WEDNESDAY, April 6 _ Kuwait sends a team to Iran to negotiate
with the hijackers but vows not to yield to their demands. The
hijackers release 24 women passengers and call a doctor on board to
treat passengers they describe as ``unwell.''
   THURSDAY, April 7 _ The hijackers release 32 more hostages and
again threaten to blow up plane if security forces attempt ``any
threat against the plane.'' The plane is refueled after hijackers
fire on airport security guards and threaten to force the plane to
take off with fuel tanks near empty.
   The gunmen agree to give the prime ministers of Turkey and
Pakistan until early Friday to negotiate with Kuwait to try to end
ordeal.
   FRIDAY, April 8 _ The deadline passes while Turkish and
Pakistani prime ministers negotiate with Kuwaiti officials. The
plane leaves Mashhad but is refused permission to land in Syria and
Lebanon, despite pleas from the pilot who says the fuel tank is
nearly empty. After seven hours in the air, the plane lands at
Larnaca, Cyprus.
   SATURDAY, April 9 _ The hijackers kill a Kuwaiti security guard
on the plane and toss his body onto the tarmac after their demands
for more fuel are not met. The pilot reports that captives are
being beaten. The PLO's deputy director in Cyprus and two Cypriot
officials go to the plane and talk with hijackers. The hijackers
free another captive.
   SUNDAY, April 10 _ Negotiations with PLO officials continue. The
hijackers threaten a ``slow and quiet massacre'' and say they'll
force the pilot to take off and crash into the Kuwaiti royal palace
if demands are not met.
   In Lebanon, the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad terrorist group
threatened to kill kidnapped foreign hostages if any attempt was
made to storm the plane. Twenty-two foreigners are missing after
being kidnapped in Lebanon, including nine Americans. Islamic Jihad
claims its members kidnapped three Frenchmen and two Americans.

   A trolley car derailed in a subway tunnel
Sunday and hit several pillars and a wall, injuring the driver and
26 riders, officials said.
   The accident shortly before 7 a.m. on the eastbound trolley at
the 33rd Street Station shut down the city's subway-surface tunnel,
according to Donna Alston, a spokeswoman for the Southeastern
Pennsylvania Transportation Authority.
   The tunnel carries trolleys from street lines underground to
City Hall.
   The cause of the crash was under investigation, Ms. Alston said.
   All but two of the injured persons were treated and released
from hospitals, officials said.
   The driver, Anthony Taylor, 22, of Philadelphia, was listed in
critical condition at Hahnemann University Hospital with a deep leg
gash, spokeswoman Phyllis Fisher said.
   Lilly Morgan, 37, of Philadelphia was admitted for overnight
observation, Ms. Fisher said.

   President Reagan said Sunday the expected
withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan was ``a major
contribution'' to improving East-West relations and pledged
continued U.S. military aid to the Afghan rebels.
   Differences over U.S. and Soviet aid to rival factions in
Afghanistan had been a major obstacle to negotiations in Geneva on
a settlement of the eight-year war and the withdrawal of an
estimated 115,000 Soviet troops.
   However, the two sides appear to have agreed on a compromise
under which the Soviets will continue providing aid to the Marxist
government while the United States gives assistance to the
anti-communist insurgents.
   Reagan, in a speech to the annual convention of the National
Association of Broadcasters at a downtown hotel, said he
anticipated an agreement would be signed in Geneva ``in the very
near future'' for a Soviet withdrawal.
   The pact, negotiated under the auspices of the United Nations,
is expected to be signed this week, with the Soviet Union and the
United States guaranteeing a settlement of the war.
   ``If that accord is complied with, and the Soviets withdraw
irrevocably from that long-suffering country, this will be a great
victory for its heroic people, whom we shall continue to support,''
Reagan said.
   `It will also be a major contribution to the improvement of
East-West relations,'' the president added.
   The United States had offered to cut off aid to the Afghan
rebels, but insisted that the Soviets stop supplying the Afghan
government. The Kremlin balked, saying it was obligated by treaty
to aid the Kabul regime.
   Offering a compromise, the United States suggested a policy of
``symmetry'' allowing the two sides to give assistance to rival
factions.
   Arriving in Las Vegas, Reagan was asked if a deal had been
struck on Afghanistan. ``We're very optimistic, but nothing's been
signed yet,'' he said.
   The president got a warm reception for his speech from the
audience of several thousand broadcasters.
   Reagan stopped in Las Vegas briefly before flying back to
Washington Sunday night after a 10-day vacation at his mountaintop
ranch near Santa Barbara, Calif.
   The speech was the first in a series of foreign policy addresses
Reagan will make before he visits Moscow May 29-June 2 for his
fourth summit meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Reagan specifically said he will be talking about human rights
and regional conflicts in the coming weeks.
   Reagan said U.S. foreign policy toward the Soviet Union has
changed ``from containment _ the mere defense of our interests _ to
a strategy based upon the expansion of freedom.
   ``Nowhere has the world movement toward freedom and democracy
been more in evidence than in what might be called the outposts of
Soviet expansionism,'' Reagan said.
   ``For in Afghanistan, Cambodia, Africa, and, yes, Nicaragua, we
see domestic insurgencies directed against communist tyrants,''
Reagan said. ``And it has been a central part of our new strategy _
part of our new commitment to the expansion of freedom _ to help
them.''
   Referring to Nicaragua, Reagan said, ``It's no secret that I
believe Congress should have done more, much more, to aid the
freedom fighters.'' However, he said a humanitarian aid package
signed into law early this month ``will do much good.''
   Reagan also used the speech to comment on conditions in the
Soviet Union, saying it was a country that could not feed itself.
``And consider this, endless shortages and long lines force the
average Soviet family to spend two hours shopping every day just to
obtain the necessities of life.
   Reagan challenged Gorbachev to tear down a ``grim, invisible
wall of oppression'' that blocks the free flow of information and
ideas to Soviet-bloc nations.
   ``It is the wall that prevents the Communist world from joining
the West in this new age _ this dazzling new age _ of prosperity
and creativity,'' Reagan said.
   Specifically, he called on Gorbachev to open the Soviet Union to
Western newspapers and journals, permit Western broadcasts to go
unjammed and to permit access to all books.
   ``Here I have a specific first step to suggest,'' Reagan said.
``Mr. Gorbachev, open the Soviet Union to the works of a great man
and an historic author. Open the Soviet Union to the works of
(Alexander) Solzhenitsyn.''
   Solzhenitsyn, one of the Soviet Union's most famous dissidents
and writers, lives in exile in the United States.

   A huge ammunition dump exploded
Sunday, sending flames 500 feet into the air and grenades and
anti-aircraft missiles screaming in all directions. Officials said
more than 70 people were killed and at least 800 injured.
   The Pakistani capital looked like a city at war after the
exploding dump showered it and adjacent Rawalpindi with grenades
and shells of all shapes and sizes.
   ``It's the worst disaster we've ever had in Islamabad,'' said an
emergency room doctor at the National Medical Institute as he
directed ambulances with a bullhorn.
   Prime Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo ordered a high-level
investigation into the blast. Officials said the explosion was
caused by a fire but they did not know how the fire started.
   Later, the official Pakistani News Agency reported that eight
people were killed and 12 injured Sunday afternoon when a fire
broke out in a small arms manufacturing factory at Rana town, near
Lahore and 140 miles south of islamabad.
   The agency did not say what caused the fire and gave no further
details.
   Several hours later in Karachi, a bomb exploded in a fruit bowl
in the cargo section of the offices of Saudi Airlines, injuring
three people. Police said three floors of the eight-story building
in the heart of the port city were damaged. Karachi is about 650
miles southwest of Islamabad.
   Three years ago an explosion in the Saudi Airlines building in
Karachi killed four people and wounded seven.
   There have been numerous explosions and bomb attacks in Pakistan
during the past two years that have killed an estimated 300 people
and injured hundreds of others.
   The government frequently has blamed attacks on agents of
Afghanistan's communist government, which has denounced Pakistani
support of Afghan rebels. But many bombings have occurred during
violent demonstrations by opposition parties demanding the
resignation of President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq.
   Casualty counts still were unofficial Sunday night in the twin
cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, where the metropolitan area has
a combined population of 4.5 million.
   ``Our hearts are broken and our eyes are welled up,'' said
President Zia in a statement from Kuwait, where he was to attend an
Islamic summit.
   He announced he would return immediately to Islamabad.
   The initial explosion occurred at 9:55 a.m. shortly after the
start of the Moslem work week.
   Within minutes, hundreds of grenades and missiles took off, some
landing and exploding more than six miles away. For the next 35
minutes, projctiles whizzed overhead, slamming into buildings and
roads. Some scored direct hits on buses and cars.
   One rocket struck the auditorium of the International School of
Islamabad where the pupils, mostly children of foreign diplomats,
had sought refuge.
   It started a fire but none of the children were hurt, the school
said.
   Another rocket landed just outside the U.S. Embassy compound but
there was no damage.
   The ammunition dump is at Faizabad Crossing, near the capital's
border with Rawalpindi.
   Eyewitnesses said several trucks with Afghan license plates were
parked near the army facility, suggesting some of the ordnance was
earmarked for Afghan rebels fighting Soviet-backed government
troops in Afghanistan.
   Pakistan serves as a conduit for U.S. military aid to the
insurgents but neither Pakistani nor U.S. officials would comment
on the nature of the depot's contents.
   Army troops and riot-clad police were deployed in force around
Islamabad to seal off dangerous roads and prevent panic.
   But many Pakistanis, some spattered in blood, ran screaming and
crying in search of family members among the smoldering buildings.
   The fire continued burning throughout the afternoon, crackling
with the explosion of small arms ammunition.
   The Ministry of Defense warned people not to touch unexploded
grenades or missiles.
   Hospital emergency rooms were bloody scenes of chaos. Ambulances
with sirens wailing shuttled in the wounded. Crowds, some arriving
in buses, came to donate blood or inquire about loved ones.
   One of the dead was identified as a lawmaker and former minister
of Production and Public Works, Khaqan Abbasi, whose car was hit by
a rocket.
   None of the estimated 25,000 foreigners living in Islamabad was
reported hurt.
   The government announced three days of national mourning, during
which flags would fly at half mast and all official functions would
be canceled.
   Islamabad is a suburban-like city of about 500,000 built during
the 1960s to replace Karachi as the capital. In addition to
government buildings, it contains about 85 foreign embassies and
several offices of U.N. and other international relief agencies.
   Later, the official Pakistani News Agency reported that eight
people were killed and 12 others injured Sunday afternoon when a
fire broke out in a small arms manufacturing factory at Rana town,
near Lahore about 140 miles south of islamabad.
   The agency did not say what caused the fire and gave no further
details.

   President Reagan has invited Kuwait's crown prince
and prime minister, Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, to visit the
United States, Kuwait announced Sunday.
   Rashed Abdel-Aziz al-Rashed, minister of state for Cabinet
affairs, told reporters the invitation was intended to discuss ways
of strengthening relations and exchanging views on issues of mutual
interest.
   He did not say whether the invitation was connected to the
hijacked Kuwait Airways jumbo jet and the terrorists' demand that
Kuwait release 17 terrorists convicted for the 1983 bombings of the
U.S. and French embassies here.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said he was unaware of
the invitation. However, White House policy usually is to allow
other countries to announce such visits first.

   An FBI marksman ended an 19-hour siege
Sunday by killing a Connecticut fugitive who had been lured out of
a farmhouse where he was holding his 3-year-old son and the child's
mother, authorities said.
   A single shot felled Charles A. Leaf II, 30, as he ran from the
house to a nearby FBI helicopter, said agent Terry T. O'Connor. He
was holding the woman, Cheryl Hart, 27, and their 3-year-old son,
Charles Leaf III, at gunpoint, O'Connor said.
   Leaf was accused of kidnapping the two April 2 from their
Trumbull, Conn., home.
   Ms. Hart and the boy were shaken but uninjured in the shooting,
which occurred shortly after 3 p.m., O'Connor said. Leaf was
pronounced dead on arrival at the University of Virginia Medical
Center.
   Trumbull police Capt. Frederick Nacovitch described Leaf as a
construction worker who moved from place to place and had a history
of domestic violence involving Ms. Hart.
   Authorities here began looking for Leaf after finding his 1973
Chevrolet April 3 in a remote area of Rappahannock County, about 50
miles west of Washington, D.C.
   O'Connor said authorities intensified the search Saturday night
when evidence was found indicating Leaf may have been in a barn
adjacent to a farmhouse.
   ``Agents entered the farmhouse shortly before 8 p.m. Saturday
and were immediately confronted by Leaf,'' O'Connor said. Leaf was
armed with a 9mm rifle and was holding the woman and child in an
upstairs bedroom.
   As authorities negotiated with Leaf over the hours, he fired
three shots from the rifle, but did not strike anyone, O'Connor
said.
   ``Leaf repeatedly threatened to kill the woman and child as well
as the FBI agents,'' O'Connor added.
   Leaf eventually was persuaded to leave the farmhouse and go to
the waiting helicopter, but was shot before he got to the craft,
said O'Connor. He declined to give details such as what might have
been promised Leaf to get him to leave the house or how far the
helicopter was from the house.

   Dallas Cowboys running back Herschel
Walker, best known for his blistering speed and bruising bursts
through defensive lines, made his ballet debut Sunday to the cheers
of a fan-filled crowd.
   About 1,300 people attended the season finale of the Fort Worth
Ballet's ``story series'' _ well above the usual numbers for a
Sunday afternoon performance, officials said.
   The Heisman Trophy winner took part in ``Webern Pieces,'' a
modern ballet performed with the Fort Worth company's principal
dancers, Maria Terezia Balogh and Joseph Malbrough.
   The muscular Walker said tackling the dance moves was not easy.
   ``When you play football, you have a helmet to hide behind and
nobody can see your eyes, but it's a lot different out there on the
stage,'' Walker said. ``In football, you can improvise if you make
a mistake, but if you do it here everyone knows it.''
   The audience broke into laughter and applause when Walker and
Malbrough ended their piece in the three-point stance Walker uses
while in the Cowboys backfield.
   However, most were more impressed with Walker's being on stage
than with the dance moves of a running back who took a single
college ballet course.
   ``I kind of wish he would've danced a little more, but I do
admire him for making that kind of contribution,'' D'Lana Anderson
of Fort Worth said of Walker's slow-paced moves.
   During the 25-minute performance, the 223-pound Walker,
appearing shirtless, often stood still or slowly walked through a
series of moves with Ms. Balogh, once lifting her 115-pound body
above his head and gently passing her over his back.
   ``The ballet depends upon extraordinary physical beings, but
this is even more extraordinary than one should expect,'' poet and
author William Burford of Fort Worth said of Walker's 50-inch chest
and 19{-inch neck. ``It's certainly not a ballet dancer's
physique.''
   The crowd, however, was filled with many who said they had never
attended a ballet, including many young boys who came to see their
football hero. Several rushed down darkened aisles toward the stage
when Walker first appeared and a crowd of children seeking
autographs crowded stage doors after the show.
   ``This was a wonderful gesture on Mr. Walker's part and he was
successful in bringing people out here today who wouldn't have
otherwise come to the ballet,'' Artistic Director Paul Mejia said.
   ``It was exactly what I wanted, and more,'' he said. ``I'm very
proud of Herschel for what he's done here.''
   Performing with a football player was not a new experience for
Mejia and the two dancers. All three were involved in the same
performance at the Chicago City Ballet with Chicago Bears wide
receiver Willie Gault.

   Customs agents Sunday seized nearly 2,000
pounds of cocaine and arrested the driver of a tractor-trailer rig
heading north from the Texas-Mexico border, authorities said.
   Agents removed 1,969 pounds of cocaine from the long-body
18-wheeler, Customs Service spokesman Charles Conroy said.
   The cocaine, with an estimated street value of more than $300
million, was hidden under a load of onions in the truck, said Mike
Cox of the Texas Department of Public Safety.
   DPS troopers and narcotics agents made the arrest with the
cooperation of federal agents, said Cox. The truck driver was
booked into the Brooks County jail in Falfurrias, he said, but
formal charges were not immediately filed.
   The seizure was part of an ongoing investigation, said Conroy,
adding more arrests were expected later in McAllen.
   Authorities seized 18,744 pounds of cocaine along the
U.S.-Mexican border in fiscal 1987, up from 3,975 in 1986,
according to Operation Alliance, a task force of local, state and
federal authorities in the Southwest border states.

   Officials issued a public health alert after two
families fell ill from eating cucumbers contaminated by aldicarb,
an illegal pesticide, authorities said. Cucumbers with the
pesticide may have been shipped to four states, they said.
   One case was reported in the Seattle area and one in the Renton
area south of Seattle, state Department of Social and Health
Services spokesman Frank Mendizabal said Saturday, the day the
alert was issued. He had no detail on the exact number of people
involved.
   Roger Lowell, district director for the federal Food and Drug
Administration in Seattle, said it is illegal to use aldicarb on
growing food products. But its effect on health is generally
temporary, he said Sunday.
   The thin cucumbers, 12 to 18 inches long and about 1{ inches in
diameter, were grown in hothouses in northern California by Barnard
Hydroponic of Redding, and distributed by Blue Anchor Inc., of
Sacramento, Lowell said.
   They were distributed by wholesale channels to both independent
and chain grocers in Washington and Oregon and maybe in northern
California and Idaho, Lowell said.
   One family's illness was reported about a week ago but couldn't
be traced to the cucumbers, Lowell said. The second family fell ill
Thursday, and laboratory tests confirmed ``high levels of
contamination with aldicarb,'' he said.
   In Oregon, there were no reports of illness, but state officials
also issued a public health alert Saturday. It warned that possibly
contaminated cucumbers had been distributed to groceries and
restaurants throughout the state by United Grocers Inc. and Pacific
Coast Fruit Co., said Dalton Hobbs, public information officer for
the state agriculture department.
   Bruce Barnard, an owner of Barnard Hydroponic, said Sunday that
he would not comment on the situation until he had had a chance to
talk with FDA officials. There was no answer at Blue Anchor on
Sunday.
   Symptoms of ingestion of aldicarb include nausea, vomiting and
diarrhea within one hour of eating, Lowell said. Other symptoms can
include blurred vision, excessive sweating and muscle twitching.
   Lowell said Sunday that officials are unaware of any permanent
health damage, adding that the symptoms pass quickly, like the flu.
In fact, he said, many people who may have gotten sick in the last
week may have thought they were suffering from the flu.
   Aldicarb is a treatment for soil before crops are grown and is
used mostly for non-food crops such as cotton. Lowell said aldicarb
is the same pesticide that contaminated watermelons distributed
along the West Coast two years ago.

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese III toured a
jungle valley Sunday that is the center of Peru's cocaine-producing
region.
   Meese arrived in Peru Saturday following visits to the Dominican
Republic, Colombia and Ecuador as part of a week-long tour of Latin
American nations to assess anti-drug trafficking operations.
   The attorney general, accompanied by U.S. and Peruvian
officials, flew from Lima to Tocache Sunday and toured the Huallaga
Valley before returning to the capital.
   Maoist Shining Path guerrillas have been providing protection
for drug traffickers in the valley for the past year, and about 10
months ago the rebels briefly controlled Tocache before police
drove them out. Tocache is 300 miles northeast of Lima.
   The Huallaga Valley on the jungle-cloaked slopes of the eastern
Andes is the major coca-leaf growing area in Peru. U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration officials say Peru is the world's
largest supplier of the leaves, the raw ingredient of pure cocaine.
   From a helicopter, Meese viewed a three-acre pilot project to
erradicate the coca plants through the use of herbicides. If
successful, the method could replace the tedious system of
uprooting the plants. Both erradication efforts are being funded by
Washington, according the U.S. embassy.
   The United States also is partially financing police operations
against drug traffickers in the zone, and recently loaned Peru
three privately rented helicopters for drug raids.
   Coca leaf in Peru is semiprocessed and flown to Colombia where
it is refined into pure cocaine.
   Meese is to meet Monday with President Alan Garcia and hold a
news conference before flying to Bolivia, where his tour will
conclude Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   A new British musical about Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr. received a six-minute standing ovation Sunday night at a
concert performance honoring the assassinated civil rights leader.
   Producers hoped the charity preview would generate support for a
commercial engagement of the play.
   ``I feel numb,'' Martin Smith, the composer-librettist of
``King,'' said following the audience response to his musical in
its premiere at the Prince Edward Theater.
   The musical, which portrays the life of the Nobel Prize-winning
black minister, began 20 minutes late because of a bomb scare. But
it proceeded without incident, except for some minor technical
mishaps with video projections.
   Smith, a 30-year-old Scot who started work on ``King'' five
years ago, said of the reception, ``It was wonderful. You couldn't
ask for more.''
   More than 60 percent of the tickets were sold for the
performance at the 1,616-seat theater.
   Obba Babatunde, a New Yorker who won a 1982 Tony Award for
``Dreamgirls,'' received the lion's share of the cheers for his
portrayal of the Dr. King, who was assassinated April 4, 1968, in
Memphis, Tennessee.
   The 75 cast members and 24 musicians worked without pay for the
concert, which was expected to raise $18,700 for two charities: the
Terence Higgins trust, devoted to AIDS research in Britain, and the
Save the Children Fund.
   Although reference was made to King's most celebrated speeches,
his actual words were not spoken on-stage in accordance with
copyright laws.
   Smith said the King family had instead given its approval to a
second English musical on the slain leader, which is due to be
produced on New York's Broadway within the year.

   The hijackers of a Kuwaiti jumbo jet
offered to trade passengers for fuel Sunday and threatened to crash
the aircraft into Kuwait's royal palace. They also warned of a
``slow and quiet massacre'' of their hostages if their demands were
not met.
   A flight engineer said the hijackers, who are demanding the
release of 17 pro-Iranian terrorists imprisoned in Kuwait, had
started to ``hurt'' one of the passengers.
   It is believed there are still 53 people aboard the Kuwait
Airways Boeing 747, including three members of Kuwait's ruling
Al-Sabah family and at least six hijackers.
   In Lebanon, a pro-Iranian group threatened to kill kidnapped
American and French hostages if any attempt was made to storm the
plane.
   A statement from the Islamic Jihad terrorist group was delivered
to the Reuters news agency in west Beirut, along with photographs
of journalists Terry A. Anderson, an American, and Jean-Paul
Kauffmann of France.
   ``To the families of the hostages, we declare that we shall
execute the Western captives in Lebanon if the plane and holy
warriors (hijackers) aboard are subjected to any military
foolhardiness,'' the statement said.
   In Cyprus, the Arab hijackers, who have killed one passenger
since seizing the plane Tuesday, threatened to kill their captives,
but a noon deadline passed without any additional slayings.
   One minute before a second deadline expired four hours later,
the engineer, relaying the hijackers' messages to Larnaca Airport
control tower, said: ``They've already started to hurt one of the
passengers.'' He gave no details.
   Later, the hijackers offered to free 20 of the passengers in
return for fuel, but that was rejected at Kuwait's insistence.
   Negotiators talked with the hijackers for 20 minutes late Sunday
and Cypriot government spokesman Akis Fantis said, ``There was an
important contact right now, and by tomorrow morning we shall know
the result that we would hope to be what we wish to have.''
   ``It's the same offer always, the release of the hostages for
fuel,'' he said. ``There is no change in the offer. We want the
hostages to be released, then we refuel. But there is a new
element, not changing the offer, but maybe changing their
attitudes. The element is good and gives a certain hope and that's
all.''
   Fantis did not elaborate and when asked about the mood of the
hijackers he said, ``They wished us a good night.'' He then was
asked about the possibility of police action and he replied, ``No
comment.''
   In a morning statement, one of the hijackers told the control
tower, ```We hereby re-announce our refueling request due to our
intention to (go to) Kuwait, the concerned country. And if Kuwait
refuses us, a crash landing will take place on the ... prince's
palace.''
   Speaking in broken English, he urged Cypriot authorities to send
fuel to prevent ``the slow and quiet massacre taking place in this
country.''
   Sunday night, the hijackers put on the radio a man they said was
Fadel Khaled Al-Sabah, a member of Kuwait's extensive ruling
family. In a faint voice, the man recited a verse from the Koran,
Islam's holy book, saying ``we depend on God for our fate.
   The tower asked: ``Is that it?'' One of the hijackers replied:
``Yes, that's it because he's sick.''
   The hijacker said the man could not hold down food and was
vomiting. Asked if a doctor was needed, the hijacker said he would
advise the tower Monday morning.
   Senior Palestine Liberation Organization officials in Cyprus met
with the hijackers four times Sunday. The PLO is believed to be a
key factor in negotiations.
   The plane landed in Larnaca on Friday. Flight 422 was
commandeered Tuesday en route to Kuwait from Bangkok with 112
people aboard and forced to land in Mashhad in northeastern Iran,
where 57 people were released.
   The jet left Iran and landed in Larnaca after being refused
permission to land in Lebanon and Syria. Another captive, an ailing
32-year-old Kuwaiti, was freed in Larnaca, apparently after PLO
intervention.
   On Saturday, the hijackers killed a 24-year-old Kuwaiti police
border guard aboard the plane. His body was tossed onto the tarmac
after the Cypriots refused to refuel the jet.
   Fantis said Sunday that marks on the man's body indicated he had
been badly beaten 18 to 24 hours before his death.
   Between meetings with PLO officials, several hijackers wearing
blue hoods ripped out inflatable orange escape chutes inside the
jet and dumped them on the tarmac.
   Then they demanded that ground staff remove the chutes so they
would not obstruct the plane.
   At 3 p.m., the engineer radioed the tower: ``If (the hijackers)
don't get a positive response in one hour and 15 minutes regarding
fuel and services, they will start hurting occupants of the
aircraft.'''
   When the tower urged the hijackers to free sick passengers, the
engineer replied: ``Negative.''
   One of the hijackers said they would release their captives
immediately if the 17 pro-Iranian extremists, convicted in Kuwait
for bombing the U.S. and French embassies there in December 1983,
were freed. Cypriot officials said the Kuwaitis refused.
   The nationalities and identities of the hijackers have not been
disclosed. Released passengers said they spoke Arabic with a
Lebanese accent.
   But their demand for the release of the 17 men, all but one
Shiite Moslems, imprisoned in Kuwait is identical to that made by
Shiite extremists holding two Americans and at least three
Frenchmen hostage in Lebanon.
   The American hostages are Anderson, 40, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, and Thomas Sutherland, 56,
acting dean of agriculture at the American University of Beirut.
Both were kidnapped in 1985 by the Islamic Jihad.
   The Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, is linked to Lebanon's
Hezbollah, or Party of God. The PLO is allied in Lebanon with
Hezbollah, a fundamentalist Shiite movement with strong links to
Iran's revolutionary government.

   Three people were stabbed to death Sunday
while a 98-year-old man slept a floor below, police said.
   A relative found the bodies of Dorothy Sewell, 64; her nephew,
Tyrone Mason, 33; and his 40-year-old girlfriend, whose name was
not released, on the second floor of the house about 10:30 a.m.,
police said.
   Repeated stab wounds and the disarray in the bedrooms indicated
the victims had struggled, said Sgt. Thomas Burke.
   Ms. Sewell's 98-year-old uncle, Harry M. Mandeville, slept
through the attack, which occurred after 4 a.m., Burke said.
   ``There was no sign of forced entry; nothing we know of at this
time was taken. We're still checking associates,'' he said, adding
that police had not established how many attackers might have been
involved or their motive.
   Neighbors said they had not seen or heard anything unusual.
   ``This has really got me shook up,'' said Nancy Martin, a
neighbor. ``This is a family street. People help each other out.
You see fights and stuff, but never anything like this.''

   Iran will defy a Saudi Arabian decree
calling for a reduction in the number of Moslems attending the
annual pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, Iran's official news
agency reported Sunday.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Hojatoleslam Mahdi
Karrubi, head of Iran's pilgrim organization, as saying this year's
pilgrimage will be conducted ``more splendidly than last year.''
   More than 400 pilgrims, including 275 Iranians, were killed by
Saudi count in clashes between Iranian demonstrators and Saudi
police during last year's pilgrimage to Mecca, Islam's holiest city.
   The clashes erupted when the Iranians staged political rallies
in defiance of a Saudi ban.
   Iran will send some 150,000 pilgrims to Mecca this year,
according to the news agency. That is the same number as last year.
The peak of the pilgrimage period is in July.
   The Saudis, whose relations with Iran deteriorated after last
year's violence, have asked all Moslem countries to reduce the
number of pilgrims they send this year to prevent disorders.
   Iran has called for the ouster of the Saudi royal family as
guardians of Islam's holy shrines.
   Relations have been strained between Iran and Saudi Arabia since
Persian Iran and Arab Iraq went to war in September 1980.

   Cold rain fell Sunday over the Ozarks of southwestern Missouri
and northwestern Arkansas, mixed wth snow at times at some of the
higher elevations. But high-temperature records were set in parts
of the West.
   A half-inch of snow accumulated on grassy areas in the
Berryville and Eureka Springs areas of Arkansas but streets and
highways were just wet.
   Rain also fell from western Arkansas into southeastern Texas,
with a few showers in western Kansas.
   Elsewhere, showers were widely scattered in Florida, and a
thunderstorm developed over Gainesville during the afternoon.
   Chilly weather prevailed over the Plains with afternoon
temperatures in the 40s and 50s from North Dakota to south-central
Texas. Frost was expected overnight in parts of Kansas.
   Casper, Wyo., had a record low of 18 degrees, but record highs
were posted in a number of cities farther West.
   Seattle posted a temperature of 74 degrees, 5 degrees above the
record set in 1978. Astoria, Ore., had a record high of 68 Sunday,
and in Olympia, Wash., it hit 77 degrees, breaking the 1942 record
by 3 degrees. The temperature in Reno, Nev., was 82, beating the
1949 record by 1 degree.
   California was sweltering. The mercury climbed to 91 degrees in
San Francisco, the warmest temperature in the entire month of April
in the 113 years records have been kept. The old record for an
April 10, set in 1904, was 84 degrees.
   ``It's hot, but it doesn't mean the world is coming to an end.
It could be a cool summer,'' said Dave Williamson, a National
Weather Service forecaster in Redwood City. ``But it looks like the
month of April is going to be an unusually warm month.''
   Records for the date were also set in Sacramento, 93 degrees;
Santa Rosa, 88 degrees; San Jose, 91 degrees; Oakland, 88 degrees;
Alameda, 88 degrees; Bakersfield, 95; and Fresno, 91.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 36
degrees at Fayetteville, Ark., to 92 at El Cajon, Calif. The
early-morning low for the day was zero at Yellowstone National
Park, Wyo.
   For Monday, rain was forecast in the Mississippi Valley, the
Gulf Coast and southern Atlantic Coast states, with a few
thunderstorms from Mississippi across Alabama to Georgia and
Florida. Light rain and drizzle were forecast for eastern New
England.
   Highs only in the 30s were predicted in northern Maine; in the
40s or 50s from the rest of New England across the Great Lakes
region and the entire Mississippi Valley to eastern sections of the
Plains; near 80 in southern Florida; in the 80s and 90s from the
desert Southwest to southern and interior sections of California;
and in the 60s or 70s across most of the rest of the nation.

   The Academy Awards ritual Monday night
features ``The Last Emperor'' as a shoo-in for best picture, but
for nominated performers it's a wide-open race in the Hollywood
tradition of nail-biting suspense thrillers.
   Will Cher's ``Moonstruck'' role win out over Holly Hunter's
``Broadcast News'' performance? Will Michael Douglas take the Oscar
for ``Wall Street,'' or will it go to Robin Williams for his ``Good
Morning, Vietnam'' performance?
   It really doesn't matter because the agenda for most others at
the show concerns career enhancement.

   It was bad enough when they convicted
Kermit's police chief for selling drugs and the fire chief for
setting fires, along with other members of their clan. Then the
former county sheriff admitted he sold his job to the highest
bidder.
   And last week, a special grand jury returned indictments
charging 16 of Mingo County's most prominent politicians _
including state legislators, a prosecutor and the mayor of the
county seat _ with bribery and conspiracy to subvert free elections
in Mingo County.
   The grand jury, one of three convened as part of a special state
and federal task force investigating corruption in the county, is
not yet finished. Circuit Judge Dan O'Hanlon, brought in from
another county, says the grand jury will remain empaneled through
July and will be in session on Election Day to hear any complaints
of vote fraud.

   In deciding to pursue a new courtship

nations as Mexico, Norway and China are ready for a historic shift
in global oil relations.
   At stake is the future direction of oil prices, which have
fallen steadily this year, partly due to increases in supply from
non-OPEC nations.
   Leaders of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
this week are inviting government representatives from at least
seven independent oil-producing nations to meet with five OPEC oil
ministers in Vienna, where OPEC keeps its headquarters, on April
23. All 13 OPEC members are to meet two days later.

   After years of silence and anti-Semitism,
Poland is re-evaluating its relationship to the Jews, once the
country's largest minority and now mostly a memory in abandoned
synagogues and forsaken graveyards.
   On April 14, Poles will begin a weeklong observance of the 45th
anniversary of the heroic rising of Warsaw Jews against the Nazi
occupiers.
   The commemoration, which will bring the largest delegation ever
from Israel, follows a rare public self-criticism issued last month
by Poland's communist party about anti-Semitic purges 20 years ago.

   Hundreds of specially trained black, Hispanic
and white couples will be sent out by the federal government to
pretend they want to buy or rent homes in the first major study of
housing discrimination in a decade.
   The study being announced on Monday will use the bogus house
hunters to look into more subtle forms of discrimination than any
previous study, said C. Duncan MacRae, Housing and Urban
Development deputy assistant secretary.
   MacRae said the study would spot blatant discrimination, but
also would try to measure practices such as ``steering,'' in which
a rental agency or realtor steers minority clients away from
all-white neighborhoods or into racially segregated neighborhoods.

to cut the Third World's trillion-dollar debt.
   The annual sessions at the headquarters of the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund likely will include discussions of
a number of proposals to deal with the huge debt of the Third World
countries, including one that would create about $29.5 billion in

   Officials agree that the Third World needs more money to
increase production of goods and provide more jobs so that its
people will have the money to buy the goods and improve their lives.

   The acquittals of white supremacist
leaders accused of plotting to overthrow the government poses a
dilemma for them and their followers: how to justify their
opposition to a government that treated them fairly.
   Some of those familiar with the movement say that Thursday's
verdict acquitting all 13 defendants of sedition and other charges
effectively neutralized the supremacists, whereas conviction would
have only made them martyrs.
   But others fear the verdicts by the all-white federal jury will
only encourage the extremists in their campaign of violence, aimed
particularly against blacks and Jews.

   When single people go to the clothing store,
who spends more money, men or women?
   The answer, investigators have discovered, is men.
   But skewing the findings is one group of men _ those age 55 to
64 _ who apparently are dedicating a good portion of their apparel
spending to gifts for women.
   ``Men aged 55 to 64 spent $1,128 a year on apparel and services
in 1984-85, compared with the $682 a year spent by the women in
that group,'' reported Stephanie Shipp in the April edition of
American Demographics magazine.

<HEAD>Ad Business Takes a Long Look at RJR Nabisco, Saatchi Flap</HEAD>
<HEAD>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</HEAD>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An advertising agency lost a longtime job
creating ads for a cookie and candy company last week, apparently
because it made a commercial for another client's new no-smoking
policy that angered the cookiemaker's bosses _ who also make
cigarettes.
   Officials at both the ad agency, Saatchi & Saatchi DFS Inc., and
the food and tobacco company, RJR Nabisco Inc., declined repeated
requests last week to discuss what led to the blowup, which ended
an 18-year relationship.
   RJR attributed the dismissal to ``philosophical differences.''
Saatchi said it was ``very saddened and disappointed'' by the
decision.
   But reports on the situation captivated both advertising
executives and those who follow the business for days.
   Some said the firing was unwarranted. Others called it an
understandable emotional reaction by a company facing growing
pressures from groups who want to outlaw some of its profitable
products.
   ``If I was RJR, I would have done the same thing,'' said George
Lois, chairman of Lois Pitts Gershon Pon-GGK in New York.
   ``RJR lives, breathes and exists on cigarettes. Here is an
agency that does a commercial that shows planeload of people
embarrassing a cigarette smoker. I can see the emotional reaction
that RJR had, and I don't think it's an irrational reaction. That's
how RJR exists,'' he said.
   The commercial at issue was an ad for Northwest Airlines that
showed passengers standing to applaud when informed that the
airline soon would ban smoking on nearly all its domestic flights.
   Others say the agency may have saved itself a lot of trouble if
only it had informed the tobacco company in advance of the
campaign. RJR Nabisco reportedly was upset partly because it wasn't
told about the imminent anti-smoking ads.
   One Saatchi executive, insisting on anonymity, said the agency
``should have thought it through more'' and informed RJR about its
involvement once the ads started running. But he indicated that
because the agency was admaker only for RJR Nabisco's cookie and
candy businesses _ not its tobacco products _ the logic of that
approach wasn't apparent at the time.
   It is not the first time an agency has upset one client by
taking on an assignment in an apparently unrelated area.
   Hallmark Cards Inc., for instance, changed ad agencies in 1984
after its old agency won the assignment of making commercials for a
long-distance telephone service. The Kansas City-based greeting
card maker felt the sentimental approach it took in selling its
cards was too similar to that taken by the phone company in selling
calls to family and friends.
   ``We were uncomfortable with a single agency doing both pieces
of work,'' said Steven Doyal, a spokesman for Hallmark. ``We were
not certain the agency could maintain the level of consistent
advertising excellence that both companies would want with the same
style of advertising.''
   One of the ironies in the RJR-Saatchi case is that the agency
did no cigarette advertising for RJR. In fact, Saatchi creates
commercials for True cigarettes, which are made by RJR rival
Lorillard Inc.
   ``We don't like that (Northwest) ad at all and we told them
so,'' said Sara Ridgway, a spokeswoman for Lorillard. ``But we did
not fire them. We didn't think it warranted firing them.''
   She said Lorillard has had a good relationship with the agency
since hiring it in 1980. The company thought about changing
agencies last year and invited several others to compete for the
True account but ultimately decided that Saatchi's work ``was the
best one for our product.''
   Steven A. Greyser, professor of marketing at the Harvard
Business School, said that is the way businesses should make
decisions.
   He said Saatchi's longevity in creating ads for RJR's Life
Savers candy for 18 years and its Nabisco cookies for 12 years
indicates the agency must have been doing its job.
   ``I see this as an inherently knee-jerk reaction by some people
who don't understand why they hired an advertising agency in the
first place _ to provide excellent advertising and good service,''
Greyser said.
   ``It was not a very smart thing to do,'' he said.

<HEAD>Grandson Of Tobacco Magnate Pushes Stop Smoking Kits</HEAD>

   Patrick Reynolds, grandson of tobacco magnate
R.J. Reynolds, is pouring his anti-smoking fervor into a
behavior-modification kit to help people kick the habit.
   Reynolds said in an interview Saturday he has set up
headquarters in Chicago for his business, the Reynolds Stop Smoking
Program, which sells kits bearing the same name.
   The kit, being test-marketed in 20 cities, contains audio
cassettes, a workbook and a 30-day supply of beta carotene, a
naturally occurring nutrient that some studies have suggested may
reduce lung cancer risk, he said.
   The kit is just the latest effort by Reynolds, 39, who has
become an increasingly active anti-smoking campaigner since he gave
up cigarettes four years ago. He has promoted his message in
television talk show appearances, letters to the president and in
congressional testimony.
   His efforts attracted the attention of the World Health
Organization, which honored Reynolds at a Washington ceremony
Friday along with other activists including Victoria Brynner,
daughter of lung cancer victim Yul Brynner, actor Larry Hagman and
former President Jimmy Carter.
   Reynolds' motive is a very personal one.
   ``My grandfather, R.J. Reynolds, helped popularize smoking in
America ... and I want to do everything I can, now that we know how
dangerous it is, to help people stop,'' he said Saturday.
   Reynolds said his only memories of his father, R.J. Reynolds
Jr., are ``of a man lying down gasping for breath.
   ``He died of emphysema at 58 ... caused by his cigarette habit,
when I was 15.''
   Though Reynolds took up the habit four years later, ``for the
usual reasons, wanting to attract older girls and so on,'' he
stopped in 1984 and became ``increasingly disturbed about what was
going on.
   ``And I found that cigarettes, for example, were the most
heavily advertised products in all of America. Tobacco companies
were spending over $2 billion a year advertising cigarettes. That
amounts to $8 a year for every man, woman and child in this
country.''
   Believing cigarette companies target their ads at the young,
Reynolds testified in 1986 before Congress in favor of a ban on all
cigarette advertising.
   He said he also has pushed for raising cigarette taxes, banning
smoking on airplanes and enacting tough clean indoor air laws, and
has endorsed a project to support product liability lawsuits
against tobacco companies.
   Calls to the Tobacco Institute in Washington on Sunday were not
answered. The tobacco industry claims no link between smoking and
disease has ever been proven.
   Reynolds' activities have drawn criticism from his siblings, who
have claimed his campaign is a publicity stunt. The tobacco heir
has just completed a book about his family, due out next year with
the tentative title, ``The Gilded Leaf: Three Generations of the
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and Fortune.''
   But Reynolds said he has given up his acting career, which
included a number of television appearances and the lead role in
the science fiction movie ``Eliminators,'' to devote all of his
time to anti-smoking activities.
   In his new venture, he said he has sold about 11,000 of his
behavior-modification kits at $19.88 each since he began marketing
them last Christmas through a toll-free telephone number advertised
on television. He also plans to market the kits to corporations and
hospitals.
   The man who inherited $2.5 million from his grandfather when he
turned 21 but later sold his stock in RJR Nabisco Inc., the
conglomerate that runs the family tobacco company, said he plans to
donate a substantial portion of the profit from the kits to the
American Lung Association, American Cancer Society and other
anti-smoking groups.
   Reynolds serves as a ``roving ambassador'' for the American Lung
Association, spokeswoman Elaine Chapnick said Sunday.
   But she said Reynolds' stop-smoking kit has not been evaluated
by the association, which sells its own kit containing a videotape,
audiotape and workbook for $59.95 through local lung associations.

<HEAD>$8.5 Million House Is Finished But Empty</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nothing burns in its 10 fireplaces, no glasses
clink at any of its five bars and its dog shower goes unoccupied.
   In fact, all 23,000 square feet of the newly completed, $8.5
million North Dallas mansion are empty and unused, except for an
occasional party designed to show the house off to prospective
buyers.
   The mansion on 1.5 acres in the prestigious Preston Hollow area
is believed to be the largest, most expensive ever built on
speculation in Dallas. It was completed last month but still does
not have an owner.
   But builder John Needham, who began the house more than two
years ago when the city's housing economy was near its peak, says
he believes there is a market for his seven-bedroom creation.
   ``There is an intense amount of interest in it. ... But it's
hard to say with a house of this magnitude,'' Needham said.
   The house does have magnitude.
   Needham was interviewed at a recent landscape lighting party
intended to highlight the five gardens around the mansion's
Olympic-size swimming pool and reflecting ponds.
   The largest of the seven bedrooms practically is a house in
itself: it's a two-level, 3,800 square-foot master suite with its
own small kitchen, his and hers bathrooms, a whirlpool, a sitting
area and dressing rooms. Upstairs is room for a desk plus several
sofas.
   The three-story building also includes a two-story library,
complete with a bar, reading rooms and a wine rack; a billiard room
and an exercise room, both accessible by elevator.
   Of course, the servants' quarters has its own staircase in back
so the help do not interrupt family suppers in the banquet hall or
a party centered around the grand saloon.
   The six-car garage has its own car wash so the chauffeur doesn't
have to wait in line at the car wash on a hot summer day.
   And then there's the ``doggy shower.'' It was included in the
large laundry room because there's never any place to wash the dog
in a house, explained Rona Victorson, the real estate agent
attempting to sell the mansion.
   Despite its price tag and size, Ms. Victorson and Needham say
the mansion is attracting prospective buyers.
   ``We've had people from out of town and Dallasites interested,''
Ms. Victorson said. ``I feel the large properties are now beginning
to sell.''
   When Needham began the house, the Dallas housing market was
riding a booming regional economy that was buoyed by sturdy oil
prices. Several large multimillion-dollar homes were sold before
they were completed, including the pink house down the street owned
by cosmetics magnate Mary Kay Ash.
   Although the subsequent oil slump hammered the real estate
market, Needham said the Dallas market is improving and at least
two other houses in a similar price range are being built.
   ``We feel very comfortable that the house is going to sell,''
Needham said. ``In light of today's market, we had to go ahead and
get it finished first. If the market had been better we could have
sold it with just the framing.''
   The house originally cost $7.5 million, but the price tag was
raised to $8.5 million after Needham decided to complete the house.
   Dr. Barbara Reagan, an economist at Southern Methodist
University, said a house that expensive would be more difficult to
sell, but not impossible in the improving area housing market.
   ``It's very location-specific, but it's perking up a little
bit,'' she said of the market. ``Some areas are holding up better
than others. We're kind of just bumping along.''
   Ms. Victorson said she never thought the Dallas housing market
was doing as poorly as some people perceived, but she acknowledged
interest in the house hasn't been as great as it might have been
several years ago.
   ``We've had certainly a sluggish economy,'' she said. ``But a
lot of the Dallas players that may have dropped out are back in
it.''

<HEAD>Marriott Latches On To Sports Bar Theme</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GINSBURG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hoping the American taste for the curve ball
and the drop kick survives longer than it did for singles bars and
discos, Marriott Corp. is spreading the sports bar theme at its
hotels and resorts.
   A new licensing agreement with Champions, a sports-oriented
restaurant and lounge chain, will bring the chain into as many as
18 Marriott hotels and resorts nationwide in 1988, according to
Bethesda, Md.-based Marriott.
   The agreement was made after a pilot test in Marriott's Copley
Place in Boston turned out to be a rousing success.
   ``We're doing double the business we did there before,'' said
Karl Kilburg, Marriott senior vice president of food and beverage
operations. ``It exceeded all our projections...we're very, very
satisfied, and we have great hopes for the future.''
   Champions Sports Inc., now a publicly-held corporation, began in
1983 as a sports bar in the affluent Georgetown section of
Washington. Owner Michael O'Haro had successfully operated a
singles bar in the late 1960s and a disco in the mid-70s, but
decided to strive for something that could stand the test of time.
   ``We looked all over and came to the conclusion that Americans
are interested in two things: religion and sports,'' O'Haro said.
``I couldn't see building a bar around religion, and to many sports
is religion.''
   O'Haro, aiming for more than just an establishment with a few
posters and a big-screen TV, decked the bar with sports
memorabilia, including a car that ran in the 1933 Indianapolis 500,
various team jerseys and thousands of baseball cards.
   ``From day one the bar has been has been a killer success,'' he
claimed.
   O'Haro opened a similar bar in suburban Falls Church, Va., and
in 1986 an outside group of investors joined him to license the
Champions name. They say they hit the jackpot with Marriott.
   ``I never thought it would get this big,'' O'Haro said. ``It
just happened, and the key was Marriott. That just set us apart,
that they would pick us from all the other sports bars in the
country.''
   Marriott liked the theme, and was convinced such establishments
would attract local sports fans as well as travelers.
   ``The whole concept is another way of meeting the needs and
expectations of our clients,'' said Marriott spokesman Nick Hill.
   ``Instead of ordering room service and sitting in front of the
TV, (a traveler) can go down and enjoy a drink and something to eat
without having to tolerate bright, swirling lights and loud
music,'' Hill said.
   Also, sports bars attract patrons of both sexes, contrary to
stereotypes that might indicate otherwise, said Andrew Oehmann,
chief executive of Champions.
   ``We have found that we get a lot of women in here,'' he said.
``I think it's because it's not threatening. It is not your typical
singles bar.''
   Marriott will pay Champions a fee of between $30,000 and $45,000
for each of the Champions restaurants it opens, plus a percentage
of the restaurants' sales.
   Champions helps design each new restaurant, provides up to 600
pieces of memorabilia from its stock of 8,000 items, sets up the
floor plan and trains the staff.
   Construction already is underway to build a Champions at the
Marriott in Tampa, Fla., and Kilburg said officials are pondering
Champions in Los Angeles, San Diego and Portland, Ore.
   ``If we continue to do well, we could continue to roll them
out,'' Kilburg said. ``Major cities or small towns, it doesn't
matter.''
   Kilburg thinks the format will be a lasting one.
   ``The decor is timeless,'' he said. ``...It seems that mixing
sports, food and drink is the right thing, and I think it will
still be the right thing 10 years down the road.''

<HEAD>Staley Continental Directors Considering Tate & Lyle Takeover
Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROLLING MEADOWS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Directors of Staley Continental
Inc., the nation's second-largest refiner of corn sweeteners, said
Sunday they are reviewing a $1.33 billion buyout offer made last
week.
   The statement came two days after Tate & Lyle PLC, a major
British sugar refiner and distributor, announced it was making a
cash tender offer for Staley.
   Tate and Lyle, which already owns nearly 5 percent of Staley's
stock, offered $32 a share for the rest of its 30.4 million
outstanding shares.
   Donald E. Nordlund, chairman and chief executive officer of
Staley, issued a brief statement Sunday that the board of directors
was consulting with its financial and legal advisers and expects to
advise shareholders of its position by April 21.
   Until then, the board was advising shareholders not to make any
decision whether to accept or reject the tender offer, Nordlund
stated.
   Staley climbed $5.87{ a share to $37.37{ in active trading
Friday on the New York Stock Exchange after the Tate & Lyle.
   The acquisition would give Tate & Lyle its first interest in the
U.S. corn sweetener market. Tate & Lyle said that if it acquired
Staley, it would become the only company producing all three types
of sugar _ corn, beet and cane _ in the United States.
   Staley Continental is a holding company formed in early 1985 for
the A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co., a leading corn processor, and
CFS Continental Inc., a food service supplier acquired in late 1984.
   Tate & Lyle said Staley is the second largest refiner of corn
sweeteners in the United States behind Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.,
based in Decatur, Ill.
   Staley's principal corn product is high fructose corn syrup,
known as HFCS. The company has around 25 percent of the $1 billion
a year U.S. market for HFCS sales, Tate & Lyle said.

<TEXT>
   The average retail price of gasoline rose by
more than a penny in the past two weeks, bringing the price even
with where it was a year ago, according to an industry survey
released Sunday.
   The price increase for all grades of gasoline was 1.18 cents a
gallon, pushing the average price to 96.14 cents a gallon in the
period ended April 8, according to the Lundberg Survey of gasoline
prices from stations around the United States.
   The increase followed a 0.78 cent a gallon decline in the
previous two-week period, but the average price was ``virtually the
exact same average price that Americans paid in April of 1987,''
analyst Trilby Lundberg said.
   According to the latest survey, prices per gallon at
self-service pumps were: regular unleaded, 86.80 cents; premium
unleaded, 101.84 cents; regular leaded, 83.97 cents.
   Prices at full-service pumps were: regular unleaded, 116.93
cents; premium unleaded, 127.20 cents; regular leaded, 112.51 cents.
   Although the previous period had seen a decline in the average,
which includes all grades, types of service and taxes, wholesale
price increases since then had prompted retailers to pass their
higher costs to consumers, Ms. Lundberg said.

<HEAD>Survey: Average Price Of ``Model'' Home Up 6.8 Percent In 1987</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The median price of a ``typical'' single-family
home rose by 5.6 percent in 1987, with prices of similar homes
rising in almost 86 percent of major North American markets during
that time, according to an industry survey.
   The survey conducted by Coldwell Banker Residential Group, the
real estate company owned by Sears Roebuck and Co., also indicated
the price of a similar single-family home in 172 markets ranged
from $66,833 in Oklahoma City to $636,667 in Beverly Hills, Calif.
   The survey released Monday reviewed sale prices of similar homes
in 168 U.S. and four Canadian markets in December 1987. Prices were
based on three recently sold homes in each markets.
   The model home was a single-family dwelling of about 2,000
square feet with three bedrooms, two baths, a family room or the
equivalent and a two-car garage. Homes selected had average age,
condition, curb appeal and location for a typical ``corporate
transferee'' neighborhood in each market, the survey indicated.
   Coldwell Banker said its Home Price Comparison Index indicated
the median home price rose 5.6 percent to $124,900 in December 1987
from a year earlier. The median is the price point where half of
the homes surveyed sold for less and half sold for more.
   It took an average of 77 days to sell a home in 1987, with
selling periods ranging from four days in the Washington, D.C. area
``inside the Beltway,'' or in the immediate metropolitan area, to
more than nine months in Fairbanks, Alaska, the survey indicated.
