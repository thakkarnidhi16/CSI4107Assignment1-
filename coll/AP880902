   Firefighters declared a temporary victory Friday in their battle
to keep a forest fire out of a small Montana town, and forest
officials warned that more lightning and dry, hot weather were
forecast this weekend.
   ``It's like sitting on a time bomb,'' said Scott Phillips,
recreation officer for the Sawtooth National Recreation Area in
central Idaho. ``If we can get through this weekend without a
conflagration, it will be a miracle.''
   Forests and rangeland burned Friday in parts of Wyoming,
especially in Yellowstone National Park, and in Idaho, Montana,
Oregon, Washington, Utah and California.
   The Boise Interagency Fire Center, the logistics command for the
national battle against forest fires, reported more than 25,000
firefighters, military and support personnel on the lines of more
than three dozen major fires in the West.
   Fire Center spokesman Arnold Hartigan called it ``the most
severe fire season in almost 30 years.'' More than 3.5 million
acres have burned, two-thirds of that in Alaska, and suppression
costs already exceed $250 million.
   ``The fire season is anything but over. ... The 30-day weather
forecast calls for continued unseasonably hot and dry weather for
the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies,'' Hartigan said. Record
highs were forecast during the weekend in Oregon and Washington,
with a threat of lightning.
   Forest Service officials asked people to stay out of forests in
central Montana and restrictions on such things as open campfires
were tightened in Idaho and Washington. Many forests in Oregon were
closed to recreational use.
   Logging activity was shut down statewide in Washington, on
public and private land, because of fire concern. The Weyerhaeuser
Co. closed all its timberlands to public access until further
notice.
   The focus of attention Friday in and around Yellowstone, where
some 550,000 acres have been charred, was the small town of West
Yellowstone, Mont., just outside the park's west entrance. It was
threatened by flames just over a mile away that were spreading from
the 118,000-acre North Fork fire inside the park that had grown by
nearly 10,000 acres since Thursday morning.
   Bulldozers, helicopters and back fires stalled the advance of
the fire Friday. But gusty winds swept a swath of flame south of
the town and a wind change predicted for Monday raised concerns the
blaze could move back toward the community.
   ``In my judgment this community is very defensible,'' Denny
Bungartz, the North Fork fire's incident commander, told about 60
townspeople.
   He said firetrucks had pumped 5,000 gallons of water into dry
brush around a warehouse at the park boundary, and 50 fire engines
would be in town during the night to hose down buildings if
necessary.
   To the east and north of town, the Madison River formed a
natural fire break. Firefighters improved on that barrier by
bulldozing fire lines and lighting backfires, exhausting the
forest's fuel before the main fire could reach the river, as
helicopters dropped water on the area.
   Residents of the small town, with a year-round population of
750, prepared to evacuate but most stayed put Friday. Most of the
people leaving town were tourists who decided to spend their Labor
Day weekend somewhere less smoky.
   Curious onlookers filled the streets Friday as afternoon winds
blew away the smoky haze.
   ``I'm packed up and ready to go,'' said David Powell, owner of a
hamburger stand downtown. ``I left L.A because I couldn't stand the
smog. I don't like this stuff.''
   Some people were driving in the other direction, because West
Yellowstone will play host to hundreds of square dancers this
weekend for the Knothead Jamboree. Resident dance caller Orvile
Pittam says it's been sponsored by square dance groups in Utah,
Idaho, Wyoming and Montana every Labor Day weekend for 37 years and
attracts up to 800 people.
   Ken Takata, West Yellowstone Chamber of Commerce president, said
that while there have been some cancellations because of the fires,
it's too early to tell what the overall effect will be.
   ``We want people to know that right now conditions are pretty
good,'' he said Friday. ``We've had some bad press that West
Yellowstone is being evacuated, and that's just not the case. We
hope it will be business as usual.''
   Elsewhere in Yellowstone, the Clover Mist fire had covered
232,400 acres after growing 1,000 acres in 24 hours, the Snake
River complex of fires was stable at about 156,500 acres and the
Wolf Lake fire grew slightly to 40,500 acres, said fire information
officer Brian Morris.
   North of Yellowstone in south-central Montana, firefighters in
the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness changed their tactics Friday on a
49,800-acre wilderness fire that jumped fire lines four days in a
row.
   Fire information officer Chris Comstock said Friday that
officals changed their strategy from building fire lines to setting
backfires because ``our method of approach right now hasn't been
effective in catching this fire.''
   Fire bosses in Idaho used a second day of light wind to gain
more ground against the worst of Idaho's 17 wildfires, with more
than 3,000 firefighter and support personnel still battling fires
that had burned more than 75,000 acres.
   Only the 40,300-acre Tepee Butte fire remained out of control in
Oregon, in the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest and the Hell's
Canyon National Recreation Area. It was 25 percent contained
Friday, officials said.
   By Friday, fires that raged through tinder-dry California
forests were dying down, with all reported contained or under
control.
   A new forest fire near Salt Lake City forced the evacuation of a
few homes on Friday. The state's largest fire was a 2,000-acre
blaze fanned by ridgetop winds near northern Utah's Pineview
Reservoir.
   The fire was initially declared under control late Tuesday at
525 acres but roared to life again late Wednesday when gusts fanned
hot spots and pushed flames over fire lines.

<HEAD>Ex-Government Whistleblower Awarded $560,000 in Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government has agreed to pay
$560,000 to settle its dispute with a senior employee who was fired
five years ago after warning of hazardous conditions in major
government buildings, his attorney said late Friday.
   The General Services Administration agreed to the payment to
settle its dispute with Bertrand G. Berube, with the bulk of the
money representing back pay and interest, said Louis Clark, an
attorney for Berube and director of the Government Accountability
Project.
   The GSA in July had been ordered by the Merit Systems Protection
Board to reinstate Berube to his former post as the GSA's
Washington area regional director and to pay him back wages and
legal fees.
   Under terms of the settlement, Berube will receive $530,000, of
which $181,000 will go for attorney's fees. In addition, the GSA
will pay $24,000 into his retirement account, and $6,000 for
unemployment compensation Berube otherwise would have to repay,
Clark said.
   Berube also was offered a position as deputy administrator in
the GSA's Philadelphia area office, but opted to retire now, at age
55. He will be allowed to begin drawing a full pension of $32,500 a
year immediately.
   Clark said was Berube was pleased with the settlement, but would
rather have had his job back in Washington. Someone else has the
job now, and Berube opted to settle rather than go through
additional years of litigation for Berube to regain the position,
Clark said.
   GSA spokesman Paul Costello confirmed that the agency has agreed
to five the Government Accounting Project, which championed
Berube's case, a check for $530,000 to settle the dispute, The
Washington Post reported in Saturday's editions.
   Overall, Berube can be expected to receive $440,000 in back pay
and benefits over his lifetime that he would not have received
without the settlement.
   At the time of his firing, Berube oversaw 7,000 employees in the
Washington area and a budget of $2 billion. He was in charge of
maintaining virtually every government building in Washington.
   Berube was dismissed after he alleged that many federal
buildings in Washington posed serious fire and health hazards and
that maintenance was deferred to save money.

   Hurricane Debby lashed this Gulf of Mexico
port city Friday with heavy rain and winds gusting up to 74 mph,
knocking out power, flooding streets and forcing some people to
flee their homes.
   But the first hurricane of the 1988 Atlantic season began
weakening shortly after hitting the coast and was downgraded to a
tropical storm.
   The National Weather Service in Mexico City said Debby moved
inland at Tuxpan, a city of 120,000 about 165 miles northeast of
Mexico City, at 4 p.m. (6 p.m. EDT). It said at that time the storm
was carrying winds up to 74 mph, the minimum strength to be
classified as a hurricane.
   The service downgraded Debby to tropical-storm status after its
center stalled on reaching the eastern Sierra Madre mountain range
50 miles inland about 7:30 p.m., with maximum winds of 49 mph.
Heavy rains were falling in parts of Veracruz and Tamaulipas states.
   ``We can say the storm is becoming disorganized,'' a weather
service spokesman said. ``By morning maximum winds should be around
30 mph and the storm should disappear by Saturday night.''
   The storm caused power outages in Tuxpan and Poza Rica, about 20
miles to the south, and dozens of people were evacuated from
low-lying areas in the two cities and near the Tuxpan and Tecolutla
rivers.
   ``The rains have calmed somewhat, but the winds are strong,''
said Red Cross worker Francisco Javier Cruz Balderas. ``Many
streets are inundated, and the rivers are rising fast.''
   Hundreds of people sought refuge in schools and municipal
offices in Alamo, a coffee-producing town about 20 miles west of
Tuxpan, said Roberto Martinez, editor of the newspaper El Mundo of
Tampico.
   Dozens of residents had to be rescued from cars and flooded
homes in Poza Rica, a city of 300,000. Authorities closed streets
in some sections of the city because of flooding.
   ``The situation is bad enough, but not desperate,'' said Red
Cross spokesman Alan Garcia in Poza Rica.
   ``A lot of trash in the streets and tree trunks are blocking
runoff,'' he said. ``Even we can't get out _ we're trapped.''
   He said several dozen residents of low-lying areas in the city
were evacuated to higher ground but he couldn't give a figure as to
how many people were affected.
   Martinez said there were power outages throughout the northern
Veracruz coastline and that some local roads were cut off by
flooding. Residents of Tampico and other cities in southern
Tamaulipas state were bracing for heavy rains, he said.
   ``There was a lot of panic buying in supermarkets here, but so
far there haven't been any problems,'' Martinez said.
   Guadalupe Lopez, a spokeswoman with the Veracruz state
government in Jalapa, said she could provide no figures on how many
people were affected by the storm and that officials had no
estimate of damages. There were no reports of deaths or injuries,
she said.
   Although the national weather services in Miami and Mexico City
said Debby was carrying winds of 74 mph, the Mexican navy station
and port authority in Tuxpan said it did not have hurricane
strength.
   Navy Capt. Domingo Rojas Cadenas said his reports showed Debby
carrying winds of 50 mph and gusts of up to 62 mph when it reached
Tuxpan. ``There is heavy rain now'' he said late Friday, but the
storm had not caused any major problems.
   Debby grew from a depression into a tropical storm early Friday
and then quickly gathered strength, becoming a hurricane by
afternoon when it was just off the coast.
   It was the first hurricane of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season
and the fourth named storm.

   A sculpture garden where visitors touch,
climb on and lie down in statues worth millions of dollars attracts
those who rarely visit museums.
   The Minneapolis Sculpture Garden, being formally dedicated
Saturday, is on 7{ acres of downtown city parkland and is the
largest urban sculpture garden in the country, city and museum
officials say.
   It features a giant cherry in a spoon by Claes Oldenburg, and
sculptures by other such masters as Isamu Noguchi and Henry Moore.
   ``I see children playing around and among the sculptures. They
become active participants like you probably couldn't have in a
museum,'' said David Fisher, superintendent of the Minneapolis Park
and Recreation Board.
   The $12.8 million joint project of Walker Art Center, the park
board and the University of Minnesota's Landscape Arboretum
provides hands-on experience for adults, too, with its 40
sculptures.
   Visitors, who have been allowed in during the two years the
project has been in development, can swing on a platform suspended
from the large, steel-beamed sculpture ``Arikidea'' by Mark di
Suvero, watching the beams overhead shift slowly from the motion of
the swing.
   They can lie on their backs in the aluminum human form that
faces the sky and become part of Peter Shelton's
``BLACKVAULTfalloffstone.''
   Or they can step inside Meg Webster's ``Glen,'' a plant-filled
earthen crater, and enjoy the scents and colors of perennial plants
and wildflowers.
   ``The interaction has been one of the bigger things that we've
pulled off,'' Fisher said. ``To watch the pure joy of some people
in their interactions has been a real delight to me.''
   The sculptures date from early in the century to the present,
and range in style from classical realism to elemental abstractism.
They were created by artists working in a variety of media,
including bronze, stone and wood.
   Permanent installations represent such acknowledged masters as
Henry Moore, Reuben Nakian and Isamu Noguchi, as well as leading
contemporaries such as Deborah Butterfield, Ellsworth Kelly and
George Segal.
   The garden, designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes in association
with landscape architect Peter Rotschild, is largely symmetrical.
Four 100-foot-square plazas are separated by walkways lined with
linden trees. The more traditional sculptures are placed among the
trees along the walkways, with the larger constructions inside the
plazas.
   The garden's focal point is the $500,000 fountain sculpture
``Spoonbridge and Cherry'' by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van
Brugggen.
   The giant gray aluminum spoon holding a deep red bing cherry
with a black stem arches from the reed and iris-lined shore to an
island in a free-form pond, giving off a glistening mist and adding
a touch of fantasy to the garden.
   The Sage and John Cowles Conservatory is a series of three
connected glass houses that feature permanent and seasonal
horticultural displays.
   One exhibit contains a dozen palm trees that rise nearly 60 feet
high looming over Frank Gehry's 22-foot-high sculpture ``Standing
Glass Fish'' which rises from a pool of white water lilies.
   A footbridge designed by artist Siah Armajani spans city traffic
to link the garden to Loring Park and the downtown area.
   One of the major goals of the sculpture garden, said Walker Art
Center director Martin Friedman, is to develop an appreciative
audience by making as much good work available as possible.
   The garden is meant to attract art lovers as well as people who
don't normally frequent museums. Friedman said he hopes it will
help dispell the perception that a museum is ``a somewhat remote
presence, even a fortress of art.''

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The guards at the U.S. Embassy, on alert for
suicide car bombers and other terrorists, were perplexed this week
when a pickup truck approached the iron gate with a pink-ribboned
camel peering from the rear.
   They stopped the driver and shouted at him in Arabic: ``It's
forbidden! It's forbidden!''
   After a few minutes of negotiations, the heavy gate swung open
and in came Jimmy Carter's camel _ an example of southern (Egypt)
hospitality.
   The saga began the weekend of Aug. 17, when Egyptian officials
telephoned wealthy camel trader Abdel-Wahab Waguih and told him the
former U.S. president and his wife, Rosalynn, would be visiting
suburban Cairo's sprawling camel market.
   The Carters and seven relatives arrived Aug. 18 for a two-day
private visit to cap an African tour. A U.S. Embassy spokesman said
Mrs. Carter specifically selected the camel market for sightseeing
along with the Giza pyramids and the Sphinx.
   At the market, in the suburb of Imbaba, traders noisily bargain
to sell camels earlier bought from Sudanese owners, who trek with
the animals for about 40 days across Sudan's desert before bringing
them by train from southern Egypt to Imbaba. Once sold, the animals
are used as a beasts of burden or are slaughtered for meat.
   Waguih was instructed to show the Carters around and give them a
flavor of Egyptian business.
   But he also gave the Carters two silver daggers, a bunch of
genuine Sudanese camel whips _ and the 6-year-old camel, a pink
ribbon tied around his neck, worth between $560 and $740.
   He said his gift-giving was typical of ``Saeedi'' _ the
hospitality shown by people from southern Egypt.
   His generosity went so far as wanting to honor his guests by
slaughtering a sheep at Carter's feet, a traditional Moslem act of
welcome, ``but the American Embassy people told me not to,'' he
said. ``Carter wouldn't like it.''
   Although he accepted the huge animal, Carter told the embassy he
couldn't take it home to Plains, Ga., and instead wanted to give it
to Sister Emmanuelle, a French nun who works with Cairo's garbage
collectors, the zabaleen.
   Nobody came to pick up the beast for 10 days, and Waguih said he
became impatient.
   ``I took it to the embassy in a van. There were guards at the
door, but I don't care, I'm not afraid,'' he said, recounting the
Monday incident at the embassy as he sat outside his office at the
market with 10 relatives.
   An embassy official signed a receipt for the camel and
dispatched an Egyptian employee with Wagih to deliver it to
al-Muqattam mountain, where thousands of zabaleen live and where
Sister Emmanuelle has set up a school, a health center and a
veterinary clinic.
   ``The camel is now out of our hands,'' said the embassy
spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``It's up to Sister
Emmanuelle to decide what to do with it, to sell it or have it
slaughtered for meat.''
   The Roman Catholic nun had no comment except ``I still don't
know'' the camel's fate.
   For the zabaleen, accustomed to donkeys, pigs and sheep, the
camel provided a spectacle but not much enthusiasm _ or appetite.
   ``We aren't used to eating camel meat in this area,'' said Yanni
Rizk, a worker at the nearby Cairo slaughterhouse, explaining it is
an area without camel butchers.
   ``It's a joke,'' said Sister Juliana, an Egyptian nun who helps
Sister Emmanuelle at her health center. ``They'll probably sell it
and put the money into the vet center. Otherwise, the camel
requires money for food and care, and we have no place to keep it.''
   The beast, meanwhile, stands waiting in the vet center
courtyard, the pink ribbon still around its neck.

<TEXT>
   The expatriate daughter of a near
legendary hero assassinated 40 years ago is helping to unify vast
but potentially chaotic anti-government forces in Burma.
   Aung San, leader of Burma's independence struggle, was gunned
down at the age of 32 _ before, as many have suggested, the world
of workaday politicking he was about to enter could mar his image.
   Some media reports have compared his daughter, Aung San Suu Kyi,
with Philippine President Corazon Aquino and Benazir Bhutto of
Pakistan _ women from nationally prominent families who led or lead
opposition forces.
   The 43-year-old daughter last week drew crowds of up to 400,000
to hear her call for democracy after 26 years of authoritarian
rule. Some diplomats and Burmese analysts believe she will be only
a transitional figure, but one who could help unify disparate
groups and prevent a plunge into anarchy.
   Aung San's daughter was thrust unwittingly into the political
arena after coming to Rangoon from her home in England in April to
care for her ailing mother.
   ``She saw all the commotion and turmoil, the rioting and
demonstrators getting killed,'' said Burmese emigre spokesman Max
McGrath in London. ``She must have been affected emotionally,
especially when demonstrators carried pictures of her father at the
head of the procession.''
   In an interview with a British television network last week, she
said she had no plans for a new political party or an immediate
blueprint for a future Burma beyond an interim People's
Consultative Committee leading to democracy.
   If her program sounded vague, her presence stirred strong
emotions.
   ``It's like if George Washington's son had come along in 1830
and said, `I'd like to be president of the United Stats.' It would
have a certain ring to it,'' says British Burma expert Robert H.
Taylor.
   Like Washington, whose name Aung San used to invoke, the Burmese
leader fought for independence from Britain. Sealing their vow to
liberate Burma in blood, he and the so-called ``Thirty Comrades''
marched into their homeland during World War II, attacking first
the Allies and then the Japanese.
   Contemporaries recall Aung San as a compelling personality, a
sincere, highly principled and simple-living man who could mix
easily with colleagues and then lapse into periods of brooding
silence.
   After the war he negotiated successfully with the British
government for independence. But months before it was granted, the
youthful, handsome Aung San and half a dozen other leaders were
killed when assassins of a political opponent burst into a Cabinet
meeting with automatic rifles blazing. His death on July 19, 1947,
is still commemorated as Martyr's Day.
   Aung San Suu Kyi was barely 2 years old when her father died.
She was educated in Burma and India, where he mother served as
ambassador from 1960 to 1967.
   She obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from Oxford University in
1967, worked at the United Nations headquarters in New York and in
1972 married Michael Aris, an Oxford professor and expert on
Tibetan culture and the Himalayan region.
   Although she accompanied her husband on long research stints to
Bhutan, Nepal, Japan and other Asian countries, acquaintances say
she did not pursue a career after marriage.
   The demonstrations against a quarter century of oppressive rule
ended the calm of her private life. Some Burmese also called for
the return of her brother, Aung San Oo, a 45-year-old American
citizen living in the United States.
   Despite the rousing welcome for Aung San Suu Kyi, ``I think
people are beginning to have some questions about her,'' said a
Western diplomat in Rangoon. ``She's really an expatriate with no
political experience.''
   But in a BBC interview she countered this by saying, ``I have
never been away. ... In my thoughts, I have never been away from my
country and my people. In my heart, also i have never been
seperated from them.''
   She and her husband, who is with her in Rangoon along with their
two sons, regularly visited Burma during the Ne Win period. Rather
than an emigre opposition figure, she was allowed to return home at
the price of keeping an apolitical silence about conditions in her
country, Burmese emigres say.
   Some Burmese believe her marriage to a foreigner would not be
well accepted by many in the inward-looking nation.
   It also is unclear whether she has any formal political
ambitions, although last week she appeared to be thinking about a
future in Burma.
   ``The Burmese people love my father very much and I think they
are ready to support me because I'm my father's daughter,'' she
said.

   Days before he was shot to
death in January, 16-year-old Rabeh Mahmoud told his family he
wanted to give his life for the Palestinian cause, his sister,
Sabah, recalls.
   Mahmoud is one of 53 youths under age 18 who have been kille
during the 8-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip. They comprise about a fourth of the deaths
from Israeli army gunfire. Thousands of other youths have been
wounded.
   TV viewers worldwide have seen the young Palestinian boys in
kafiyeh headdresses throwing rocks at troops, then running as
soldiers respond with tear gas and bullets.
   Israeli military officials allege the youths are placed in the
front lines of protests to generate world sympathy and portray
Israeli occupation troops as ruthless soldiers who do not hesitate
to shoot children.
   ``Children are weapons in this war. It is very sinister,'' said
Col. Renaan Gissin, the army's deputy spokesman.
   ``With children up front, they (Palestinian leaders) win either
way _ whether our soldiers refrain from shooting because of strict
orders to avoid hurting children, or if they open fire, the
Palestinians win the war for the media,'' Gissin said. ``They make
sure the picture of the dead child makes it to the papers.''
   But the youngsters, encountered in refugee camps throwing rocks
at soldiers not much older than themselves, say they are the
leaders of the revolt.
   They have become known as the ``children of the stones'' after a
poem by Syrian writer Nizar Qabani. The Palestine Liberation
Organization has made posters of youngsters holding firebombs.
Palestinians call children who are killed ``martyrs,'' not
``victims.''
   Sabah Mahmoud, the sister of slain 16-year-old Rabeh, says her
father now is worried about about his 13-year-old son, who is often
out in the streets with friends. The father cries whenever soldiers
pass their house, she said.
   ``When Rabeh told my father he wanted to die for Palestine, we
thought he was joking,'' Sabah said, sitting below a gold-framed
portrait of her dead brother, the only picture on the walls of the
Beitin village farmhouse not far from Ramallah.
   United Nations casualty lists, updated as of Aug. 12, show 202
Palestinians killed by Israeli army gunfire. Of these 53 are 18 or
younger, with 18 under 16 years old and six who were below 14.
   The youngest casualty listed by the U.N. was a 9-year-old girl,
but the army said she was killed by a rock thrown by a Palestinian.
The army, whose death figures differ only slightly from U.N. ones,
does not give breakdowns by age.
   The U.N. count shows three other Arab youths under 18, including
a 12-year-old, were shot to death by Jewish settlers. A 14- and
17-year-old were beaten to death by troops, the U.N. says.
   An official of an international relief organization, speaking on
conditoin of anonymity, estimated at least 8,000 youngster have
been wounded by bullets, beatings, tear gas or rubber bullets.
   Israeli youths aren't directly involved in the protests, but
they are among civilians injured by rocks and firebombs hurled at
cars. The army lists 312 such casualties but has no breakdown by
age.
   A Jewish girl, 15-year-old Tirza Porat, was shot to death
accidentally by an armed escort in the West Bank in April when a
group of Jewish hikers clashed with Arab villagers. Police are
investigating whether an 8-year-old boy slain August 27 near Haifa
was killed by Palestinians.
   One reason Palestinian youngsters are so involved in protests is
demographic: Almost 50 percent of the population of the occupied
territories is 17 or younger, according to the West Bank Data
Project research foundation.
   These are youngsters raised under the military rule Israel has
maintained over the West Bank and Gaza Strip since the territories
were captured from Jordan and Egypt in 1967.
   Analysts say the young have become radicalized and are rebelling
against Israel and the traditional leadership of their elders,
which failed to secure an independent state.
   ``It's a schoolyard revolution,'' said Bernard Mills, a U.N.
Relief Works Agency official in the occupied Gaza Strip. ``Even
before the uprising, by March of 1987, if you were over 14 years
old and hadn't been arrested by the Israelis, you hadn't got your
school letter, to put it in American terms.''
   Young people 18 to 25 are emerging as the new generation of
leaders, and their younger siblings are followers and would-be
successors, military sources said.
   ``Like the Americans of the 1960s who said, `Don't trust anyone
over 30,' they are saying `Don't trust anyone over 25,''' Gissin
said.
   The Israeli army recently introduced plastic bullets in a move
it says is intended to cut casualties. The army says its soldiers
have orders not to open fire at children, but occupation rules
consider those over age 14 accountable for their actions.
   Chris George, an official of Save The Children, an American
relief organization, said the army should respect children's status
as minors.
   ``Even if a kid is involved in a confrontation _ throwing a rock
for example _ there is no justification for a well-equipped army to
use lethal force,'' George said.

   The Navy is planning a
low-key welcome for the refitted USS Stark when it returns home
Saturday, ready for duty almost 16 months after being heavily
damaged by Iraqi missiles.
   Lt. Cmdr. Tim Taylor, a Navy spokesman, said the Stark will be
greeted by family members of the crew and local Navy officials
``but there will be no formal ceremonies.''
   ``It is planned as the routine return of a ship from an overhaul
period,'' said Taylor.
   The guided-missile frigate has been in Ingalls Shipbuilding yard
in Pascagoula, Miss., for the past nine months to repair the
missile damage that left 37 crew members dead in May 1987.
   The job was completed on time and was $52 million less than the
estimate, Navy officials said.
   The government of Iraq has promised to pay the costs of
repairing the ship and to compensate the families of those killed
during the attack. It will be presented a bill for the repairs.

   Half the city's taxis and privately owned
cars were banned from the Athens area for a second straight day in
an effort to dispel record levels of smog.
   The government said emergency measures would be dropped today
because of a substantive drop in pollution levels.
   The state-run National Center for Emergency Aid said 92 people
with pollution-caused heart and respiratory problems sought
treatment Thursday at clinics in the Greek capital. Another 24 were
hospitalized, the center said.
   The Panhellenic Center for Ecological Studies, a private

hospital treatment.
   ``There was a temperature inversion that got really bad
Wednesday. It was like having a lid over Athens that kept the
pollution trapped underneath,'' said Dimitris Hadjidakis of the
Government Program for Pollution Control.
   About 15,000 taxis and half the city's 730,000 private cars were
banned from a 155-square-mile area, and Athens' 120 biggest
factories were told to reduce output by 30 percent during the
emergency.

Slaying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parents of a high school student
convicted of murdering his classmate have decided not to take part
in a movie about the slaying, spurning a $35,000 offer that will go
to the victim's mother, a newspaper reported.
   The movie will be dedicated to the memory of Shaun Ouillette,
who was a 15-year-old freshman at Canton High School when he was
beaten to death with a baseball bat in 1986, said Dennis Bogorad of
Dave Bell Associates, a Hollywood-based production company.
   Rod Matthews, also 15, was convicted in March of second-degree
murder in the slaying of his classmate.
   ``They (Matthew's parents) have no interest in the movie,'' a
family friend, Mel Ginsberg, told The Patriot Ledger of Quincy.
``They're not going to make it. They didn't sign anything. Mr. and
Mrs. Matthews are not out to capitalize on this.''
   ``They're just an average family and they don't want any more
damage done,'' Ginsberg said.
   He said the Matthews were upset when Ouillette's mother, Jeanne
Quinn, accused them on Geraldo Rivera's national television talk
show of accepting ``blood money'' and trying to capitalize on the
crime.
   Kenneth and Janice Matthews had planned to donate a $35,000
payment from the movie production company plus a share of the
profits to a psychiatric clinic where their son was held prior to
his trial in March, the newspaper reported Thursday.
   The family decided to forego the fee when it learned that
Ouillette's estate could sue to obtain the profits within three
years.
   Quinn said she has agreed to help make the movie and will
receive the $35,000 payment. She has said she is participating to
guarantee events surrounding her son's death are accurately
portrayed.
   Matthews was sentenced to life in prison and is eligible for
parole in 2001.

honored with the dedication of a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
   About 200 people, including the singer's brother, Johnny,

Hollywood Chamber of Commerce spokeswoman Ana Martinez.
   Gwendolyn Lightner, Jackson's pianist for the last six years of
her life, also came to the ceremony on Hollywood Boulevard.
   Jackson, who died in 1972 at age 60, sold millions of records
during a recording career that began in 1934 and included such
songs as ``Move On Up A Little Higher'' and ``He's Got The Whole
World In His Hands.''
   Stars are awarded by the Chamber of Commerce through an
application process and for a fee of $3,500. Jackson's estate paid
the fee, Ms. Martinez said.

<HEAD>Judge Reportedly Dismisses Engineer's Suits Against Morton Thiokol</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has dismissed two
multibillion-dollar lawsuits filed against Morton Thiokol by a
former engineer who warned against the disastrous launch of the
space shuttle Challenger, a lawyer said Thursday.
   Robert Levin, attorney for former rocket engineer Roger
Boisjoly, told KSL-TV that he learned Thursday afternoon that U.S.
District Judge David K. Winder had dismissed the $3 billion suits
with prejudice, meaning they cannot be refiled.
   Court documents were expected to be made public Friday morning.
   The judge had taken the matter under advisement in February
following a hearing on the company's motion to quash the suits.
   One of Boisjoly's suits had sought $1 billion for the deaths of
the seven Challenger crew members on Jan. 28, 1986, and $1 million
in compensatory damages for his own health and career.
   Boisjoly, who this year won the Scientific Freedom and
Responsibility Award from the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, contended Morton Thiokol impugned his
professional reputation after he and other engineers testified
before a presidential commission investigating the Challenger
explosion. The engineers testified that they had warned against
launching the shuttle in the unusually cool weather.
   His other lawsuit, filed under the False Claims Act on behalf of
U.S. taxpayers, sought $2.075 billion and alleged that Morton
Thiokol knowingly provided the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration with defective solid rocket motors.
   Morton Thiokol spokesman Rocky Raab said the company had
received no official notification of the decision.
   ``But if, in fact, it does prove to be true, it does vindicate
what we've said all along. It repudiates what the claims were about
Challenger that he (Boisjoly) made,'' he said.
   ``Most of all, we're just glad to see that it's over with,''
Raab said.
   Company attorneys had said Boisjoly's assertion that he was
defamed was based on office chatter.
   ``It is just workplace-related talk that goes on all the time,''
attorney Robert Jordan told the judge during February's hearing.
   However, Levin accused company officials of having launched a
campaign to defame the engineer through pamphlets and interviews,
``not coffee-shop stuff.''
   In a May interview, Boisjoly said only after two years of
therapy and ``the positive catharsis'' of giving lectures on the
disaster was he able to stop blaming himself for the destruction of
the shuttle and deaths of the astronauts.
   Boisjoly and several other Morton Thiokol engineers had argued
the night before the launch that temperatures of 53 degrees
Fahrenheit or less could result in a failure of a rocket joint seal.
   But after a second caucus with NASA officials, Boisjoly said,
company managers ``perceived pressure from NASA ... there was no
other justification for the launch. I felt the pressure, others
felt the pressure.''
   He took disability leave July 21, 1986, and left the company for
good two months later.
   The Rogers Commission investigating the explosion later blamed
the disaster on a leaking joint seal that allowed superhot gases to
escape and ignite the shuttle's external fuel tank.

<TEXT>
   The Chiffons and the Orlons were female
quartets, organized in 1960 to sing pop songs. The Taffetas are
four women organized in 1988 to sing 1950s pop songs at the
off-Broadway Cherry Lane Theater.
   The Taffetas, who pretend to be sisters, remind one most closely
of the Lennon Sisters, of Lawrence Welk reknown. Bubbles even
stream up behind the Taffetas during their encore.
   It's an evening for smiling in the theater. In their
pastel-colored gowns, with matching microphone cords and shoes, the
Taffetas look like they're going to make fun of the '50s. They
don't. They don't comment on the songs or update arrangements.
They're going for nostalgia, in which the audience can look back
with gentle, bemused affection.
   Those who don't remember the '50s can view it like their
parents' antiquated photo album. Those who do can try to recall who
originally sang the songs.
   The Taffetas stress naivete, talking a lot about Mom and their
home town of Muncie, Ind. They sing like crystalized sugar, only
once digging with gusto into a lyric, ``Where the Boys Are.''
   That song was sung originally by Connie Francis. The Taffetas
also draw extensively from Patti Page and Teresa Brewer. ``Mr.
Sandman'' _ that was by the Chordettes. ``Dedicated to the One I
Love'' _ the Shirelles. They don't choose only from female soloists
and quartets. ``Cry'' was a Johnnie Ray hit and the Ames Brothers
first enlightened the world about ``Rag Mop,'' which the Taffetas
take at a stately tempo.
   The singers are Jody Abrahams, Karen Curlee, Melanie Mitchell
and Tia Speros. Pianist Rick Lewis, drummer Mike Osrowitz and
bassist Alan Rubin accompany. The show was conceived by Lewis and
staged and choreographed by Tina Paul.
   Like the mixed quartet in off-Broadway's ``Oil City Symphony,''
the Taffetas take time to talk about their hobbies. They aren't as
clever as the ``Oil City'' four and their music isn't nearly as
varied. Still, an evening with ``The Taffetas'' is a pleasant way,
as they used to say on ``Your Hit Parade,'' to stroll down memory
lane.

   President Virgilio Barco offered
Thursday to initiate peace talks with leftist guerrillas, who
launched their second big attack in a week in northern Colombia.
   Barco introduced his peace plan on national television. He said
the talks should conclude with the dissolution of guerrilla
organizations.
   Guerrillas must stop their terrorist acts, human rights
violations, kidnappings and extortions before talks begin, Barco
said. He said a peace agreement should be reached by the time of
the next presidential and parliamentary elections, in March 1990.
   Guerrillas firing automatic assault rifles, throwing hand
grenades and setting fire to houses killed 12 peasants Tuesday
night, Gov. Jose Gabriel Amin of the state of Cordoba said Thursday.
   The guerrilla attacks appear to be an effort by the rebels to
force the government to open peace talks and make concessions.
   An estimated 30 guerrillas of the People's Liberation Army set
fire to a ranch, killed 10 peasants and wounded 15 Tuesday near the
town of Canalete, Amin said.
   Canalete is about 320 miles north of the capital of Bogota.
   The insurgents then attacked the nearby village of El Tomate,
setting fire to 26 huts and killing two people, the governor said
in a broadcast interview with the Colombian radio chain RCN.
   In El Tomate, a village of 600 people, the attackers left
messages painted on walls declaring, ``Death to the toads and
paramilitaries,'' survivors said in interviews with RCN.
   Guerrillas call army informants toads.
   Peasants in Colombia have long claimed that they are caught
between the army and the guerrillas.
   In dozens of interviews with The Associated Press, peasants have
told of being forced to sell food and other necessities to
guerrillas.
   Often the army hears of this and through threats or torture,
soldiers force the peasants to tell of guerrilla movements, the
peasants say.
   The guerrillas then return and kill the peasants, accusing them
of being army informants, the peasants have said.
   The People's Liberation Army and another guerrilla group known
as the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces attacked the town of
Saisa in the state of Cordoba on Aug. 23 and killed 12 civilians,
10 soldiers and two policemen, the Defense Ministry said earlier.
   Twenty-two soldiers and policemen were taken prisoner, the
ministry said.

   Alvarez was noted not only for physics, but for his work in

and astronomy. During World War II, he was credited with inventing
a number of radar systems and an effective bomb sight.
   Alvarez also played a significant role in developing the atomic
bomb during the Manhattan Project, invented several types of atom
smashers and did a personal analysis of evidence in the 1963
assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
   He was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1968 for his

<HEAD>Computer Glitch Halts Discovery Astronauts' Simulated Flight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A simulated shuttle mission
designed to test the Discovery astronauts' trouble-shooting skills
was halted just before a mock landing because of a real-life
computer crash, NASA officials said.
   The five astronauts were preparing to end their 56-hour mission
Thursday afternoon by simulating a shuttle landing with a flat tire
when the computer shutdown cut the rehearsal short.
   ``I'm sure they'll be looking at it to see why it went down, but
nobody here considers it to be a big problem that the simulation
ended early,'' said NASA Johnson Space Center spokesman James
Hartsfield.
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials stressed
that there was no problem with any kind of computer used in actual
flight control.
   In Huntsville, Ala., meanwhile, engineers at Marshall Space
Flight Center said Thursday's fifth and final test of seals and
joints on the space shuttle booster rocket lifted their confidence
in parts redesigned after the Challenger disaster.
   ``Based on all appearances the test was a complete success,''
said Jim Thomas, technical assistant to the manager of the solid
rocket motor project.
   The two-minute static test firing, with the booster segment
anchored in a $25 million test stand, put launch-style pressure on
the redesigned joints.
   The seals are designed to keep internal hot gases inside the
twin rockets that help kick shuttles into earth orbit. The failure
of a joint in one of Challenger's two boosters was blamed for the
January 1986 explosion that killed all seven crew members.
   Before the computer crash at Johnson Space Center, officials
said, the Discovery crew handled all the simulated problems posed
to them during a dress rehearsal for their flight, which is slated
for late September or early October.
   The 56-hour mock mission began about an hour late Tuesday
morning because of an earlier problem with the shuttle simulator.
   But other glitches faced by the Discovery crew were intentional,
as commander Rick Hauck, pilot Richard Covey and mission
specialists David Hilmers, Mike Lounge and George Nelson were
placed in situations designed to test their ability to solve a
multitude of problems that could encounter on an actual mission.
   Shortly after launch Tuesday, the astronauts were forced to
alter their course and enter a low orbit after NASA trainers staged
a main engine failure.
   On Wednesday, Nelson and Lounge had to go outside the orbiter to
fix a stuck tilt-table needed to deploy a $100 million
communications satellite. That simulation was done in a water tank,
spokeswoman Barbara Selby said.

   Investigators Thursday found the flap
indicator handle on a shattered Boeing 727 in the wrong position,
but a federal safety official said it could have been jarred that
way in the fiery crash, which killed 13 people.
   The handle, which is located on the console between the pilot
and the first officer, indicates the position of the aircraft's
wing flaps.
   At a news conference Thursday night, National Transportation
Safety Board member Lee Dickinson said the handle on the Delta Air
Lines jet that crashed Wednesday was found to be in the ``up
position,'' opposite where it should have been for a proper takeoff.
   But he went on to say the handle could have been pushed into the
wrong position by the impact or by a crew member during the plane's
evacuation.
   Delta Flight 1141 went down as it tried to take off from
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport en route to Salt Lake City
with more than 100 people aboard. Most were able to escape the
burning plane by crawling out of emergency exits or torn-open areas.
   All 13 deaths were attributed to smoke inhalation, according to
the Tarrant County medical examiner's office, with burns also
listed in two instances.
   One of the survivors, Robert Coester, 39, of the Dallas suburb
of Carrollton, said he was most troubled by his unsuccessful
efforts to rescue passengers trapped in the back of the burning
plane.
   ``I tried to get the rear door open,'' said Coester, who was
hospitalized for smoke inhalation and first-, second- and
third-degree burns. ``There was a handle on the outside. I got the
door ajar, but not enough for them to get out.''
   Investigators found at least five bodies near that door after
the flames were extinguished.
   The same flight Thursday from Dallas-Fort Worth to Salt Lake
City was aborted when the pilot detected a problem with his plane.
Most of the 102 passengers, including six survivors of the crash
Wednesday, left about two hours later on another plane, Delta
officials said.
   Federal investigators determined that the flaps and slats aboard
a Northwest Airlines MD-80 had not been properly set for takeoff
when that plane crashed Aug. 16, 1987, at Detroit Metropolitan
airport, killing 156 people.
   Dickinson cautioned that the NTSB investigation team had just
begun to study positions of the Delta aircraft's wings and slats.
   NTSB investigators said none of the witnesses they interviewed
who were on nearby planes could tell them the position of the
airplane's flaps.
   Dickinson said investigators have not talked to the crew, but
hoped to interview First Officer Wilson Kirkland on Friday.
   The NTSB official also said control tower personnel indicated
the Boeing 727 took off at an angle that was higher than normal.
   Control tower workers who watched the plane leaving told
investigators the plane had a ``nose high attitude of 15 to 20
degrees.''
   ``Investigators assume that they meant that was higher than
normal,'' Dickinson said.
   Earlier Thursday, Dickinson told reporters the plane's crew had
another indication of trouble during takeoff. A cockpit tape
recording recovered from the plane showed that pilots had talked
about an engine problem seconds before the jetliner crashed.
   ``Shortly after takeoff there was a sound, (apparently a)
warning a stall condition may be approaching,'' Dickinson said. He
said the sound came from the shaking of the ``stick,'' a device
similar to the steering wheel that automatically makes a sound when
a problem develops.
   ``This indicates the plane may be approaching a point where it
won't be able to fly,'' he said. ``Shortly after that, there was
some conversation about an engine problem.''
   But he stressed that the warning sound could have stemmed from
something besides an engine problem. He would not elaborate, except
to say, ``In this case, we're talking about hydraulics.''
   ``Every accident in its own way is unique,'' said NTSB spokesman
Michael Benson. ``You have to start from the beginning, put
together a mosaic and slowly discover what went wrong.''
   On Wednesday, the 15-year-old Boeing 727 failed to gain
sufficient altitude, bounced three times on the runway and burst
into flames.
   At least 95 people aboard miraculously survived by clambering or
being pulled through emergency doors or through cracks in the
burning fuselage into the hazy sunshine.
   ``Why? Why did it happen? That's the question we have to answer
now,'' Delta spokesman Bill Berry said in Atlanta, Delta's
headquarters.
   Witnesses said there appeared to have been a fire or explosion
in an engine on takeoff, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman
Jack Barker said.
   ``But that was not confirmed,'' he said. ``This was merely what
some witnesses were reporting.''
   Thirty to 40 investigators from the NTSB, Delta, Boeing and
Pratt & Whitney, which manufactured the plane's three engines,
fanned out over an area about the size of two football fields,
examining pieces of the wrecked aircraft.
   Wearing gloves and carrying bags, some crawled inside the
charred hulk, using the same cracks where passengers braved flaming
jet fuel 24 hours earlier. They also climbed on the lone remaining
attached wing, which had been turned red-hot by the fire, to peer
into the cabin through blackened windows. At one point, about 20 of
them gathered, peering intently at the left rear engine. They
removed the engine shroud and looked inside.
   The cockpit recording, as well as the plane's flight data
recorder, had already been recovered in good condition from the
wreckage and taken to Washington for analysis.
   Dickinson said safety board officials had listened to the
cockpit tape recording just once, and they and other investigators
planned to listen to again.
   The pilot, Capt. Larry Davis, 48, of Greenville, was pinned in
the wreckage and had to be extricated by rescuers. He was listed in
fair condition Thursday at Parkland Hospital in Dallas, suffering
back injuries and burns.
   Davis has been a Delta pilot since 1965 and a Boeing 727 captain
for nine years.
   His co-pilot and engineer also survived the accident, but two
Delta flight attendants were among the 13 fatalities. All of the
dead were from Texas.
   Ninety-seven passengers and a crew of seven were listed aboard
the aircraft, but the exact count was uncertain because babies were
not included on passenger lists.
   Three years ago, a Delta L-1011 crashed at the same airport,
killing 137 in the worst aviation accident in Texas history.
   Delta spokesman Henry Conley said none of the airline's other
727s would be pulled from service because of Wednesday's crash.
``We don't see anything serious enough to pull any planes,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Pinochet Lifts Ban on Exiles; Opponents Dismiss Move As

   Right-wing President Augusto Pinochet
announced that hundreds of his critics living in exile may return
to Chile, but opponents said the move, and others like it, are
aimed only at winning votes in a presidential referendum.
   Four hours after Thursday's announcement, Isabel Allende, 44,
the daughter of former President Salvador Allende, flew to
Santiago. She has been living in Mexico since her father, a
self-proclaimed Marxist, died during a bloody coup led by Pinochet
15 years ago.
   Asked why she returned, she told reporters at the airport,
``Because it's my legitimate right.''
   She said her mother, Hortensia Bussi, the exiled widow of
Allende, also plans to return. ``We are going to prepare a grand
entrance, through the front door, as we've always said,'' Ms.
Allende said.
   Jose Oyarce, a Communist who was labor minister in the Allende
government, returned to his homeland on the same flight as Ms.
Allende.
   Pinochet lifted a ban on the return of 430 Chileans who had
opposed him, including some of the fiercest leftist opponents of
his military government.
   ``The prohibitions are lifted. All of them,'' the president told
reporters. ``I have spoken this morning with the interior minister
and have given instructions with respect to exile that totally
solves this problem.''
   Opponents said the army general is only trying to lure voters in
an Oct. 5 presidential referendum in which Pinochet is the sole
candidate.
   His nomination for the referendum was made Tuesday by Pinochet
himself and the commanders of the navy, air force and national
police. It sparked nationwide anti-government protests.
   If the majority of Chileans vote ``no'' in the ballot, an open
election is to be held. If they vote ``yes,'' Pinochet would begin
an eight-year term as president in March.
   ``The regime is trying to change (Pinochet's) image on the eve
of the referendum,'' said Patricio Aylwin, leader of a 16-party
opposition coalition.
   Aylwin challenged Pinochet to a ``free and open'' debate on
national television, ``so he can have the opportunity to contrast
his ideas with those of the opposition.''
   In another move opponents say was aimed at winning the
referendum, Pinochet last week lifted the state of emergency that
has suppressed civil liberties since the 1973 coup.
   The president also ordered a 3 percent reduction in the price of
gasoline.
   On Wednesday, Pinochet made a conciliatory gesture toward his
critics, appealing for their support in a nationally televised
speech.
   ``There is a new democracy ahead of us. We must work together to
make it efficient,'' the 72-year-old general said. ``Our democracy
has a place for everybody.''
   The tone of the speech contrasted sharply with Pinochet's past
references to opposition leaders, whom he has called ``traitors''
and ``bandits'' who ``sell out their motherland.''
   Pinochet told reporters at the government palace Thursday that
he is not shifting his style in an effort to change his
authoritarian image.
   ``What happens is that a person must act according to the
circumstances,'' he said.
   Supporters praised Pinochet's moves as proof of his intention to
hold an honest referendum.
   ``The decision of ending exile is part of the President's appeal
to peace and unity of all Chileans,'' said Interior Minister Sergio
Fernandez.
   Carlos Cabello, leader of an independent organization supporting
Pinochet, said ``the move shows the President's deep democratic
conviction.''
   But Jose Sanfuentes, a spokesman for the outlawed Communist
Party, said: ``Pinochet will take other measures to try to buy out
the consciences of Chileans, but these measures will not prevent
the collapse of his dictatorship.''

   The unprecedented chaos in Congress while
President Miguel de la Madrid delivered his last address to the
nation drew a blizzard of criticism and praise, with some calling
it offensive and others saying it was just democracy in action.
   Opposition delegates interrupted de la Madrid continuously
Thursday in a series of displays never before seen in Congress,
which has been absolutely controlled by the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, for 59 years.
   The outbursts included chants of ``Fraud!'' and ``Mexico!''
Opposition delegates waved what they said were burned, invalidated
ballots and staged a walkout that almost degenerated into a brawl.
   De la Madrid maintained his composure throughout the 3{-hour
speech as he sought to sum up a six-year term that began in near
bankruptcy and is ending with economic reform and political
controversy.
   ``Let us be tolerant, even in the face of the insults of our
political adversaries,'' he said, departing from his prepared text
after the walkout.
   The noisy demonstrations ``showed the delegates' courage'' in
demanding explanations, said Democratic Front presidential
candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who claims fraud cheated him of
victory in the July 6 elections.
   The general secretary of the PRI, Manuel Camacho Solis, praised
de la Madrid's coolness and condemned the protesters for
``immaturity'' and ``anti-democratic practices.''
   Fidel Velazquez, the crusty 87-year-old labor leader who heads
one of the strongest sections of the governing party, said he'd
never seen anything like it. ``But then, we never had such silly
opposition before,'' he added.
   Later, a Democratic Front delegate, Salvador Miranda Polanco,
announced he was changing his loyalty to the PRI in part because he
``does not agree with fascist ideologies.''
   A presidential spokesman, who in accord with standard practice
could not be named, was more sanguine. The protests, he said, were
``normal in any parliamentary system.''
   The speech was interrupted regularly from the beginning, but the
climax came when leftist Democratic Front delegates led by Sen.
Porfirio Munoz Ledo walked out amid shouts of ``Traitor,'' ``Get
out, Judas,'' and assorted obscenities.
   Munoz Ledo, who was once president of the PRI, was kicked in the
rear and hit in the neck by two PRI state governors. A governing
party legislator grabbed Munoz Ledo and asked, ``What is happening
to you? This is not the time, brother.''
   The galleries, filled with PRI supporters, wives and military
brass, roared disapproval and governing party delegates chanted
``Mexico!'' to drown out the opposition.
   ``We are walking out in protest because they refused to let the
voice of the opposition be heard,'' Munoz Ledo declared. De la
Madrid's speech, he said, was full of ``falsehoods and
inaccuracies.''
   Members of the rightist National Action Party demonstrated but
did not walk out. Party leader Abel Vincenio Tovar said he
``respected the gesture'' but preferred less ``hysterical'' means.
   He criticized the PRI for packing the house. His party, with 101
delegates, was allowed to invite a total of four spectators, he
said.
   ``When the ruling party doesn't have the backing of the people,
they have to bring their own supporters,'' he said.
   The same fractious Congress must, in the next two months,
certify the election of de la Madrid's successor, Carlos Salinas de
Gortari, who did not attend. Salinas is scheduled to take over Dec.
1.
   The most strident objections came when de la Madrid spoke of the
controversial July 6 vote, which he praised as ``historic,'' but
there were also interruptions as he spoke of his economic reforms.
   The reforms reduced state control of the economy, kept the
nation out of bankruptcy and controlled inflation, but also reduced
the average Mexican's buying power by about 50 percent.
   De la Madrid's own election reforms broke the governing party's
stranglehold and allowed opposition strength to grow. Before
Miranda's announced switch, the PRI held 260 seats in the Chamber
of Deputies to 139 for the Democratic Front and National Action's
101.
   The Democratic Front also holds four of 64 Senate seats.
National Action holds none.
   State-controlled Mexican television showed some of the protests
during a live broadcast of the speech.
   Although the cameras shied away during the walkout, shouts and
curses were audible. Mexicans later watched the entire incident on
news shows.

   Fire-plagued Yellowstone National Park reopened its south gate
Thursday for the first time in almost two weeks, but was forced to
close the west entrance late in the day when a 109,100-acre blaze
flared up.
   Elsewhere in the West, officials took measures to keep hunters,
fishers and campers out of the woods over Labor Day weekend.
   In eastern Oregon, officials banned recreational users from 3.8
million acres of state-protected forest and range land, effective
Friday _ the first day of the long holiday weekend. Already closed
are 2.8 million acres of land in western Oregon.
   ``The state needs to limit the risk of wildfire, and this has
proven to be an effective way to do that,'' State Forester James E.
Brown said.
   Last year, 10.3 million acres in western Oregon were closed to
the public for 11 days because of extreme fire danger. In that
period, fires blamed on human activities dropped from six to one a
day, said Kathy Apling, a state forestry spokeswoman.
   Strict fire restrictions have also been imposed throughout
Washington state, said Kathy Albert, a Forest Service spokesperson.
   ``Our message to everyone is no campfires unless in developed
campsites, with the exception of using a pressurized-liquid gas
camping stove,'' she said.
   Fires also burned Thursday in Montana, Utah, Washington, Idaho
and California.
   In Montana, the hunting season was scheduled to begin Thursday,
but a reluctant state Fish and Game Commission agreed _ at the
request of Gov. Ted Schwinden _ to postpone the start of all
hunting seasons until Sept. 16 because of the fire danger.
   The delay affected as many as 75,000 hunters, state officials
said.
   Schwinden had succinct advice for people who were thinking about
going to the woods over the weekend: ``Find some asphalt.''
   Ten major fires burned in the state Thursday.
   One of two huge fires north of Yellowstone tore through a fire
line late Wednesday and continued burning toward a dude ranch, fire
officials in Montana said.
   ``We've got major fires on both sides of the Silvertip Ranch,''
fire information officer Chris Comstock said Thursday. The Storm
Creek and the Hellroaring Creek fires in the Absaroka-Beartooth
Wilderness have charred more than 90,000 acres and were only three
miles apart.
   ``Down-canyon'' wind blew the flames of the Storm Creek blaze
through a 5.5-mile fire line that crews had spent four days
building in rugged country, fire information officer Nick Tafoya
said.
   Near West Yellowstone, Mont., crews used bulldozers to carve a
12-foot wide fire line between the gateway town and the western
flank of the North Fork fire inside the nation's oldest national
park. The gray sky seemed to be raining ash Thursday afternoon,
with visibility was down to a half mile and a light breeze keeping
the snow-like ash in the air.
   By nighttime, ``slop-over'' from the fire line reached within 1{
miles of West Yellowstone.
   ``There's a lot of flame and a lot of smoke out there. The fire
is extremely visible from town,'' said Kathy Good, a U.S. Forest
Service spokesman in West Yellowstone.
   All five gates to the park and all roads within it were open for
a tim Thursday, until the worsening conditions caused the closure
of the west entrance. Park spokesman Bill Stalker said the west
entrance was expected to reopen within a few hours once the spot
fires were taken care of.
   The park's chief naturalist, George Robinson, said officials
anticipated that the fires ``will keep burning until the first
heavy winter snows.''
   In Oregon, the Tepee Butte fire, the state's largest wildfire
this year, has burned 40,316 acres of grass and timber in the
Wallowa-Whitman National Forest and the Hell's Canyon National
Recreation Area, said Ron DeHart, spokesman for the multiagency
fire coordination center in Portland. The fire will grow to 59,000
acres before it reaches fire lines, DeHart added.
   Firefighters struggled to contain five major fires in the
mountain ranges of Northern California.
   A 6-year-old boy playing with matches started a fire Wednesday
that destroyed two homes and charred 560 acres south of Mariposa, a
town 150 miles east of San Francisco, said Kary Weaver, a state
department of forestry spokeswoman. About 100 people were evacuated
from the neighborhood, she said.
   One of three major fires in northeastern Washington state roared
through containment lines, but authorities reported progress in
containing the other two blazes. Wildfires have charred more than
24,500 acres in the state.
   In Idaho, more than 3,000 firefighters remained on the lines of
the worst of the 17 major fires burning over 70,000 acres.
   Overnight winds whipped a once-controlled fire near northern
Utah's Pineview Reserevoir into a fast-moving inferno that jumped
fire lines and more than doubled to 1,200 acres by Thursday, fire

   Amnesty International says it hopes to raise the
conscience of youth when Bruce Springsteen, Peter Gabriel, and
other rock stars launch a worldwide concert tour dedicated to human
rights.
   The six-week tour, which opens tonight at London's Wembley
Stadium, will go to 20 cities in North America, Asia, Hungary,
Africa, and Latin America.
   The $23 million extravaganza is to mark the 40th anniversary of
the United Nations Universal Declaration on Human Rights.
Organizers expect sell-out crowds but stress that raising money is
not the sole intention.
   ``This tour is not about charity, it's about justice,'' said
Jack Healey, head of the U.S. division of the organization, which
monitors human rights abuses and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977.
   ``What we're talking about is human rights and the seriousness
of the issue ... there's too much torture, too many people being
killed,'' he said.
   The pop stars taking part are both realistic and romantic about
playing for human rights.
   ``When I was younger I thought maybe you could pick a guitar up
and you could change the world,'' Springsteen, 38, said at a news
conference Thursday.
   ``I don't really believe that any more. But I do believe you can
save a life,'' he added. ``Someone comes to the show, they hear the
message, they hear what we are singing about, they go home, they
write a letter and someone gets out of prison early. That's pretty
good.''
   Springsteen is sharing a bill on the 35,000-mile tour with
Gabriel and Sting, American folk singer Tracey Chapman and Sengal's
Youssou N'Dour.
   More than 1 million people are expected to see the concerts
live, with televison audiences of many more.
   Ticket prices vary from rich to poorer countries _ $37.60 in
London and $3 in Budapest, Hungary. The final concert is scheduled
in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, on Oct. 15.
   The U.S. sports goods manufacturer Reebok has underwritten the
cost of the tour, and organizers say they hope it will break even.
   ``This is definitely not for fund-raising,'' said Healey, who
put together a two-week American tour called ``Conspiracy of Hope''
in 1986 featuring Gabriel, Sting and an Irish group, U2.
   It convinced him that rock music works for human rights.
Amnesty's U.S. membership rose by 100,000 to 250,000 in the year
following the tour.
   The organization has a worldwide membership of 750,000.
   Every audience member will get a card with the text of the U.N.
declaration on human rights. Spectators will also be able to sign
slips of paper saying they uphold the declaration. At the end of
tour, Amnesty plans to deliver these to the governments of the
nations visited.
   Amnesty's venture is the latest using rock music to raise
consciences.
   Irish rock singer Bob Geldof's Live Aid concert in 1985 raised
millions of dollars for the starving Ethiopians, and this year
thousands turned out to mark South African black leader Nelson
Mandela's 70th birthday with a London concert.
   ``The reason we have an appeal for the young is, I believe, the
fact that they are still able to say when they hear of an
individual's plight, `But that's not fair,''' said Marie Staunton,
director of Amnesty's British section.
   Gabriel, a longtime campaigner for Amnesty, said he agreed with
critics that a song won't change the behavior of a dictator.
   ``But we hope it can affect the way his children and his
grandchildren think. ... These are our target,'' said Gabriel.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Pinochet's Anti-Marxism Not Enough To Please
U.S.</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States normally casts a benign eye
on countries that welcome foreign investment, engage in free trade,
repay their debts, respect their neighbors and oppose communism.
   There aren't many countries with all these perceived virtues,
but one that does _ Chile _ has had a virutally unbroken record of
poor relations with the United States for 15 years.
   This seemingly anomalous situation has occurred because of
Chile's military president, Augusto Pinochet, whose human rights
abuses and distrust for democracy have more than offset aspects of
his rule which generally get an approving nod from Washington.
   Lately, the Reagan administration has adopted a friendlier view
toward Pinochet now that many civil liberties have been restored as
the country gears up for a presidential plebiscite next month in
which the 72-year-old general will be the lone candidate.
   Top military commanders announced their selection of Pinochet on
Tuesday, touching off a wave of protests that led to the deaths of
at least three people and the arrests of more than 1,000 others.
   While the United States has kept its distance, diplomatically,
from the general for years, Pinochet himself has been scornful of
Washington, telling American visitors that U.S. leaders should be
more appreciative of a government that deposed a Marxist-led
regime, an event virtually without precedent.
   Indeed, some American officials, citing Pinochet's economic and
foreign policies, believe long years of Reagan administration
hostility toward Chile was misguided.
   As an example, with the exception of Honduras, Chile sided with
the United States on more U.N. votes than any other Latin American
country during the last General Assembly session. Among all Third
World nations, only Turkey and Honduras were more supportive of
Washington's positions.
   Beyond that, while other hemispheric countries are mired in
economic crisis, Chile boasted a healthy 5.4 percent growth rate
last year, using market-oriented policies the U.S. advocates.
   And unlike many other hemispheric countries, Chile pays its
debts, allows foreign investors to remit profits and has been
selling off state-run enterprises.
   Also winning sympathy for Pinochet among some officials is the
presence of well-armed guerrilla groups which have staged repeated
terrorist attacks over the years.
   But at a time when the United States has been emphasizing
democractic development in the hemisphere, the administration felt
it could not make an exception by showing friendship toward
Pinochet.
   The administration's attempts to promote democracy in Nicaragua
would lose credibility if Chile were exempted from this policy,
officials contended, overriding those who favored greater
recognition of the positive side of Pinochet's rule.
   Beyond that, the Democratic majority in Congress, many of whom
have bitter memories of the early years of the Pinochet regime,
strongly oppose any accommodation with Chile.
   Whatever gratitude Pinochet generated in Washington for ousting
President Salvador Allende in 1973 was short-lived because of way
he dealt with those who opposed him.
   As outlined by Aryeh Neier, director of Americas Watch, a New
York-based human rights group, there were a ``huge number'' of
killings in Chile during those early years. ``Nobody knows the
actual count,'' he says.
   Some political activists disappeared without a trace and there
were widespread allegations that political detainees were tortured.
   American alienation from Chile was aggravated when U.S.
investigators blamed Chilean security agents for the 1976
car-bombing death in Washington of a former top Allende aide,
Orlando Letelier. This was one of the most notorious incidents of
international terrorism ever to occur on U.S. soil.
   A decade ago, Chile was a major target of the fresh emphasis on
human rights introduced by President Carter. Nowadays, the U.S.
focus is on democracy in the hemisphere and, at long last, the
prospect of the first genuine electoral test in Chile since 1973
has induced hopes in Washington that representative democracy may
return to Chile.
   Still, the long record of U.S. hostility toward Pinochet
contrasts sharply with the friendship the United States
demonstrated for years toward another Third World military
strongman, President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq of Pakistan, who was
killed in a plane crash two weeks ago.
   The records of both Zia and Pinochet on human rights are
similar. For Washington, the difference is that Zia ruled a
strategically important country and Pinochet doesn't.

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis Have Mixed Records on Environment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At the close of a summer when Americans baked
under extreme heat and watched beaches fouled by medical wastes,
George Bush and Michael Dukakis are both fighting hard to convince
voters they are friends of the environment.
   Republican nominee Bush, who boasts ``I am an environmentalist,
always have been,'' finds himself battling both Dukakis and a
Reagan administration record that environmental groups contend was
often inimical to the causes of clean air, land and water.
   Bush took that battle to Boston Harbor on Thursday, where he
accused the Democratic nominee of dragging his heels while the
pollution-clogged harbor got ``dirtier and dirtier.''
   Dukakis ridiculed Bush's ``election-year conversion,'' saying
Boston harbor has ``been polluted for hundreds of years, and I'm
very proud to be the governor who's cleaning it up ... no thanks to
Vice President Bush and the administration he is part of.''
   ``Boston Harbor is not Michael Dukakis' shining moment,'' said
Jeff Webb, a Friends of the Earth lobbyist. ``But that's one issue
in one state. What about eight years of neglect?''
   In a March assessment, the League of Conservation Voters league
gave Dukakis a grade of B and Bush a D-plus.
   Arlene O'Donnell of the Massachusetts Audubon Society said
Dukakis has exhibited a growing sensitivity to environmental
issues, although ``he still tends, on bulldozer-versus-trees kind
of things, to take the business side.''
   Bush said Wednesday that ``1988, in a sense, is the year the
Earth spoke back.'' He called for an international conference next
year to discuss global warming and ozone depletion, which may be
behind the unusually hot summer.
   Republicans say one of their own, Teddy Roosevelt, was one of
the first environmentalists, and Bush hopes to reclaim the
environmental mantle for the GOP.
   But to do that, he must overcome distrust left by President
Reagan's problems with the Superfund to clean up toxic waste, the
president's go-slow attitude toward new measures to curb acid rain
_ measures Bush endorsed in a speech Wednesday _ and Reagan's 1987
veto of a $20 billion authorization to clean up U.S. waterways.
   Environmentalists also criticize Bush for heading a deregulation
task force that paved the way for a Reagan executive order giving
the White House Office of Management and Budget veto power over
environmental and other regulations. Dukakis has promised to revoke
that executive order.
   In reply to a questionnaire from the League of Conservation
Voters, Bush said: ``In the past few years, we have not done enough
to protect the environment. I will do more.''
   Bush has backed a goal of ``no net loss of wetlands.''
   Dukakis has called for protecting existing wetlands and
restoring ``part of the vast endowment of wetlands that America has
lost.'' But his administration approved filling a swamp for a
shopping center near Attleboro, a development the Reagan
Environmental Protection Agency went to court to block.
   Dukakis has won high marks among some environmentalists for his
dogged battle to block licensing of the stillborn Seabrook nuclear
plant in New Hampshire, as well as court fights to block oil
drilling in the Georges Bank off the New England coast.
   Bush, himself a pioneer of the offshore drilling industry, last
spring endorsed a moratorium on drilling in sensitive offshore
areas such as California. He also has promised to seek an end to
dumping of wastes in the ocean by 1991.
   Dukakis said Bush recently supported offshore drilling in a
Texas appearance, prompting the Democrat to declare that the nation
needed ``a president whose environmental policy doesn't change with
the time zones.''
   On nuclear power, Dukakis opposes construction of new commercial
reactors until a new, safer design is developed and ways are found
to treat and dispose of nuclear waste.
   Bush says, ``I believe nuclear power must be a part of our
energy mix,'' and says he will ``insist on the highest safety
standards.''
   On acid rain, Bush promised Wednesday to ask Congress to cut
millions of tons of sulfur dioxide emissions by the year 2,000 and
to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions.
   Dukakis has said he will use authority under existing law to
force industrial states ``that are major contributors to the acid
rain problem to find solutions within three years.''
   Both favor ``clean coal'' research to tap the nation's abundant
supply of fossil fuel.

   Investigators examining the Pratt & Whitney
JT8D engine as a possible cause of Wednesday's Delta Air Lines
crash are scrutinizing a powerplant with which the aircraft
industry has conducted a quarter-century love affair.
   Almost 12,000 of the engines have been sold since the Federal
Aviation Administration approved them in 1964. Today, they are used
by 350 airlines, governments and corporations and are more widely
utilized than all other commercial jet engines combined, Pratt &
Whitney spokesman David Long said Thursday.
   ``It's one of the more reliable engines on the market today,''
said James P. McFadden, aerospace analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets in New York.
   Even before Delta Flight 1141 plunged to the ground Wednesday
shortly after takeoff from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport,
the government had named the JT8D as contributing to two major
accidents that occurred in 1985.
   On Thursday, National Transportation Safety Board member Lee
Dickinson said recordings of cockpit conversations on Flight 1141
before the accident revealed discussions of engine problems and
noises indicating a stall may have been imminent.
   Witnesses reported seeing flames streaming from an engine just
before the crash. Thirteen people were killed, but nearly 100
survived the fiery wreck.
   Despite those blemishes, the engine is so reliable the
government uses the frequency rate with which they break down in
flight as the benchmark against which new engines are measured.
   So far this year, the JT8Ds have shut down in flight 0.012 times
per 1,000 hours of flight, Long said from Pratt & Whitney offices
in East Hartford, Conn.
   According to Jay Pardee, manager of the FAA's engine
certification office in Burlington, Mass., some engines have been
known to shut down one or two times per 1,000 hours of flight.
   ``It's a goal we require all new technologies to meet,'' Pardee
said of the JT8D's performance statistics.
   All Boeing 727s _ Flight 1141 was a 727 _ use three of the
engines mounted on the rear of the aircraft. They are also used on
many Boeing 737s and McDonnell Douglas DC-9s. In addition,
McDonnell Douglas MD-80s use JT8D-200s, an advanced model of the
engine.
   Pratt & Whitney estimates that in all, the engines have flown
more than 400 million hours in nearly a quarter-century of service.
   ``For an engine to be around for 25 years says a lot about its
acceptance,'' said McFadden of Merrill Lynch.
   But problems with the JT8D have been blamed by government
officials as contributing to two major air accidents in 1985.
   In Manchester, England, in August of that year, the engine's
combustion chamber cracked and burned through on a British AirTours
jetliner during takeoff. Fifty-five people died when the plane
caught fire.
   The accident sparked widespread inspections of combustion
chambers of older, high-use JT8D engines as well as a requirement
for more frequent inspections to check for cracks.
   The next month, a Midwest Express DC-9 crashed in Milwaukee,
killing 31 people, in an accident that was blamed on a fracture of
the engine spacers, which separate the turbine blades. Afterward,
the FAA ordered owners of planes with the engines to conduct
inspections looking for cracks, and to replace the spacers
periodically.

   The FBI expects to lose up to half its
professional staff to retirement over the next decade and will need
an aggressive recruitment campaign to find new agents, the bureau's
director says.
   William Sessions said at a luncheon meeting Thursday that the
recruitment demands make it even more challenging to find women and
minorities for the FBI.
   ``It is clear that we must develop effective measures to respond
to our extraordinary hiring needs,'' Sessions said. ``Somehow it
feels like bobbing for apples at Halloween with your hands behind
your back.''
   Not only has the pool of college graduates begun a projected
10-year decline, the FBI does not have the salaries and employee
benefits to compete with private industry, Sessions said.
   ``We have esprit; we have an important and urgent mission; we
have the strong call of meaningful public service. But we must
still battle to gain the agents with the skills and education
necessary to fulfill our mission.''
   Within nine years, Sessions said, more than half the FBI's
professionals _ about 4,500 people _ will either be forced or
eligible to retire.
   Sessions said that as part of the recruitment effort he has
approved a five-year minority hiring program designed to increase
the number of blacks and Hispanics in the FBI.
   Out of 9,597 agents, 417 are black and 439 are Hispanic. In the
U.S. population, blacks account for about 12 percent and Hispanics
make up about 8 percent.
   Sessions, a former federal judge, said that since he became FBI
director 10 months ago he has moved to eliminate racism and
discrimination.
   ``From the beginning, I have tried to make the FBI's policy
against racism and discrimination crystal clear to every member of
the FBI, both by policy statements ... and by personally addressing
employees,'' he said.
   But he refused to talk about pending legal actions taken by a
group of Hispanic agents and by a black agent.
   More than 300 of the bureau's Hispanic agents have filed a
class-action suit in El Paso, Texas, contending the FBI
discriminates against them in promotions, discipline and
assignments. A federal judge is expected to issue a decision in the
case by Oct. 1. The Hispanics seek unspecified damages and changes
in FBI policies.
   In the other case, Donald Rochon, a black agent in the
Philadelphia office, has filed racial harassment charges against
the government. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has
already upheld many of Rochon's complaints, stemming from his
tenure in the Omaha, Neb., office.
   Sessions acknowledged that the FBI must make improvements so its
agent workforce will ``more nearly reflect our nation's ethnic
composition.''
   He said the FBI is seeking to hire women and minorities in
specialties needed increasingly by the bureau: linguists,
engineers, computer scientists, lawyers and accountants.

<HEAD>Food Price Hike Fears Exaggerated, Economist Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumers who are braced for higher food
prices because of the summer's drought should breathe a little
easier, says an Agriculture Department economist.
   Fears that the total at the checkout counter is going to shoot
upward because of farmers' problems are largely based on erroneous
assumptions about the way food prices are set and on exaggerations
of the drought's effects on food supplies, says Ralph Parlett of
the department's Economic Research Service.
   ``Although grain and soybean stocks are not as large as they
were in some prior drought years, we are in no foreseeable danger
of running out of food,'' Parlett says in an article in the
department's Farmline magazine.
   ``Supplies of grains are more than ample to meet demand,''
Parlett said. Winter wheat, used for baking bread, was harvested
before the drought struck. Meat and poultry production is expected
to hit record levels, and most fruit and vegetable crops will be
undamaged because they are grown under irrigation, he said.
   The bottom line: overall food prices, which had previously been
forecast to rise 2 to 4 percent this year, now are expected to go
up 3 to 5 percent _ a one-point boost because of the dry weather.
   There is concern, however, that some middlemen in the food chain
might seek to exploit the dry conditions as an excuse for higher
prices. At least two members of Congress _ Rep. Byron Dorgan,
D-N.D., and Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate
Agriculture Committee _ have asked the General Accounting Office to
monitor food prices for evidence of gouging.
   ``We know that in previous times, gouging has occurred,'' Dorgan
said. The GAO, Congress' investigative arm, will track food prices
at the farm, the wholesale and retail levels for a marketbasket
that includes white bread, choice beef, chicken, bacon, milk,
fruit, vegetables, ground beef, chuck roast, spaghetti and macaroni.
   ``People vote with their food dollars,'' said Dorgan. ``If we
find price gouging, the ability to spotlight that ... will persuade
consumers to move their dollars toward other brands or other
commodities.''
   Parlett said most affected by price increases will be pasta
products, which are made from drought-damaged durum wheat,
vegetable oils, oat-based cereals and a few fruits and vegetables
such as sweet corn, peas, dry beans and tart cherries.
   Fresh fruit and vegetable supplies and quality have been
affected in some non-irrigated drought areas where food stores look
to local farmers to fill their produce departments during the
growing season. But most produce effects were felt in areas where
vegetables are grown for canning, Parlett said.
   Fears that drought translates into sharply higher food prices
are founded on some false assumptions, the economist said.
   If shortages do result in higher commodity prices for farmers,
the effect is greatly diluted by the time the product reaches the
consumer because the farm value of foods accounts for an average of
only 30 percent of their retail price. Most of the cost of an item
is in its processing, packaging and marketing.
   In addition, said Parlett, food middlemen tend to absorb at
least some of the short-term fluctuations in farm prices. And since
food production is geographically diversified, even widespread
droughts affect only certain production sectors. With commodities
such as grains, which are in surplus, reserves are available to
make up for drought-attenuated crops.
   Dry weather has a reverse effect on meat supplies, usually
forcing increases in slaughter and a supply glut which tends to
hold down consumer prices in the short run. The reduced cattle and
hog numbers could have a delayed upward influence on prices,
however, probably leading to price increases next year, said
Parlett.
   Historically, food prices tend to rise every year regardless of
farm prices, he said. In the 1980 drought year food prices rose 8.6
percent, but that was down from 10.9 percent in 1979 when crops
were good, he pointed out. Another drought in 1983 was accompanied
by a 2.1 percent food cost rise, the lowest since 1967.

   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
100,000 metric tons for delivery this year under a long-term supply
agreement between the two countries, the Agriculture Department
says.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 100,000 tons of
corn would be about 3.9 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.49 per bushel at the
farm level, meaning that the sale could have a farm value of around
$9.8 million.
   The corn is part of the grain the Soviet Union is committed to
buy during the fifth and final year of the agreement, which calls
for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of U.S. grain.
The pact expires Sept. 30, and there have been negotiations for a
new one.
   According to the agreement, the annual purchases are supposed to
include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The
Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as
wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two
tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.
   If the latest purchase is shipped before the current agreement
expires, the Soviets will have bought 5.27 million tons of corn, in
addition to more than 9 million tons of wheat; 830,700 tons of
soybeans, and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal.

<HEAD>Report Lambasts OSHA's Enforcement of Job-Safety Laws</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Occupational Safety and Health
Administration has failed to enforce laws protecting the nation's
workers, a failure contributing to thousands of workplace deaths, a
critic of the federal agency says.
   A report being released today by the Chicago-based National Safe
Workplace Institute concluded that OSHA's ineffectiveness and
unwillingness to be tough with violators has resulted in more than
9,000 avoidable workplace fatalities since 1981.
   However, statisticians and the federal agency disputed the
figure and said on-the-job deaths have declined sharply during the
1980s.
   ``This report represents a selective use of statistics,'' OSHA's
chief spokesman, Terry Mikelson, said. ``It creates the impression
that more and more people are being killed at work, that more and
more people are being hurt, when just the opposite is true.''
   The institute, which is supported by foundation grants and
private contributions, said the United States has become ``a
first-rate nation with a second-rate record of protecting (its)
workers.''
   ``We have to agree with some of what they say,'' said Margaret
Seminario, associate director of safety and health for the AFL-CIO.
``We really do have some serious problems with OSHA.''
   The report, a copy of which was obtained Thursday, accused the
agency of inconsistency and criticized ``sweetheart deals'' that
reduced fines against large corporate violators.
   For example, it said OSHA proposed fines of $1.48 million
against Union Carbide Corp. in 1986 but accepted a settlement of
$408,500.
   But Mikelson, the OSHA spokesman, said, ``Historically, the
agency has reduced penalties in the interest of obtaining immediate
abatement of hazards. That is our mission: to correct hazards, to
get them out of the workplace, and we've done that.''
   The report said OSHA does not have a comprehensive program to
target employers for inspections.
   It said OSHA inspectors were three times more likely to issue
their most serious sanction, a willful citation, in fiscal 1980 _
before President Reagan took office _ than in fiscal 1981 through
1987.
   ``OSHA's senior staff has failed to provide leadership to make
its civil enforcement programs effective,'' the institute said.
``That failure has cost lives. If we had continued improving job
safety at the same rate which was in place in 1980, 9,115 workplace
fatality victims would still be alive today.''
   The conclusion was based on a statistical analysis reflecting a
change in the rate of deaths among workers in high-risk jobs:
agriculture, construction, transportation and manufacturing. It
said the rate of high-risk deaths declined by an annual rate of 2.2
percent from 1975 through 1980 and by 0.7 percent from 1981 through
1987.
   The Chicago-based National Safety Council, whose data was used
in the analysis, said the death toll from on-the-job accidents has
fallen from 13,000 in 1975 to 11,100 last year.
   ``It may be they're hoping people won't look into how they
arrived at their conclusions and just take them at face value,''
said Alan Hoskin, the council's director of statistics.
   He said the six-year period used to determine the death trend
was too short and the assumption of a constant decline in
fatalities ``very rarely exists in the real world.''
   ``We very carefully researched the methodology with the American
Statistical Association,'' said Joseph A. Kinney, executive
director of the institute. ``They checked everything out and think
our approach was very fair.''
   The ASA's executive director, Barbara Bailar, disagreed.
   ``I don't think anybody really looked at it very carefully,''
she said. ``I think that's an extremely dangerous thing to do.
Projections are noted for having a lot of problems with them.''

<HEAD>FCC Sets Development Rules for Enhanced TV Technology</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The broadcast and electronics industries are
praising the Federal Communications Commission's endorsement of
advanced television systems with enhanced sound and picture quality.
   The FCC on Thursday declared the new systems in the public
interest and approved some preliminary rules for bringing them into
American homes. But the commission said many technical and
procedural problems still must be ironed out.
   The ``high definition'' TV systems will be designed to have the
clarity of movie film and the sound of compact discs. They probably
will not be available from the U.S. broadcast industry before 1993,
according to an official of the National Association of
Broadcasters.
   Michael Rau, the NAB's vice president for science and
technology, said the FCC made a ``strong commitment to bring
advanced TV to the public. They seemed to reaffirm support for
free, over-the-air broadcasting.
   ``But the commission must solve the difficulties of delivering
the system over broadcast outlets.''
   In a series of preliminary rulings, the FCC said:
   _Existing broadcasters and stations are best equipped to bring
the new system to viewers.
   _Advanced television programs must be received on existing
television sets so viewers won't have to replace their equipment.
   _If additional frequency space is needed, it should be found
within existing VHF and UHF television bands. The FCC found that
looking for frequencies outside those bands would delay the
service, and noted that bands now suitable for the systems are in
use for other purposes.
   Mark Rosenker, spokesman for the Electronics Industry
Association, said his group of electronics manufacturers is
``pleased that the FCC's decision ... has begun to define the
complex issues regarding high definition television so that the
American public will be able to enjoy the benefits ... within a
relatively short period.''
   The FCC sought public comment on three options for using the
airwaves for high definition TV. There would be a 60-day comment
period and 30 days for replies.
   FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick and Commissioner Patricia Diaz
Dennis supported all the commission's findings and proposed
options. Commissioner James H. Quello dissented on grounds the
commission acted prematurely.
   Quello said the FCC based its preliminary findings on computer
projections and should have waited until the technology was tested
and developed.
   But Patrick said the technology to improve picture resolution
exists today, and the FCC should spur further research and
development.
   His view was supported by Ms. Dennis, who said: ``Some urge us
to move more slowly, to wait for more evidence before acting. That
is tempting ... but delay creates significant costs.''
   Although Patrick said the preliminary rulings would ``put the
U.S. in the forefront of the international quest for new TV
technology,'' the Japanese have been working on an advanced system
for two decades.
   They plan to offer a preview with broadcasts of the summer
Olympics to high definition TV sets in about 50 big-city department
stores throughout Japan.
   The picture on a standard television set in the United States is
produced by a signal that scans more than 200,000 dots on 525
lines. The Japanese system has 1,125 scanning lines.
   U.S. broadcasters are concerned that U.S. research efforts to
develop an industry transmission standard for high definition TV
may not be moving fast enough to head off a probable Japanese
invasion of the new technology.
   High definition TV is expected to be introduced by the Japanese
to homes in their country in 1990.

   Cuba is undertaking a major buildup of its
forces in Angola, raising the possibility of a joint Cuban-Angolan
offensive against U.S.-backed rebels, according to American
officials.
   With Cuban troop strength possibly exceeding 60,000, the
officials said Cuba may also be contemplating a cross-border strike
into South African-controlled Namibia, Angola's southern neighbor.
   The Cuban buildup, accompanied by an estimated two dozen MiG23
fighter jets, helicopter gunships, tanks and other equipment,
worries U.S. officials who have been hoping for a negotiated
withdrawal of the Cuban forces.
   Some officials believe that the Cubans may merely be attempting
to improve their bargaining position at four-way talks aimed at
achieving both a Cuban withdrawal and Namibian independence from
South Africa.
   But one official, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said
the sheer numbers of Cubans and equipment involved in the buildup
suggest that the Cubans are thinking more of a military offensive
than a withdrawal.
   ``The numbers are frightening,'' the official said.
   The buildup began several weeks ago with about one ship a week
loaded with troops and equipment undertaking the trans-Atlantic
crossing. If the U.S. estimates are correct, Cuba has increased its
troop strength by about 25,000 since last November.
   The four-way talks involve officials from Cuba, Angola and South
Africa, with the United States serving as mediator. The next round
will take place next week in the Congolese capital of Brazzaville.
   South Africa concluded the withdrawal of its troops from Angola
earlier this week and has said it will begin a withdrawal later
this year from Namibia provided Cuba agrees to an early pullout
from Angola.
   A South African pullback would set in motion a United Nations
plan for the establishment of an independent government in the
territory.
   The officials said the South Africans decided to withdraw from
Angola after recognizing that the Cuban buildup had changed the
power balance in the southern part of the country, leaving South
African troops vulnerable.
   They said South Africans may not even be a match for Cuban
forces in Namibia, where Pretoria has been the colonial power for
73 years. One official said Cuba has 50 percent more tanks in
Angola than South Africa has in its entire inventory.
   As one official described it, Cuban President Fidel Castro ``has
his eye on the history books,'' possibly hoping to free Namibia
from South African control and to help defeat the anti-communist
insurgency that has been operating in Angola for 13 years.
   The UNITA insurgency has received U.S. military support for the
past three years and controls much of the southeastern part of the
country.
   The four-way talks were convened last May in London at the
suggestion of U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker. At
the time, officials said the parties appeared eager for a
negotiated settlement, realizing that a military solution was
impossible.
   But some officials now believe that Cuba has had in mind a
military solution all along, and they say that theory has been
bolstered by the Cuban buildup.

   Pizza Hut will soon join Kentucky Fried Chicken
in bringing American fast food to China's capital.
   The American chain will open China's first pizza restaurant by
the end of the year, the official Xinhua News Agency reported
Thursday. Kentucky Fried Chicken, which opened in November, was the
first Western fast-food chain to open in China.
   The restaurant has been a big hit with the Chinese, who daily
buy the equivalent of 1,300 chickens. Business has been so good
that two more restaurants are planned in Beijing.
   The Amit Co. Of Hong Kong and the Beijing International Services
Co. signed the Pizza Hut joint venture contract Wednesday, Xinhua
said. The Amit Co. Will provide 60 percent of the $6 million for
the project, it said.
   Processing techniques and management expertise will be provided
by the Pizza Hut chain.
   Pizzas are now available in China only in hotels catering to
foreigners. The Pizza Hut restaurant will be the first to serve the
general public.
   The report did not say where the restaurant would be or how much
the pizzas will cost.
   Kentucky Fried Chicken, which has its largest restaurant in the
world in China, is southwest of central Beijing's Tiananmen Square,
overlooking Mao Tse-tung's mausoleum.

<HEAD>Airlines Fined More Than $1 Million for Poor Security Inspections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government imposed more than $1 million in
fines on 32 airlines for faulty airport security procedures as part
of a stepped up effort to improve passenger screening.
   The fines announced Thursday by the Federal Aviation
Administration range from $1,000 against a number smaller, mainly
commuter, airlines to $215,000 against United Airlines, $156,000
against Northwest Airlines and $113,000 against Delta Air Lines.
   While the passenger screening at airport checkpoints usually is
conducted by private security companies, the airlines hire the
companies and are responsible for the program.
   The fines stem from FAA tests conducted at major airports
nationwide in which agency inspectors carried phony weapons through
airport security checkpoints without being detected, the FAA said.
   FAA Administrator Allan McArtor said a recent audit of the
security tests conducted by the FAA showed improved screening, but
nearly 15 percent of the phony weapons still passed through
undetected.
   The 85.6 percent detection rate during the first six months of
the year compares with a 78.9 percent rate during all of 1987,
McArtor said. He added that some airport checkpoints detected more
than 95 percent of the weapons in the FAA tests, he said.
   But McArtor said that ``while the improvement in the detection
rate is encouraging,'' tough enforcement measures, including civil
penalties, are needed ``to insure industry-wide improvements and
system-wide safety.''
   Security lapses at airport checkpoints became a focus of
attention last year when a congressional report chastized the FAA
for the screening system's shortcomings.
   The subject gained additional attention after a disgruntled
former USAir employee smuggled a weapon aboard a Pacific Southwest
Airlines jet and began shooting, causing the plane to crash. All 43
people aboard the plane, which was flying from Los Angeles to San
Francisco, were killed.
   After the incident, the FAA announced it was using special teams
of investigators to test security at 16 major airports. Last March,
Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said the tests would improve
the effectiveness of the screening programs.
   ``We want to see a 100 percent success rate in detecting weapons
and dummy weapons,'' Burnley said in a statement Thursday. He
promised to continue the airport tests.
   McArtor, meanwhile, indicated that the FAA may seek additional
fines in the future if lapses are uncovered. ``We have no choice
but to take tough enforcement action in those instances where
security lapses are discovered,'' he said.
   Here are the airlines that were fined in the action announced
Thursday.
   United Airlines, $215,000; Northwest Airlines, $156,000; Delta
Air Lines, $113,000; American Airlines, $96,000; Continental
Airlines, $79,000; Eastern Airlines, $67,000; Trans World Airlines,
$63,000; Pacific Southwest Airlines, $61,000; USAir, $58,000; Pan
American World Airways, $51,000; Piedmont Airlines, $32,000; Alaska
Airlines, $31,000.
   Southwest Airlines, $21,000; Sky West Airlines and America West,
each $20,000; Hawaiian Airlines, $12,000; Wings West, Sun Country,
Braniff and American Trans Air, each $10,000; Air Wisconsin,
$3,000; Express Airlines, $2,000.
   The following airlines each were fined $1,000: Air America, Air
Midwest, Av Air, Brit Airways, ComAir, Florida Express, Horizon,
Jetstream, Midwest Express, Simmons.
   Pacific Southwest Airlines has merged with USAir since the FAA
tests that led to the fines were conducted, the agency said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Pinochet's Anti-Marxism Not Enough To Please
U.S.</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States normally casts a benign eye
on countries that welcome foreign investment, engage in free trade,
repay their debts, respect their neighbors and oppose communism.
   There aren't many countries with all these perceived virtues,
but one that does _ Chile _ has had a virutally unbroken record of
poor relations with the United States for 15 years.
   This seemingly anomalous situation has occurred because of
Chile's military president, Augusto Pinochet, whose human rights
abuses and distrust for democracy have more than offset aspects of
his rule which generally get an approving nod from Washington.
   Lately, the Reagan administration has adopted a friendlier view
toward Pinochet now that many civil liberties have been restored as
the country gears up for a presidential plebiscite next month in
which the 72-year-old general will be the lone candidate.
   Top military commanders announced their selection of Pinochet on
Tuesday, touching off a wave of protests that led to the deaths of
at least three people and the arrests of more than 1,000 others.
   While the United States has kept its distance, diplomatically,
from the general for years, Pinochet himself has been scornful of
Washington, telling American visitors that U.S. leaders should be
more appreciative of a government that deposed a Marxist-led
regime, an event virtually without precedent.
   Indeed, some American officials, citing Pinochet's economic and
foreign policies, believe long years of Reagan administration
hostility toward Chile was misguided.
   As an example, with the exception of Honduras, Chile sided with
the United States on more U.N. votes than any other Latin American
country during the last General Assembly session. Among all Third
World nations, only Turkey and Honduras were more supportive of
Washington's positions.
   Beyond that, while other hemispheric countries are mired in
economic crisis, Chile boasted a healthy 5.4 percent growth rate
last year, using market-oriented policies the U.S. advocates.
   And unlike many other hemispheric countries, Chile pays its
debts, allows foreign investors to remit profits and has been
selling off state-run enterprises.
   Also winning sympathy for Pinochet among some officials is the
presence of well-armed guerrilla groups which have staged repeated
terrorist attacks over the years.
   But at a time when the United States has been emphasizing
democractic development in the hemisphere, the administration felt
it could not make an exception by showing friendship toward
Pinochet.
   The administration's attempts to promote democracy in Nicaragua
would lose credibility if Chile were exempted from this policy,
officials contended, overriding those who favored greater
recognition of the positive side of Pinochet's rule.
   Beyond that, the Democratic majority in Congress, many of whom
have bitter memories of the early years of the Pinochet regime,
strongly oppose any accommodation with Chile.
   Whatever gratitude Pinochet generated in Washington for ousting
President Salvador Allende in 1973 was short-lived because of way
he dealt with those who opposed him.
   As outlined by Aryeh Neier, director of Americas Watch, a New
York-based human rights group, there were a ``huge number'' of
killings in Chile during those early years. ``Nobody knows the
actual count,'' he says.
   Some political activists disappeared without a trace and there
were widespread allegations that political detainees were tortured.
   American alienation from Chile was aggravated when U.S.
investigators blamed Chilean security agents for the 1976
car-bombing death in Washington of a former top Allende aide,
Orlando Letelier. This was one of the most notorious incidents of
international terrorism ever to occur on U.S. soil.
   A decade ago, Chile was a major target of the fresh emphasis on
human rights introduced by President Carter. Nowadays, the U.S.
focus is on democracy in the hemisphere and, at long last, the
prospect of the first genuine electoral test in Chile since 1973
has induced hopes in Washington that representative democracy may
return to Chile.
   Still, the long record of U.S. hostility toward Pinochet
contrasts sharply with the friendship the United States
demonstrated for years toward another Third World military
strongman, President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq of Pakistan, who was
killed in a plane crash two weeks ago.
   The records of both Zia and Pinochet on human rights are
similar. For Washington, the difference is that Zia ruled a
strategically important country and Pinochet doesn't.

   A mild protest or two is not out of the
ordinary at Sen. Dan Quayle's campaign appearances. Allegations
that the senator pulled strings to get into the National Guard
during the Vietnam War have prompted signs like ``War Wimp'' and
``Sissy Rich Boy'' to pop up here and there.
   But reporters who follow the Republican vice presidential
nominee have noticed that his hearing and vision are selective when
it comes to such displays, as he proved Thursday at one stop in
Arkansas, home of the University of Arkansas' Razorback Hogs.
   When Quayle walked to his car for the next appearance, a voice
from the crowd loudly shouted ``Chicken Hawk!''
   Quayle, apparently not hearing the taunt correctly, smiled and
gave a thumbs-up signal.
   ``Go Hogs!'' Quayle shouted back.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Dan Quayle has taken to referring sarcastically to
reporters as ``my newfound friends in the news media.'' But after
two weeks on the campaign trail, he still had not met the reporters
who covered him.
   Then, as Quayle's campaign plane flew Wednesday to Baton Rouge,
La., a particularly noisy group of photographers in the back of the
plane started a chant, in parody of a daytime television game show
announcer: ``Sen. Quayle, come on down.''
   Moments later, apparently by coincidence, Quayle came back to
meet the press.
   The session was, of course, off the record.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   There are campaign songs and campaign songs, but the one that
was piped over the public address system on Sen. Dan Quayle's plane
recently was loudly booed by an unappreciative audience of
reporters.
   Sung by Sylvia Johns, the song, entitled ``George Bush's Song,''
had an unmemorable tune and this sampling of lyrics:
   ``From Texas to the White House
   Is where Bush is gonna be
   Loyal to his country for American unity
   We the people of the USA
   Need a strong leader in the White House today
   It's Bush, George Bush
   He's everybody's All American.''
   The song was recorded in Baton Rouge, and complimentary 45 rpm
copies were distributed to the press, courtesy of Bengal Chemical
Inc., which the record jacket notes is a manufacturer of Bengal
Roach Spray.

   It was meant as a display of Dan Quayle's youthful athleticism,
but it took several tries for things to connect.
   Quayle helped the football team at Brandon High School in
Jackson, Miss., run a few scrimmage plays Thursday, taking the role
of quarterback for himself. The first pass was badly underthrown.
The second made it to the receiver, but glanced off his fingertips.
On third down, Quayle called for a new receiver and sent him out
for a 15-yard pass. That time, the two connected.
   Quayle, whose first two weeks as the GOP vice presidential
career were about as rocky as his passing, acknowledged that his
first pass was ``lousy.''
   ``It's just like a campaign,'' he said. ``It's getting better
and better.''

<HEAD>SEC Pays $145,000 in Another Sexual Harassment Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission paid
$145,000 to settle claims by a former employee that she had been
sexually harassed on the job, an SEC spokeswoman says.
   The payment was made late last month, with $112,500 going to the
former employee and $32,500 to her attorney, SEC spokeswoman Mary
McCue said Thursday night.
   The Washington Post in today's editions identified the woman as
Veronica Awkard.
   The payment came just months after a federal judge approved a
settlement ordering a promotion, back pay and compensation for
psychological counseling for Catherine Broderick, an SEC attorney
who the judge said had been forced to work in a ``sexually
hostile'' atmosphere at the agency's Washington regional office.
   Ms. McCue, who declined to discuss details of the most recent
case, said the two cases were unrelated.
   The Post said Awkard's allegations included reports of unwanted
physical advances and verbal invitations for sexual liaisons. It
said she left the SEC in July 1983.
   The Post said Ms. Awkard, then branch chief in the agency's
Office of Applications and Report Services, filed a sexual
harassment complaint in May 1983.
   Her complaint alleged ``the sexual harassment of me is a pattern
and practice of treatment ... resulting in females being denied or
awarded job benefits, including promotions, depending upon their
acquiescence with the supervisors' or managers' sexual approaches.''
   In June, District Judge John H. Pratt approved the settlement
worked out by attorneys for the SEC and Broderick. Pratt found that
in addition to working in a sexually hostile environment, Broderick
had been passed over for promotions and given a negative evaluation
because she complained.

   The Supreme Court on Thursday night stayed a
lower court ruling that had upheld contempt citations against four
Yonkers, N.Y., city councilmen for fighting a federally ordered
desegregation plan, a high court spokeswoman said.
   But in a related decision, the high court refused to stay a
contempt ruling against the city.
   The court granted stays to council members Henry Spallone,
Nicholas Longo, Edward Fagan and Peter Chema, court spokeswoman
Toni House said.
   ``The court has granted the stay for the four council members''
until they have had time to ask the court formally to fully review
their cases, Ms. House said.
   ``The application so far as the city of Yonkers is concerned has
been denied,'' she added.
   She said the entire court considered the applications, and
Justices Thurgood Marshall and William Brennan filed a 12-page
dissent.
   On Friday, a federal appeals panel upheld a judge's contempt
finding but gave the councilmen and Yonkers a week to seek an
emergency stay from the Supreme Court before reinstating the
penalties.
   The council members had faced $500-a-day fines and jail, and the
city could be hit with $1 million a day in penalties.
   In Yonkers, Mayor Nicholas Wasicsko said early Friday, ``It
seems at first curious that the fines would be stayed against the
councilmen yet run against the city. It troubles me. The treasury
of the city is going to be exposed and the taxpayers of the city
are going to feel the burden.
   ``One thing it denies is the political martyrdom of the
councilmen. They were slated to go to jail on Sunday. Their
personal fines have ceased. But the city is going to plummet to
bankruptcy. So their onus is their duty to the city. Their personal
political martyrdom has been denied them.''
   In Albany, N.Y., Tom Conroy, a spokesman for Gov. Mario Cuomo,
said, ``The governor will review the decision and confer with his
council. We won't have a comment before then.''
   Federal Judge Leonard Sand had found them in contempt Aug. 2,
the day after the council first rejected the court-ordered
desegregation plan by a 4-3 vote.
   The council members have refused three times to change their
votes on a zoning amendment needed to carry out a housing plan that
the council had accepted last January.
   Sand ordered the plan to remedy what he determined in a 1985
ruling to have been 40 years of deliberate segregation in housing
and education in the city.
   The plan calls for 200 low-income public housing units to be
built in the predominantly white east side of Yonkers, with 800
moderate-income apartments to be built throughout the city.

<TEXT>
   A Northwest Airlines jet that returned to
Detroit Metropolitan Airport after a bomb threat was called in was
evacuated, but no explosives were found on the plane, officials
said.
   The threat to Flight 333, bound for Los Angeles, was phoned into
the airline's reservation center here Thursday and relayed to the
control tower, said Nancy Mouradian, a spokeswoman for the Wayne
County Sheriff's Department.
   After the DC-10 landed and its 255 passengers were evacuated,
the plane was moved to an inactive runway, where explosive-sniffing
dogs and the sheriff department's bomb squad searched it. No one
was injured.
   Mouradian said she didn't know who made the threat or how much
time elapsed between the flight's takeoff and return.
   Bob Gibbons, a spokesman for the Eagan, Minn.-based airline,
said all information about the incident was being withheld.
   ``The airline has a standard reaction to bomb hoaxes. That is
not to respond to them unless they turn out to be something other
than a hoax,'' Gibbons said.

   Nine million Japanese climbed down ladders, ran
through smoke-filled tunnels and wheeled bedridden patients to
safety as the country rehearsed for a massive earthquake that
experts say could strike at any time.
   Thursday was the 65th anniversary of the Great Kanto Earthquake,
when a temblor estimated at 7.9 on the Richter scale jolted the
crowded plain surronding Tokyo and killed 140,000 people.
   Authorities hoping to hold down casualties in the event of
another massive quake mobilized schoolchildren, civic groups and
office workers for the tenth disaster prevention drill.
   Fire departments and officials from the National Land Agency and
local governments coordinated evacuation scenarios in the aftermath
of two imaginary temblors _ a second Great Kanto Earthquake of
magnitude 7.9 and a jolt along the heavily populated, 170-mile
Tokai belt linking Tokyo and Nagoya that would measure 8.0 on the
Richter scale.
   ``The number of participants doesn't change much, but each year
we've been getting better and better at holding the drill,'' said
Takanori Kobiki, head of the National Land Agency's Disaster
Prevention Operations.
   Scientists say Japan is likely to suffer a tremendous earthquake
within the next 20 years.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.

   The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration says it will conduct research aimed at coming up
with rules to protect the drivers of light vehicles from
unreasonable risk of rollover.
   The NHTSA decision was announced Thursday in a case centering on
the Suzuki Samurai, under attack from consumer groups for an
alleged tendency to roll over in curves.
   The safety board rejected a petition by the Center for Auto
Safety, a consumers group that wanted a recall of the Samurai,
saying the Samurai is no more likely to roll than other comparable
vehicles. The agency, however, approved a petition from the
Consumers Union to study the light vehicle rollover problem in
general.
   Suzuki responded to the decision by saying it showed that the
allegations against the Samurai were unfounded.
   ``The federal government's action supports Suzuki's claim that
the Samurai is safe and should put to rest the inaccurate and
misleading attacks on the vehicle,'' said a statement from the
Japanese company's U.S. subsidiary, American Suzuki Motor Corp. in
Brea, Calif.
   About 169,000 Samurais have been sold in the United States,
Suzuki said.
   The Center for Auto Safety, which is often at odds with
automakers and their regulators, said the decision skirted the
issue.
   ``If this were the law, then the Justice Department would refuse
to prosecute one mass murderer because there are other mass
murderers,'' the center said, citing reports of 113 rollovers, 120
injuries and 25 deaths involving the Samurai.
   The center said it would ask NHTSA to reconsider its decision.
   NHTSA said it granted the Consumers Union petition because that
request did not specify a single cause of Samurai rollovers and
acknowledged that factors other than the stability of the vehicles
lay behind some of the accidents.
   Many of the instances of rollover involving the Samurai happened
when the driver had been drinking, was unfamiliar with the vehicle,
or was attempting a risky maneuver, NHTSA said.
   NHTSA listed 10 research projects into vehicle stability it has
completed or plans to complete, but said the research does not
guarantee that new regulations will be issued.
   In rejecting the center's request for a Samurai recall, NHTSA
said the Samurai's rollover rate, based on a study of 1986- and
1987-model vehicles, was six per 100,000 vehicles. It said the Ford
Bronco II, by comparison, had a rollover rate of about 19 per
100,000 vehicles. The General Motors S-10 Blazer and S-15 Jimmy had
rollover rates identical to the Samurai's.
   The Consumers Union in June urged a ban on the Samurai and, in
its magazine Consumer Reports, rated the vehicle ``not
acceptable,'' the first such rating given an automobile in 10 years.
   The ensuing publicity cut into Samurai sales and resulted in
several lawsuits.

<HEAD>Jackson Denies Dukakis Campaign Wants To Keep Him Out Of Some
States</HEAD>

   Jesse Jackson says he will stress voter
registration, turnout and Democrat Michael Dukakis as he travels
around the country in the two months before the presidential
election.
   ``I will campaign for voter registration and voter turnout in
every state that I can get to,'' Jackson said Thursday, denying
reports some Dukakis aides had suggested he stay out of states
where the former civil rights leader has a high negative rating.
   ``In some instances we'll speak directly for, as a surrogate
for, the ticket,'' Jackson said, while elsewhere he will be
representing the party or his own Rainbow Coalition.
   Jackson, in Atlanta for a meeting to plan voter registration
strategy, told reporters he would focus hard on family farmers,
unions and students because, ``I would hate to wake up on the
morning of Nov. 9 (the day after the election) and hate to think
that we lost by the lack of my work.''
   Jackson and other Democratic officials downplayed reports of
continuing tension between the two camps, attributing any to the
normal process involved in campaigns. But, Jackson said, ``there's
no lingering tension.''
   ``There are always problems during a campaign ... but I haven't
seen any evidence that a great divisiveness exists,'' said Jackson
adviser Bert Lance, the former federal budget director.
   Thursday's meeting, attended by about 70 party workers and
officials from around the Southeast, was called by Jackson's
Rainbow Coalition to discuss voter registration.
   Jackson described the gathering as ``a very positive meeting, a
very hopeful meeting.''
   Those attending the meeting included Jackson workers and
strategists, mainly from the Southeast, Larry Harrington, Dukakis'
Southern political director, and state and national party officials.
   Harrington said the party had made ``a significant and a
successful effort'' to involve Jackson supporters at all levels of
the campaign.
   ``I don't really think there's a serious problem, but if he
(Jackson) identifies some problems, then we'll work with him,''
Harrington said.
   Some of the attendees included Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga.;
California Assemblyman Willie Brown, Jackson's former campaign
manager; New Mexico Gov. Toney Anaya; Texas Agriculture
Commissioner Jim Hightower; Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young; Georgia
party executive director Bobby Kahn; and Dukakis' state campaign
director, Mike deVegter.
   Sources close to Jackson had said Wednesday that the former
presidential candidate was angered at being told by Dukakis aides
to avoid campaigning in Michigan, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia,
Texas, New York and Alabama.
   Jackson said Thursday he would set his own schedule for the fall
and ``keep pressing for the priorities we fought for in our
campaign.''
   Before Thursday's meeting in Atlanta, Joseph Gardner, operations
director in Jackson's Chicago office, said, ``Basically, the
transition has been smooth. ... It's obviously not easy to
integrate a campaign organization that was autonomous.''
   Gardner said Georgia was among the states where the problems
were most serious. He said the Jackson camp ``had thought Georgia
was a model,'' but then the Rev. Cameron Alexander, a Jackson
backer, took his name off the list of nine co-chairs of the state
Dukakis campaign. Alexander said the state Democratic Party was
giving only token attention to blacks.

   Here are some comments Thursday from the
presidential campaign trail:
   
   GEORGE BUSH, on a trip to dramatize the pollution in Boston
Harbor: ``Two hundred years ago tea was spilled in the Boston
harbor in the name of liberty. If tea were spilled in the Boston
Harbor today, it would dissolve in the residue of my opponent's
neglect and delay.''
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, saying Bush had a hand in the Reagan
administration's elimination of remedial math and reading programs
for poor children: ``Where was George while all this was going on?
Where was the man who now says he wants to be the `education
president?' He was playing hooky. He was nowhere to be found.''
   
   DAN QUAYLE, touring a Timex plant in Little Rock, Ark.: ``I'm
still ticking. I'm going to continue to talk about the issues. It
is an upbeat campaign.''
   
   JESSE JACKSON, saying why he will campaign hard between now and
the Nov. 8 election: ``I would hate to wake up on the morning of
Nov. 9 and hate to think that we lost by the lack of my work.''
   
   PAUL BROUNTAS, Dukakis campaign chairman, after failing to agree
with Bush forces on a schedule for debates between the presidential
and vice presidential candidates: ``The American people ... should
not have to choose between watching the nominees debate world
events and watching the World Series.''

   A mild earthquake hit Nepal today, 12
days after a strong quake that killed hundreds of people, but there
were no reports of damage or casualties, scientists said.
   The quake registered 4.8 on the Richter scale, according to
seismologists. They said it was recorded at 3:45 a.m.
   They described the tremor as an aftershock of the 6.5 quake Aug.
21 that killed more than 1,000 people in Nepal and India.
   Like that quake, the epicenter of today's quake was in Udayapur,
20 miles north of the India-Nepal border.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage.

Drought</HEAD>

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Meteorologist Milo
Radulovich crawls out of his pup tent each morning at 4 to see if
the weather will bring any relief to firefighters working in the
scorched pines of Yellowstone.
   But the prognosis, here and across much of the tinder-dry West,
is bleak on the eve of Labor Day weekend after a drought-plagued
summer that has produced the most devastating fires in the park's
history.
   ``We're dead in the water through the 10th of September,''
Radulovich said Thursday.
   He picked up a national weather chart and pointed toward the
Pacific. No major storms were in sight to bring moisture to the
parched forests of Wyoming and Montana, and temperatures were
expected to be above normal, perhaps in the 90s, for at least the
next five days.
   The only bright spot: Calm winds were expected, which could
limit the spread of flames.
   The weather outlook means more long days for firefighters
battling six major blazes in Yellowstone, which have charred more
than a half-million acres of the 2.2 million-acre park this summer.
   Yellowstone reopened its south gate Thursday for the first time
in almost two weeks, meaning all five park gates were usable. All
park roads also were open, though officials said worsening fire
conditions could cause temporary closures.
   Elsewhere in the West, fires continued to burn woodland and
brush in Montana, Utah, Washington, Oregon, Idaho and California.
   Weather determines if a fire will crackle quietly along the
forest floor or rage explosively through the tree tops. Forecasters
like Radulovich try to keep firefighters a few steps ahead of
Mother Nature.
   He is one of about 20 National Weather Service forecasters who
specialize in ``meso-meteorology'' _ the art and science of making
pinpoint predictions based on broad-brush weather charts.
   ``We take those, together with observations in the field, and
bring it down to the scale of 100,000 acres,'' he said.
   Based in Sacramento, Calif., Radulovich, 60, is assigned to
western Yellowstone's North Fork fire, which has burned more than
109,000 acres since it entered the park July 23.
   His early start each day gives him a chance to review the latest
national weather map, which comes in via a small satellite dish
next to his tent.
   His office, a few steps away, is the cab of a rental truck
parked in the midst of a bustling firefighters camp at
Yellowstone's Madison Campground.
   Radulovich makes his predictions after checking instruments that
monitor temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction.
   He and his assistant, Jeanne Hoadley, work closely with Dave
Thomas, a U.S. Forest Service fire management officer who compares
weather conditions with what he knows about the forest's dryness.
   They brief firefighting officials at 6 a.m., then return to the
van to prepare the next forecast.
   There may be two to four briefings a day, between which
Radulovich and Thomas squeeze in field trips to check local wind
patterns, temperatures and other variables. Their day typically
ends at about 11:30 p.m.
   Yellowstone's fires are thriving on a steady diet of low
humidity, high temperatures and forests baked dry by the area's
worst recorded drought.
   ``I've worked on fires for 21 years, and I've never seen things
so dry,'' said Thomas, who is based in western Montana's Lolo
National Forest.
   Fuel moisture, a measure of how much water the wood contains,
has dropped at times to 3 percent in Yellowstone _ about the same
as kiln-dried furniture, Thomas said.
   Predicting the weather's effects in such a fire-prone area is
tricky business.
   Canyons can funnel winds, accelerating them until they pump up a
fire ``like a blacksmith's bellows,'' Radulovich said. Temperature
inversions can make smoke hug the ground.
   Radulovich has been forecasting weather for forest fires since
1962 and is among the best at interpreting the quirky little kinks
that can throw off predictions, Thomas said.
   ``You have to be accurate or you don't survive in this kind of
forecasting,'' Radulovich said. Firefighters who work close to
blazing timber take calculated risks based largely on what they
think the wind may do.
   ``Their confidence in you is really important,'' Radulovich
said. ``They make decisions of life and death.''

   French authorities said a ship carrying
toxic waste and rejected by half a dozen countries will be
resupplied and refueled at sea but will not be allowed to enter a
French port.
   The cargo ship Karin B, loaded with 2,100 tons of industrial
solvents, was denied permission to enter French waters and dock at
Le Havre, at the mouth of the Seine River.
   The ship anchored off the Normandy coast, where it was being
closely watched by two French naval vessels, officials said
Thursday.
   As a storm blew in the English Channel, with winds whipping at
more than 60 mph, the Karin B took up a position 12 nautical miles
off the coast, said officials at France's Operational Search Center
for Rescue and Salvage in Jobourg.
   According to the martime affairs office in Cherbourg, ``the
commander of the ship wanted to come to Le Havre to resupply before
leaving for the sea, but the French authorities proposed
resupplying at sea in the next few hours.''
   The Karin B's wastes, originally from Italy, were dumped
secretly and illegally in Nigeria, then removed in two shiploads by
contractors for Italian authorities.
   The German-owned ship has been refused permission to unload its
cargo in Britain, Spain, West Germany and the Netherlands. The
Italian government says it does not have the technology to dispose
of the toxic solvents.

   Helicopters delivered the remains
of 21 people killed in a fiery commuter plane crash to friends and
relatives waiting at the airport in this Pacific port.
   About 300 people gathered Thursday night to identify the
victims, who died when the aircraft plunged into the western Sierra
Madre mountains Wednesday, said Victor a Bauza Orosco, a Red Cross
worker.
   ``It's difficult. The bodies are badly deformed, and some
arrived in pieces, only limbs. Others are thoroughly burned,'' he
said.
   Rescue workers said all 21 people aboard the twin-engine plane _
including 18 passengers and three crew members _ died when the
plane fell into the rocky, heavily forested terrain near the town
of Arteaga, about 200 miles southwest of Mexico City.
   Aviation officials said the Brazilian-made Bandeirante aircraft
of the Aerofederal line disappeared after leaving Uruapan, about
180 miles west of Mexico City, for the 100-mile flight to Lazaro
Cardenas.
   Gen. Carmelo Teran, chief of staff of the 21st Military Zone _
whose members participated in the rescue _ said the bodies and
wreckage were found within a radius of about 50 yards.
   He said the plane crashed at the juncture of two mountains. Most
of the passengers were from Uruapan.
   A helicopter of the Federal Electricity Commission spotted the
wreckage at 9 p.m. Wednesday, but rescuers could not fly into the
area until late Thursday morning, after trees were cleared in the
dense forest. Teran said rescuers climbed two or three hours
through the rugged terrain to reach the crash site, which was three
to four miles from the nearest road.
   He said they also were slowed down by rain.

   A California Air National Guard
helicopter on a training exercise crashed and burned on a ridge of
a Mojave Desert mountain range, killing all six crew members,
authorities said.
   The crew of the HH-3 search-and-rescue helicopter that went down
Thursday was made up of four Guardsmen and two Air Force officers
on a training mission from George Air Force Base, said Sgt. 1st
Class Carolyn Hamilton, spokeswoman at National Guard headquarters
in Sacramento.
   ``We do not know the cause of the crash. That is being
investigated,'' said Air Force Tech. Sgt. Jorge Caballero.
   The helicopter was from the 129th Air Rescue and Recovery Group
based at Moffett Naval Air Station, about 35 miles south of San
Francisco, and was participating in a training exercise at George
when it went down, Ms. Hamilton said.
   The helicopter was almost obliterated by the crash and fire,
authorities said.
   The Air Force officers were identified as 1st Lt. James R.
Dooley and 1st Lt. Patrick L. Henry, both of the 27th Tactical Air
Support Squadron, said Air Force Sgt. Sarah Hood. Hometowns and
ages were unavailable.
   Names of the other victims were withheld for notification of
relatives.
   The helicopter, a craft called a ``Jolly Green Giant'' with a
capacity of 25 passengers and 16 litters or 5,000 pounds of cargo,
picked up the Air Force crewmen at George for search and rescue
training, Caballero said.
   The crash site was about about 30 miles northeast of the base
and 18 miles southeast of Barstow in the Cinder Cone region of the
Rodman Mountains, said San Bernardino County sheriff's spokesman
Jim Bryant. Barstow is 95 miles northeast of Los Angeles.
   California Highway Patrol Flight Officer Ken Davis, who reached
the crash site in a CHP helicopter, said the National Guard craft
crashed on a ridge.

   Swedish patrol boats fired depth
charges for the second time this week in a narrow inlet where
officials believe a foreign submarine is trapped, a defense
spokesman said.
   The spokesman, H.G. Wessberg, said it was not clear if anything
was hit Thursday.
   Indications of an intruder were discovered over the weekend in
the Stig Fiord, 27 miles north of Goteborg off the western coast.
Swedish ships fired depth charges in the area Monday.
   Wessberg said it was impossible to seal off the fiord, but he
said the navy increased patrols in the outlets of the three straits
in the area in hopes of trapping any submarine that might be there.
   The navy previously has used nets to seal off waters suspected
of harboring alien submarines.
   Foreign submarines have been reported in Swedish waters
repeatedly for the last seven years. The government, citing lack of
proof, has refused to name the country it believes is violating its
territory. Experts have said tracks left on the ocean floor
indicate the vessels were Soviet.

   Angolan government soldiers killed 153
rebels in a week of fighting across six provinces, the official
Angolan News agency ANGOP reported.
   ANGOP quoted a Defense Ministry statement Thursday as saying 11
Angolan soldiers were killed, 37 wounded and two listed as missing
in the actions that began Aug. 24 and ended Tuesday.
   Rebels of UNITA, the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola, are not participating in a cease-fire signed Aug. 22
between Angola, South Africa and Cuba formally ending hostilities
in southern Angola.
   UNITA, supported by the United States and South Africa, has been
fighting since 1975 to force the Cuban- and Soviet-backed Angolan
government to share power.
   The ANGOP report, monitored in Lisbon, said government troops
also captured five guerrillas, along with arms and ammunition, and
freed more than 100 civilians allegedly being held captive by the
rebels.
   The Defense Ministry said rebels had killed 25 civilians,
wounded 35 and kidnapped 11 others in guerrilla actions over the
same period.

   Chinese and Soviet officials today said they
found some common ground in just-concluded talks on Cambodia but
achieved no breakthroughs in resolving the 10-year Cambodian
conflict.
   ``I'm satisfied with the negotiations we've had,'' Soviet Vice
Minister Igor Rogachev told reporters at the airport. ``We have now
more common points, but that does not mean we have no points of
difference.''
   The Chinese deputy foreign minister, Tian Zengpei, said the
talks, which ended Thursday, were ``beneficial in deepening the
mutual understanding between the two countries on their positions
on Cambodia.''
   Rogachev and Tian, speaking to reporters at the airport before
Rogachev's departure for Moscow, both refused to go into detail
about the differences.
   The five-day meeting in Beijing was the first time the two sides
have met solely to discuss Vietnam's 10-year occupation of
Cambodia. Upon his arrival in Beijing on Sunday, Rogachev said he
thought a breakthrough in resolving Chinese-Soviet differences on
Cambodia was at hand.
   The Cambodian problem is the major barrier to normalization of
relations between the two communist giants and to their first
summit in 29 years. The nations severed relations in the early
1960s over strategic and ideological differences.
   China, the chief backer of the anti-Vietnamese resistance in
Cambodia, has called on the Soviet Union, which supports Vietnam,
to pressure Hanoi for an early and total withdrawal of its troops.
   Vietnam in May agreed to withdraw 50,000 troops by the end of
this year and its remaining forces by 1990.
   China has repeatedly expressed doubt over the sincerity of the
Vietnamese promise, and Tian was skeptical about next year's
pullout.
   ``We will wait and see what they do,'' he said.
   According to Tian, the Soviets agreed ``in principle'' with
China's stand that a four-party coalition government, made up of
the three resistance factions and the Hanoi-established government
in Phnom Penh, should be set up following Vietnam's withdrawal.
   Rogachev said only, ``We will approve the decision that will be
taken by the (Cambodians) themselves. (They) must decide.''
   Rogachev said the Cambodian issue will be taken up by the Soviet
and Chinese foreign ministers at a meeting in New York later this
month.
   He added that another round of talks would be held next year,
but a date and place have not been decided.

<HEAD>Nobel-Winning Physicist, Developer Of Dinosaur Extinction Theory,
Dies At 77</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NY6</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nobel Prize-winner Luis W. Alvarez, a
brilliant, wide-ranging physicist who helped develop the atomic
bomb and a controversial theory that asteroids or comets wiped out
the dinosaurs, has died at age 77.
   Alvarez died at his home in this San Francisco Bay college town
late Wednesday after a long battle with cancer, it was announced
Thursday.
   Colleagues described Alvarez as a scientific Renaissance man
whose colorful career took him from wartime radar systems to UFO
sightings, secrets of an Egyptian pyramid and an analysis of the
assassination of President Kennedy.
   ``Luis Alvarez was a stunningly creative individual,'' David A.
Shirley, director of Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, said Thursday.
``His discoveries and inventions spanned an amazing range of the
frontiers of man's knowledge over more than half a century.''
   Alvarez, who worked at the laboratory and the University of
California, died of complications from operations for esophageal
cancer, laboratory spokeswoman Mary Barberia said, quoting the
physicist's widow, Janet.
   His health had declined since surgery for a benign brain tumor
last fall, the spokeswoman said.
   Alvarez won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1968 for developing
the liquid-hydrogen bubble chamber and for discovering numerous
atomic particles with the device. The chamber is filled with a
transparent liquid so that charged particles and their collisions
can be studied by photographing the bubbles and boiling that occur
along their paths.
   In the late 1970s, Alvarez made headlines with the theory that
asteroids or comets striking the Earth 65 million years ago killed
the dinosaurs by kicking up huge, dense clouds of dust and smoke.
   Alvarez and colleagues who developed the hypothesis, including
his geologist son Walter, argued that the clouds blocked sunlight,
lowering temperatures, destroying food plants, and resulting in the
extinction of dinosaurs and many other species.
   The theory, which challenged the long-held view that dinosaurs
were unsuited for survival in the Darwinian evolutionary scheme,
triggered a bitter scientific debate that continues to this day.
Others argue that volcanic eruptions killed the dinosaurs by
darkening the sun.
   Alvarez labeled one critic ``a weak sister,'' and accused others
of ``publishing scientific nonsense.''
   His theory got a boost last week when new evidence from a study
of ancient clay was reported in the British journal Nature.
   The hypothesis has a chilling modern-day counterpart: a theory
that that an atomic war would produce enough smoke to plunge Earth
into a cold, dark ``nuclear winter'' that would wipe out any
survivors.
   Alvarez, a San Francisco native, was the son of Walter C.
Alvarez, a noted physician and medical columnist at the Mayo Clinic
in Rochester, Minn.
   He wrote in his 1987 autobiography, ``Alvarez, Adventures of a
Physicist'' that he was indebted to his father, who told him it was
a good idea to take a night off now and then to do nothing but
think.
   As an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, Alvarez built
one of the first Geiger counters in the United States. As a
graduate student, he used it to study cosmic rays and proved
radiation from space consists mostly of protons.
   He began working at Berkeley in 1936. His discoveries included
the capture of electrons by atomic nuclei and the radioactivity of
tritium, an isotope of hydrogen used in thermonuclear weapons.
   During World War II, Alvarez invented an effective bomb sight
and a number of radar systems. His invention of a ground-controlled
approach landing system saved the lives of many Allied pilots, some
of whom thanked him after the war, according to California-Berkeley.
   Alvarez played an important role in developing the atomic bomb,
and invented several types of atom smashers.
   In his autobiography, he nostalgically recalled the early days
of atomic research, when he held a sphere of radioactive plutonium
in his hands, ``feeling its warmth.''
   Alvarez made news by applying physics to popular subjects,
including the X-ray scan of an Egyptian pyramid for hidden chambers
_ there were none _ and analysis of evidence in the Kennedy
assassination. His findings supported the Warren Commission's
conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone assassin.
   University of California President David P. Gardner said
Thursday that he and the entire university community were saddened
by the death of Alvarez, whom he called ``a creative and energetic
scientist.''
   Gardner said Alvarez showed ``concern for the student,
commitment to meaningful and distinctive research, and devotion to
the betterment of society. `He will be missed.''
   Alvarez is survived by his wife, Janet, two sons, two daughters,
two sisters and a brother.

<HEAD>Stocks Rebound, Dollar Edges Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar edged up marginally against the Japanese
yen Friday, while share prices recovered nearly one-third of the
losses of the previous day on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar, which opened at 136.25 yen, finished the week's
trading at 136.75 yen, up 0.05 yen from Thursday's closing.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the Tokyo stock
market's main barometer, closed at 27,116.50, up 182.24 points or
0.67 percent from the previous session.
   Dealers attributed the stock market's recovery to the dollar-yen
rate, which was seen as stabilizing after the dollar's steep rise
the previous day.
   ``Investors were buying a little more than yesterday, but some
investors are still cautious, waiting to see the U.S. report on the
unemployment rate,'' said a stock dealer at a major securities firm
in Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Labor Department was to release national unemployment
figures for August later Friday in Washington.
   The yen's recovery was attributed to the dollar's 0.20 yen
decline overnight in the United States, but a dollar-buying drive
remained strong among investors, leading the dollar to ``rise
slowly but surely,'' according to a foreign exchange dealer at the
Bank of Tokyo.
   ``Finance Minister Miyazawa's comments on the yen-dollar rate
(Thursday and Friday) have made investors stay away from the yen,''
he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Miyazawa said Thursday that the yen's downswing was nothing to
worry about, and after a news conference Friday morning said he saw
no need to change Japan's current monetary policy.

<HEAD>Grosz: Strikes Not The Correct Action to Express Demands</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Poland, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Karoly Grosz said 300 miners
who staged a rare strike in southern Hungary had lawful demands,
but he warned against other work stoppages.
   In a speech on Miners' Day, an annual fixture in the Soviet
bloc, Grosz on Thursday shifted blame from his communist government
to the management of the Komlo mine for failing to meet miners'
grievances.
   Workers at the Komlo mine, about 100 miles south of Budapest,
went on strike Aug. 23.
   The miners complained that a personal income tax introduced in
Hungary on Jan. 1 sliced annual bonuses by 30 percent to 50
percent. The tax is part of Grosz's efforts to curb an $18 billion
foreign debt and stimulate the economy.
   Workers returned to the job after the government promised to try
to resolve the problem over the tax.
   Officials said the strike, the first worker challenge to Grosz's
stringent eoconomic policies, was ``regrettable'' but
understandable in view of economic hardships under a government
austerity program.
   ``For the non-payment of the full sum of bonuses due ... the
responsibility'' belongs not to the government but ``on the local
management which took a wrongly interpreted economic and political
decision,'' Grosz said.
   ``We are looking into this question and will try to find a
solution,'' the official MTI news agency quoted him as saying.
   Grosz, who told the meeting he was in favor of radical reforms
to heal the ailing economy, criticized company managers of not
``economizing correctly on the funds available for dsitribution''
among the miners.
   But in a clear warning and in a bid to curb other potential
strikes, Grosz said he did not believe ``threats would produce any
results.''
   ``I would contest that ... the stopping of work would provide
the correct emphasis to express political demands ... as there are
also those who believe that by using such methods they can acquire
undue advantages,'' Grosz was quoted as saying.
   The strike coincided with labor unrest in Poland. Hundreds of
Polish miners work in Hungarian shafts. But the official media did
not say if any Poles were involved in the 20-hour stoppage at the
Komlo mine.
   The mining industry in Hungary has been crippled for at least 10
years due to producion lags, financial problems and a growing labor
shortage.
   Hungary's official trade unions have been critical of recent
economic policy, emphasizing that workers, retirees and the
unemployed must be protected against inflation, already at 18
percent this year.

<HEAD>Debate Over Presidential Debates Continues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The debate over presidential debates remains
unresolved.
   Campaign managers for Democrat Michael Dukakis and Republican
George Bush failed on Thursday to agree on how many face-to-face
encounters the candidates should have.
   Both sides held to positions taken earlier this week when Bush
campaign manager James A. Baker III offered two televised
presidential debates and Dukakis manager Paul Brountas pushed for
three.
   However, the Bush campaign appeared to nudge the schedule back
by a few days and pushed for an open format as opposed to sticking
to specific topics.
   Unlike the earlier meeting, which was conducted in person in
Washington, Thursday's negotiating session was on the telephone.
The two sides did agree to talk to each other again on the phone on
Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. says he's ready
to hit the campaign trail for Democratic presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis if he's asked, according to a published interview.
   In the first interview since being hospitalized in February for
brain surgery, the 45-year-old Delaware Democrat said that he'll
return to Washington next week to resume his Senate duties, the
Wilmington Morning News reported in Thursday's editions.
   Biden, who dropped out of the 1988 Democratic presidential race,
said the only item on his current political agenda is re-election
in 1990.
   ``Running for president is not in my plans,'' he said. ``I
sincerely hope Dukakis wins and there is not a choice until 1996.''
   Biden also told the newspaper he has no lingering anger at
Dukakis or the news media at being forced out of the presidential
race despite admission by former senior Dukakis aide, John Sasso,
that he provided information leading to stories charging Biden with
appropriating speech material without attribution and exaggerating
his academic achievements.

   Parker Bros. has asked a Republican group
to stop using the ``Get Out of Jail Free'' card from its
copyrighted Monopoly game as part of a campaign that takes a swipe
at Michael Dukakis and a Massachusetts prison furlough program.
   Patricia McGovern, a spokeswoman for Parker Bros., said the
College Republican National Committee did not seek the company's
permission to use a replica of the Monopoly card.
   ``Under no circumstances would he have allowed this,'' she told
The Boston Herald on Wednesday. ``We will immediately send them a
letter ordering them to cease and desist the copyright
infringement.''
   The Washington-based committee said it has handed out 100,000 of
the cards and planned to issue another 100,000. The card is
virtually identical to the ``Get Out of Jail Free'' card included
in the popular board game but has the added note: ``Compliments of
Michael Dukakis.''
   Susan Brackin, executive director of the Republican
organization, said the group did not seek permission from Parker
Bros. to use the card because ``we're not selling them. We're just
using them as parody.''

   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo says the 1988
presidential race has been the most ``superficial'' he's ever seen
and he's blaming the Republicans for it.
   Democrat Cuomo said attempts by Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, the Democrats' presidential hopeful, to discuss the issues
have generated little media interest. Republicans, meanwhile, have
been using negative campaigning to get their message across in
support of Vice President George Bush, Cuomo said.
   ``What are the issues so far? Pledge of Allegiance, furloughs,
death penalty. Are you kidding?'' Cuomo said on a flight from
Albany, N.Y., to Quantico, Va., on Thursday. ``This is so far the
most superficial (campaign) and it is because Republicans have made
it that way. The Republicans are not talking about any big issues
so far.''
   Later, during a speech at the FBI training academy here, Cuomo
added, ``Look what they're talking about, Quayle and the National
Guard. My God, we have a $2 trillion debt.''
   Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, Bush's running mate, has been under
fire for allegedly using family influence to get into the National
Guard and avoid serving in Vietnam.

   It's a year late, but the National Education
Association says that Vice President George Bush has finally
completed an assignment given to all presidential contenders last
summer: a detailed questionnaire about schools and other issues.
   ``We need to spend more on education,'' Bush wrote. ``Providing
an excellent education is an investment in America's future _ and
it is one of the most basic roles of government.''
   ``The tone is much more positive than we had anticipated,'' said
NEA President Mary Hatwood Futrell. But she gave the Republican
presidential nominee an ``Incomplete'' because he did not respond
directly to some of the 20 questions the NEA asked on issues
ranging from education to Social Security to a nuclear freeze.

<HEAD>Band Of French Cars Cruise Into Beijing From Paris</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the flap of the French tricolor and the pop
of champagne corks, 27 French automobiles cruised around Tiananmen
Square today to celebrate the completion of the first
Paris-to-Beijing car rally.
   The rally began July 12 in Paris and covered more than 11,000
miles through 12 countries.
   The participants, 58 men and 10 women, from France, Belgium and
Germany, crossed ``deserts, some rainy places, rivers, plateaus and
many, many mountains to reach our goal,'' said Alain Lafeuillade,
the trip's organizer.
   They also bumped into combat troops in Iraq and braved the roads
of Pakistan, where ``the drivers are like a crazy Frenchman who's
late for dinner,'' said Christophe de Scheemaecker, a 23-year-old
from Antwerp, Belgium.
   The trip marks the first time that a car rally of this size has
bridged Europe and Asia, Lafeuillade said. The last time such a
feat was attempted was the 1931 Yellow Crusade of Citroen, which
was abandoned after many of the cars broke down in mountainous
Pakistan. The drivers rode out on camels.
   This time, driving the Renault 5 or the Peugoet 205, the
roadsters averaged 10 hours a day behind the wheel for a total of
about 600 hours each.
   ``A lot of the time we spent driving by ourselves, stopping in
places that interested us and then catching up with the rest of the
pack,'' de Scheemaecker said.
   Once in Yugoslavia, after 17 hours straight behind the wheel, de
Scheemaecker lost control of the vehicle and it smashed into a
mountainside.
   ``We thought we had to leave the race, but a mechanic flew in
from Belgium and we were back on the road after a day,'' he said.
   In all, four of the original 31 cars didn't make it to Beijing,
two dying in the mountains of Pakistan and two more falling victim
to the Chinese deserts _ the Gobi and the Taklamakan.
   Karine Hervieu, a 21-year-old travel agent from Brittany,
France, remembers an encounter with Iraqi troops 62 miles from the
warfront with Iran.
   ``We gave them a message of peace,'' she said. ``For us, it was
a very important moment.''
   Babette Shily, 28, from Paris, remembers leaving Pakistan and
finding out that two days later President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq had
been killed.
   ``We always seemed just a day or two ahead of disaster,'' she
said. ``It was the same in India, too.''
   Days after some of the cars left northern India, an earthquake
hit both India and Nepal, killing hundreds.
   ``We saw everything on this trip. Floods, droughts, soldiers,''
Shily said.
   Hervieu said most of the trip the drivers were allowed to go
wherever they wanted, except in Syria, Iraq and China.
   ``We could understand Iraq because they have a war and Syria
wasn't a problem because it was so brief,'' she said, ``but the
Chinese have gone too far with their control.''
   Hervieu and others said the Chinese forced them to drive in a
single line once they crossed into China from Kunjirap, Pakistan.
   ``It's like one big parade, they won't let us break away,'' she
said.
   The participants, aged 18 to 30, were all responsible for
raising their own money for the trip, organizers said.
   ``They worked in banks, restaurants, whatever,'' Lafeuillade
said. ``Then they'd get a garage to sponsor them and _ poof _
they'd be on the road.''

   The dollar inched up marginally against the
Japanese yen today, while share prices recovered nearly one-third
of the losses of the previous day on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar, which opened at 136.25 yen, finished the week's
trading at 136.75 yen, up 0.05 yen from Thursday's closing. The
currency ranged between 136.23 yen and 136.78, with spot volume
estimated at $4.54 billion.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the Tokyo stock
market's main barometer, closed at 27,116.50, up 182.24 points or
0.67 percent from Thursday, when the index closed at a 431.69-point
loss.
   An exchange dealer at a major commercial bank in Tokyo said the
dollar ``was firm and edging up gradually'' in the absence of
action by Japan's monetary authorities.
   ``The market reaffirmed Japanese monetary authorities will do
nothing about the dollar's recent rise, creating for further
yen-selling drive,'' said the dealer who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a news conference today
that no change in Japan's monetary policy is necessary at the
moment, and currency yen-dollar dealings are mostly speculative and
will soon settle down.
   Seichiro Kita of Daiwa Securities Co., a major Japanese
securities brokerage, said the stock market ``regained much
confidence today after the Nikkei index recovered above the
27,000-point level, due partly to relative stability of exchange
rates.
   The Tokyo market was looking to the latest monthly statistics of
U.S. employment data, to be released later today, Kita said.

<TEXT>
   A ``gung-ho'' Navy lieutenant accused of
dereliction of duty in the drowning of a rescue-swimmer trainee was
acquitted in the court-martial he sought in an effort to exonerate
himself.
   ``All I can say is the military (justice) system worked,'' a
smiling Lt. Thomas Torchia said after the verdict Thursday night.
``The system that charged me found me innocent.''
   A four-officer panel found the 32-year-old Princeton, Ill., man
innocent of two counts of dereliction of duty after deliberating 3{
hours in the weeklong trial.
   Torchia was in charge of the Navy Rescue Swimmer School at the
Pensacola Naval Air Station when Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki, 19, of
Appleton, Wis., died March 2 in a training pool.
   Instructors threw a panic-stricken Mirecki back into the pool
after he climbed out and shouted that he wanted to quit the
voluntary training, witnesses said.
   Mirecki, who had a phobia about being pulled under water,
suffered a fear-induced heart attack before drowning, a Navy
pathologist testified in Torchia's trial.
   A panel may be selected today for the court-martial of a second
defendant, Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael Combe, 28, of Tempe,
Ariz., who is accused of holding Mirecki's head under water. He
faces more serious charges of involuntary manslaughter, battery and
conspiracy to commit battery.
   Torchia had been offered unspecified non-judicial punishment,
but turned it down and sought the court-martial in an effort to
clear his name.
   If convicted, he could have been fined two months pay, been
reprimanded and lost seniority for promotion. The penalty would
have put Torchia's career on the line, said a defense lawyer,
retired Navy Capt. Ferdinand Salomon.
   Torchia said he plans to stay in the Navy, and expects a new
assignment soon as an aviation maintenance officer.
   Torchia, whom a prosecutor described as a ``gung-ho rescue
swimmer,'' said he hoped the highly publicized Mirecki case hadn't
caused people to lose faith in Navy training, which he called the
best in the world.
   Torchia was acquitted largely because of the testimony of a
prosecution witness, said one of his defense lawyers, retired Navy
Capt. Ferdinand Salomon.
   Lt. Cmdr. Steve Matthews, a water survival and aerospace
physiologist, testified for the prosecution Wednesday that brute
force and high-stress tactics used at the school were unnecessary
and counterproductive.
   In closing arguments, Salomon pointed out that Matthews and
other training officers had been working for months since the
drowning to correct problems plaguing the school long before
Torchia took over.
   ``Yet Lt. Tom Torchia, an ordinary flight officer who is not a
training expert and who had been on the job only 83 days is being
branded a criminal for not figuring it all out,'' Salomon said.
   Testimony indicated several of Torchia's superiors had visited
the school, but that no one raised objections to procedures or
questioned safety until after the death.
   In his closing argument, the lead prosecutor, Lt. Cmdr. Larry
Wynne, said Torchia should not have been excused by following
long-established procedures.
   The defense's position was, ``If it had been that way before, it
was OK,'' Wynne told the panel.
   ``Each man is responsible for his own watch,'' Wynne said,
urging the panel to put aside any empathy they may have for a
fellow officer and decide the case according to military law.
   After the verdict, prosecutors immediately left the courtroom
and were unavailable for comment.
   Besides the two court-martial cases, the investigation also led
to non-judicial punishment for five other Navy men, including a
letter of reprimand to Torchia's former boss, now-retired Capt.
C.L. Lavinder who had headed the Naval Aviation Schools Command.

<HEAD>Measles Going Back Down For First Time In Four Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After three years on the increase, measles is on
its way down again, but health experts say it's too early to tell
if the disease might finally be on the decline for good.
   The national Centers for Disease Control said Thursday that
3,652 cases of the once-common childhood disease were reported in
1987, down 42 percent from the previous year. It's the first drop
in measles reporting since the record low of 1,497 cases in 1983.
   Measles has fallen 99 percent since the era before measles
vaccine was licensed in 1963, and the disease was thought headed
for eradication when the record low came in 1983. But the case
count then surprised researchers by going back up in 1984, '85 and
'86.
   Researchers cannot say just what the latest drop in measles
really means, said Dr. Bradley Hersh, a CDC measles specialist. The
disease could continue to show ``little peaks and valleys'' for the
next decade, he noted.
   ``We don't really know,'' he said. ``We feel now that the
vaccine is very good and very effective, but there are problems we
are having _ in the people unvaccinated in the inner cities, and
the vaccine failures in the school-age children.''
   The CDC said 1,010 of the cases, or 28 percent, were
theoretically preventable, occurring in people who should have been
vaccinated, but weren't _ mostly preschool children in urban areas.
   Nearly three-fourths of the cases _ 2,642 _ were classified as
non-preventable, occurring in patients who had been vaccinated but
got measles anyway; most of those patients were older
schoolchildren.
   ``We've got two fronts,'' Hersh said, ``the (young) kids in
those preventable cases, and the vaccine failure in older
children.''
   The Atlanta-based agency said Thursday its expert consultants
still believe the elimination of measles in the United States
``should be pursued,'' but the two lingering problems _ the
non-vaccinated and the vaccine failures _ will ``require different
solutions.''
   ``Increased efforts are needed to vaccinate preschool-aged
children,'' particularly in inner-city areas, the CDC said in its
weekly report. ``Innovative strategies are needed to increase
immunization levels in these populations.''
   Meanwhile, the CDC said, ``aggressive revaccination strategies''
may be needed during measles outbreaks to eliminate the so-called
non-preventable cases in already-vaccinated children.
   Such a revaccination would involve a rapid program of additional
shots for most children vaccinated before 1980, when new
vaccination recommendations and new vaccine techniques began to
improve the protection somewhat, Hersh said.
   Twenty-nine percent of last year's cases occurred among patients
under 5; another 29 percent occurred in the 15-19 age group.
   Researchers have reports on how two-thirds of the patients got
the measles; 53 percent of them acquired the disease in primary and
secondary schools, while others picked it up in day care,
universities, at home or in other settings.
   Three-fourths of the cases _ 2,759 _ were reported from eight
locations: New York City, 469 cases; California, 809; Texas, 452;
New Mexico, 318; Illinois, 213; Missouri, 190; New Hampshire, 162;
and Wisconsin, 146. Fewer than 9 percent of the nation's counties
reported measles cases.

   A U.S. military jet crashed today in a remote,
forested area in northern Japan, but the pilot bailed out safely
and was taken by helicopter to an American military base, officials
said.
   The pilot of the F-16C, Maj. Wyman E. Vanedoe, was listed in
good condition soon after the crash, the U.S. Forces Japan Media
Liaison Office in Tokyo said. Vanedoe's home town was not
immediately available, said a U.S. official who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Isao Teranagare, spokesman of Iwate Prefecture (state) Police,
said the pilot was taken by a Japanese rescue helicopter to the
U.S. Air Base at Misawa in northern Japan.
   No one else was aboard the fighter, he said.
   The U.S. aircraft, belonging to the 14th Tactical Fighter
Squadron at Misawa, was on a routine training flight with two other
F-16s in partly cloudy skies when it crashed in a forested area in
Iwate, police said.
   Iwate is about 290 miles north of Tokyo.
   The cause of the crash was under investigation.
   On March 22, 1987, another F-16 crashed in the Pacific Ocean off
Misawa, 360 miles north of Tokyo. In that crash, the pilot also
bailed out and was rescued by a helicopter.
   The F-16, a powerful air-to-surface fighter, has a combat range
of about 575 miles, according to Jane's ``All The World's
Aircraft.''
   About 50 F-16s are stationed at Misawa. Misawa is located about
440 miles south of a Soviet military base near Yuzhno Sakhalinsk on
the island of Sakhalin.

   Officials say the Federal Communications
Commission and the Justice Department have begun a crackdown on
manufacturers and distributors of illegal devices used with
satellite dishes to unscramble cable television and other pay TV
programming.
   The FCC said Thursday authorities have begun making arrests and
seizing equipment in their efforts against video pirates who peddle
the devices.
   FCC official Richard Smith estimated that nearly half of the one
million satellite dishes used to receive pay TV programs have
illegal devices that unscramble the picture, and let the viewer
watch for free.
   Smith said although the agenicies have targeted manufacturers
and distributors, individual home viewers using the devices are
acting illegally and are subject to criminal and civil penalties if
caught.

   An Interior Department official says he's
confident that California offshore oil production could double by
1992.
   William Bettenberg, director of the department's Minerals
Management Service, said Thursday that permits have already been
granted for platforms off the coast of California which should
bring the total production to 200,000 barrels to 225,000 barrels a
day.
   Current California production is about 100,000 barrels a day,
nearly twice the 53,700 barrels a day in 1981 and almost quadruple
the 27,900 barrels a day in 1980.
   There are currently 16 producing platforms in federally
controlled waters, by 1992 there should be 22 in operation after
additions and retirements, officials said.

   If the United States and Soviet Union wants to
pace the cuts in their nuclear arsenals they should halt production
of a key component of nuclear weapons, according to a group of arms
control specialists.
   In an article published today in the journal Science, the group
called for stopping further production of tritium, a hydrogen
isotope that decays at a rate of 5.5 percent yearly. Tritium is a
component of the modern, compact nuclear warheads deployed by the
superpowers.
   A nuclear weapons scientist from Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory, however, responded that the proposal poses numerous
problems and could complicate U.S.-Soviet arms talks.
   Advocating the ``Tritium Factor'' as a means of arms control
were four specialists, headed by J. Carson Mark, associated with
the Nuclear Control Institute, a Washington-based policy group.
Mark is former leader of the theoretical division at Los Alamos
National Laboratory.

   A 200-pound gorilla made an
``impossible'' escape from its enclosure at the Kansas City Zoo by
scaling a wall, forcing the evacuation of about 200 people,
authorities said.
   The 13-year-old gorilla, named Molly, climbed the wall,
clambered onto a roof and then jumped down to walk into the ape
house entrance normally used by humans.
   At the time, there were no people nearby, said zoo Director
Ralph Waterhouse. The zoo was closed for about 1{ hours and about
200 people evacuated as workers dealt with the gorilla.
   Workers at the zoo locked the ape house doors and blocked them
with trucks and closed other openings with plywood. The gorilla was
then tranquilized.
   ``It still appears to be impossible,'' Waterhouse said about the
escape. ``She is extremely athletic.''
   Earlier in the summer she propped a skinny tree branch in the
corner of her outdoor exhibit and climbed to another brief spell of
freedom.

<HEAD>Most Vietnam Vets Escaped Heavy Exposure to Dioxin, Study Suggests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A veterans group criticized a new report by the
federal Centers for Disease Control that suggests most Vietnam GIs
escaped heavy exposure to the poison dioxin, unless they handled
the herbicide Agent Orange.
   ``This study seems to be pretty much the same data that was
released a year ago, only a year ago it was portrayed rather
differently,'' said Barry Kasinitz, a spokesman for the
35,000-member Vietnam Veterans of America.
   The CDC last year concluded that exposure to dioxin could not be
determined using military records of troop locations and spraying
of Agent Orange, which contained the deadly poison.
   ``Now ... they are jumping to the conclusion that very few
people were exposed,'' Kasinitz said Thursday in a telephone
interview from Washington. ``That was a bit of a jump in logic that
doesn't seem to be substantiated.''
   The CDC's new report, in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association, describes a comparison of blood tests between 646
Vietnam veterans and 97 non-Vietnam veterans.
   ``Current TCDD (dioxin) levels were nearly identical in Vietnam
and non-Vietnam veterans,'' the researchers said.
   The latest study deliberately drew Vietnam veterans from
battalions that had served in areas most heavily sprayed with Agent
Orange around Saigon in 1967 and 1968, the CDC said.
   Only two Vietnam veterans, or 0.3 percent of all 646 tested, had
blood dioxin levels greater than 20 parts per trillion, considered
``clearly elevated,'' the researchers said.
   ``These two men each reported their health status as `excellent'
and did not attribute any health problems to Agent Orange
exposure,'' the researchers added.
   The two men were not among the 14 percent of the Vietnam
veterans in the study group who did link health problems to
exposure.
   ``This study is consistent with other studies and suggests that
most U.S. Army ground troops who served in Vietnam were not heavily
exposed to TCDD (dioxin), except perhaps men whose job involved
handling herbicides,'' the researchers said.
   But Kasinitz said the new report gives the ``unfortunate''
impression that small exposures to dioxin were harmless, which has
not been proven, ``and that there is no need for the government to
act to assist those that have been harmed.''
   Dioxin stays in the bloodstream for many years, and high levels
of the chemical can be measured with blood tests as long as two
decades after someone has been exposed, the researchers said.
   Agent Orange was used as a defoliant in Southeast Asia during
the 1960s by the U.S. military. Some Vietnam veterans contend it
has caused them such health problems as cancer, immune system
disorders and birth defects in their children.
   The U.S. Supreme Court just two months ago cleared the last
legal obstacle to a multimillion-dollar settlement that could
benefit up to 250,000 Vietnam veterans in a class-action lawsuit
against the seven manufacturers of Agent Orange.
   But scientists are still trying to settle a continuing
controversy over exactly what health effects the dioxin in Agent
Orange may have.
   Dioxin is known to be one of the most powerful causes of cancer
in laboratory animals ever tested. It has not been shown to cause
cancer in humans, but the Environmental Protection Agency
classifies it as a probable carcinogen.

<HEAD>River In Dhaka Rises To Record Level</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A swollen tributary of the Ganges River
in the capital today reached its highest level in 34 years,
officials said, as soldiers and volunteers worked to build dams
against the rising waters.
   At least 64 people died nationwide since Thursday, bringing to
748 the nationwide death toll from floods that began with the
monsoon rains in June, newspapers reported today.
   The flood waters swept away children, sank boats, and leveled
houses, newspapers reported. Scores of people died after being
bitten by snakes that had crawled to higher ground, they said.
   No deaths were reported in Dhaka, where flood waters ranged from
several inches downtown to 6 feet on the outskirts.
   Hundreds of thousands of people left their water-logged houses
in Dhaka, many moving in with relatives or into government shelters.
   Highways and rail lines remained under water, while drinking
water supplies were cut off in 12 outlying districts of Dhaka
because the pumps were submerged, according to city officials, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   By this morning, the Buriganga River was nearly 3 inches above
flood stage _ its highest level in 34 years, said the Flood
Forecast and Warning Center. It predicted the river would rise
another 8 inches by nightfall.
   Some low-income city residents have started hoarding food, but
there were few other signs of panic, officials said.
   ``There is no shortage of food right now, but the water is
making transportation virtually impossible,'' President Hussain
Muhammad Ershad told reporters Thursday.
   As the river threatened to engulf the city, the army and
volunteers shored up a dam along the 10-mile road leading from
Dhaka to the town of Narayanganj. Students from Dhaka University,
which shut down until Sept. 15, joined the relief effort.
   At Dhaka airport, foreign airlines were advised to delay flights
today because a part of the main runway was covered with 1 to 2
inches of water, said an airport official. Smaller domestic planes
used a short, dry part of the strip to take off and land, said the
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   There has been little rain in Dhaka in the past week, but the
Buriganga rose quickly as flood waters from the north of the
country surged south.
   A ferry with about 700 people aboard sank Wednesday night at the
dock in Chandpur, about 40 miles southeast of Dhaka, and five
people were missing and feared dead, police in Chandpur said.
Salvage workers entered the ferry Friday and found no bodies, the
police said.
   In 1987, more than 1,500 people died in the annual monsoon
floods. In 1985 more than 10,000 were killed when cyclones and
tidal waves hit islands in the Bay of Bengal, about 130 miles south
of Dhaka.

   Airboats fanned out over Lake Okeechobee
for the first statewide alligator hunt in 26 years, a 30-day
reprieve aimed at thinning out the once endangered species whose
thick hides fetch $42 a foot.
   ``We could have filled our 15-gator limit tonight,'' Warren
Schafer boasted about four hours after the hunting season opened
Thursday night. He displayed his prey: three gators ranging from
seven to 10 feet long.
   ``It wasn't as hard as other animals I've hunted,'' said
Schafer, 45, of Miami, a veteran big-game hunter.
   Across Florida starting at sundown, more than 200 hunters
selected by the state began to search for their red-eyed prey with
flashlights and head lamps.
   Harpoons, snares and bows and arrows are about the only weapons
permitted. Most alligators are taken alive, their jaws secured with
duct tape, and are delivered to processing plants still kicking.
Some are killed with a ``bang-stick,'' a device that shoots a
cartridge on impact. Guns are prohibited because the gators often
sink after being shot.
   On Lake Okeechobee, hunters, reporters and a few sightseers
departed under the din of airboats and through a mist churned up by
their large propellers. Bugs fluttered about like snowflakes in the
hunters' lights.
   Thomas Alpern, 25, a free-lance writer from New York City, said
to be the only Northerner who received a permit, was still
searching for his first alligator at midnight with the aid of a
professional trapper.
   ``Who knows?'' he said. ``Maybe I won't even be able to kill it
once we find one.''
   But Alpern, like many hunters, couldn't ignore the profitable
side of the hunt. In addition to the lucrative hides, gator meat
sells for up to $6 a pound.
   ``The money is the big factor,'' said Rodney Crawford, a
19-year-old cook from Lake Worth, who will hunt on Lake George in
Florida.
   State game officers are closely monitoring the hunt for poachers
and permit-holders using illegal weapons or taking gators below the
4-foot minimum length.
   Since federal anti-poaching methods were adopted in 1970, the
alligator population in Florida has about doubled to an estimated 1
million. Nearly 1,000 gators have been captured in experimental
hunts since 1981, and the September season will be isolated to 28
districts where the alligator population is extraordinarily high.
   Tom Stice, a biologist with the state Game and Fresh Water Fish
Commission, said a cross section of the public was sought for the
hunt to expand interest in alligators.
   The 238 hunters, selected from about 5,000 applications,
attended a six-hour, state-sponsored training session and signed
liability waivers.
   Stice estimated the hunters will capture 65 to 70 percent of the
possible maximum of 3,450.
   For state wildlife officials, the hunt follows a nearly 20-year
effort to preserve the Florida alligator, which averages about 10
feet in length.
   The last state-approved hunt for sport was in 1962, when the
American alligator was declared endangered and hunting alligators
in Florida was banned. As its numbers increased, however, officials
downgraded the alligator from endangered to threatened and the
state gradually relaxed hunting restrictions.
   ``People are getting gator phobia,'' said Lee Kramer of Delray
Beach, who captures nuisance alligators for the state. ``I got a
call the other day in Boca (Raton) and it turned out to be an
inflatable pool alligator that blew into a ditch.''
   Allan Woodward, head of alligator research for the game
commission, theorized that the alligator population was not as
decimated as previously thought during the height of poaching in
the 1960s.
   ``They've really surprised us,'' he said. ``They're a pretty
hardy animal.''

<HEAD>Whitworth Espionage Convictions, Sentence Affirmed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court upheld the
espionage convictions and 365-year prison sentence of ex-Navy
radioman Jerry Whitworth, a member of the Walker spy ring that
passed military secrets to the Soviets.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 3-0 Thursday that
the punishment fit Whitworth's crime of selling ultra-sensitive
Navy decoding and communications information to the Soviet Union.
   The sentence imposed by U.S. District Judge John Vukasin
``viewed in the abstract ... would appear harsh,'' the court said.
``This sentence, however, is not disproportionate to Whitworth's
crimes.''
   Whitworth, 49, of Davis, Calif., a radioman with a top-secret
clearance for much of his 18-year Navy career, was convicted in
1986 of seven counts of espionage for supplying ultra-sensitive
decoding and communications information to spymaster John Walker
for nearly a decade, in exchange for $332,000.
   Vukasin called Whitworth ``one of the most spectacular spies of
the century'' and imposed the nation's harshest sentence for
espionage since Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, convicted of conspiring
to furnish atomic bomb secrets to the Soviets, were electrocuted in
1953.
   Whitworth's sentence forbids parole consideration for 60 years.
In the decision, the court rejected defense arguments that a
sentence longer than Walker's amounted to cruel and unusual
punishment.
   Military and intelligence officials testified at the trial that
the spy ring had revealed the Navy's most precious secrets and
caused damage that may be impossible to calculate.
   Walker also recruited his son and brother as members of the spy
ring. He pleaded guilty in a Baltimore federal court to spying for
the Soviets for 17 years and was sentenced to life in prison, with
parole possible in 10 years.
   The opinion by Judge Robert Boochever said the U.S. Constitution
does not require a judge in one court to compare a defendant's
relative guilt to that of a defendant in another court on separate
charges before imposing sentence.
   Even if comparison of guilt was required, Boochever said, ``the
court notes that Whitworth kept Walker's espionage operation alive
for nearly a decade and himself became a central figure because of
his access to highly classified material.''
   Whitworth's chief prosecutor, former Assistant U.S. Attorney
William Farmer, commented, ``The sentence was not harsh at all. If
this had been a case where there was a death penalty available, it
clearly would have been prosecuted as a capital case.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Sanford Svetcov, who represented the
prosecution on appeal, agreed that Whitworth deserved a death
sentence, which was abolished for espionage and other federal
crimes by a 1972 Supreme Court ruling.
   ``It's a sickness in our society, that we have people willing to
do harm to their own country for money,'' Svetcov said. ``These
guys were not Communists by any means. They were strictly in it for
profit.''
   Whitworth's lawyer on appeal, Alan Caplan, said he was
disappointed by the ruling and would appeal. He said he was
``astounded'' by the court's conclusion that the verdict was not
influenced when Walker was improperly allowed to speculate on the
witness stand that Whitworth must have known the secrets were being
delivered to the Soviet Union.
   Walker, also a former Navy radioman with a top-secret clearance,
testified that he had started selling secrets to a Soviet agent in
1968 and recruited Whitworth as his chief supplier of classified
materials in 1974, after Walker himself no longer had direct access
to the material.
   Whitworth was convicted of furnishing to Walker the secrets of
Navy decoding equipment, code keys and communications systems that
Whitworth gathered and photographed for nearly a decade as a highly
placed radio officer at ship and shore stations.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has refused to halt
mounting daily fines against the city for blocking a federal
housing desegregation plan, a decision the mayor says could cause
Yonkers ``to plummet to bankruptcy.''
   But in a ruling issued Thursday night, the court temporarily
spared the four city councilmen who oppose the plan from going to
jail until they have time to ask formally that their cases be fully
reviewed, U.S. Supreme Court spokeswoman Toni House said.
   The justices stayed a lower court ruling that had upheld
contempt citations against the four councilmen, who had faced a
resumption of $500-a-day fines and the start of jail terms this
weekend.
   The city's fines for failing to comply with the desegregation
order were put on hold until today, pending the Supreme Court's
ruling. The fines will now resume against the city, Yonkers Mayor
Nicholas Wasicsko said.
   The fines started Aug. 2 at $100 and doubled daily. The city had
paid $12,700 before receiving its first stay from an appeals court,
which upheld the contempt finding last Friday but granted an
additional one-week stay. It also capped the city's fines at $1
million a day.
   House said the entire court considered the applications from the
councilmen and the city, and ``the application so far as the city
of Yonkers is concerned has been denied.''
   Justices Thurgood Marshall and William Brennan filed a 12-page
dissent, arguing that all stays be denied, she said.
   ``As the city repeatedly points out in its application, `Yonkers
is relatively unique in that most of the governmental power in the
city is centralized in the legislative branch.' For this reason the
city IS the council,'' Marshall wrote.
   The ruling surprised Wasicsko, who favors compliance with the
desegregation order.
   ``It troubles me,'' he said early today. ``The treasury of the
city is going to be exposed and the taxpayers of the city are going
to feel the burden.
   ``One thing it denies is the political martyrdom of the
councilmen. They were slated to go to jail on Sunday. Their
personal fines have ceased. But the city is going to plummet to
bankruptcy.
   ``So their onus is their duty to the city,'' he added. ``Their
personal political martyrdom has been denied them.''
   Two of the four defiant councilmen _ Nicholas Longo and Vice
Mayor Henry Spallone _ said early today that the decision, for
them, was a major victory.
   ``This country went through a revolution a couple hundred years
ago to make sure that people could cast their votes independently
and without coercion,'' Longo said.
   Councilman Peter Chema, another one of the four, called the
decision ``a big personal victory, but I have serious concerns
about the city. It's kind of like being administered oxygen while
someone strangles you.''
   The fourth councilman, Edward Fagan, called the decision
``unexpected'' and declined to comment further.
   Longo said the four would ask U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand,
who initially found them in contempt, to suspend the city's fines
pending their Supreme Court hearing, which Longo said would not be
until 1989.
   ``The relief becomes moot if he decides to bankrupt the city in
the interim,'' Longo said.
   Longo and Spallone refused to say if they would allow the city
to go bankrupt rather than change their votes.
   In 1985, Sand found the city liable for 40 years of segregating
housing and schools and ordered the city to build 800 units of
moderate-income housing throughout the city.
   Sand found them in contempt Aug. 2, the day after the council
first rejected the court-ordered desegregation plan by a 4-3 vote.
They've rejected the plan by the same vote three times since.
   Bertran F. Wallace, president of the Yonkers branch of the
National Association of Colored People, one of the plaintiffs in
the original suit against the city, said this morning he was not
very familiar with the ruling.
   ``Our greatest concern is to see that the court order issued by
Judge Sand is carried out and implemented and that we build the
homes ... in a very peaceful and orderly manner,'' he said.
   The state Emergency Financial Control Board, which has taken
control of the city's spending, had said it would seek criminal
charges against the four councilmen today if the fines are
reimposed.
   Spokespeople said this morning that Gov. Mario Cuomo and
Secretary of State Gail Shaffer, who chairs the control board,
would not comment until they had seen the high court's ruling.
   The criminal charges stem from violating the control board act _
a state law _ by jeopardizing the city's finances through spending
money the city they were not authorized to spend.
   Kevin Condon, spokesman for a citizens' group called COMPLY,
which supports compliance with the desegregation order, said ``the
ruling is one final indication that the city needs to face reality
and get on with putting its life back together.''
   The city and councilmen had a tentative court appearance with
Sand set for 2 p.m. today. It was not known how the Supreme Court
ruling would affect the schedule.

   Police said today they were
investigating whether some missing bullets meant for an Olympic
shooting competition may be in the hands of terrorists.
   They said customs officials in the southern city of Pusan
unsealed a container on a ship and discovered that 400 rounds of
ammunition were missing. The Japanese-registered Trans World
Bridge, which was loaded in Britain, docked in Pusan on Thursday.
   Police said the ship sailed from Britain on Aug. 31 with 25,000
rounds of ammunition for the shooting competition.
   They said they were investigating whether the bullets may have
been turned over to terrorists trying to disrupt the Olympics,
which are to to be held in Seoul from Sept. 17 to Oct. 2.
   Security has been one of the prime concerns surrounding the
Games, and stiff measures are being enforced near all ports of

<HEAD>Carlucci: Congress Must Help Reform Procurement Process</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER BRANDLON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci warned
Congress not to act hastily to change the way it reviews defense
spending in the wake of a major fraud probe involving defense
contractors and consultants.
   Lawmakers should not adopt reform proposals being circulated on
Capitol Hill, including creation of an independent acquisition
agency, removing the inspector general from the Department of
Defense and locking the ``revolving door'' between the DOD and
defense contractors, Carlucci said on Thursday.
   ``Certainly, we want to see those found guilty of wrongdoing
punished, and punished severely, for their actions ... but reform
is really about prevention, not punishment,'' Carlucci said.
   The speech before the Baltimore Council on Foreign Affairs was
the most comprehensive statement to date by the secretary since
revelations of a widespread investigation of alleged fraud
involving defense contractors and consultants.
   In his ``prescription for procurement reform,'' Carlucci called
on Congress to simplify its budget-making process, reduce the
number of committees that oversee defense spending, shift the
Pentagon budget to a two-year cycle and provide multi-year funding
for more weapon programs.
   The goal should be to limit the number of ``intervention points
where a skillful lobbyist can succeed'' in gaining an advantage, he
said.
   ``Right now, the defense budget bill must complete a 17-step
process to final passage,'' Carlucci said. ``Each point along the
way is an opportunity for those bent on exerting improper
influence.''
   Congress must seek ways ``to reduce the profusion of
intervention points on (Capitol Hill) that invite improper _ if not
always strictly illegal _ behavior,'' he said.
   However, Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee, said the speech failed to address central
issues of procurement.
   ``Since the procurement scandal erupted, we have seen people
selling old ideas that have nothing to do with the procurement
problem,'' Aspin said. ``They are pet rocks dressed up as solutions
to the scandal. But they are still pet rocks. I am afraid Secretary
Carlucci has fallen into the same trap in his speech billed
`prescription for procurement reform.
   ``His proposal dealt with budget reform, not procurement reform.
His suggestions say nothing about the use of consultants, the abuse
of insider information, or restoration of the integrity of the
bidding process,'' the congressman said.
   ``Many of his suggestions for budget reform are valid and have
been pushed by me and others over the years. But they have nothing
to do with procurement reform,'' Aspin said.
   The Justice Department investigation, which became public in
June, centers on allegations that defense contractors routinely
used outside consultants to obtain proprietary information on the
bids of competitors, and that the consultants may have paid bribes
to Pentagon employees.
   Carlucci warned against a ``legislative rush'' to enact reforms
without considering their effects.
   ``At the very least, DOD's critics owe us a hearing before they
try to pass legislation that could impact our procurement process
and the defense industrial base for years to come,'' he said.
   ``We need to ask: How does the system as it exists today offer
wrongdoers the opportunity to act _ and how can we close these
windows of vulnerability in the procurement process?''
   Carlucci said establishment of an independent acquisition agency
by Congress would erect barriers between the acquisition process
and those in the Pentagon who know best what weapons they need.
   Likewise, the defense department relies on the ``revolving
door'' that brings experts from the industry into government,
Carlucci said.
   ``We need to police the system for abuses, not penalize
procurement professionals for seeking to build on and benefit from
their expertise,'' he said.
   As for the suggestion that the inspector general should be
removed from the DOD, Carlucci said it would ``deprive the
secretary of defense of the eyes and ears that help him monitor the
system he is charged with supervising.''
   The Pentagon already has acted to prevent contractors from
winning contracts unfairly by streamlining its own acquisitions
chain of command, Carlucci said.

<HEAD>House Arrest Program Changed After Controversy Over Zaccaro</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANICA KIRKA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vermont no longer will let convicted drug
dealers take part in a house arrest program under which John
Zaccaro Jr. is spending his four-month cocaine trafficking term in
a $1,500-a-month luxury apartment.
   ``Hallelujah!'' said Addison County States Attorney John Quinn
upon learning of Gov. Madeleine Kunin's announcement Thursday.
   ``I never considered that drug dealers were non-violent
offenders. I never thought they should be in the house arrest
program no matter who they are,'' said Quinn, who prosecuted
Zaccaro and opposed his entry into the program.
   The changes do not apply to those already in the house arrest
program, including Zaccaro, the 24-year-old son of former vice
presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro.
   Kunin's announcement followed public outcry over the disclosure
that Zaccaro was living in the maid-service apartment while in the
program.
   The house arrest program allows non-violent criminals to find
and pay for their own housing and spend their sentence outside of
prison while under strict supervision.
   Zaccaro was convicted in April of selling $25 worth of cocaine
to an undercover police officer. He was sentenced to four months in
prison, but spent only 29 minutes in the Chittenden Community
Correctional Center in July before moving to the Montpelier
apartment.
   Kunin defended the program overall, saying it provided the
necessary element of punishment and helped to reduce overcrowding
in Vermont's prisons. However, she said, the program must exclude
drug dealers.
   ``We must have confidence, public confidence in the system,''
she said. ``I also feel that we have to send a very strong message
in terms of drug offenders.''
   Under the changes, program participants also must spend at least
24 hours in traditional incarceration before moving to their
house-arrest residences.
   Kunin said many assumptions about drug offenses have changed
since the original program guidelines were drafted in 1983.
   ``Instead of considering this to be a low to moderate offense as
it had been in the past, it should be moved up because I think
anyone who sells drugs anywhere in the world, in this country, in
the state of Vermont, is a serious offender,'' Kunin said.
   Corrections Commissioner Joseph Patrissi, however, told Kunin
that a review of similar house arrest programs in eight other
states found none barred drug offenders.

   Louie, an Alaskan King Crab, is just
getting a leg up in the racing game, but he'll be seasoned in a
Maryland crab derby Saturday.
   Louie, dubbed King Louis the 49th by Alaska officials, is in the
field of competitors from 31 states in the Governor's Cup race at
the 41st National Hard Crab Derby and Fair at Crisfield, Md.
   Alaska won the Governor's Cup in 1968, 1972 and 1980, but crab
handicappers have their doubts about Louie. They say he may be too
big and ungainly to cover the 16-foot course ahead of the smaller
blue and Dungeness crabs entered by other states.
   ``You're talking about an animal that is large, with a heavy
body weight,'' said Bill Nippes of the Alaska Department of Fish
and Game. ``Take it out of the water and you change the buoyancy.
Crabs are very slow on land. Dungeness crabs are a lot faster,
quicker.''
   So are Chesapeake Bay blue crabs, Nippes said. Maryland offers
those to crabless states. Those entries include the Cheese State
Streaker from Wisconsin, Colorado Super Collider, Ethan Allen's
Revenge from Vermont, Peanuts from Georgia, Crabby Curt from
Michigan and Koa o Ke Kai from Hawaii.
   ``That means `Warrior of the Sea,''' said Claude Brooks of the
Maryland Office of Tourism Development. ``I hope that's what it
means. I hope it isn't something obscene.''
   Maryland is famous for its crabs, but none of its entries has
won in the 41-year history of the derby said race coordinator Ruth
Custis.
   Maybe the Maryland blues know something about the post-race
festivities the other crabs don't.
   ``We eat them,'' Custis said, laughing. ``We put our famous
seasoning on them and have a feast.''

<HEAD>Teen-Age Inventor Seeks His Fortune Through Uncommon Windshield
Wiper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH SHOGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While many other 18-year-olds are thinking about
college courses, Alonzo J. Haney III is thinking about windshield
wipers and the idea of becoming a millionaire.
   Haney invented a windshield wiper that already has caught the
eye of General Motors Corp. He also has his own company, HMI Inc.,
which he says is backed by more than $1 million in investments.
   Not bad for a teen-ager who earned ``C's'' in high school
science.
   Haney, who goes by the nickname Chip, puts himself in some
respectable company _ with inventors like Thomas Edison.
   ``They're inspirational, they defy odds and I guess that's what
I am doing right now,'' he said in an interview Thursday at his
company's spacious Chicago office.
   ``When I look out this window, I think a lot about what space of
the sky I want to go after next,'' said the youth, who lives in the
suburb of North Chicago.
   His path to fortune began simply. He was driving his car to pick
up his mother from work one rainy day in October 1986 when he
noticed the windshield wipers didn't work well.
   ``I took out a pad of paper and a pen and I started to sketch
out new ideas of a better wiper blade,'' Haney recalled.
   That night, the made the first prototype out of a garden hose at
home.
   Haney says his wiper can scoop rain, ice and snow off a
windshield and toss the debris as far as four feet. It is specially
designed to hug the windshield more closely than traditional
wipers, he said.
   When he found out he would have to pay about $10,000 to hire an
attorney to file a patent application, Haney decided to do the
research and application himself.
   His patent was approved, and Haney marched into GM's executive
offices in Detroit the day after he graduated from high school last
year to persuade the giant automaker to use his wiper on GM cars.
Company officials have promised to test it.
   Haney is putting the final touches on a contract with Alofs
Manufacturing Co. of Grand Rapids, Mich., which will make and
distribute his invention.
   ``We're hoping to have it (the contract) complete and signed
next week,'' said Alofs owner Eugene DeFouw.
   DeFouw said Haney's earnings would be based on the number of
wipers sold. In addition to GM, he said, a few Japanese automakers
have expressed interest. Meanwhile, he has invented 28 other
products, five of which have patents pending, he said.
   ``I spend about 18 hours a day thinking about what I want to
make,'' Haney said. ``I don't date, I don't have time for that
right now.''
   In his office hang two paintings, which Haney said tell a lot
about what motivates him.
   One depicts a young black man, shirtless and hunched over,
struggling to be taken seriously.
   ``Now I can be accepted as an equal, but 40 years ago, you
wouldn't have found me in this office,'' said Haney, who is black.
   Another painting is of a man playing polo.
   ``I love polo because it's very challenging and not everyone can
do it _ just like not everyone can be 18 and own a company,'' Haney
said.
   Joseph N. Stephenitch, who taught Haney in business classes at
Warren Township High School in suburban Gurnee, said the youth
``has a scary grasp of business.''
   Haney's mother Patricia, 43, also is proud of her son.
   ``But it does worry me that he's not with his own age group,''
she said. ``He is missing out on a lot and I hope later on, after
he makes his fortune, he doesn't regret it.''

<HEAD>Radical Students Demonstrate Against Olympics; Roh Plans To Free
Dissidents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL SHIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 300 students protested today to
demand that the Olympics be shared with communist North Korea, and
they claimed the Games were being used to increase dictatorial rule.
   Officials said that President Roh Tae-woo plans to release
dissidents from prison after the Olympics.
   Students from several colleges in the Seoul area took part in
the rally at Hongik University and said they would ``not sit idle''
during the Olympics. But they did not say if they would attempt to
disrupt the Games.
   ``We oppose the Olympics, which only help dictator Roh
Tae-woo,'' the students shouted.
   Government officials are concerned radicals may stage protests
during the Sept. 17-Oct. 2 event. The radicals have little public
support and have been strongly criticized by many Koreans in recent
weeks for staging violent demonstrations.
   The one-hour rally and short march today were peaceful. Dozens
of students took up positions in front of the school for possible
clashes with police, but riot police stayed away.
   The students shouted slogans supporting North Korea's demand to
be a co-host at the Games.
   ``Let's advance national unification by co-hosting the
Olympics!'' the students chanted.
   North Korea has said it will boycott the Olympics unless it is
allowed to be a co-host. The International Olympic Committee said
the Games cannot be shared because they are awarded to a single
city.
   Radical students, a small but powerful minority on campuses, are
seeking to topple the Roh government. They have become increasingly
pro-leftist as they have lost support among most students and other
Koreans following broad democratic reforms by the government.
   South Korea and North Korea have been bitter rivals since the
peninsula was divided at the end of World War II. They fought the
Korean War of 1950-53 that left more than 1 million people dead.
   Government party officials said Roh made the agreement to free
political prisoners during political talks with party chairman Yoon
Gil-joong at the presidential residence. The officials, speaking on
condition of anonymity, did not specify how many prisoners would be
freed.
   In a series of recent meetings, Kim Dae-jung and three other
opposition leaders urged Roh to speed democratic reforms and
release all political prisoners.
   Hundreds of political prisoners have been freed since nationwide
protests in 1987 forced the government to accept opposition demands
for reforms.
   Opposition parties contend more than 500 dissidents still are
imprisoned or facing trial for anti-government activity or
political beliefs. The government claims fewer than 100 dissidents
remain in prison.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar was little changed today, trading
within a narrow range on European markets as dealers awaited the
announcement of U.S. employment data. Gold was lower.
   Foreign exchange dealers said in early trading the dollar
recovered slightly on support from the Japanese yen which had
broken through a critical resistance point of 137.00 yen.
   But the U.S. currency remained in a narrow range before U.S.
unemployment data was published. As the first economic indicator
for August, it could be a key factor in determining the dollar's
short-term trend, dealers said.
   The market on average expected the jobless rate to be unchanged
from July's 5.4 percent.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.05 yen to a closing 136.75 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 137.00 yen.
   Other dollar rates in Europe at midmorning, compared with late
Thursday's rates:
   _1.8745 West German marks, down from 1.8795
   _1.5815 Swiss francs, down from 1.5835
   _6.3750 French francs, down from 6.3780
   _2.1182 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1205
   _1,397.50 Italian lire, down from 1,398.50
   _1.2370 Canadian dollars, unchanged.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.6695 from $1.6730 late
Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $429.40 a troy ounce,
down 10 cents from late Thursday's bid. At mid-morning, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a lower recommended price of
$428.95.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $428.75, down from $430.50 bid late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 1.26 dollars to close at a bid
$431.35.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.56 a troy
ounce, down from Thursday's $6.58.

   Nearly 3,800 captives taken in fighting between
Somalia and Ethiopia have been flown home, most of them Ethiopian
POWs from a 1977-78 conflict, the International Committee of the
Red Cross said today.
   The prisoner swap supervised by the Geneva-based humanitarian
agency followed an agreement between Ethiopia and Somalia in April.
   A total of 3,543 Ethiopian prisoners of war and civilian
prisoners and one Cuban were brought back to Ethiopia in exchange
for the return of 245 Somalian POWs in a nine-day operation
completed Thursday, a Red Cross statement said.
   A Boeing 707 chartered by the Red Cross made 20 round-trip
flights between Somalia's capital of Mogadishu and Dire Dawa in
Ethiopia to complete the exchange, the statement said.
   The original plane crash-landed at Djibouti airport Aug. 26 when
its front landing gear failed, injuring 20 of the 190 people
aboard. The flights continued with another aircraft after a day's
interrruption.
   Forces from Somalia invaded the arid Ogaden region in 1977, but
Ethiopia's Soviet-backed communist government rebuffed the Somalis
the following year. The border conflict was not formally resolved
until the April peace agreement.

   Officials restored power to most of the
country early today after an explosion in a substation plunged
Athens and southern Greece in darkness for several hours.
   A police spokesman reported no blackout-related deaths, serious
injuries or looting but said hundreds of minor car accidents
occurred in Athens because there were no traffic lights.
   Fire officials said more than 1,000 Athenians were trapped in
elevators during the blackout, which lasted up to five hours in
parts of the city.
   A senior Public Power Corporation official said 90 percent of
power had been restored and the system would be back to normal by
the end of the day. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The blackout occurred Thursday night when an explosion in a
substation near the town of Larissa knocked out three of four power
cables serving southern Greece.
   Industry Minister Anastasis Peponis said power officials were
trying to determine the cause of the power failure, which he said
``probably wasn't caused by human error.''

<TEXT>
   A flash flood watch was in effect today for parts of Texas in
the wake of heavy rains that caused some street flooding, while
downpours in Minnesota increased pressure in storm sewers enough to
blow manhole covers off.
   Rainfall totaled more than 2 inches across parts of Texas,
leaving standing water in Lubbock and water-covered streets in Big
Spring and Odessa. In New Mexico, heavy rain caused streams to
overflow.
   Thunderstorms drenched Ely, Minn., with 3 inches of rain in two
hours, leaving basements flooded and streets under water. Though
manhole covers popped, the waters rapidly subsided after the storm
passed.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered along the Gulf Coast
and parts of Georgia, Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Oklahoma,
Kansas and Colorado.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, the Tennessee Valley, the lower
Mississippi Valley, Oklahoma, Texas and New Mexico. Similar storms
were expected from lower Michigan and Wisconsin into Kansas.
Showers should be scattered in northern Maine and norther parts of
the upper Great Lakes.
   High temperatures were forecast to be in the 70s in the upper
Mississippi Valley, parts of the northern Plains and upper Great
Lakes, northern Maine, the central and southern Rockies, and along
parts of the California coast; in the 90s in Louisiana, Florida,
parts of Texas, and the Pacific Northwest; and upwards of 100
degrees in the desert southwest and the inland valleys of
California and Oregon. The remainder of the nation should be in the
80s.
   The nation's temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 41 degrees
at Yellowstone, Wyo, to 90 at Yuma, Ariz.

<HEAD>President Offers Peace Plan With Guerrillas In National Address</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Virgilio Barco, in a national
address, offered to start peace talks with leftist guerrillas who
have attacked two northern Colombia towns within a week.
   Barco told a national television audience Thursday night that
the talks should conclude with the dissolution of guerrilla
organizations.
   Guerrillas must stop their terrorist acts, human rights
violations, kidnappings and extortions before talks begin, Barco
said. He said a peace agreement should be reached by March 1990,
when the next presidential and parliamentary elections are
scheduled.
   The offer came two days after guerrillas firing automatic
assault rifles, throwing hand grenades and setting fire to houses
killed 12 peasants, Gov. Jose Gabriel Amin of Cordoba state said.
   An estimated 30 guerrillas of the People's Liberation Army set
fire to a ranch, killed 10 peasants and wounded 15 Tuesday near the
town of Canalete, Amin said Thursday.
   Canalete is about 320 miles north of Bogota.
   The insurgents then attacked the nearby village of El Tomate,
setting fire to 26 huts and killing two people, the governor said
in a broadcast interview with the Colombian radio chain RCN.
   In El Tomate, a village of 600 people, the attackers left
messages painted on walls declaring, ``Death to the toads and
paramilitaries,'' survivors said in interviews with RCN.
   Guerrillas call army informants toads.
   Peasants in Colombia have long claimed that they are caught
between the army and the guerrillas.
   In dozens of interviews with The Associated Press, peasants have
told of being forced to sell food and other necessities to
guerrillas.
   Often soldiers force the peasants to give information about
guerrilla movements, the peasants say. The guerrillas then return
and kill the peasants, accusing them of being army informants, the
peasants have said.
   The People's Liberation Army and another guerrilla group known
as the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces attacked the town of
Saisa in the state of Cordoba on Aug. 23 and killed 12 civilians,
10 soldiers and two policemen, the Defense Ministry said.
   Twenty-two soldiers and policemen were taken prisoner, the
ministry said.

<HEAD>Hong Kong Planning New Shelter For Boat People</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said today it will build a new
emergency shelter for the growing number of Vietnamese refugees
arriving by boat to this British colony.
   The center, which is to open by the end of September, will be
the sixth center built to house Vietnamese boat people who landed
after mid-June. Hong Kong announced a new policy that classified
most of the boat people who arrived after June 15 as illegal
immigrants subject to repatriation.
   Vietnamese who arrived earlier are considered political refugees
eligible for resettlement.
   More than 9,000 new refugees _ including 2,375 in August _
arrived since the measure took effect, although it was designed to
stop the rising influx of boat people. The number of Vietnamese in
Hong Kong refugee camps totals 25,000, according to government
statistics.
   The new center is expected to shelter about 3,000 people in
huts, the government said.
   Some residents near the site of the future shelter said they
will oppose it unless authorities guarantee local services will not
be disrupted, government-run radio reported.
   Hanoi said it will examine on a case-by-case basis the
Vietnamese who arrived in Hong Kong after mid-June, if they
volunteer to return to their homeland, 500 miles southwest of Hong
Kong.
   However, only 1 percent of the boat people have requested
repatriation to their communist homeland, and none has returned so
far, a government spokeswoman said today.
   The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is processing
their applications to return.

   A report issued today by the
international writers' group PEN lists Associated Press
correspondent Terry Anderson among more than 300 writers it says
are imprisoned worldwide.
   PEN released its Writers in Prison report at its annual congress
which ended today in the South Korean capital. PEN is an an
international association of poets, playrights, editors, essayists
and novelists.
   Anderson, AP's chief Middle East correspondent, was kidnapped in
west Beirut on March 16, 1985, and is being held by pro-Iranian
extremists. He is one of 18 foreign hostages in Lebanon, nine of
them Americans.
   The report said 305 writers in 29 countries were imprisoned and
denied freedom of expression. The organization vowed to continue
efforts to fight censorship ``wherever it exists.''

   Fire gutted a mansion designed to
resemble the White House, causing about $4 million in damage to the
estate that was once a West Coast retreat for President Woodrow
Wilson, authorities said.
   The 75-year-old house, which overlooks a 4.6-acre estate, was
owned for more than 10 years by Dovie Beams de Villagran, the
self-described mistress of former Phillipine President Ferdinand
Marcos.
   The fire Thursday night destroyed the roof and top floor, said
Fire Department spokeswoman Diane Johnson.
   Construction work was being done at the time and no one was
living at the estate, she said. The cause of the blaze was under
investigation, Johnson said.
   The mansion, designed by architect Sumner Hunt and built in 1913
for Houston lumberman Henry House, was visited frequently by Wilson
following his election in 1912.
   The house was sold by Beams two years ago. Officials would not
identify the new owner.

<TEXT>
   An intellectuals' cruise ship trapped
in the ice inside the Arctic Circle awaited a Coast Guard
icebreaker today. The 149 passengers and crew members were in no
danger, the cruise operator said.
   Passengers on the Society Explorer bound for the Northwest
Passage were paying an average of $400 a day as clients of a
company specializing in educational journeys to unconventional
destinations, including Antarctica.
   The Coast Guard said the 236-foot ship was caught in Beaufort
Sea ice 50 miles northeast of Point Barrow, or about 400 miles
inside the Arctic Circle. The crew notified Canadian maritime
officials on Wednesday the ship was stranded.
   The Coast Guard said Thursday that one of its icebreakers, based
in Seattle, was bound for the area on a research mission and was
diverted to help the cruise vessel. The 399-foot icebreaker was
expected to reach the ship Saturday.
   The Society Explorer set sail from Dutch Harbor on Aug. 19.
Stops have included the Pribilof Islands, Gambell and the Siberian
port of Provideniya.
   The itinerary calls for the ship to sail east along the
Northwest Passage, with the voyage scheduled to end in St. John's,
Newfoundland, on Sept. 21.
   That schedule likely will be set back several days, said Peter
Cox, planning director for Society Expedition Cruises Ltd., which
offers trips that emphasize libraries and lectures.
   The passengers, most of them Americans, found intellectual
pursuits to fill the time while awaiting the Coast Guard.
   ``Our entertainment on board is mostly intellectual
entertainment, not gambling and dancing,'' Cox said. He said the
company caters to an ``extremely well-educated and a very
naturalist-oriented passenger.''
   He said the ship is ``absolutely safe'' and well-stocked with
items on its continental menu.
   Cox likened the Beaufort Sea to ``a big jigsaw puzzle'' of ice
and water.
   A wind rearranged the ice to the ship's disadvantage, said Randy
Crosby of North Slope Borough Search and Rescue. The rescue unit
planned to fly over the ship for a look but was held back by heavy
fog Thursday, Crosby said.
   Employees of an Alaskan air-service company who flew over the
vessel on Wednesday said it was caught in seven to eight miles of
ice.

   Police guarded a funeral
service in this village today for two IRA guerrillas killed by
British soldiers, and rioting occurred for a second night in
Catholic west Belfast.
   Black flags were hung on telephone poles and pro-IRA slogans
were scrawled on walls in Loughmacrory, 45 miles west of Belfast.
   Brothers Gerard Harte, 29, and Martin Harte, 21, were to be
buried after a service at St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church, and
26-year-old Brian Mullin's funeral was to be held Saturday at the
nearby village of Dunmoyle.
   Police said they were shot and killed in a British army ambush
Tuesday and that the trio was plotting to kill an off-duty soldier.
   Dozens of police with riot shields and batons deployed in the
village and along the road to the Harte family home, apparently to
prevent the IRA turning the funeral into an anti-British show of
strength.
   The IRA said it honored its dead comrades with a ceremonial
volley in the Loughmacrory area Thursday night.
   In Belfast, a police spokesman who demanded anonymity said
police fired plastic bullets to disperse rioters during violence in
Roman Catholic areas of the city that flared Thursday night and
continued early today.
   Police said that in rioting earlier Thursday in a west Belfast
IRA stronghold, three people were slightly injured and taken to the
hospital when troops fired plastic bullets at a hostile crowd.
   Police said the rioting in Belfast late Thursday and early today
was not on the scale of riots that broke out Wednesday.
   In those riots, gangs of young IRA supporters set fire to a bus,
two vans and more than 35 cars, and hurled gasoline bombs and rocks
at security forces while a gunman fired on the city's New Barnsley
police station.
   Dozens of burned out vehicles still blocked some roads in the
area Thursday night as groups of youths gathered at street corners,
talking and drinking beer while police and army patrols cruised by.
   Police said the three slain IRA men were armed, masked and
driving in a stolen car when they were ambushed. They said Gerard
Harte was the commander of the IRA's Mid-Tyrone unit and that
Martin Harte was responsible for selecting IRA targets from the
ranks of the police and the Ulster Defense Regiment.
   Martin Harte was arrested during police raids following the Aug.
20 bus bombing but was released without charge, they said.
   The IRA in a statement Wednesday said the Harte brothers and
Mullin, 26, were on ``active service'' _ a guerrilla euphemism for
a bombing or shooting mission _ when they were slain.
   The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and unite it with the mainly
Catholic Republic of Ireland under socialist rule.
   Organizers of Sport Aid, a worldwide charity run scheduled for
Sept. 11, announced that the army had withdrawn from participation
in an event at London's Hyde Park, citing the heightened IRA threat
to military personnel.

<HEAD>Stag Brewery Closes, Ending 130-Year Tradition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELLEVILLE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's last call for Stag Beer.
   Terry Galati pushed the last case of beer off the Stag Brewery
production line at 1 p.m. Thursday, ending a brewing era in
Illinois.
   ``As the final case came through, a lot of memories flashed in
my mind,'' said Galati, a machine operator at Stag for 11 years.
``I felt bad. It was a depressing moment for me.''
   Stag was Illinois' last full-scale brewery, and at 130 years was
one of the oldest in the Midwest. The closing put about 200 people
out of work.
   G. Heileman Brewing Co., which owns Stag, announced June 27 its
was closing the brewery because of its age, excess capacity at
other Heileman plants and the need to spend $2.9 million for a
sewage plant for the brewery.
   The LaCrosse, Wis.-based beer company and Belleville officials
continue to search for investors willing to reopen the brewery.
   Mayor Richard Brauer said last week an unidentified investor was
considering making an offer to buy the brewery.
   But Gary Perleberg, director of planning and development for
Heileman, said Thursday, ``We have received no offers and I have no
comment further than that.''
   Heileman bought the brewery from Carling National Breweries in
1979. Last fall, Australian brewing giant Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd.
purchased Heileman for $1.22 billion. The company closed a brewery
in Evansville, Ind., earlier this year.
   Workers who trickled out of the Stag plant Thursday said they
were resigned to the closing.
   ``It was very quiet at work today,'' said Galati, 34. ``There
was a lot of hugging and hand-shaking. ... I'm going to miss the
money and working with the guys. I've been working with some of
these guys for so long, I'll miss seeing them every day.''
   About 180 employees had been laid off by Thursday. The remaining
50 will be kept on indefinitely to handle distribution of the
remaining stock, close the books and maintain equipment in hopes an
investor will save the plant.
   Greg Beaston, 27, said his grandfather, father and four brothers
have worked at the brewery. He said he hopes the brewery is
reopened soon.
   ``The shorter the time it is shut down, the quicker it can be
started back up,'' Beaston said.

<TEXT>
   Feuding black political
organizations today signed an agreement aimed at ending the
country's bloodiest ongoing conflict, in which more than 600 people
have died in 20 months.
   The fighting in Natal Province has pitted supporters of militant
anti-apartheid organizations against members of Inkatha, a more
conservative group headed by prominent Zulu leader Mangosuthu
Buthelezi.
   Inkatha's secretary general, Oscar Dhlomo, and Jay Naidoo,
secretary general of the militant Congress of South African Trade
Unions, signed the agreement at a courthouse in the provincial
capital, Pietermaritzburg.
   The labor federation, known as COSATU, has been allied with the
United Democratic Front, a now-banned anti-apartheid coalition, in
the feud against Inkatha.
   The agreement condemns violence and calls for formation of a
conciliation board which would review residents' complaints of
harassment or attacks. The board's members would be selected
jointly by the two sides and have disciplinary powers.
   As part of the agreement, each side will drop pending court
cases accusing the other of violence.
   ``Each party recognizes the immediate necessity to make it
abundantly clear to its members that COASTU and Inkatha
categorically condemn acts of intimidation, forced recruitment and
violence,'' the agreement says.
   ``All political organizations have the right to exist and the
democratic right to espouse their own particular viewpoint,'' it
says.
   Most of the fighting has been in the black townships around
Pietermaritzburg but has spread in recent months to townships near
the larger port city of Durban. Many of the killings have been to
avenge earlier killings.
   Both Inkatha, which claims 1.5 million members, and the United
Democratic Front-COSATU alliance oppose the apartheid policies
which enable South Africa's 5 million whites to dominate 26 million
blacks. But their strategies differ markedly.
   The front, a predominantly black coalition of about 600 groups,
advocates economic sanctions, strikes and other confrontational
measures to bring about sweeping political and economic change.
Inkatha opposes sanctions, avoids militant protest and advocates
capitalism.
   Many militants view Buthelezi as a government collaborator
because he is chief minister of the KwaZulu homeland. However,
Buthelezi has rejected invitations by the government to join in
negotiating reforms that would expand blacks' political role while
leaving whites in ultimate control.
   Peter Kerschoff, a social worker in Pietermaritzburg who has
been involved in past reconciliation efforts, said the agreement
was an important but not final step toward ending the conflict.
   Because of government bans and restrictions ``it is extremely
difficult for COSATU and the UDF to communicate with grassroots
people. This will have to be addressed,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
   The Natal violence has distressed other anti-apartheid
campaigners and caused debate over whether black political groups
could avoid factional fights and effectively oppose the white-led
government.
   Some commentators viewed the conflict as a harbinger of
widespread black infighting that might develop as black groups with
different ideologies struggled for supremacy.

   A Titan rocket today propelled into
space a secret military payload that a civilian expert identified
as a satellite capable of eavesdropping on Soviet military and
diplomatic communications.
   The powerful, 16-story-tall Titan 34D, scoring its third
straight success after being grounded for 18 months, thundered from
its launch pad at 8:05 a.m.
   The Air Force did not announce the launch in advance, which has
been its practice on military space flights, and afterward said
only that the Titan 34D, ``carrying a classified military
payload,'' was successfully launched.
   John E. Pike, a space policy expert for the Washington-based
Federation of American Scientists, said last month the payload
would be a satellite to monitor Soviet missile tests and radio,
telephone, radar and other electronic military and diplomatic
communications.
   He said the payload carried an antenna built to unfold to the
size of a baseball field.
   Pike said the satellite project originally was code-named Chalet
but was changed to Vortex when Chalet became known. Vortex became
compromised some time ago and yet another name may have been
substituted, he said.
   The Titan 34D will remain the nation's most powerful unmanned
rocket until an upgraded version, the Titan 4, makes its launch
debut later this year, also with a military satellite. Both are
made by Martin Marietta in Denver.
   A Titan 34D carrying a reconnaissance satellite was launched in
October from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. Another blasted away
from Cape Canaveral a month later and placed in orbit a satellite
to provide warning of a missile attack.
   Before the October launch, the Titan 34D had been grounded
following two straight explosions of the rocket.

   Hundreds of thousands of anti-government
protesters marched today through major cities, and demonstrators
took over dozens of towns across the country, sources said.
   Students and Buddhist monks led the protesters in Moulmein, 50
miles east of the capital of Rangoon, a Western diplomat said. He
said some protesters occupied local government buildings.
   ``We estimate that up to 40 townships are under the control of
the people,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In Monywa, 400 miles northwest of Rangoon, an estimated 300,000
people, including striking government workers and policemen,
rallied for democracy and rejected the president's call to return
to work, a resident said.
   Thousands of people also rallied peacefully in Rangoon, but far
fewer were in the streets than the estimated 100,000 who rallied
the day before. The demonstrations today were concentrated near two
major rallying points, Rangoon General Hospital and the U.S.
Embassy.
   Demonstrators have demanded formation of an interim government
to lead the country back to democracy. President Maung Maung said
Thursday that this would be unconstitutional, but he said the
ruling party planned a Sept. 12 congress to consider a referendum
on ending 26 years of authoritarian single-party rule.
   A leading dissident, former Defense Minister Tin Oo, said today:
``It is no longer necessary to hold a referendum. The whole country
has rejected one-party rule. Only an interim government will be
able to ... ease the situation.''
   A lawyer speaking for the new League for Democracy and Peace,
headed by former President Win Maung, said:
   ``It is no time to talk about constitutionality at this stage.
The situation calls for an immediate change of government.''
   A statement from the Rangoon Lawyers' Council said the
government violated the Constitution by shooting demonstrators and
indefinitely detaining suspects.
   ``It is ridiculous to talk about constitutionality by the
government that has violated the Constitution on various
occasions,'' it said.
   In his speech, Maung Maung also said his government would
legalize student unions, banned since 1962, and rebuild the Rangoon
University Student Union Building, which the army destroyed in
suppressing dissent that year.
   But about 3,000 students rejected that and marched through the
streets of the capital. They and thousands of others, including
striking government workers, shouted: ``The students' cause and the
people's cause are indivisible.''
   A 17-year-old student leader called Maung Maung's speech, ``a
cunning trick to divide students from the people.''
   ``We are fighting not only for students' rights, but for the
entire people. We will continue to demonstrate until the one-party
regime is replaced by a democratic regime,'' he said.
   The diplomat said protesters have called for the biggest
demonstrations ever in Burma on Sept. 8.
   On Thursday night, the newly formed Committee for Democracy,
which is composed of 21 elder statesmen and former military
officiers, called a news conference to air demands for an interim
government. The diplomat said they called on protesters to vacate
government buildings to avoid confrontation.
   The government Wednesday warned it would take action against the
illegal occupiers, but the diplomat said there were no signs it was
carrying out the threat.
   Traffic has become considerably lighter in Rangoon with an
ongoing strike at the nation's oil refineries and a shortage of
gasoline.
   Rangoon's airport reopened today, and Union Burma Airways
resumed international flights. Striking employees closed the
airport Thursday, further isolating the Southeast Asian nation.
Burma's national airline halted domestic flights on Aug. 26.
   In Bangkok, Thailand, a Western diplomat said it is ``only a
matter of time'' before former leader Ne Win flees from Burma and
that the 77-year-old ex-general probably will go either to West
Germany or Switzerland.
   ``Ne Win's departure would lance the boil in Burma,'' the
diplomat said, also speaking anonymously.
   Ne Win led the 1962 military coup that ended democracy in Burma
and ushered in authoritarian rule. He resigned July 23, taking
indirect responsibility for bloody, student-led riots in March and
June, and he called for a referendum on single-party rule.
   But the ruling Burma Socialist Program Party rejected the
referendum and picked hardliner Sein Lwin to succeed him.
   Nationwide anti-government demonstrations followed and turned
bloody Aug. 8 when troops fired on crowds. By official count, at
least 112 people were killed in Rangoon alone before Sein Lwin
resigned Aug. 12.
   One week later, Maung Maung became Burma's first civilian leader
in 26 years, but pro-democracy demonstrations continued.

   Princess Beatrice, the newest member of
Britain's royal family, got a king-sized baby shower from this
community of the same name.
   The daughter of Andrew and Sarah, the Duke and Duchess of York,
received in absentia a regal array of gifts, from a college
scholarship to a library card and a key to the city of 13,000.
Beatrice, born Aug. 8, is fifth in line to the throne.
   The party, an open house Thursday at the Chamber of Commerce
office with cake, coffee and punch, was the idea of the Gage County
Visitors Committee, said chairman Randy Baynes.
   ``We wanted to celebrate something we had in common with her,
even though the name's pronounced differently,'' Baynes said.
   The cake, festooned with pink frosting roses, spelled out the
difference. It read: ``Be-AT-trice welcomes Princess BE-a-trice.''
   Her Royal Highness will receive a bevy of bibs, some
cross-stitched with her name, others crocheted.
   There were also baby booties, baby-sized high-topped tennis
shoes, a quilt, a rattle, an American flag, an atlas with the town
of Beatrice marked, a deck of cards, a toothbrush and a miniature
pink sand castle, labeled fit for a princess.
   ``I'm not sure the gifts are the traditional kind, but it's been
fun for the community,'' Bayne said.
   Some residents dropped off cards, including one from a young
girl who wished Beatrice the best of luck and added, ``I hope you
find a handsome prince to marry.''
   The princess has been made an honorary citizen of the community
and residents said they hope she'll make it there someday. If she
does, she will be able to check out a book from the the town
library with her own library card.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. Army private and her
9-year-old son are the only Americans identified among 49 people
killed in a fiery crash at an air show at a U.S. base, Air Force
officials said today.
   The officials also lowered their death toll from Sunday's
disaster. Earlier they said 52 people died when three Italian jet
fighters collided during the air show and one plowed into a crowd
at the Air Force base in Ramstein.
   West German officials said a badly burned male victim died
Thursday, raising the death toll to 49. U.S. and West German
officials now have the same death toll, said base spokeswoman
Monika Stuppy.
   ``There was so much confusion at the beginning. Now we are
meeting twice a day to coordinate more closely on this,'' Ms.
Stuppy told The Associated Press. The Air Force identified the two
dead Americans as Joshua Frymyer, 9, and his mother, Pfc. Genevieve
Riggs of the 110th Military Police Co. in Pirmasens, West Germany.
The child is survived by his father, Michael D. Frymyer, of
Lewistown, Penn., an Air Force statement said.
   No ages were available for the parents.
   Mrs. Riggs' husband, Army Sgt. Myron Riggs, 24, who was severely
burned in the disaster, served in the same military police unit as
his wife. He was flown Tuesday to Brooke Army Medical Center in
Texas, the unofficial U.S. military newspaper Stars and Stripes
reported.
   West German officials said 40 of the dead have been identified.
In addition to the two Americans, they are 33 West Germans, a Dutch
citizen, a French citizen, and the three Italian pilots, according
to Juergen Dietzen, spokesman for Rhineland-Palatinate state, where
Ramstein is located.
   Dietzen said 172 people remained in hospitals, including some
who had been released and returned after their condition worsened
at home.
   He said the hospitalized victims were 144 West Germans, 16
Americans, two Britons, and one each from France, Italy, Belgium,
Portugal, Africa and the Philippines. He did not name the African
country.
   Four more injured victims were not identified because they were
``unable to communicate due to the severity of their injuries,'' he
said.
   Meanwhile, a West German medical expert charged today that
rescue work after the air show disaster was seriously flawed and
that many burn victims were sent to hospitals incapable of handling
their injuries.
   ``The organizational handling of the catastrophe ... was a
scandal and an unbelievable failure of those responsible,'' said
Leo Koslowski, an expert on burns and former director of the
University Surgical Clinic in Tuebingen.
   Wolfgang Herbig, director of the nearby Kaiserslautern hospital,
where many of the injured were taken, said there were not enough
mobile medical teams available at the air base after the accident.
   But officials of Rhineland-Palatinate state strongly defended
the rescue efforts and praised the cooperation between Americans
and Germans.

   About 20 Iraqi Kurds occupied the London offices
of the United Nations today and accused Iraq of using chemical
weapons against their people, a U.N. official said.
   They demanded intervention by U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar.
   The United Nations has condemned Iraq for using chemical weapons
in its 8-year war with Iran.
   Iraq is fighting Kurdish separatists in northern Iraq who are
supported by Iran. Iraq launched an offensive to crush the Kurdish
rebellion soon after Iraq accepted a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire in
the Persian Gulf war.
   About 20 million Kurds live where the borders of Iran, Iraq and
Turkey converge. Turkish officials also have accused Iraq of using
chemical weapons against the Kurds.
   Eric Jensen, U.N. information director in London, said the group
gave him a petition for Perez de Cuellar and said they would not
leave until they got a satisfactory response to their demand.
   Perez de Cuellar left the U.N. office in Geneva on Thursday and
was traveling in Portugal today, Jensen said. The U.N. headquarters
in New York was closed when the Kurds moved into the London office
at 11 a.m. (6 a.m. EDT).
   ``Someone asked to come in. We are open to the public for many
purposes and the girl on the reception quite correctly let this
person in,'' said Jensen. ``Once the door was open a number of
others came in _ about 20.''
   A British group which supports Iraqi Kurds, the Commiteee
Against Suppression of Democratic Rights in Iraq, said the
occupying group represented seven Iraqi Kurdish parties.
   Questioned in a British Broadcasting Corp. interview on
Thursday, Iraqi Ambassador to London, Mohammed Sadiq Al-Mashat, did
not deny his country had used chemical weapons but said Iran had
``used chemical weapons first.''

   A spokesman for Kurdish rebels fighting
Iraqi government troops claimed today that the Iraqi army
slaughtered about 1,300 unarmed men, women and children this week.
   The official Islamic Republic News agency quoted Kurdish
refugees as saying their houses were set on fire and they fled into
the mountains without food.
   In London, a group of 20 Kurds occupied the offices of the
United Nations, accusing Iraq of using chemical weapons against
their people and demanding that U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar intervene.
   An official of the Kurdish Democratic Party told The Associated
Press in Nicosia in a telephone interview that the 1,300 victims
were arrested Aug. 28 in the Dahok region in northwestern Iraq,
killed and buried in mass graves.
   In addition, 43,000 people trying to get out of the region are
being held back by the Iraqi military, said the spokesman.
   There was no way to independently confirm the report.
   He said the refugees were ``suffering from hunger, disease and
serious chemical injuries.'' The spokesman, based in a West
European capital, declined to give his name for ``security
reasons.''
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, quoted a Kurd identified as
38-year-old Hakim Refaq as saying, ``My house has been set on fire
three times and for weeks we had to live in the mountains without
food or any other facilities.''
   It quoted other men as saying numerous villages had been
destroyed by the Iraqi army and that Kurdish families were being
imprisoned in camps.
   The ferocious battles between the Kurdish rebels and the Iraqi
army are escalating, the rebel spokesman said.
   ``Fierce fighting is now taking place around our main base,''
said the spokesman. The base, called The First Branch, is in
Amadiyah.
   He said the Iraqi northern-based 1st and 5th army corps as well
as the 7th army corps based in the south and the elite Presidential
guards were all fighting the Kurds. The rebels estimated Wednesday
that 60,000 troops backed by fighter-bombers and helicopter
gunships were fighting against them.
   In addition to burning villages, he said the Iraqi army used
chemical weapons to attack three villages in the Amadiyah area
Wednesday and Thursday.
   The spokesman said thousands of Kurdish refugees were trying to
flee to Turkey, with 90,000 already resettled there.
   ``We call upon the United Nations and the international
community to intervene and stop this war of genocide against our
people,'' he said.
   The Turkish and Iranian governments have reported that thousands
of Kurdish refugees have been streaming across their borders with
Iraq.
   In Turkey, Premier Turgut Ozal said Thursday that 60,000
refugees had arrived since the country opened its borders two weeks
ago.
   Iran supported the Kurdish guerrillas fighting for autonomy in
northern Iraq during the 8-year gulf war. Iraq launched an
offensive to crush the Kurdish rebellion after Iraq accepted a
U.N.-sponsored cease-fire Aug. 20.
   There are about 20 million Kurds living in the mountains where
the borders of Turkey, Iran and Iraq meet, and Syria and the Soviet
Union have small Kurdish enclaves.
   Iraq's 3.5 million Kurds have been fighting on and off for an
autonomous homeland for 50 years.

   A West German fighter jet
plunged into the North Sea today, leaving wreckage and empty life
rafts afloat at the scene, but no sign of the two-man crew, the
navy said.
   Navy aircraft, ships, and helicopters joined the search for the
pilot and weapons system officer of the Tornado jet, which crashed
about 10 miles miles north of the East Frisian island of Langeoog,
the navy said in a statement.
   Langeoog is six miles north of the West German coastline on the
North Sea.
   Rescue teams found two empty, inflatable life rafts and wreckage
but the crew was missing. The two men may be floating in the sea in
their life vests and the search was continuing, the statement said.
   Navy spokesmen said they did not know the cause of the crash,
which occurred during a routine training mission at about 9:00 a.m.
   The Tornado jet was assigned to Navy Flight Squadron One, which
is based near the northern West German town of Schleswig, 25 miles
north of Hamburg.

<HEAD>Expelled Author Invited to Join Memorial Committee for Stalin
Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who was expelled from the
Soviet Union after he chronicled the horrors of Josef Stalin's
rule, was asked to join an officially sanctioned committee building
a monument to Stalin's victims.
   An organizer said today the move did not necessarily indicate an
easing in official attitudes toward the dissident writer, whose
works angered the Kremlin, but reflected the number of Soviet
citizens who think Solzhenitsyn is one of the best qualified people
to serve on the committee.
   Solzhenitsyn, who won the 1970 Nobel Prize in literature, wrote
``The Gulag Archipelago,'' which traces the history of political
repression in the Soviet Union, especially the purges and
repression during Stalin's 29-year reign.
   Solzhenitsyn, who himself spent eight years in labor camps under
Stalin, was expelled from the Soviet Union in 1974 following the
publication of the ``Gulag'' trilogy in the West. He now lives in
Vermont.
   Under Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Stalin and his legacy
have received increasingly severe criticism. In July, the ruling
Communist Party Politburo approved the building of a monument in
Moscow to Stalin's victims.
   On Aug. 25, a public council to supervise the construction and
maintenance of the monument was formed, as well as an executive
committee to submit a blueprint for the memorial's design.
   Among those selected for the public council were Solzhenitsyn,
fellow dissident and Nobel Peace laureate Andrei D. Sakharov, poet
Yevgeny Yevtushenko and Boris Yeltsin, the fiery former Moscow
party boss.
   Yuri Samadunov, a member of the executive committee, said
members of the public council had been chosen in street polls
conducted at two central Moscow locations, as well as from names
submitted by readers to Literaturnaya Gazeta, Ogonyok and other
state-run publications.
   ``We chose the first 17 people mentioned, and Solzhenitsyn was
among them,'' Samadunov said in a telephone interview.
   This week's edition of Moscow News listed Solzhenitsyn as a
member of the public council charged with building the memorial.
   However, Samadunov said the committee had not yet been able to
notify Solzhenitsyn that he had been selected for the committee, or
to determine whether he would agree to take part in its work.
   ``We sent him a telegram with news of his selection and that of
the others, and asked his agreement, but the telegram was returned
to us with a notice that it could not be delivered because the
address was not precise enough,'' said Samadunov.
   Solzhenitsyn's wife has previously denied that the writer
intends to visit the Soviet Union.
   In June, the editor of the literary monthly Novy Mir said he was
negotiating for the right to print Solzhenitsyn's novel ``Cancer
Ward,'' which would mark the first publication of the author's work
in his native land since he was expelled in 1974.

<HEAD>Indictments Announced In $1.6 Billion Drug Ring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A billion-dollar drug ring gunned down
the mother of a potential witness, hatched terrorist-like plots to
free their jailed kingpin and laundered profits through phony coal
companies, prosecutors allege.
   U.S. Attorney Jim Wilson on Thursday announced the indictment of
25 alleged members of the ring on conspiracy, racketeering and
obstruction charges. Eighteen were in custody Thursday; the others
remained at large.
   The ring, described as one of the biggest in the Southeast,
smuggled 33 tons of cocaine worth $1.6 billion into the United
States over five years, Wilson said.
   Jerry Allen LeQuire, the alleged ringleader, has been in prison
since before his conviction in a 1983 smuggling operation involving
about 710 pounds of high-grade Colombian cocaine.
   Bill Warner, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent, said that
case launched the probe that resulted in the indictment unsealed
this week.
   Cocaine was brought from Colombia into small or remote airports
in Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee and hauled to Florida, Kentucky
and Tennessee for sale, authorities said.
   Wilson said the ring set up several phony coal companies in
Kentucky and one in North Carolina to launder its profits, which
helped finance a lavish life of yachts and Jaguars for some members.
   Members of the ring committed crimes ranging from the
machine-gun slaying of a witness' mother to witness tampering and
attempting to record grand jury proceedings, prosecutors said.
   In one of the alleged escape plots hatched to free LeQuire from
prison, LeQuire in 1985 came up with a scheme to blow up power
lines, airports, dams and Naval vessels to convince authorities
that terrorists were active in the United States, according to the
indictment, which gave no further explanation.
   The organization had profits totaling more than $280 million in
the year beginning July 1982 alone, and the same amount of cash was
buried in vaults on a farm in Greenback, Tenn., Wilson said.
   ``This is probably one of the biggest (importation operations)
in the Southeastern United States,'' said FBI agent Gerald Shockley.
   The indictment, unsealed Tuesday in Knoxville, Tenn., and
announced here Thursday, named LeQuire as the leader of a gang that
Wilson said smuggled 33 tons of cocaine, one ton of marijuana and
1,200 methaqualone tablets into the Southeast from 1981 to 1986.
   Ira DeMent, an attorney who along with defense lawyer F. Lee
Bailey is representing LeQuire, had no comment on the indictment.

<TEXT>
   Mothers Against Drunk Driving and other
organizations will focus attention this weekend on efforts to end
drunken driving with national advertisements, local events and a
request that motorists turn on their headlights, officials
announced today.
   Representatives of MADD, federal, state and local governments
and Volkswagen United States Inc. asked Americans to promise to not
drink and drive on Saturday and to show support for the ``Drive for
Life'' program by driving with their headlights on.
   ``We're asking all Americans to make this pledge with the hope
that they will continue their commitment never to drink and
drive,'' Norma Phillips, national president of MADD, told a news
conference.
   Last year, 23,632 Americans were killed and 560,000 were injured
in accidents attributed to drunken driving, according to MADD. On
last year's Drive for Life day, the traffic fatality rate dropped
28 percent, MADD says.
   ``We must constantly remind the American people of these
statistics, and do all we can to mobilize them to stop the
carnage,'' said Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley.
   Under a congressional resolution signed by President Reagan,
this weekend has been proclaimed National Drive for Life Weekend.
Over the long Labor Day weekend, the rate of fatal accidents caused
by drunken driving usually increases by 10 percent, MADD says.

<HEAD>Woman Who Posed As Sex Surrogate Says Therapist Asked Her To Play
Part</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who posed either as a sex
surrogate or someone bored with sex on three TV talk shows says a
sex therapist asked her to ``play the part,'' but the therapist
says he didn't intend to deceive anyone.
   Dean C. Dauw, a Chicago clinical psychologist, licensed sex
therapist and author, defended himself during an appearance via
satellite Thursday on ``The Sally Jessy Raphael Show,'' which is
taped here.
   ``I never intended to perpetrate a ruse. I never said `Go
pretend,''' Dauw said.
   Appearing in person was Tani Freiwald, 37, a former office
manager for Dauw who earlier this year posed as either a sex
surrogate or a woman bored with sex on talk shows hosted by
Raphael, Oprah Winfrey and Geraldo Rivera.
   Wes Bailey, 33, also of Chicago, who pretended on one show to be
a virgin and on another to be an impotent husband, also was
interviewed via satellite. He and Ms. Freiwald have worked together
in community theater.
   Raphael said she decided to do the program with the three, to be
broadcast Sept. 8, to give the public a chance to question people
who had ``blatantly lied.''
   Dauw said he had given Ms. Freiwald some training in sexual
surrogacy and ``I thought her to be functioning as a surrogate.''
   ``I assumed, perhaps falsely, she was working with my other
therapist,'' he said.
   Ms. Freiwald said she had done some research into sex surrogacy
but decided it was not for her, and she charged that Dauw has asked
her: ``Do you think you can play the part?''
   ``You asked me to dress provocatively for these parts. You asked
me to look like I was a sexy girl,'' she said.
   Dauw said he may also have falsely assumed that Bailey, a friend
of Ms. Freiwald's, was working with his other therapist. ``We were
acting in good faith,'' said Dauw. ``It is very easy to have
unclear communications or miscommunications.''
   Ms. Freiwald said she had decided to play the part of a sex
surrogate on Raphael's show because it was ``an improvisational
challenge I didn't think I could pass up'' and an opportunity to
see how one of her favorite talk shows is produced.
   Ms. Freiwald said the deception had an educational value in that
it showed ``you have to be a critical, analytical, participatory
watcher of television.''
   Bailey said he agreed to take part in the trickery because ``I
felt it was like going white-water rafting or climbing a mountain.''

   A burglar dubbed by authorities The Human Fly is
apparently scaling high-rise buildings and entering apartments
through open balcony doors, police said.
   The burglar has made nearly 50 nighttime hits in southeast
Denver during the last six months.
   ``He's got to be athletic _ either a mountain climber or someone
skilled,'' said Sgt. Bill Wiederspan. ``We think he's got to have
some climbing equipment.''
   Earlier this week, in one night, six apartments in a 10-story
building were burglarized, police said. The apartments were on the
third, sixth, eight, ninth and 10th floors and were entered through
balcony doors.
   Police said The Fly may want thrills as much as money. His
high-flying antics have cost his victims an average of only about
$50, and his takes have ranged from $20 to $500, police said.
   The Fly has left some clues _ an occasional shoe print on a
balcony railing or a screen door removed from its track.
   ``Originally, we hesitated to believe the victims,'' Wiederspan
said. ``We thought it might have been an internal theft. You get a
burglary on the eighth floor of a building you hesitate to believe
someone is capable of doing it.''
   But as more reports came in, police theorized he scales the
sides of buildings and may occasionally exit through a hallway
door, police said.

<TEXT>
   Iran's commander in chief today said
Iraq's claim to the disputed waterway at the southern end of their
border was an attempt to rekindle the war, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
   In a prayer sermon at Tehran University, Hashemi Rafsanjani
attacked Iraq's demand that the waterway _ known as the
Shatt-al-Arab in Iraq and as the Arvand River in Iran _ be dredged
and cleared of wreckage.
   Rafsanjani, also parliament speaker, said Iraq started the war
``with the prime goal of gaining control of the Arvand River and
was trying to rekindle it by repeating its aborted claim on the
waterway,'' the IRNA report said.
   Iran wants a 1975 treaty that split the waterway down the middle
to remain in effect, but Iraq claims the agreement is void.
   In Baghdad, the government-run daily Ath-Thawra said it expected
peace negotiations to ``be difficult, exactly like the difficulty
of war.''
   The newspaper said the Iranian government had nullified the
treaty by declaring in 1980 that all agreements signed by Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi were invalid. The shah was overthrown by an
Islamic revolution in 1979 .
   With regard to the negotiations, ``The most important thing is
to realize that this is our chance to get all our rights on land,
at sea and in the air,'' the newspaper said.
   In Tehran, Rafsanjani said soldiers at the front must remain
vigilant because there is a chance the war could start again.
``Even if the possibility of war becomes only 10 percent or 20
percent, we must remain attentive.''
   Rafsanjani's remarks also were broadcast by Tehran Radio. Both
reports were monitored in Nicosia.
   ``We want our armed forces to respect and obey the cease-fire,
but in case the enemy does not, they (Iran's forces) have a right
to respond,'' said Rafsanjani, echoing remarks he made in a
television interview Thursday.
   Both sides have made repeated belligerent statements over the
past few days as U.N.-sponsored peace talks in Geneva sputtered
over troop withdrawals and control of the waterway.
   The foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq have not met for a week,
although talks have continued at a lower level. Negotiations
started Aug. 25.
   In Geneva, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati charged
today that Iraq has violated the gulf war cease-fire more than 60
times since it took effect two weeks ago, and he said Iraq was
blocking progress in the peace talks by raising ``new
preconditions'' every day.
   U.N. observers have not reported any serious cease-fire
violations, only minor problems that they said were resolved.

   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati today
charged that Iraq has violated the cease-fire in the Persian Gulf
war more than 60 times since it took effect two weeks ago.
   Velayati also said Iraq was raising new conditions every day to
block progress in peace talks aimed at ending the eight-year
conflict.
   In Tehran, Iran's commander in chief accused Iraq of trying to
rekindle the war by claiming the disputed Shatt-al-Arab waterway,
the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported. The commander,
Hashemi Rafsanjani, made the remarks during a prayer sermon today
at Tehran University.
   Velayati spoke to reporters as he left the U.N. building after
meeting with Jan Eliasson, a Swedish diplomat who is the new U.N.
special representative for the talks. Shortly afterward, Iraqi
Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz also met Eliasson to brief him on
Iraq's position at the talks.
   Iraq is prepared to continue working ``sincerely and seriously''
toward full agreement on implementing the U.N. cease-fire
resolution that forms the basis of the negotiations, Aziz told
reporters.
   He did not comment on Velayati's allegations.
   Both sides have traded charges of cease-fire violations. But
U.N. observers monitoring the truce did not report any serious
violations by either side, only ``minor problems'' that were
resolved.
   ``After the establishment of the cease-fire, Iraq has had more
than 60 kinds of violations of the terms of the cease-fire,''
Velayati said. ``We have some difficulties because day-by-day they
raise some new preconditions.''
   The two 90-minute meetings were Eliasson's first talks with
Velayati and Aziz on substantial issues. Eliasson was formally
introduced to them by U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar after Eliasson's appointment Thursday.
   The two ministers have not met face-to-face since Aug. 26, when
the talks stalled. Negotiations have continued at a lower,
technical level since.
   Perez de Cuellar, who had mediated the talks since they began
Aug. 25, left Geneva on Thursday because of other commitments. He
said he was frustrated by the slow pace of the talks but that he
was trying to end the stalemate. He said he would return to Geneva
if necessary.
   The talks are stalled over follow-up procedures to the
cease-fire that went into effect Aug. 20.
   The major problem is the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, which forms the
southern border between the two nations and is Iraq's only outlet
to the sea.
   Iraq wants full control of the waterway and has repudiated a
1975 treaty that gave Iran control of half of the Shatt-al-Arab.
Iran says any peace settlement must include strict adherence to
that treaty.
   A U.N. compromise would guarantee free navigation for both
nations in the Persian Gulf, withdrawal to internationally
recognized borders and an impartial study of conflicting positions
on the Shatt-al-Arab.
   The cease-fire resolution also calls for prisoner exchange and
the work of a commission to determine which side started the war.
   On Thursday, Iran accused Iraq of taking more than 750 Iranian
troops prisoner in attacks since the cease-fire began. The Iraqi
government said Iran continued setting up observation posts and
bunkers, moving troops close to the border and launching gunboats
into the Shatt-al-Arab.
   A U.N. report Thursday said Iran brainwashed Iraqi prisoners of
war, turning many into fanatical supporters of Iran. The report
also said many POWs from both nations are afraid to return home.
   The report was compiled by Maj. Gen. Rene Bats of the Belgian
army and international law professors Wolfram Karl of the
University of Salzburg, Austria, and Torkel Opsahl of the
University of Oslo, Norway.
   POW camps in Iran were dominated by Iraqi prisoners who swore
allegiance to Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and denounced
Iraq's President Saddam Hussein as an atheist, the report said.
   ``Cultural Committees'' in the camps provided religious and
political instruction called ``spiritual guidance,'' it said. ``To
us, it is indistinguishable from mental pressure.''
   In Iraq, the report found no mental indoctrination of Iranian
POWs but said the prisoners also were worried about going home.
   The U.N. investigators estimated that Iran may be holding up to
70,000 POWs, and Iraq may have about 35,000 prisoners.

   A weather system in the Gulf of Mexico strengthened
today into tropical storm Debby and was expected to bring up to 10
inches of rain to parts of Mexico.
   The Mexican government posted storm warnings from Santa Cruz to
Vera Cruz for Debby, which had maximum sustained wind of 40 mph,
with gusts up to 50 mph, said National Hurricane Center forecaster
Hal Gerrish.
   At 8 a.m. EDT, Debby was 180 miles southeast of Tampico, Mexico,
moving west at 8 mph.
   ``Locally heavy rains up to 10 inches can be expected over
portions of Mexico,'' Gerrish said. ``Some flash floods and mud
slides may occur in the warned area and inland today and tonight.''
   The storm, designated a tropical storm and named Debby when its
sustained wind passed the minimum 39 mph, was expected to weaken
and die out soon after hitting the coast.
   Debby is the fourth named storm of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane
season. None have reached the 74 mph wind speed at which a storm is
classified as a hurricane.

   An ``extremely cautious'' Delta Air
Lines pilot aborted takeoff when a panel indicator warned of
possible engine trouble on Flight 1141, on which a jet crashed and
burned a day earlier.
   Six people aboard aborted Flight 1141 Thursday were among the 95
survivors of Wednesday's crash at Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport, which killed 13. The doomed plane also was a Boeing 727.
   ``He was only at a maximum of 20 knots (23 mph) ... which is
pretty slow for an airplane,'' said Glenda Johnson, a Delta
spokeswoman in Atlanta. ``Then he gets an indicator on the panel
that there is a momentary disruption of air flow'' in one of the
engines.
   ``The captain feels that he had what is called a compressor
stall,'' said another Delta spokesman, Bill Berry. ``There was a
crosswind blowing across the runway. That can interrupt the
smoothness of the airflow that goes into the engine, creating a
temporary loss of power.''
   Under normal circumstances, a pilot would ``simply increase
thrust to see if everything continued to perform right. But based
on the incident that happened yesterday, the captain was extremely
cautious and elected simply to come back to the gate and let
maintenance look at the engine,'' Berry said.
   On any day, Berry said, captains ``have got to go by their years
of experience'' and can abort flights ``if they don't like what
they feel, if they've just got a gut feeling.''
   Delta declined to release the pilot's name.
   Today, Delta Flight 1141 departed Dallas-Fort Worth without
incident. The flight was airborne at 8:49 a.m., a few minutes
behind schedule.
   Delta officials at the terminal declined to talk to reporters,
but several passengers who regularly take Flight 1141 said the
plane carried only about half as many passengers as usual.
   Wednesday's Flight 1141, bound for Salt Lake City, crashed and
burned shortly after takeoff. Federal investigators said the
aircraft may have experienced an engine malfunction as it left the
runway.
   Delta officials said no maintenance problems were found in the
engine of the jetliner whose takeoff was aborted. Although
officials said there never was any danger, many passengers appeared
jolted after the plane returned to the gate.
   ``We figured this would be the safest flight we could ever take
today,'' said Louise Cox of Baton Rouge, La., as she waited to
board another 727 for Salt Lake City. ``Evidently not.''
   ``It was a routine takeoff until we got almost to the end of the
runway,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Don Burkhalter of Jackson,
Miss., where the flight originated. ``Then we heard what sounded
like bumps and the pilot decelerated. He said there was a problem
with the `compressors,''' Burkhalter said.
   ``The captain said, and this is a quote, `It's just one of those
things.' We just laughed.''
   It was a nervous laughter, said Burkhalter, who was on his way
to Fresno, Calif., with his wife.
   Thursday's flight carried 102 passengers and a crew of seven,
said Delta spokesman Henry Conley in Dallas. Conley said that to
his knowledge, all the passengers got on a substitute plane.
   A survivor from Wednesday's crash said he had trouble working up
the courage to board Flight 1141 _ the flight that was aborted _ a
day after the accident.
   ``You've got to do it sometime,'' said Ronald Black, 30, of West
Monroe, La. ``Can't live in Dallas.''
   Burkhalter said two of the crash survivors aboard Thursday's
flight whom he talked to appeared relatively calm, although one
said ``he was a little nervous.''
   Passenger George Snelling, 30, of Dallas, said he missed
Wednesday's Flight 1141 because of a faulty alarm clock.
   Waiting to board the same flight Thursday, Snelling said, ``I'm
a little apprehensive, but when the time's up it's up and I would
have been on the plane yesterday.''

<TEXT>
   WINDHOEK, South-West Africa (AP) _ The South-West Africa
People's Organization today denied it planted a bomb at a hotel
patronized by blacks and blamed South Africa. The blast killed two
people and injured 15, police said.
   The three-story Continental Hotel was severely damaged by the
explosion Thursday evening. Witnesses said parked cars were hurled
across the street.
   About one mile away, a mine exploded 90 minutes later on a
railroad line, but no one was injured, police said. Hospital
officials earlier had said two people were hurt in the blast.
   The South-West Africa People's Organization, or SWAPO, has
fought since 1966 for independence for the South Africa-ruled
territory.
   It issued the denial from its office in Lusaka, Zambia, and
called the bombing one of ``South Africa's dirty tricks.'' The
statement said: ``It is not SWAPO's policy to attack soft targets.
This bomb attack was aimed at demoralizing white Namibians and
setting them against SWAPO.''
   The explosions occurred on the day SWAPO said it would begin a
voluntary cease-fire. The organization has fought a long guerrilla
war against South African control of South-West Africa, also known
as Namibia.
   The government-run broadcasting network said an anonymous
telephone caller claimed responsibility on behalf of the
guerrillas, and South Africa's chief representative in the
territory, Louis Pienaar, blamed the bombing on SWAPO.
   The guerrilla group normally attacks military targets or white
residential or shopping areas, but the hotel was patronized by
blacks. Pienaar did not explain why the guerrillas would bomb a
hotel patronized by blacks.
   Firefighters needed more than 90 minutes to bring the blaze
under control.
   SWAPO and other black groups have warned of a possible white
backlash in South-West Africa because of preliminary South African
proposals for independence elections that probably would result in
government by the black majority.
   SWAPO said its guerrillas would stop launching attacks in the
territory Thursday to contribute to a regional peace initiative
involving South Africa, Cuba, and Angola.
   South Africa has administered South-West Africa for 73 years,
despite repeated U.N. resolutions since 1966 calling for
independence in the territory.
   South Africa says it will begin withdrawing from South-West
Africa on Nov. 1 and allow independence elections June 1, 1989, if
Cuba pulls its 50,000 troops out of Angola by June 1.
   On Tuesday, South Africa said it has pulled all its troops out
of Angola, where it was fighting alongside rebels in their battle
against Angola's Marxist government and its Cuban allies.

   Investigators are pointing to possible
problems with Delta Flight 1141's engine thrust and wing flaps
before it crashed on takeoff, and hope to get answers from the crew
and the cockpit recordings.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators said Thursday
a flap indicator handle in the wrecked cockpit was found in the
wrong position for most takeoffs, raising questions whether the
plane's wing flaps were set properly.
   Incorrectly set flaps led to the fatal crash of a Northwest
Airlines flight last summer. The Delta Air Lines flight's indicator
handle, however, could have been accidently jarred during or after
the crash, investigators said.
   The Boeing 727 got no more than 30 feet off the runway at
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport before it crashed
Wednesday, witnesses told the NTSB. Thirteen people were killed.
   Pilots in planes waiting on adjacent taxiways told investigators
``a white flame or vapor'' came from the left engine, said NTSB
member Lee Dickinson.
   A cockpit tape recording recovered from the burned wreckage
revealed that the pilots talked about engine trouble seconds before
the crash, he said.
   Further review of the tape and the flight data recorder were
planned today at the NTSB's Washington laboratory.
   The jetliner crashed as it tried to take off for Salt Lake City
with 108 people aboard. Ninety-five people survived the crash, most
by escaping through emergency exits or torn-open areas of the
fuselage. Thirty-three remained hospitalized Thursday.
   Medical examiners said the 13 died from smoke inhalation. Many
were trapped when an emergency door wouldn't open.
   The plane's flight engineer, Steven M. Judd, told investigators
that right after the plane took off the crew ``began experiencing
problems keeping the plane stable and in the air,'' The New York
Times reported today.
   ``Just before the crash, there was some talk of engine
problems,'' Judd added, according to the Times, which attributed
Judd's statement Wednesday to an anonymous source.
   Judd and the two other members of the cockpit crew remained
hospitalized today. Investigators said they had not recovered
sufficiently to undergo full-scale debriefings, but that they hoped
to interview First Officer Wilson Kirkland today.
   Control tower personnel said the jet may have taken longer than
usual to become airborne and that it may have lifted off at a
sharper angle than is considered normal, the investigators said.
   ``Obviously, one of the questions that we will be trying to get
an answer to is why the airplne did not lift off the runway until
about 8,500 to 9,000 feet down the runway. ... It was too long a
distance for a runway takeoff,'' said Dickinson, noting the plane
should have begun to take off between 5,500 feet and 6,000 feet.
   Dickinson said investigators also received maintenance records
on the plane Thursday.
   The flap handle, on the console between the pilot and the first
officer, indicates whether the flaps are in the proper position to
provide the lift needed for takeoff. Dickinson said the handle was
found in the up position, opposite where it should be for most
takeoffs.
   But he said the handle could have been pushed into the wrong
position by the impact or during the evacuation of the crew.
   ``It could have been kicked. It could have been moved. It could
have been any number of things,'' Dickinson said.
   Flight crews of nearby planes told investigators they had ``no
clear indication of the flap or slat positions,'' he said.
   Federal investigators determined that the flaps and slats of a
Northwest Airlines MD-80 were not properly set for takeoff when
that plane crashed Aug. 16, 1987, at Detroit Metropolitan airport,
killing 156 people.
   Earlier, Dickinson told reporters the crew was warned of trouble
by the ``stick shaker,'' which rattles the jet's steering mechanism
when a problem develops.
   ``This indicates the plane may be approaching a point where it
won't be able to fly,'' he said. ``Shortly after that, there was
some conversation about an engine problem.''
   But he stressed that the warning could have stemmed from
something besides an engine problem.
   Dickinson said none of the jet's three rear-mounted engines
showed signs of external damage, including the right one, which
wound up separated from the fuselage.
   ``It is possible for an engine ... to belch out the rear
something that would look to people like fire and smoke and yet to
have no visible damage,'' said Bernard Loeb, deputy director of the
NTSB's bureau of accident investigation.
   All three of the JT-8D engines eventually will be removed and
examined by their manufacturer, Pratt & Whitney of Hartford, Conn.
   The same flight Thursday from Dallas-Fort Worth to Salt Lake
City was aborted when the pilot detected a problem with his plane,
another Boeing 727. Most of the 102 passengers, including six
survivors of the crash Wednesday, left about two hours later on
another jet, Delta said.

   Michael Dukakis today will bring back to his
campaign John Sasso, its former manager, who resigned last year
after leaking a videotape that helped drive Delaware Sen. Joseph
Biden from the Democratic presidential race.
   Sasso, Dukakis' closest political confidant since 1982, will
rejoin the campaign as vice chairman, according to campaign sources
who spoke on the condition they not be named.
   Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee, will make the
announcement at news conference today in California, where his is
campaigning, the sources said.
   Sasso will appear at a separate news conference at noon in
Boston, along with his replacement as campaign manager, Susan
Estrich, and campaign chairman Paul Brountas.
   The move to rehire Sasso comes at a time when Dukakis has been
criticied for allowing his once double-digit lead in the polls to
disappear in the wake of aggressive attacks from Republican nominee
George Bush.
   Only in recent days has Dukakis begun to fire back, and sources
said Sasso was among those urging Dukakis to take a more aggressive
stance. ``He's the man the governor believes in most, will listen
to the most,'' said one of the sources.
   Sasso, who directed Dukakis' comeback as governor in 1982 and
then served as his Statehouse chief of staff, will take a leave
from his job at Hill & Holladay, an advertising firm he joined last
year after resigning the campaign job.
   Dukakis has stayed in close contact with Sasso since then mainly
by telephone, reluctant to appear together with his former top
aide. The vice chairman's job will be a paid campaign position, the
sources said.
   Sasso resigned from the campaign after telling Dukakis he was
responsible for leaking videotapes to the press showing that Biden
used words during a debate in Iowa taken almost verbatim from a
campaign speech by British Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock.
   Biden dropped out of the campaign after this and other instances
of alleged plagiarism were publicized. Another Dukakis campaign
aide, Paul Tully, also resigned because of his role in the incident.
   Dukakis, at first reluctant to accept Sasso's resignation, said
later that Sasso had used ``very poor judgment.''
   Dukakis also said Sasso ``will have no role in this campaign,''
but he refused to rule out a possible role for Sasso in a Dukakis
administration should he win in November.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Finish Brazil's New Constitution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislators today completed a l9-month
process of drafting a new constitution to replace an authoritarian
document handed down two decades ago by the military regime.
   The document shortens presidential terms to five years,
abolishes cencorship, guarantees the right of workers to strike and
rejects land reform.
   Elated lawmakers in the constituent assembly sang the national
anthem and threw confetti into the air when speaker Ulysses
Guimaraes closed the final sesion at 1:49 a.m.
   ``Brazil is a new country,'' Guimaraes said. ``This constitution
will protect the weak and punish those who abuse power.''
   The final version appeared to be a mixture of radical, even
nationalistic laws on foreign and domestic business and mainly
conservative laws on issues such as land reform.
   Since February 1987, legislators have been working on the new
charter, which replaces the 19-year-old constitution handed down by
military generals during a 1964-1985 military regime.
   The new 245-article charter is to go into effect Sept. 23. It
will be Brazil's eighth constitution in 166 years of independence.
   The 559 representatives and senators chosen in wide-ranging 1986
elections have been voting for several weeks on the more than 1,000
amendments to the 245-article final draft, which was completed in
July.
   The draft itself was the result of more than a year of voting on
an initial draft of more than 3,000 articles, derided by many
because of its length.
   Over the past 19 months, legislators engaged in heated and often
even violent debate over such controversial issues as land reform,
the system of government Brazil should adopt, the presidential term
and the right to strike.
   Some of the key decisions are:
   _President Jose Sarney and future presidents will serve for five
years, in contrast to the six-year term of former military
presidents.
   _Censorship, a remnant of military days, was abolished in films,
books and television.
   _The right to strike was guaranteed for all workers. Before,
``essential'' sectors of the labor force were not allowed to strike.
   _The assembly rejected wide-ranging land reform in a country
where four percent of the people own 50 percent of the farmable
land. This countered a government promise to distribute land to 1.4
million landless peasant farmers.
   _Decree law, a powerful tool used by the president to bypass
Congress and push through legislation, was also abolished.
   _The voting age was lowered from 18 to 16 years of age. The only
other country where 16 year olds can vote is Nicaragua.
   _Maternity leave for new mothers was extended from 90 to 120
days and the work week was cut from 48 to 44 hours.
   _A 12 percent ceiling was imposed on interest rates charged
above inflation. Interest rates have been running as high 1,000
percent yearly, while inflation this year is expected to reach 700
percent.
   _Mineral mining was nationalized and foreign companies now
involved in mining will have to leave Brazil in four years or
transfer financial control to residents of the country.
   _New oil risk contracts allowing foreign companies to drill in
oil-rich Brazil were banned.

   Residents of a tourist town outside Yellowstone National Park
left overnight as a ``slop-over'' wildfire moved to within 1{
miles. Elsewhere in the West, campers were barred from the woods as
the Labor Day weekend opened.
   Wildfires also burned over hundreds of thousands of acres in
California, Idaho, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.
   In West Yellowstone, Mont., residents and tourists filled their
gas tanks as flames to the west lit up the sky with an orange glow
Thursday night.
   ``There are some pretty nervous people, no question about
that,'' said Dawn Whitman, a gas station owner.
   The threat came from a quarter- to half-acre ``slop-over'' of a
109,100-acre fire inside the park. As the flames progressed,
residents watched smoke billow high into the air. Explosions set
off by firefighters cutting fire lines periodically shook buildings.
   ``The town was pretty excited last night,'' Brian Morris, a
Forest Service spokesman in West Yellowstone, said this morning.
   ``Things have calmed down a little. No evacuation has been
ordered, but we do have an evacuation plan in case one is
necessary.''
   Earlier Thursday, Yellowstone's south gate reopened for the
first time in almost two weeks, leaving all park entrances and
roads open.
   In eastern Oregon, recreational users were banned from 3.8
million acres of state-protected land beginning today. Already
closed are 2.8 million acres in western Oregon.
   In Idaho, lighter wind allowed firefighters breathing room on
the worst of 17 blazes, but activities were restricted in several
forests over the Labor Day weekend. Tight controls also were placed
on campfires in Washington state.
   ``It's like sitting on a time bomb,'' said Scott Phillips,
recreation officer for the Sawtooth National Recreation Area in
central Idaho. ``If we can get through this weekend without a
conflagration, it will be a miracle.''
   Progress was reported on two other major series of fires in
northeast Washington, but the forecast was for hot and dry weather
over the weekend, and U.S. Forest Service spokesman Paul Hart said,
``All these fires are real worries because any one of them can blow
up.''
   Crews battling five forest fires in California's mountain ranges
hoped to contain the blazes by today, but forest fire danger will
remain high throughout the holiday weekend, they predicted.
   Despite tinder-dry conditions, this year's fires have been much
smaller than last year's because there haven't been strong winds.
   Harley Greiman of the U.S. Forest Service warned, however, that
more lightning and temperatures in the 90s in the mountains are
expected during the Labor Day weekend, adding to the danger.
   In the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness along the Montana-Wyoming
border, crews had to be pulled back from a fire line Thursday along
a flank of a 47,200-acre fire when the blaze flared up and
destroyed portions of the line.
   ``The fire got rolling in there and it got too hot,'' said fire
information officer Chris Comstock. ``This is the fourth day we've
built good line and had to back up and let it go.''
   In Utah, strong ridgetop winds near the Pineview Reservoir
fanned a once-controlled fire into a 2,000-acre inferno threatening
high-voltage lines that bring power to the Salt Lake-Ogden-Provo
metropolitan area.

<HEAD>Israeli Analysts Say Soviets Expanded Tartus-Arwad Base</HEAD>

   The Soviets are expanding naval facilities in
the Syrian port of Tartus and the neighboring island of Arwad to
counter the U.S. presence in the Mediterranean, Israeli analysts
said today.
   The Soviet Union's installations in Tartus include submarine and
surface ship maintenance facilities and constitute the largest
Soviet naval base in the Mediterranean, said Dore Gold of Tel Aviv
University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies.
   According to Aharon Levran, editor of The Middle East Military
Balance published this week by the center, the facilities extend to
Arwad island and include recreation facilities for Soviet crews.
   Gold said there was no declassified information available on the
current or planned size of the Soviet base but said the general
trend has been one of expansion at least since 1987.
   In addition, the Soviets use land installations in Syria for
naval and air intelligence-gathering, the two analysts said in
separate interviews with The Associated Press.
   Gold said that the main objective of the Tartus base expansion
was to counter the presence of the U.S. 6th Fleet in the
Mediterranean.
   The Soviets had to find new arrangements in the region after
Albania shifted its alliance to China in 1961 and Egypt abrogated
its friendship treaty with Moscow in 1976, he said.
   He said the Tartus facility was important for prolonged
deployment of Soviet attack submarines in the Mediterranean.
   In an article published today in the English-language daily
Jerusalem Post, Gold noted that the London-based Jane's Defense
Weekly in May referred to Tartus as ``the primary maintenance
facility for Soviet submarines operating in the Mediterranean.''
   Levran said the Soviets have been using Tartus for at least five
years and that the base's expansion apparently was a price Syria
had to pay for purchasing Soviet weapons.
   In spite of the Kremlin's recent reluctance to supply Syria with
advanced weapons systems, he said, ``Syria is still the Soviet
Union's strategic asset in the Middle East.''
   He said the base replaced the Soviet practice of using
Mediterranean Squadron's mother-ships for maintenance. But he said
the base was less important than the recently developed Soviet Far
Eastern base in Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam.
   Syria's navy, Levran wrote in the 1987-88 Middle East Military
Balance, ``underwent a radical facelift'' due to supplies, training
and maintenance cooperation from the Soviet Union.
   The Soviet base in Tartus could ``create a problem'' for Israel
in wartime because Israel may be reluctant to harm a Soviet-flagged
facility, he said.

<HEAD>Death Of High School Cheerleader Sparks Controversy Over
Replacement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A teen-ager who was named a high school
cheerleader after a member of the squad died in an auto accident
was dropped from the squad at the request of the dead girl's mother.
   The decision to remove Nikki Cheek, 14, from the junior varsity
cheerleader squad has sparked controversy at Magoffin County High
School.
   Christy Michelle Caudill, 14, a popular cheerleader, was killed
in a car-truck collision May 27 along with her 16-year-old brother
and another girl. Nikki was named to replace Christy, but on July
8, county Schools Superintendent Carter Whitaker removed her from
the squad at the request of Christy's mother, Carrie M. Caudill.
   Mrs. Caudill said Whitaker acted out of compassion for a mother
whose only children had died. Christy's spot on the squad, she
said, should be left vacant in her memory.
   ``It was a bad situation, a no-win situation,'' Whitaker said
today. ``It's hurting both families.''
   ``I know it really put him on a spot,'' said Mrs. Caudill. ``God
knows, I don't want to hurt another kid, but I just think as hard
as my daughter worked at it, and she's gone; in memory of her, they
ought to hold it open.''
   But Nikki's mother and father, Patty and Jim Cheek, criticized
the action. In a letter to the Salyersville Independent, they
expressed ``deepest sympathy'' for Mrs. Caudill but said she and
Whitaker had decided ``to hurt another innocent child.''
   Nikki received threatening phone calls after being named to
replace Christy ``saying she shouldn't be taking the place of a
girl that was killed in the accident,'' the letter said.
   The letter also said Nikki attended six or seven practices
before she was removed.
   Mrs. Caudill said she discussed the situation with Mrs. Cheek
several weeks after Nikki was named a cheerleader.
   ``I told Mrs. Cheek that Nikki had other years she could be
cheerleader,'' Mrs. Caudill said. ``Christy could not try out
again.''

<HEAD>Cadet, Injured In Accident, Faces Possible Dismissal From Academy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AIR FORCE ACADEMY, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Air Force cadet who lost part
of a leg in an auto accident faces dismissal from the academy
because of a rule prohibiting amputees in the service, officials
said.
   Cadet Second Class Dan Korslund, 20, of Tacoma, Wash., has asked
that he be allowed to continue his studies and graduate with the
Class of 1991 with a bachelor of science degree even though he
can't receive an Air Force commission.
   A medical review board is studying the case, and an official
recommendation has not yet been made to Air Force Secretary Edward
Aldridge, said academy spokesman Will Ketterson.
   But Air Force regulations prohibit anyone ``who has lost a limb,
including a foot, leg or thigh,'' from military service, and
therefore from academy enrollment, Ketterson said.
   ``It is very unlikely Cadet Korslund will return to the Air
Force Academy,'' Ketterson said.
   Korslund was injured in an accident June 21, and his right leg
was amputated 8 inches below the knee. He was a promising defensive
tackle on the academy's football team.
   His possible dismissal drew criticism from a handicapped rights
group, which staged a protest Thursday outside the academy's chapel.
   Members of American Disabled for Accessible Public, many in
wheelchairs, handed out leaflets protesting ``the hypocrisy of the
U.S. government and the Air Force.''
   They cited the 1973 Rehabilitation Act that prohibits any
discrimination against the disabled by any agency receiving federal
funds. They carried signs reading: ``USAF Academy Discriminates,''
``Disabled and Ready to Serve'' and ``Be All You Can _ Except
Disabled.''
   Sen. William L. Armstrong, R-Colo., also has asked the Air Force
to let Korslund stay.
   Korslund is a patient at University Hospital in Denver and is
expected to be transferred to a Veterans Administration hospital.

   Two gunmen took four people hostage
inside a bank this morning, police said.
   ``Apparently they've broken a window in the back part of the
bank this morning and were waiting inside for the employees to come
in,'' said Officer Douglas Anderson.
   Police surrounded the single-story granite building, and SWAT
team members were posted to either side of the front door of the
downtown Third National Bank branch after the hostages were taken
about 8 a.m., police said.
   Sgt. W.O. Smith said police negotiated with the gunmen by
bullhorn at the back of the building. Police had been unable to
reach the hostage takers by telephone.
   It was not known if the hostages, thought to be three women and
a man, had been injured, Anderson said.
   The curtains in the building were closed.
   ``What it boils down to is a give and take, just like any type
of negotation situation,'' said Anderson. ``You give up something
to get something.''

<HEAD>Iranian Minister Promises Help in Freeing Hostages; Waite Reported
Ill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati today
said Iran will do its best to help win the release of the British
hostages in Lebanon.
   Velayati also told the British Broadcasting Corp. radio he had
asked ``friendly groups'' in Lebanon to help free the British
hostages and received an affirmative reply. He spoke to the BBC in
Geneva, where he is participating in peace talks in the Iran-Iraq
war.
   In Beirut, the weekly magazine Ash-Shiraa reported that Anglican
Church envoy Terry Waite, one of the British hostages, is suffering
from a severe stomach ailment. It said that could speed his release.
   The weekly quoted unidentified ``highly informed sources'' as
saying Waite's health had ``sharply deteriorated recently, which
forced his kidnappers to call in a stomach specialist to treat
him.''
   ``The same sources said the sudden deterioration of Waite's
health could result in speeding up his release,'' Ash-Shiraa said.
   The magazine gained fame when it broke the story of the secret
U.S. arms sales to Iran. But since then, its report about hostages
held by pro-Iranian extremists in Lebanon have not all been
accurate.
   There was no way to verify the report on Waite.
   Many of the 18 foreigners missing in Beirut are believed to be
held by pro-Iranian extremist groups.
   In addition to Waite, the British hostages are teacher Brian
Keenan, 36, who also holds Irish citizenship, and journalist John
McCarthy, 31.
   The British Foreign Office says it also seeks word on Alec
Collett, a New York-based British journalist whose Palestinian
abductors claim they killed him. His body was never found.
   Velayati said the matter ``is not in the hand of our
government'' but when asked if Iran would help to get the Britons
out of Lebanon, he said: ``We will do our best.'' He also said he
had been informed ``unofficially and informally'' of good news, but
he did not elaborate.
   The longest-held hostage is one of nine missing Americans,
Associated Press Chief Middle East Correspondent Terry Anderson,
who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Waite, 48, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987 after leaving a west Beirut
hotel for a rendezvous with Islamic Jihad, an underground
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem group that holds two American hostages.
   No group has claimed it is holding Waite. But an anonymous
telephone caller purporting to speak for Islamic Jihad, or Islamic
Holy War, claimed the group is holding Waite. The claim could not
be authenticated.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis, saying ``I want the
strongest team I possibly can,'' announced today that John Sasso,
who resigned under fire a year ago, was returning to the Democratic
presidential campaign as vice chairman.
   ``Almost a year ago, John Sasso made a very serious mistake,''
Dukakis told a news conference. ``He's paid the price.''
   Sasso resigned as campaign manager last Sept. 30 after it was
disclosed he was responsible for putting together and leaking a
videotape demonstrating that a rival Democratic candidate, Sen.
Joseph Biden Jr. of Delaware, was using without attribution the
campaign rhetoric of British Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock.
   The questioned passage came from a Kinnock speech in which he
described his personal background. Biden incorporated Kinnock's
words to describe his own background.
   Sasso resigned the day after Dukakis had told a news conference
that no one in his campaign was involved in leaking the videotape.
   Dukakis said he told Biden he wanted to bring Sasso back into
the campaign, and the senator ``could not have been more gracious.''
   Dukakis denied that Sasso's return was linked to his decline in
public opinion polls in his race against Republican nominee George
Bush.
   ``I want the strongest team I possibly can,'' he said, noting
that Labor Day _ next Monday _ is the traditional start of the
stretch drive of the presidential campaign.
   Dukakis described Sasso as ``a uniquely talented individual who
can provide real strength.''
   Asked if he thought Sasso's return would blunt Democratic
charges of ethical violations by members of the Reagan
administration, Dukakis replied that ``there was nothing illegal
about what John did.''
   As new vice chairman of the Dukakis campaign, Sasso will
undertake unspecified duties which the candidate said were
undetermined.
   He said Susan Estrich would remain as campaign manager, and Paul
Brountas would continue as campaign chairman.
   Dukakis' announcement came as he wound up a West Coast campaign
swing stressing his interest in education and accusing the Reagan
administration of trying to scuttle school programs.
   The Massachusetts governor's backers said the battle for
California's crucial 47 electoral votes was ``dead even.''
   Dukakis said Thursday that Bush had undergone ``an election-yar
conversion on the subject of education.''
   Dukakis was planning to continue that emphasis during
appearances today in Portland, Ore., and Spokane, Wash., as schools
open.
   Dukakis said the voters this fall would ``face a choice between
two very different ideas of prosperity and two very different
records of leadership.''
   He said it was a choice ``between those who see education as a
lifetime commitment and those who see it as an election year
strategy.''
   During the speech to teachers and school officials in Oakland,
Dukakis said the Reagan administration had eliminated remedial math
and reading programs for 500,000 poor children, had cut teacher
retraining and ``led an assault on college loans and grants.''
   By contrast, he said that in Massachusetts he had quadrupled
scholarship assistance to low- and middle-income students and
invested in Professional Development Centers to help teachers
update their skills.
   The Reagan administration unsuccessfully sought cuts in the
remedial programs in 1981. In an April 1988 report, the Education
Department said the number of children in remedial programs had
dropped from 5 million in 1979-80 to 4.5 million in the 1985-86
school year.
   ``While they've invested billions in Star Wars, we've developed
a regional network of star schools,'' Dukakis said.
   ``And where was George when all this was going on?'' Dukakis
said, echoing a theme from the Democratic convention last July.
``Where was the man who now says he wants to be the `education
president'?
   ``He was playing hooky. He was nowhere to be found.''
   Meanwhile, Anthony Podesta, who is running the Dukakis campaign
in California, said he now has 70 full-time employees, a number he
said would grow to 500 by mid-October.
   ``We're going to run a field organization beyond the
imagination,'' Podesta said. ``We'll have a precinct captain in
every precinct in the state _ 29,000 of them.''
   Podesta called the race between Dukakis and Bush ``dead even''
in California, an assessment also given by state Democratic
Assemblyman Tom Hayden.
   Hayden said California voters ``want change'' and that while
Dukakis ``promises change, he's also not a wild man.''
   ``Dukakis is the most acceptable Democratic candidate we've had
in a very long time statewide,'' he said.
   ``I don't think Bush conveys an image of change,'' Hayden said.
``He's been in office, he's the vice president, he's the
establishment.''
   At the same time, Hayden said Dukakis must reassure California
voters ``he's for stable defense spending,'' because of the large
number of defense-related companies in the state.

   The expected announcement that Jim Bakker
had signed papers to regain control of PTL was abruptly postponed
today.
   PTL's bankruptcy trustee said Thursday that Bakker was expected
to sign a deal today to pay $165 million to buy back the TV
ministry he lost in a sex-and-money scandal, and that the
evangelist could be back on the air by Sept. 9.
   But a news conference this morning was canceled by a PTL
spokeswoman who declined to give her name. She said the contract
would not be signed until Tuesday at the earliest.
   A source close to the negotiations, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said today a number of points still had to be worked
o to play teen-agers. Doris Day had nothing
on me.''
   Stricklyn empathized with Williams' own concerns about
depression, aging and the vicissitudes of life in the theater.
   ``I certainly felt I could identify from the point of view of a
career that had started off well as a young actor and then the
years when it wasn't working and I had to get out of the
business,'' he said.
   Stricklyn is working again, with seasons on TV's ``The Colbys''
and ``Dynasty'' behind him and a stint on the CBS series, ``Wise
Guy.''
   Following Edinburgh, Stricklyn takes ``Confessions'' to North
Carolina and then is hoping for a run in London.
   The experience, he said, has been cathartic in a way Williams
might have understood.
   ``Tennessee had a wonderful line: `If I get rid of my demons I
lose my angels,''' said Stricklyn. ``I'm trying to do everything in
reverse: to get rid of my demons and gain my angels.''

   Police seized seven tons of hashish in
the port of Barcelona and arrested 14 people in the Mediterranean
coastal province of Alicante to break up an international smuggling
ring, police said Friday.
   Police discovered the drug in a container on a ship in the port
of Barcelona, then placed the container under surveillance. Several
men later trucked the container south to this eastern city where
waiting police arrested the 14 alleged members of the ring.
   The people arrested included two Spaniards and 12 others of
British and Dutch nationality, he said.
   The largest hashish seizure was on July 24, when police
uncovered 17 tons of in a specially built vault on a cove near
Lloret del Mar, north of the northeastern Mediterranean city of
Barcelona. Six people were arrested.
   In recent years, Spain has become a major transport and
distribution entry point into Western Europe for traffickers of
hashish.

<HEAD>Sounds of Silince: Sweden Goes Three Minutes Without Culture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pavarotti stayed off the stage, movies
stopped in midreel, concert halls were hushed and radio programs
fell silent.
   Cultural life in Sweden came to a halt for three minutes at 8:15
p.m. Thursday when actors, musicians, dancers, and even librarians
protested what they called the low level of government support.
   Artists in most countries might be envious of the Swedes.
Stockholm, capital of a country of 8.4 million people, has as many
theaters as London. Artists can get state grants, but they say it
isn't enough to live on.
   State-supported theaters have launched the careers of director
Ingmar Bergman and actors such as Ingrid Bergman, Max von Sydow and
Ingrid Tulin.
   The nation which awards the Nobel prize for literature sells 2.5
million theater tickets a year, nearly one for every third person.
   In an article published Friday, actress Bibi Andersson protested
that the cultural assistance were too low, projects were too
vulnerable to cuts, and grants were too snagged in bureaucratic
tangles.
   ``Why do actors have to get swallowed up in bureaucracy? Why do
fiery spirits grow tired?'' she wrote in the Aftonbladet daily.
   ``What we wanted was to make culture an election issue,'' she
said, referring to the Sept. 18 national elections. ``It's a
question of priorities.''
   ``The strike was a success for the artists. They got a lot of
attention and managed to get their message across,'' said Martin
Lindbloom, spokesman of the Ministry of Education and Culture.
   In the west coast city of Goteborg, touring opera tenor Luciano
Pavarotti delayed the start of his performance by three minutes in
support of the strike. His audience stood in silence during that
time.
   One channel of the state-run television broke into its regular
program for live reports showing movie theaters with darkened
screens, silent stages and a candlelight vigil in Goteborg by 400
people. Two radio channels were quiet, while the third played Simon
and Garfunkel's ``Sounds of Silence.''
   At Stockholm's National Dramatic Theater, the staging of Eugene
O'Neill's ``Long Day's Journey Into Night'' gave the protest a
unique twist.
   At precisely 8:15 p.m., the young artist Edmund delivered his
line, ``I'm broke.'' Action froze on stage for three minutes, then
Edmund's father resumed the play with the reply: ``You're always
broke, and you always will be.''
   Official figures cited by Lindbloom say national support for the
arts is nearly as high in Sweden as in France, and more than
anywhere else in Europe.
   Direct yearly support amounts to $400 million, and municipal
subsidies to local cutural establishment is about $937 million,
Lindbloom said.
   Together with indirect help, such as building new museums or
libraries, Sweden spends about 1.5 percent of its gross national
product on the arts, he told the Associated Press.
   Although nothing has been trimmed from the national budget,
local authorities slash cultural projects first whenever they run
into trouble, complained Ingmar Bjorksten, the cultural affairs
correspondent for Svenska Dagbladet.
   Unemployment among artists is five times the national average of
just under 2 percent, Bjorksten wrote.
   ``The only way for culture to get more money is to make a
fuss,'' said Svante Weyner, head of Radio Sweden's cultural
division. Last year the radio cut the budget for a popular program
of radio plays. The budget was restored only after Ingmar Bergman
intervened.

   The nearly 9-month-old
rebellion against Israel has inspired new parents among the
Palestinians to give their babies such names as Uprising,
Revolution, Victory, Struggle and Sacrifice.
   An official at Al Ittihad Hospital in Nablus, one of the West
Bank's largest hospitals, said that of 247 births in the last two
weeks in July, 20 infants were given names connected with the
uprising.
   He cited Freedom and Liberation as other new names being given
Palestinian children, noting Liberation had been used for both boys
and girls.
   But the official, who asked not to be identified, said some
parents were hestitant for fear the names would not be allowed when
they went to register births with Israeli authorities.
   Atef Hajouj, of Bani Naim in the occupied West Bank, said he ran
into trouble when he named his daughter ``Intifadeh,'' the Arabic
word for uprising. He said officials at the Interior Ministry told
him the name was illegal.
   ``They told me to change her name or I will be fined,'' Hajouj,
24, said in an interview. ```One intifadeh is enough,' they said.''
   Hajouj's wife, Yussrah, insists the name is perfect for the
child, now 5 months old. ``It's very simple. She was born in the
victorious intifadeh and she deserves to be named Intifadeh,'' Mrs.
Hajouj said.
   Interior Ministry spokeswoman Tova Elinson said Israel has no
policy of preventing Palestinians from naming their children
whatever they wish.
   ``Everyone is allowed to register newborns, no matter what his
name,'' Ms. Elinson said. ``Some names may not be recorded when
several are recorded at once, but that's only because the computer
abbreviates them.''
   Rabah Manasreh, 29, from the same village, had her first baby on
April 2 and named the girl Nidaa, the Arabic word for ``appeal,''
because an uprising leaflet titled ``Appeal No. 12'' appeared that
day.
   ``I think it was a special day so I decided to name her Appeal
in memory of the intifadeh,'' Mrs. Manasreh said.``It is the least
support that I can give to the intifadeh.''
   In Bethlehem, 4-month-old Ansar Abed is named for the prison
where her father, Yasser, was jailed when she was born.
   Her 27-year-old father remains in the Negev desert prison camp
in Ketziot, which Palestinians call Ansar III after an Israeli
detention center at Ansar in Lebanon set up during Israel's
occupation of southern Lebanon.
   ``It was her father's wish,'' said his wife, Kifayah. ``He sent
messages through prisoners leaving the prison asking me to name the
baby Thaher, the Arabic word for `revolutionary' if it was a boy,
and Ansar if it was a girl.''
   ``The reason I named her Ansar is that the girl must know that
when she was born her father was detained in Ansar,'' she said.

<HEAD>Galilee Fishermen Suspected Of Poisoning Fish For Easy Catch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN IZENBERG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of dead fish were found floating on
the Jordan River, possibly poisoned by fishermen on the Sea of
Galilee looking for an easy catch, an official said Friday.
   ``We suspect large-scale poisoning using agricultural
pesticides,'' said Elad Zohar, an area supervisor.
   Zohar said the pesticides apparently were dumped in the Sea of
Galilee and killed more fish than the fishermen could catch.
Thousands of the poisoned fish then floated from the fresh water
lake into the narrow, winding Jordan River, he said.
   The Bible says the Sea of Galilee is where Jesus performed his
miracle of the fish and loaves, feeding 5,000 people from five
barley loaves of bread and two fish. It also is where he walked on
water to dispel doubts among his disciples.
   ``The damage caused by the poisoning is very great,'' Zohar told
The Associated Press. ``For every fish caught, three others are
rotting and washing ashore.''
   In addition, those caught still carry the poison in their
systems. Israel radio broadcast a warning, saying fresh water fish
should not be eaten.
   Zohar blamed the poisoning on ``marginal elements'' among the
Sea of Galilee's 180 commercial fishermen and said it wasn't the
first time it had happened.
   ``Poisoning usually takes place during low periods when fish are
hard to catch,'' Zohar said. ``It also happens when fishermen don't
feel like going out and working.''
   Zohar said thousands of fish died, primarily carp and St.
Peter's, named after the fisherman who became an apostle of Jesus.
   Alma Avni, a senior Health Ministry official, said the mass
poisoning may be related to the upcoming month of holy days,
including the Jewish New Year and Yom Kippur, during which fish is
a popular staple.
   She said poisoned fish eaten in small quantities would not harm
humans because it took much less poison to kill a fish than a human.
   But she cautioned fish-eaters ``to make certain the fish they
buy comes with a certificate showing where the fish were caught and
who caught them.''

<TEXT>
   A fiery George Bush stepped up his
attack on opponent Michael Dukakis' environmental record today,
accusing him of trying to pollute the New Jersey waters where
sewage has washed up on the beach this summer.
   The Republican presidential nominee spoke on a sunny beach that
in the past has been closed because of medical waste and sewage
washing ashore.
   Bush referred to the 1985 request from Dukakis as governor of
Massachusetts to dump his state's sewage off the New Jersey coast
at a site used by New Jersey and New York.
   Bush told a few hundred supporters in beach attire that the next
time Dukakis visits the state they should ``be sure to ask him why
did you want to dump Boston sludge off our coast in New Jersey. ...
Why did you pledge a clean ocean to the people of New Jersey when
your own state applied to pollute it?''
   Speaking on Thursday in Norwalk, Conn., of what he called the
``natural heritage that we all have to do something about,'' Bush
called himself a `Teddy Roosevelt Republican'' on the environment.
Roosevelt was an avid conservationist responsible for setting aside
millions of acres of forests and launching irrigation and
reclamation projects.
   Aware that Republicans and the Reagan administration in
particular are a target of unrelenting criticism by environmental
groups, Bush declared nonetheless, ``We're not going to give this
constituency away to the Democrats.''
   He recalled his acceptance speech at the Republican convention
last month when he said he wanted to make the United States ``a
gentler nation.''
   ``This is part of what I mean, a nation in which all of us treat
the environment with greater reverence and greater respect,'' he
said.
   Today Bush was continuing his effort to pull votes from the
environmentally-minded with speeches to residents of Belmar Beach
and later in New Castle, Del.
   Bush sought to embarrass Dukakis on a day when the Boston Herald
headlined a new poll that put him neck-and-neck with the governor
in Massachusetts.
   ``Fantastic,'' Bush said when reporters showed him the newspaper.
   ``I can't believe it,'' he said. ``In Massachusetts?''
   The Herald survey found Dukakis and Bush tied in the state at 42
percent each. The poll of 400 likely voters conducted Wednesday had
a 5-point margin of error.
   A poll for the Herald in July found Dukakis leading by 14
percentage points.
   In his Boston Harbor tour, Bush laid the fault on Dukakis for
failing to clean up the harbor, which has become a major
embarrassment to the state, with half a billion gallons of raw
sewage being dumped in daily. Construction of new wastewater
treatment facilities is now beginning under federal court order.
   He said Dukakis had been intent on delay, to do ``anything but
clean up'' the sewage and sludge and twice sought federal waivers
of the Clean Air Act requirement for secondary treatment of sewage.
   ``I don't call that leadership, and I certainly don't call that
competence,'' he said in reference to Dukakis' statement that
voters should look for competence in this presidential race.
   In his first term as governor Dukakis prepared a waiver request
to the federal government, but it actually was filed by his
successor Gov. Ed King in 1979.
   Dukakis filed the second waiver request in 1984. In 1985, the
Environmental Protection Agency sued the state to force a cleanup.
   Bush also criticized Dukakis for promising to end the dumping
that has left medical waste cluttering New Jersey beaches, when
Dukakis himself as governor asked for federal permission to dump
waste off New Jersey.
   ``The stealth candidate is at it again, making promises on one
hand but hiding his secret record on the other,'' Bush said.
   The 1985 Massachusetts request to the EPA was for temporary
permission to dump 106 miles offshore where New York and New Jersey
were already dumping. A compromise arrangement allowed
Massachusetts to dump further out beyond the continental shelf.
   Standing on a Boston ferry boat off of Deer Island, the future
site of a new sewage treatment plant near the harbor mouth, Bush
called for a ban on ocean dumping of sewage sludge after 1991, and
for greater Coast Guard efforts and FBI participation in catching
violators.

   Burma's first legal privately owned
newspaper in 26 years began publishing Friday, and it said it would
present the ``true and unbiased news.''
   In its four pages, the People's View printed photographs and
accounts of demonstrations in Rangoon against the authoritarian
government, and of student protests last month outside the Burmese
embassies in Thailand and Bangladesh.
   It also carried the full text of President Maung Maung's address
to the nation Thursday in which he rejected calls for an interim
government to lead Burma back to democracy, which ended with a
military coup in 1962.
   People's View said it would be enlarged and carry foreign news
when conditions improved, and declared in its first editorial:
   ``Under the current conditions of scarcity of newsprint, ink and
other materials, the first privately owned newspaper is published
to cater to the people with true and unbiased news of the
prevailing situation.''
   It did not editorialize about the political turmoil in Burma.
   No price was printed on the front page, but People's View was
selling for up to 34 cents, several times the cost of the generally
distrusted government newspapers.
   The new morning paper's owner and publisher is Kyaw Nyein and
the editor is Tun Tha, sports editor of the government-run
newspaper Kyemon. People's View is licensed by the government but
not controlled by it.
   Rangoon's six other dailies, two in English four in Burmese, are
owned by the government.
   Twenty-one privately owned newspapers were published in Rangoon
before the coup by Gen. Ne Win, who nationalized all newspapers,
radio stations and television stations.
   Aye Ko, vice chairman of the State Council, told the legislature
Aug. 19 the government would permit privately run newspapers,
journals and magazines so as to ``provide an opportunity to bring
out the people's wants and desires and accurate news about what's
happening at work places and in regions.''
   Maung Maung assumed power the same day as the first civilian
leader since Ne Win's military coup.
   Ne Win resigned late in July and was succeeded by Sein Lwin, a
hard-line former general, who was driven from office in 17 days by
huge protests against 26 years of isolation and economic disaster.
   Employees of the government newspapers went on strike last
month, demanding greater press freedom, and kept the newspapers off
the streets for three days. They returned to work Aug. 28, saying
they had been assured their demands would be met.
   Several unauthorized newspapers have appeared, poorly printed
but selling for up to $1.

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An advertising executive who succeeded in getting
his Russian wife and 1-year-old son out of the Soviet Union was
convicted today of assaulting them nine days after they arrived in
Canada.
   Kirby Inwood was found guilty of assault causing bodily harm on
his wife and of common assault on the boy. Assault carries a
maximum sentence of 10 years in Canada but offenders are often
sentenced to six months or less.
   Provincial court Judge Gordon Hachborn rendered his verdict
following a sensational trial that involved tales of sex, greed and
violence.
   Inwood, 44, of Toronto, maintained throughout the trial that his
wife, Tanya Sidorova, was a money hungry ``Russian yuppie'' who
lured him into marriage to get out of the Soviet Union. He said she
fabricated a story of the assault as a way to end their marriage.
   Ms. Sidorova, 32, told of a vicious beating in which she was
punched, kicked, choked and thrown barely conscious from her
Toronto home. She said her son, Misha, was also assaulted by a
drunken Inwood.
   Hachborn said he felt Ms. Sidorova was exaggerating. But he said
he had concluded that Inwood ``was fabricating his evidence. I came
to believe that the more I heard him testify.''
   Hachborn said there was ``an aura of unreality about what the
accused said occurred between him and his wife.''
   The trial attracted daily headlines and drew crowds to the
courtroom.
   At one point, women's groups picketed the courthouse, alleging
battered women couldn't get a fair shake in the justice system.
   Inwood testified he and Ms. Sidorova slept together the day they
met in Leningrad in 1986. But he questioned whether Misha was his
child, testifying he was often impotent.
   The couple married soon after Christmas 1986 and Misha was born
in September 1987. But the Soviet government refused to let Ms.
Sidorova emigrate to Canada, claiming she was a security risk.
   That began a yearlong campaign by Inwood, during which he spent
thousands of dollars lobbying government officials in both
countries and pleaded in the press for her release.
   When Moscow relented, Inwood said he was ``deliriously happy.''
   ``I felt like the white knight rescuing the fairy princess,'' he
said at his trial. But the fairy tale turned into a horror story.
   Inwood said Ms. Sidorova changed as soon as she arrived in
Canada. He said she criticized his home and an emerald ring he gave
her and pressured him to buy her a Corvette and a fur coat.
   Ms. Sidorova painted a picture of Inwood as an abusive, violent
man who threatened to kill her and Misha.
   On the night Inwood was arrested, she testified, he ``beat me
like a wild animal, like a beast.''
   Sentencing arguments were being held following announcement of
the verdict.

<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission should order
Toyota to directly notify owners of secret warranties on cars made
by the Japanese company, the Center for Auto Safety said in a
petition filed Friday.
   ``The Toyota documents clearly show that the company has an
internal policy that systematically reimburses consumers for
failure of specific components beyond the written warranty,'' said
Sam Cole of the center, a consumers group often critical of the
automakers and their regulators.
   ``Certainly ... every Toyota owner should be made aware,'' of
the policy, he said.
   An internal Toyota document, published last month by The Detroit
News, listed 41 components for which Toyota Motor Sales USA could
be reimbursed by its Japanese parent company.
   The document said an attachment was a ``complete `Secret
Warranty' listing.''
   After the document was published, Toyota said the listing
referred to reimbusement beyond the normal warranties under the
company's customer satisfaction policy rather than to secret
warranties.
   The center a year ago asked the FTC to require all manufacturers
to disclose secret warranties.

Attack</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis, trying to regain momentum for his
presidential campaign, said today he was rehiring former campaign
aide John Sasso because ``I want the strongest team I possibly
can'' for the battle against Republican nominee George Bush.
   Bush meanwhile appeared before vacationers on the sands of
Belmar Beach, N.J., to press his attack on Dukakis' environmental
record as Massachusetts governor.
   Dukakis, he said, ``fought to allow Boston sludge to be dumped
off New Jersey's shore _ the very shore on which he had the nerve
to stand and promise clean water.'' Bush added sarcastically:
``Nice guy.''
   Dukakis, winding up a campaign swing through the West Coast,
announced in San Jose, Calif., that he was bringing back the former
campaign manager who had resigned last Sept. 30 after Sasso
admitted helping torpedo the campaign of party rival Joseph Biden
of Delaware.
   Dukakis said Sasso, who will be vice chairman of his campaign,
was ``a uniquely talented individual who can provide real
strength.''
   The governor denied that Sasso's return was linked to Dukakis'
recent decline in public opinion polls in his race against Bush.
   A Dukakis campaign source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Dukakis plans to announce that former campaign manager John
Sasso will return to the campaign as vice chairman.
   Sasso had previously engineered Dukakis's successful campaign to
recapture the Massachusetts governorship after a term out of
office, and directed Dukakis's presidential campaign until he
resigned in September 1987.
   Sasso left after admitting that he circulated a videotape
demonstrating Biden had borrowed without attribution some deeply
personal remarks by British politician Neil Kinnock. Only two days
earlier, Dukakis said he had been assured no one on his campaign
staff was the source of the video tape.
   Dukakis and Bush took advantage of the timely concerns _ the
opening of school and a summer haunted by the specter of
waste-strewn shorelines _ to go after voters before the official
Labor Day opening of the campaign season.
   ``While they've invested billions in Star Wars, we've developed
a regional network of star schools,'' Dukakis said Thursday in
California while contrasting his achievements as Massachusetts
governor with the inaction of the Reagan administration.
   ``Where was the man who now says he wants to be the `education
president'?'' Dukakis said in Oakland. ``He was playing hooky. He
was nowhere to be found.''
   He charged the Reagan administration has eliminated remedial
math and reading programs for 500,000 poor children, cut teacher
retraining, and ``led an assault on college loans and grants.''
   He said that in Massachusetts he had quadrupled scholarship
assistance to low- and middle-income students and invested in
Professional Development Centers to help teachers update their
skills.
   The Reagan administration sought cuts in the remedial programs
in 1981 but was unsuccessful. In an April 1988 report, the
Education Department said the number of children in remedial
programs had dropped from 5 million in 1979-80 to 4.5 million in
the 1985-86 school year.
   Dukakis was planning to continue that emphasis during
appearances today in Portland, Ore., and Spokane, Wash., as he
courts the Reagan Democrats _ Democrats who voted Republican in the
1980 and 1984 presidential elections.
   Bush, after a rally Thursday into Dukakis' backyard, where he
charged the governor failed to act swiftly against pollution in
Boston Harbor, continued his campaign as a ``lifelong
environmentalist'' on the Delaware and New Jersey shores. Dukakis
called Bush's newfound commitment an ``election-year conversion.''
   Bush also criticized Dukakis for promising to end the dumping
that has left medical waste cluttering New Jersey beaches, when
Dukakis himself as governor asked for federal permission to dump
waste off New Jersey.
   ``The stealth candidate is at it again, making promises on one
hand but hiding his secret record on the other,'' Bush said.
   The 1985 Massachusetts request to the EPA was for temporary
permission to dump 106 miles offshore where New York and New Jersey
were dumping already. A compromise arrangement allowed
Massachusetts to dump farther out beyond the continental shelf.
   Speaking in Norwalk, Conn., Bush called himself a ``Teddy
Roosevelt Republican'' on the environment. Roosevelt was an avid
conservationist responsible for setting aside millions of acres of
forests and launching irrigation and reclamation projects.
   Aware that Republicans and the Reagan administration in
particular are a target of unrelenting criticism by environmental
groups, Bush declared nonetheless, ``We're not going to give this
constituency away to the Democrats.''
   Bush's incursion in Massachusetts was more than physical. A
Boston Herald poll released published Thursday showed he and
Dukakis to be neck and neck in Massachusetts. ``Fantastic,'' Bush
said, when given the news.
   Dukakis, meanwhile, was reported today to be resurrecting his
fallen campaign manager, John Sasso, who resigned last year after
it was revealed that he provided videotapes to the news media
showing Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del.,
   
   
   The Herald survey found Dukakis and Bush tied in the state at 42
percent each. The poll of 400 likely voters conducted Wednesday had
a five percentage point margin of error. A poll for the Herald in
July found Dukakis leading by 14 percentage points.
   Dukakis spokesman Dayton Duncan countered: ``We're very
confident Michael Dukakis will carry Massachusetts. We're also
confident he will carry George Bush's other home states: Maine,
Texas, Washington, D.C., and any others he claims.''
   Jesse Jackson, in Atlanta for a meeting to plan voter
registration strategy, tried to put an end to reports that tension
was rising between his supporters and the Dukakis camp.
   ``I would hate to wake up on the morning of Nov. 9 (the day
after the election) and hate to think that we lost by the lack of
my work,'' he said, promising to campaign for the ticket and the
party in general.
   Republican vice presidential nominee, Sen. Dan Quayle of
Indiana, continued his Southern swing today after touring a watch
plant in Little Rock, Ark., and watching a high school football
practice in Jackson, Miss.
   Quayle was asked at one point about a forthcoming article in The
New Republic which said a public relations firm run by Quayle's
campaign manager, Stuart Spencer, was paid $350,000 in 1984-85 to
lobby for Panamanian ruler Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Advance copies of the article say the firm lobbied against drug
investigations of Noriega and defended him against allegations of
killing former president Dr. Hugo Spadafora in September 1985.
   Quayle said he did not ``know about the specifics'' of the story.
   ``From my observation, Stuart Spencer is a political pro,''
Quayle said.
   The Democratic vice presidential nominee, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of
Texas, was on vacation.

<HEAD>Israeli Analysts Say Soviets Expanding Tartus-Arwad Base</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Soviets are expanding naval facilities in
the Syrian port of Tartus and the neighboring island of Arwad to
counter the U.S. presence in the Mediterranean, Israeli analysts
said Friday.
   Soviet installations in Tartus, including submarine and surface
ship maintenance facilities, constitute the largest Soviet naval
base in the Mediterranean, said Dore Gold of Tel Aviv University's
Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies.
   Aharon Levran, editor of The Middle East Military Balance
published this week by the center, said the facilities extend to
Arwad island and include recreation facilities for Soviet crews.
   Gold said no declassified information was available on the
current or planned size of the Soviet base, but that the general
and continuing trend has been expansion since 1987.
   He said the Soviet navy's Mediterranean Squadron is using
Tartus, about 200 miles north of Tel Aviv, because it is outside
Soviet territory and has good access to the Mediterranean.
   The Soviets use other land installations in Syria for
intelligence-gathering, Gold and Levran said in separate interviews.
   Gold said the main objective of the Tartus base expansion was to
counter the U.S. 6th Fleet presence in the Mediterranean.
   The United States has bases in Spain, Italy, Greece and France.
The Soviet Union had to find new arrangements after Albania shifted
its alliance to China in 1961 and Egypt dropped its friendship
treaty with Moscow in 1976, he said.
   Gold said the Tartus facility was important for prolonged
deployment of Soviet attack submarines in the Mediterranean.
   The London-based Jane's Defense Weekly in May called Tartus
``the primary maintenance facility for Soviet submarines operating
in the Mediterranean.''
   Levran said the Soviets have been using Tartus for at least five
years and that the base's expansion apparently was a price Syria
had to pay for purchasing Soviet weapons.
   Despite the Kremlin's recent reluctance to supply Syria with
advanced weapons systems, he said, ``Syria is still the Soviet
Union's strategic asset in the Middle East.''
   He said the base replaced the Soviet practice of using
Mediterranean Squadron ships for maintenance. But he said the base
was less important than the recently developed Soviet Far Eastern
base in Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam.

   Saturday's election in Singapore will pass the
torch of leadership to a younger generation, but the man who has
led this prosperous Asian city-state since 1959 is not expected to
retire.
   The governing People's Action Party is expected to win the
parliamentary election by a big margin. Prime Minister Lee Kuan
Yew, who will be 65 on Sept. 16, is expected to step down in favor
of First Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, 46.
   Lee, who called the election ``truly a watershed,'' has been
prime minister since 1959 and more than half of the 2.6 million
people have known no other leader.
   He is to remain secretary-general of the PAP and, although he
has expressed disinterest, is still regarded as the most logical
candidate to be the country's first elected president.
   ``Those who believe that when I have left the government as
prime minister, that I have gone into permanent retirement, really
should have their heads examined,'' Lee said recently.
   The proposed elected presidency remained the key issue as the
nine-day campaign wound down Friday. It would replace the current
appointed ceremonial post with a president holding veto power over
spending the nation's ample financial reserves and nominations to
senior civil service and judicial positions.
   Even the most optimistic of opposition leaders do not expect to
be able to muster enough votes to form a government.
   The Singapore Democratic Party under Chaim See Tong, the only
opposition member when the last Parliament was dissolved, would
settle for denying the PAP the two-thirds majority needed to amend
the Constitution. ``Save democracy now. Deny them two-thirds,'' is
the slogan for the party's 18 candidates.
   The biggest opposition challenge was posed by the Workers'
Party, which fielded 32 candidates. But Secretary-General J.B.
Jeyaretnam, who won election with Chaim at the last polls in 1984,
was disqualified from Parliament for five years from 1986 for
falsifying party accounts.
   The PAP won 77 of the 79 seats in 1984 but was shocked by a 12.6
percent drop in total popular vote to 62.9 percent. The opposition
gain was attributed to several issues, including a proposal to bar
the withdrawal of savings from the Central Provident Fund, a
mandatory Social Security-like program, at age 55.
   Senior party officials now make regular ``walkabouts'' to press
the flesh and sample public opinion. Controversial proposals, such
as the elected presidency, are no longer rammed through Parliament
on the strength of a two-thirds majority.
   The party has tried to lure voters by promising welfare
recipients more money and recommending wage increases after two
years of official restraint caused by recession.
   Parents were told they may use Central Provident Fund savings to
finance college educations for their children. The national day
celebrations this month were made extra festive with a
government-sanctioned street party that attracted 250,000 revelers.
   ``More good years'' is the PAP slogan. The party takes credit
for a booming economy that generated 11.2 percent growth in
inflation-adjusted terms in the first half of the year.
   Singaporeans enjoy one of the highest living standards in Asia,
and 86 percent of them live in apartments built by a government
that is is generally perceived to be efficient and relatively free
of corruption.
   The recently enlarged unicameral Parliament now has 81 seats,
and the legislators serve five-year terms. The PAP already has 11
seats where it was running unopposed.
   The PAP needs to win at least 30 more seats to get a simple
majority of 41 to form a new government and run the country for the
eighth consecutive term since 1959.
   It faces 141 candidates from seven opposition parties and four
independents. Opposition candidates numbered only 51 in the last
election.
   There are 42 traditional single-member voting districts. But for
the first time, each party competing in 13 constituencies had to
nominate three candidates, at least one of them from a minority
group. Voters select a team of three and each gets a separate vote
in Parliament.
   Singapore's 2 million people are 76 percent ethnic Chinese,
about 15 percent Malay and six percent Indians.
   Voting is compulsory for the 1.5 million eligible voters in the
70 contested districts. Voting hours Saturday are from 8 a.m. to 8
p.m., with results expected about midnight.

   A man has been charged with the murder
of a woman whose body was discovered under a motel bed, days after
she was killed and guests continued to use the room, police said
Friday.
   Detective Sgt. Dennis Barry said Cornelius Walls, 49, of
Hempstead was arrested Thursday. With him, Barry said, was a
26-year-old woman who claimed she had been held against her will
for three days, and that Walls had raped and sodomized her.
   Walls was charged with second-degree murder in the death of Mary
DeOliviera of Elmont. Walls also faced charges of kidnapping, rape
and sodomy for the attack on the woman who was with him, Barry said.
   Her body was under a bed at the Oceanside Motel for at least
four days before a maintenance worker investigating complaints of a
foul odor found the body Monday. Police said her husband had
reported her missing.
   Barry said Walls was arrested based on information gathered at
the murder scene.

   A ravioli factory employee was pulled
into a dough-kneading machine, and rescuers had to bring the
machine to the hospital along with the man, authorities said.
   Calvin Knight of Mount Vernon was in stable condition Friday.
   Knight had disappeared completely in the six-foot-tall machine
Thursday at John's Ravioli Co., said Fire Commissioner Raymond
Kiernan.
   Kiernan said rescuers had to work for more than an hour before
Knight and the machine could be transported to New Rochelle
Hospital, where the blades used to knead the dough were removed.
   Knight underwent surgery and may regain most of the use of his
right arm, a spokeswoman at New Rochelle Hospital said.
   Henry Guanero, an employee at the factory, said Knight was
cleaning his machine at the end of the day when the accident
occurred.
   Neither factory officials nor the police were able to determine
exactly why Knight was pulled into the machine.

   Sen. Dan Quayle attacked Democratic
nominee Michael Dukakis on Friday as ``flat wrong'' on defense and
foreign policy issues, and promised that Republican candidate
George Bush will be the American farmer's friend.
   Quayle, who is Bush's vice presidential running mate told an
Alabama audience that farmers should not have to compete against
``illegal subsidies'' that lower the prices of goods produced
overseas.
   ``As long as we can get that level playing field, the American
farmer will out-produce and be more competitive than any farmers in
the world,'' Quayle said.
   If the Bush-Quayle ticket is elected in November, he said,
``we're going to put the State Department on the side of the farmer
instead being on the side of the trading partners.''
   In a blast at Dukakis, Quayle said the Republican and Democratic
candidates disagree most sharply in their approach to national
defense.
   ``We believe in a strong national defense to deter aggression
against America, and he does not,'' Quayle said.
   ``On matters of national defense and foreign policy, believe me,
our opponent is not even half right. He's just flat wrong,'' Quayle
said.
   He said Dukakis needed ``some education about the defense of
America'' because of his opposition to the Star Wars space-based
missile defense system, the MX missile and other deterrent weapons
systems backed by the Reagan administration.
   ``Michael Dukakis needs an education _ that's for sure. But the
people ... are not about to let him get his on-the-job training in
the Oval Office at the expense of our security,'' Quayle said.
   Quayle's schedule called for a visit to Orlando, Fla., for a
student rally at the University of Central Florida, a GOP
fund-raising event and a tour of a laser research facility.

<TEXT>
   Seattle's worst-ever power outage will keep many
downtown businesses and apartment houses in the dark into the Labor
Day weekend, officials said.
   Utility officials Thursday said replacement of thousands of feet
of fire-damaged cable was taking more time than expected.
   Julia Greenlee, a City Light spokeswoman, said the expected time
for restoring electricity to the 40-block area had been pushed back
from tonight or Saturday morning to Saturday afternoon or evening.
   ``Maybe we were being too optimistic in our original estimate,''
Ms. Greenlee said.
   A smoky fire of undetermined origin wrecked an underground vault
containing two transformers and switching equipment Wednesday,
cutting electricity to much of the city's retail, financial and
hotel core and closing numerous businesses.
   Many restaurants that tried to stay open with limited service
were closed by health inspectors concerned about food spoilage and
potential sanitation problems.
   ``I probably closed 15 to 20 places myself,'' said Janet
Anderberg, senior environmental health specialist with the
Seattle-King County Health Department. ``We had places that were
cooking with candles and washing their hands without hot water.''
   No serious injuries have been reported, nor were there any
reports of looting as police increased patrols in the area.
   At Stewart House, residents pooled the contents of defrosting
refrigerators and held a barbecue in the courtyard for low-income
elderly and disabled residents.
   Generators were provided by City Light for five hotels with a
large share of elderly residents.
   About 70 City Light workers labored through the night Thursday,
Ms. Greenlee said.
   Authorities have refused to estimate the number of affected
businesses, workers and residents, dozens of whom have been
relocated until power is restored.
   Isabel Boldrin, 87, said she walked down 23 flights from her
place in a 26-story condominium to wash at a department store just
outside the outage area.
   The power failure left her without elevator service, and
residents of the upper 22 floors also were without water, she said.
   The almost complete blackout of banks in the area could leave
many residents who rely on government checks short of cash over the
Labor Day weekend.
   ``I talked to a lot of people today who were down to counting
their dimes and quarters,'' said the Rev. Carol Ludden, ``and you
can't go out to eat on dimes and quarters.''

<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of Burmese
demonstrated for immediate democracy Friday and dissident leaders
called for more protests, rejecting President Maung Maung's pledge
of a referendum on one-party rule.
   A Western diplomat said he had reports that students, Buddhist
monks and others had taken over about 40 town governments because
of continued strikes, demonstrations and defections of officials.
   In Moulmein, the Mon state capital 50 miles east of Rangoon, a
resident said the government had been paralyzed since early August
by strikes of city employees.
   The report said an 11-member committee formed by the state's
Buddhist monk organization was running the city and citizen patrols
handled security.
   More than 10,000 striking government employees in Moulmein
rallied Friday against Maung Maung's referendum plan, denouncing it
as an attempt to prolong the 26-year rule of the Burma Socialist
Program Party.
   About 300,000 people, including striking government workers and
policemen, held a rally for democracy in Monywa and rejected the
president's plea for a return to work, a resident said. The city is
400 miles northwest of Rangoon.
   Maung Maung expressed sympathy with the protesters in a speech
Thursday, but said he must respect constitutional procedures and
cannot bow to demands for an interim government.
   He said the party leadership would meet Sept. 12 to consider
holding a referendum on one-party rule that could lead to a
multiparty system.
   Protesters from all segments of society blame the party, which a
military coup brought to power in 1962, for brutal repression and
for rigid socialist policies that have visited economic ruin on a
nation rich in natural resources.
   The Western diplomat said of the reaction to Maung Maung's
speech: ``They think it's not enough. They cannot trust the
government to carry out its promise.''
   He said protesters were calling for large-scale demonstrations
Sept. 8, but strikes and protests already are daily events and it
was not clear what more could be done.
   Former Defense Minister Tin Oo, a leading dissident, said
Friday: ``It is no longer necessary to hold a referendum. The whole
country has rejected one-party rule. Only an interim government
will be able to reactivate the stalled administration and ease the
situation.''
   Similar responses came from the new League for Democracy and
Peace, made up by elder statesmen and military officers led by
former President Win Maung, and the Rangoon Lawyers' Council, a
government-sponsored group.
   A statement by the lawyers said the shooting of demonstrators
and indefinite detention of suspects last month violated the
constitution.
   ``It is ridiculous to talk about constitutionality by the
government that has violated the constitution on various
occasions,'' the statement said. ``The national sentiment against
one-party rule is evident by demonstrations throughout the nation.''
   Maung Maung said Thursday the government would legalize student
unions, banned since 1962, and rebuild the Rangoon University
Student Union Building, which the army destroyed in suppressing
dissent that year.
   About 3,000 students, rejecting that, marched through Rangoon's
streets in the green dress-like school uniforms called longyis.
Among them were children of kindergarten age.
   With thousands of other marchers, including government workers,
the young Burmese shouted: ``The students' cause and the people's
cause are indivisible!''
   A 17-year-old student leader called Maung Maung's speech ``a
cunning trick to divide students from the people,'' and declared:
``We will continue to demonstrate until the one-party regime is
replaced by a democratic regime.''
   Friday's rallies in Rangoon were peaceful and far fewer people
participated than the estimated 100,000 who turned out the day
before.
   A Western diplomat in Thailand said he believes former ruler Ne
Win will flee Burma. On Thursday, a senior officer of the Foreign
Trade Bank in Rangoon said members of his entourage had tried to
transfer 18 million kyats ($3 million) to London but the bank
refused.
   Ne Win led the 1962 military coup, and after 26 years of rule
resigned July 23, taking indirect responsibility for student-led
riots in March and June.
   Sein Lwin, a hard-line former general, succeded him and protests
followed. At least 112 people were killed in Rangoon alone, by
official count, but unofficial reports put the toll much higher.
   After 17 days Sein Lwin resigned and was replaced by Maung
Maung, the first civilian leader since 1962.

   A passenger train carrying more than 150
people derailed today, and three of its cars tumbled down a steep
embankment, killing six people, police said.
   A police spokesman said 29 people were injured, including two
Americans and at least 13 other foreign tourists.
   Earlier, police reported seven people were killed.
   The police spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity in
accordance with Greek practice, said the train was on its way from
Athens to Patras in western Greece.
   The six-car train derailed along a rocky coastline near this
resort area 35 miles west of Athens.
   ``We were going along and suddenly the train started falling. I
fell through the window and broke my arm, that's all I can
remember,'' a 23-year-old Czech passenger said from his hosptial
bed.
   The six victims and many of the injured had been sitting in the
two end cars, a medic at the scene told The Associated Press.
   ``Many of the passengers were crushed to death after they were
flung out of the windows. There were dismembered pieces of bodies
all over the place,'' said the medic, who declined to give his name.
   Several of the injured were reported to be suffering from shock.
   The police spokesman said the injured foreigners included seven
Britons, two Czechs, two Spaniards, an Argentine and a Finn. None
were in serious condition except for the Finnish woman, who
suffered a broken back.

<TEXT>
   Scrawling your John Hancock across the back of a
paycheck may not be enough to get it cashed anymore, no matter how
large your bank account or how well you know your teller.
   A new federal law guaranteeing customers faster access to their
deposits includes little-known, uniform standards for endorsing
checks.
   Under the regulations, which took effect Thursday, all
endorsements must be within a 1{-inch section along the edge of the
back of the check so they don't interfere with endorsements from
the bank at which the check is deposited.
   Only ``appropriate color ink,'' such as blue and black, may be
used by banks for their endorsements, according to the regulations
administered by the Federal Reserve Board.
   Financial institutions say they have been training employees and
mailing out brochures with diagrams to educate customers on the new
standards.
   Robert Hutchinson, a senior vice president from Manufacturers
Hanover Trust in New York, said there have been few problems so far.
   ``I'm unaware of any excessive long lines,'' he said. ``(But)
let's be honest, there's going to be an adjustment period. It's
going to take time for everyone to understand and adjust to the
rules.''
   Some bank employees said privately they were bracing for a few
initial headaches.
   Incorrect customer endorsements, they said, could delay check
clearing and might affect subsequent transactions based on money
derived from that check.
   ``It won't be the bank's problem; it's the customer's problem.
But we'll be hearing about it,'' said one branch manager of a large
New York-based bank.
   Stores also have had to adjust to the new guidelines. Many
businesses routinely stamp the backs of checks with a lengthy list
of identification items store clerks must obtain from customers.
   As a result, stores have had to buy new rubber stamps or
reprogram cash registers to print within the smaller endorsement
area.
   The Fed has defended the new requirements as necessary to speed
check-clearing so that bounced checks can be returned quickly to
the institution where they were cashed.
   The new rules require financial institutions to give customers
access to deposited funds within one, three or seven days,
depending on the type of check.
   Consumer groups had complained that too many banks were holding
funds for periods as long as two or three weeks before making the
money available to the depositor, a practice that cost Americans
millions of dollars in interest.

   Dan Quayle's health is excellent and the
Republican vice presidential candidate suffers only from slightly
high cholesterol levels and minor skin and nasal problems, a
doctor's report released Quayle's office said Friday.
   Based on an Aug. 1 examination and a study of the Indiana
senator's medical and family history, Dr. Robert Krasner, senior
assistant attending physician at the U.S. Capitol, pronounced
Quayle healthy.
   ``In summary, you are a 41-year-old white male in excellent
health without any active problems,'' Krasner wrote in a letter to
Quayle dated Aug. 29.
   Quayle's cholesterol level of 228 is ``marginally elevated'' and
can be reduced by proper diet and exercise, Krasner wrote. The
senator rides a stationary bicycle one to three times weekly and
does not smoke, the report said.
   The doctor said Quayle suffers from a minor nosebleeding problem
and an unspecified seasonal allergy that causes nasal swelling, for
which he uses a nasal spray.
   The senator also has a slight skin condition on his face caused
by exposure to the sun. He treats the skin condition, called
actinic keratosis, with liquid nitrogen. The doctor recommended
that Quayle have the condition examined periodically and that he
use a sun screen.
   The candidate had a small rectal tear in the past, but the
August examination found no evidence of the problem persisting.
Krasner suggested an anal examination within the next year.
   Quayle is 5 feet 10 inches tall, weighs 176{ pounds, has 20-20
vision and had a precisely normal temperature reading of 98.6
degrees, the report said.
   The senator's office released Krasner's letter and summaries of
the doctor's findings and the laboratory results.

<TEXT>
   ``The A-Team'' fought its last battle on
television years ago but won another one in court in a copyright
suit by the writer of an unsuccessful TV pilot about another crew
of Vietnam vets.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday upheld a
judge's ruling that NBC had not copied the action-adventure series
from a screenplay called ``Cargo'' by Ernest Olson.
   Olson's script involved three Vietnam veterans who had conducted
scams during the war and were looking to continue them in civilian
life over the opposition of their former superior officers, who had
become corrupt drug agents.
   ``The A-Team'' involved the adventures of four Vietnam vets,
three of whom were unjustly court-martialed in Vietnam, escaped
from prison and were on the run. Its stars included Mr. T and
George Peppard.
   A federal jury in Los Angeles found that the series was
substantially similar to ``Cargo'' and that NBC had access to
Olson's work before putting on ``The A-Team.'' But the judge
overruled the jury, finding no substantial similarity.
   In a 3-0 decision, the appeals court said the two works were
action-adventure series designed to show Vietnam veterans in a
favorable light, and there was some resemblance between the leading
characters. But the court said the similarities fell far short of
the evidence needed for copyright infringement.
   The court noted also that Olson had defined the characters in
``Cargo'' with descriptions of only a few lines each.

   An explosion rocked downtown
Durban just after the evening rush hour today, extensively damaging
a clothing store and slightly injuring a black woman, police said.
   In other cities, a hand grenade was tossed at the home of South
Africa's leading mixed-race politician, and a bomb exploded in a
post office, but no injuries were reported in those attacks.
   Glass and concrete littered one of Durban's main streets
following the 5:45 p.m. blast, witnesses said. The explosion
occurred inside a street-level clothing store, causing major damage
to the shop and two adjacent stores, witnesses said.
   The street was largely deserted at the time of the explosion,
but had been full of traffic less than an hour earlier. Police
initially said no one was hurt, but later said a black woman
suffered minor injuries.
   The grenade attack in the Cape Province town of Uitenhage
damaged a parked car but did not hit the house of Rev. Allan
Hendrickse. The mine exploded inside a package at the post office
in Stranderton, southeast of Johannesburg.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for any of the
attacks.
   More than 100 bombings have been reported in South Africa under
the 26-month state of emergency. Police have blamed virtually all
of the attacks on the outlawed African National Congress, the main
black group fighting to overthrow the white-dominated government.
   On Wednesday, a bombing destroyed a Johannesburg office building
used by anti-apartheid groups and explosions Thursday in Windhoek,
the capital of South-West Africa.
   Two people were killed and 15 injured Thursday when a bomb went
off at a hotel in Windhoek, the capital of South-West Africa, and a
mine exploded later alongside a railroad track near the city in the
South African-ruled territory. No injuries were reported in the
railroad bombing. Officials earlier had said two people were
injured.
   South Africa's chief representative in the territory, Louis
Pienaar, blamed the hotel bombing on pro-independence guerrillas of
the South-West African People's Organization. But SWAPO, which
began observing a voluntary cease-fire Thursday, denied the
allegation and blamed it on ``South Africa's dirty tactics.''
   Political and community leaders have expressed fears that the
attacks signal an escalation of retaliatory attacks by
anti-apartheid militants and by right-wing extremists.
   Hendrickse, leader of the Labor Party that controls the
mixed-race chamber of Parliament, was not at his home when the
grenade exploded about 1:05 a.m., but two of his children were in
the house.
   
   Anti-apartheid activists have criticized Hendrickse for agreeing
to mixed-race participation in the white-dominated Parliament, even
though the black majority remains excluded. Hendrickse this year
also defied President P.W. Botha several times by pressing for the
abolition of legally-enforced residential segregation.
   In what one newspaper called ``a humiliating defeat,'' Botha's
National Party on Thursday withdrew proposed bills that would have
given authorities greater powers to confiscate property and evict
and prosecute people living in areas not designated for their race.
   On Aug. 24, a Wimpy hamburger restaurant in Standerton also was
damaged by a limpet mine blast. Police blamed that attack on the
African National Congress.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 5 million whites control the
economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health
services, giving the 26 million blacks no voice in national affairs.
   State-of-emergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict
reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of
detainees, some forms of protest, and a broad range of statements
the government considers subversive. Enforcement of the regulations
has not been comprehensive.

<HEAD>White Anti-Apartheid Leader Visits Mandela in Clinic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading anti-apartheid member
of Parliament brought books, chocolates and fruit on Friday to
jailed black leader Nelson Mandela at the clinic where he is
recovering from tuberculosis.
   The activist lawmaker, Helen Suzman, has met with the African
National Congress leader several times during his 26 years in
prison. After the visit, she described Mandela as ``very
optimistic, very moderate and easy-going.''
   ``We did not talk in depth on politics and we did not discuss
his possible release,'' she said.
   She added, however: ``I remain, as over many years, convinced
that Mr. Mandela is a reasonable man and that he will play a
valuable part in any negotiation proceedings.''
   Mandela, 70, was transferred Wednesday from a state hospital to
the Constantiaberg Clinic, a new and relatively luxurious private
hospital in a Cape Town suburb. Mandela was moved Aug. 12 from
Pollsmoor Prison to Tygerberg, where doctors said he made a good
recovery following drainage of fluid from his lungs.
   Mandela, the country's best-known black leader, is serving a
life sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white-led
government.
   Mrs. Suzman met with Mandela for about an hour. She took him
fruit, chocolates and a book by the late South African writer Alan
Paton. During the visit she made a quick trip to a shop to buy
candied fruit that Mandela requested.
   She said the visit was her first with Mandela in more than two
years and came about because of persistent requests to Justice
Minister Kobie Coetsee following Mandela's hospitalization.
   Coetsee met with Mandela on Thursday and said the prisoner's
health had improved considerably.
   A pro-government newspaper, The Citizen, Friday quoted
unidentified government sources as saying the move to the clinic
was a ``goodwill gesture'' which officials hoped would prompt a
conciliatory response from Mandela and make his release possible.
   Mandela's lawyer, Ismail Ayob, has said he does not view the
transfer as an indication the government has decided to free
Mandela.
   Government officials had suggested previously that Mandela would
be moved to a clinic, and possibly allowed an increased flow of
visitors, before a final decision was made whether to release him
outright. Thus far, prison officials have not eased Mandela's
visiting priveliges.
   Mandela's full recuperation is likely to take a few months.
After that period, the government could choose whether to send him
back to prison or grant him freedom.
   President P.W. Botha said two weeks ago he was seriously
considering releasing Mandela but indicated he wanted Mandela to
renounce violence.
   Mrs. Suzman, 71, entered Parliament in 1953 and is its
longest-serving member. Between 1961 and 1974, she was the only
Parliament member for the anti-apartheid Progressive Federal Party.

   Government officials and Mothers Against Drunk
Driving have asked motorists to drive with their headlights on
Saturday in a ``Drive for Life'' campaign to keep drinkers off the
roads.
   Leaders of MADD were joined at a news conference Friday by
Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley, other federal, state and
local officials and executives of Volkswagen United States Inc., to
promote the observance. The weekend activities include nationwide
television advertisements and various local events, such as
petition signings, to stiffen drunken driving laws.
   Congress and President Reagan have proclaimed the long Labor Day
weekend the National Drive for Life Weekend. Ordinarily, according
to MADD, the rate of fatal accidents caused by drunken driving
increases by 10 percent over the Labor Day period.
   Last year, 23,632 Americans were killed and 560,000 injured in
accidents attributed to drunken driving, according to MADD. On last
year's Drive for Life day, the fatality rate dropped 28 percent, it
said.
   The sponsors asked Americans to affirm a pledge to refrain from
drinking and driving by keeping their headlights burning Saturday.
   ``We must constantly remind the American people of these
statistics, and do all we can to mobilize them to stop the
carnage,'' said Burnley.

<HEAD>Thousands Take Shelter As Rains Trigger Fears of Deluge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people taking shelter from
rising floodwaters in Dhaka's streets and parks panicked Friday
when monsoon showers hit the city and triggered fears of a deluge.
   At least 120,000 people have fled homes in the countryside to
take shelter in Dhaka, a relief official said.
   ``There was great panic after the rain because for many there
was hardly any place to take cover,'' said the official, Abdur
Rashid.
   At least one-third of the country is flooded and newspapers say
758 people have died in house collapses, snake bites and drownings
since June, when the annual southwest monsoon hit the subcontinent.
The government says only 280 people have died, but its estimates
are considered low.
   More than half of Dhaka came under water after the adjacent
Buriganga River burst its banks. By Friday evening the river, a
tributary of the mighty Ganges, was about three inches above flood
level, its highest in 34 years.
   The government has set up 125 relief camps in the city and
ordered the closure of all schools and colleges to use the
buildings to house displaced people, Rashid said.
   Floodwaters are 6 feet deep at places, and some residents were
reported to be hoarding food.
   Dhaka's airport remained open for domestic flights, but
international airlines were advised to suspend operations for 24
hours. An airport official said up to 2 inches of water covered
parts of the complex.
   The Bengali-language Sangbad newspaper said Friday at least 10
more people died in the floods in the northern districts of
Mymnesingh and Munshiganj.
   The Ganges and the Brahmaputra rivers and their dozens of
tributaries flow from India and through Bangladesh to the Bay of
Bengal. The rivers flood almost every year after the monsoon
showers in Bangladesh and India.
   Flooding began in the northern districts about three weeks ago,
but areas to the south were affected recently as the waters swirled
downstream.
   International aid for flood victims has arrived in response to
an appeal from President Hussain Muhammad Ershad. The United States
has pledged $25,000 to help relief efforts and India sent four air
force helicopters to reach flood-affected areas.
   Bangladesh is one of the poorest countries in the world and its
109 million people earn a per capita income of about $150 per year.
   At least 1,500 people died in floods last year. In 1985, more
than 10,000 were killed when cyclones and tidal waves hit low-lying
islands in the Bay of Bengal, about 130 miles south of Dhaka.

<HEAD>Nevada's Hecht, Bryan Face Little Opposition In Senatorial
Primaries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDAN RILEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Chic Hecht and Gov. Dick Bryan,
who wants Hecht's job, both face opposition in their party
primaries Tuesday, but they are looking beyond their little-known
opponents to their expected general election battle.
   Hecht, a first-term Republican senator, and Bryan hardly ever
mention their primary opponents' names. Instead, they have
criticized each other repeatedly, with Hecht citing the governor's
strong labor support and Bryan charging Hecht with making false
statements and lacking credibility.
   Bryan's second term as governor is due to end in 1991. He is
barred by law from seeking a third consecutive term.
   A poll taken in August for the gaming industry shows Bryan with
a 14-point lead over Hecht. Hecht has stopped releasing his own
poll results but said he is closing the gap and considers the race
a toss-up.
   In the primary, the long-shot candidate trying to oust Hecht is
Larry Scheffler, 38, owner of a graphics business in Henderson.
When he filed for election, Scheffler said he would press for
reprocessing of high-level nuclear waste brought to Nevada so that
only low-level, less radioactive waste would remain.
   A high-level nuclear waste facility that the federal government
has proposed for south-central Nevada has drawn considerable
opposition.
   Bryan's opponents in the Democratic primary are Manford ``Cave
Rock Manny'' Beals, Patrick Fitzpatrick, and Larry Kepler.
   Beals, 54, who was at odds for years with officials about a
bar-restaurant and service station he once ran, has waged a
low-cost campaign by loudspeaker, driving down streets towing a
trailer with his trademark, a lifesize plastic gorilla named Rufus,
chained on top.
   Fitzpatrick, 60, veteran of four unsuccessful political
campaigns, is waging another low-budget campaign. He wants expanded
health care insurance.
   Kepler, 44, a Las Vegas consultant, opposes the high-level
nuclear dump in Nevada and wants no personal income taxes and more
help for the homeless.
   Three Republicans are vying for the chance to challenge Rep. Jim
Bilbray in the state's 1st Congressional District. Bilbray faces no
opposition in the Democratic primary, and in the state's 2nd
District, there is no primary race in either party.
   Lucille Lusk, 40, a longtime Republican activist, is viewed as
the favorite to win the 1st District GOP congressional nomination,
though polls put her well behind Bilbray for the general election.
The other two Republican hopefuls are Vietnam war hero James ``Bo''
Gritz, who has made headlines in recent years for his forays into
Southeast Asia looking for POWs, and political unknown John Kraft,
a retiree.
   In the state's 2nd Congressional District, Rep. Barbara
Vucanovich has no opponent in the Republican primary. She'll face
Sparks Mayor Jim Spoo, the only Democratic primary candidate, in
the general election.

   Young performers fought back tears after a
popular music teacher suffered a heart attack during a concert, but
they went on with the show.
   E. O'Hara Spearman, supervisor of the elite honors music program
for the St. Louis school district, had finished his saxophone solo
with the honors stage band when he collapsed Thursday during a
welcoming ceremony put on by the St. Louis public schools for their
staff.
   ``I saw him backing up at the end of the number,'' said Larry
Wilson, band director at Woerner School, who was in the audience.
``At first I thought he was just adjusting the sound. But then I
thought something was wrong.''
   Spearman, 60, was listed in critical but stable condition Friday
at St. Louis University Hospital, a hospital spokesman said.
   After Spearman collapsed, the curtain was closed and William A.
Pearson, associate superintendent, suggested continuation of the
show because Spearman ``would want it that way.''
   While Spearman was being treated behind the curtain, dance
students from Marquette Visual and Performing Arts Middle School
did a jazz tap dance out front. Then ballet students from the
Visual and Performing Arts High School took front stage.
   But backstage, faces were tear-stained.
   Superintendent Jerome Jones then stopped the program before he
was scheduled to give the traditional welcoming speech, saying it
seemed inappropriate for the show to continue.
   The program is an annual tradition on the teachers' first day
back. Classes begin Tuesday.
   Spearman is credited with rejuvenating the district's honors
music program. About 150 high school students from all over the
city are accepted by audition into the program each year.

<HEAD>Blood Center Chastised Over AIDS Tests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A blood center has been criticized by federal
officials for distributing 22 units of blood before completely
ensuring that they were not infected by the virus that causes AIDS,
the center's director says.
   Federal Drug Administration officials inspected the Belle
Bonfils Memorial Blood Center in July and said the center failed to
follow standard procedures by releasing blood that initially tested
positive for AIDS and hepatitis, said center director Dr. Robert
Chapman. Bonfils supplies blood to regional hospitals.
   The blood, which went to about 45 people, later tested negative
when new chemicals were used in followup tests, said Chapman.
   Blood center officials also retested all but two of the donors
of the blood, and all had negative test results for AIDS and
hepatitis, said Chapman.
   He said transfusion recipients were not contacted, because
officials are confident they were not infected.
   Chapman said the 22 blood units tested positive for the usually
fatal AIDS virus and hepatitis during one week in June.
``Ordinarily, we see maybe three to five test positive,'' he said.
   When any unit of blood tests positive, the center performs two
additional tests, said Chapman. If both followup tests are
negative, the blood is released. If one is positive, additional
tests are done and the blood may be discarded, said Chapman.
   The 22 units of blood in question did not pass both tests the
day after the initial tests read positive for AIDS and hepatitis.
But Chapman said laboratory technicians believed the tests were
defective and they released the blood.
   ``This was a really unusual number, and the lab felt something
was wrong with the test chemicals,'' the doctor said. ``New
chemicals were used the following week, and on retesting all those
units were negative'' for the diseases.
   ``Clearly this shows the tests were faulty,'' said Chapman.
``But ordinarily we would not use a unit when there is any
question. ... It's not the safest thing to do.''
   The center has instituted a policy requiring supervisors to
approve all units of blood that test positive for AIDS, said
Chapman. He said lab technicians had made those decisions
previously.

   Police fired tear gas into a bank and
rushed the building in search of two holdup men who locked four
employees in an office as they arrived for work, but the gunmen had
apparently fled hours earlier.
   ``It's ironic the way it worked out,'' said Officer Douglas R.
Anderson. ``We were here to play it out until the end. We don't
feel silly.''
   The two men, armed with a sawed-off shotgun and a knife, had
broken in through a back window of the Third National Bank branch
and were waiting inside when it opened about 8 a.m., the spokesman
said.
   They locked four employees in an office; a fifth worker about to
enter the building saw one of the men and summoned police, Anderson
said.
   The employees, three women and a man, ran outside about 11 a.m.,
three hours after the ordeal began. One of the women appeared to be
crying.
   Police then fired tear gas into building and searched it for two
men but concluded they fled before the building was surrounded,
Anderson said.
   It was not immediately known if the gunmen stole anything.
   Anderson said he didn't know how the people escaped from the
office or whether they realized at that point that the gunmen had
apparently gone.
   The hostages were taken to a police station for further
interviews, police said.

   The West Bank's top army commander chastised
Jewish settlers Friday for being too quick to use their weapons
after one settler accidentally wounded two soldiers.
   Palestinians and soldiers fought in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip, and hospital officials said 10 Palestinians were
injured.
   Brig. Gen. Amram Mitzna warned the settlers in a 90-minute
closed-door meeting to obey army regulations on the firing of
weapons, Israel radio reported.
   Settler leaders contended Gedalia Becker was obeying army policy
when he opened fire Wednesday after a Palestinian demonstrator
threw a firebomb at his car on a West Bank road south of Bethlehem.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin recently gave Israeli soldiers
and civilians permission to shoot at firebomb throwers. But Mitzna
told the settlers they could open fire only to extricate themselves
from immediate danger, the Itim news agency said.
   Becker, a U.S. immigrant, was quoted as saying he acted on
instinct honed during service with the American army in Vietnam as
a combat helicopter pilot.
   ``In Vietnam I walked around with two pistols and a carbine.
Whoever thought twice in Vietnam died instantly. Whoever fired
survived,'' the Israeli Davar daily quoted him as saying.
   Police released Becker on bail Thursday after he was questioned
about the shooting.
   The gasoline bottle missed Becker's car and exploded on the road
behind it. Becker ran out of the car and opened fire at two figures
he spotted nearby, accidentally wounding two soldiers who were
chasing the assailant.
   Since Palestinians began an uprising against Israeli rule in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip on Dec. 8, 258 Palestinians have been
killed, most by Israeli gunfire. Four Israelis also have died.
Israel captured the territories in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Palestinians fought soldiers in three towns and refugee camps in
the occupied lands.
   Two Palestinians aged 17 and 18 were wounded by gunfire in a
Gaza Strip refugee camp after troops opened fire on stone-throwing
protesters, said an official at Shifa Hospital in Gaza City.
   Five other Palestinians, including two pregnant women and an
18-month-old child, were treated for tear gas inhalation after the
clash, said officials in Ahli Hospital in Gaza.
   A sixth victim was treated for a two-inch cut in his forehead
caused by the impact of a tear gas canister, the official said.
   The army confirmed one Palestinian was hit by a plastic bullet
in the camp after troops fired weapons in response to stonings by
protesters. The military had no other reports of injuries.
   Two other Palestinians were wounded in clashes in and near the
West Bank's largest city, Nablus.
   Ghasan Mustafa Ahmad Abed, 16, of Azzun village near Nablus,
suffered a gunshot wound in the right buttock, said an official at
Al Ittihad Hospital.
   Jihad Hamdam Badawi El Zara, 27, was hit by four bullet
fragments in the right leg during a separate clash, the official
said on condition of anonymity.
   Also Friday, the Supreme Court rejected an appeal by a sentry
who was sentenced to 18 months in jail for failing to prevent an
attack by a Palestinian guerrilla who rode a hang glider into
Israel and killed six soldiers in November.
   The Ministry of Education announced that Arabic would be a
compulsory subject for all Israeli junior high and high school
students this year.
   The Itim news agency said the requirement would fulfill the
army's need for Arabic speakers in the occupied territories.
   A Tel Aviv district court convicted two Israelis of plotting to
murder Arab workers in the nearby suburb of Or Yehuda, Israel radio
said.
   Benjamin Saada, 31, and Yaacov Batash, 21, were charged with
making firebombs out of beer bottles and planning to throw them at
a shack where Arab workers were sleeping on Aug 21. But they
panicked and hurled them into an Israeli backyard instead, the
radio said.
   Earlier in August, three Arabs were killed in an arson attack on
a shack where they were sleeping in Or Yehuda. The attack on the
Israeli backyard had been blamed on Arabs seeking revenge for the
burning deaths.
   Two other Israelis have been arrested in the Or Yehuda deaths.

   Two brothers in the Irish
Republican Army, killed with a third man in a British army ambush,
were buried at their home village Friday in a peaceful ceremony
watched by 500 riot police.
   Before dawn, police in Belfast fired plastic bullets to disperse
rioters during a third night of violence in Roman Catholic areas.
No injuries were reported.
   The Rev. Peter Taggart, the Roman Catholic priest who conducted
the funeral Mass, spoke of ``disturbing questions'' about British
tactics in killing Gerard and Martin Harte, aged 29 and 21, and
Brian Mullin, 26.
   Police with riot shields and clubs swamped the tiny village 45
miles west of Belfast and flanked the cortege route, making the
country lane so narrow some mourners could barely squeeze through.
   Police said the Hartes and Mullin were well-known IRA men who
were armed and dressed for a violent mission when bullets riddled
their car Tuesday. Press reports said they were on their way to
kill an off-duty soldier.
   Mullin, who was Martin Harte's brother-in-law, will be buried
Saturday in nearby Dunmoyle.
   IRA supporters say the men could have been given a chance to
surrender. The government of the Irish Republic, although it also
has outlawed the IRA, expressed concern and the killings were
discussed at a Cabinet meeting Friday.
   Taggart told the congregation in St. Mary's Church the sanctity
of human life ``is binding on everyone, not just an ordinary
citizen but also on the government and those charged with the
administration of the law.''
   ``Some disturbing questions have been raised about the
circumstances in which these young men died,'' he said. ``It is
necessary to point out that the law of the land must obey the moral
law.''
   Authorities in the Protestant-dominated province appeared
determined to prevent the IRA from making the funeral a show of
anti-British strength. No incidents were reported and no guerrilla
paraphernalia was evident, apart from a beret and pair of gloves on
each coffin.
   An IRA statement distributed to news media said it had honored
the slain comrades Thursday night by firing a volley in the
Loughmacrory area.
   Black flags flew from all the telephone poles in the village and
``IRA the voice of an oppressed people'' was daubed on a wall.
   A military helicopter hovered low as the coffins, draped in
Irish flags, reached the graveyard. Its clatter nearly drowned the
eulogy delivered by Gerry Adams, president of the IRA's legal
political wing, Sinn Fein.
   Police say Gerard Harte commanded the mid-Tyrone IRA unit and
Martin Harte was responsible for choosing targets among police and
members of the locally recruited Ulster Defense Regiment.
   The IRA is fighting to drive the British from Northern Ireland
and unite it with the Irish Republic, which is 95 percent Catholic.
   It acknowledged the three men as members and said they died ``on
active service,'' by which it means during an operation, but has
given no details of the mission.
   So far this year, the IRA has lost 11 members and has killed 27
British soldiers, including eight with a bomb that blew up their
bus Aug. 20 not far from Loughmacrory.
   Britain responded to the increased attacks by saying new
measures would be taken, and the ambush was seen as the beginning
of a crackdown.
   Military officials also have adopted tighter security.
   Organizers of Sport Aid, a worldwide charity run scheduled for
Sept. 11, said the army withdrawn from an event in London's Hyde
Park, and the Defense Ministry explained: ``In the current security
climate, regretfully the army cannot participate.''
   Six British soldiers were killed June 15 by a bomb planted in
their van while they participated in a charity run in Northern
Ireland.

   A U.S. Army private and her
9-year-old son are the only Americans identified among the 49
killed when a jet crashed into the crowd at a U.S. base air show,
officials said Friday.
   More than 600 people attended three private memorial services
for the victims, who died after the jet collided with two other
fighter jets of the Italian air force precision flying team,
crashed and exploded.
   Two of the 49 killed Sunday at Ramstein Air Base remained
unidentified, according to police in nearby Kaiserslautern.
Fourteen children are among the 172 people still hospitalized,
officials said.
   But base spokeswoman Maj. Kathy White said three people remain
unidentified. There was no immediate explanation for the
discrepancy.
   She said the identified dead are 39 West Germans, the three
Italian pilots, the two Americans and one each from France and the
Netherlands.
   ``No more Americans have died that we know of,'' she said.
Earlier, officials said they believed six Americans were killed.
   Kaiserslautern police said 40 West Germans were among the dead.
One of the dead was a pregnant woman, said a police official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Air Force officials identified the two Americans as Joshua
Frymyer and his mother, 36-year-old Army Pfc. Genevieve Riggs, who
was stationed in West Germany.
   Mrs. Riggs' husband, Army Sgt. Myron Riggs, was among seven
people evacuated to the United States this week for treatment of
burn injuries.
   Ms. White said the bodies of the mother and son were flown back
to the United States, but she did not know where they were being
taken.
   Juergen Dietzen, spokesman for Rhineland-Palatinate state where
Ramstein is located, said 14 children under age 14 are among the
172 people still hospitalized.
   He also said that 10 to 12 of the hospitalized victims were in
``life-threatening condition,'' but did not say if children were
among them.
   The unofficial U.S. Armed Forces newspaper Stars and Stripes
told of anguish and grieving as more than 600 people attended three
private memorial services Thursday night at Ramstein and in
Kaiserslautern.
   ``As a call went out for a moment of silent prayer heads bowed,
some shook as if in disbelief, some quivered from crying,'' the
newspaper said of one of the services.
   West Germans and Americans, including U.S. Air Force Europe
Commander Gen. William Kirk, attended the services, the paper said.
   It quoted Chaplain Col. Larry Kelly as saying at one service:
``We must rid ourselves of feeling guilty that we live while they
died. To survive such ... spiritual pain, we must cry, whether
privately or publicly, and vent our anger that our loved ones have
been taken from ourselves forever.''
   A public memorial service is set for Saturday at a church in
Ramstein. Top West German leaders and U.S. Ambassador Richard Burt
are scheduled to attend.
   In other developments:
   _ The Defense Ministry in Bonn said that on the same day as
Sunday's tragedy, West German air force officers went ahead with a
party after an air exhibition at another site in West Germany even
though they had been informed of what happened at Ramstein. Defense
Ministry spokesman Winfried Dunkel said the officers could face
disciplinary action.
   _ Werver Overbeck, chief surgeon at Kaiserslautern hospital,
angrily rejected allegations that victims with serious burns were
not taken to special treatment centers. ``Injured patients that
weren't treated in special burn centers had other kinds of injuries
such as broken bones, or they had burns that did not need to be
treated in special clinics,'' Overbeck said.

   The leader of a polygamist clan was
sentenced to 15 years in prison today for bombing a Mormon chapel
and firing at federal agents during a 13-day standoff that ended
with the slaying of a corrections officer.
   Addam Swapp, 27, the first of four clan members to be sentenced
today by U.S. District Judge Bruce Jenkins, could have received 75
years in prison but instead was given the minimum allowed by law,
said his lawyer, John Bucher.
   Swapp's mother-in-law, clan matriarch Vickie Singer, 45, was
sentenced to five years in prison, also the minimum, for her role
in the bombing and standoff. She could have received up to 50 years.
   Swapp; Mrs. Singer; her son, John Timothy Singer; and Swapp's
brother, Jonathan, were convicted in May in the Jan. 16 bombing and
the subsequent standoff with 100 federal and state law officers.
   The stalemate at the clan's Marion farm ended in a shootout that
killed state Corrections Lt. Fred House. Assistant Attorney General
Creighton Horton said murder charges in House's death probably will
be filed Tuesday.
   Swapp admitted at trial that he bombed the Kamas Stake Center,
saying it was ordered by God as a sign of the impending collapse of
church, state and nation.
   He said the bombing also was intended to draw attention to the
1979 slaying of polygamist John Singer, Mrs. Singer's husband and
father of Swapp's wives.
   The family contends Singer was murdered in a ``church-state
conspiracy'' that began with his refusal to send his children to
public schools.
   Jenkins today told Swapp he was being sent to prison ``not for
what you say, not for what you believe _ for what you did.''
   ``There's no case I know of that more clearly shows the wisdom
of Congress in imposing minimum sentences than this one,'' said
U.S. Attorney Brent Ward, who said the government may file an
appeal for harsher penalties.
   The Swapp brothers and John Timothy Singer were found guilty of
attempted murder of FBI agents, resisting and assaulting agents and
firearms counts. Addam Swapp also was found guilty of explosives
offenses and damaging the church.
   Mrs. Singer was convicted of weapons and explosives charges and
assaulting and resisting agents.

<HEAD>Toxic Waste Ship to Return to Italy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A West German freighter carrying 2,100 tons of toxic
wastes will unload its cargo in Italy, government officials said
Friday.
   The ship, the Karin B, was denied permission to dock in Spain,
Britain, France, West Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. The
wastes originally were shipped from Italy and dumped illegally in
Nigeria.
   Environment Minister Giorgio Ruffolo and Civil Defense Minister
Vito Lattanzio said after a Cabinet meeting that the wastes
probably will be unloaded at an unspecified Italian military port.
The ship is anchored in international waters off the coast of
France.
   The wastes may have come from as many as 10 European countries,
but they were shipped from Italy. Nigeria's military government
seized an Italian ship, the Piave, last July to bolster its demand
that Italy remove the wastes.
   The Karin B was the first of two ships sent to pick up the
wastes. It sailed from Nigeria on July 30. The second ship, The
Deep Sea Carrier, sailed from Nigeria on Aug. 15 and reportedly is
steaming off the coast of Portugal.
   The Cabinet announcement did not mention the second ship.
   Officials have said they don't know the precise chemical content
of the cargo. But on Wednesday, Robert Smeraldi, a spokesman for
the environmental group Friends of the Earth, said its lab
technicians in Nigeria found the drums contained PCBs and were
highly flammable.
   PCBs, or polycholorinated biphenyls, can cause cancer and burns
on contact.
   The plight of the Karin B is similar to that of the Zanoobia,
the Syrian freighter that was Italy's first so-called ship of
poison.
   It wandered the Mediterranean for four months with a cargo that
had once been dumped illegally in Venezuela. That ship was finally
given permission in June to unload its 12,000 drums of industrial
waste in Genoa.

   The first big radio telescope array
in the Southern Hemisphere began operating Friday, opening a new
window on the little-explored southern sky.
   ``We'll be looking at the center of our galaxy because it passes
right above our head in the Southern Hemisphere,'' said Dr. Ron
Ekers, the director of the instrument named the Australia
Telescope. ``Much of the galaxy and the nearest neighboring galaxy,
the Magellanic Cloud is not visible to observatories in the
Northern Hemisphere.''
   Ekers, who for seven years was director of the 27-dish, Very
Large Array radio telescope in western New Mexico, said the
telescope will study black holes and pulsars.
   The new $40 million instrument located on the windswept plains
of western New South Wales, consists of five new 72.6-foot dishes
mounted on 1.86 miles of railroad track.
   An identical dish on a track 1.86 miles away will make the array
equivalent to one dish with a diameter 3.72 miles.
   When linked to the exisiting 211-foot-dish at Parkes 241 miles
to the south and others spread across the continent, the Australia
Telescope can be extended like a zoom lens on a camera, to the
equivalent of a dish 2,400 miles in diameter.
   The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Organization, the
government- funded research institution that designed the
telescope, said the compact array of seven telescopes had an
equivalent resolution to being able to read a telephone directory
at a distance of 660 feet.
   When linked to telescopes in space, it would be 10,000 times
greater.
   ``The Australia Telescope is the state of the art in
astronomical technology, it is one of the best telescopes in the
world,'' Prime Minister Bob Hawke told an audience of astronomers
and scientists at the inaugural ceremony.
   Harry Van der Laan, head of the European Southern Observatory in
Chile, said: ``If Australia hadn't built it, the European Southern
Observatory would have had to do it in Chile.''
   ``We have the biggest optical telescopes in the Southern
Hemisphere at La Silla in Chile, but we had no major radio
telescope array. World astronomy cannot do without it,'' he said.
   ``This fills that gap and it puts Australia back in the top
league of astronomy. Its the equivalent of winning the America's
Cup in yachting,'' Van der Laan said.

   Emperor Hirohito took the unusual step Friday of
assuring reporters that he was in good health following a fever
earlier in the week that kept him in bed for two days.
   But Japanese reporters who attended the five-minute meeting with
the world's longest reigning monarch said he looked frail and his
cheeks were hollow.
   Hirohito, 87, underwent an intestinal bypass operation a year
ago, and since then has limited his official duties.
   ``I'm completely recovered, so please don't worry,'' the
newspaper Asahi Shimbun quoted him as telling reporters at the
imperial villa in Nasu, northeast of Tokyo, where he has been
vacationing with Empress Nagako.
   The emperor remained in bed Monday and Tuesday with a cold and
fever of about 99.5 degrees, an Imperial Household Agency official
said.
   ``He seems to be in good condition now,'' the official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In a rare negative description of the emperor's health by the
Japanese mass media, Kyodo News Service said he looked frail, his
shoulders were sloping and he spoke in a weak voice.

<HEAD>Jobless Rate Increases to 5.6 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unemployment climbed to 5.6 percent in August
as the number of jobless Americans grew by 226,000 and a four-month
hiring boom in the nation's factories ended abruptly, the
government said Friday.
   Stock and bond prices soared on the news, and analysts said the
softening job market was just the ``cold shower'' than an
overheating economy needed. They predicted it will keep a lid on
inflation and interest rates through the November elections.
   The 0.2 percentage point rise from July's unemployment rate of
5.4 percent was characterized by 5,000 layoffs in a manufacturing
sector that had put 130,000 more workers on their assembly lines in
the previous three months in response to surging foreign demand for
U.S. exports.
   Last month, when factories reported adding 70,000 workers in
July despite a slight increase in joblessness from a 14-year-low
5.3 percent in June, the Federal Reserve Board applied the brakes
to the economy, raising interest rates one-half percentage point.
   ``This is a case where bad news is good news for an economy that
was running hell-bent toward overheating and creating a very
worrisome inflationary environment,'' Allen Sinai of The Boston
Co., a New York economic consulting firm, said of the August jobs
report. ``A little cold shower here was exactly what was needed.''
   Richard Rahn, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's chief economist and
a frequent critic of the Federal Reserve's monetary policies, said
the unemployment figures show that the board ``has achieved its
goal of slowing the economy.''
   ``They now should reduce interest rates to avoid killing the
expansion,'' he said.
   Most other analysts said they doubt that will happen, but they
agreed there is now little likelihood that interest rates will be
raised again before the election.
   A separate survey of business payrolls showed employers adding
219,000 new jobs in August, compared with average monthly gains of
more than 325,000 the previous three months.
   Larry Chimerine of the WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., economic
consulting firm, said the smaller payroll growth is consistent with
an economy that is still expanding, but at a slower pace.
   ``Clearly this will delay further tightening by the Fed,'' he
said. ``They won't reverse what they did last month but they can
now afford to take a wait-and-see attitude. Clearly there is no
evidence of a wage-price spiral. The inflation we are getting is
limited primarily to commodity prices, imports and food, and at
this point does not threat to become much more widespread.''
   ``This is another stroke of (President) Reagan's luck, a
one-month cooling down when inflation pressures were building
rapidly in a too steamy economy,'' Sinai said. ``There are two more
unemployment reports between now and the election, but if the rate
stays between 5.4 percent and 5.8 percent, it can only be described
as a major accomplishment.''
   Despite the increase in the unemployment rate, the Labor
Department said a record 62.3 percent of the working-age population
16 and over held jobs in August.
   Campaigning in New Jersey, Republican presidential nominee
George Bush called the rise in the jobless rate ``statistically
almost irrelevant. The total work force has been expanding ... it's
very encouraging,'' he said.
   Susan Estrich, campaign manager for Democratic nominee Michael
Dukakis, called the loss of 5,000 manufacturing jobs and the
failure of wages to rise above their $9.31 hourly average in July
``blows to hopes for prosperity in the nation's heartland (and)
easing the squeeze on working Americans.''
   Wages have risen an average of only 3.1 percent over the past 12
months, decreasing the buying power of workers by one-half percent
after taking inflation into account.
   The Labor Department said most of the 226,000 increase in
joblessness to 6,851,000 people in August occurred among adult men,
whose unemployment rate rose 0.4 percentage points to 4.9 percent.
   The unemployment rate also rose among teen-agers, from 15.2
percent to 15.8 percent, but fell from 5.1 percent to 4.8 percent
for women and from 11.4 percent to 11.3 percent among blacks.
   Small employment gains in printing and publishing and
export-related industries such as machinery and electrical
equipment were more than offset by 9,000 job losses in textile and
apparel plants and smaller declines in several other manufacturing
industries.
   On the services side of the economy, large monthly increases in
retail trade hiring _ 80,000 in July alone _ slowed to just 23,000
new jobs last month, virtually all of them in grocery stores.
   Other recent high-growth job areas also slackened. Business
services such as temporary help firms added just 16,000 new
workers, compared with average monthly increases of 30,000 in June
and July.
   New employment in health services, which the government predicts
will be the largest area of job growth in the 1990s as the Baby
Boom population ages, slowed to 22,000 in August from its
30,000-a-month average in the past year.
   Janet L. Norwood, commissioner of labor statistics, said one
encouraging sign was that the number of people working part-time
because they could not find full-time jobs ``returned to the bottom
of the 5.2 million-to-5.6 million range within which it has been
fluctuating for more than a year.''
   Other data in the report, however, suggested the economy might
be slowing. The average work week declined by 20 minutes to 34.6
hours and manufacturing overtime fell by 0.1 hours to 3.8 hours a
week on average.
   A separate calculation that includes the 1.7 million active-duty
military personnel stationed in the United States showed a jobless
rate of 5.5 percent last month, up from 5.4 percent in July.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is looking
forward to having a longtime wish come true: She's to become a
grandmother next spring.
   A spokesman at Thatcher's 10 Downing St. office announced Friday
that the prime minister's son Mark and his Texan wife, Diane, broke
the news this week that they are going to have their first baby.
   The spokesman said Mrs. Thatcher and her husband, Denis, ``are
delighted and quite thrilled.'' The prime minister, 62, has often
said in interviews that she longs to become a grandmother.
   Mark Thatcher, a 35-year-old auto executive and onetime racing
driver, married 27-year-old Diane Burgdorf, daughter of Dallas
millionaire auto dealer Ted Burgdorf, in London on Feb. 14, 1987.
They live in Dallas.
   The prime minister's other child, Mark's twin sister Carol, a

   Ernest Olson took on the ``A-Team'' and
lost.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday upheld a
judge's ruling that NBC had not copied the action-adventure series
from an Olson screenplay called ``Cargo.''
   Olson's script involved three Vietnam veterans who had conducted
scams during the war and were looking to continue them in civilian
life over the opposition of their former superior officers, who had
become corrupt drug agents.
   ``The A-Team'' involved the adventures of four Vietnam vets,
three of whom were unjustly court-martialed in Vietnam, escaped
from prison and were on the run. Its stars included Mr. T and
George Peppard.
   A federal jury in Los Angeles found that the series was
substantially similar to ``Cargo'' and that NBC had access to
Olson's work before putting on ``The A-Team.'' But the judge
overruled the jury, finding no substantial similarity.
   In a 3-0 decision, the appeals court said the similarities fell
far short of the evidence needed for copyright infringement.

   Michael Dukakis welcomed former top aide John
Sasso back to his presidential campaign Friday, nearly a year after
Dukakis declared that Sasso ``will not be back'' because of his
role in torpedoing Sen. Joseph Biden's bid for the Democratic
nomination.
   The return of Sasso as campaign vice chairman, announced jointly
by Dukakis in California and his senior advisers in Boston, was
widely seen as another signal that the Democratic nominee has
decided to mount a more aggressive campaign at a time when
Republican George Bush has pulled even in most polls.
   ``Almost a year ago, John Sasso made a very serious mistake,''
Dukakis reporters. ``He's paid the price.''
   Dukakis said he was rehiring his longtime political alter-ego
because he wanted to assemble ``the strongest team I possibly can''
for the final two months of the campaign.
   Dukakis said Sasso's return had nothing to do with his recent
decline in the polls.
   ``It's simply the fact we're looking at a little more than two
months of what is going to be a very tough, very competitive
campaign,'' Dukakis said. ``It's going to be a battle royal for the
presidency of the United States.''
   Bush chief of staff Craig Fuller said the rehiring of Sasso
``speaks for itself.'' GOP vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle,
campaigning in Alabama, said it was ``another sign that the Dukakis
campaign is in serious trouble.''
   Dukakis said Sasso's involvement in the Biden incident ``should
not obscure a long and well-deserved reputation for character and
for integrity.''
   In Boston, Sasso received a thunderous ovation from Dukakis
campaign and state government loyalists when he walked into a news
conference with campaign chairman Paul Brountas and Sasso's
replacement as campaign manager, Susan Estrich.
   Sasso directed Dukakis' gubernatorial comeback in 1982, served
as statehouse chief of staff and was architect of the nominee's
presidential campaign. He resigned in September 1987 admitting that
he circulated a videotape showing Biden using a British
politician's rhetoric without attribution.
   News accounts about that incident and charges of plagiarism
forced Biden to withdraw from the Democratic presidential contest.
   At first, Dukakis denied that his campaign staff was responsible
for the videotapes, but he later acknowledged that Sasso was behind
them. Sasso and political director Paul Tully, who helped Sasso
prepare the tapes, then resigned.
   ``What I did back on September was an error in judgment and I am
sorry that it hurt Sen. Biden and his family,'' Sasso said Friday.
   Sasso and Dukakis both spoke to Biden earlier Friday before his
return to the campaign was announced, aides said. Dukakis said
Biden ``could not have been more gracious.''
   Sasso dismissed suggestions that his return would give the Bush
campaign an excuse to accuse Dukakis of planning a ``sleaze''
campaign. That would be ``outrageous'' of the Bush people, he said.
``They certainly have a problem along those lines.''
   Although he apologized to Biden, Sasso said there was nothing
``unethical or illegal'' about distributing accurate videotapes
showing the similarity of speeches by Biden and British Labor Party
leader Neil Kinnock.
   Biden issued a statement saying he was glad Sasso had agreed
that the Delaware senator ``never meant to mislead anyone.'' Biden
said he still supports Dukakis for president.
   ``There are contrasts and weaknesses that are issues in this
campaign,'' said Sasso, who will take a leave of absence from his
job with an advertising firm. ``I will not shy away from pointing
those contrasts out.''
   That promise drew applause from campaign workers who have
complained that Dukakis and his top aides had not counter-attacked
vigorously enough when Bush misprepresented Dukakis' record.
   If nothing else, Sasso's return energized a campaign staff that
has been sobered in recent weeks by Bush's surge in the polls. Many
believe that Dukakis' failure to respond to the Republican
nominee's salvos has cost the Massachusetts governor the momentum _
and the lead in the polls _ that he took from the Democratic
National Convention.
   Sasso said spoke to Dukakis on Tuesday and was asked if he would
return. ``I said if he thought I could help, of course I'd do it,''
Sasso said.
   ``Now we've got all of our best players on the field,'' said
Dukakis issues adviser Thomas Herman.
   Brountas said he, Estrich and Sasso would report directly to
Dukakis and that other campaign staff would continue to report to
Estrich.
   Campaign aides insisted that the decision to rehire Sasso was
not a sign of dissatisfaction with Estrich's performance, although
several said her role in campaign strategy likely would be reduced
somewhat.
   She put the best light on the announcement.
   ``Today, a family is reunited,'' she said, introducing Sasso to
reporters. ``There's nothing more special, nothing more satisfying,
than reaching out to family. And to me, John Sasso is family.''
   Brountas said Sasso would bring ``additional strength, important
political insight and wisdom to a very strong campaign team.''

   Two tremors were recorded Friday at a
seismic station here, aftershocks from a deadly earthquake last
month which killed more than 1,000 people in Nepal and India,
seismologists said.
   No damage or injuries were reported in the latest temblors.
   Seismologists said a tremor registering 4.8 on the Richter scale
occured at 3:45 a.m. and another, registering 5 on the Richter
scale, took place at 12:20 p.m.
   The epicentre of the tremors was in Udayapur, 35 miles north of
the India-Nepal border, the seismologists said.
   The Richter scale measures the engery released by an earthquake
according to the ground motion as recorded by seismographs. A
reading of 6 means the earthquake can cause severe damage and a
reading of 7 indicates a major earthquake.
   The earthquake Aug. 21 registered 6.5 on the Richter scale.

<TEXT>
   School officials in a small southwestern
Missouri town need more guidance before they can respond to a
federal order striking down their ban on school-sponsored dancing,
according to their attorney.
   U.S. District Judge Russell Clark ruled last month that the ban
on dancing at Purdy High School was unconstitutional because it
promoted the values of those who oppose dancing for religious
reasons.
   The judge said it was not his role to order the district to hold
dances, but he said the district could not enforce a no-dance rule
that some believe to be a century old.
   ``Defendants respectfully submit that they do not understand
what the court is ordering them to do or refrain from doing,''
wrote school district attorney Ransom Ellis III in a brief filed
Thursday.
   But lawyer William Fleischaker, representing the 21 young people
and parents who challenged the ban, said ``there's no question in
my mind'' about the order.
   ``Any efforts by the school district to unreasonably prevent the
students from having a dance would be in contempt of that order,''
Fleischaker said.
   Fleischaker said Ellis' request for a clarification was
``typical of what's gone on all along here _ the school district
has abandoned responsibility. They said, `We can't allow dancing
because of the rule.' Now they're saying, `We don't know what we
have to do. Judge, you tell us what we have to do.' They've run for
school board, let them use some responsibility.''
   The Purdy school system, centered in a town of about 900 people
50 miles southwest of Springfield, has about 520 pupils.
   Clark did not address Ellis' arguments at a hearing Friday,
during which the judge considered the amount of attorney fees to be
awarded the pro-dance lawyers. The judge said he would make his
final ruling in the case by the end of next week.

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Engineer's Suits Against Morton Thiokol</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MIMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former engineer's $3 billion lawsuits
against rocket-maker Morton Thiokol, stemming from his warnings
against launching the ill-fated Challenger space shuttle mission,
were dismissed Friday by a judge.
   U.S. District Judge David K. Winder's decision came after more
than six months of deliberations on Morton Thiokol's motions to
dismiss the suits filed by Roger Boisjoly.
   Telephone calls to Boisjoly's Willard residence were answered by
a recording. He did not return messages.
   His attorney, Robert Levin, said from his office in Washington,
D.C., that a decision had not been made on whether to appeal
Winder's ruling to the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver.
   ``I obviously wish it was better news than we got,'' Levin said.
``(But) I haven't seen it yet, and I obviously can't comment on a
ruling I haven't seen.''
   Morton Thiokol officials were elated, said company spokesman Ed
Snow.
   ``The dismissal of these two suits completely vindicates Morton
Thiokol. We are very happy to have this situation behind us,'' he
said.
   In one of his suits, Boisjoly sought $1 billion for the deaths
of the seven astronauts killed when Challenger exploded on Jan. 28,
1986, and $1 million in compensatory damages for Boisjoly's own
health and career.
   Boisjoly _ who left Morton Thiokol in July 1986 citing physical
ailments and alleged mental torment _ claimed the aerospace company
impugned his professional reputation after he and other engineers
told a presidential commission investigating the disaster that they
had warned against the launch.
   The Rogers Commission found that a faulty seal in a joint in a
solid fuel booster rocket made by Morton Thiokol was to blame for
the explosion.
   Boisjoly and several other Morton Thiokol engineers had argued
the night before the launch that temperatures of 53 degrees below
Fahrenheit or less could result in failure of the seal.
   His other lawsuit, filed under the False Claims Act on behalf of
U.S. taxpayers, sought $2.075 billion and alleged that Morton
Thiokol knowingly provided NASA with defective rocket motors.
   But Winder ruled that ``the `conspiracy' alleged in the
complaint is not of a nature to support an action for damages on
the part of Boisjoly .... neither the conspiracy itself nor the
overt acts allegedly done in furtherance of it were directed toward
Boisjoly.''
   Boisjoly also alleged that Morton Thiokol's setting aside of his
recommendation against launching Challenger _ and, after the
accident, alleged attempts by the company to discredit him,
threaten his employment and its action removing him from the
disaster investigation _ left him ``severely injured in his
emotional and mental health.''
   Company lawyers argued that Boisjoly, who this year won the
Scientific Freedom and Responsibility Award from the American
Association for Advancement of Science, had based his contention
that he was defamed on office chatter.
   But Levin accused company officials of launching a deliberate
campaign to defame Boisjoly through pamphlets and interviews, ``not
coffee-shop stuff.''
   Winder dismissed most counts in Boisjoly's suits with prejudice,
meaning they cannot be refiled. However, he said he dismissed two
counts of Boisjoly's first civil suit, which deal with allegations
of defamation and conspiracy, without prejudice ``by agreement of
the parties.''

   Two people were convicted in what authorities
called the largest baggage-theft ring ever discovered at O'Hare
International Airport.
   The Rev. Freddie Mitchell, 37, a pastor at Holy Raiders Revival
Church, and Delores Harris, 35, both of Chicago, were convicted
Thursday by a Cook County Criminal Court jury.
   Police recovered nearly 100 pieces of luggage and clothing,
valued at $100,000, at Lois' Resale Shop, a second-hand store owned
by the two defendants, said Jean Bischoff, assistant state's
attorney. Some of the luggage had airline tags still attached.
   Ms. Bischoff, who helped prosecute the case, said a third
suspect, Lorry Nelson, identified Lois' as the shop where she had
sold stolen luggage. Ms. Nelson was arrested at O'Hare last Oct. 20.
   An undercover officer, posing as Ms. Nelson's cousin,
accompanied her to the store and saw Ms. Harris buying two
suitcases from Ms. Nelson for $35 each, Ms. Bischoff said. Before
completing the deal, Ms. Harris called Mitchell to agree on the
price, she said.
   Ms. Nelson, 27, pleaded guilty earlier to theft and was
sentenced to five months in jail and 18 months of probation.

<HEAD>Feuding Black Groups Sign Accord</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival black political groups
signed an accord Friday to end what has been called the country's
worst factional fighting this century in which more than 600 people
have been killed in 20 months.
   An explosion rocked downtown Durban just after the evening rush
hour, causing extensive damage to a clothing store and slightly
injuring a black woman, police said.
   In other cities, a hand grenade was tossed at the home of South
Africa's leading mixed-race politician, and a bomb exploded in a
post office. No injuries were reported in either attack.
   The agreement signed Friday sought to halt savage fighting in
the Natal province between supporters of militant anti-apartheid
organizations and members of Inkatha, a more conservative group
headed by Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
   It was signed at a courthouse in the provincial capital,
Pietermaritzburg, by Inkatha's secretary-general Oscar Dhlomo and
by Jay Naidoo, secretary- general of the militant Congress of South
African Trade Unions.
   The labor federation has been allied with the United Democratic
Front, a now-banned anti-apartheid coalition, in the feud against
Inkatha.
   The agreement condemns violence and establishes an adjudication
board to review complaints of harassment or attacks. The board's
members would be selected jointly by the two sides and would have
disciplinary powers.
   ``Each party recognizes the immediate necessity to make it
abundantly clear to its members that COSATU and Inkatha
categorically condemn acts of intimidation, forced recruitment and
violence,'' the agreement says. ``All political organizations have
the right to exist and the democratic right to espouse their own
particular viewpoint.''
   Nicholas Haysom, a lawyer for the labor federation who helped
draft the accord, said both sides were cautious about their ability
to convince rank-and-file supporters to honor the pact.
   ``The level of retribution and atrocious violence has made
conditions almost impossible to exercise freedom of association,''
he said.
   Haysom said the adjudication board will be able to judge cases
far more quickly than the courts can and will seek to gain the
confidence of witnesses who have been fearful of making statements
to police.
   Supreme Court Justice N.S. Page, who had asked the two sides to
pursue an accord, said the courts were not abdicating their
responsibilities but viewed the new board as a valuable additional
tool to help stop the bloodshed.
   Most of the fighting has been in black townships around
Pietermaritzburg, although it has spread in recent months to
townships near the larger port city of Durban. Many of the killings
have been to avenge earlier killings.
   Both Inkatha, which claims 1.5 million members, and the United
Democratic Front-labor federation alliance oppose the apartheid
policies which enable 5 million whites to dominate 26 million
blacks. But their strategies differ markedly.
   The United Democratic Front, a predominantly black coalition of
some 600 groups, advocates economic sanctions, strikes, and other
confrontational measures to bring about sweeping political and
economic change.
   Inkatha opposes sanctions, avoids militant protest and advocates
capitalism.
   Many militants view Buthelezi as a government collaborator
because he is chief minister of the KwaZulu homeland. However,
Buthelezi has rejected invitations by the government to join in
negotiating reforms that would expand blacks' political role while
leaving whites in ultimate control.
   Peter Kerschoff, a social worker in Pietermaritzburg who has
been involved in past reconciliation efforts, said the agreement
was not the final step toward peace.
   Because of government bans and restrictions, he said in a
telephone interview, ``it is extremely difficult for COSATU and the
UDF to communicate with grassroots people. This will have to be
addressed.''
   The Natal violence has distressed anti-apartheid campaigners
elsewhere in South Africa and sparked debate over whether black
political groups could unite effectively to oppose the white-led
government.
   Some commentators viewed the conflict as a harbinger of
widespread infighting that might develop as black groups with
different ideologies struggled for supremacy.

<HEAD>Iran, Iraq Accuse Each Other of 74 Cease-fire Violations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA WATSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran and Iraq accused each other Friday of
violating a two-week cease-fire more than 70 times, and a new U.N.
mediator sought ways to break a deadlock in talks aimed at ending
their eight-year war.
   The foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq met separately Friday
with Swedish diplomat Jan Eliasson. U.N. spokeswoman Therese
Gastaut said the talks were ``intensive'' but declined to provide
further details.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar appointed
Eliasson mediator on Thursday.
   The foreign ministers, Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran and Tariq Aziz
of Iraq, have not met since Aug. 26, the second day of the talks.
Since then, the talks have continued at a lower, technical level.
They are to continue on Saturday.
   The talks have bogged down over follow-up procedures to the
cease-fire, which took effect Aug. 20. The problems involve the
withdrawal of troops and freedom of navigation in the Persian Gulf.
   After meeting with Eliasson, Velayati told reporters that
``after the establishment of the cease-fire, Iraq has had more than
60 kinds of violations of the terms of the cease-fire.''
   The Iranian diplomatic mission later released a list of what it
said were 74 violations of the cease-fire by Iraq as of Aug. 31,
which it said were reported to the U.N. secretary general.
   The list included alleged violations on every day of the
cease-fire except Aug. 28 and Aug. 31. It said there were nine
violations on the first day.
   The last entry said that on Aug. 30, Iraqi forces fired an
artillery shell in the Mehran area, about 100 miles east of
Baghdad, in the central front, killing four people.
   The official Iraqi News Agency also said it counted 74 reports
of cease-fire violations by Iran since the cease-fire.
   It said the Iranians aimed, ``through these violations, to
reorganize some of their military units, establishing observation
posts, firing flares and moving personnel-laden vehicles.''
   It repeated previous claims that Iranian gunfire was aimed at
Iraqi positions and that an Iraqi soldier was killed.
   In addition, Iranian forces ``attempted to approach the border
in various sectors, and reinforced their units in forward
positions, and redeployed in new areas,'' the agency said.
   Iran's commander and chief and Parliament speaker, Hashemi
Rafsanjani, said Iraq is trying to ``rekindle the flames of war''
by claiming sovereignty over the disputed Shatt-al-Arab waterway, a
major sticking point in the negotiations.
   A 1975 treaty split the waterway down the middle, but Iraq
claims the pact is void and has made ownership of the entire
waterway along the southern border a key issue at the peace talks.
   Tehran radio and the official Islamic Republic News Agency,
monitored in Cyprus, said Rafsanjani spoke at a prayer sermon at
Tehran University.
   ``We call on the armed forces to observe the cease-fire fully,
but if the enemy commits an offense, then it is only just that we
should answer him,'' he said. ``We should preserve our full
preparedness at the fronts until we arrive at a lasting peace.''

   Americans have joined the
investigation of two captured gunmen thought to be IRA members,
officials said Friday, and a television report said one may be a
major arms buyer for the Irish guerrillas.
   West German police captured the heavily armed men late Tuesday
after they crossed the border from the Netherlands near Waldfeucht,
45 miles northwest of Cologne. British military installations are
located in the area.
   The Supreme Court issued an arrest warrant Wednesday naming them
as Gerard Thomas Hanratty, 29, and Terence Gerard McGeough, 30, and
saying they were prime suspects in Irish Republican Army bomb
attacks at British military installations in West Germany.
   ``We are currently working with investigators from Great
Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium and the United States,''
Alexander Prechtel, chief spokesman for the federal prosecutor's
office, told The Associated Press by telephone from Karlsruhe.
   Asked whether the FBI was involved, Prechtel said: ``We are
starting to make contact with the FBI. The men are being sought in
the United States for illegal possession of weapons, as far as I
know.''
   U.S. authorities in West Germany said they were unable to
confirm or deny the involvement of American investigators. ``People
here who follow such matters don't know of any such connection at
the present time,'' U.S. Embassy spokesman Bob Heath said.
   Britain's Independent Television News said Thursday night
McGeough may be a top arms buyer for the IRA and is suspected of
organizing recent arms shipments from Libya. Moammar Gadhafi, the
Libyan leader is said to have backed the IRA for several years.
   Asked about the report, Prechtel said: ``We have no official
information about the men's role in the IRA. We are currently
working with British authorities to try to establish that.
``British authorities have told us that McGeough and Hanratty had
been on the run for years.''
   West German and international authorities are working together
to trace the men's previous activities, he said.
   Arresting officers found two AK-47 assault rifles and three .38
caliber pistols in the Irishmen's car, Prechtel said.
   He quoted ballistics experts as saying one of the rifles
probably was used in a July 13 bombing attack on a British army
barracks in Duisburg and the shooting May 1 of Royal Air Force
members in the Netherlands.
   Nine soldiers were wounded at Duisburg. One was killed and two
were wounded at Roermond in southern Holland.
   McGeough and Hanratty are being held in a maximum security
prison, Prechtel said.
   The IRA, almost exclusively Roman Catholic, is fighting to drive
Britain from Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and unite it
with the Irish Republic, which is 95 percent Catholic.

   A Gulf weather system exploded Friday into
Hurricane Debby, the first hurricane of the season, and was bearing
down on the east coast of Mexico, National Hurricane Center
forecasters said.
   The Mexican government posted hurricane warnings from Punta
Jerez to Vera Cruz for Debby, which had winds of 75 mph, making it
a minimal hurricane, said forecaster Hal Gerrish.
   ``All precautions should be rushed to completion in what little
time remains before the center crosses the coast near Tuxpan in the
next several hours,'' Gerrish warned Friday afternoon.
   Heavy rains accumulating up to 10 inches can be expected over
parts of Mexico, and flash floods and mud slides may occur in the
area of the warning and inland Friday and Friday night, he said.
   Debby surprised forecasters, rapidly developing into a tropical
storm early Fridday and then into a hurricane by the afternoon,
Gerrish said. On Friday morning, forecasters had expected the storm
to fizzle out when it hit Mexico's coast.
   But an Air Force reconnaissance plane found that Debby was
gaining strength as it approached the coast.
   ``This is a small system and sometimes small systems can
strengthen rapidly in this area without much warning,'' Gerrish
explained.
   At 2:30 p.m. EDT, Debby was located 30 miles east of Tuxpan,
Mexico, moving west at 7 mph. The center was located at 20.8
degrees north latitude and 97.0 degrees west longitude.
   Debby was the fourth named storm of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane
season, and the first hurricane.

   A court acquitted a 66-year-old man Friday
who had walked through the streets of Graz cursing Jews and raising
his arm in the Nazi salute.
   Witnesses said Rudolf Hofer had shouted anti-Semitic remarks,
the Austria Press Agency reported. It said the incident occurred
this summer but did not give a date.
   Hofer also said, ``I am going to finish off all Jews with my
10-man unit and two hand grenades,'' witnesses testified, and was
challenged by two passersby who called a policeman.
   According to the news agency report, the judge said a law
against anti-Semitic incitement did not apply because few people
were present at the time. The prosecutor appealed.
   An Austrian soldier was fined two months ago for making
anti-Semitic remarks in a bar.
   When the Nazis ruled Germany, and Austria after March 1938,
people raised their right arms in schools and at rallies and other
public events, shouting ``Heil Hitler!''

   New York City Mayor Edward I. Koch
answered a heckler with a vulgar gesture during a speech to the New
York City police union's convention.
   Koch, speaking to the Police Benevolent Association on Thursday,
was interrupted by a heckler who yelled an obscenity as Koch last
month's Tompkins Square Park riot.
   Koch responded by telling a joke. As part of the punch line, he
grabbed the crook of his right arm while lifting his right forearm.
``That's for you,'' he said to the heckler, prompting loud applause
and laughter.
   The police convention, held in upstate Monticello, initially had
given a cool reception to Koch as he spoke about the Aug. 7 riot,
which broke out as police tried to enforce a late-night curfew in
the Manhattan park.
   Dozens of protesters and passers-by lodged complaints of police
brutality, and an official investigation found that the Police
Department acted irresponsibly and several high-ranking police
officials were disciplined.
   After Koch returned to the riot issue, telling the assembly:
``We're going to call on you again in the near future. This time,
(act) within the rules.''
   ``Aw, come on _ you're taking all the fun out of it!'' one man
shouted.

   More than 60 Iowans returned home Friday
after 10 days in Idaho harvesting surplus hay to replace forage the
drought has cost them, and they were greeted by friends, relatives
and Gov. Terry Branstad.
   ``I just want you to know the people of Iowa appreciate what
you've done,'' Branstad told the workers. ``As you know, 1988 has
been a rough year, and we are proud of the way our farmers have
handled it. Sometimes the worst of times bring out the best in
people.''
   Residents brought out coffee and donuts to greet the 64 workers
when the buses rolled in at 7:20 a.m.
   The workers, all volunteers and including both farmers and
non-farmers, said they were tired but enjoyed the experience.
   ``There were long days and a lot of hard work but a lot of fun
to go with it,'' said Lane Schuldt, a livestock farmer from near
Van Wert.
   The buses also made other stops Friday morning in Bevington,
Osceola, Chariton and Albia.
   The Iowans boarded buses in those communities Aug. 21 and joined
volunteers from other Midwest states in harvesting more than 10,000
bales of hay. The hay came from set-aside land that was opened for
emergency harvesting by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in
response to the drought that stunted grass in Midwest fields.
   The hay will be distributed first to farmers who made the trip
or sent workers on the trip, said Bill Belden, Farm Bureau regional
manager in Monroe County, noting that some farmers could not leave
but instead hired workers to go to Idaho.
   Others high on the list for the hay are needy farmers who could
not make the trip because of age or health.
   ``Many Iowa livestock producers were faced with potential
liquidation of their herds. This hay will maybe held tide them
over,'' Branstad said.
   ``I need some hay,'' said Schuldt, who isn't sure how much he
will receive.
   Some of the workers are not farmers but took the trip anyway.
   ``I just wanted to help out,'' said Dave Pomeroy, who lives in
Pomeroy and holds a non-farm job in Webster City.
   ``It's been a lot of fun,'' he said. ``It was very nice. I'd
never been out there.''
   The project was coordinated by Farm Bureau officials in Iowa and
Idaho. They arranged free transportation by Greyhound buses and
free rail shipment of the hay by Burlington Northern. Food, lodging
and haying equipment in Idaho were donated by local businesses and
farmers.
   ``It's beautiful country out there, and I couldn't believe the
way the people treated us,'' said Schuldt.
   ``They were excellent people,'' Pomeroy said. ``We ate well all
the way.''
   The hay is not due to arrive for several days, so arrangements
must still be made to unload it from the train and haul it to
farms, and Belden said more volunteers are being sought for that
job.
   The governor said he called Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus on Thursday
to express his thanks.
   ``Maybe the time will come when they'll need our help, and we
can reciprocate,'' he said.

   All babies are cute, and that's why Glen
Cove is canceling its Labor Day baby contest.
   Millie DeRiggi, the mayor's wife, said only 32 children
participated in last year's baby contest because many parents were
disappointed that their kids came out as losers.
   No one appreciated the Baby Booby Prize.
   The Long Island community will have a baby parade Saturday, and
all 130 children participating in the event will receive gold stars
to hang around their necks, and ice cream.
   Mrs. DeRiggi says the children should be celebrated, not rated.

   The Harrisburg Patriots football team
looked forward for a grand season opener Sunday night with a new
$1.38 million field and scoreboard.
   There's only one thing missing _ the stands.
   Mayor Stephen Reed said the Southern Bleacher Co. of Graham,
Texas, inadvertently shipped sections of the new bleachers to
another city. The bleachers will be picked up and shipped by air to
Harrisburg and it will take about five days to erect them, Reed
said.
   The Patriots, part of the Continental Interstate Football
League, will move their opener against the Pocono Mountaineers to

Skyline Sports Complex for a Sept. 10 game against the Chambersburg

   Call them the mountain bike cops.
   Within a month, the Police Department hopes to have two
uniformed officers patrolling the downtown area on 18-speed
mountain bicycles.
   ``In a downtown area, (bicycles) are the fastest way to
respond,'' said Sgt. C.M. Poole, the department's downtown liaison
officer.
   The department began considering the idea after an officer
suggested a bicycle would be easier than a car to maneuver on
downtown streets and sidewalks.
   The chosen two will wear helmets and padded bicycle shorts as
long as the warm weather lasts. They will carry a gun and radio.
   With winter approaching, this is not the ideal season to
experiment with bicycles, Poole said. ``But if it works in the
winter, it will work anytime,'' he said.

<HEAD>Expelled Author Invited to Join Memorial Committee for Stalin
Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alexander Solzhenitsyn, expelled in 1974 for
writing about the horrors of Josef Stalin's rule, was invited to
join an official committee building a monument to the dictator's
victims, an organizer said Friday.
   The move does not necessarily mean an easing in official
attitudes toward the dissident writer, but it is due to the number
of Soviet citizens who think Solzhenitsyn is one of the best
qualified people to serve on the committee, said organizer Yuri
Samadunov.
   The 1970 Nobel laureate's masterwork, ``The Gulag Archipelago,''
traces the history of political repression in the Soviet Union and
dwells at length on the purges and widespread repression that
marred the 29-year reign of Stalin.
   Solzhenitsyn, who spent eight years in labor camps under Stalin,
was expelled from the Soviet Union after the publication of the
``Gulag'' trilogy in the West. He now lives in Cavendish, Vt.
   Under Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Stalin and his legacy
have come in for increasingly severe criticism. In July, the ruling
Communist Party Politburo approved the building of a monument in
Moscow to Stalin victims.
   On Aug. 25, a public council to supervise the construction and
maintenance of the monument was formed, as well as an executive
committee to submit a blueprint for the memorial's design.
   Among those selected for the public council were Solzhenitsyn,
fellow dissident and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Andrei D. Sakharov,
poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko and Boris Yeltsin, the fiery former Moscow
party boss.
   Samadunov, a member of the executive committee, said the members
of the public council were chosen in street polls conducted at two
central Moscow locations, as well as from names submitted by
readers to Literaturnaya Gazeta, Ogonyok and other state-run
publications.
   ``We chose the first 17 people mentioned, and Solzhenitsyn was
among them,'' said Samadunov in a telephone interview. This week's
edition of Moscow News listed Solzhenitsyn as a member of the
public council charged with building the memorial.
   But Samadunov said the committee had not yet been able to notify
Solzhenitsyn that he had been selected for the committee, or to
determine whether he would agree to take part in its work.
   ``We sent him a telegram with news of his selection and that of
the others, and asked his agreement, but the telegram was returned
to us with a notice that it could not be delivered because the
address was not precise enough,'' said Samadunov.
   Solzhenitsyn's wife, Natalya, said through a family spokesman
that ``no telegram has been received,'' and that they will issue a
public statement if they get it. She declined to say whether
Solzhenitsyn would accept an invitation to serve on the committee.
   She previously has said the writer has no plans to visit the
Soviet Union. In June, the editor of the literary monthly Novy Mir
said he was negotiating for the right to print Solzhenitsyn's novel
``Cancer Ward,'' which would mark the first publication of a work
by Solzhenitsyn in his native land since he was expelled.

<HEAD>Bush Continues Fiery Attack On Dukakis Over Environment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELMAR, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush kept up his attack on
Democrat Michael Dukakis' environmental record, accusing the
Massachusetts governor of seeking to pollute the waters of New
Jersey where sewage has closed beaches.
   In fiery remarks, Bush stood on a sunny New Jersey beach and
told supporters he has one question for his Democratic opponent:
   ``Why did you pledge a clean ocean to the people of New Jersey
when your own state applied to pollute it?''
   Displaying the feisty campaign style he has recently adopted,
Bush shouted with disdain as he referred to a 1985 application from
Dukakis' as governor of Massachusetts to dump his state's waste in
an ocean dump site 106 miles off New Jersey.
   ``For almost two years, he fought to allow Boston's sludge to be
dumped off New Jersey's shore _ the very shore on which he had the
nerve to stand and promise clean water. Nice guy _ yeah,'' Bush
said sarcastically.
   He told the beach-clad crowd of supporters that if Dukakis comes
to their shores on another campaign trip, ``Be sure to ask him,
'Why did you want to dump Boston sludge off our coast in New
Jersey?'''
   A compromise allowed Massachusetts to dump further out beyond
the continental shelf.
   Bush was heckled by Dukakis supporters who chanted ``Where was
George?'' and carried signs ridiculing the Reagan adminisration's
Environmental Protection Agency as being weak.
   But the few hundred Bush supporters who had tickets to enter the
roped off beach section where he spoke, drowned out the protesters
with chants of ``We want George.''
   At one point a plane flew over pulling a banner with the words,
``Where was Teddy Kennedy?'' It was the Massachusetts senator one
who made the ``Where was George?'' line a Democratic rallying cry
in his speech at the party's convention this summer.
   Bush laughed when he saw the plane, saying, ``Where did that guy
come from?''
   Then he said, ``So I was home with Barbara. What's wrong with
that?''
   The remark appeared to be an oblique version to a quip making
the rounds of Republican circles that Bush was home, dry and in bed
with his wife, a pointed reference to the time Kennedy drove his
car off a bridge at Chappaquidick after a party and a young woman
passenger drowned.
   Bush told the crowd that ``nobody fools nature over the long
run.'' He said he would fight ``to ban ocean dumping forever,'' and
would ``make the enforcement of Superfund, the prosecution of
polluters, and the cleanup of toxic waste a top priority.''
   Bush was introduced by New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean, and later
was met on a Delaware stop by Gov. Michael Castle and former Gov.
Pete du Pont, who sought the GOP presidential nomination earlier
this year.
   Bush wen to historical New Castle, Del., for another
environmental speech and a crabbling demonstration.
   In an interview with a group of outdoor reporters and editors
Bush, who has been saying, ``I am an environmentalist'' at every
campaign stop in recent days, said he was also a sportsman who has
fished and hunted for years.
   ``Anybody who loves these outdoor sports as much as I do has to
be concerned with clean water,'' he said.
   Bush avoided reporters' questions about Dukakis' decision to
re-hire John Sasso, a former campaign manager who quit last year
because he distributed a videotape that helped drive Delaware Sen.
Joseph Biden out of the Democratic presidential race.
   ``I haven't thought about it,'' Bush said at one point.
   But later, while bobbing around in boats in the Delaware River
for a crabbing demonstration, reporters shouted questions about
Sasso across the water.
   The vice president at first shook his head and then held up one
of the crabs in the boat, saying, ``Speaking of crabs.''

   Cigarette manufacturers collectively bought
377.2 million pounds of flue-cured tobacco last season, about 6
percent more than the companies had indicated they would purchase,
the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Vern Neppl, acting administrator of the department's
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, said the
purchases covered the period from July 1, 1987, through June 30,
1988.
   Neppl said the companies had stated they planned to buy 355
million pounds during the marketing year. By law, companies are
penalized if they fail to purchase at least 90 percent of the
quantity they state as their intentions.
   Because crop marketings were below the 1987 effective quota for
flue-cured tobacco, the manufacturers needed to purchase only 83.1
percent of their intended quantity, Neppl said.

<HEAD>Kentucky Replaces Road Signs Missing Governor's Middle Initial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COVINGTON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kentucky wants signs welcoming travelers
at all highway points of entry to be letter perfect.
   So it is replacing some that dropped the middle initial ``G''
from Gov. Wallace Wilkinson's name.
   Transportation Secretary Milo D. Bryant said failing to use the
``G'' _ for Glenn _ in the governor's name amounts to misspelling
the name.
   ``Obviously, it's not correct. That's not his name that he was
sworn in as governor,'' Bryant said.
   The error occurred earlier this year, Bryant said. He said an
alert supervisor noticed that workers were leaving out the ``G.''
The signs the department has made since the discovery bear the
initial.
   Bryant estimated only 10-12 signs are being changed, at a cost
of perhaps $44 for each. He was unsure of labor costs and other
expenses in the replacement project, but said it might be in the
$200 to $300 range.
   ``It was not a big deal,'' Bryant said.
   Richard Jones, who recently saw a crew of three men and two
trucks working to remove one of the signs on the Suspension Bridge
between Covington and Cincinnati, said he thought the action ``was
a waste of money.''
   ``I figure the money they used on that could have gone out here
to help the poor people on the street,'' said Jones, a 43-year-old
retiree from the Navy who rarely uses his middle initial _ ``H''
for Henry.
   Who ordered the change is unclear. Bryant said he wasn't sure.
He said he did not receive instructions from the governor or his
staff to change them.
   ``I doubt the governor even knows about it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Anti-Drinking Campaign, Chernobyl Put Soviet Budget in the Red</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's anti-drinking campaign and
the Chernobyl nuclear plant accident have helped put the Soviet
Union budget in the red by ``many billions of rubles,'' an
economist reported Friday.
   V. Bochkov, writing in the newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya, said
many specialists estimate the deficit as equal to 15 percent to 17
percent of state revenues.
   The economist did not give a specific figure, but said the
Soviet deficit was ``many billions of rubles,'' an amount he said
was nearly half of what is being spent to meet the country's social
and cultural needs.
   The Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee, in a July
plenary meeting, said that when next year's state budget and
economic plan are drawn up it will be necessary to take decisive
steps to cut the deficit.
   The 1988 government budget, as approved by the Supreme Soviet
parliament in October, totals $773 billion. In his article, Bochkov
specifically noted $66 billion in unforeseen expenses or revenue
shortfalls:
   _ Lower world prices for oil and oil products, a major Soviet
export item, have led to a $23 billion drop in foreign income.
   _ Slashes in the production of vodka and other alcoholic drinks,
a key measure in Gorbachev's 3-year-old anti-drinking campaign,
have resulted in a $30 billion drop in state revenue from alcohol
sales.
   _ Finally, an additional $12.6 billion have been spent to cope
with the aftermath of the 1986 nuclear reactor explosion and fire
at the Chernobyl power plant, which sparked the evacuation of more
than 130,000 residents of the northern Ukraine and southern
Byelorussia.
   Bochkov said that more than 70 percent of Soviet national income
is redistributed through the state budget. In line with Gorbachev's
drive to make each sector of the Soviet economy self-sufficient,
Bochkov called for a decisive move to self-financing.
   However, many Soviet factories and enterprises are still far
from being able to stand on their own feet and meet expenses
through their own revenues, and depend on periodic injections of
government funds.
   Bochkov said Soviet warehouses and store shelves are now clogged
with $746 billion in goods that no one wants to buy, and since the
products remain unsold, the state earns no revenue from them.
   In his article, the economist also issued an indirect call for
slimmed-down defense spending, saying: ``As in any sector of the
expenditure of budgetary resources, in the military sector there is
also the possibility of economy.''
   The Soviet Union's 1988 budget officially allocates $32 billion
for defense, but Western analysts contend actual Soviet military
spending is many times that figure.

   A Kansas City, Mo., firm has been approved to
conduct a field test this fall of a genetically altered vaccine
designed to protect swine against pseudorabies, a contagious
disease that can be deadly to newborn pigs, the Agriculture
Department said Friday.
   The vaccine will be tested by Fermenta Animal Health Co., after
Oct. 1 on hog farms in Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Minnesota and
Nebraska.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said three previous pseudorabies
vaccines have been field tested and licensed for manufacture.
   As with the earlier tests, the Fermenta vaccine and testing
program has been reviewed and ``will pose no significant risks to
the environment,'' he said.
   Pseudorabies, also known as Aujesky's disease or mad itch, does
not affect humans, Glosser said.
   The National Pork Producers Council estimates that the disease
caused $36 million in losses last year.

<TEXT>
   The director of the school lunch program in
Hempstead allegedly stole hundreds of pounds of cheese and other
food donated by the federal government and used it at his cafe,
authorities said Friday.
   Samuel V. Eveleno, 56, of Greenlawn, was arrested on a federal
complaint following an investigation begun in April after an
inspector on a routine sanitation inspection is said to have
discovered 320 pounds of Agriculture Department food at Eveleno's
Long Island restaurant.
   The food included large commercial packages of American and
mozzarella cheese, raisins, vegetables, butter, honey, instant
mashed potatoes and refried beans.
   Eveleno, who was employed by a private food service company
under contract to the Hempstead School District to run its
cafeterias, owns the Backstage Cafe, a food concession at the East
Side Comedy Club in Huntington, according to the complaint.
   His duties as school lunch director included inventory and use
of food donated to the schools by the Agriculture Department under
its school lunch program, said U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney of
Brooklyn, whose office is handling the case.
   While the complaint alleged wrongdoing only from April to
August, one of his cafe employees told investigators that Eveleno
had used 50 to 60 cases of USDA foodstuffs since August 1987 and
that he usually brought the commodities in every other week, the
complaint said.
   Some of the food at the Backstage Cafe still carried a label
that read, ``Donated by the United States Department of
Agriculture, For Food Help Programs, Not To Be Sold or Exchanged,''
Maloney said.
   A call to James Galloway, assistant school superintendent in
Hempstead, on Long Island, was not immediately returned.
   Eveleno is charged with theft of federally donated foods, which
carries a maximum sentence upon conviction of five years in prison
and a $250,000 fine.
   He was released on his own recognizance at his arraignment
before U.S. Magistrate Carol Amon. Neither Eveleno or his attorney,
Stephen Worth, would comment on the charges.

<TEXT>
   The Israeli army said Friday it was working for
the speedy release of an air navigator captured in Lebanon last
year and that it holds the Lebanese Amal militia responsible for
his health.
   A statement from the military command read to reporters by
telephone said Israel questioned the ``credibility and source'' of
recent reports from Lebanon that the navigator Ron Arad, 30, was in
poor health.
   But it said: ``Israel stresses and reiterates it considers the
Amal organization, and its leader, (Lebanese Justice Minister)
Nabih Berri, responsible for the health and safety of the navigator
and hopes all necessary steps will be taken in keeping with this
responsibility.
   ``Israel will continue to work to return the navigator safe and
sound as soon as possible,'' said the statement, which also was
broadcast by Israel radio.
   Lebanese miltiamen shot down Arad's phantom fighter with a
shoulder-launched SAM-7 missile during an Oct. 16 bombing mission
in south Lebanon. The pilot was rescued by helicopter.
   After his capture, Israel announced that Arad was being held by
Amal, a Shiite Moslem group and rival to the pro-Iranian Hezbollah
Movement.
   The army's statement follows a radio appeal by Arad's wife,
Tami, who said she and their 3-year-old daughter had not received
any information about her husband in more than a year.
   ``The hardest thing is the uncertainty and lack of contact,''
Mrs. Arad told Israel army radio on July 21. ``If I could only know
how he is, and what he does, and whether he's in good health, it
would be easier.''
   She also urged her husband to be strong. ``We shall do
everything so that we can be together soon,'' she said. ``We
believe in you and cross our fingers for you.''
   Five other Israelis are missing in action in Lebanon.
   Two, captured in 1986, are believed held by Hezbollah. Three
others have been reported missing since a tank battle with Syrian
forces in eastern Lebanon on June 11, 1982.

   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of
West Germany abruptly broke off a lecture Friday and left the hall
complaining of illness.
   After a hurried hospital examination, Genscher left Norway on
schedule aboard his West German air force plane, West German
Embassy and airport officials said.
   ``We have been informed that it is nothing serious, but it was
after all decided that he would undergo an examination at the
hospital,'' said spokesman Ivar Melbye.
   Officials had no immediate word on the nature of his ailment.
   Genscher, 61, read the text of his speech for 10 minutes before
his voice grew faint and he stopped, said a photographer for the
Norwegian national news agency NTB.
   The foreign minister, who was speaking at Oslo University's Aula
hall at the end of a two-day official visit, walked out unassisted
and was taken in a police car to State Hospital. West German
Ambassador Harald Hofmann finished reading the lecture.
   The address to the Norwegian-German Society was held in the
concert hall where the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded annually. It
opened a planned series of lectures on international issues.
   Earlier, Genscher met with Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland,
his Norwegian collegue and host Thorvald Stoltenberg, and members
of the Parliament's foreign relations committee.

<HEAD>More MK-6 Rafts Fail Tests, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy has found more MK-6 inflatable life
boats that failed to operate properly as the Pentagon continues to
investigate a West Virginia company that produced the rafts,
according to a published report.
   A Navy official who spoke on condition he not be identified
confirmed Friday that a small number of the 25-man rafts were
tested and that some had safety defects, which he did not identify.
   The spokesman, however, said he could not confirm a report in
The Pittsburgh Press that each life boat failed the testing.
   ``Indeed we have started testing the MK-6,'' he said. ``Some of
the safety problems ... have been found in the small number that
have been tested. I can't say each one'' had safety defects.
   The Navy is informing its fleet and is organizing an effort to
deal with the problems, the spokesman said.
   ``Our inspector general has been seriously involved with
concerns over the safety of the MK-6 and definitely is soliciting
inputs from all the involved agencies in the Navy,'' he said.
   The spokesman said each of those tested was produced by Rubber
Crafters Inc. of Grantsville, W.Va.
   The company's offices and factory were raided Aug. 8 by agents
of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the Federal Bureau
of Investigation and the Naval Investigative Service. The newspaper
reported at the time that the agents seized records but made no
arrests.
   Company officials declined comment.
   An affidavit filed in connection with a search warrant obtained
by the investigators claimed that Rubber Crafters supplied 63
defective MK-6 rafts to the Navy in 1986. The document claimed that
Rubber Crafters used inferior materials, falsified test results and
altered boat serial numbers in an effort to hide the defects.
   The investigators found four suspect rafts in Norfolk, Va., and
a small number of others were found during within the last two days
at Philadelphia and Mare Island, Calif., The Pittsburgh Press said.
   Rubber Crafters was paid more than $17 million and made nearly
2,150 MK-6 boats since 1984, when it won the supply contract from
B.F. Goodrich.
   The Navy has about 12,500 of the boats, which are stocked with
water, medical gear and other survival supplies.

<HEAD>Bush Campaign Tried to Recruit Greek Translator From Voice of

   The George Bush campaign tried to hire an
employee of the Voice of America to translate statements by the
Republican nominee into Greek for Michael Dukakis' natural
constituency of Greek-American voters, according to agency
documents and personnel.
   The overture to an editor at the federally financed overseas
radio network prompted the VOA's general counsel to issue a
memorandum warning eployees against violating the 1939 Hatch Act,
which bars federal workers from taking part in partisan political
activities.
   VOA spokeswoman Judy Jamison said the agency's chief lawyer
``was prepared to recommend against'' accepting the Bush campaign's
job offer, but never did because the editor said he wasn't
interested in taking it.
   The employee, George Bistis, said in a memo that he received a
call Aug. 23 offering him an eight-week assignment translating
several texts of news about Bush or statements by him that were
intended for Greek-Americans.
   In the memo, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated
Press, Bistis said he told the caller, Eva Neterowicz, that
believed such an assignment would violate the Hatch Act.
   ``She answered that in her opinion there is no conflict because
the job offered involved translating services rather than engaging
in political activity,'' Bistis said.
   ``After all, she remarked, other people at VOA are working for
us and they don't seem to think that there is any conflict with the
Hatch Act,'' Bistis quoted her as saying.
   Ms. Neterowicz, chief of the nationalities department of the
Bush campaign, confirmed in an interview that she had tried to hire
VOA employees for part-time jobs providing translations for 26
ethnic groups, including Greek-Americans, at $50 per text.
   She said that ``we were told there was no problem'' with hiring
VOA personnel. But she said all her translators currently are from
private business and none is from the VOA.
   Bistis' supervisor, Andreas Antypas, deputy chief of VOA's
European division, wrote the congressional General Accounting
Office giving details of the incident and mentioning the case of
another employee from the VOA's Hungarian service who had performed
translations for the Bush campaign.
   ``I find it highly objectionable that any political organization
should feel free to fish around in the VOA for translators of
partisan political material,'' Antypas wrote.
   GAO official Paul Atkins said he relayed the Antypas memo to the
general counsel of the congressional watchdog agency.
   VOA spokeswoman Jamison said the agency receives dozens of
requests for translators because many of its employees are
multilingual. ``In this case, of course, it was different because
we're talking about a political campaign,'' she said.
   She said she did not know of any other agency employees who were
approached by the Bush campaign, but said a VOA engineer had asked
for a three-month leave to work for the Dukakis campaign.
   The VOA general counsel's memo said there may be ``very limited
and specific'' cases in which outside jobs associated with partisan
politics are permissible. But he said employees must receive his
written approval in advance before accepting them.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American work force is in its best shape
ever, despite a drop in manufacturing jobs and a dramatic slowdown
in service industry hiring, Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin said
Friday.
   ``Employment is still at record levels and that's good,'' Ms.
McLaughlin said in the second State of the Workforce address,
delivered before the Chicago Federation of Labor. Her predecessor,
William Brock, gave the first such address in Philadelphia last
year.
   ``The state of the work force in 1988 is good and getting better
_ the best it has ever been. But it isn't as good as it can be,''
she said.
   ``If workers, managers, government and unions can cooperate ...
we can offer a job to everyone in this country who wants one _
provided they're educated, skilled and prepared for the
workplace,'' Ms. McLaughlin said.
   The key labor issue is no longer unemployment, it's the
unemployable, she said. ``In the future, more than ever before, the
unemployed will be the underskilled,'' she said.
   Ms. McLaughlin's speech followed the Labor Department's release
Friday of unemployment figures for August, which showed the
nation's jobless rate rose to 5.6 percent last month.
   It was the second straight monthly increase. The July rate of
5.4 percent was 0.1 higher than June's 5.3 percent, a 14-year low.
   Ms. McLaughlin said the jobless rate had been fluctuating
between 5.3 percent and 5.6 percent since March.
   She praised the Reagan administration for creating 17 million
new jobs in the past five years and called for efforts to educate
and train workers with and without jobs.
   ``The day must never come when we have a worker deficit in this
country because we've failed as a nation to provide opportunities
for excellence and relevance in education, training and
retraining,'' she said.
   Ms. McLaughlin left out attacks on the Democratic Party in a
departure from her prepared text, which contained a reference to
Democrats in Congress who in 1982 tried to pass what she called ``a
costly public jobs program'' with a $3.5 million price tag.
   She also did not mention Democratic presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis by name, referring to him only as ``the other
candidate'' in acknowledging his endorsement last week by the
AFL-CIO, an endorsement supported by the Chicago federation.
   But Ms. McLaughlin criticized the Massachusetts governor as
``not terribly economically astute and literate'' at a news
conference after her speech.
   In 1983, she said Massachusetts lost 45,000 manufacturing jobs
while 1 million jobs were created nationwide.
   The Labor Department reported the goods-producing side of the
economy lost jobs in August for the first time since last January.
Employment in manufacturing was down by 5,000 after a 70,000 jump
in July.
   Susan Estrich, Dukakis's campaign manager, said from Boston that
the loss of those jobs was a ``blow to hopes for prosperity in the
nation's heartland (and) to hopes of easing the squeeze on working
Americans.''

<HEAD>NLRB Files Complaint Against Writers Guild</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Labor Relations Board has filed
a complaint seeking to invalidate Writers Guild of America rules
that limit members' ability to quit the union during a strike.
   ``It's like an indictment. We are a prosecutor alleging a
violation of the law,'' said Sidney Rosen, a regional NLRB officer.
   The unfair labor practices complaint, filed Thursday, supports
an action filed by 21 dissident members of the WGA during the
guild's 154-day strike against movie and television producers. The
strike, one of the longest in entertainment industry history, ended
last month.
   The dissidents and the NLRB argue that the guild's constitution
illegally allows the union to fine writers for working during a
strike even if the writers resign from the union before going back
to work.
   The complaint called for a Nov. 3 hearing before an
administrative law judge in Los Angeles, and could eventually lead
to a hearing before the labor board in Washington.
   WGA officers said they hadn't been served with the complaint. In
a statement, however, the guild said it expects to prevail in the
lawsuit before the NLRB ``or on appeal to the federal courts, if
necessary.'' The guild also argued that the issue is moot now that
the strike is over.
   Lionel Chetwynd, one of the 21 writers who signed the original
complaint, said a guild official recently urged the dissidents to
drop their complaint. But he disputed the notion that the complaint
is hurting the guild.
   ``Clearly, there are deep problems with the guild. You could
look at this as a first step in clearing away the debris, and
getting our constitution in line with the law of the land,''
Chetwynd said Thursday.

<TEXT>
   A California Highway Patrol make-believe training
memo about Sandinista terrorists waging war on law enforcement
officers made it into the hands of Metro-Dade police, who took it
very seriously.
   So seriously that Metro-Dade's intelligence unit issued a memo
of their own, in which they warned officers to be wary of a feared
Nicaraguan gang, suspected in the March shooting death of Miami
police Officer Victor Estefan.
   ``The attached memorandum from the California Highway Patrol
infers that members fo the Sandinista National Liberation Front ...
will utilize deadly force against law enforcement officers who come
in contact with them,'' the Aug. 11 Metro-Dade memo said.
   ``Due to the large population of Nicaraguans in Dade County, the
probability of contact with these subjects is great,'' said the
memo, which was read to all members of the force at roll call.
   Oops, California Highway Patrol Sgt. Joe Farrow said Thursday
when told the creative training memo made it to Miami.
   ``This was not intended to go nationwide and scare people over
the Sandinistas,'' Farrow said. ``It's a training bulletin for our
guys. That's all it is.''
   Farrow didn't know how it ended up at Metro-Dade police or why
they were taking it seriously. He called the Miami version of the
memo, 11 paragraphs, a ``cut-and-paste job.'' Someone deleted the
cover page _ which was plainly marked _ ``Training Bulletin.''
   The bulletin mentioned the death Estefan on March 30 after a
traffic stop in Little Havana, a Cuban neighborhood in Miami.
California troopers arrested two Nicaraguan brothers during an
April 27 shoot-out near San Luis Obispo. The brothers, from Miami,
are suspects in Estefan's slaying, though they have not been
charged.
   Police do not believe the suspects to be involved in any
organized terrorist group.

   Clinging to her 16-month-old daughter
after the flight they were on went down, Tammy Robert was paralyzed
by confusion and fear.
   ``Someone was hollering, `It's gonna blow! It's gonna blow!' ...
And I knew that I wanted her out and alive. That's why I passed her
out to that man,'' said Robert.
   Robert, 37, of West Monroe, La., and her daughter, Sarah, were
passengers on the ill-fated Delta Flight 1141, which crashed at
takeoff Wednesday at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport,
killing 13 people. Ninety-five others survived.
   ``That man'' was fellow passenger Joe King, who had scrambled
out a gaping hole in the top of the Boeing 727, reached back into
the smoldering wreckage for the baby and slid down the fuselage
with Sarah cradled under one arm. Robert then managed to get out
herself.
   Sarah was the youngest survivor of the crash, and suffered only
minor injuries. She didn't even cry, her mother said.
   ``I'm just very thankful because I know without (King's) help, I
would not have gotten her to fresh air,'' Robert said Thursday at
Harris Methodist H.E.B. Hospital, where she was recovering from
smoke inhalation. ``Thanks to him, she doesn't have any scars.
   ``I think he deserves a gold medal,'' Robert added. ``I consider
him a hero. He was concerned about someone else, not only himself.''
   King, whose left index finger was almost severed when it caught
on something as he and Sarah slid to safety, doesn't see it that
way. Initially, he declined to speak to reporters because, as he
said later, he hadn't done anything extraordinary.
   ``I don't think there's anything heroic to it,'' said King, 38,
a Carrollton veterinarian with two young children of his own.
``You're there and it's got to be done and you just do it. I was
just glad to be able to help somebody.''
   King, released from Harris hospital Thursday, said he looks at
the world differently now.
   ``You think of all the things that could have happened. And to
realize they didn't ... there's a lot to be thankful for,'' he
said. ``Every day is better now.''
   Robert shares his sentiments, especially after playing the
details in her mind over and over.
   ``The good Lord helped us out,'' she said. ``He was there
holding my hand. I guess it wasn't our time.''
   ``Every time I see the plane I can't believe we were in it.''

<HEAD>800,000-Ton Corn Sale Reported</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
800,000 metric tons of U.S. corn for delivery during the 1988-89
marketing year that began Thursday, the Agriculture Department said
Friday.
   Sale of 100,000 tons of corn was announced a day earlier, also
for delivery in 1988-89.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 900,000 tons of
corn would be about 35.5 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.49 per bushel at the
farm level, meaning that the two sales could have a farm value of
around $88.4 million.
   There was no indication whether the new sales of corn would
count under the current long-term grain supply agreement between
the two countries or be carried forward separately in case a new
pact is forthcoming.
   The current five-year pact is set to expire Sept. 30 and
negotiators are currently trying to work out a new one, or at least
an extension of the current agreement, to take effect Oct. 1.
   Arthur K. Homann of the department's Foreign Agricultural
Service said it would be determined later how to count the latest
corn sales, depending on the actual shipping dates and whether
there is a new agreement.
   Regardless, the Soviet Union has already lived up to terms of
the final year of the agreement, which calls for the annual
purchase of at least 9 million tons of U.S. grain.
   According to the agreement, the annual purchases are supposed to
include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The
Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as
wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two
tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.
   Prior to this week's sales, the Soviet Union had purchased 9.05
million tons of wheat and 5.17 million tons of corn for delivery in
the fifth year of the agreement, plus 830,000 tons of soybeans and
1.3 million tons of soybean meal.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Friday leftist
guerrillas will be allowed to present their ideas on political,
economic and social change to Congress if they accept a cease-fire.
   President Virgilio Barco outlined the proposal in a televised
address Thursday night and Government Minister Cesar Gaviria gave
details Friday.
   Barco said guerrilla violence must end before direct contacts
are made.
   Guerrilla violence has claimed more than 75,000 lives in 20
years and the estimated numerical strength of rebel groups has
grown from 2,500 to 10,000 in a decade.
   Over the past year the guerrillas have blown up oil pipelines 45
times, attacked 14 towns, set off car bombs, attacked military
bases, ambushed army patrols and destroyed bridges, electricity
transmission towers and other government facilities.
   They have kidnapped dozens of ranchers for ransom since the
early 1980s and also have a U.S. captive _ Jake Gambini of Houston,
Tex., owner of General Pipe Co. He was kidnapped two months ago
from an oil company camp in Colombia's eastern plains but there
have been no reports of ransom demands.
   Gaviria, who is in charge of internal security, said preliminary
contacts with guerrillas can begin as soon as they end hostilities.
   After the cease-fire and initial contacts, the rebels would be
allowed to give Congress their proposals for change, the minister
said in an interview with the RCN radio network.
   Barco said Thursday night the peace plan's objective was
disbanding the guerrilla groups, and he repeated an amnesty offer
made last month.
   This is the second time a Colombian government has tried to
negotiate with the insurgents. In 1982, President Belisario
Betancur offered an amnesty and signed a truce with four of
Colombia's six rebel armies.
   Only about 300 guerrillas accepted pardons and the cease-fire
collapsed, with rebels and the military accusing each other of
violating it.
   Barco's plan differs in two important aspects _ provisions for
direct negotiations with the government and submission of guerrilla
proposals to Congress.
   Betancur met with guerrilla representatives twice but his
negotiators were not government officials, which led the rebels to
suspect he did not take the process seriously.
   Gaviria said the proporsed negotations would be handled by
himself and Barco's personal representative for guerrilla contacts,
Rafael Pardo Rueda, who was appointed last year and has met with
guerrilla leaders several times.
   No guerrilla reaction is expected for several days. Gaviria said
the insurgents were not given details in advance.

   Michael Dukakis, gearing up for ``a very tough, very
competitive'' general election campaign, announced Friday he was
rehiring John Sasso, his longtime political strategist who resigned
after anonymously triggering events that forced Sen. Joseph Biden
out of the Democratic primary campaign.
   ``It's going to be a battle royal for the presidency of the
United States,'' Dukakis said, announcing that his pugnacious
former campaign manager was returning as vice chairman of his
campaign.
   Sasso's return came as Republican opponent George Bush kept
pounding away at the Massachusetts governor, and amid polls that
showed Dukakis and Bush were locked in a dead-heat with the Labor
Day campaign kickoff just days away.
   Standing on a New Jersey beach Friday, the GOP nominee accused
Dukakis of contributing to its occasional pollution by arranging to
have sludge from Massachusetts dumped in nearby ocean waters.
   ``Almost a year ago, John Sasso made a very serious mistake,''
Dukakis said in California. ``He's paid the price.''
   Sasso stepped down last year after admitting that he distributed
a videotape showing that Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, then a
candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, had borrowed
virtually verbatim excerpts from a speech once delivered by British
Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock.
   That videotape and subsequent charges of plagiarism forced Biden
to drop out of the race.
   Dukakis said Biden ``could not have been more gracious'' when
told that Sasso was returning to his campaign.
   Biden, in a statement issued by his Senate office, said, ``I
continue to support Governor Dukakis.''
   Sasso, speaking at a news conference in Boston with campaign
chairman Paul Brountas and manager Susan Estrich, apologized for
the incident and said he did not intend to raise questions about
Biden's character.
   Dukakis has seen his double-digit lead over Bush in the polls
evaporate since the Republican National Convention last month, when
the GOP launched a sustained attack on the Democratic nominee.
   Nevertheless, Dukakis said Sasso's return was not a reflection
of disarray in his campaign.
   ``It's simply the fact we're looking at a little more than two
months of what is going to be a very tough, very competitive
campaign,'' Dukakis said, adding that he wanted to assemble ``the
strongest team I possibly can.''
   Craig Fuller, Bush's chief of staff, said the return of Sasso
``speaks for itself.'' But GOP vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle
was more blunt: ``I would say that this is another sign that the
Dukakis campaign is in serious trouble.''
   Bush stood Friday before a group of supporters clad in beach
attire to keep up his attack on Dukakis' environmental record.
   ``For almost two years, he fought to allow Boston's sludge to be
dumped off New Jersey's shore _ the very shore on which he had the
nerve to stand and promise clean water,'' Bush said. ``Nice guy _
yeah.''
   Bush spoke on a beach at Belmar, N.J., which has been closed
from time to time because of sludge that was dumped off the coast
and then drifted ashore.
   ``Why did you pledge a clean ocean to the people of New Jersey
when your own state applied to pollute it?'' Bush asked.
   While Dukakis applied in 1985 to have his state's sludge dumped
106 miles off the New Jersey coast, a later agreement allowed
Massachusetts to unload it farther out to sea, beyond the
continental shelf.
   Earlier in the week, Bush sailed into heavily polluted Boston
Harbor and accused Dukakis of neglect and stalling and doing too
little to clean up the waters of his own home port.
   The vice president appears intent on wooing members of Dukakis'
own Greek-American constituency. A Bush campaign official tried
without success to recruit an employee of the federally financed
Voice of America to translate the GOP candidate's speeches and
statements into Greek.
   The employee, George Bistis, did not accept the offer, and the
VOA general counsel warned in a memorandum that any VOA staffer
taking such an assignment would be violating the Hatch Act, which
bars federal workers from taking part in partisan political
campaigns.
   ``I find it highly objectionable that any political organization
should feel free to fish around in the VOA for translators of
partisan political material,'' Andreas Antypas, deputy chief of
VOA's European division, wrote in a memo obtained by The Associated
Press.

   Playing a good guy is something new for actor
John Mahoney, who has been in a veritable movie whirlwind for the
last year.
   The actor has turned up as the sinister judge in ``Suspect,''
the drink-splashed teacher in ``Moonstruck,'' a bumbling United
States consul in ``Frantic'' and a white supremacist farmer in
``Betrayal.''
   Now, he is Kid Gleason, the manager of the Chicago Black Sox, in
John Sayles' new movie, ``Eight Men Out.''
   ``He's a very decent man, and I haven't got to play too many of
those,'' noted the Chicago-based actor.
   Mahoney said he isn't certain why he often is cast as an
unsavory character, but thinks it may have something to do with the
role that first brought him to attention in the East.
   His New York stage debut was in ``Orphans,'' in a role that
Albert Finney later portrayed in the film version: ``A man you
could believe could smack you in two if he wanted to, but he was
also a very loving person.''
   After filming ``Eight Men Out,'' Mahoney is back to his old
tricks: playing a father who tries to break up his daughter's
romance in a movie called ``Say Anything,'' and ``a rotten, slimy
character'' in a mini-series called ``Favorite Son.''

   A man drove his estranged wife's
body to police headquarters early Friday and demanded that he be
arrested, authorities said.
   Ruhle T. Pollard, 36, was distraught when he arrived at the
City-County Building about 4 a.m. and told a sheriff's dispatcher
that he wanted to be arrested on an outstanding warrant, said Clark
County Sheriff Mike Becher.
   Dispatcher Harold Goodlet could find no warrant for Pollard and
refused to arrest him. Pollard then told Goodlet to shoot him,
Becher said.
   ``He told Officer Goodlet that if he wasn't going to shoot him
and he wasn't going to arrest him on the warrant, he (Goodlet)
should go out to the parking lot _ that his wife was dead in the
back seat of his car and that he had strangled her,'' the sheriff
said.
   The body of Jo Ann Pollard, 36, was found in the car.
   Pollard was arrested immediately. He was being held on a
preliminary charge of murder, pending a court appearance Tuesday.
   According to the sheriff, Pollard, who is unemployed, had been
living at a shelter for the homeless in Jeffersonville, on the Ohio
River across from Louisville, Ky.
   Lois Nelson, coordinator at the Haven House shelter, said
Pollard had been staying there since the middle of November. ``He
was very cooperative, very quiet. This is quite a shock for me,''
she said.
   Ms. Nelson said Pollard had talked about the separation from his
wife and four children, but had not indicated he was having trouble
dealing with it.
   ``He just said there was a bad situation there and that he just
wanted it to work out,'' Ms. Nelson said.

<TEXT>
   The Adolph Coors Co. and its local
distributor on Friday sued a man who claimed to have found a mouse
in a 16-ounce can of Coors beer.
   The lawsuit filed in Duval Circuit Court accuses James Harvey of
fraud and deceit, product disparagement, defamation and attempted
theft by deception in connection with his claims.
   The lawsuit, which says tests have shown the mouse did not enter
the can at the brewery, also accuses the Jacksonville man of
``intentional interference with advantageous business
relationships.''
   No specific cash amount is demanded in the suit.
   ``What has happened to Coors should not happen to anyone,'' said
Cary Baird, a Coors spokeswoman at company headquarters in Golden,
Colo.
   ``The public recognition of Coors' commitment to quality
products and consumer satisfaction is the company's most valuable
asset, and Coors, and its Jacksonville distributor, Neal Tyler and
Sons, have incurred severe damage as a result of this incident,''
she said.
   Coors would have no further comment on the incident until the
matter is settled in court, she added.
   Harvey, whose telephone number is unlisted, could not be reached
for comment, and his attorney Gary Pajcic was out of town and
unavailable.
   Harvey, 30, a construction worker, has said he purchased a can
of Coors July 27 at a Jacksonville liquor store, took a few sips
and became ill.
   On Aug. 3, Harvey took the can to the Jacksonville Health
Department to have the lid removed, and a six-inch mouse was
discovered.
   After Harvey reported the find to Coors, the company offered him
$1,500 for the can and its contents so they could be analyzed.
   Harvey refused, demanding $30,000 to $50,000, Coors said.
   Coors sued Harvey for the right to analyze the can and its
contents, and a judge ordered an autopsy on the mouse and allowed
Coors to take the can to Colorado for tests.
   Ms. Baird said Aug. 18 that an examination of the mouse by a
University of Florida veterinary pathologist found the animal had
been dead for only a short time, while the beer can had been sealed
in Colorado 77 days before the rodent was found.
   She said that proved that the mouse did not get into the can at
the brewery. The UF examination also noted abrasions on the mouse's
sides.
   A pathologist hired by Pajcic said the assumptions made by Coors
on the basis of the autopsy were not necessary correct, and that
the alcohol in the beer could have preserved the mouse, thus making
it impossible to determine when it died.

<HEAD>Sandinista Leader Says Rebels Beaten But U.S. Threat Remains</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S.-backed rebels have been
defeated but the Sandinista government will maintain its large army
because of the threat of an invasion by American troops, the
defense minister said Friday.
   Humberto Ortega said the rebels are ``strategically defeated''
but the government will not reduce it 80,000-member Armed Forces,
the biggest in Central America.
   ``We can't have a lesser level,'' he said, citing the presence
of rebel units across the border in Honduras and what he called the
threat of U.S. military intervention.
   Ortega said the rebels, known as Contras, were in an
``irreversible situation'' with no hope for victory.
   The Contras began fighting the leftist government in 1981. The
Sandinistas came to power in July 1979 in the civil war that ousted
President Anastasio Somoza after 42 years of rule by the Somoza
family.
   Ortega spoke with reporters after addressing a crowd of soldiers
at an Army Day ceremony. With him at San Jacinto, 25 miles north of
the capital of Managua, were his brother, President Daniel Ortega,
Vice President Sergio Ramirez and Agrarian Reform Minister Jaime
Wheelock .
   The defense minister said the rebels still hoped to obtain
renewed U.S. military aid, cut off at the end of February, and that
the Reagan administration was attempting to provoke a conflict
between Honduran and Nicaraguan troops to justify direct American
military intervention.
   The United States sent more than 3,000 soldiers to Honduras in
March in response to a Sandinistas border crossing into Honduras,
but then withdrew the troops.
   Enrique Bermudez, a Contra directors, said Friday that a loss of
U.S. support for the rebels ``could mean the blood of American
soldiers.''
   A transcript of a rebel Radio Liberaction broadcast quoted
Bermudez as saying the Contras ``are fighting for democracy in
Central America.''
   Most of the rebels fled during the past four months across the
northern border to base camps in Honduras. Washington provides
non-lethal aid to the Contras at the camps.
   The Sandinistas and the Contras signed a cease-fire pact March
23. But high-level talks to work out the mechanics of a permanent
truce in the 7-year-old war stalemated in June. Both sides accuse
the other of violating the March agreement to suspend offensive
military operations.
   The defense minister said that the Sandinistas were ready to
renew the talks but that they had to be held in Managua, the
capital. The Contras refuse to return to Managua, saying they were
barred from circulating freely.
   Humbero Ortega repeated the Sandinista government's estimate
that there are 6,000 Contras and he said 70 percent of them were in
Honduras. Rebel officials say more than 10,000 combatants are in
Honduras and about 2,000 remain in Nicaragua.

   The Contras released a letter to the Sandinistas on
Friday agreeing to continue the Nicaraguan truce past its formal
Aug. 31 expiration date.
   The Sandinistas had previously announced they would not initiate
any action against the Contra rebels, although both sides have
accused each other of violating the truce.
   Only four of the Contras' seven directors signed their letter,
dated Thursday and addressed to Victor Tinoco, deputy secretary of
the Sandinista foreign ministry.
   Contra spokesman Jorge Rosales said the other three directors _
including hard-line military leader Enrique Bermudez _ were out of
town.
   The truce was originally declared earlier this year to permit
peace talks between the two sides. But the Contras have refused
further meetings inside Nicaragua, as the Sandinistas wanted, and
the talks are at a standstill.

   Police seized seven tons of hashish in
the Barcelona port Friday and broke an international smuggling ring
by arresting 14 people, including an American, at Beniform down the
Mediterranean coast, police said.
   It was Spain's second-largest hashish seizure, according to
police and the civil governors of Alicante and Barcelona.
   Police said authorities in Barcelona removed the hashish from a
ship container, then put the container under surveillance and
police followed two men who took it south to Benidorm by truck.
   Virginio Fuentes, provincial governor of Alicante, said 12
Britons, an American and a Norwegian were arrested but he did not
give their names.
   Ferran Cardenal, civil governor of Barcelona, said the drugs
arrived Aug. 18 from Pakistan and the ring intended to distribute
most of it in Britain. He said the hashish was from Afghanistan.
   Cardenal said the ringleader was believed to be Louis King, a
34-year-old Briton, but police had not finished determining the
identities of those arrested.
   The largest hashish seizure in Spain occurred July 24 when
police uncovered 17 tons in a specially built vault on a cove near
Lloret del Mar, north of Barcelona. Six people were arrested.
   Spain has become a major entry point to Western Europe for
hashish traffickers.

<HEAD>Dakota Men Calendar Sponsors Accused Of Fraud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB IMRIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sponsors of a calendar that featured
photos of young, single Dakotas farmers squandered profits on
parties rather than keeping a promise to funnel money to
financially strapped farmers, the state attorney general said
Friday.
   A lawsuit filed in state district court accused the sponsors of
the ``Dakota Men'' calendar of fraud. It seeks to stop sales of the
calendar's 1989 edition, freeze the assets of the sponsors'
corporation and stop the corporation from claiming non-profit
status, said Attorney General Nicholas Spaeth.
   He said an audit of the sponsors organization turned up ``some
very questionable transactions.''
   ``It is clear that a lot of this money went for elaborate
parties, (at) which Dakota Men were present, (and) a lot of food
and liquor,'' Spaeth said at a news conference.
   ``It is clear that, at best, this organization and its
principals never made any serious effort to fulfill any charitable
purposes,'' Spaeth said.
   One of the defendants, Roger Jaeger, denied wrongdoing in a
telephone interview Friday from the group's office in Fargo. Jaeger
is former head of the sponsors' non-profit corporation, FOOD Inc.,
or Farmers of Ongoing Determination.
   ``We have been operating a good business,'' Jaeger said.
   FOOD was started in 1986 to solicit charitable contributions to
raise money to retrain displaced farmers, help them deal with the
stress of tough times and make grants for such things as food and
clothing, Spaeth said.
   A letter printed on the cover of the 1989 calendar, which sells
for $8.95, claims the corporation has ``returned money to farm
relief organizations helping farmers cope with the stress of their
business and providing scholarships, job retraining, and immediate
food, clothing and shelter.''
   But evidence indicates the calendar's sponsors personally
profited by the sales, Spaeth said. He also alleged the sponsors
used a California company to skim off some of the profits.
   The lawsuit seeks restitution for all ``misappropriated money,''
which Spaeth said could total as much as $40,000.
   Defendants in the lawsuit include FOOD and Lawrence Jaeger,
Roger Jaeger, Perry Miller, Ruth Elbert and Karen Tyndall.
   The Jaegers and Elbert are siblings, said Spaeth, who called the
defendants a ``very, very tight-knit group of people.''
   For the year ending in April, FOOD earned $175,508 in total
revenues, but no money was contributed to charity, Spaeth said.
Since April, FOOD has given $2,000 to the North Dakota Mental
Health Association, Spaeth said.
   Roger Jaeger said Friday his organization had made no other
contributions. ``That is getting at questions I can't answer at
this time. There is a reason.''
   The calendars feature a farmer, from North or South Dakota each
month. Jaeger is ``Mr. February'' on the 1988 calendar. The
accompanying copy beneath his photo says in part: ``Look deep into
his eyes, and you see a man who appreciates women, honesty,
dependability and a good reputation.''
   Evidence indicates that Tyndall set up her own company in
California, KMGL, and arranged for FOOD to buy the Dakota Men
calendars from it, Spaeth said.
   ``In reality, KMGL did nothing other than subcontract the work
out to a California printing company,'' Spaeth said.
   Tyndall billed FOOD for $60,226, while work done by the printing
company cost $52,306, he said.

   U.N. officials said Iraqi Kurds occupied the
organization's London office Friday, accused Iraq of using chemical
weapons against them and demanded help, but police said they
understood the Kurds were invited in.
   A Scotland Yard spokesman said late Friday police were told
lengthy discussions took place inside the U.N. office and the Kurds
left peacefully after several hours.
   Eric Jensen, U.N. information director in London, said about 20
Kurds arrived Friday morning and gave him a petition accusing Iraq
of the attacks and asking help from Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar. He said they refused to leave.
   The Kurds, representing a coalition called the Iraqi Kurdish
Front in Britain, occupied the reception area of the U.N. offices
in Buckingham Gate, near Buckingham Palace, Jensen said.
   Perez de Cuellar left the U.N. office in Geneva on Thursday and
was traveling in Portugal on Friday, Jensen said. The
secretary-general has been mediating peace talks between Iraq and
Iran in Geneva.
   In New York, U.N. spokeswoman Nadia Younes said Perez de Cuellar
had received cables from Kurdish groups and that U.N. officials
were studying the messages. She declined further comment.
   There have been several reports of Iraq using chemical weapons
against the Kurds and Iran. Iran has supported the rebels, who live
in the mountainous northern region of Iraq and are fighting for an
independent homeland.
   Amnesty International, the international human rights
organization, accused Iraq on Friday of a ``systematic and
deliberate policy'' to ``eliminate large numbers of Kurdish
civilians.''
   Iraq has acknowledged using chemical weapons in the 8-year-old
war with Iran, but claims Iran used them first.

   An Eastern Express plane had to abort its
takeoff when it hit and killed two deer that bounded out of the
woods adjacent to a runway, an official said Friday.
   Neither the pilot nor the co-pilot of the twin-engine Beechcraft
turboprop was injured in Thursday night's incident at the Hancock
County Regional Airport, said airline spokesman Steve Mason.
   No passengers were aboard the 19-seat plane, which was bound for
its home base in Portland.
   As the plane went down the runway, one deer hit the plane's
propeller and a second hit the nose of the plane, Mason said.
   ``The deer just came so quickly and they (bounded) out of
nowhere,'' he said.
   The impact disabled the plane, which slid along its nose for
``some distance'' before coming to a stop, Mason said.
   Damage to the landing gear, propellers and front end was
``substantial,'' he said, adding that the plane was undergoing
repairs Friday.
   Mason said a deer was killed in a similar fashion a few years
ago.

   A television station Friday accidentally
broadcast an emergency bulletin, prompting immediate calls from
viewers, an official of the station said.
   Oran Gough, director of operations for Fox Broadcasting Co.
affiliate WTTE, said the bulletin telling viewers to stand by for
emergency information ran for about 30 seconds before it was
disovered.
   ``A guy put the wrong tape in the machine,'' Gough said.
``Obviously, we didn't do it on purpose.''
   Gough said the message, broadcast during the movie ``Send Me No
Flowers,'' is a standard emergency announcement that television
stations are required to have as part of the Emergency Broadcast
System.
   The message includes the phrase ``Stand by for emergency
information.''
   Gough said the announcement was interrupted when the mistake was
discovered, and the station resumed the movie with a superimposed
message that the bulletin was broadcast in error.
   He said he did not know how many people called the station.
   ``We got calls from people right after it happened. They wanted
to know for sure that it wasn't for real,'' he said.

   A train caught fire in a tunnel outside

   They said rescue operations lasted nearly four hours due to
thick smoke in the 3.7-mile tunnel. The fire occurred when the
train was about 200 feet from the mouth of the tunnel, according to
the police.
   Authorities said most of the injuries were minor.
   The three-car train was carrying 100 people when fire broke out
in the first car and then spread to the second car, the authorities
said.
   The train was operating between the Catalonian towns of Molins

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II told a group of U.S.
bishops Friday that the Roman Catholic church is determined to help
fight discrimination against women and his own document on women's
dignity will be released soon.
   Receiving 22 bishops from the West and Southwest, the pope noted
the American bishops have prepared a draft of a pastoral letter on
women and he praised them for ``rightly striving to help eliminate
discrimination based on sex.''
   ``Throughout the whole church a great prayerful reflection still
remains to be made on the teaching of the church about women and
about their dignity and vocation,'' the pope said.
   John Paul's document is expected to be released after he returns
from a trip to Africa later this month.
   ``The church is determined to place her full teaching, with all
the power with which divine truth is invested, at the service of
the cause of women in the modern world _ to help clarify their
correlative rights and duties, while defending their feminine
dignity and vocation,'' the pontiff said.
   ``The importance of true Christian feminism is so great that
every effort must be made to present the principles on which this
cause is based, and according to which it can be effectively
defended and promoted for the good of all humanity.''
   The draft of the U.S. pastoral letter, titled ``Partners in the
Mystery of Redemption, A Pastoral Response to Women's Concerns For
Church and Society,'' was issued in April.
   A final draft is expected to be presented to the full body of
U.S. bishops in November 1989 and, if approved, would become part
of their teachings.
   The pope also urged the bishops, at the Vatican for a periodic
visit, to defend the family, in particular from drug trafficking
and pornography.
   ``Both of these plague society, debase human life and human love
and violate human rights,'' John Paul said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, on
Friday announced his his support of Roman Catholic calls for
Christians to boycott a new American film about Jesus Christ.
   But a conservative London newspaper praised a ruling by a senior
government law officer that the film, ``The Last Temptation of
Christ,'' does not violate Britain's blasphemy law.
   ``Christians have been under attack for almost 2,000 years,''
the Daily Telegraph said in an editorial Friday. ``It is not
emphatically a faith so shallow as to be put at risk by the
frivolity of Hollywood.''
   The film, which has raised angry protests in Britain, the United
States, and other places, includes a scene in which Christ
hallucinates about marrying prostitute Mary Magdalene .
   The movie by Martin Scorsese has been playing to packed theaters
in the United States. It is due to be screened in British movie
theaters starting Sept. 9.
   Runcie, the spiritual head of the Church of England and 70
million Anglicans worldwide, said Friday that parts of the movie
cause ``great offense and distress.'' He said there were ``sensible
arguments for wishing the film wasn't shown in this country.''
   Asked about a call last month by Cardinal Basil Hume, the eader
of 5.2 million Catholics in England and Wales, for Christians to
avoid the movie, Runcie said: ``I think that is a reasonable
position, and I would support him.''
   Runcie spoke at London's Heathrow airport on his return with his
wife Rosalind from a vacation in the United States.
   He told reporters he had not seen the film while in the United
States but said, ``I have been reading the newspapers sometimes on
holiday, and obviously there is much debate about it.
   ``I don't think that I shall see it (in Britain) .... It's not
something that I want to see on the basis of what I've read and
heard about it.''
   A senior government official, Director of Public Prosecutions
Allan Green, ruled Thursday that the movie does not violate
Britain's blasphemy law.
   Activists opposed to the movie have said they will continue
trying to get it banned in Britain.
   Mary Whitehouse, president of the National Viewers and Listeners
Association, has said she would try to persuade local authorities
to block screening of the movie. Theaters around the country
operate under a system of local licencing.

   A sobbing mother warned U.S. marshals Friday
not to harm her son, who remained a fugitive three days after a
federal court ordered him returned to jail on hostage-taking
charges.
   Eddie Hatcher, 30, an American Indian, is accused with Timothy
Jacobs, 20, of taking up to 20 people hostage Feb. 1 at the offices
of The Robesonian newspaper in Lumberton, in what they said was a
protest of alleged corruption and discrimination against minorities
by Robeson County law enforcement officials.
   The siege ended after 10 hours when Gov. Jim Martin agreed to
form a state task force to investigate their allegations.
   Hatcher failed to surrender at the U.S. Marshal's office in
Raleigh when his bond was revoked Wednesday, and a federal arrest
warrant was issued Thursday, said Chief Deputy Dwight Rich. Jacobs
surrendered Wednesday.
   ``If anything happens to my son, I will hold the federal
government responsible,'' Hatcher's mother, Thelma Clark, said at a
news conference outside a hospital where she underwent back surgery
this week.
   Mrs. Clark said her son had followed the terms of his $100,000
bond before it was revoked. ``He kept all the rules they gave
him,'' she said. ``He is not a criminal.''
   Hatcher and Jacobs spent five months in jail before a
three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in
June they had not been given a bond hearing soon enough after their
arrest.
   Hatcher and Jacobs were denied bond twice by a U.S. magistrate
and once by a U.S. District Court judge. They were ordered back
into custody when the entire appeals court agreed to reconsider the
case at the request of Assistant U.S. Attorney John Bruce, who
challenged the terms of their release.
   A lawyer representing Hatcher said Friday he has asked to have
the federal warrant revoked because it was issued without a hearing
and prosecutors had not demonstrated that Hatcher posed a danger to
the community while free on bond.
   ``He lived where he was supposed to, honored his curfew and
travel restrictions, reported religiously to the probation office
(and) submitted to urinalysis,'' attorney Barry Nakell said at a
news conference in Carrboro, near Chapel Hill.
   Nakell refused to comment on whether he had spoken with Hatcher
since the arrest warrant was issued or knew of his whereabouts.
   But he said he was confident Hatcher would show up for his
scheduled Sept. 19 trial ``if he is alive and well. He was very
anxious for this trial.''

<TEXT>
   Oral Roberts University has reduced
scholarship funds available to medical students and eliminated
salaries for graduates who serve as medical missionaries for the
university.
   The move is the latest modification in the medical missionary
program that was the object of evangelist Oral Roberts' widely
publicized 1987 fund-raising effort, in which he claimed he might
die if donors didn't come forward.
   Under the revised scholarship program, first-year medical
students are no longer eligible for scholarship aid offered to
those who plan to become missionaries.
   Other medical students who sign contracts promising to work as
missionaries are to receive up to $20,000 in scholarship aid while
they are in school, university officials said Thursday. Previously,
participants were eligible for up to $24,000.
   In addition, the students will no longer be eligible for $22,000
salaries after graduation, when they do the missionary work.
   In January 1987, donations to the medical missionary scholarship
program were falling when Roberts issued a nationwide plea for $8
million. He said if he did not raise the money by April 1, 1987,
God would ``call me home'' to heaven.
   Although Oral Roberts officials announced the goal was met,
Roberts discontinued the scholarship program a year later amid much
criticism. Three months after that, he reinstated it.
   Students who withdraw from the program may continue to attend
Oral Roberts, said Dr. Larry Edwards, dean of the medical school.
But they have to pay back whatever has been given them in
scholarship money.
   The medical student scholarship program was begun as a pilot
project for a few students in 1985. At the end of last semester,
105 students were receiving scholarships.
   The school now has 168 medical students enrolled, including 46
first-year students.
   The first-year students are not being offered scholarships,
Edwards said, because officials want to get to know them during
this school year to make sure they are truly called to be
missionaries before offering aid.

   Four hostages and heavily armed police
SWAT teams spent several tense hours Friday waiting out two holdup
men, until the hostages safely made a break for it and police
discovered the pair had fled.
   The hostages spent 3{ hours inside a closet believing the holdup
men were still in the bank, then dashed from the building in a bid
for freedom, police said. No one was hurt.
   Heavily armed officers had spent the morning assuming the four
bank employees were being held hostage. After the four ran out,
officers fired two rounds of tear gas into the bank, searched it
and found no one inside.
   ``It's ironic the way it worked out,'' said Officer Douglas R.
Anderson of the Metro Police Department. ``We were here to play it
out until the end. We don't feel silly.''
   An all-points bulletin for two men was issued when police came
out of the downtown bank branch around noon without the suspects.
   The four hostages _ three women and a man _ were being debriefed
Friday afternoon at police headquarters.
   Police did not know how the two burglars were able to enter the
Third National Bank through a broken rear window without triggering
an alarm.
   The bank employees told police one man carried a sawed-off
shotgun and the other had a knife, Anderson said.
   Police said they did not know if any money was taken.
   The FBI tried to communicate with those inside by using a
bullhorn, Anderson said, but received no response. Telephone calls
to the bank during the four hours went unanswered.
   The four employees ran from the one-story granite building and
were hustled into a police mobile command unit and whisked away.
   Anderson said the burglars apparently were already in the bank
when the workers arrived about 7:30 a.m. The burglars forced them
into the closet, then apparently fled after another bank worker
arrived, saw something was going on and went to a nearby business
and called police.
   ``It was a burglary, and they came in to wait for an armed
robbery,'' Anderson said.
   Meantime, the employees in the closet did not know the intruders
had left and remained there until their break for freedom.
   About 25 police officers and FBI agents surrounded the building
and stood atop nearby businesses. Traffic on two streets was
blocked off for three blocks.
   The bank employees were identified as bank manager Lattie Brown,
45; assistant manager Trina Chance, 40; loan officer Brian
Williams, 27; and teller Dot Oats, 51.

Soldiers</HEAD>

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A radio station on Friday said
soldiers fatally beat an employee of state-run television while he
was being held at an army compound because of a debt to an officer.
   Also on Friday an independent team probing allegations of human
rights abuses in Haiti concluded its visit.
   Radio Soleil said Schubert Baptiste, 30, a messenger employed by
Televison Nationale, was beaten to death during his detention at
the Dessalines Barracks. That is the headquarters of Haiti's most
feared army unit.
   Radio Soleil, a station operated by the Roman Catholic church,
quoted Baptiste's wife as saying Baptiste was arrested Aug. 20 for
failing to repay a $1,000 debt to an army officer that the report
identified only as Lt. Metellus.
   The station did not say when Baptiste died. The Press Federation
on Friday protested the death.
   Meanwhile, a five-member team from the Organization of American
States Commission on Human Rights ended a five-day trip after
visiting six detention centers, including the Dessalines Barracks.
   The group also gathered information on the slaying of human
rights activist Lafontant Joseph who was found stabbed to death in
his car on July 11.
   Haiti has been under the military rule of Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy
since June 19 after he ousted civilian President Leslie Manigat.
   ``We were disappointed not to have met with Lt. Gen. Namphy,''
team member Christina Serna told The Associated Press. ``After all,
he has proclaimed himself the champion of human rights.''
   The delegation visited several other towns ``to gather
information on human rights violations in those regions,''
according to an OAS communique that said the group met with several
ministers of Namphy's all-military cabinet.
   Members of the team arrived Sunday night and are to report to
the next session of the OAS General Assembly on Nov. 14.
   It was the first mission by an OAS team to Haiti since January
1987, when Namphy led a provisional government set up after
President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to France on Feb. 7, 1986,
ending a 29-year family dictatorship.
   Namphy relinquished power on the second anniversary of
Duvalier's flight, but returned in a bloodless coup that ousted
Manigat. More than a dozen Manigat followers were held for several
weeks without charges.
   A day after seizing power, Namphy declared himself president and
abolished the legislature. A month later he suspended the
constitution, which 99 percent of Haitian voters approved in a
March 1987 referendum.

   About 1,200 miners went on strike
higher pay and the dismissal of the mine manager, whom they accused
of corruption, the official news agency Tanjug said Friday.
   It said the strike at the Krupanj antimony mine, 90 miles
southwest of Belgrade, began Thursday after workers asked for their
July pay, which had been withheld for lack of funds.
   Tanjug said average monthly pay at the mine is $80 but did not
say how much more the men were demanding. It gave no details of the
accusations against the manager.
   Striking miners sent a 140-member delegation to the headquarters
of state-run unions in Belgrade to press their case, the agency
said.
   Labor unrest has grown in Yugoslavia in recent years because of
a decline in living standards resulting from austerity measures
imposed in an attempt to revive the faltering economy and deal with
a $21 billion foreign debt.

<HEAD>Exiled Chilean Artists Now Can Work at Home</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDUARDO GALLARDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Critics accused President Augusto
Pinochet on Friday of lifting the exile ban only to gain votes, but
whatever the motive, many Chilean artists and performers will be
able to work in their own country.
   Gen. Pinochet, who seeks to win eight more years in office as
the sole candidate in a presidential referendum Oct. 5, announced
Thursday that all 430 remaining political exiles may come home.
   One daughter of the late President Salvador Allende, overthrown
in the coup led by Pinochet in September 1973, already has returned
and Allende's widow and other daughter have said they will come
back.
   Among other people affected is Miguel Littin, an acclaimed movie
maker whose ``Acts of Marusia'' was nominated for an Academy Award
as the best foreign film of 1985. Littin and thousands of other
Chileans went into exile soon after the coup.
   It will not be Littin's first return. He spent several weeks
here in 1986 shooting scenes for a documentary on Chile, but he was
disguised, used an assumed name and posed as a member of an Italian
television crew.
   That film, ``General Act of Chile,'' is critical of the Pinochet
militry regime and has been shown at several European movie
festivals.
   An account of the secret visit was written later by Colombian
author Gabriel Garcia Marquez, a Nobel laureate and close friend of
Littin.
   Garcia Marquez wrote that Littin visited several Chilean cities
and on one occasion stood only a few yards from Pinochet while
filming a ceremony.
   On Friday, the Santiago newspaper La Epoca quoted Littin as
saying by telephone from his home in Madrid that he would return to
Chile ``in the next few hours, or in a week.''
   Littin now is shooting ``Sandino,'' a film about the late
Nicaraguan revolutionary leader Cesar Augusto Sandino with American
actor Dustin Hoffman playing the role of Sandino.
   Also expected to return is Helvio Soto, a movie maker who has
had been working in Paris.
   Two folk groups noted for protest songs, Inti Illimani and
Quilapallun, have performed successfully in Europe for years.
   Inti Illimani, now based in Rome, was on a U.S. tour when
Pinochet made his announcement.
   Quilapallun is based in Paris. It was not known if either group
planned to return.
   Patricio Manns, a folk musician who lives in Switzerland, also
can come back. In 1986 he became an ``international spokesman'' for
the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front, Chile's main leftist
guerrilla group.
   Manns announced in Europe that the guerrillas claimed
responsability for the Sept. 6, 1986, attempt to assasinate
Pinochet, the army commander. The president escaped harm in the
ambush of his motorcade on a road in the Andes foothills near
Santiago but six bodyguards were killed and 11 wounded.
   La Epoca quoted Manns, also a poet and author, as saying he had
not decided whether to return and wanted ``security guarantees''
from the government.
   The Chilean Journalists Association said 32 journalists are
among the exiles affected. They include Jose Miguel Varas, a
communist who lives in Moscow and broadcasts a daily radio program,
``The Voice of Chile.''

   Relatives of Americans who died in the Soviet
downing of a Korean airliner on Friday called for a full
congressional investigation into unanswered questions still
surrounding the 1983 tragedy.
   ``It would be a dangerous precedent to let this matter fade into
oblivion,'' said Nan Oldham of Bethesda, Md., co-chair of a family
members' organization, at a news conference marking the fifth
anniversary of the air disaster.
   The Sept. 1, 1983, downing of Korean Airlines Flight 007 claimed
the lives of all 269 people aboard, including 63 Americans.
   The Korean jet, which had strayed more than 350 miles off
course, was shot down after passing over Soviet territory while on
a flight from Anchorage, Alaska, to Seoul, South Korea.
   Mrs. Oldham, who lost her 27-year-old son, John, told reporters:
``We feel betrayed by our government whose silence in this case,
rationalized by the questionable claim of national security
concerns, is beginning to resemble a deliberate cover-up.''
   ``It is fitting, indeed imperative, for Congress to conduct a
full-scale investigation,'' she said. ``Armed with its subpoena
power and the right to examine more than 1,200 still-classified
documents, Congress can uncover the truth.''
   Mrs. Oldham cited a March 9 letter from Sens. Edward M. Kennedy
and John F. Kerry, both D-Mass., to Sen. Wendell H. Ford, D-Ky.,
requesting an investigation by Ford's Commerce subcommittee on
aviation. The letter was subsequently referred to the Senate
Intelligence Committee.
   The Soviets officially have said they shot the plane down
because they believed it was a U.S. reconnaissance aircraft
violating Soviet airspace.
   In their letter, Kennedy and Kerry pointed to a number of
unresolved matters involving the Korean airliner affair.
   _``It is our understanding that there is evidence showing that
an hour and a half into the flight, the FAA (Federal Aviation
Administration) controller in Anchorage, Alaska, knew that KAL 007
was off course and heading for Soviet airspace, that he considered
warning the aircraft but refrained from doing so.''
   _``There is also reason to believe that important evidence has
been tampered with, that U.S. records were destroyed and that U.S.
and Japanese tapes of communications with the airliner were
falsified.''
   _``In addition, it is our understanding that there are two
contradictory sets of radar tracks, both attributed to U.S. radars
... showing KAL 007's course. One of them must be false,'' Kennedy
and Kerry wrote in the letter.
   Joan Piermarini, a staff member of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said she had no comment on prospects for an
investigation by the panel.
   Earlier Friday, about 100 family members attended an interfaith
memorial service at the Washington Cathedral, which included a
reading of the names of all 269 victims, who came from 17 different
countries.
   Among those giving brief eulogies at the service was Lois Bowden
of AuGres, Mich., who lost her mother, Eleanor Bissell.
   ``Five years have passed and I have not come to terms with her
death,'' Mrs. Bowden said.
   She added that ``I will not be able to close the book of her
life'' until the questions surrounding the tragedy have been
resolved.
   Nancy Draughn of Lake Charles, La., called the loss of her
20-year-old daughter, Sarah, ``a tragedy so powerful that it would
change the course of my life.''
   ``We cannot end (grieving) until we have used this tragedy to
make a better and safer world,'' she said.
   Julia Lombard of Hatboro, Pa., a Philadelphia suburb, fought to
hold back tears as she recalled the loss of her husband, Aiden, and
her brother-in-law, Donald.
   ``How can we explain to our kids what we don't even know
ourselves?'' said Mrs. Lombard, who has four children.
   Another family member, Canadian Philippe Robert de Massy, said,
``It may be that we will never know everything that happened.''
   De Massy, who lost his younger brother, Francois, said the
tragedy had brought home to him the need for ``a new ethical order
in the relationships between people.''

   U.S.-backed Angolan rebels said Friday
they shot down a Soviet-built MiG-23 fighter jet, killing its Cuban
pilot, and killed 65 government soldiers, losing five of their own
men.
   In neighboring South-West Africa, the military said Friday eight
pro-independence rebels were killed on the first day of a voluntary
cease-fire in the South Africa-controlled territory. South Africa
claims the rebels have no intention of observing the truce.
   U.S.-supported rebels of the Union for the Total Independence of
Angola, known as UNITA, said in reports in Lisbon that its
anti-aircraft units shot down the plane down Thursday. They said
the airplane was bombing guerrilla positions in the central Bie
province.
   UNITA, with U.S. and South African support, has been fighting
the Marxist government since independence from Portugal in 1975
under the leadership of Jonas Savimbi.
   It has not been party to U.S.-sponsored talks that brought
Angola, Cuba and South Africa together for negotiations. The rebels
have continued fighting despite a cease-fire signed Aug. 22 by the
three countries and South Africa's withdrawal of its troops to
neighboring South-West Africa.
   Rebels fighting South African soldiers in South-West Africa, or
Namibia, also had played no part in the peace talks but said they
would begin a voluntary cease-fire Thursday.
   The eight guerrillas were killed that day in a skirmish at
Okankolo, a settlement in the north-central part of the territory,
the military said. It gave no report on its own casualties.
   Military spokesmen said the guerrillas were in a group of 30
that entered Namibia from Angola on Aug. 26 ``with the aim of
continuing the organization's armed campaign and intimidation of
the region.''
   ``The continued hostile activities by SWAPO ... indicate that
the organization has no serious intentions of adhering to (the
cease-fire),'' a statement said.
   Also Thursday, a bomb at a Windhoek Hotel killed two people and
injured 15. South Africa's chief representative in the territory,
Louis Pienaar, blamed the blast on SWAPO, the South-West African
People's Organization. The rebels denied it.

   President Amin Gemayel blocked a move
Friday to reinstate a Moslem-led Cabinet in an action that could
enable him to put a Maronite Christian in charge.
   Immediately after the announcement by the presidential office
Christian and Moslem militiamen clashed with machine guns,
rocket-propelled grenades and 106-mm recoilless cannons across
Beirut's dividing Green Line, police said. There was no immediate
report of casualties.
   Gemayel rejected the move earlier in the day by Acting Prime
Minister Salim Hoss to withdrew his Cabinet's resignation. Hoss
said he was withdrawing the resignation to avert a power vacuum if
Parliament fails to elect a new president in the next three weeks.
   ``We inform you that we have withdrawn the Cabinet's
resignation, which had been announced by the late Premier Rashid
Karami,'' Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, said in a letter to the Christian
president.
   Karami, also a Sunni, was killed in a helicopter bomb explosion
June 1, 1987, 28 days after he announced the resignation of his
half-Moslem, half-Christian Cabinet.
   After Karami's assassination Gemayel named Hoss acting prime
minister of the caretaker Cabinet.
   The presidential palace issued a communique Friday rejecting
Hoss' move. The move would leave Gemayel free to name a new interim
Cabinet led by a Christian if no new president is in place before
his term ends later this month.
   The developments came during a crisis between pro-Syrian
leftists, Moslem factions and right-wing Christians over the
election of a new president. When the Cabinet initially announced
its resignation it accused Gemayel of leaning too much toward
Israel.
   Parliament failed Aug. 18 to muster the needed quorum of 51
members to elect a president. Syrian-backed warlord Suleiman
Franjieh, 78, was the only serious contender.
   Franjieh's backers have accused the right-wing Christian
Lebanese Forces militia of forcefully preventing deputies from
attending the parliamentary session.
   The Lebanese Forces denied the charge and said the boycotters
opposed Franjieh's candidacy.
   A Lebanese Forces spokesman, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, has said: ``There will be no quorum as long as Franjieh
remains a candidate.''
   Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite Moslem, adjourned
the Aug. 18 session without setting the date for a new meeting to
elect a head of state.
   The independent daily paper An-Nahar said Gemayel would form an
interim Cabinet headed by a Maronite Catholic if no president was
elected by Sept. 23, when his six-year term expires.
   Hoss' move also appeared designed to block such an attempt by
Gemayel.
   According to an unwritten national covenant dating to Lebanon's
independence from France in 1943, the president should be a
Christian, the prime minister a Sunni and the house speaker a
Shiite Moslem.
   ``The formation of a new Cabinet in the present critical
political situation would lead to risky consequences,'' Hoss said
in his letter to Gemayel.
   He said the formation of a Cabinet headed by a Maronite prime
minister would derail the presidential elections.
   Lebanon's Syrian-backed Moslem and leftist factions also have
told Gemayel not to form a Christian-headed Cabinet. It said such a
move would rekindle the 13-year-old civil war, which has claimed
more than 130,000 lives.
   Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon. It maintains 40,000
troops in eastern and northern provinces as well as west and south
Beirut.

coast of Mexico.
   Over 3 inches of rain fell in Galveston, Texas, on Friday
morning.
   Showers and thunderstorms also continued from southwest Kansas
through western Oklahoma into west-central Texas.
   A fire station in Odessa, Texas, measured over 6} inches of rain

   Temperatures Friday afternoon were in the 70s or 80s across much
of the nation. Readings were in the 60s as cooler air came in
behind a front in the northern Plains. Temperatures were also in
the 60s because of clouds and rain from the southern Rockies into
southwest Kansas and the Texas Panhandle.
   Temperatures were in the mid-90s over the northern valleys of
California. Temperatures ranged from the mid-90s to 105 degrees in
the desert Southwest.

   The forecast for Saturday called for showers and thunderstorms
along a cold front from the eastern Great Lakes through the Ohio
Valley into Arkansas and northeast Texas. Showers and thunderstorms
were expected from the southern Atlantic states through the Gulf
coast region and much of Texas.
   Near record heat was expected once again over inland areas of
the Pacific Northwest with high temperatures from the mid-90s to
105 degrees. High temperatures were expected in the 80s or 90s
across much of the nation, but in the 70s from the northern third
of the Mississippi Valley through the Great Lakes and the Ohio
Valley and in the upper 60s over northeast Minnesota, northwest
Wisconsin and western Upper Michigan. Highs were forecast between
100 and 110 degrees from the California valleys into the desert
Southwest.

<HEAD>New Brazilian Constitution A Mixture of Nationalism And Liberalism</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts 1 graf after 4th pvs: The lawmakers completed... with

   Lawmakers early Friday finished work on
a new constitution that replaces the authoritarian charter drawn up
two decades ago by military generals.
   The new constitution failed to make major social or economic
changes, such as land reform and curbing the role of the military,
but it legalizes strikes, abolishes censorship, strengthens
Indians' rights and environmental laws, and lowers the voting age.
   ``Brazil is a new country. This constitution will protect the
weak and punish those who abuse power,'' the constituent assembly's
speaker Ulysses Guimaraes said.
   The lawmakers completed the document shortly before 2 a.m. They
had begun work in February 1987, two years after civilian rule
returned to Brazil after 23 years under the military.
   No further action is required for adoption of the constitution.
The document has been sent to proofreaders and it will become
effective Sept. 23.
   The 245-article constitution covers nearly every aspect of daily
life: interest rates, education, health, divorce, Indians' rights,
strikes and minimum wages.
   A first draft had reduced the military's role to basic keepers
of the peace, but rumblings from the still-powerful,
behind-the-scenes generals promoted the armed forces to
``defenders'' against foreign or national threats. The nationwide
Democratic Ruralist Union lobbied hard against land reform. Its
leader, powerful landowner and chiropractor Ronaldo Caiado,
convinced thousands of farmers and rural workers that the
constitution would expropriate ``productive land.''
   Bowing to pressure, legislators excluded productive land from
land reform, unless it produces marijuana.
   In a country where farms are the size of nations and 4 percent
of the 143 million people own more than half the fertile land, very
little land is expected to go to Brazil's 12 million landless
peasants under the constitution.
   President Jose Sarney, who came to power in 1985 in an indirect
electoral college election, ardently fought against a parliamentary
system of government and won a five-year term in office instead of
four. Brazilians haven't voted for president since 1960 and most
polls showed they wanted Sarney, a provincial politician closely
linked to the military, out of office this year.
   Brazilians will vote for a new leader in November 1989.
   New envirnonmental laws are aimed at protecting Brazil's Amazon
rainforest, randomly burned by the landless and speculators.
Indians also gained new rights, including ``exclusive'' use of
their land and resources.
   The constitution also:
   _ Lowers the voting age from 18 to 16 years of age. The only
other country where 16 year olds can vote is Nicaragua.
   _ Legalizes strikes for all workers. Before, ``essential''
sectors of the labor force were not allowed to strike.
   _ Nationalizes mineral mining and gives foreign companies four
years to hand over control to a Brazilian resident.
   _ Bans new oil risk contracts.
   _ Abolishes censorship of films, books and television.
   _ Abolishes the decree law, a powerful tool used by the
president to bypass Congress and push through legislation.
   _ Gives women 120-day maternity leaves and men five-day
paternity leaves.
   The question Brazilians now must wrestle with is how to
implement the constitution in a country with rampant corruption,
runaway inflation and vast economic and social inequality.
   In 1993, Brazilians will vote on whether they prefer a monarch,
prime minister or president to run the country.

   A judge Friday sentenced four polygamist
clan members to minimum prison terms, enraging prosecutors who said
the penalties for a church bombing and fatal police standoff were
too lenient and possibly illegal.
   Chief U.S. District Judge Bruce Jenkins, amid repeated
criticisms of federal mandatory sentencing standards governing
bombings and firearms, said he had no choice but to order prison
terms of 15 years for clan ringleader Addam Swapp and five years
for his mother-in-law, Vickie Singer.
   ``The sentence imposed is not for what you say, not for what you
believe, but for what you did,'' Jenkins told Swapp, who was
seriously wounded in the Jan. 28 shootout with FBI agents that
ended one of Utah's most bizarre church-state confrontations. A
state corrections officer was killed.
   Swapp's brother, Jonathan Swapp, and Mrs. Singer's son, John
Timothy Singer, both 21, each received mandatory 10-year sentences
for a pair of firearms charges and five years' probation for two
other counts. Prosecutors said the maximum penalty for the four
counts was 45 years.
   They said Addam Swapp could have been imprisoned for 75 years
and Mrs. Singer for 50 years for their parts in the Jan. 16 bombing
of a Mormon chapel in Marion and a 13-day siege of their rural
stronghold by 100 officers.
   ``I think once again that everyone involved in this whole
process continues to wonder why it ever occurred,'' Jenkins told
Mrs. Singer, 45, who tearfully implored the judge to free her.
   Jenkins said mandatory sentencing laws imposed by Congress
``illustrate a crisis of the whole sentencing process ... whether
we judge without knowing anything about the case as a matter of
social policy.''
   The sentences and Jenkins' criticisms of Congress infuriated
U.S. Attorney Brent Ward. He said prosecutors planned to appeal the
sentences as illegal since Jenkins simply declined to impose
penalties on some counts and rendered less-than-minimum terms on
others.
   ``I've heard stronger sentencing comments in a drunk-driving
case,'' Ward said, adding he had never been involved in a case
where the sentence was ``given with apologies to the defendant and
criticism of the Congress.''
   ``There's no case I know of that more clearly shows the wisdom
of Congress in imposing minimum sentences,'' Ward said.
   State murder charges in the shooting death of state Corrections
Lt. Fred House, killed in the shootout, were expected to be filed
Tuesday against an unspecified number of the 15-member clan that
included nine children under age 18.
   Swapp said the bombing was ordered by God as a sign of the
impending collapse of the Mormon Church and all government, and
that it would trigger the return of family patriarch John Singer,
slain by police nine years before for resisting arrest. The clan
maintained Singer was killed in a church-state conspiracy and that
the family had been harassed for years by police and neighbors.
   ``I have to call the state of Utah and the United States to
repentance. If they do not repent, they will be destroyed,'' Addam
Swapp, 27, said in court Friday.
   He and the judge discussed the Constitution, the defendant
likening the bombing to the Boston Tea Party. Jenkins ended the
exchange by noting Swapp's intelligence and devotion to his two
wives, Mrs. Singer's daughters, and their six children.
   Jenkins said the case had troubled him. ``It always seemed to me
that this whole episode was an unnecessary episode. If one had
sought redress in appropriate, peaceful ways, there would have been
a forum,'' he said.
   Mrs. Singer, 45, made a plea for mercy saying she didn't want to
be separated from her children.
   The judge said he could not overlook her culpability. ``Mrs.
Singer has to look within herself and recognize that these are
consequences of her own doing, no one else's,'' he said.
   The four clan members were convicted by a federal jury in May of
20 of 23 counts following 13 days of testimony by some 67 witnesses.
   On the eve of his sentencing, Addam Swapp said in a telephone
interview with the Associated Press that God would intervene.
   ``We're going to be delivered. We have received the promise that
we aren't going to prison. To actually say that I will not go into
prison, I really don't know. I do know whatever time they give me,
I'm not going to serve it,'' Swapp said.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa on Friday
pleaded with holdout strikers to return to work at a mine where a
wave of labor unrest began 18 days ago. Poland's prime minister
made a similar mission to a nearby mine.
   In Szczecin, 1,800 dockworkers and 600 bus depot workers offered
to end their strike as soon as job security is guaranteed for the
bus workers, said Interfactory Strike Committee member Artur
Balasz. He said strikers idled since Aug. 17 were awaiting
management's response.
   The end of the Szczecin strikes would leave the July Manifesto
mine in Jastrzebie in southwestern Poland the only facility in the
country still on strike. Workers there left their jobs on Aug. 16.
   Walesa urged strikers at July Manifesto to give up their strike
in exchange for a government promise to begin national talks on
legalizing the trade union Solidarity.
   Walesa's talks with strikers at the mine continued past
midnight. a Polish journalist who asked not to be identified said
there was progress in the negotiations and added, ``Everybody is
waiting for a happy finale.''
   Prime Minister Zbigniew Messner turned up unannounced at the
neighboring Borynia coal mine to discuss workers' concerns, Polish
media said. The mine, within sight of July Manifesto, went on
strike from Aug. 20-24 and labor tensions have persisted there.
   Walesa began talking to strikers at the July Manifesto mine
immediately after arriving in the morning with an aide and his
parish priest, Rev. Henryk Jankowski, said management spokesman
Antoni Pilny. He also spoke at a rally with workers in the
afternoon.
   Pilny later said the strikers were resisting going back to work
until local issues were settled. He said outstanding issues
included guaranteeing strikers' job security, raising pay,
improving working conditions and reinstating fired Solidarity
activists.
   ``The two sides are still locked in debate over the guarantees
of (strikers') personal safety,'' Pilny said. He said he expected a
guarantee to be issued by the police chief and prosecutor.
   Walesa received a telegram from Roman Catholic Bishop Jerzy
Dabrowski in Warsaw promising that the church would defend the
personal and job safety of miners who ended their strikes, Pilny
said.
   A man answering the phone in the mine management building, who
demanded anonymity, said the miners initially refused Walesa's
appeal to end the strike.
   In Gdansk, 700 workers gathered at the port this morning after
management told about 400 involved in the strike action not to
return to their jobs, Gdansk Solidarity spokesman Bogdan Borusewicz
said.
   Management told the workers to file applications for
reinstatement but most of them went back to work, the spokesman
said.
   Strike committee leaders were negotiating with port authorities
to secure formal reinstatement. No agreement had been reached, he
said.
   Walesa called for an end to strikes after meeting Wednesday with
Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak and Alternate Politburo member
Stanislaw Ciosek to discuss Poland's worst labor unrest in seven
years.
   In the meeting _ Walesa's first with with ranking officials in
six years _ the government agreed to discuss legalizing the
outlawed Solidarity trade union movement and other worker issues in
return for an end to the strikes.
   The communist authorities recognized Solidarity in an agreement
signed Aug. 31, 1980, but declared martial law in December 1981 to
suppress the first independent union in the Soviet bloc. Solidarity
was outlawed in 1982.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban praised Walesa's efforts to end
the labor unrest. ``We appreciate any positive and reasonable step.
The appeal to stop the strike is such a step. It should be
especially valued when it comes from a participant in the
strikes,'' Urban said.

   An organization for fat people rallied Friday
for an end to job discrimination against the obese, saying dieting
is not the answer to the problems they face in the workplace.
   Members of the National Association to Aid Fat Americans say
most workers who are overweight have been or will be refused jobs,
promotions or health insurance benefits because of their size.
   ``Should we follow the National Institutes of Health's obesity
panel which says slim down? No. That's not the answer,'' said
member Rosezella Canty-Letsome. ``Should we lobby to (make) weighty
people a constitutionally protected category? Yes.''
   The group is holding a convention in Baltimore through Monday,
and sponsored the rally attended by about 100 people. The
organization, founded in 1969 and based in Herald, Calif., says it
is a human rights organization dedicated to improving the quality
of life for fat people.
   ``You're not at a fat people's rally. You're at a civil rights
rally,'' said Russell Williams, co-chairman of the group's activism
committee.
   Harry Gossett, author of ``Fat Chance,'' a book on
discrimination against overweight people, borrowed from the ``I
have a dream'' speech delivered by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
in Washington 25 years ago.
   ``We have a similar dream, for people to be judged by their
ability and not by their attraction to gravity,'' he said.
   Comparing prejudice against overweight Americans to
discrimination against blacks, Gossett said, ``Today, fat people
are assumed to be inherently ugly, unsanitary, stupid, lazy and
enslaved by creature comforts.''
   The group's president, Nancy Summer, said surveys show that 85
percent of women weighing about 200 pounds or more reported
employment discrimination because of their size. A high percentage
of fat women who have jobs told researchers they feel they are
overqualified for the tasks they are assigned, she said.
   Obese workers are frequently hidden in back offices and given
work that keeps them away from the public, and many are told they
cannot be hired because fat people take too much sick leave and
drive up insurance rates, Ms. Canty-Letsome said.

   A federal judge Friday reimposed potentially
bankrupting fines against Yonkers for defying a court-ordered
housing desegregation plan, then unsuccessfully tried to reach a
settlement in informal discussions.
   U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand, who found the city guilty of
racially segregating housing for 40 years, reinstated the fines
which were upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday night.
   Sand said the Supreme Court decision ``does not alleviate in any
way, indeed one might agree it intensifies, the fiscal crisis that
confronts the city of Yonkers.''
   He added that although the nation's highest court blocked fines
and jail terms for four defiant city councilmen ``they (the
councilmen) still have a responsibility to the citizens they
represent who will bear the brunt of these fines.''
   Because Monday, Labor Day, is a court holiday, Sand ordered the
city to pay $192,000 on Tuesday. As previously promised by Sand,
more than $85,000 of the money due will be earmarked for Yonkers
public schools and to guarantee the payment of interest on city
bonds. The balance of the $192,000 will go to the U.S. Treasury and
is non-refundable.
   Sand then called on lawyers for all parties to immediately meet
with him privately ``to explore informally some ideas we have for a
possible solution of this crisis.'' The talks ended after about an
hour.
   ``It was not successful,'' Mayor Nicholas Wasicsko told
reporters.
   Michael Sussman, attorney for the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, said there was no progress and
called it a ``hostile discussion.''
   ``I haven't changed my position. I will do what I have to do,''
said Henry Spallone, one of the councilman opposed to the
desegregation plan.
   On Aug. 1, the council voted 4-3 against incentives to build 800
units of middle-income housing throughout the city as part of the
desegregation plan ordered by Sand.
   The fine had started at $100 on Aug. 2 and doubled daily until
it was stopped after a week pending appeals. The city has paid
$12,700 and was to resume paying at $12,800 on Friday until the
fine reaches $1 million a day and stays there, growing in
million-dollar jumps.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo said he would direct the city's Emergency
Financial Control Board on Tuesday to begin making the substantial
reductions in city spending and services that will be required by
Sand's order.
   The control board, which assumed management of Yonkers' finances
Aug. 9, passed a resolution the same day saying it would seek the
criminal charges against the four councilmen if the fines were
reinstated. The charges stem from violating the control board act _
a state law _ by jeopardizing the city's fiscal condition.
   Cuomo said last week he would initiate removal proceedings
against the four councilmen if the fines were reimposed.
   However, Cuomo spokesman Gary Fryer said Friday that for the
time being, the governor would not attempt to oust the recalcitrant
councilmen.
   The high court's ruling was ``raising more questions about
removal than already existed and there were already many
questions,'' Fryer said.
   The Supreme Court ruled late Thursday night to stay a lower
court ruling that upheld contempt citations against the four
councilmen, who had been paying $500-a-day fines and would have
been subject to imprisonment this weekend.
   The court ``has granted the stay for the four council members''
until they have had time to ask the court formally to fully review
their cases, U.S. Supreme Court spokeswoman Toni House said
Thursday night.
   ``The application so far as the city of Yonkers is concerned has
been denied,'' she said.
   Even with the $1 million daily fine cap, Yonkers, the state's
fourth-largest city with a population of 200,000 people just north
of New York City, would be bankrupt by November, officials said.
   House said the entire court considered the applications, and
Justices Thurgood Marshall and William Brennan filed a 12-page
dissent.
   ``As the city repeatedly points out in its application, `Yonkers
is relatively unique in that most of the governmental power in the
city is centralized in the legislative branch.' For this reason the
city IS the council,'' Marshall wrote in arguing that all the stays
be denied.
   Wasicsko, who favors complying with Sand's housing desegregation
order, said the decision troubled him.
   ``The treasury of the city is going to be exposed and the
taxpayers of the city are going to feel the burden,'' he said.
``One thing it denies is the political martyrdom of the councilmen.
They were slated to go to jail on Sunday. Their personal fines have
ceased. But the city is going to plummet to bankruptcy. So their
onus is their duty to the city.''
   Two of the four, Nicholas Longo and Vice Mayor Henry Spallone,
called the decision a ``great victory.''
   But Councilman Peter Chema, another of the four, called the
decision ``a big personal victory, but I have serious concerns
about the city.''
   ``It's kind of like being administered oxygen while someone
strangles you,'' said Chema.
   ``The relief becomes moot if he decides to bankrupt the city in
the interim,'' Longo said.
   The fourth councilman, Edward Fagan, called the decision
``unexpected'' and declined to comment further.

   U.S. Ambassador Clyde Taylor on Friday
finished his three-year assignment here during which he was accused
of meddling in Paragay's internal affairs and was once tear-gassed
at a garden party.
   Before boarding the plane, Taylor acknowleged having contacts
with people and organizations Gen. Alfredo Stroessner's government
considers subversive, but added: ``We never aligned ourselves with
any group.''
   He said the goal of U.S. policy is ``that Paraguay continue
being a stable country. ... Thinking of the future, five or 20
years after Stroessner, is to think of a transition with someone
who knows how to promote development and democracy and justice,
without violence.''
   Stroessner, 75, seized power in 1954 and has ruled this
landlocked South American nation since with the support of the army
and the Colorado party.
   Taylor's replacement, Timothy Towell, is to arrive next week in
Asuncion.
   The departing ambassador told foreign reporters: ``When I got
here, it was taboo to talk of anyone replacing the president. Now,
everything has changed. President Stroessner, like all of us, is a
little older and I see it as a good step that he himself talks
about his succession.''
   Relations between Taylor and the general's authoritarian
government became uneasy soon after the ambassador arrived in
November 1985. The 50-year-old career diplomat, whose parents were
Calvinist missionaries, traveled through the country advocating
human rights and meeting with opposition groups.
   He pressed for the reopening of ABC Color, Paraguay's biggest
newspaper, which was closed in 1984 for printing articles the
government considered subversive.
   Taylor also had asked the government to track down the source of
a signal that jammed broadcasts by Radio Nanduti, the country's
most popular station before it was forced off the air.
   Allegations about his conduct ranged from interfering in
domestic politics to conspiracy and subversion. Interior Minister
Sabino Montanaro said last year Taylor was close to being declared
``persona non grata.''
   Police fired tear gas at a garden party given in his honor in
February 1987, but Taylor continued to press for human rights and
speak his mind _ including a hint in February 1988 that government
officials might be involved in drug trafficking.

   Critics accused President Augusto
Pinochet on Friday of lifting the exile ban only to gain votes, but
whatever the motive, many Chilean artists and performers will be
able to work in their own country.
   Gen. Pinochet, who seeks to win eight more years in office as
the sole candidate in a presidential referendum Oct. 5, announced
Thursday that all 430 remaining political exiles may come home.
   One daughter of the late President Salvador Allende, overthrown
in the coup led by Pinochet in September 1973, already has returned
and Allende's widow and other daughter have said they will come
back.
   Among other people affected is Miguel Littin, an acclaimed movie
maker whose ``Acts of Marusia'' was nominated for an Academy Award
as the best foreign film of 1985. Littin and thousands of other
Chileans went into exile soon after the coup.
   It will not be Littin's first return. He spent several weeks
here in 1986 shooting scenes for a documentary on Chile, but he was
disguised, used an assumed name and posed as a member of an Italian
television crew.
   That film, ``General Act of Chile,'' is critical of the Pinochet
militry regime and has been shown at several European movie
festivals.
   An account of the secret visit was written later by Colombian
author Gabriel Garcia Marquez, a Nobel laureate and close friend of
Littin.
   Garcia Marquez wrote that Littin visited several Chilean cities
and on one occasion stood only a few yards from Pinochet while
filming a ceremony.
   On Friday, the Santiago newspaper La Epoca quoted Littin as
saying by telephone from his home in Madrid that he would return to
Chile ``in the next few hours, or in a week.''
   Littin now is shooting ``Sandino,'' a film about the late
Nicaraguan revolutionary leader Cesar Augusto Sandino with American
actor Dustin Hoffman playing the role of Sandino.
   Also expected to return is Helvio Soto, a movie maker who has
had been working in Paris.
   Two folk groups noted for protest songs, Inti Illimani and
Quilapallun, have performed successfully in Europe for years.
   Inti Illimani, now based in Rome, was on a U.S. tour when
Pinochet made his announcement.
   Quilapallun is based in Paris. It was not known if either group
planned to return.
   Patricio Manns, a folk musician who lives in Switzerland, also
can come back. In 1986 he became an ``international spokesman'' for
the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front, Chile's main leftist
guerrilla group.
   Manns announced in Europe that the guerrillas claimed
responsability for the Sept. 6, 1986, attempt to assasinate
Pinochet, the army commander. The president escaped harm in the
ambush of his motorcade on a road in the Andes foothills near
Santiago but six bodyguards were killed and 11 wounded.
   La Epoca quoted Manns, also a poet and author, as saying he had
not decided whether to return and wanted ``security guarantees''
from the government.
   The Chilean Journalists Association said 32 journalists are
among the exiles affected. They include Jose Miguel Varas, a
communist who lives in Moscow and broadcasts a daily radio program,
``The Voice of Chile.''

   A judge Friday reversed her order that a teen-age
mother who left her two sons alone in a sweltering apartment for
three days, practice birth control throughout her child-bearing
years, saying it was unenforceable.
   Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Lindsay Budzyn had
sentenced Debra Ann Forster on May 24 to lifetime probation with
the birth-control stipulation.
   At a hearing earlier in the week, Ms. Budzyn refused to revoke
the probation even though she learned that Mrs. Forster, 18, is
pregnant with her fourth child. She said Mrs. Forster's pregnancy
didn't mean that the court's orders had been ignored, since no
method of birth control is foolproof.
   Mrs. Forster pleaded guilty in April to two counts of attempted
child abuse stemming from a May 1987 incident in which she left her
two sons, William, 1{, and Scott, 6 months, alone in a Mesa
apartment for three days. Authorities said the apartment had no air
conditioning, and both babies were dehydrated and near death when
found.
   The judge said at Forster's sentencing that the birth control
stipulation was the only way to make sure Mrs. Forster did not have
other children to abuse.
   Ms. Budzyn's ruling Friday came on motions filed by defense
attorney Garrett Simpson, Mrs. Forster's public defender, and
attorney Colin F. Campbell, representing the Arizona Civil
Liberties Union, to modify the terms of probation by deleting the
birth-control requirement.
   Campbell argued that the order was invasive, amounted to cruel
and unusual punishment and violated freedom of religion for Mrs.
Forster, a Roman Catholic.
   In her ruling Friday, Ms. Budzyn wrote the birth-control
requirement was being lifted because of ``its inability to be
enforced.''
   Instead, the judge ordered that Mrs. Forster undergo urinalysis
testing for drugs every two weeks; enroll in a comprehensive
counseling program including individual counseling and classes in
parenting skills, prenatal care and birth control; receive marriage
counseling; and have a complete assessment of her medical condition
at the time of the delivery of her child.
   While awaiting trial this year, Mrs. Forster gave up the rights
to her sons and a daughter who was born in jail. According to court
records, all three have been adopted.

<HEAD>Benton Skeptical Of Bakker's Offer</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Gives first reference to bankruptcy trustee in 2nd graf</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By G.G. RIGSBY</BYLINE>

   The bankruptcy trustee for the PTL
religious complex said Friday he's ``very, very skeptical'' about
whether founder Jim Bakker will come up with the cash to back up
his $165 million offer for the ministry.
   M.C. ``Red'' Benton told The Associated Press in a telephone
interview from his Winston-Salem, N.C., home that he thinks the
former television evangelist does have a financial commitment from
28 Greek businessmen who are supposed to be backing the deal.
Bakker has not identified those businessmen even to Benton.
   But he said Bakker seems to be having some trouble getting the
cash into the United States. Benton had said Thursday that he
expected Bakker, who founded the television ministry and theme park
but then left after admitting to extramarital sex, to sign a
contract to buy PTL on Friday morning.
   But the money was not available and legal details were not yet
worked out, so Benton extended the deadline until Tuesday morning.
   Bakker lawyer Ryan Hovis of Rock Hill, who met with PTL
bankruptcy lawyers Friday at PTL's Heritage USA park, said there
were no ``serious snags'' in the negotiations and that a $3 million
letter of credit to back up Bakker's offer would be available by
Tuesday.
   Hovis said the reason the contract wasn't signed Friday morning
as previously announced is that a lot of legal details must be
taken care of for such a large purchase.
   PTL lawyers who met with Hovis on Friday declined comment on the
negotiations.
   Benton said if the money isn't available by Tuesday, he'll be
forced to consider other bids for the ministry's assets. He said
offers of $120 million, $125 million and one ranging from $150
million to $200 million have been made, as well as Canadian real
estate executive Peter Thomas' standing offer of $113 million. He
declined to elaborate.
   Benton has a deadline of Sept. 10 to recommend a buyer to U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds.
   ``We can't present anything to the judge if we do not have full
and complete assurance that he (Bakker) can fulfill the
commitment,'' Benton said. ``I am very, very skeptical about
whether he'll come up with the money.''
   Reynolds has not indicated when he will choose a buyer for PTL,
but he has said during court hearings that he's anxious to pay
creditors and to keep Heritage USA operating.
   Any involved parties could appeal Reynolds' choice of a buyer to
U.S. District Court.
   Benton said his job is to secure the deal that will pay the most
money to creditors, not to determine Bakker's chances of success.
   Benton said if Bakker does come up with the cash and secures the
deal, he thinks things will be different this time around.
   ``I think he would have a financial watchdog to keep him out of
trouble,'' he said. ``I really think he's learned his lesson.''
   Bakker told The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer on Thursday that he's
confident his new ministry _ New Covenant Partners Inc. _ will
succeed.
   ``I see it as a chance to do some of the things better where
I've made mistakes and wrong decisions,'' Bakker said. ``There will
strict financial controls to make sure PTL lives within its
budget.''

   Most alligator hunters were disappointed
after the first day of Florida's month-long gator season, but by
Friday morning some lucky ones bagged animals as long as nine feet.
   Thursday at sunset marked the beginning of the first legal
alligator hunt in 26 years for the lucky _ or not-so-lucky _ 230
people granted permits to catch the reptiles with harpoons, nooses,
crossbows and almost anything but a gun.
   The first night of the 30-day hunt netted about 130 alligators
in 28 designated hunting areas across the state, according to the
Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission. Thirty-eight were
bagged in the Everglades, while 36 were taken in the Lake
Okeechobee area, a spokesman said.
   Two novice hunters, David and Jerry Navin, snaked through a Dade
County canal in the darkness looking for the red-reflecting eyes
that give away the swimming reptiles, but the gators refused to
cooperate.
   ``There's a few here, but they're not really doing what they're
supposed to,'' chuckled David Navin. ``They're a little tougher
than we thought.''
   His brother Jerry called their experience ``on-the-job
training.''
   To the north on Lake Okeechobee, one of the designated hunting
areas, some gator pursuers reported better luck.
   Thomas Alpern, 25, of Brooklyn, N.Y., the only northerner
receiving a permit, bagged a nine-footer despite worrying
beforehand that he might be unable to kill the animal even when he
captured it.
   With gator hides selling for $42 a foot and meat running up to
$6 a pound, Alpern and others persevered, though few expected to
bag their 15-gator limit the first night.
   Hide and meat sales from a single alligator can total $300 to
$500.
   ``We're having fun,'' said Bud Wolfe, an alligator hunter from
Oakland Park. ``Where else but in Africa can you go after a
500-pound animal that can kill you?''
   Early success came to Carlos Donate of Miami and his guide, Jay
Medore of Clewiston. They snagged a 8-foot-3-inch animal only 80
minutes after they started hunting on Lake Okeechobee.
   Once they got the gator reeled up to the side of the boat, they
shot it with a ``bang stick,'' a firearm-like gadget that is
allowed under the game commission rules.
   ``We blew one hell of a hole in his head,'' Donate said. ``It
was exciting.''
   He then taped the gator's mouth shut.
   ``It's scary putting that tape on his mouth, even with a hole in
his head,'' he said.
   Doug Mackie and Steve Prater, who work for the city of Pembroke
Pines' utilities department, bagged a 6-foot alligator and another
that was 8 feet or longer.
   Prater showed how he hooked one just beside the alligator's left
rear leg with a large hook on a heavy-duty saltwater fishing rod.
He said fighting the gator when it was hooked was very difficult,
and he snapped the heavy fiberglass rod.
   ``It was a deep-sea rod and it just plain snapped in two,'' he
marveled.
   Alligator hunting was outlawed in Florida in 1962 because
wildlife biologists feared overhunting of the ancient reptiles
might threaten the survival of the alligator.
   A small alligator industry has built up in recent years because
alligators have increasingly become problems by turning up in urban
areas and pestering and occasionally killing humans or their pets.
   Estimates place the current number of alligators living in
Florida at 1 million, and game commission officials said they are
now far from an ``endangered'' species.

   A spokesman for Kurdish rebels fighting
Iraqi government troops said Friday the Iraqi army slaughtered
about 1,300 unarmed men, women and children this week.
   Kurdish refugees in a camp in Turkey said they fled on foot from
Iraqi chemical bomb attacks that killed about 500 people in their
group.
   In London, the human rights group Amnesty International said
Friday that Iraq had used chemical weapons in a military campaign
against Kurdish villages that has left hundreds of civilians dead.
   The London-based group accused Iraq of a ``systematic and
deliberate policy'' of killing Kurds.
   The reports were among many recent accusations of Iraqi
atrocities against Kurds, who are fighting for an independent
homeland in northern Iraq.
   The Iraqi News Agency quoted an ``official source'' as denying
chemical weapons were used in northern Iraq. The source identified
the Kurds who are fleeing into Turkey and Iran as ``traitors'' who
collaborated with the Iranian ``invaders'' during the eight-year
Persian Gulf war.
   Iraq launched a major offensive against the rebels after
accepting a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire in the war last month.
   Both the Turkish and Iranian governments have reported the
arrival of thousands of Kurds. In Turkey, Premier Turgut Ozal said
Thursday that 60,000 refugees had arrived since the country opened
its borders two weeks ago.
   The official of the Kurdish Democratic Party told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview that soldiers arrested the victims
in the Dahuk region in northwestern Iraq, killed them, then buried
them in mass graves Sunday.
   He also said the Iraqi military was holding back 43,000 people
trying to flee the region.
   The report could not be independently confirmed. The spokesman,
based in a West European capital, has given information to the AP
on several other occasions. He declined to give his name for
security reasons.
   Iraq's 3.5 million Kurds have been waging their separatist
struggle on and off for 50 years.
   Iran has supported the Kurdish rebels in their fight against
Iraq. The rebels estimated Wednesday that 60,000 troops backed by
fighter-bombers and helicopter gunships were fighting them.
   One of the refugees in Turkey, 64-year-old Salih Zaid, said
three bombs fell near his group them as they prepared to leave
their village.
   ``I fainted, and when I came to I saw that my daughter and two
sons were dead,'' he said.
   Zaid said he was partially blinded by gas with a garlic-like
smell that he claimed was mustard gas. The United Nations has said
that Iraq has in the past used mustard gas, which is
distinguishable by its garlic-like smell.
   The refugees, most of them from Zakho and Duhok townships in
northern Iraq, said they walked north for three days to reach the
Turkish border after the Iraqi army launched an offensive, heavily
bombing their settlements in the last week of August.
   ``We were under constant bombardment all during our trek. About
500 people from our original group of 10,000 died before reaching
the Turkish border,'' said Aziz Taha, 25, a university student who
was in his hometown, Duhok, when the Iraqi assault started.
   In other reports, the Iranian government-run Islamic Republic
News Agency quoted Kurdish refugees in Iran as saying their
villages were destroyed by Iraqi forces.
   ``My house has been set on fire three times ...,'' IRNA quoted
Iraqi villager Hakim Refaq, 42, as saying.
   The party spokesman said fighting between the Kurdish rebels and
the Iraqi army was escalating. The army used chemical weapons to
attack three villages in the Amadiyah area Wednesday and Thursday,
he said.
   ``We call upon the United Nations and the international
community to intervene and stop this war of genocide against our
people,'' he said.
   On Friday, U.N. spokeswoman Nadia Younes said in New York that
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar had received cables from
Kurdish groups and that U.N. officials were studying them.
   About 20 million Kurds live in the mountains where the borders
of Turkey, Iran and Iraq meet. Syria and the Soviet Union also have
small Kurdish enclaves.

   Lottery machines spewed out tickets by
the millions Friday as players scurried for a chance to win
Saturday's world-record $52 million Lotto jackpot.
   Tickets were selling at a rate of about 265 per second, said Ed
George, spokesman for the Florida lottery.
   For the day, 7.5 million tickets at $1 apiece had been sold by 5
p.m., compared to 4.9 million at the same time last Friday when the
jackpot was $32 million. The jackpot has been climbing because no
one has won since Aug. 6.
   Fridays are the lottery's second-biggest sales day. A full 50
percent of any week's sales are made on Saturdays through 10:30
p.m. when computerized ticket machines shut down for the 11 p.m.
drawings.
   Last week some 32 million tickets were sold. This week,
officials expected sales to hit 40 million.
   It took Florida only four months to break the world record for a
Lotto prize, which California set in June with a $51.4 million
prize that was shared by two winners. Florida launched its Lotto
game in April.
   In spite of the 14-million-to-one odds, the record-jackpot was
attracting players from bordering states in large numbers, lottery
officials said.
   Eight of the state's top 10 retailers, measured by ticket sales,
are located in Panhandle or northeast Florida counties bordering
Alabama and Georgia, neither of which has a legalized lottery, said
George.
   ``We do know that our border retailers are very heavy,'' said
George. ``Any one of those retailers will tell you what the tags
are on the cars in the parking lots.''
   The lottery's telephone hotline has been receiving calls from
out-of-state residents wanting to buy tickets without coming to
Florida. But because Postal Service regulations prohibit the sale
of the lottery tickets through the mail, people must visit Florida
to buy their tickets or have someone buy them.
   ``We've got so many people running in and out of here. I had
somebody call at 6 o'clock this morning wanting to know if I was
open,'' said Bill McMurtray, manager of a convenience store and
service station in Bradfordville, about eight miles south of the
Georgia border.
   Lotto players select six numbers from one through 49, mark their
selections on a computer card, which is read by a ticket machine.
   The $51.4 million California prize had been the world record,
according to Terri La Fleur, a senior editor at Gaming and Wagering
Business Magazine, a monthly trade publication in New York.
   Sam Valenza, publisher of Lottery Players magazine in
Moorestown, N.J., agreed with La Fleur. Spain's ``El Gordo''
lottery gave away $56 million in 1983, but it was not a Lotto-style
jackpot.

<TEXT>
   Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis jibed
at both men on the Republican ticket Friday, labeling George Bush a
dropout on education and ridiculing the idea of Dan Quayle leading
the war against drugs.
   Speaking to an enthusiastic, flag-waving crowd, Dukakis asked,
``Is there anybody here today, is there any citizen in the United
States of America, who thinks that Dan Quayle is qualified to be
the nation's drug czar?''
   The crowd of 2,000 to 3,000 people in a public park erupted in
hoots and cheers.
   Dressed in shirtsleeves on a bright, sunny day in which the
temperature headed toward 100 degrees, the Massachusetts governor
noted that Bush had said he was going to put his vice president in
charge of the war against drugs.
   ``Ronald Reagan tried that and it failed,'' Dukakis said.
   He also stressed the schools issue, a recurring theme of his
speeches during a pre-Labor Day campaign swing up the West Coast.
   ``The future will depend, above all, on the quality of education
we provide,'' Dukakis said.
   He accused the Reagan administration of seeking to cut funds for
remedial programs and teacher training while he had worked to
bolster such programs in Massachusetts.
   Then he asked what Bush, who says he wants to be known as the
``education president,'' was doing at the time.
   ``I guess he just dropped out,'' Dukakis said.
   In Spokane, Wash., Dukakis kept up his attack on Quayle, saying
at a rally at a steelworkers' union hall: ``Isn't it nice to have a
Democratic nominee for vice president whose qualifications have
never been questioned by anybody?''
   The Portland crowd, which included some anti-abortion
demonstrators, was one of the most enthusiastic to greet Dukakis
during the campaign, and he had little trouble drawing partisan
responses to his punch lines.
   Several times the crowd picked up the chant, first heard at the
Democratic convention in Atlanta, of ``Where was George?'' _ a
reference to Democratic claims that Bush tried to dissociate
himself from such controversial Reagan administration activities as
arms sales to Iran.
   The crowd also loudly booed a reference to President Reagan's
Star Wars plan for a space-based missile defense system.
   In another cut at Quayle, Dukakis said that in a Democratic
administration, ``we're going to have a vice president who's been a
leader in the United States Senate.''
   In contrast to Quayle, a 41-year-old senator from Indiana,
Dukakis' running mate, Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, is one of the
Senate's senior members.
   Dukakis appeared in Portland only hours after announcing that
John Sasso, forced to resign a year ago as campaign manager, would
return with the title of vice chairman.
   Sasso left the campaign on Sept. 30 because of his involvement
in distribution of a videotape demonstrating that Sen. Joseph Biden
of Delaware, a Dukakis rival for the Democratic nomination, had
incorporated language by a British politician in his own speeches
without giving credit.
   Dukakis was introduced at the rally by Oregon Gov. Neil
Goldschmidt, who said Dukakis ``has set the standard for every
governor in the country.''
   As for the Republican nominee, Goldschmidt said, ``With George
Bush, what you see is all that you get.''
   In Spokane, Dukakis toured a Kaiser Aluminium Co. plant and gave
his standard ``good-jobs-at-good-wages'' stump speech at the union
hall.
   Later, at the airport, asked again about Sasso's return, Dukakis
replied: ``He is a very talented person. ... John didn't do
anything that was illegal or dishonest. It was a mistake in
judgment.''

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Nine Arrested In Zia Crash Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An air force squadron leader and
eight other people were arrested in connection with the plane crash
that killed President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, a published report said
Friday.
   Jang, an Urdu-language daily, quoted ``informed sources'' as
saying the nine were arrested Thursday night at Islamabad Airport,
which doubles as a military airbase.
   It did not name the suspects, identify them further, say where
they were held or detail their alleged involvement in the case. It
said one was an air force squadron leader.
   Government offices were closed Friday, the Moslem Sabbath, and
officials were not available for comment.
   Zia's personal C-130 transport plane took off from Islamabad on
Aug. 17 to the southeastern city of Bahawalpur, where he watched a
demonstration of the U.S. M-1 Abrams battle tank.
   The four-engine turboprop exploded after takeoff on the return
flight and crashed. All 30 people aboard were killed, including
Zia, U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphel and several top generals.
   Previous reports said more than 20 Pakistanis have been arrested
in the crash investigation, which government officials said is
focusing on sabotage.
   Jang said an airport security officer and some civilian aviation
officials had also been detained but were released before the
Thursday arrests.
   No formal charges have been filed.
   Pakistani newspapers have carried unsourced reports that
investigators suspect the plane either had a bomb on board or was
hit by an anti-aircraft missile. U.S. teams are assisting in the
probe, but officials said no cause has been determined.
   A Cabinet minister, meanwhile, told senators Thursday night that
Zia was aware that a certain foreign country had formed a hit list
of top Pakistanis in order to create chaos.
   Mohammed Aslam Khattak, whose portfolio includes communications
and railways, said the list included Zia, himself and ``the leader
of a political party.''
   He apparently was referring to opposition leader Benazir Bhutto,
head of the Pakistan People's Party.
   Ms. Bhutto said police have posted armed guards at her Karachi
villa since Zia's death.
   Khattak did not say which foreign country was involved, but
officials have blamed a series of terrorist acts over the past two
years on Soviet-trained agents of Afghanistan's communist
government.
   Pakistan backs Moslem guerrillas fighting to oust the
Afghanistan government and the Soviet troops who support it.

   A Navy officer's court-martial in the
drowning of a rescue-swimmer recruit proved that the recruit's
rights were violated, regardless of the innocent verdict, the
victim's family said Friday.
   A panel of four officers late Thursday found Lt. Thomas A.
Torchia, former officer in charge of the Navy Rescue Swimmer
School, innocent on two dereliction-of-duty charges after a
seven-day trial.
   Torchia was in charge of the school at Pensacola Naval Air
station on March 2 when Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki, 19, of
Appleton, Wis., died in a training pool after suffering a
fear-induced heart attack.
   Witnesses testified that instructors threw Mirecki into the pool
and that one held his head under water after the panic-stricken
recruit climbed out and shouted that he wanted to ``D-O-R,'' or
drop on request, Navy jargon for quitting the voluntary training.
   ``My brother's rights to DOR were totally violated without a
doubt,'' said his sister, Lynn Johansen, of Appleton. ``The law was
broken according to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. That
comes out loud and clear.''
   Mrs. Johansen and her husband, Larry, sat through most of the
trial. Mirecki's mother, Elaine Kitowski, of Manitowish Waters,
Wis., and her husband, Mel Kitowski, also attended.
   ``It is a very stressful thing for our family to be here,'' Mrs.
Johansen said. ``The verdict is not the most important thing for
us.''
   Most important, she said, is finding out how her brother died.
Family members declined to express an opinion on the verdict, but
said they were satisfied with the prosecution of the case, led by
Lt. Cmdr. Larry Wynne.
   Mrs. Kitowski said she believed the court-martial panel thought
the defendant's ignorance of what the instructors were doing to her
son was insufficent reason ``to make him a criminal.''
   Torchia testified he was on the telephone in his office
overlooking the pool but neither heard nor saw anything to indicate
something was wrong. If present, he said, he would have stopped the
instructors.
   Torchia, 32, of Princeton, Ill., said he intended to continue
his Navy career as an aviation maintenance officer.
   Mirecki's family is staying in Pensacola for the court-martial
of a second defendant, Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael W. Combe,
28, of Tempe, Ariz.
   Combe, an instructor, is charged with involuntary manslaughter,
battery and conspiracy to commit battery charges. He is accused of
holding Mirecki's head under water.
   A five-member panel of officers was seated Friday night to hear
the case, beginning Tuesday. Also, a motion to dismiss the charges
was denied by the military judge who has handled both trials. Cmdr.
Newell D. Krogmann made a similar ruling in the Torchia case.
   Defense lawyer W.H.F. Wiltshire of Pensacola argued that Vice
Adm. N.R. Thunman, chief of naval education and training, was
unqualified to convene the court-martial because there was an
appearance he had a personal interest in the outcome of the case.
   He contended Thunman's interest stemmed from the adverse
attention his command has received as a result of the death.
   Wynne argued against the motion, saying that extending
Wiltshire's theory up the chain of command would prohibit anyone,
including the chief of naval operations, from convening a
court-martial in such a high-visibility case.
   Thunman testified Wednesday that he had wanted to correct what
he said were erroneous press reports that the Navy failed to begin
investigating the case until receiving outside pressure from the
victim's family, their congressman and the media.
   He also was concerned about initial reports released by Navy
spokesman who incorrectly said the death was from natural causes.

   President Alan Garcia appointed a new economy
minister and also changed four other Cabinet posts, the government
said Friday, in the struggle to combat inflation.
   The National Statistics Institute said Friday that consumer
prices increased 243 percent from January through August, the
biggest such rise in Peruvian history.
   The Cabinet shakeup was the fourth in the three-year-old Garcia
government.
   Energy Minister Abel Salinas was appointed late Thursday to
replace Economy Minister Cesar Robles, who resigned, according to
the official gazette El Peruano.
   Jorge Carrasco, a congressional deputy and president of the
Chamber of Deputies' Energy Commission, was named to head the
Energy Ministry, according to the report.
   Late Friday, Garcia named Justice Minister Camilo Carrillo to
head the Transportation Ministry, replacing Francisco Maury, who
resigned, and Sen. Cesar Delgado was named justice minister.
   Ivan Garcia, president of the state steel company Sider Peru,
was appointed to replace industry minister Guillermo Arteaga who
left the Cabinet.
   Garcia, head of the center-left Aprista Party, said other posts
in the 15-member Cabinet would not be changed.
   The five ministers were sworn in to their posts late Friday,
according to the government.
   Robles was the third economy minister in Garcia's government and
served only three months.
   Manufacturing has continued to decline and shortages of basic
consumer goods are widespread. The 39.9 percent cost of living
increase in July was the highest one-month total in Peruvian
history.
   The National Statistics Institute said in a statement published
in Friday's gazette that prices increased 21.7 percent in August
over July and the total for the year so far was 243 percent.
   Government officials have said inflation may reach 400 percent
for all of 1988 but independent analysts predict at least 500
percent. The previous high was 158.3 percent in 1985 and the
inflation rate for 1987 was 114.5 percent.
   Analysts said Salinas is expected to introduce new austerity
measures.

   Port workers who ended their strike after
appeals from Solidarity leader Lech Walesa called a rally today to
protest alleged bad faith by the government. Walesa urged workers
at seven other enterprises to end strikes.
   A Solidarity spokesman said the walkout at the July Manifesto

be nearing an end.
   The Gdansk workers planned to protest outside the port, said
Antoni Graberczyk, a member of the port strike committee. Some

   Investigators are pointing to possible
problems with Delta Flight 1141's engine thrust and wing flaps
before it crashed on takeoff, and they hope to get answers from the
crew and their recorded cockpit conversations.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators said Thursday
a flap indicator handle in the wrecked cockpit was found in the
wrong position for most takeoffs, raising questions whether the
plane's wing flaps were set properly.
   Incorrectly set flaps led to the fatal crash of a Northwest
Airlines flight last summer. The Delta Air Lines flight's indicator
handle, however, could have been accidently jarred during or after
the crash, investigators said.

   A ``gung-ho'' Navy lieutenant accused of
dereliction of duty in the drowning of a rescue-swimmer trainee was
acquitted in the court-martial he sought in an effort to exonerate
himself.
   ``All I can say is the military (justice) system worked,'' a

``The system that charged me found me innocent.''
   A four-officer panel found the 32-year-old Princeton, Ill., man
innocent of two counts of dereliction of duty after deliberating 3{
hours in the weeklong trial. Torchia was in charge of the Navy
Rescue Swimmer School at the Pensacola Naval Air Station when
Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki, 19, of Appleton, Wis., died March 2 in

   Unemployment climbed to 5.6 percent in August
as the number of jobless Americans grew by 226,000 and a four-month
hiring boom in the nation's factories ended abruptly, the
government said Friday.
   Stock and bond prices soared on the news, and analysts said the
softening job market was just the ``cold shower'' than an
overheating economy needed. They predicted it will keep a lid on
inflation and interest rates through the November elections.
   The 0.2 percentage point rise from July's unemployment rate of
5.4 percent was characterized by 5,000 layoffs in a manufacturing
sector that had put 130,000 more workers on their assembly lines in
the previous three months in response to surging foreign demand for
U.S. exports.

   What's in a name, you ask? At the
Edinburgh Festival, a lot.
   With 913 shows on the unofficial Festival Fringe competing for
theatergoers' time and money, participants found it's the name of
the event, not necessarily the work itself, that often is the thing.
   ``If it's an unknown play, the name can make people look
twice,'' playwright Eleanor Zeal said of her show ``The Tainted
Honey of Homicidal Bees,'' just one of numerous Fringe offerings
whose title immediately catches the eye.
   Indeed, visitors to the 42nd Festival Fringe, which ended on
Sept. 3, and which played alongside the Scottish capital's
higher-profile mainstream cultural binge, are besieged by any
number of suggestive, pun-filled or just plain odd titles chosen to
make one event stand out from the next.
   This year's entries ranged from take-offs on popular movies:
There's both a ``Futile Attraction'' and a ``Fatal Distraction,''
based on the box-office hit ``Fatal Attraction,'' as well as a
``Jean de Toilette,'' based on the critically acclaimed ``Jean de
Florette.''
   There also are Shakespearean send-ups such as ``Not Much of
Ado'' and ``Jesus Christ! It's Julius Caesar.'' Any title is
permissible on the Fringe as long as it's not libelous.
   Trisha Emblem, the Fringe assistant administrator, defined a
good title as one that's ``memorable, even if it's nothing witty.''
She cited ``The Life and Times of Hieronymus Bosch'' as a title
that was effective because of its distinctiveness.
   Sometimes, people don't realize how distinctive their title is.
   ``We didn't actually choose it to cause a stir,'' said Carolyn
Davies, co-director of ``Straight Laced, Jo Orton't, Jo Shouldn't,
Jo Wouldn't, Jo Couldn't, Jo Didn't,'' a satirical comedy that had
this year's longest name.
   ``We all sat around and thought, `OK, what are we going to call
it?' And suddenly, it arrived,'' Davies recalled, aware that length
has its disadvantages.
   ``We couldn't fit the name on the tickets,'' she said, ``but
it's on all the posters and leaflets.''
   One playwright was worried his title was too distinctive.
   ``I have a feeling a lot of people are going to say it's
strident,'' Simon Harries said of the title to his show ``Hold Your
Horses, Mussolini,'' a comedy with music and dancing about one King
Zog of Albania.
   But Harries, a 36 year-old marketing director who last wrote a
Fringe play 10 years ago, stood by his choice: ``It's honest; it
really does say what you need to know about the play. It's
immediately arresting and surprising.''
   And what if the title's good but the play itself isn't? All
agreed that there's the rub.
   ``There has to be something behind a title, an interesting
concept in the play itself,'' said Trisha Emblem.
   Speaking by telephone from his office in London, Simon Harries
said, ``I shall be there (in Edinburgh) every day ... talking to
people to find out why they came to see my show.''

<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Having made films about political
violence on three continents, Greek-born filmmaker Costa-Gavras now
turns his attention to racial terrorism in the United States.
   The movie is ``Betrayed,'' in which Debra Winger portrays an
undercover FBI agent who becomes the lover of Tom Berenger, a
Midwest farmer who leads a paramilitary white supremacy sect. The
story begins with the murder of a controversial radio talk-show
host and includes the robbing of banks to finance the movement.
   Once again a Costa-Gavras film has paralleled news events. His
most famous films portrayed U.S. involvement in the overthrow of
Chile's military regime (``Missing''), and military despotism in
Greece (``Z''). He has also dealt with torture in Latin America in
``State of Siege,'' Eastern Europe Stalinism in ``The Confession''
and the Palestinian issue in Israel with ``Hanna K.''
   Costa-Gavras, who has lived in France for many years, is no
stranger to controversy. He recently talked with accustomed
frankness about his work and politics during a visit to California
for the Hollywood opening of ``Betrayed.''
   Q. Is there something unique about racism in the United States?
   A. Here it's different. The expression of racism is probably
much more violent. The ideology of racism is the same everywhere,
unfortunately.
   Q. Did you do a lot of research for ``Betrayed''?
   A. Yes. The moment I started to do the movie, which means three
years ago, I started doing research in the different fields. You
find everything in television or in books or in newspaper
interviews. It's extraordinary; everything is there. I saw hours of
tapes.
   A lot of things happened during and after my research. Howard
Beach happened while I was researching. Then the Bernhard Goetz
story. All those things are extraordinary. I think the last 10-15
years is a kind of wave of racism.
   (Costa-Gavras was referring to a Dec. 20, 1986, incident in the
Howard Beach section of Queens, N.Y., in which a group of young
whites beat and chased some blacks, resulting in the death of one
black. Goetz, who is white, was convicted in June 1987 of a weapons
violation in the New York subway shooting of four black youths he
said he thought were going to rob him.)
   Q. Do you think racism has become more prevalent than before?
   A. Yes, I think so. I do not know the reasons. I try to
understand why. I think it always was there, somehow. But people
feel authorized to express themselves much more openly.
   Q. The most shocking scene in ``Betrayed'' is when the farmers,
armed with automatic guns, stage a kind of nighttime foxhunt of a
young black. Do you think that could happen in this country?
   A. No, I don't have any direct evidence that it happened. What
I'm trying to do there is make the scene as strong as possible,
just to show how unbearable, how frightening can be racist murder.
... I don't see much difference between killing a man on the street
because he is black or has a different religion, or hunting him. I
tried to dramatize how unacceptable that can be.
   Q. Why did you choose Debra Winger?
   A. Debra has the quality of being a strong person as a character
and an excellent actress. She also has a very personal involvement
in what is going on in the world. Those three elements are
essential for someone to play that kind of role.
   Q. And Tom Berenger?
   A. I like Tom's cowboy style _ handsome and clean, he has that
kind of face. And then it's like the moon: He has a dark side. All
of us have our dark side. The important thing is how far we go with
our dark side.
   Q. As an outsider, do you think you have a better view of
America?
   A. Maybe not better. Different, surely, because I have so much
curiosity about your society. Everything that happens here has a
direct effect on where we are coming from, the smaller countries of
Europe, socially and artistically.
   We have a curiosity and also a tenderness about your country,
because you have given us some many things: movies, theater,
literature, music. These things we grew up on.
   Q. Your films always seem to have political overtones. Is this
because of your particular psyche?
   A. I prefer to say ``ethical,'' a more hopeful view. But if we
say ``political,'' I think all movies contain political meaning. .
.. Every movie reflects the philosophy or the ethics of its
authors. Mine are no exception.
   Q. Do you deplore that outpouring of mindless violence and silly
comedies that pour forth from the studios, especially in the
summertime?
   A. Oh yes, yes. ... Let's take an example: the last ``Rambo.''
Everybody says, ``Let's be peaceful, let's try to understand each
other, East-West.'' Then you have something that exploits passion
and hate and all those things.
   But on the contrary, there is in the summertime some
extraordinary qualities (in films). I like very much the light
movies. I like to go and have fun; it's very pleasant.

   The infant gingerly reaches for Ed Belling's
mustache. Their eyes meet and a big baby grin spreads across the
2-month-old's face.
   The boy's teen-age parents, homeless and drug addicted, aren't
there to capture the moment. But Belling is.
   He is one of a growing number of 60-minute dads and moms. They
give their time and love to help cuddle and care for the city's
small army of boarder babies _ infants forced to live in sterile
hospital settings.
   Looking around the crowded nursery at St. Luke's Hospital in
Manhattan, Belling, an unmarried box-office clerk, prefers to dwell
on the positive: ``What I've done is given a tiny baby some
nourishment, some comfort, even if it is only for an hour.''
   The babies wind up in hospitals for various reasons. Some have
been abandoned or have parents who can't afford to take care of
them. Most have parents who ``aren't fit to take care of them,''
usually addicts, says Anne Ormsby of the city's Human Resources
Administration, which oversees the boarder baby program.
   There are about 300 such infants in the city, most of them black
or Hispanic; children who, at one point, spent as much as three
months lying in steel-sided cribs and plastic bassinets, waiting to
be put in foster homes.
   Reforms in the system have since helped reduce that wait to an
average of five days for healthy infants. But those with special
needs can stay as long as eight months, says Carolyn Yordan, of the
Greater New York Hospital Association, which represents 70
hospitals.
   Boarder babies are fed and changed at regular intervals by
already overburdened staff nurses.
   But what about love?
   That's where people like Belling come in. They're part of St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Medical Center's volunteer program to give the
infants the human touch they crave.
   Nine women and eight men donate an hour each week to care for
the hospital's boarder babies.
   ``Before the volunteers came up to hold the babies in the
nursery, the babies were not reactive to anything,'' said Virginia
Crosby, director of volunteers at the medical center. ``They would
just lie there.
   ``The staff would go in and feed them when they could. The
babies didn't even react to sound after a while.
   ``Once the volunteers started, it was totally different,'' Ms.
Crosby said. ``They began to react to the love and you could see a
real difference.''
   It was there in the face of the month-old boy Loretta Donato
gently rocked in a dilapidated rocking chair inside St. Luke's
boarder baby nursery, a small, gray-walled room that would be
cheerless if not for the efforts of the staff nurses who used their
own money to decorate it.
   Eight tiny ``cribs'' _ actually, miniature hospital beds, their
iron sides disguised with white paint and brightened with colorful
mobiles _ dominate the room. The desolate hospital walls are masked
with a wallpaper border of skating bunnies.
   The ``Alice in Wonderland'' curtains remind Ms. Donato of the
story of Alice's tumble down the rabbit hole, and she tells it to
the baby content in her lap.
   Across the room, Ian McCart, who like Belling is single,
expertly changes a 2-week-old girl's diaper.
   McCart, a Manhattan banker who lives in Westchester County, went
to the hospital 18 months ago to volunteer to help AIDS patients
and met Ms. Crosby.
   One day, she coaxed him into going upstairs to look at the
babies. ``I was hooked,'' he said.
   Now, every Thursday after work, he takes care of AIDS patients
for an hour and then goes up to the nursery.
   ``I just love to sit quietly with the child and play
(tape-recorded) classical music,'' McCart said. ``It's the first
peace I have all day long.''
   For Mel Heiko, a 65-year-old lawyer with two grown daughters and
a 9-month-old grandson, the volunteer program is a second chance to
experience fatherhood.
   When his own children were young, he said, ``I was too busy
trying to carve out a career.''
   ``Sometimes you sit there and wonder what's going to happen to
them,'' said the 41-year-old Ms. Donato, a married advertising
executive who would like to have children but says ``nature has not
been so kind.''
   ``I often sit there and create whole futures for them,'' she
said. ``I like to think positive things. Maybe in some small way it
will rub off.''
   The volunteers never know where the babies go once they leave.
   ``I don't think I want to know, to tell the truth,'' said
Belling. ``A couple of times I've seen (the babies') parents up
there _ it's scary.
   ``I just think it's better for us and better for the babies if
we just spend that time with them, make that little bit of
difference.''

<HEAD>Last Survivor of Last U.S. Indian Massacre Looks Back</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last survivor of what many historians
regard as the last massacre of Indians in U.S. history thinks
returning to the site after more than seven decades may finally
bring the scope of the tragedy home to her.
   ``It would be strange because I feel like I stand off from all
of it,'' said Mary Jo Estepp, who was an 18-month-old child when
taken from her dead mother's back after the ambush in Nevada in
1911. ``It's in the distance, you know.''
   Though she is now making plans for the visit with friends, she
lived most of her 78 or so years with only an outline of her past.
Many details were finally supplied a few years ago by the author of
a book about her grandfather, an Indian named Shoshone Mike who
refused to live on a reservation.
   The ambush, by a white posse, left Mike and seven other Indians
dead in the snow near Winnemucca, Nev., on Feb. 26, 1911, 21 years
after the last major Indian massacre, at Wounded Knee, S.D.
   According to researchers, Shoshone Mike refused to settle on the
Fort Hall Indian Reservation in Idaho and instead roamed the
mountains near Twin Falls with his sons, daughters and
grandchildren.
   The Indians lived off the land and worked for farmers, living in
peace.
   But in 1910 one of Mike's sons was killed by a white horse
thief, and the family retaliated by killing the killer. Not
trusting white justice, Shoshone Mike took his family and fled into
Nevada.
   The 12 Indians survived a brutal winter by stealing cattle for
food. When four ranchers discovered the loss, the Indians killed
them and took their horses.
   Posses from Nevada and California pursued the Indians for 300
miles until Feb. 26, when they caught the ragged band sleeping and
slaughtered four men, two women and two boys during a brief battle.
One posse member was killed.
   The four surviving children were put in the Reno, Nev., jail
because there was no place else to put them.
   In his 1973 book about Shoshone Mike, titled ``The Last Free
Man,'' author Dayton Hyde noted the four surviving children, but he
was unable to find out what happened to them.
   A friend of Ms. Estep contacted Hyde after reading his book, and
Hyde traveled to her home in Yakima.
   There is still much Ms. Estep doesn't know about the time before
she was lifted from that blood-soaked cradleboard after falling
face-down in the snow. The identity of her father is unclear, as is
her age and whether she was born a Shoshone or a Bannock Indian.
   Still, she said, ``They know my mother was one of Shoshone
Mike's daughters. Her name was Snake.''
   The massacre in Nevada appears to have been the last of its kind
in the United States, said Frank Bergon, a professor of Native
American cultures at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., whose
novel, ``Shoshone Mike,'' was recently published by Viking. Hyde
agrees.
   Many massacres of whites and Indians occurred in the 19th
century. ``What makes this significant is it occurred in 1911, when
there were automobiles, airplanes and movies,'' Bergon said. ``The
fact that it did occur in the 20th century makes the whole thing
surreal.''
   After the massacre, the federal government ordered Evan Estep,
then the superintendent of the Fort Hall Indian Reservation, to
pick up the children.
   Ms. Estep's memories begin with the train trip north in November
1911.
   ``I remember when we went to the dining car I wouldn't eat the
food,'' she said. The exception was raisins in the raisin bread,
which tided her over. They may have reminded her of food her family
ate, but she isn't sure.
   The other three children died of illnesses within a year. The
toddler survived tuberculosis and was adopted by Estep and his
wife, Rita, who were childless. They guessed she was about 18
months old when she was found.
   She moved with the family to reservations in Montana and New
Mexico, finally settling at Toppenish on the Yakima Indian
Reservation in 1924.
   Although her adoptive parents told her about the massacre, she
never asked for details and they never talked much about Shoshone
Mike, she said. She was treated as a white person and noted, ``Most
of my friends are non-Indians.''
   The family moved to Yakima in 1930, after Estep retired. Ms.
Estep still lives in the house purchased by her adoptive parents,
who died in the 1950s.
   She graduated from Central Washington University with a music
degree and spent 40 years teaching school before retiring in 1974.
She never married.
   Her only tangible link with her Indian past is a single
black-and-white photograph of the four surviving children taken in
front of the Reno jail.
   It shows the children she had thought were siblings until Hyde
identified them: an aunt, Hattie, age about 4; an uncle, Cleveland,
about 7; and another aunt, Heney, who appears to be about 18.
   And, of course, the haunting photo shows herself, wearing a
white hat and crying.

   If you're a 6-foot-tall 13-year-old who can't
dribble a basketball, one of your options is to crack wise.
   For Brad Garrett, now 6-foot-9 and the star of CBS' ``First
Impressions,'' making jokes to make up for two left feet became a
successful career as a standup comedian.
   Now he's joined a growing legion of comics _ Garry Shandling,
Paul Reiser, Roseanne Barr, Bob Saget and Dave Coulier, for
instance _ who have made the transition from standup comedy to
situation comedy.
   ``It's funny,'' Garrett said. ``The transition a comedian has to
make, it seems, from the standup to the acting is trusting the
silence, not getting that immediate reaction and being comfortable
with that, because we're trained to be on the defense and always
have something to say.''
   What Garrett has to say often comes out in other people's
voices. ``First Impressions'' revolves around its star's ability to
mimic everybody from Bill Cosby to Hulk Hogan. Garrett plays a
voiceover actor in a small Omaha ad agency. He's also a single
parent trying to raise a teen-age daughter (Brandy Gold).
   ``First Impressions'' was to have been a summer replacement
series, but the writers strike pushed it into a more important role
as a quasi-fall series. It premiered Aug. 27 and runs until Oct. 22.
   The show is Garrett's second attempt at a sitcom. He made a
pilot a couple of years ago called ``Super Tomato.''
   ``It was about a grocery store,'' he said. ``Yeah. Wonderful.
And I was a clerk. ... I could send you a tape of that, really whip
your weekend into a frenzy, I think.''
   Before that, Garrett honed his standup skills, eventually
landing on the Las Vegas casino circuit. He chatted at a restaurant
in Manhattan on a break as the opening act with the Julio Iglesias
tour.
   Iglesias, he said, watched his act, but didn't always get it
since the Spanish singer doesn't speak much English.
   ``Unless you do an impression of Tito Puente, he's totally
lost,'' Garrett noted.
   The tour included 11 nights at Radio City Music Hall, not bad
for a 28-year-old comic. ``It's a dream to be able to walk out
there without a flashlight,'' Garrett said.
   Garrett is pretty darn noticeable even in Manhattan, just by
virtue of his height, but he was sporting a large, scraggly scar
down the middle of his nose that would draw a second look even in
this tough town. He had fallen off Iglesias' tour bus on a stop in
New Jersey.
   Clumsiness is what propelled Garrett into comedy, he said. He
moved around a lot as a kid. Imagine the reaction of basketball
coaches when he would arrive on the scene.
   ``I wasn't a jock. I mean, I can't walk and talk. ... I never
had the moves. Jews don't dribble anyway. It's the heritage.
   ``Everytime I'd go to a new school they (the coaches) would say,
this is it, this is the guy we've been waiting for, and when I'd
get on the court it was embarrassing. So I got into theater.''
   Getting into television was a little harder, a matter of getting
through the door _ literally. The producers of ``First
Impressions'' were so impressed by their 6-foot-9 find, they
constructed a special set to tone down the impact of his height on
screen.
   ``They had to make the set like 3 inches taller, enlarge the
doors and the countertops and the chairs,'' Garrett said. ``The
`elephant man' set I call it.''
   ``First Impressions'' airs Saturdays at 8 p.m. EDT.

   Elsewhere in television:
   `BURNING QUESTIONS' ON ABC _ Hugh Downs will anchor the
prime-time special ``Burning Questions: The Poisoning of America''
this Thursday, part of a week of ABC News programming on
environmental issues. Network News President Roone Arledge cited
this summer's drought in the Midwest, the national heat wave and
medical waste washing up on beaches as reasons for the special
focus. ``Burning Questions'' will ask just how much damage has been
done to the environment, and is it reversible. Other reports will
include a segment on water pollution on Friday's ``20-20'' and a
``Nightline'' sometime this week on the erosion of the ozone layer.
...
   THE (FIRING) LINE FORMS ON THE RIGHT. AND THE LEFT _ ``Resolved:
The Right is better able to deal with the Soviets than the Left.''
That is the question that will be debated by two all-star teams on
public television's ``Firing Line'' Wednesday. In this corner: the
show's host, William F. Buckley Jr.; former United Nations
Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick; U.S. Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., and
former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Arguing for the Left:
1972 Democratic presidential nominee George McGovern; 1984 and 1988
presidential candidate Gary Hart; U.S. Rep. Patricia Shroeder,
D-Colo., and former arms negotiator Paul Warnke.

<HEAD>Interest Rates Worry The Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The big ``whew'' from the stock market last
Friday came from evidence that inflationary pressures, and
therefore interest rate increases, might possibly be easing.
   As has happened a hundred times in the past, Wall Street once
again is mesmerized by inflation and interest-rate possibilities,
and it reacts almost instantly to any news on the subject.
   A high or rising level of interest rates is of special
importance to the stock market for at least two reasons:
   _First, it is generally agreed that the stock market collapse of
last October was triggered, at least in part, by rates rising to
levels that made debt securities more rewarding than stocks.
   _Next, high or rising interest rates become an important factor
in the cost of doing business, as well as a disincentive to market
expansion at all levels from consumers to manufacturers.
   Another reason might be added: The Federal Reserve Board has
been watching job figures for a clue to inflation. Strong job
figures might convince it to raise rates; a weaker job market would
mean an easing of pressure.
   After viewing the figures, Wall Street concluded that the
inflation threat might not be as bad as feared, and that the Fed
would have less reason to push up interest rates.
   But the the threat is not over, and Wall Steet will continue to
focus on borrowing costs and inflation. Wright Investors' Service
presents the case:
   At current interest-rate levels, says Wright, which advises on
billions of dollars of investment funds, the possibility of new
lows in stock prices _ lower than those of last October _ cannot be
dismissed.
   It points out that short-term interest rates are now more than 1
percentage point higher than they were one year ago at the stock
market peak, while long-term Treasury yields are around one-half
percentage point higher.
   In fact, high-quality corporate bonds offer a return nearly 2
percentage points higher than that available on stocks, a situation
that is out of whack with recent history.
   Over the past 20 years, stock earnings yields have averaged the
same as long-term bond yields. Prior to 1984, says Wright, bond
yields as high as today's would have precluded a stock
price-earnings ratio of more than 10.
   Thus, says Wright, ``the current stock market price-earnings
multiple of 12, while only average for the postwar period, may yet
prove to be excessive in today's environment.''
   Is the obsession with interest rates overdone? Does it ignore
positive factors? Perhaps.
   Investor confidence could be supported by other aspects of the
economy that show it to be stronger than a year ago, despite its
advanced age. Corporate earnings are setting records.
Price-earnings ratios have shrunk. Corporate takeover activities
continue to remove stock from the market, thus creating a relative
shortage of equities. And investor psychology is much healthier.
   A year ago, you may recall, investors floated on a cloud of
euphoria and cared little for such fundamental considerations as
real value. Now they fear the market; they study fundamentals, and
they don't take chances.
   Wright agrees that these are indeed encouraging signs.
Nevertheless, Wright and a host of other analysts wonder if those
interest rates still might not knock prices down as they did last
year.
   So long as the threat exists, says Wright, the bull market will
have to wait. When will it come? You can be confident, it
concludes, that a new bull market will get under way next year.
   Which means, in effect, that those interest-rate worries will
have abated.

<HEAD>Asians Keep Close Watch on Immigration Issue in Australia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Asians are keeping a close eye on an immigration
debate in Australia to see if it will mean a slow down in the flow
of Asian emigrants into the country.
   Some Asians say they see signs of racism.
   Several Asian newspapers have published editorials reminding
Australia of its growing economic links with Asian countries.
   ``The outcome of the intense immigration debate now under way in
Australia will either confirm or confound the view Asians hold that
a strong undercurrent of racism exists in the `Lucky Country',''
the conservative English-language South China Morning Post of Hong
Kong said.
   ``While Australia was founded on British values, the facts today
are that politically and economically the country cannot always
look West.''
   In Australia, a growing influx of Asian migrants is in the
background of a debate over immigration rules and multi-culturalism
_ a policy that encourages migrants to keep cultural links with
their homelands.
   John Howard, leader of Australia's opposition Liberal Party,
says immigration from Asia should be slowed in the interests of
social harmony and that immigrants should embrace the
English-speaking majority's Anglo-Saxon cultural values.
   ``I am not saying I would end Asian immigration,'' he said.
``But what I am saying is that it is a legitimate concern of any
community and any government to say that it is imposing social
tensions and that it is imposing a lack of social cohesion.''
   The government has proposed legislation that would prohibit the
use of race or ethnic origins as criteria for judging potential
immigrants' acceptability. Howard, who heads a two-party national
opposition, is against the bill but has lost support recently in
Parliament.
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke, of the Labor Party, has vowed to fight
any move to restrict Asian immigration and says he would maintain a
policy of non-discrimination even if he thought it would mean
losing an election.
   Australia, a continent with only 16 million people near Asia's
huge population of 3 billion, is an attractive destination for
emigrants. It is called ``lucky'' because of its rich resources and
comfortable climate.
   The Australian Bureau of Statistics says the number of Asian
immigrants climbed by one-third in the past year. Out of 116,430
immigrants between January and November 1987, 47,450 were Asians,
compared with 36,360 in the same period in 1986. Australia has
taken in 100,000 Vietnamese since 1975, when the Indochina war
ended, and has a growing Chinese community.
   Emigration counselors in several Asian countries list Australia
as attractive for its climate, proximity and educational
opportunities for children. Increasing numbers of Asians with
capital and business experience are snowing interest in emigrating
to Australia.
   In Taiwan, Australia now surpassed Canada and the United States
as the top choice of emigrants.
   ``People here barely knew anything about Australia three years
ago,'' said David Chang, manager of Taiwan's Queter International
Company, which handles emigration applications to Australia. ``But
emigrating to Australia has become a fad now.''
   Chang said he understood why Australia had doubled the capital
requirement for business emigrants to 500,000 Australian dollars
($410,000) in the past year.
   ``Australia no longer needs foreign capital and personnel now as
much as before. It is only natural that it closes the door a bit.''
   In Hong Kong, where emigration is on the upswing due to
nervousness over China's taking sovereignty of the British colony
in 1997, Australia is the second most popular destination after
Canada.
   Janet Sekavs, regional migration director in Australia's
Consulate in Hong Kong, said 6,431 Filipinos emigrated to Australia
in 1986, compared with 5,140 from Hong Kong and 5,032 from Malaysia.
   Chan Ka-wai, editor of The Emigrant, Hong Kong's magazine on
emigration, said he thought the number of emigration applications
would remain high even if Australia imposes new curbs.
   ``Australia is strange,'' Chan said. ``It is in Asia but it does
not treat itself as an Asian country. It is a multi-racial country
and economically it should have the potential to accept more
people.''
   Susie Tse, migration service manager of Price Waterhouse
emigration consultancy in Hong Kong, said, ``It would be racist if
Australia refuses Asians. But from my nine years' experience in
Australia, I have not felt any racism and am not sure if it is just
over-exaggeration by the press.''
   The fiercest reaction has come from a Malaysian newspaper, the
Star in Kuala Lumpur, where editor V.K. Chin wrote in a recent
column that Australians he described as racists make Asian
immigrants ``feel inadequate, insecure and even sub-human.''
   ``Based on the statements of some of these pillars of the
Australian political establishment, it would appear that inside
every Liberal senator or member of Parliament is a racist
struggling to get out,'' Chin wrote.
   ``Australia may be a big, wide-open country but it is in danger
of being led by small-minded people with petty prejudices and
attitudes more suited to the Victorian age.''

   Only a few birds are chirping at 8:30
a.m. when the sounds of Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 5 fill the
woods of this northern Michigan town.
   The World Youth Symphony is rehearsing for an upcoming
performance. The music flows with deceiving precision: One could be
listening to a symphony orchestra, not a collection of high school
musicians at summer camp.
   But this is anything but an ordinary summer camp.
   ``This place is a paradox because the natural aspect is serene,
but serene is hardly the word to describe the activity here. It's
crazy,'' said Ray Wilkins, chairman of the camp's visual arts
department.
   The National Music Camp, the 61st edition of which ended in
August, attracts 2,100 campers from third grade through high
school. They come from all 50 states and 26 foreign countries to
spend a summer of intensive study in music, dance, drama and the
visual arts.
   Many campers already are accomplished in their chosen field.
They come to hone their skills at the camp, which is spread over
1,200 acres and has about 450 buildings. The camper-staff ratio is
almost two to one, and private lessons are available for those who
want them.
   ``These are bright kids, and many of them are extremely
well-equipped for a career in the arts,'' said Tom Oosting,
director of the camp's theater program.
   With such a collection of talent, competition among campers can
get intense.
   ``People come to the National Music Camp to see how they stack
up,'' said Edward Downing, the camp's director. ``A lot of big
decisions can be made during the summer as young people decide on a
possible career in the arts.''
   Perhaps the most intense competition occurs every Friday, when
violinists in The World Youth Symphony challenge each other for the
right to sit in the first chair. The competition is known as
``Bloody Friday.''
   ``There are people who take it too seriously, but competition
has always been a part of being here,'' Downing said. ``We like to
think it's friendly competition and we try to keep it that way.
   ``It's an opportunity for the camper to show how he or she has
progressed, not necessarily to beat the next person ahead of you.''
   Despite the emphasis on the arts, campers enjoy their free time
like others their age. Many boys and girls like to find a secluded
spot in the evening to talk quietly.
   George Wolff, a high school student from Warren, Mich., said
some campers like to play classical music but never would listen to
it on their own. ``It's kind of humorous,'' he said. ``People will
play Mozart and Beethoven, then come back to their cabin and listen
to a Led Zeppelin cassette.''
   The camp's scenic location is a main reason youngsters get so
much out of the program.
   ``This place is absolutely conducive to clearing your mind and
focusing on your work,'' Oosting said. ``You need blue skies and
varied visual stimuli.''
   The camp, which was founded in 1927, also does its best to make
sure the kids are kept busy. Campers in the theater department can
be involved in up to three plays at one time.
   However, said Oosting, the theater program can be daunting.
Rehearsal time is limited because the camp's activities are
structured in 50-minute periods.
   ``Most Gilbert and Sullivan operettas are 2{ hours long, but are
rehearsed and staged here in 50-minute periods,'' he said. ``In
most cases, until the actual performance, it's probably never been
run through from beginning to end.''
   Campers belie their youth in terms of dedication to their
specialty. At night, it is not unusual to hear the sounds of a
violin or horn coming from cabins, as campers practice on their own.
   During the day, the youth bustle from one class to the next _
walking quickly with a clear sense of purpose.
   Wolff said he would like to become an opera singer, a career
goal shared by few of his peers.
   ``When I was 14 and listening to opera, it was hard for some
people to handle,'' he said. ``But I don't limit myself to
listening to just opera, I listen to all kinds of music.''
   The rules at the camp can be interpreted as strict. All campers
are required to wear a uniform _ blue corduroy pants for boys and
knickers for girls and blue shirts for all. Campers from third
through ninth grade are not allowed to leave the grounds during the
eight-week session. High schoolers are permitted to leave only with
their parents or other pre-approved adults.
   ``Yeah, sometimes the rules get out of hand, but it's really
trivial compared with what you're learning,'' Wolff said.

   The Boeing 727 skipped through a dry, rock-hard field off the
end of a runway, lost its right wing, turned 90 degrees and caught
fire.
   ``There was a humongous fireball. I didn't think anybody had
made it,'' said Mary Centron, a toll booth worker who also
witnessed the fiery crash of a Delta Air Lines jumbo jet three
years ago here.
   Yet one by one, passengers crawled and clawed their way to
daylight, some through doors, other through cracks in the aluminum
shell of this Delta jet, Flight 1141 of Wednesday.
   Some helped mothers get their babies out. The pilot, pinned in
the cockpit under a pile of debris, kept telling passengers, ``Slow
down. Watch your step.''
   Somehow, 95 survived. One woman ran to a road and flagged down a
ride back to the terminal. Another man said he's been hurt worse
shaving. Just 24 hours after the crash, 62 people had been treated
at hospitals and released.
   Thirteen people died. But experts and officials who specialize
in dealing with disaster called the relatively low death toll a
miracle.
   ``I had expected fewer survivors,'' said Julia Wells, a Parkland
Hospital emergency-disaster team nurse who arrived by helicopter.
``When you see a plane that looks like that, you don't expect that
many to be walking around.''
   While the National Transportation Safety Board evaluates the
cause of Flight 1141's disaster, investigators say they also are
studying why so many survived.
   ``It's a particularly important opportunity for accident
investigators,'' said U.S. Transportation Secretary James Burnley.
   Rescue workers credit their experience of the Delta crash three
years ago with preparing them for a fast, efficient effort. The
NTSB had criticized the response to the crash of Delta flight 191,
saying no coordinated effort was in place to handle the victims.
   ``There's no comparison. Everything went so smoothly,'' said
Texas Department of Public Safety Cpl. Bill Taylor.
   ``When we got here,'' paramedic supervisor Mike Sympson said,
``it was click, click, click.''
   And speed of evacuation, whether through the work of rescue
workers or the calm and capabilities of those on the plane, may
have been the key.
   ``It appears we got a majority of the passengers out before the
fire really set in,'' said Oris Dunham, executive director of the
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. ``Most of the fire
occurred after the plane was evacuated.''
   Those on board said somehow, calm prevailed. Passengers waited
in line to crawl through a hole in the fuselage, and helped each
other out. Smoke filled the cabin, some crawled on the floor. Many
could see the ominous orange flames of burning jet fuel.
   ``It was kind of surprising,'' said Andy Dyer, a passenger who
was on his way to help fight forest fires in Montana. ``There
wasn't any screaming hardly at all. It was real quiet. I think
everybody was aware of what was going on.''
   All but two who died were found in the rear of the aircraft,
many by an exit door that would not open. In fact, it took workers
one hour Thursday to jar the door loose.
   The plane hit the ground at the tail, investigators said. Fuel
from the ruptured right wing is thought to have sprayed the rear
and touched off the fire. The right engine was found 100 feet away.
The cockpit section of the 727 broke open, fire burned through the
plane's skin and melted the plastic windows.
   Yet the plane had come to rest without hitting any structures,
like two water tanks several hundred yards ahead. It was a similar
water tank that caused Delta 191 to break up and explode,
investigators said. That crash killed 137 people.
   For those back in the Delta terminal, it seemed horrifyingly
obvious what had happened. A cloud of black smoke, and eventually
live television pictures of the charred carcass of an airplane had
most, including relatives of passengers, assuming the worst.
   ``My husband was on the plane,'' JoAnn Waugh of Dallas cried to
a chaplain at the terminal.
   Later, she sprinted for an exit, racing to a nearby hospital
where her husband, Penn, was being treated for minor injuries.
   ``I'm the luckiest person in the world,'' she shouted as she
ran. ``God is so good.''

   Oil futures prices have responded negatively to
a report of more overproduction by OPEC.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for October
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil,
fell 10 cents per barrel to close at $15.08 Thursday. Other
contract months also dropped.
   Contracts for refined petroleum products finished mixed.
Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery rose 0.36 cent to
finish at 44.71 a gallon. The September gasoline contract fell 1.49
cents Wednesday, the last trading day before the contract expired.
Contracts for other months mostly were lower.
   Wholesale heating oil for October rose 0.14 cent to 43.46 cents
a gallon while other contract months were mixed.
   Analysts said the strength in gasoline and heating oil prevented
further declines in crude oil. They attributed the recent gains in
refined products to poor refinery economics. Outdated equipment,
for example, has lowered refinery capacity, keeping supply and
demand nearly equal, they said.
   ``Refining capacity has been pared down to the point where
refiners are having problems just keeping up with day to day
demand,'' said Jayne Ball, a commodity oil broker with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   Analysts said crude oil recovered from midday lows in response
to reports that the United Arab Emirates would exceed its
production quota set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
   In recent days, oil futures prices weakened after reports that
OPEC's 13 member nations were exceeding their collective quotas by
more than 3 million barrels.
   ``All this overproduction in a market where demand factors
haven't been substantial tends to be a price weakening factor and
the market goes down,'' Ms. Ball said. ``UAE claims it's going to
have production up to 1.9 million barrels per day, more than double
its quota, which is about 990,000 barrels.''
   Ongoing uncertainty about developments between Iran and Iraq
also softened crude prices Thursday, traders said.

   International Business Machines Corp. has fired
its longtime ad agency, which created the memorable ad campaigns
showing a Charlie Chaplin-like character making his chaotic
business run smoothly with IBM products.
   The computer giant ended a three-month review of its advertising
agencies by selecting Lintas:USA, a unit of the Interpublic Group
of Companies, and Wells, Rich Greene Inc. for its U.S. advertising
assignment.
   The decision was the latest blow to its long-time agency, Lord
Geller Federico Einstein Inc., which is losing its biggest client
and has been wracked by internal turmoil for much of the year.
   IBM reportedly spends more than $100 million a year on
advertising. accounting for about half of Lord Geller's estimated
$200 million in billings.
   Lord Geller, which had competed to keep the account and expected
to retain at least some of it, has worked for IBM since 1979,
creating the Chaplinesque ads and, more recently, a series of IBM
ads reuniting the former stars of the television show ``M-A-S-H.''
   Lintas is best known for its Cover Girl, Diet Coke and Chevrolet
ads, while Wells Rich Greene makes ads for Ford Motor Co. and
Benson & Hedges cigarettes.
   ``We received shocking news this afternoon,'' Lord Geller
executives told the agency's employees in a memo. ``IBM has decided
to move its account to two large agencies.''
   William Wardell, Lord Geller president, said he hopes the agency
can win another computer account over the next few months while it
continues to work through during a transitional period for IBM.
   ``There has been no talk whatsoever about closing,'' he said.
   Lord Geller, a unit of WPP Group PLC, has been in turmoil since
six of its top executives, including chairman Richard Lord and
president Arthur Einstein, walked off the job on March 18 to form
their own agency, blaming interference from WPP's management.
   London-based WPP Group acquired Lord Geller along with the much
larger J. Walter Thompson ad agency in mid-1987 when it bought JWT
Group.
   The defectors eventually were joined by a number of Lord Geller
employees, including about 25 people who formerly worked on the IBM
account.
   The breakaway led to a contentious and unresolved court fight
between WPP Group and the new agency and its leaders.
   In early June, IBM said it would review its agency requirements
and advertising direction and invited a limited number of agencies
to compete for the assignment, including both Lord Geller and the
breakaway agency, Lord Einstein O'Neill & Partners.
   IBM spokeswoman Theo Chisholm said the company heard
presentations from six agencies. In addition to Lord Geller, Lord
Einstein and the two winners, they were D'Arcy Masius Benton &
Bowles and Grey Advertising.
   In announcing its decision, IBM declined to say how much it
spends on advertising or how that spending will be split between
the agencies.
   It said Lintas will be responsible for IBM desktop products,
including the Personal System-2 line of personal computers, while
Wells Rich Greene will do corporate advertising as well as
``marketing image advertising and solutions advertising programs.''
   At Lord Einstein, Chairman Richard Lord said he was disappointed
but added, ``We never expected any IBM business when we left
there.''

<HEAD>Weather, Fashion Problems Blamed For August Slump</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's largest general retailers still are waiting for
business to improve after continuing problems in apparel lines and
unusually hot weather depressed sales again during August.
   ``It is not encouraging as a harbinger of what back-to-school
and fall is going to look like,'' Joseph Ronning, a retail industry
analyst with the investment firm Brown Brothers Harriman Inc., said
after reviewing sales results announced Thursday by storeowners.
   ``Some of the companies did worse in August than they did in
June and July,'' said Fred Wintzer, an analyst with Alex. Brown &
Sons Inc. in Baltimore.
   Several analysts blamed the August slump on the abnormally hot
weather parts of the country suffered through last month.
   Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co., said the
underlying sluggish trend in consumer spending _ which began in
February 1987 _ also remained in place.
   Retail sales have been a soft spot in an otherwise strong
economy. Consumer spending, which also includes outlays for food,
medical care, autos, utilities, transportation and other
necessities, is closely watched because it accounts for two-thirds
of the gross national product.
   Some analysts dismissed the weather as a factor. Monroe
Greenstein, of Bear Stearns & Co., noted sales were disappointing
on the West Coast despite more normal temperatures there.
   Greenstein said women are still disenchanted with retailers'
fashion lines. It was a year ago, in August 1987, that apparel
retailers fell into a slide as women refused to buy shorter skirts
and clothes they perceived as boring.
   ``A lot of retailers are pushing back their expectations for a
good pickup in business until October,'' Greenstein said.
   Jeffrey Edelman, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
said it was too early to get a good reading on how well the new
apparel lines are faring, but he said ``it appears as if some of
the new fashion is better than it was last year.''
   Edelman said some stores have reported a pickup in business this
week. Those sales will be reflected in retailers' September sales
figures.
   Several companies recorded sales increases under 3 percent,
meaning the stores were losing ground to inflation, which has run
at an annual rate of 4.5 percent so far this year.
   The nation's largest retailer, Sears, Roebuck and Co., said its
overall sales rose 6.3 percent from August 1987 levels, and its
sales for the first 30 weeks of the fiscal year increased 5.5
percent from the same period a year earlier. Sales from Sears
stores open at least a year _ known in the trade as same-store
sales _ were up 1.3 percent last month and 2 percent for the year
to date.
   Retailers and industry analysts believe same-store sales are a
more accurate yardstick of a company's performance than figures
which include sales from new stores. However, not all retailers
report both their overall and same-store results.
   K mart said its sales rose 6.4 percent in August, and 5.4
percent for the year so far. The retailer's same-store sales rose
2.2 percent for the month and 1.9 percent year-to-date.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said its sales rose 24 percent overall last
month, and have risen 30 percent so far this year. Its same-store
sales were up 8 percent in August, and have risen 12 percent during
the first seven months.
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. suffered a 2.6 percent drop in overall
sales last month, while sales for the year so far were up 1.8
percent. Same-store sales were down 3.4 percent last month while
rising 0.7 percent for the year so far.
   Dayton Hudson Corp. said its overall sales rose 15 percent last
month and 17.3 percent year-to-date. Same-store sales rose 1.7
percent in August and 1.5 percent for the first 30 weeks.
   May Department Stores Co. had a 19.6 percent jump in overall
sales in August while year-to-date sales improved 13 percent. May's
same-store sales were up 1.5 percent last month, and 1.3 percent
for the year so far.
   F.W. Woolworth Co. reported a 12 percent increase in August
sales, and an 11.9 percent rise for the first 30 weeks.
   Montgomery Ward & Co. said its August sales were up 4.7 percent,
while year-to-date sales rose 3 percent.
   The results were from general merchandise and apparel retailers.
Unlike monthly retail sales figures released by the federal
government, they do not include sales at auto dealers, supermarkets
or restaurants.

<HEAD>Detroit JOA `Blueprint' for Gannett Expansion, Arkansas Newspaper
Alleges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A partial merger between the Detroit News and
Detroit Free Press would mean trouble for the 25 other U.S. cities
that still have competing newspapers, according to an Arkansas
newspaper.
   The Arkansas Democrat of Little Rock filed a legal brief
Thursday supporting efforts to block a proposed joint operating
agreement between the News, owned by Gannett Co. Inc., and the Free
Press, owned by Knight-Ridder Inc.
   The Democrat's main competitor is the Arkansas Gazette, which is
owned by Gannett, the nation's largest newspaper chain. Gannett
bought the Gazette in 1986, the same year it acquired the News.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III approved the Detroit JOA on
Aug. 8, shortly before leaving office. Court challenges followed,
and the partial merger was delayed at least until next week, when
it is to be reviewed by a federal judge in Washington.
   ``A decision approving the JOA in this case would be a decision
providing a blueprint for the elimination of competition in the
remaining 25 cities with two newspapers,'' the Democrat's attorneys
said.
   Meese's decision, in designating the Free Press a failing
newspaper, ignored evidence that the newspaper's losses resulted
from strategic decisions rather than market economics, the brief
said.
   The Democrat asked the court ``to rule that a newspaper is not
failing when its losses are the result of predation.''
   The Democrat's brief said Gannett operated both the News and the
Arkansas Gazette at substantial losses in order to force smaller
competitors to incur more painful losses.
   ``Gannett's strategy in acquiring the newspapers in Detroit and
Little Rock was not to operate either profitably in a competitive
market, but was instead to eliminate competition either by
destroying its rival or by forcing its rival into a joint operating
arrangement,'' the brief said.
   Six days after Meese approved the Detroit agreement, the Gazette
lowered subscription prices to 85 cents per week from $1.98 per
week, the brief said.
   Gannett spokeswoman Sheila Owens said the company would not
comment immediately on the Democrat's allegations.
   Bill Malone, publisher of the Arkansas Gazette, said the Detroit
agreement ``has nothing to do with us at all here at the Gazette.''
   ``Number one, this price reduction was on the drawing board long
before we knew anything about the outcome of the JOA situation in
Detroit,'' he said. ``Number two, we're not trying to put them out
of business.
   ``If you will look at the things we have done, it's just to
match them _ free classifieds, we matched them with free
classifieds. As far as circulation pricing, all we've been doing is
matching what they've already been doing.''
   The Detroit agreement would merge News and Free Press production
and business operations while keeping separate the newspapers' news
and editorial departments. Profits and losses would be shared
equally by the newspapers after the first five years of the
100-year agreement.
   The newspapers sought exemption from federal antitrust laws
under the Newspaper Preservation Act, which allows such partial
mergers when one of the newspapers is declared in danger of failing.

<HEAD>Japan's Current Account Surplus In July Declines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan posted a current account surplus of $6.48
billion in July, down 11 percent from $7.28 billion a year earlier
but up slightly from $6.43 billion in June, the Finance Ministry
said Friday.
   The current account is the broadest measure of trade and
includes goods, services and investment income plus various
monetary transfers and aid payments.
   The surplus in the trade of goods alone widened from the
year-earlier level for the first time in 13 months, going up to
$8.76 billion from $8.58 billion. It also was up from a $7.38
billion surplus registered in June.
   The ministry said it is too early to conclude that Japan's
downtrend in the trade surplus has come to a halt. The July rise in
the merchandise trade surplus had been reported in early August
using a slightly different measure that made it the first such
increase in 15 months.
   The trade surplus, the main target of criticism from the United
States, European countries and other major trade partners of Japan,
had been declining consistently due to the yen's sharp appreciation
since 1985. A higher yen would restrain exports by making Japanese
goods less competitive abroad.
   Exports in July rose 16.8 percent over a year earlier to $22.8
billion, while imports surged 28.2 percent to a record $14.0
billion.
   Ministry officials said exports of ships, office automation
equipment, semiconductors, television sets and cameras were strong.
Exports also included parts and components that Japanese companies
shipped to their subsidiaries in other Asian countries for
assembly, they said.
   No breakdown of the trade surplus by countries or regions was
given.

<HEAD>Hearing Ordered On Witness Tampering Allegations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ordered a hearing to
consider allegations that potential witnesses were intimidated by
defense investigators in the fraud trial of Barry Minkow, founder
of the now-defunct ZZZZ Best Co.
   U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian ordered the hearing
Thursday after prosecutors claimed two potential witnesses said
they felt threatened by investigators working for defense attorney
David Kenner.
   ``We're going to talk to all the witnesses to see if there was
any tampering with witnesses or any intimidation,'' Tevrizian said.
``If that's the indication, I'll order the U.S. Attorney's Office
to file charges.''
   Minkow, who founded the carpet-cleaning firm in his parents'
garage when he was 15, has been charged in a 57-count indictment
accusing him of defrauding investors and banks out of more than $24
million. The trial began last month.
   ``This is an obvious attempt to intimidate the defense in
interviewing and preparing our case,'' said Kenner, who contends
that Minkow, now 22, was forced into the elaborate fraud by
mobsters.
   Investigator Paul Palladino, whose San Francisco firm worked for
the defense in the John DeLorean cocaine trial, denied threatening
or intimidating anyone.
   ``I haven't been doing this for 15 years to make that kind of
mistake,'' the investigator said.

   The stock market rallied sharply today,
responding to new statistics on employment that suggested a slowing
of economic growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 28.10 to 2,030.41
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 5 to 1 in the overall count
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 857 up, 174 down and
365 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 26.49 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Before the opening, the Labor Department reported that the
unemployment rate rose to 5.6 percent in August from 5.4 percent
the month before.
   In accompanying data that are watched especially closely on Wall
Street, the department reported smaller-than-expected increases in
payroll employment.
   The news was widely seen as reducing pressure on the Federal
Reserve to tighten credit.
   It got a rousing welcome in the bond market. Prices of long-term
government bonds, which move in the opposite direction from
interest rates, climbed as much as $15 for each $1,000 in face
value.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Express climbed 1[ to
29; International Business Machines 1| to 111~; Exxon | to 46{;
General Electric | to 40{, and Ford Motor { to 49].
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
jumped 1.59 to 148.27. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up 1.16 at 294.34.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 29.34
points to 2,002.31.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 359 up, 1,075 down and 487 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 144.09 million shares, against 130.48
million in the previous session.

   Two Northrop Corp. shareholders have filed
lawsuits against 38 current and former Northrop officials and
directors accusing them of illegal activities in connection with
the aerospace company's major defense programs, including the
failed F-20 Tigershark jet fighter.
   The suits, filed Thursday on behalf of Northrop, charge the
defendants with breach of fiduciary duties and violations of
various California statutes.
   The lawsuits, which also name Northrop as a defendant, seek the
return of all salaries and other compensation paid the directors,
officers and outside consultants as well as unspecified damages to
be paid to Northrop.
   The company has denied any impropriety.
   The suits, filed in state Superior Court by stockholders
Gabrielle Mayran and Rodney Shields, accuse the defendants of
wrongdoing in connection with most of Northrop's major defense
programs.
   Highlighted in the lawsuits was the failed attempt to sell South
Korea the F-20 Tigershark fighter plane, which the company couldn't
sell after spending $1.2 billion to build it.
   Mayran and Shields claim Northrop officials paid bribes in 1983
and 1984 to South Korean government officials to entice them to buy
the Tigershark.
   ``Many millions of Northrop's corporate funds have been wasted
in illegal bribes and expenditures in an unsuccessful effort to
sell the F-20 Tigershark fighter plane while over $1 billion of its
corporate funds were wasted prior thereto in an inept attempt to
develop and sell the F-20 Tigershark,'' the suit said.
   A congressional committee and a federal grand jury in Los
Angeles already are looking into payments the company made to
Korean companies and individuals in connection with attempts to
sell the ill-fated fighter.
   The suits also accuse the defendants of wrongdoing in connection
with the MX missile and the B-2 stealth bomber, saying problems in
both systems were ``due to the incompetence and mismanagement'' of
Northrop executives.
   The defendants include Thomas V. Jones, Northrop's chairman and
chief executive officer; Ken Kressa, president and chief operating
officer; 12 other company directors; 21 current and former Northrop
executives and employees; and three outside consultants.

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines won a major federal court
victory when a judge ruled lawsuits from the 1987 crash of a
Continental jetliner at Denver will be tried under Colorado law.
   The decision, reached Thursday, would allow a maximum award of
$45,000 in physical damages to relatives of crash victims who have
no dependants.
   The decision could save the carrier millions of dollars because
Colorado law is considered the most restrictive in the nation in
assessing damages. Lawyers for crash victims had sought trial under
a more liberal Texas law.
   U.S. District Court Judge Sherman G. Finesilver has not yet
decided what law will govern the award of punitive damages _ those
damages awarded if the airline or others are found negligent. A
hearing on that issue is set for Oct. 18.
   The National Transportation Safety Board is scheduled to release
its ruling on the cause of the crash at a hearing in Washington
D.C. on Sept. 27.
   Continental Flight 1713 crashed on takeoff Nov. 15, 1987,
killing 28 passengers and crew. Dozens of suits have been filed
against the airline and its parent, Texas Air Corp.
   Finesilver also on Thursday set a Dec. 5 trial date for crash
lawsuits. He ruled that only one of the suits will be tried then as
a way to save time and money. The outcome of that suit, which will
be selected as the most representative of the lot, will determine
how much liability will be placed on the airline and other parties
in the case.

<TEXT>
   As any casual follower of the stock market
knows, a lot of the market's recent woes have been blamed on rising
interest rates.
   But it is the way rates have been rising, even more than the
simple fact that they have been moving up, that particularly
troubles some analysts.
   With several nudges from the Federal Reserve, short-term
interest rates (on debt securities with lives of a year or less)
have climbed more sharply of late than long-term rates (on bonds
with maturities of up to 30 years).
   That means that what Wall Streeters call the yield curve, a
graphic representation of the relationship between short- and
long-term rates, is flattening.
   If it inverts _ that is, if short-term rates go higher than
long-term rates _ many analysts believe it would be a sign of
significant trouble for both the stock market and the economy.
   Normally, interest rates on long-term debt tend to be higher
than on short-term loans because long-term borrowers expose
themselves to greater risk that the purchasing power of their money
will be eroded by inflation, or that the issuer of the debt will
default.
   So when the yield curve tilts in the opposite direction, it is
widely taken as a sign that something is out of whack.
   Inverted yield curves showed up early in the bear markets and
recessions that occurred in 1973-74 and again at the beginning of
the 1980s.
   ``If the yield curve inverts, there is a very high probability
that a recession will follow,'' said Susan Berge Kent, an analyst
at Tucker, Anthony & R.L. Day Inc., in a recent commentary.
   Recently, she noted, the ratio of rates on three-month Treasury
bills to those on 30-year Treasury bonds stood at .78.
   ``If the ratio rises above .80 and the Fed does not cut the
discount rate, historical probability indicates that the yield
curve will invert,'' she said.
   Another cause for concern, in the view of Anthony Sorrentino,
technical analyst at Standard & Poor's Corp., is the fact that
rates on three-month T-bills, at more than 7 percent, are higher
than the Fed's discount rate, which it recently raised from 6
percent to 6.5 percent.
   ``Such a positive spread is a sign of a restrictive Federal
Reserve policy, which usually places downward pressure on the stock
market,'' Sorrentino said.
   ``Until the T-bill rate falls below the discount rate, this
measure will remain in a bearish mode.''
   Analysts at the financial advisory service Donoghue's
Moneyletter say managers of money market mutual funds have also
been sounding a warning about interest rates and the financial
outlook in recent months.
   As a group, these managers have been shortening the average
maturities of the securities in their portfolios.
   The standard motive for shortening maturities is to avoid or
minimize price declines for existing securities when interest rates
rise, and to have money available soon to invest at higher rates.
   ``When these managers believe interest rates are poised for a
rise, they invest their funds in shorter-term securities,'' the
newsletter said.
   ``Since the shortening began, the stock market generally has
been moving sideways, and it recently has declined in the face of
higher interest rates.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices for grain and soybeans opened
slightly lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade on profit-taking
ahead of the long Labor Day weekend.
   ``We had some pretty good gains here during the week and now
people are cashing in,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   He said additional early selling pressure stemmed from an
increase in farmers' sales of corn and soybeans overnight and from
the Agriculture Department's rejection this morning of China's
second bid for 300,000 metric tons of subsidized U.S. wheat.
   Some analysts said traders were disappointed by the USDA's
announcement late Thursday that the Soviet Union had purchased only
100,000 metric tons of U.S. corn. Rumors earlier in the day had put
the Soviet corn purchase at 1 million metric tons.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent to 2\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.97{ a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 2 cents lower with September at $2.89 a bushel; oats
were } cent to 1{ cents lower with September at $2.59{ a bushel;
soybeans were 2{ cents to 4 cents lower with September at $8.65 a
bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly higher while pork futures were mixed
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .15 cent higher with October at
71.25 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .13 cent
higher with September at 81.05 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent
lower to .15 cent higher with October at 38.90 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .02 cent lower to .33 cent higher with
February at 49.20 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures closed mixed on Thursday.

<HEAD>IRS Extends Arthur Andersen Probe To Electric Cooperatives Around
Country</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Agriculture Department and Internal
Revenue Service are studying the books of 11 electric cooperatives
and utilities with ties to the Chicago accounting firm of Arthur
Andersen & Co.
   The inquiry is focusing on possible tax violations and illegal
accounting practices by Oglethorpe Power Corp., an Atlanta-based
electric cooperative.
   Richard Allen, USDA's Southeast regional inspector general, said
the government also is examining the role of Arthur Andersen, the
nation's largest accounting firm and the auditor for all 11
cooperatives.
   Allen said that records from the companies were subpoenaed in
June, but that the cooperatives were not necessarily targets of the
federal probe at that time.
   All of the cooperatives are recipients of loans from the Rural
Electrification Administration, which is part of the Agriculture
Department, he said.
   Oglethorpe, which is owned by and provides electricity to 39 of
Georgia's 42 electric membership corporations, has been the target
of both a civil and criminal investigation by the IRS over its tax
returns from 1980 through 1983. It also reported this year it was
under investigation by the Agriculture Department.
   The IRS, in a related probe, is investigating Atlanta-based
Southern Co., the utility holding company, and its subsidiaries,
including the Georgia Power Co., in connection with allegations
that Southern defrauded the government of millions of dollars by
improperly accounting for spare parts.
   During the past week, investigators from the inspector general's
office spent three days examining records at the Raleigh offices of
the North Carolina Electric Membership Corp., said spokesman Owen
Bishop.
   Carl Whillock, president of the Arkansas Electric Cooperative
Corp. in Little Rock, Ark., said his company provided a ``limited
number'' of accounting documents in response to a June subpoena but
had heard nothing from investigators since then.
   ``They told us the subpoena they've issued to us does not mean
we are the target of an investigation,'' Whillock said.
   Sunflower Electric Membership Corp. in Hays, Kan., also received
a subpoena for records relating to its dealings with Arthur
Andersen, The Atlanta Constitution quoted an unidentified spokesman
as saying.
   An unidentified spokeswoman for the Rural Electrification
Administration identified the cooperatives in the inquiry, besides
Oglethorpe, as the Sacramento Municipal Utility District of
Sacramento, Calif.; United Power Association of Elk River, Minn.;
Dairyland Power Cooperative of LaCrosse, Wis.; Corn Belt Power
Cooperative of Humboldt, Iowa; Sunflower Electric Cooperative of
Hays, Kan.; North Carolina Electric Membership Corp. of Raleigh;
Arkansas Electric Cooperative of Little Rock; Square Butte Electric
Cooperative of Grand Forks, N.D.; Eastern Iowa Light and Power
Cooperative of Wilton, Iowa; Thumb Electric Cooperative of Ubly,
Mich., and Owen County Rural Electric Cooperative Corp. of Owenton,
Ky.
   David Kaplan, general counsel for the Sacramento Municipal
Utility District, said the utility had not been subpoenaed.

<HEAD>Subroto Calls For Revamped OPEC Production Policy</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subroto as one word is correct</NOTE>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto arrived in Kuwait
Friday after visits to Baghdad and Tehran, where he apparently
failed to settle the problem of setting oil output levels for Iraq
and Iran.
   In arrival statements, Subroto indicated that he saw a solution
only through a revamped production policy for the entire 13-member
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   Subroto's talks in Iran and Iraq this week reportedly focused on
the question of whether Iraq should be allowed to increase its oil
production quota to parity with Iran.
   The Kuwait News Agency quoted him as saying it was ``necessary
that OPEC member states look into this problem (Iraq and Iran
output) within the framework of the basic issue from which OPEC
suffers ... overproduction by OPEC member states beyond the 15.06
million barrels daily ceiling.''
   Iraq has refused to adhere to its quota of 1.54 million barrels
a day, demanding parity with Iran's 2.369 million. Iraq's
unrestrained current output is estimated at 2.8 million barrels a
day.
   KUNA said Subroto indicated the Iraq-Iran production controversy
``cannot be solved separately from the rest of the pending issues
related to OPEC production.''
   Among the issues Subroto is discussing during his current tour
of Persian Gulf nations is the production level of the United Arab
Emirates, which he visited on an earlier tour and which currently
is estimated to be producing at least twice its allotted quota. The
U.A.E. announced its quota should be 1.5 million barrels a day
instead of its alloted 948,000.
   Since late 1986, the cartel has slashed its aggregate output by
more than 3 million barrels per day to try to stabilize nosediving
prices around an $18-a-barrel benchmark.
   But quota violations by member states has made the target price
elusive. OPEC's current output is about 20 million barrels although
the official overall ceiling set by the cartel is 15.06 million,
excluding Iraq.
   In Kuwait last week on his way to Tehran and Baghdad, Subroto
said he believed it was reasonable that Iraq and Iran should have
equal quotas of 2.3 million barrels a day.
   His statements to KUNA here confirmed he had made no headway so
far. But he was quoted as saying ``we have not yet despaired and we
still have a number of proposals in this connection.''
   Subroto said he discussed with Iraqi and Iranian officials ``the
future level of output for each of Iraq and Iran,'' KUNA reported.
He could not predict when a settlement was possible and said a
single visit to each capital ``is difficult for reaching a
solution.''
   In Baghdad earlier in the day, Subroto declined to comment to
reporters on the result of his talks there. Iraqi officials
described the talks as ``satisfactory.''
   The official Iraqi News Agency said only that Iraq's oil
minister, Issam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalabi, and Subroto discussed
recent developments in the oil market.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge today dismissed two
lawsuits seeking $3 billion from space shuttle rocket-maker Morton
Thiokol Inc. by a former company engineer who warned against the
ill-fated 1986 Challenger launch.
   U.S. District Judge David K. Winder granted Morton Thiokol's
request for dismissal of the suits filed by Roger Boisjoly, who
left the company in July 1986, citing physical ailments and alleged
mental torment.
   Telephone calls to Boisjoly's Willard home were not immediately
returned.
   In his decision, Winder dismissed most counts in Boisjoly's
suits with prejudice, meaning they cannot be refiled.
   But the judge said he would dismiss two counts of one suit,
which deal with allegations of defamation and conspiracy, without
prejudice.
   In one suit, Boisjoly sought $1 billion for the deaths of the
seven astronauts killed when Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986,
and $1 million in compensatory damages for Boisjoly's health and
career.
   Boisjoly claimed Morton Thiokol impugned his professional
reputation after he and other engineers testified before a
presidential commission investigating the disaster that they had
warned against the launch.
   His other lawsuit, filed under the False Claims Act on behalf of
U.S. taxpayers, sought $2.075 billion and alleged that Morton
Thiokol knowingly provided NASA with defective solid rocket motors.
   Winder ruled that ``the `conspiracy' alleged in the complaint is
not of a nature to support an action for damages on the part of
Boisjoly. ... Neither the conspiracy itself nor the overt acts
allegedly done in furtherance of it were directed toward Boisjoly.''
   The judge wrote that ``to suggest that the recommendation or the
launch were acts directed toward and for the purpose of injuring
Boisjoly is ridiculous.''
   ``Furthermore, for a reasonable person to know that Boisjoly
might suffer emotional injury as a result of the launch would
include the requirement that the person know that the launch would
end in disaster,'' Winder added.
   ``The dismissal of these two suits completely vindicates Morton
Thiokol,'' said Morton Thiokol spokesman Ed Snow. ``We are very
happy to have this situation behind us.''
   Company attorneys had argued that Boisjoly's contention that he
was defamed was based on office chatter. ``It is just
workplace-related talk that goes on all the time,'' attorney Robert
Jordan told the judge at a hearing in February.
   However, Boisjoly's attorney, Robert Levin, accused company
officials of launching a campaign to defame the engineer through
pamphlets and interviews.
   ``This is not a disgruntled person,'' Levin argued. ``This is an
engineer who stood up and risked his career and hurt his health
because he had this alternate view.''
   In a May interview, Boisjoly said it was only after two years of
therapy and ``the positive catharsis'' of lecturing on the disaster
that he was able to stop blaming himself for the destruction of the
shuttle and deaths of its astronauts.
   ``For a long time, I bore the burden of guilt because I hadn't
done more to stop it,'' he said. ``But I've resolved it now. I did
everything I could.''
   Boisjoly and several other Morton Thiokol engineers argued the
night before the launch that temperatures of 53 degrees or less
could cause a rocket joint seal to fail.
   But after a second caucus with NASA officials, Boisjoly said,
company managers ``perceived pressure from NASA. ... There was no
other justification for the launch. I felt the pressure, others
felt the pressure.''
   The Rogers Commission, which investigated the disaster, blamed
the tragedy on a leaking joint seal that allowed superhot gases to
escape and ignite the shuttle's external fuel tank. Investigators
said the cold had weakened the seal.
   Boisjoly took disability leave in July 1986, and left the
company for good two months later.
   This year, he won the Scientific Freedom and Responsibility
Award from the American Association for Advancement of Science.

   The stock and bond markets rallied powerfully today after the
Labor Department said the U.S. unemployment rate rose to 5.6
percent in August, a figure that eased concerns the economy was
growing too briskly.
   The news that more Americans were out of work cheered up
investors who were worried that the Federal Reserve would have to
raise interest rates to stave off inflation.
   Bond prices staged their biggest rally of the year, driving
yields back down to the levels of early August. The yield on the
Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond plunged to 9.03 percent from 9.30
percent late Thursday.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped
53.34 points to 2,055.65 by 1:30 p.m. EDT.
   The Dow Jones average's rise triggered a New York Stock Exchange
prohibition on member firms' use of NYSE automated systems to
perform a form of program trading known as index arbitrage. The
prohibition kicks in when the index rises or falls more than 50
points.
   The dollar fell slightly against most major currencies as
investors decided that U.S. interest rates would drop and make
dollar-denominated securities less attractive to global investors.
   The Labor Department said the number of jobless Americans jumped
by 226,000 in August to 6,851,000, as four months of hiring booms
in factories and retail stores screeched to a halt.
   The August figure was 0.2 percentage point higher than July's
civilian jobless rate of 5.4 percent, which was up 0.1 percent from
June's 14-year low of 5.3 percent.
   A separate survey of business payrolls, which many economists
consider a more reliable indicator of the economy's health, showed
219,000 new jobs in August, well below the 400,000 average monthly
increase in June and July.
   Today's unemployment data followed another government report
showing the first quarterly decline in U.S. labor productivity
since 1986.
   Analysts said the report indicated that hard-pressed businesses
were being forced to hire less-skilled workers to fill job openings.
   The Labor Department said Thursday that the labor productivity
of non-farm businesses fell 1.4 percent in the April-June period,
less than the originally reported 1.7 percent decline.
   The report was roughly in line with expectations and did not
have a large effect on the financial markets.
   Stock prices fell Thursday in sympathy with previous declines in
Tokyo and London. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped
29.34 points to 2,002.31.
   Other reports Thursday took some of the edge off fears of
inflation and rising interest rates.
   August sales figures indicated the nation's largest general
retailers were unable to escape their 18-month-old slump as weather
and continuing problems in apparel lines kept customers away.
   Also, the Commerce Department said construction spending rose
1.2 percent in July after slumping in June.
   On productivity, the Labor Department released revised figures
showing productivity fell at an annual rate of 1.4 percent in the
April-June period. The statistic measures the output per hour of
labor for non-farm businesses.
   Labor costs shot up at a 5.7 percent annual rate _ the biggest
increase since 1986 _ reflecting the productivity declines and wage
and benefit increases averaging 4.2 percent annually.
   Charles Renfro of Alphametrics, an economic forecasting firm in
Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said the figures indicate that an ``inflationary
head of steam is building.''
   Economic output in the second quarter rose 3.3 percent, but to
achieve the increased output, businesses had to raise the number of
hours worked by their employees by 6.6 percent.
   Analysts said the increase in hours and consequent decrease in
productivity reflects a hiring boom in which employers at a time of
decade-low unemployment are relying more on less-skilled workers.

   The dollar fell against major currencies in
European trading Friday after the announcement of slightly
higher-than-expected U.S. August unemployment data.
   Gold prices also fell.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar dropped sharply against
the West German mark after the U.S. Labor Department's announcement
that the unemployment rate had risen to 5.6 percent from 5.4
percent in July.
   Most traders had expected the unemployment rate to have remained
at about the same levels as July, they said.
   One trader at a German bank in Frankfurt said the unemployment
data accelerated an already noticeable downward trend in the U.S.
currency because the data suggested the American economy is slowing
down, dampening expectations that the United States would increase
interest rates in the near future.
   However, trading generally was quiet Friday, with many market
participants confused about the market outlook and unwilling to
take positions before the upcoming three-day Labor Day weekend in
the United States.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.05 yen to a closing 136.75 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 137.65 yen.
   Other late dollar rates, compared with late Thursday: 1.8665
West German marks, down from 1.8795 1.5725 Swiss francs, down from
1.5835; 6.3365 French francs, down from 6.3780; 2.1050 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.1205; 1,388.50 Italian lire, down from
1,398.50; 1.2362 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2370.
   In London, the British pound fetched $1.6755, compared with
$1.6730 Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $429.40 a troy ounce and
at midmorning the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $428.95. Late Friday, gold fell to $427.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $428, down from $430.50 late
Thursday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.26 to close at $431.35.
   Silver was quoted in London on Friday at a bid price of $6.52 a
troy ounce, down from $6.58 Thursday.

   The nation's unemployment rate rose to 5.6
percent in August as four months of hiring booms on factory
assembly lines and in retail stores came to an abrupt halt, the
government said today.
   The Labor Department said the number of jobless Americans jumped
by 226,000 to 6,851,000 in August while the number of those with
jobs rose by only 121,000 to 115,180,000.
   The 0.2 percentage point increase from July's civilian jobless
rate of 5.4 percent followed a 0.1 percent rise from June's 14-year
low of 5.3 percent.
   The report sparked a rally on Wall Street. The Dow Jones average
of 30 industrial stocks climbed sharply in early trading as
investors apparently viewed the unemployment rise as reducing
upward pressure on interest rates and inflation.
   Most of the increased joblessness was suffered by adult men,
with their unemployment rate rising 0.4 percentage points to 4.9
percent. The jobless rate among adult women, meanwhile, fell from
5.1 percent to 4.8 percent, the
   A separate survey of business payrolls _ which many economists
consider a more reliable indicator of the economy's health _ showed
219,000 new jobs in August, well below the 400,000 average monthly
increase in June and July.

   Labor Department said.
   White House spokesman B. Jay Cooper, in California with the
vacationing president, called the report ``good news.''
   ``The continued strong gains in August payroll employment
confirm that the longest peacetime expansion in U.S. history
continued through its 69th month,'' the spokesman said.
   Despite the increase in unemployment, Cooper said the
administration was cheered by ``the good numbers underneath the
overall numbers,'' such as in the jobless rate for women.
   The last time the civilian unemployment rate was at 5.6 percent
was in May.
   The goods-producing side of the economy lost jobs for the first
time since last January, with employment in manufacturing dropping
by 5,000 after a 70,000 jump in July.
   The Labor Department said small employment gains in printing and
publishing and export-related industries such as machinery and
electrical equipment were more than offset by 9,000 job losses in
textile and apparel plants and smaller declines in several other
manufacturing industries.
   Employment in oil and gas drilling also declined slightly, but
it rose a minuscule 3,000 jobs in construction.
   On the services side of the economy, large monthly increases in
retail trade hiring _ 80,000 in July alone _ slowed to just 23,000
new jobs last month, virtually all in grocery stores.
   Other recent high-growth job areas also slowed. Business
services such as temporary help firms added just 16,000 new
workers, compared with average monthly increases of 60,000 through
the spring and early summer.
   New employment in health services, which the government predicts
will be the largest area of job growth in the 1990s as the Baby
Boom population ages, slowed to 22,000 in August. It also had been
rising an average 30,000 a month in the past year.
   ``The labor market showed less strength in August than earlier
in the year,'' said Labor Statistics Commissioner Janet L. Norwood.
``Looked at over a somewhat longer period, however, the rate has
hovered in the 5.3 percent to 5.6 percent range since last March
and is 0.4 percentage point below the leval a year ago.''
   Ms. Norwood said one encouraging sign was that the number of
people working part-time involuntarily because they could not find
full-time jobs ``returned to the bottom of the 5.2 million to 5.6
million range within which it has been fluctuating for more than a
year.''
   ``The proportion of working-age persons holding jobs remained at
its record level of 62.3 percent,'' Ms. Norwood told the Joint
Economic Committee of Congress.
   Other data in the report, however, suggested that the economy
might be slowing. The average workweek declined by 20 minutes to
34.6 hours and manufacturing overtime fell by 0.1 hours to 3.8
hours a week on average.
   That sent weekly earnings down nearly a full percentage point as
average hourly wages for non-supervisory workers held steady at
$9.24.
   In the past 12 months, the Labor Department said, wages have
risen an average of only 3.1 percent, decreasing the buying power
of workers, after taking inflation into account, by half a percent.
   A separate calculation that includes the 1.7 million uniformed
armed forces in the job market showed a jobless rate of 5.5 percent
last month, up from 5.4 percent in July.
   The government offered this other figures on unemployment in
August:
   Whites, 4.9 percent, up from 4.7 percent in July.
   Blacks, 11.3 percent, down from 11.4 percent.
   Hispanics, 8.4 percent, up from 8 percent.
   Teen-agers, 15.8 percent, up from 15.2 percent.
   Black teen-gers, 15.8 percent, up from 15.2 percent.
   Private analysts had anticipated the overall jobless rate might
rise prior to today's report.
   ``I think we're going to be stuck near 5.5 percent for the rest
of the year,'' said Roger Brinner of Data Resources Inc., a
Lexington, Mass., economic consulting firm. ``Employment is not
going to fall; it's just not going to rise as fast as it has been.''
   Brinner, like other economists, believes too many people, many
of them with only marginal skills, have been hired in recent months
in relation to the rate of economic growth.
   ``We may be at the point where we have absorbed most of labor's
skilled capacity,'' said Charles Renfro, chief economist for the
forecasting firm of Alphametrics, also of Bala Cynwyd. ``Anything
less than an uptick in the jobless rate will be a real danger sign
that the economy is overheating.''
   Bruce Steinberg, an economist for Merrill Lynch, noted that new
claims for unemployment compensation rose slightly last month, an
indication of increased layoffs in some areas.
   Steinberg believes there is still room for the jobless rate to
fall over the next several months, ``but not in August.''

   The stock market rallied sharply today, inspired
by new statistics on employment that suggested a slowing of
economic growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 29.34 points
on Thursday, climbed 51.32 to 2,054.23 by 2 p.m. today on Wall
Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 7 to 2 in the overall
count of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 1,146 up, 311
down and 424 unchanged.
   Before the opening, the Labor Department reported that the
unemployment rate rose to 5.6 percent in August from 5.4 percent
the month before.
   In accompanying data that are watched especially closely on Wall
Street, the department reported smaller-than-expected increases in
payroll employment.
   The news was widely seen as evidence that growth was slowing,
reducing prospects for heightened inflationary pressures and giving
the Federal Reserve more leeway in its credit policy.
   The figures got a rousing welcome in the bond market. Prices of
long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite direction
from interest rates, climbed as much as $15 for each $1,000 in face
value.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Express gained 1 to
28~; International Business Machines 4[ to 114]; Exxon ~ to 46};
General Electric 1[ to 41, and Ford Motor 1 to 49~.
   Redman Industries jumped 1~ to 10[. The company said it agreed
to be acquired by an investor group for $10 a share.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
3.02 to 149.70. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.99 at 295.17.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 125.18 million shares with two

   Share prices closed at their best levels Friday on
the London Stock Exchange, buoyed by a strong opening on Wall
Street.
   Dealers said London shares also were boosted by higher U.S.
unemployment figures for August announced in Washington, which
eased fears of inflationary pressures.
   At the end of trading, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was up 16.4 points, or 0.94 percent, at 1,746.9,
its best level for the day. The index hit its low point of 2.9
points higher shortly after the opening.
   Dealers said Wall Street's early 26.49-point surge in the Dow
Jones industrial average, to 2,028.81, was sparked by July's
revision to the non-farm payroll component within the latest U.S.
employment data. In addition, the rise in the jobless rate in
August to 5.6 percent from 5.4 percent in July calmed inflationary
worries.
   The Labor Department in Washington said U.S. non-farm payroll
jobs created in August totaled 219,000. The revised unemployment
rate for July remained unchanged at 5.4 percent, but the non-farm
payroll gain was revised downward to 200,000 jobs from 283,000 jobs.
   Market expectations had been for an unchanged jobless rate in
August and non-farm payrolls at around 224,000.

   A tentative deal was reached Friday for
French businessman Bernard Tapie to take a majority share in Donnay
SA, the Belgian sporting goods maker that went bankrupt last month,
officials said.
   Under the accord Tapie will get 51 percent of Donnay which until
its bankruptcy was majority-owned by the Donnay family.
   The government of Wallonia, Belgium's French-speaking southern
half, will get a 29 percent stake and Albert Frere, head of Group
Bruxelles Lambert, the holding that owns Belgium's second largest
bank, will control 20 percent.
   Donnay, the world's top maker of tennis rackets a decade ago,
was declared bankrupt Aug. 12 after it failed to agree with
creditors on new funds and a restructuring of its debt which totals
$35 million.
   Donnay reached its peak when Bjorn Borg advertised its products,
but began to suffer losses after the Swedish tennis ace retired in
1981.

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peru's economy minister resigned Friday, three
months after taking office, following a government report that
showed inflation soared a record 243 percent during the first eight
months of the year.
   President Alan Garcia immediately appointed a new economy
minister, Abel Salinas, to fill the post vacated by Cesar Robles,
the official gazette El Peruano said.
   Analysts said Robles' resignation was expected after
disagreements arose in the Cabinet of Ministers over how to
reactivate the nation's recession-ridden economy.
   Salinas, current energy minister and former interior minister,
was expected to move quickly to combat inflation with another round
of austerity measures, analysts said.
   Jorge Carrasco, a congressional deputy and president of the
Chamber of Deputies' Energy Commission, is to head the energy
ministry, the gazette said.
   Robles, the third economy minister in Garcia's center-left
government, assumed his post just three months ago as a recession
deepened and inflation skyrocketed.
   According to the government report, manufacturing has continued
to decline, shortages of basic consumer products are widespread and
the cost of living rose 30.9 percent in July, the highest single
month total in Peruvian history.
   The National Statistics Institute said in a gazette communique
Friday that August consumer prices increased 21.7 percent over the
July level, and 243 percent from January through August.
   Independent analysts project inflation will pass 500 percent
this year. The previous high mark was 158.3 percent in 1985.
Inflation last year was 114.5 percent.

the wheat market is primed for a sharp upturn based on expectations
of tightening world supplies.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 3 cents higher with September

<HEAD>Officer In Athletic Footwear Company Settles Insider Trading
Complaint</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An executive of Reebok International Ltd., an
athletic footwear company based in Canton, Mass., settled insider
trading charges Friday by agreeing to surrender profits and pay a
penalty.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission, in a complaint filed in
U.S. District Court in Boston, accused Robert Slattery, a division
vice president of Reebok, of profiting by misusing privileged,
non-public information in Reebok's acquisition of another footwear
firm, Avia Group International Inc., based in Portland, Ore.
   Without admitting or denying the charges, Slattery agreed to
disgorge $11,130 in profits and pay an equal sum in penalties.
   The SEC said Slattery on Feb. 11, 1987, purchased 1,000 shares
in Avia for $19 a share. Shortly after that, he learned that Reebok
planned to acquire Avia for about $16 a share.
   When Reebok announced the acquisition at $16.35 a share on March
10, Avia stock plunged from $27.50 to $16.50. A day earlier,
Slattery had sold his Avia stock for about $26 a share, avoiding a
loss of $9,209, the agency alleged.
   It also said that on the day before the announcement Slattery
purchased 20 options on Reebok stock, which was trading at $37.37
share, allowing him to buy it later in March and April at $40 a
share. Following the announcement, the Reebok price went to $41.62
and Slattery profited by $1,920, the SEC said.
   Reebok officials did not immediately return telephone calls for
comment.

<HEAD>Stock Index Futures, an American Invention, Debuts in Japan</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Saturday in lead graf is correct.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trading of stock-index futures began Saturday in
Japan, theoretically giving investors a new opportunity to protect
themselves if and when the big rally in the world's largest
securities market ends.
   Although stock-index futures have been blamed by some critics
for playing a significant role in the October stock market crash in
the United States, there seems to be little concern the same thing
could happen here, partly because of what strategists called
Japan's penchant for caution.
   ``The Japanese are a very wise people,'' said Alan Johnson, an
Asian-Pacific futures specialist at Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers
International Ltd. ``They like to acclimatize themselves properly
before doing anything. Going off the board isn't their way of life.
Their way of life is to do all their homework very carefully and
make sure it works.''
   A distinctly American financial invention that the Japanese have
been eying for years, stock index futures are obligations to buy or
sell the equivalent cash value of a group of stocks at a set price
on a set date.
   Purchased for only a small fraction of their total worth, index
futures theoretically enable investors to bet on the overall
direction of the stock market. Index futures can serve as hedging
mechanisms against a market drop or an inexpensive way to speculate
on a market advance.
   Their eagerly awaited premiere in Japan comes at a particularly
opportune time, because Japanese stock prices have been trading
near their record highs. There has been increasing concern over how
long the rally will last, and investors have been looking for ways
to protect themselves in a decline.
   The debut of index futures in Japan also coincides with
simmering controversy in the United States on the impact of such
financial strategies. U.S. critics say index futures encourage
reckless speculation and conflict with the kind of long-term
investing in individual stocks that is essential for healthy
markets.
   Moreover, the critics contend, the development of high-speed
computerized trading of index futures and the stocks that comprise
them in order to profit from price differences, a technique called
index arbitrage, has injected frightening volatility into the
markets and discouraged would-be investors.
   Some studies have blamed index arbitrage for aggravating the
Oct. 19 collapse of stock prices in the United States.
   In U.S. trading, the most popular index futures are based on the
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, and the Major Market Index, a
measurement of 20 stocks that closely tracks the more widely known
Dow Jones Industrial Average.
   The Japanese concocted their index futures based on the Nikkei
Index of 225 Selected Issues, which began trading Saturday on the
Osaka Securities Exchange, and the Tokyo Stock Price Index, called
Topix, which began trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   Japanese market professionals said trading began slowly,
reflecting an underlying cautious approach. They said it would
probably take a few years for the Japanese to develop profitable
index arbitrage computerized strategies, and in the meantime the
impact on stock prices likely would be small.
   Part of the problem in developing such strategies, they said, is
that some stocks represented in the Nikkei or Topix indexes cannot
be traded via computer, which makes complicated arbitrage
strategies difficult.
   In addition, Japanese stock markets are protected from wild
swings by the daily limits placed on individual shares, another
potential obstacle to profitable arbitrage between stocks and index
futures.
   Both the Nikkei and Topix contracts will have a limit of 3
percent for a single day of trade, although if the market is
orderly then exchange officials have the power to allow continued
trading.
   ``Of course when volume builds up over time, the futures will
become another factor affecting stocks,'' said a futures trader at
Salomon Brothers Inc.'s Tokyo office, who asked not to be
identified by name. ``But I don't think there will be all that much
speculative interest.''

<HEAD>Travel Agents Claim Delta Practices Unfair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coalition of 24 travel agencies in Utah
has taken legal action in an effort to combat what it claims are
unfair trade and pricing practices by Delta Air Lines.
   The group, called the Independent Travel Agency Alliance,
contends that Delta has entered into exclusive marketing
arrangements with Utah's three largest travel agencies, placing
members of the alliance at a competitive disadvantage.
   The Delta marketing agreements, according to the coalition,
allow the three big travel agencies _ Murdock Travel, Morris-Ask
Mr. Foster and Beehive-Bonneville Travel Group _ to offer special
``bulk fares'' or ``tour-based fares.''
   Bulk or tour-based fares, which airlines have designed for the
leisure travel market, do not require advance booking by travelers
and represent a significant reduction from airlines' standard fares.
   The special fares include round-trip air travel and, in some
instances, either a car rental or hotel accommodations.
   Alliance members claim they are not allowed to offer the special
fares to their customers and as a result have lost substantial
business.
   Attorney Richard W. Giauque of Salt Lake City said a complaint
was filed Thursday with the U.S. Department of Transportation on
behalf of the 24 Utah travel agencies.
   He said the complaint seeks an order barring Atlanta-based Delta
from offering the special travel arrangements or compelling the
airline to make them available to all travel agents.
   Al Kolakowski, Delta's assistant vice president of sales, said
the bulk fares are designed for the leisure travel market and not
the business travel market.
   ``We've been offering these fares across our system,'' he said.
``The fares are part of a tour package which can include mandatory
car rental or a minimum stay in a hotel.''
   But alliance members contend that Utah's big three travel
agencies are aggressively advertising and promoting the special
fares to corporate clients.

<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For Minnetonka Corp., there may be
only one ``Obsession.'' But now the company hopes to extend its
success in the personal fragrance business into ``Eternity.''
   Minnetonka is spending about $18 million to launch Eternity,
another Calvin Klein fragrance that the company says will appeal to
a growing set of Americans interested in true romance and lasting
love.
   Robert Taylor, founder and chairman of Bloomington-based
Minnetonka, said he expects the new, floral scent to be as popular
as its steamier predecessor, Obsession.
   ``Obsession stands for the '60s and '70s of the sexual
revolution. It's warm and sensual,'' Taylor said. ``I think
Eternity stands for love, romance and commitment.''
   Regardless of the values they espouse, both perfumes have the
smell of money.
   Obsession is the sales leader at Calvin Klein Cosmetics Corp.,
the subsidiary that accounted for an estimated $105 million of
Minnetonka's 1987 sales of $152.4 million, said Marsha Raley, a
stock analyst for Dain Bosworth Inc., Minneapolis.
   ``We think Eternity will be as big as Obsession,'' Taylor said.
   Largely on the continued strength of Obsession sales, Minnetonka
is expected to record net income in 1988 of about $15.5 million, or
95 cents a share, Raley said. That compares with net income of
$10.1 million, or 57 cents a share, in 1987, not counting the
after-tax gain of $65 million on the sale of Softsoap to
Colgate-Palmolive Co.
   ``They're very creative,'' Raley said. ``They're good at
identifying mass psychology trends.
   ``If you read the public right and you simplify what the public
wants and you color it the way you think they want it colored then
you end up striking a successful chord,'' Raley said.
   Taylor and Kim Delsing, executive vice president of Calvin Klein
Cosmetics, credit the fashion designer for attaching significance
to Eternity. Klein is settling down after undergoing treatment for
an addiction to vodka and valium and his life mirrors the message
of Eternity, Delsing said. In fact, the fragrance got its name from
an inscription on a ring purchased by Klein about a year ago for
his wife. He bought the ring from a Duke of Windsor collection.
   ``Everything about Eternity so epitomizes his new lifestyle,''
Delsing said.
   But Eternity wasn't designed in ``random creative'' fashion,
Taylor said. Instead, Minnetonka identified a niche in the perfume
market opposite Obsession and screened the samples that Klein chose
from.
   ``It's more of a directed creative approach,'' Taylor said. ``We
didn't want to cannibalize Obsession.''
   Minnetonka has hopes that both fragrances will prove to be
classics. Channel No. 5, for instance, has survived for 65 years.
   Taylor, whose company acquired Calvin Klein Cosmetics in 1981,
said he'll keep Obsession and Eternity alive by restricting
distribution to about 700 stores. At $185 an ounce _ $10 more than
Obsession _ Eternity is decidedly upscale and gets prime display
space, he said.
   ``We don't do anything unless it's prime,'' Taylor said.
   Eternity made its debut from June through August at two Saks
Fifth Avenue stores in New York. Its national launch officially
began this week, but Dayton Hudson department stores have been
selling it since the first weekend in August, said John Brennan, a
senior buyer of fine fragrances for Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson
   ``It's been tremendously successful,'' Brennan said. ``We had
customers literally grabbing four or five bottles off the first
cart as it was being unpacked.''
   Taylor said Eternity has been his company's chief focus for the
past year. Next year an Eternity for men will be developed and
Calvin Klein Cosmetics will introduce a line of dressing
accessories such as belts, purses and cosmetic bags.
   Meanwhile, Calvin Klein continues to hold about 12 percent of
Minnetonka Corp. stock, which has been selling in the range of $16
a share. Taylor said Klein has no intention of seeking a
controlling interest in the company.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irish Distillers Group PLC, the target of a
hostile takeover bid, indicated Friday that France's Pernod Ricard
SA could emerge as a ``white knight'' merger partner.
   Pernod said Thursday that it raised its stake in Irish
Distillers to 2.8 percent from nearly 1 percent, about a week after
it revealed it was holding talks with Irish whiskey maker.
   A spokeswoman for Irish Distillers said discussions between the
two companies continued in Dublin on Friday and involved ``all
possibilities,'' including a possible offer.
   ``There is no timetable for the conclusion of these talks but it
will be as soon as possible,'' she said.
   Irish Distillers has been under siege from British liquor group
Grand Metropolitan PLC, which launched a hostile $359 million bid
two weeks ago.
   Grand Metropolitan has said it will not raise its offer unless a
third party enters the bidding.

   The stock market staged a strong rally today,
inspired by new statistics on employment that suggested a slowing
of economic growth.
   Before the opening, the Labor Department reported that the
unemployment rate rose to 5.6 percent in August from 5.4 percent
the month before.
   In accompanying data that are watched especially closely on Wall
Street, the department reported smaller-than-expected increases in
payroll employment.
   The news was widely seen as evidence that growth was slowing,
reducing prospects for heightened inflationary pressures and giving
the Federal Reserve more leeway in its credit policy.
   The figures got a rousing welcome in the bond market. Prices of
long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite direction
from interest rates, climbed more than $20 for each $1,000 in face
value.

   The Environmental Protection Agency said
Friday it plans to levy a $1.4 million civil fine against Minnesota
Mining and Manufacturing Corp. for illegally importing and using
two unspecified chemicals.
   The agency said it had cut the proposed penalty in half because
the St. Paul, Minn.-based company voluntarily disclosed the
violations immediately after they occurred.
   The agency said it was not disclosing the chemicals in question
and the dates of the violations because 3M was entitled to keep
that information confidential.
   Federal law forbids manufacturing, importing and commercial use
of chemicals not on EPA's approved list unless the agency is given
90 days notice to review the new chemical.
   3M has 20 days to answer EPA's charges. In St. Paul, company
spokesman Mark Fenner said he was unable to comment because he had
not been made aware of the accusations.

   The soft drink makers are recruiting some tough
characters for commercials designed to convince men that it's okay
to drink diet colas.
   This summer it was boxer Mike Tyson in commercials for Diet
Pepsi. This fall, it will be a few dozen pro football players for
Diet Coke.
   It's a new approach for sugarless sodas, a majority of which
have traditionally been consumed by women.
   A decade ago, the soft drink makers say, women consumed about 75
percent of the diet soft drinks purchased. Atlanta-based Coca-Cola
USA said that percentage has since fallen to about 65 percent.
   Nonetheless, Michael Beindorff, vice president of advertising
for Coca-Cola, said a big block of men remains ``averse to diet
soft drinks.''
   He hopes to change that attitude with a campaign that begins
Monday, and will eventually feature players from every National
Football League team in local print and broadcast ads for diet Coke.
   The first commercial airs during the season's first Monday Night
Football telecast on ABC matching the Washington Redskins and the
New York Giants.
   In the ad, Redskins linemen Charles Mann and Dave Butz toss a
quarterback rather than a coin to decide who gets the last Diet
Coke during practice.
   Additional ads will appear locally during the season. In some
cases, players will appear in versions of an ad adapted for local
use.
   For instance, Beindorff said one local ad will show three
players from a team with a tiger, a bear or some other team symbol.
   As the camera pans over them, the announcer will say ``three out
of four (Bengals or Bears or whatever) prefer'' Diet Coke.
   Jesse Meyers, publisher of Beverage Digest, a trade publication
based in Greenwich, Conn., said soft drink sales rose about 4
percent last year to $40 billion, but that the diet segment has
been growing four to five times faster.
   His 1987 beverage rankings listed Diet Coke as the third best
selling soft drink behind Coca-Cola Classic and Pepsi with 7.7
percent of the market, and Diet Pepsi fourth with 4.8 percent.
   Meyers gives Pepsi ``high marks for clearly identifying the male
image'' with its ads that featured Tyson, who defended his
heavyweight title and said Diet Pepsi did too in taste tests
against Diet Coke.
   Beindorff said the new diet Coke ads were in development long
before the Tyson ads ran. While he would not disclose how much they
cost, he said the fees for all the football players will come to
only a fraction of the $1.25 million he said Pepsi reportedly paid
Tyson.

   The stock market rolled up its sharpest gain in
more than three months Friday, inspired by new statistics on
employment that suggested a slowing of economic growth.
   Falling interest rates in an enthusiastic bond market helped to
keep the rally going.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 52.28 to 2,054.59
for its biggest one-day advance since it rose 74.68 points on May
31. The average finished the week with a net gain of 37.16 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,197 up, 296 down and 439 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 159.84 million
shares, up from 144.09 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 183.57 million shares.
   Before the opening, the Labor Department reported that the
unemployment rate rose to 5.6 percent in August from 5.4 percent
the month before.
   In accompanying data that are watched especially closely on Wall
Street, the department reported smaller-than-expected increases in

   The figures got a rousing welcome in the bond market. Prices of

value.
   Analysts said it was also a healthy sign that stock trading
volume stepped up to its highest level in more than two weeks, even
with many traders presumably getting an early start on the long
Labor Day weekend.
   All 30 of the stocks that make up the Dow Jones industrial
average posted gains.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Express gained 1\ to
29[; International Business Machines 3} to 114; Exxon 1 to 46~;

be acquired by an investor group for $10 a share.
   Nantucket Industries, traded on the American Stock Exchange,
rose 2 to 8]. Integrated Resources made an $8.50-a-share offer for
the company.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $47.60 billion, or
1.84 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks

   A report that more Americans were out of work
triggered a powerful rally on Wall Street Friday as investors
figured a slowdown meant less inflation and lower interest rates.
   The government's report of a rise in the civilian jobless rate
to 5.6 percent in August helped calm a market that has been worried
for months that the economy was growing too quickly and might go
into an inflationary spiral.
   ``It's bad news, I guess, for job searchers, but it's not
necessarily bad news for consumers in general,'' said George
Iwanicki, an associate economist for Kidder, Peabody & Co.
   Stock prices leaped and the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial
stocks rose 52.28 points to 2,054.59, its biggest rise since a
74.68-point gain on May 31.
   The rise of more than 50 points triggered a restriction on
member firms' use of computers for a form of program trading. The
collar is designed to avoid chaotic swings in stock prices.
   Friday's rally began in the bond market, which staged its
biggest rally since Oct. 22, the aftermath of the stock market
crash, according to an index of all outstanding Treasury issues
maintained by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond staged its
second-biggest rally of the year. The price of the Treasury's
30-year bond briefly rose almost $30 for every $1,000 in face value.
   Late in the day, the long bond's price was up about $25.90,
driving its yield down to 9.04 from 9.30 percent late Thursday. The
only bigger rally of 1988 was a $26.25 price increase on Jan. 15,
after the government reported a big drop in the trade deficit.
   The bond market is highly sensitive to inflation and takes
weaker growth as good news. When bond prices rose, investors moved
to the stock market in search of bargains.
   For stock investors, the higher jobless rate was good news
because it seemed to lessen the likelihood that the economy was in
the late stages of an inflationary boom that would end up with a
bust, said David Bennett, a market analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   In the long run, a slight increase in joblessness could mean
more stable, prolonged growth, Bennett said.
   In spite of the uptick in the jobless rate, from 5.4 percent in
July and a 14-year low of 5.3 percent in May, the economy continues
to be expanding and the nation is not far from full employment,
Iwanicki said.
   ``Fundamentally, the economy is quite strong,'' said Helen
Hotchkiss, a senior economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Analysts said the slight increase in the jobless rate eases
pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to cool
down the economy. In particular, it reduces the probability that
the central bank will move before the election to raise its
discount rate, which it charges on loans to banks.
   The number of jobless Americans grew by 226,000 in August and a
four-month hiring boom in the nation's factories ended abruptly,
the government said.
   A separate survey of business payrolls showed employers adding
219,000 new jobs in August, compared with average monthly gains of
more than 325,000 the previous three months.
   Despite the increase in the unemployment rate, the Labor
Department said a record 62.3 percent of the working-age population
16 and over held jobs in August.
   Average hourly wages for non-supervisory workers held steady at
$9.24.

Eases</HEAD>

   Money traders dumped dollars in a hectic selloff
and sharply depressed the currency Friday after a surprising Labor
Department unemployment report that showed the U.S. economy may be
slowing down.
   Gold prices eased. Republic National Bank in New York quoted
bullion at $429 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $429.75
late Thursday.
   Currency brokers said the foreign-exchange market was stunned by
the Labor Department's report, which showed an unexpectedly big
rise in unemployment figures last month, from 5.4 percent of the
workforce to 5.6 percent.
   Contrary to earlier evidence about the economy, the Labor
Department report implied that growth is easing, thereby relieving
inflation pressure and lessening the prospect of higher interest
rates.
   Many currency traders have been assuming that as a consequence
of a growing economy, U.S. interest rates must rise, which would
make dollars more valuable.
   ``The unemployment number wasn't taken very well at all, to say
the least,'' said John W. Baker, chief currency dealer at the New
York office of Bank Julius Baer & Co., a Swiss banking concern.
``People got a little panicked about holding dollars.''
   Currency strategists said that if the next series of U.S.
economic reports provides more evidence of a slowdown, then the
dollar's appreciation over the last four months could erode
dramatically.
   In Tokyo, where trading ended before the release of the U.S.
unemployment figures, the dollar rose 0.05 yen to a closing 136.75
yen. Later in London, it was quoted at 137.65 yen. By the time
trading concluded in New York, the dollar had fallen to 135.97 yen,
down from 136.27 yen late Thursday.
   The British pound fetched $1.6755, slightly higher than its
$1.6730 exchange rate Thursday. In New York, the pound strengthened
further to $1.6850, up from $1.6693 late Thursday.
   Other late-dollar rates in New York compared with levels late
Thursday included: 1.8524 West German marks, down from 1.8730;
1.5567 Swiss frrancs, down from 1.5787; 1.2355 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.2363; 6.2915 French francs, down from 6.3670; 1,381.50
Italian lire, down from 1,393.75.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Thursday: 1.8665
marks, down from 1.8795 1.5725 Swiss francs, down from 1.5835;
6.3365 French francs, down from 6.3780; 2.1050 Dutch guilders, down
from 2.1205; 1,388.50 Italian lire, down from 1,398.50; 1.2362
Canadian dollars, down from 1.2370.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
fell 90 cents a troy ounce to $429.30. Earlier in London, gold
closed at $427.50, down from $430.70 Thursday; in Zurich it fell
$2.50 to $428; and in Hong Kong it fell $1.26 to $431.35.
   Silver was quoted at $6.52 a troy ounce in London, down from
$6.58 Thursday. On the New York Comex, silver for current delivery
fell 5.6 cents to $6.518.

   Ford Motor Co. will recall 18,000 1984 Tempo and
Topaz cars and spend up to $8.1 million on anti-smog repairs to
meet California emissions standards, the California Air Resources
Board said Friday.
   In a news release, the regulatory board said Ford will be
sending notices through October to owners of 1984 Tempo and Topaz
models sold in California with 2.3 liter engines, offering free
repairs.
   Dealerships will adjust air injection systems and install larger
catalytic converters, at a cost to the manufacturer of about $450 a
vehicle.
   The Air Resources Board said that in tests of vehicles driven by
California motorists, the cars exceeded allowable limits of
smog-forming hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen and emitted more
than twice the allowable amount of carbon dioxide.
   California and federal regulations require cars to meet
emissions standards for five years or 50,000 miles, and California
law requires manufacturers to repair emissions control system
defects free during that period.

<HEAD>Bond Market Posts Biggest Gain Of Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Buisiness Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Treasury bond market posted its biggest gain
of the year and interest rates tumbled Friday as a new report on
employment in August indicated the pace of economic growth may be
slowing.
   The report defused concerns, at least for the time being, that
the economy may be growing so fast that it could ignite inflation,
which eats away at the value of fixed-income investments such as
Treasury notes and bonds.
   Slower growth is a plus for bond prices because credit demands
and price pressures are usually lower in such periods and interest
rates can fall.
   The Shearson Lehman Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, climbed 12.24 points to 1,142.50.
   That was the biggest rise since a 15.00-point advance on Oct.
22, 1987 when the Federal Reserve was standing ready to provide
liquidity to the financial system in the wake of the stock market
crash. The biggest rise in the composite index this year had
previously been a 12.05-point increase on Jan. 15.
   The Treasury's 30-year bond climbed nearly 2| points, or about
$26 for every $1,000 in face amount. That was slightly below the
$26.25 rise on Jan. 15, when the market was cheered by a narrowing
of the nation's trade deficit.
   Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price,
skidded to 9.04 percent from 9.30 percent late Thursday. That was
its lowest since it finished at 9.03 percent on Aug. 4.
   The bond rally was sparked by the government's report that the
nation's unemployment rate rose to 5.6 percent in August from 5.4
percent in July.
   A companion report on business payrolls said there were 219,000
new jobs in August, and revised downward the payroll growth
previously reported for July. In addition, the report indicated a
decline in hours worked and only a slight increase in average
hourly earnings index for August.
   William V. Sullivan Jr., director of money market research for
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said the report ``allays the market's
fears that the economy was moving into an overheated phase.''
   He said the pace of trading was moderate, a pickup from the slow
pace that has preceded release of the report.
   Elliott Platt, director of fixed-income research at Donaldson
Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp., said, ``It was one of the most
broadly-based, good reports we have seen in a long time.''
   Sung Won Sohn, chief economist for Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis,
said the report means ``there is virtually no chance that the Fed
will tighten in the near future'' since the economy appears weaker
than some presumed it was.
   Platt said the report may mark a turning point for trends in
longterm rates, but Sohn said he expects rates will head higher
later this year.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues rose by between { point and } point, intermediate
maturities were up by between a full point and 1{ points and
20-year issues were up 2{ points, according to Telerate Inc., a
financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   In corporate trading, prices rose. Moody's Investment Grade
Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 3.34
to 287.76.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills, meanwhile, fell to 7.42
percent as the discount fell 8 basis points to 7.20 percent. Yields
on six-month bills fell to 7.78 percent as the discount fell 8
basis points to 7.40 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.04
percent as the discount fell 16 basis points to 7.50 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 8 3-16 percent, down from 8\ percent late
Thursday.

<HEAD>Bond Futures Soar On Jobless Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury bond futures prices soared Friday on the Chicago Board
of Trade as news of a rise in the nation's unemployment rate eased
inflation fears.
   On other markets, stock-index futures surged; precious metals
futures fell; energy futures dropped sharply; grains and soybeans
advanced; and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   The Labor Department's report that the jobless rate rose to 5.6
percent in August was good news to bond futures traders who had
been worried the economy was expanding too quickly.
   But even more welcome was the news that the average hourly
earnings index, a measure of wages, rose just 0.1 percent last
month after gaining 0.4 percent in July, said Sam Kahan, an
economist with Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc. in
Chicago.
   ``The market was saying to itself, `Hey, look, the unemployment
rate is going down, yet the economy is strong and the cost of labor
has not accelerated all that much,''' Kahan said. ``So they decided
... inflation was not accelerating as much as was feared
heretofore.''
   The contract for December delivery of the U. S. Treasury bond
rose 2 3-32 points to 87 19-32. On cash markets, the yield on the
benchmark 30-year bond dropped to 9.14 percent from 9.30 percent.
   Stock-index futures also soared in reaction to the jobless rate.
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the contract for September
delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500 index finished 6.80 points
higher at 265.60.
   Precious-metals futures initially plunged on the unemployment
news, with platinum down nearly $19 a troy ounce at midday.
   Precious metals, commonly seen as an investment hedge against
inflation, tend to rise and fall with inflationary expectations.
Friday's sharply lower crude oil prices added to the bearish tone
in the metals markets, analysts said.
   But precious metals prices recovered late in the session to
close only modestly lower.
   Peter Cardillo, commodities trading adviser with Josephthal &
Co. in New York, said the metals markets remained technically weak
despite the comeback.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum settled $7.90 to
$8.20 lower with October at $523.50 a troy ounce. On New York's
Commodity Exchange, gold settled 90 cents to $2.70 lower with
October at $431.80 a troy ounce; silver was 5.6 cents to 8 cents
lower with September at $6.518 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures prices settled sharply lower on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, capping a bearish week brought on by reports
of more OPEC overproduction.
   Crude oil for October delivery slid to a seven-week low,
breaking a key support level of $15.10 a barrel and dragging other
contract months down. Contracts for refined petroleum products also
finished down sharply.
   Analysts linked the week's decline to reports that some members
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries were
continuing to ignore production quotas, increasing the world's oil
supply and further weakening prices.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 29 cents to 33 cents
lower with October at $14.79 a barrel; heating oil was .40 cent to
.58 cent lower with October at 42.88 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .38 cent to .73 cent lower with October at 43.98 cents
a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures finished mostly higher on the Chicago
Board of Trade in a late surge fueled by technical factors in the
absence of new supply-and-demand developments.
   After the close, the Agriculture Department announced sales of
800,000 metric tons of U.S. corn to the Soviet Union. Rumors of a
large corn sale to the Soviets had boosted corn futures prices
earlier in the week.
   Wheat settled } cent to 4 cents higher with September at $4.01 a
bushel; corn was unchanged to 1{ cents higher with September at
$2.90{ a bushel; oats were } cent lower to { cent higher with
September at $2.59{ a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents lower to 7{
cents higher with September at $8.73 a bushel.
   Cattle futures posted strong gains in a late surge of
pre-weekend position squaring on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Pork futures retreated on fears of slackening demand.
   Live cattle settled .20 cent to .90 cent higher with October at
72 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .83 cent higher
with September at 81.35 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .45
cent lower with October at 38.52 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .42 cent to .82 cent lower with February at 48.65 cents a
pound.

<HEAD>Big Board Reallocates Four Stocks in Disciplinary Move</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Stock Exchange said Friday that it
has removed the rights of two specialist firms to make markets in
four stocks following inquiries into their conduct during the
October crash and its aftermath.
   The disciplinary move by the nation's biggest stock market
against the firms, Stern & Kennedy and Spear, Leeds & Kellogg,
brought to 11 the number of stocks that have been reallocated from
NYSE specialists because of probes into how well they handled the
panicky buying and selling during the crash.
   In the NYSE system for stock trading, 54 specialist firms
control the rights to market certain stocks and are required to
keep order by setting opening prices and covering trades using
their own money when there are too few buyers or sellers.
   Specialist monopoly rights on stocks are considered extremely
valuable because the firms get the great majority of business in
those stocks. Removal of those rights by the NYSE is considered a
significant punitive measure.
   The NYSE said after the crash that it would investigate several
cases in which the specialists failed to maintain orderly trading
in stocks they controlled. NYSE spokeswoman Sharon Gamsin said the
announcement Friday marked the conclusion of those investigations.
   As is NYSE policy, she declined to elaborate on what the
specialists did or failed to do. But she reiterated the Big Board's
position that ``we think the specialists did an excellent, though
obviously not perfect job.''
   Carl Hewitt, a staff attorney at Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, said
the firm would have no comment on the NYSE's action. A receptionist
who answered the telephone at Stern & Kennedy's office said nobody
was available to comment.
   A brief NYSE press statement said the exchange would reallocate
Stern & Kennedy's rights in Loctite Corp.'s stock following a
review of the specialist firm's actions on Black Monday, Oct. 19.
   The statement said Spear, Leeds & Kellog's specialist rights
were removed from Alleghany Corp. and Greyhound Corp. because of
the firm's performance on Oct. 20; and its specialist rights were
moved from Kysor Industrial Corp. because of the firm's Oct. 22
performance.
   ``After discussions with the NYSE, Stern & Kennedy and Spear,
Leeds & Kellogg agreed voluntarily to withdraw as the specialist in
each of the stocks,'' the statement said.
   An NYSE committee that assigns stocks to specialists was
accepting applications from other firms that want to make markets
in the four stocks and will likely announce its decision next week,
Ms. Gamsin said.
   For Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, one of the biggest NYSE specialist
firms, it was the second reallocation resulting from post-crash
inquiries. Previously, the firm surrendered its franchise in J.P.
Morgan & Co.'s stock.
   In addition, the specialist firms Wagner, Stott & Co., M.J.
Meehan & Co. Lawrence, O'Donnell & Co., and LaBranche & Co. have
relinquished market-making rights in some stocks since the crash.

<TEXT>
   The purchase of Lucky markets by American
Stores Co. should be stopped because it would cost California
consumers millions of dollars a year in higher food prices, the
state attorney general said Friday.
   Attorney General John Van de Kamp filed suit in U.S. District
Court here late Thursday, seeking to block the $2.5 billion
purchase of Lucky Stores Inc. by American Stores, which runs the
supermarket Alpha Beta.
   Van de Kamp said a merger of the two companies would violate
state antitrust laws.
   The deal, and the unrelated purchase of 172 Safeway stores in
southern California by the Vons Cos., had been approved by the
Federal Trade Commission, which analyzes the effect of business
combinations on competition and prices.
   But Van de Kamp, standing in an alley beside one of American's
Alpha Beta markets in the predominantly Hispanic Westlake district,
accused the FTC of failing to protect the interests of California
consumers.
   ``This injustice will strike most cruelly at those least able to
afford it _ the poor, the elderly, the least mobile of our
citizens, those who cannot afford high prices and who cannot flee
their neighborhood market for distant lower prices,'' Van de Kamp
said.
   American has said the deal would result in lower prices because
of the efficiency of a larger operation.
   Van de Kamp sought a temporary court order blocking the
American-Lucky combination until a trial, but U.S. District Judge
David V. Kenyon delayed a decision until Tuesday so he could study
the case.
   Meanwhile, Van de Kamp's staff continued to negotiate with Vons
on a settlement of similar allegations about the El Monte-based
grocery chain's $408 million purchase of 172 Safeway stores in
Southern California. Vons already has started converting the stores.
   Van de Kamp said the talks appeared to be making progress, but
warned he would take Vons to court immediately if the negotiations
broke down.
   American, which recently moved its corporate headquarters from
Salt Lake City to Irvine, Calif., is one of the nation's largest
supermarket companies. Its holdings include Acme markets on the
East Coast, Skaggs Alpha Beta, Alpha Beta and Buttery in the West
and the 27-state Osco drug chain.
   The transactions would give the combined Alpha Beta-Lucky chain
550 stores and Vons 350 stores, with the two chains together owning
half the supermarkets in the state.
   In opposing the California mergers, Van de Kamp cited a study
commissioned by his office that found the combination of American's
Alpha Beta with Lucky and the Safeway-Vons deal would increase food
prices by $400 million a year in the state.
   As a condition of its approval, the FTC required American to
sell 37 markets to competing chains to maintain competition. Vons
was required to sell 12 stores.

<TEXT>
   Washington Public Power Supply System's
executive board on Friday approved a settlement removing WPPSS from
a securities fraud case that goes to trial next week in Tucson,
Ariz.
   The board met in private for an hour and then approved the
settlement in a brief public meeting.
   The fraud lawsuit is the result of the 1983 default by WPPSS on
$2.25 billion worth of bonds sold to begin construction on two
nuclear power plants in Washington state. The plants were
abandoned, only partially complete, in 1982.
   Removal of WPPSS from the case leaves 21 Washington and Oregon
utilities, three engineering firms and a financial advisory firm as
defendants. Trial is scheduled to begin Wednesday in federal court.
   Ray Foleen, a member of the executive board, said WPPSS'
settlement could be the first step in settling all remaining
bondholder claims.
   ``It's my belief it is in the best interest of the ratepayers of
the region that we get this matter settled,'' he said. ``I hope the
supply system's action will be a positive element in the region and
become a catalyst for further reasonable settlement.''
   By leaving the case, the supply system will save millions of
dollars in legal costs. It already has spent more than $23 million
over five years to get to trial, and had budgeted $7 million more
for a year of trial.
   Much of WPPSS' trial-cost savings, however, are expected to be
picked up by remaining defendants.
