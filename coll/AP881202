   A 74-year-old woman was convicted
of killing another woman by trying to exorcise the devil from her
and was sentenced to six years in a psychiatric institution.
   The Constance regional court convicted Magdalena Maria Kohler on
Thursday of causing the death of a 66-year-old widow over five years
of exorcism rites. Mrs. Kohler told the court she believed the
victim was possessed by the devil.
   Anna Wermuthaeuser's bruised body was found at Mrs. Kohler's home
in February. An autopsy revealed she had been beaten for years.
   Mrs. Kohler admitted during testimony that she had locked the
victim in her room, saying Mrs. Wermuthaeuser had ``gone crazy'' and
that the devil had spoken through her.
   She denied beating the victim.
   Mrs. Kohler was convicted in Zurich in 1969 and sentenced to 10
years in prison in connection with another exorcism rite that
claimed the life of a teen-age girl.

<HEAD>Bottle of Wine Sells For $30,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 177-year-old bottle of French wine sold for
$30,525. ``The buyer hasn't told me what he's going to do with it,
but if he has any sense he will probably drink it,'' said Christie's
auctioneer Michael Broadbent.
   The buyer at Thursday's auction was a Swiss bidding by telephone
who did not want his name published. The seller was Peter Gerlach
Hansen of Vedbaek, Denmark.
   The wine in an old green bottle was a Sauterne dated 1811 from
the Chateau Yquem vineyards south of Bordeaux.
   ``We expected to get over 10,000 pounds ($18,500) for it,'' said
Broadbent.
   ``The 1811 vintage was highly successful in every European wine
district and as there was a comet that year, it is known as the
comet vintage. It is as celebrated as the vintages of 1784 and 1847,
and arguably is the most renowned of all time,'' the auctioneer said.
   Broadbent said Christie's had not sold a similar bottle but that
he had tasted one two years ago.
   ``It had a lovely color with a warm glow and a raisiny bouquet,
full of flavor and life _ a beautiful drink and a rare experience,''
the auctioneer said.
   The record price paid for a bottle of wine is 105,000 pounds,
then about $150,000, for a 1787 Chateau Lafite red, sold Dec. 5,
1985. The bottle had been initialed for dispatch to Thomas
Jefferson, but it was never delivered.

   Acting on an optimistic weather
report, NASA decided to try again Friday to send Atlantis on the
secret military mission that was scrubbed Thursday because of
violently shifting 104 mph winds in the shuttle's flight path.
   Officials were briefed by weather experts late Thursday and
shortly before midnight workers began refueling the spacecraft for a
launch Friday during a three-hour period beginning at 6:32 a.m. EST.
   NASA spokesman Dick Young said the launch management team was
``very upbeat'' about prospects for Friday because the weather
system that postponed liftoff Thursday ``has left the area.''
   ``The upper winds are essentially more benign than they were
today,'' Young said. He added that surface winds were expected to be
an acceptable 10 knots out of the north at the opening of the window
but would ``tend to become more marginal at the end of the period.''
   Earlier, Air Force weathermen had said there was a 70 percent
chance that winds would not interfere again if Atlantis could be
launched soon after sunrise.
   Should Friday's launch have to be scrubbed, NASA would have to
wait until Sunday to try again. The space agency's policy prohibits
putting work crews through the hectic launch schedule three days in
a row.
   Navy Cmdr. Robert L. Gibson and his four-man military crew,
dressed in uncomfortable, bulky escapet suits, had been lying on
their backs in cabin seats for nearly five hours Thursday when the
decision was made to scrub.
   ``They took it in stride, so did the rest of the team,'' said
launch director Bob Sieck. ``We've been talking about the threat of
this ... so it came as no surprise.''
   The astronauts themselves were not heard from publicly because
NASA, operating under strict Air Force secrecy requirements, did not
carry the usual shuttle-to-launch control conversations over its
radio circuit.
   Using all the resources at its command _ high-altitude weather
balloons, radar, and a shuttle pilot flying through the clouds _
NASA continuously sampled the weather before finally calling it
quits.
   ``We were watching the weather all the way and finally scrubbed
due to the winds aloft,'' Sieck said. ``There was no hope we were
going to get out of the situation.''
   Rain had left the area and skies had begun clearing, but eight
miles above the Atlantic Ocean winds exceeded hurricane force.
Lawrence B. Williams, a NASA engineer, said the blasts were so
powerful and erratic that the shuttle's computer could not be
programmed to safely adjust its flight path.
   Such winds could cause serious damage to the shuttle's wings.
   Col. John Madura, an Air Force weatherman, said the storm front
that caused the problems would be offshore Friday but could be
followed by strong ground winds that might affect a launch.
   Sources said the countdown, blacked out publicly for security
reasons, had been held twice for one-hour periods. It was allowed to
proceed to the nine-minute-to-launch mark so that quick advantage
could be taken of a break in the weather.
   None came.
   After the scrub, technicians immediately started draining the
half-million gallons of supercold fuel that feed the shuttle's three
main engines.
   NASA's practice is to go through the loading and unloading cycle
only twice in a 48-hour period, then calling a two-day break to give
technicians a rest. So if weather interfered again with a fueled
shuttle on Friday, the liftoff would be delayed at least until
Sunday.
   The scrub extended Gibson's unenviable shuttle record for suiting
up and getting ready to fly, only to be disappointed. As commander
of the 24th space shuttle mission, he had boarded his ship,
Columbia, six times before it finally made the flight.
   NASA had known for days that bad weather was expected at this
seaside space port Thursday morning, but it gambled on beating the
one-in-five odds that weathermen gave for acceptable conditions. The
scrub cost of fueling-draining-refueling, of having ships waiting to
retrieve the booster rockets and a myriad of other launch activities
has been estimated at $250,000.
   Atlantis' mission is only the second since the Challenger
explosion on Jan. 28, 1986, that killed seven astronauts.
   Though neither NASA nor the Air Force will discuss the caro,
sources said the shuttle is to launch a $500 million spy satellite
called Lacrosse. The sources said the satellite carries a powerful
new radar that is able to penetrate clouds and gather images of
military targets in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Lacrosse is
expected to act as the radar ``eye in the sky'' for the new B-2
stealth bomber.

   Many of the bars, cafes and hotels where Fidel
Castro lived and plotted his successful invasion of Cuba three
decades ago are gone, but a few people still remember the bearded
revolutionary _ or think they do.
   Castro lived here for 18 months as an exile, but where he took
his meals and hung out are questions that only he, or maybe his
younger brother Raul, can say for certain.
   Castro returned to Mexico City on Wednesday for the first time in
32 years, this time for Thursday's inauguration of Carlos Salinas de
Gortari. It was clear he had fond memories as he strode off his
plane to a red-carpet welcome and saluted the crowd jovially.
   ``This is my second homeland, I'm thrilled to be back,'' said
Castro, 61.
   When he first arrived here on July 8, 1955, Castro was an almost
penniless young lawyer. His sister, Lidia, had to sell her
refrigerator to raise money for the trip from Havana.
   Fidel and his brother, Raul, had just spent almost two years in a
Cuban prison for leading an unsuccessful but now legendary attack on
the Moncada barracks in a first effort to overthrow dictator
Fulgencio Batista.
   The brothers quickly set to work organizing a network of Cuban
exiles into a secret invading force. They lived as inconspicuously
as possible, although the Cuban Embassy naval attache did take
notice and made several inquiries about them with Mexican
authorities.
   ``They weren't important people and there were a lot of exiles
here in those days. So there was no reason for anyone to take much
notice of them,'' said a retired military officer who worked in
security for a time. He asked to remain anonymous.
   One of the few who remembers Castro is Filiberto Clemente, the
cashier at the Bar Latino, a block from the Inter-American Regional
Labor Organization.
   ``They used to sit there,'' Clemente, 52, said in a recent
interview, pointing to a corner table. ``I was very young then, a
sort of waiter's helper.''
   ``Castro _ Fidel, I mean _ used to eat Spanish food. He drank
little, cognac sometimes. And also manzanilla, a (sherry-like)
Spanish drink,'' Clemente said. ``He used to live a few blocks from
here, at the Hotel Oxford.''
   At Hotel Oxford's seedy bar, a white-haired barkeeper in her
mid-60s also said she remembered Castro.
   ``He used to come here often because a lot of Cuban girls were
living here at the time. But he did not live here,'' said the woman,
who refused to give her name.
   ``He lived around the corner, at the Hotel Mariscala, which used
to be known before as La Casa de la Zorra,'' she added. The Hotel
Mariscala is gone.
   Castro is supposed to have had breakfast often at the Cafe
Habana, around the corner from a gym where the conspirators worked
out daily.
   The Habana still stands on the corner of Morelos Avenue and
Bucarelli Street, but the last owner and the old cook both died
recently.
   At the Labor Organization, Castro used to chat with other Latin
American exiles, among them Luis Alberto Monge, the organization's
general secretary, and Romulo Betancourt. Monge later became as
president of Costa Rica and Betancourt of Venezuela.
   As his movement grew to about 60 fighters, Castro split them into
secret cells of 10 each and moved them to separate safe-houses.
   Among those Castro enlisted was Alberto Bayo, a Cuban-born
officer who fought with the Republican army during the Spanish Civil
War.
   In his memoirs, Bravo wrote the Cubans trained by jogging along
Insurgentes Avenue, Mexico City's main north-south thoroughfare, and
by climbing Iztaccihuatl and Popocatepetl, two volcanoes to the
southeast.
   The Cubans moved to a rundown ranch near Chalco, a town 21 miles
southeast of the capital, and continued training while disguised as
workmen.
   On June 20, 1956, Castro and two of his men were arrested, and on
July 2 police raided the ranch and arrested a dozen fighters. They
were released with help from former Mexican President Lazaro
Cardenas, a leftist sympathizer and a power in Mexican politics.
   Cardenas was the father of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the man Salinas
beat in a disputed election July 6. Many Mexican leftists feel
Castro is lending support to an illegitimate government by attending
the Salinas inauguration.
   Castro and his men ended up on the Yucatan Peninsula, 122 miles
from Cuba, where they bought a battered 38-foot yacht, the Granma,
from an American named Robert B. Erickson.
   The small band of Cubans repaired the boat and set off on a
stormy nine-day trip to Cuba and into history on Nov. 16, 1956. A
25-month guerrilla war followed, until Batista fled and Castro
seized power on Jan. 1, 1959.

<HEAD>Suburban Philadelphia Residents Say $1,000 Parking Tickets Are A
Crime</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HORSHAM, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Ricci was incredulous when a
policeman slapped his son with a $1,000 parking ticket for illegal
parking in front of the family home.
   ``I flipped,'' Ricci, a retired policeman himself, said recently.
   But neither he nor others ticketed under a new ordinance are
getting sympathy from officials in this suburban Philadelphia
township, where an ordinance passed Sept. 13 specifies the fine _
and court costs of $23 _ in an effort to keep narrow cul-de-sacs
clear for emergency vehicles.
   ``If a fire engine cannot get in there because of the way cars
are parked, there is a danger to the lives of the people,'' said
township Solicitor Thomas Del Ricci. ``When you consider the value
of human life, I don't think $1,000 is unreasonable.''
   Ricci's 25-year-old son, Ken, was tightening battery cables under
the hood when an officer approached him Nov. 22. Moments later, he
was showing his father the citation.
   The elder Ricci, who retired to Horsham from Philadelphia
``because I wanted peace and tranquility,'' has company in his
disbelief.
   ``We were astounded,'' said Tom Cowgill, an insurance agent who
was ticketed that same night when he and his wife, Betty, were
visiting their grandchildren.``I thought it was ridiculous, but talk
to my wife and you'll hear a different story. They were scraping her
off the wall.''
   At least 11 car owners have received thousand-dollar tickets so
far.
   Del Ricci said judges have discretion to suspend part of the
fine. But District Justice Richard M. Price, who expects to be
hearing the cases, said the way the ordinance was written requires
him to assess the full $1,000.
   The first court hearings are scheduled for the end of December,
but Price said he expects the Township Council, which meets Tuesday,
to change the ordinance and give him some flexibility.
   ``I hope this comes out as funny as it seems,'' said Cowgill,
``because I'm not going to pay that $1,000. You might have to visit
me in jail at Christmas.''

<TEXT>
   Former President Chun Doo-hwan spends
his days in exile in an isolated Buddhist temple living the way his
ancestors might have _ sleeping on a mat, reading by candlelight,
chopping wood for heat and praying.
   While many Koreans are riveted by televised parliamentary
hearings probing corruption and human rights abuses under his
presidency, Chun passes his days in the timeless pattern of Buddhist
monks, sharing a solitude that is centuries old.
   In the isolated 14th century temple Chun and his wife sought as
refuge, there is no television, no telephone, and the toilet is a
temporary latrine set up outside his room.
   ``I made a great mistake,'' Chun was quoted as telling monks at
Paektam-sa mountain retreat, five hours drive east of Seoul. ``I
hope that future generations learn a lesson and do not repeat the
same mistakes.''
   The former president left Seoul to go into internal exile Nov. 23
after apologizing to the nation on national television for abuses of
power. Dissatisfied dissidents and students have staged mass
protests demanding his arrest and return to Seoul for punishment.
   Rural exile is a traditional form of repentance for disgraced
Korean officials. President Roh Tae-woo hopes Chun's banishment will
persuade Koreans to forgive the former general who took power with
military backing in 1980.
   Chun has denied any personal wrongdoing, but took moral
responsibility for widespread corruption and abuses under his tough
rule. Many Koreans detest the man who ruled with an iron fist for
more than seven years.
   The temple is in a northeast region called Sorak, or ``Snow
Hills,'' a tourist idyll of picturesque mountains, forests,
waterfalls and deep ravines. There, temples such as Paektam-sa have
sheltered many political refugees in Korea's turbulent 5,000-year
history.
   Makeshift guard posts for Chun's bodyguards and about 200
security police dot the perimeter of the grounds. Police increased
security after several dozen radical students tried to storm the
gate.
   Head monk Kim Do-kong said he did not know the former president
was coming until a few hours before his arrival. Kim said he has
been told his guests want to avoid contact with outsiders, and with
few exceptions they have.
   Chun and his wife talked with reporters the day they arrived, but
since have kept to themselves and have not left the temple grounds.
A daughter, her husband and several friends have visited.
   Korean reporters say visitors usually arrive with faces covered
to hide their identity.
   Meals, cooked by the monks, are vegetarian dishes such as boiled
rice, soybean soup, sesame leaves and the spicy, pickled Korean
cabbage called kimchi.
   Reading is by candlelight. Chun reportedly has at least 15 books
in his room including some on Buddhism and one called ``Leadership
and Politics in Korea.''
   He was seen in fur cap and parka chopping wood for fuel.
   Temperatures in the mountains have been below freezing and heavy
snowfalls in January and February usually cut off Paektam-sa.
   Monks at the temple rise before dawn and say 4:30 a.m. prayers,
kneeling before a statue of Buddha. They say Chun and his wife, Lee
Soon-ja, have joined them.
   The monks say Chun told them he sleeps ``peacefully, without
insomnia'' and appreciates the time to walk in the wooded grounds.
   Reporters given a tour of the Chun quarters said the bare
71-square-feet room is a traditional temple accommodation for guests
with a small mahogany table and Korean floor bedding. Two black
leather cushions and a small vinyl dresser were added specially for
the Chuns.
   Three white towels and a set of winter underwear hung from a
string on the wall, the Korea Times said, and some cosmetics were on
the dresser.
   While Chun stays in rural isolation, a major drive is underway in
Seoul to expunge him from the nation's life and even its history
books.
   In the last week, Chun has resigned formally from the ruling
Democatic Justice Party which he founded in 1981. And the Ministry
of Education announced his photographs and some material lauding
achievements of his government would be deleted from school
textbooks.

<HEAD>US Orders American Soldiers Out Of UN Group In Lebanon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration has ordered all
American military officers out of the United Nations unit that
patrols southern Lebanon, saying the risk to U.S. soldiers has risen
too high despite their affiliation with the international
peacekeeping group.
   The decision, disclosed Thursday by senior administration
officials who asked not to be named, was attributed to a recent
internal review that concluded the risk to U.S. soldiers had
``simply grown too great.''
   ``The situation inside Lebanon is not improving and wearing a
U.N. badge doesn't mean anything,'' said one source.
   The administration's decision affects a unit known as the
Observer Group Lebanon of the U.N. Truce Supervision Organization,
or UNTSO.
   It was not immediately clear Thursday whether any single recent
development in Lebanon had prompted the withdrawal order. Two
officials insisted not, saying the order stemmed from ``a
comprehensive review of the situation that was just completed.''
   Nine months ago, a U.S. Marine officer assigned to the group was
kidnapped. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, at the time the
senior American officer assigned to the group, disappeared last Feb.
17 while driving on a coastal road between the Lebanese city of Tyre
and the border town of Naqoura.
   He became the ninth American to be seized as a hostage in
Lebanon, all apparently by pro-Iranian Moslem fundamentalists.
   The administration sources said Thursday the Americans assigned
to Observer Group Lebanon were ordered out over the past week.
   ``They are no longer in southern Lebanon,'' said one source.
``They've been withdrawn over the last several days.''
   ``It's too risky,'' said another official. ``The risk to our
people is now considered too high and we don't want them traveling
inside Lebanon.''
   UNTSO has an authorized strength of 299 military personnel, who
are drawn from 17 nations. The United States and the Soviet Union
each provide 36 men. Of the 36 Americans assigned to UNTSO, 16 have
normally been assigned to the Observer Group Lebanon.
   Neither the Defense Department nor the State Department would
discuss the matter publicly Thursday.
   The sources said, however, the decision had been coordinated
between the two departments and the White House and that the United
States had informed the United Nations it hoped to resume
participation in the Observer Group Lebanon ``when conditions in
southern Lebanon permit.''
   The administration also made clear it would continue to support
all other U.N. operations in the region, the sources said.
   UNTSO was organized to observe and maintain the cease-fire
ordered by the U.N. Security Council in July 1948 following Israel's
creation and supervise the general armistice agreements between
Jordan, Syria, Egypt, Lebanon and Israel.
   It serves as the focal point for all U.N. Middle East
peacekeeping operations and monitors cease-fire violations along the
Israeli borders.
   The United States has quietly reduced the number of Americans
actually patrolling with the U.N. unit inside Lebanon since Higgins'
kidnapping.
   But the administration had adamantly denied having any plans to
withdraw American soldiers from the team entirely, stressing the
need to demonstrate U.S. support for the peacekeeping efforts.
   A third source noted that under normal rotation procedures, an
American would be expected to assume command of Observer Group
Lebanon in January and ``that timetable might have played a role.''
   The State Department, in response to the continuing civil strife
in Lebanon and the fighting between Christians and Moslems, long ago
ordered all American civilians out of Lebanon and trimmed the staff
of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut. Only between 10 and 30 people now are
assigned to the embassy, officials say.

<HEAD>Defense Appointment Still On Hold</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush acknowledges his
selection of a defense secretary has been moving at a slower pace
than expected, saying apparent front-runner John Tower ``knows that
the process takes a while.''
   Last week, Bush's designated chief of staff, John Sununu,
indicated the president-elect would name his defense team this week.
   But the only appointment Bush has made in five days is that of
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, who will keep the job he now
holds.
   Bush was also expected to move swiftly on his secretary of
commerce, with most bets on Robert Mosbacher, a Houston oilman who
is close to the vice president.
   Sources at the Bush transition office, speaking on condition they
not be named, said Mosbacher's appointment has been slowed because
of the background checks required for him and his numerous
businesses.
   In the case of Tower, the former Texas senator, there has
reportedly been infighting in the Bush camp over his appointment.
Speculation is that Bush wants to get his defense team in place
before he names Tower.
   ``We're trying to be prudent and do the proper work required to
back up appointments at all levels,'' Bush said Thursday.
   Bush was asked about the reports that Tower is a paid consultant
to several major defense contractors.
   ``Any time there seems to be stories that may be hurtful to
somebody it concerns me no matter who it is,'' he said. ``Senator
Tower's a friend of mine but he knows that the process takes a while
to go forward.''
   _ In other transition news, the name of former Wyoming House
Speaker Warren Morton has surfaced as a possible secretary of the
interior. Environmentalists object to Morton, whom they consider too
pro-development.
   Another possibility is Bob Broadbent, director of the Las Vegas,
Nev., airport and former commissioner of the bureau of reclamation.
Sen. Dan Evans of Washington has also been mentioned, as has
Michigan Gov. Bob Milliken.
   Some conservatives are also pushing Robert Teeter, the
co-director of the transition office, for the post at interior.
Teeter has been offered the position of deputy White House chief of
staff, but he hasn't accepted it yet.
   _ Evans is also mentioned for energy secretary, but former
Louisiana Rep. Henson Moore's name is heard more often.
   _ Mike Deland, the regional Environmental Protection Agency
administrator in Boston, is still the leading candidate. Francis
Blake, former agency general counsel, is also a possiblity.
   _ The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, is pushing
former Transporation Secretary Elizabeth Dole to become the U.N.
ambassasdor. She is the wife of Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan.
   _ Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, a failed GOP presidential
candidate, is reportedly eyeing the job as secretary of Housing and
Urban Development. Both Bush and President Reagan attended a
testimonial dinner for Kemp Thursday night.
   _ Rep. Bob Dornan, a hard-line conservative from California, has
let it be known that he'd like to be the new drug czar in the Bush
administration. A new name also surfaced for that post, former
baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth. Ueberroth was once mentioned
for the job at Commerce, but that's apparently Mosbacher's for the
taking.

   Lyndon LaRouche's rent for two residences
was paid by a publishing company that considered the perennial
presidential candidate its ``prime asset,'' according to testimony
at his tax fraud trial.
   Marielle Kronberg, former chief operating officer of the
publishing house, told jurors Thursday that she made the payments as
an expression of gratitude for the firm's best-selling author _ not
as a substitute for taxable royalties.
   The prosecution contends that the rent payments should have been
declared as taxable income, along with household and personal
services purchased for LaRouche by his organizations over the last
decade.
   The political eccentric is charged with conspiring to defraud the
Internal Revenue Service by failing to declare personal financial
assistance as income, and by failing to file income tax returns
beginning in 1979.
   In addition, LaRouche and six associates are charged with
conspiring to defraud people who lent LaRouche organizations some
$30 million, by intentionally failing to repay the bulk of the money.
   Two other witnesses told jurors in U.S. District Court on
Thursday that LaRouche was waited upon hand-and-foot by employees
who cooked for him, his wife and his dogs, bought his clothes,
cleaned his house and performed concerts for him.
   Before the two-week-old trial recessed until Monday, Ms. Kronberg
identified a $900 rent check for a residence used by LaRouche in
Michigan in 1980, and a $5,100 rent check for an apartment he used
in New York City the next year.
   The checks came from the New Benjamin Franklin Publishing Co. in
New York City. Ms. Kronberg said LaRouche was not involved in the
company's operation.
   The indictment identifies the firm as a company established
``ostensibly for the purpose of publishing the work of LaRouche''
and members of his political movement.
   Asked by Assistant U.S. Attorney Kent Robinson why she made the
rent payments, Ms. Kronberg said, ``Because he was our principal
author and in that sense our prime asset.''
   ``I didn't think it was in lieu of paying'' royalties to
LaRouche, she testified, adding that many others also used the New
York apartment.
   Ms. Kronberg said the publishing firm did write checks to
LaRouche totaling $6,000 for royalty payments, but said she learned
they were never cashed.
   The indictment says LaRouche signed a 1980 federal tax return
showing $7,963 in taxable income, including the $6,000 in uncashed
royalty checks. But the return was never filed.
   Another witness, Pam Cowdery, testified that she played the
violin and sang at LaRouche's Leesburg, Va., estate when he and his
wife ``just wanted to hear some music.''
   The former employee of a LaRouche graphic company also said she
cooked for the LaRouches, helped clean the house and even prepared
``very special meals'' of boned chicken breasts for the couple's
dogs.
   LaRouche's security chief, Richard Magraw, testified that
LaRouche carried no money, and said he would buy suits, underwear,
tobacco and even haircuts for his balding boss from a ``security''
fund.
   Magraw testified under a grant of limited immunity from
prosecution.
   On trial with LaRouche are his chief fund-raiser William Wertz;
his legal adviser, Edward Spannaus; and four fund-raisers: Michael
Billington, Dennis Small, Paul Greenberg and Joyce Rubinstein.

<HEAD>Illinois Candidate Says D.C. Job was Stuffing Envelopes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressman's son who was running for office
in Illinois while on the payroll of the District of Columbia's
delegate to Congress says his House job consisted of little more
than stuffing envelopes on a part-time basis.
   Thomas John Savage's job came under scrutiny after The Associated
Press reported Tuesday that he claimed residency in Chicago and was
running for an Illinois House seat while on the payroll of Del.
Walter Fauntroy, the district's non-voting delegate to Congress.
   Savage, son of Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill., earned $21,398 while on
Fauntroy's payroll between September 1987 and June 1988.
   In order to run for state representative in Illinois, he had
filed a sworn statement declaring that he had lived continuously for
two years in the district he sought to represent.
   House rules, meanwhile, say employees may work only in the
member's office or district _ in Fauntroy's case, the nation's
capital.
   When the issue was raised, Fauntroy said Savage worked diligently
on behalf of a bill that would have granted statehood to the
district. But on Thursday, Savage told The Washington Post that he
did no work on statehood, and only showed up for work on a part-time
basis.
   ``We didn't call out much (on statehood issues),'' Savage told
the Post. He said he spent most of his time at work ``putting
packages (of statehood material) together and getting them out.''
   The rest of the time, Savage said, he spent ``working around the
Hill,'' occasionally attending a hearing or dropping by the House
District of Columbia offices.
   Fauntroy was not immediately available to comment on the apparent
contradiction between his and Savage's assessment of Savage's job
duties.
   The latest disagreement followed statements by Savage that he had
lobbied congressmen on the statehood effort; Fauntroy had said
Savage had been working with grassroots organizers.
   Fauntroy also said Savage used House District of Columbia
Committee offices and phones to do his lobbying work, but Capitol
Hill staffers said Thursday that Savage did not use their offices.
City officials active in the statehood movement said they had never
met or heard of him.
   D.C. Council Chairman David Clarke and council members Hilda
Mason and Betty Ann Kane, all three of whom are active on statehood
issues, said they did not remember meeting Savage.
   Others have placed Savage in Chicago at the time he was on
Fauntroy's payroll and living in Washington.
   House rules require employees to regularly report to work in the
member's Capitol Hill or district offices. Illinois election laws
require candidates to live continuously for two years in the
district they intend to represent. Savage signed an affidavit three
months after he went to work for Fauntroy verifying his residency in
Illinois.

<HEAD>Pentagon Breaks Link Between Computer Systems After `Hacker'</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Invades
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department severed the electronic
links between two of its computer networks this week after an
unknown ``hacker'' gained entry to a contractor's computer, the
Pentagon said.
   Neither of the computer networks involved handled classified data
or information, but the links between the two were ``temporarily
severed ... in order to provide a barrier to protect users,'' the
department said Thursday.
   The connections between the Arpanet network, which links academic
and corporate computer centers, and the so-called Milnet system,
which links thousands of military computers, were severed Monday.
   The Pentagon said the connection was broken after ``an
unidentified hacker penetrated a VAX computer belonging to a defense
contractor on the night of Nov. 27-28, 1988.''
   ``The hacker used a weakness in the end user's computer software.
The `fix' for this problem has been developed by the vendor and is
available electronically to users of the software,'' the Pentagon
said.
   The Pentagon did not identify the contractor, but a spokeswoman
for the Mitre Corp. in Bedford, Mass., Marcia Cohen, said one of the
company's computers had been entered.
   Arpanet is the same unclassified computer network that was
crippled last month when someone slipped a ``virus'' into the system
_ an incident that is being investigated by a federal grand jury in
Syracuse.

<HEAD>More than 40 Jewish Dissidents Notified Barrier To Emigration Being</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Removed
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 42 Jews have been told by Soviet
authorities that the barrier to their emigration is being removed,
according to the National Conference on Soviet Jewry.
   The Jews had previously been denied exit permits on grounds of
state secrecy.
   Assistant Secretary of State Richard Shifter said Thursday he
heard of the barrier being lifted from Jewish sources. He said he
had no official confirmation from Moscow.
   The move followed the apparent ending of Soviet jamming of
American-financed Russian language broadcasts. Together, the two
steps represent a major improvement in human rights by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev before his meeting next week with
President Reagan and President-elect George Bush.
   Among the ``refuseniks'' informed of the change was Yuli
Kosharovsky, who has been waiting for more than 17 years for
permission to go to Israel. He had been denied a visa for classified
work he performed as an electronics engineer until 1968.
   The Jewish group announced, meanwhile, that 2,334 Soviet Jews had
been granted exit permits in November _ the largest monthly total
this year. Permits this year total 15,640, making the exodus the
biggest since 1980.

   Police said they were investigating whether
steel rods found near railway tracks caused a train crash that
killed the wives of the Jersey City and Cuzco mayors and injured the
politicians.
   A railway car carrying the couples careened off tracks in the
Andes and tumbled down a ravine Thursday.
   Officials of the state railroad company Enafer and police said
steel rods were found near the derailment site. Police said they
were looking into reports someone might have planted the rods to
cause an accident during a daylong nationwide strike Thursday.
   They said the likely target was a passenger train that was behind
the tourist train, which was making an unscheduled trip.
   Mayor Anthony Cucci of Jersey City, N.J., and Mayor Carlos Chacon
of Cuzco, their wives and six other people were on an outing to the
Inca citadel of Machu Picchu when the crash occurred Thursday,
officials said.
   Authorities said Anna Cucci, about 60, and Doris Chacon, 58, died
in the 3:30 p.m. crash.
   The suvivors were treated at Cuzco's Regional Hospital.
   Dr. Luis Garcia, hospital director, said Cucci, 66, was suffering
from multiple bruises but was in stable condition and appeared to be
out of danger.
   Garcia said Chacon was in serious condition with multiple
fractures and internal bleeding. Chacon underwent surgery late
Thursday, the hospital said.
   Jersey City Councilman Jaime Vasquez, who was also on board, told
reporters he suffered minor injuries.
   The Cuccis arrived in Cuzco on Thursday morning and planned to
participate in a sister city celebration honoring Jersy City and
Cuzco, Vasquez said.
   Officials said the conditions of the five other people in the car
were not immediately available, but they were not believed to have
been seriously injured.
   The vehicle, a modified version of an 11-passenger bus outfitted
for rail travel, crashed about six miles outside Cuzco, a tourist
area 355 miles southeast of Lima, police said.
   The rail car had left Cuzco about 2:45 p.m. on a specially
scheduled trip to Machu Picchu, 60 miles northwest of Cuzco.
   Police said the vehicle derailed and traveled about 30 feet along
the tracks before going over a hill and tumbling 250 feet down a
ravine.
   Some passengers apparently were able to escape before the car
began rolling. Garcia said preliminary indications were that the
women died of skull fractures.
   They said the likely target of possible sabotage was a passenger
train that uses the same tracks to carry residents between Cuzco and
Quillabamba, 20 miles beyond Machu Picchu.
   That passenger train left the Cuzco station shortly after the
tourist car, officials said.
   In an effort to paralyze business activity, strikers Thursday
blocked a mountain road between the cities with logs and rocks,
officials said, adding possible saboteurs might have wanted to
completely severe transportation by derailing the passenger train.
   Machu Picchu is a citadel hidden on a jungle mountaintop.
   In June 1986, a bomb exploded on a train headed for Machu Picchu.
Eight people, including an American, were killed. Guerrillas of the
Maoist Shining Path were suspected of planting the bomb.

   A man wanted in a New Mexico
rampage that claimed three lives was arrested Thursday night after a
security guard at Universal Studios was shot to death and another
was wounded, authorities said.
   Nathan Nick Trupp, 42, the subject of a nationwide manhunt
following the shooting deaths Tuesday at a bagel shop in an
Albuquerque shopping mall, was shot and wounded Thursday by Los
Angeles County sheriff's deputies, said Deputy Roger Hom.
   The gunman walked up to a guard shack at an employees entrance to
Universal Studios shortly before 6 p.m. and opened fire, officials
said.
   Minutes later, deputies and a third guard spotted a man they
believed to be the gunman about a block away and ``engaged in a
gunbattle,'' wounding the man, said Van Mosley, a sheriff's
spokesman at the scene.
   What provoked the shooting was not immediately known. ``We have
absolutely no clues,'' said Dan Slusser, general manager of the
studio, a popular tourist attraction.
   Trupp was in critical condition at St. Joseph Medical Center in
nearby Burbank after surgery for gunshot wounds to his chest and
arm, said nursing supervisor Eric Chew.
   Home identified the dead guard as Jason Beeks, 27, of La
Crescenta. The wounded guard, 20-year-old Armando Torres, was in
critical condition with a gunshot wound to the head at St. Joseph's,
Chew said.
   Universal Studios, 10 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, is
home to the Universal Studios amusement park, and movie and
television studios and offices.

   Inaugural day protests in Congress and in the
streets of this restive capital marred the beginning of President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari's six-year term.
   Salinas, promising political and economic reforms, said Thursday
in his inaugural speech to Congress that ``my administration will
respond to the citizens' demand for respect for (political)
plurality and effective participation.''
   Salinas' July 6 presidential victory, the narrowest in the
59-year history of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party,
or PRI, has been clouded by allegations the election was fraught
with fraud and vote-tampering.
   Defying heavy deployment of army troops, police and plainclothes
security guards, thousands who claim the PRI deprived Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas of victory in the election held scattered demonstrations.
Unlike previous demonstrations, many protesters carried sharpened
sticks.
   Police used tear gas to break up a demonstration by 1,500 people
in Zocalo Plaza outside the National Palace, where Salinas went
after the inauguration. About 150 people, including some police and
soldiers, were injured but none were hospitalized, Red Cross
paramedic Carlos Daniel Ramirez said.
   As Salinas spoke, a crowd of several thousand threw rocks at
police outside the Legislative Palace. Several demonstrators and
policemen were reported injured.
   One police department employee said there were ``many'' arrests,
but police spokesmen refused to give figures.
   A crowd of 6,000 marched about 1{ miles cheering Cardenas, who
defeated Salinas in populous Mexico City but finished second
nationally to the president.
   According to the official tally, Salinas won just over 50 percent
of the vote, with Cardenas getting 31 percent, and Manuel Clouthier
of the conservative National Action Party a distant third with 17
percent.
   ``It falls to us to create the conditions so that this government
... leaves the National Palace and that it is occupied by the
people,'' Cardenas told the crowd.
   Cardenas supporters occupied at least 19 city halls in his home
state of Michoacan last week to demand the ouster of the Michoacan
governor and staged protests outside 20 others.
   Protesters outside the Legislative Palace said police removed 200
to 300 people early Thursday and left them outside city limits.
Alberta Torres Sanchez, 75, claimed police put her on a bus to
Puebla, 65 miles southeast of the capital. She said she took another
bus back to rejoin demonstrators.
   Just before Salinas, 40, was sworn in, about 140 congressmen from
the four parties making up Cardenas' National Democratic Front
walked out.
   ``Only the vote can legitimize him!'' shouted one congressman as
the group filed out.
   The congressional delegation of the conservative National Action
Party, which has not recognized Salinas' victory but says he can
redeem himself by performing well in office, remained through the
speech.
   At the end of his speech, however, the delegation of 40 raised
signs telling Salinas to ``show with actions your pledge to
democracy.''
   Under an agreement with the PRI, leaders of the two opposition
blocs were allowed to make televised pre-inaugural speeches critical
of Salinas' election in return for a promise not to interrupt the
ceremony.
   ``I take office in a complex hour: between collective hope and
the weight of accumulated sacrifices; between the need for building
for the future and the pressure for immediate accomplishments,''
Salinas said. ``It is a singular moment in our history, heavy with
risks but rich in opportunity.''
   Six years of austerity under a program Salinas designed as budget
secretary under Miguel de la Madrid cut workers' buying power by
more than half. It combined with years of slowly mounting discontent
with government corruption and elections where the result was a
foregone conclusion _ victory for the PRI.
   To recover the economic initiative, Salinas said he had given
orders to Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe to begin negotiating new
terms with international banks on its $102 billion foreign debt,
second highest in the developing world behind Brazil.
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who represented the
United States, applauded Salinas' address.
   ``Here was a man who loved his country with a passion and has a
clear understanding of the opportunities and the problems ahead and
is ready to roll up his sleeves and go to work,'' Shultz said after
meeting with Salinas.

college-age daughter on ``The Cosby Show,'' has given birth to a
healthy baby girl, says a spokesman for her husband, musician Lenny
Kravitz.
   ``All are well and are resting comfortably at home,'' publicist
Stephen Smith said Thursday.
   Zoe Kravitz, weighing 7 pounds, 2 ounces, was delivered at 2 a.m.
Thursday at the couple's canal-front home in suburban Venice Beach,
Smith said.
   Miss Bonet rose to fame as Denise Huxtable on NBC's
family-oriented ``The Cosby Show.'' She gained notoriety by posing
semi-nude for ``Rolling Stone'' and ``Interview'' magazines, and for
a torrid love scene in the film ``Angel Heart.''
   She married Kravitz, a singer and musician also known as Romeo
Blue, in Las Vegas in November 1987.

   Michael Landon took his final trip on
``Highway to Heaven'' as the NBC show completed its last day of
filming after five seasons.
   The film crew on the show has been with Landon for nearly 30
years. The crew, which began working with him on ``Bonanza'' in
1959, also worked with him on ``Little House on the Prairie'' and
``Father Murphy.''
   ``It's sad after every show ends,'' Landon said Thursday. ``But
this is like another hiatus. I'm sure we'll all be back together
again soon. We're the best unit in town.''
   Landon stars in ``Highway to Heaven'' as an angel whose good
works are assisted by an ex-policeman played by Victor French. The
show's 100th episode will be telecast Dec. 7. The final episode will
be aired early next year.

   President-elect George Bush's wife, Barbara,
has put the crowning touch on the national Christmas tree for the
eighth year in a row.
   Mrs. Bush ascended 35 feet aboard a bumpy hydraulic boom Thursday
and placed the ornament atop the Colorado blue spruce just beyond
the back fence of the White House.
   ``It's the only thing I've done more than anyone else,'' she told
a guest in a reception line afterwards. ``I love it.''
   The vice president's wife becomes the first lady next year. Does
that mean Marilyn Quayle, wife of Vice President-elect Dan Quayle,
will get the job?
   ``I would be offended if someone else did it,'' Mrs. Bush told
another guest Thursday.
   President Reagan will light the tree for his last time Dec. 15.

   Only 41 tickets have been sold for the
wrestle-and-rock music extravaganza that soul singer James Brown was
required to produce as part of his probation, but the show will go
on Sunday, organizers say.
   The Augusta-Richmond Civic Center can hold up to 7,500 people for
an event like ``Wrestle-Rock '88.'' But by 5 p.m. Thursday only 41
of the $10 tickets, which went on sale Nov. 22, had been sold, said
the center's general manager, Larry Rogers.
   ``It's probably the worst advance ticket sales I've seen since
I've been in Augusta,'' Rogers said.
   Brown's lawyer, Buddy Dallas, said the show featuring his client
would go on despite the poor sales.
   Proceeds will go to the Aiken, S.C., Fraternal Order of Police,
which accepted the show to fulfill a condition of Brown's probation.
Money will also go to Helping Hands, a shelter for abused children,
and the Leukemia Society.
   Brown was placed on probation last summer and given a suspended
sentence of 2{ years after he pleaded guilty to carrying a pistol,
resisting arrest and possession of PCP in a May 18 incident near his
Beech Island, S.C., home.

   Gregory Peck says he learned early in life that
he was the key to his own success.
   ``I was reticent and I had no self-confidence,'' said Peck, 72.
``Little by little, though, I was learning to be on my own. I
realized that if I didn't make things happen myself, no one else was
going to.''
   In the Dec. 4 issue of Parade magazine, Peck recalls how he
became a truck driver at age 18, then quit to attend San Diego State
College, where he earned grades good enough to get into the
University of California-Berkeley.
   ``From time to time I used to stop in at the Little Theatre. One
day, out of the blue, a fellow came over and said he needed a tall
actor and did I want to give it a try? I was terrible at first _
awkward and stiff and self-conscious.
   ``In one way, I hated it, and it was agonizing. But in another
and more important way, I loved it. ... (Acting) gave me the chance
to make friends with people, something that would make up for having
been a loner for so long.''

<HEAD>Police Shoot And Wound Gunman In Central London, Free Hostage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police shot and wounded a gunman in the busy
theater district today after he grabbed a bystander and held him
hostage 2{ hours, dragging him through streets lined with crowded
restaurants and pubs, Scotland Yard said.
   The hostage, who was seized in a scuffle after the gunman
apparently tried to mug someone else, was unharmed, police said.
They said the gunman was taken to a hospital with a chest wound. His
condition was not immediately known.
   More than 200 police, many carrying rifles, rushed to the
Trafalgar Square and St. Martin's lane area late Thursday where
crowds of theatergoers were either heading home or dining in
restaurants.
   Jane Chandler, a radio producer with the British Broadcasting
Corp., said she was in a pub and ran to a room upstairs to telephone
her office. She found herself sharing the room with two police
marksmen.
   ``I looked out of the window and I could see this skinhead
holding a dark-haired man around the neck and shoving a gun near his
head. The police were calling out: `Stop it, give it up.'
   ``The hostage was in a complete daze and the gunman kept dragging
him up and down the street from the Strand to Chandos Place and into
Maiden Lane...
   ``There were still people from the restaurants wandering about
and the police were trying to clear them but they were like helpless
chickens because they didn't know where he was going to go next.
   ``(Later) they (the police) had the man cornered in the alley and
I heard over the police radio an order to engage and saying they
should open fire if they had a clear shot. Then I heard the bang and
it was all over.''
   Neither the gunman nor the hostage was identified.
   Police trailed the gunman and his hostage through side roads
lined with theaters and restaurants as other officers sealed the
area, ordering pedestrians and traffic off the streets.
   An officer with a bullhorn appealed to the gunman to surrender
and release his hostage, a Scotland Yard statement said. The gunman
ignored the plea so the marksman shot him, the statement said.
   Police said the incident began at about 10.30 p.m. Thursday and
ended just after 1 a.m. on Maiden Lane, a narrow road near Trafalgar
Square in central London.
   Brian Last, manager of Rules restaurant on Maiden Lane, said
armed police told the 50 diners and staff there to stay inside with
the doors locked and keep away from the windows.
   Free-lance journalist Edmond Hall, said, ``We could see a man...
holding what looked like a small caliber revolver at a man lying
between his legs.''
   The British domestic news agency Press Association said the
gunman was thought to have tried to fire the gun several times but
that it misfired each time.

   Rivers of sliced peaches, mountains of cookies

   If all the money were spent on Oreo cookies, they would overflow
every grain elevator in Toledo, Ohio; Buffalo, N.Y.; Chicago; and
Fort Worth, Texas.
   The $24 billion would buy enough Del Monte sliced peaches to keep
Niagara Falls going at full flow for more than half an hour.
   If every dime went into Winston cigarettes, there would be enough
so F. Ross Johnson, the chief executive of RJR Nabisco who lost the
bidding, could chain-smoke for 70,000 centuries.
   Viewed another way, the $22 billion in debt that RJR Nabisco will
carry under its new ownership is greater than the combined foreign
debts of Burma, the Congo, Cyprus, Honduras, Mali, Nepal, Niger and
Oman.

   Shouts from thousands of angry demonstrators
drowned out the cheers of the few supporters who greeted Carlos
Salinas de Gortari on his presidential inauguration.
   Even uniformed police and army soldiers outnumbered the handful
of citizens who showed up Thursday along the inaugural parade route
to welcome President Salinas.
   The protesters claim Salinas, of the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party, stole the presidency in a July 6 fraud-tainted
election from Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, leader of the National Democratic
Front, an organization of four leftist parties.
   ``We know that in this country an electoral fraud was committed
and today an illegitimate presidency has been consummated,''
Cardenas told 6,000 people who gathered for the afternoon march, the
largest protest of the day.
   Cardenas urged his supporters to avoid violence and organize to
work for fair elections and nationwide democracy.
   Before dawn, authorities removed protesters from the plaza in
front of the Legislative Palace, site of the inauguration, and
bussed 200 to 300 of them out of the city, demonstrators said.
   Most were back within hours for a demonstration at the Zocalo,
Mexico City's central plaza, where police used tear gas to disperse
them again.
   A police blockade around the legislative chamber failed to
prevent angry protesters from throwing rocks at the building during
the ceremony.
   Protesters then gathered at Independence Monument for what was
planned as a silent protest, but was marked by drumbeats, catcalls
at security forces and shouts of ``Death to Salinas!''
   Many marchers carried sticks. Others wore black bows to mourn
what they called ``the death of democracy.''

<TEXT>
   An explosion rocked a Syrian-policed west
Beirut neighborhood today during the morning rush hour. At least two
people were wounded, police said.
   A police spokesman said the 8 a.m. bomb was planted under a car
only 50 yards from a Syrian army checkpoint in the Lower Mossaitbeh
district.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named in line with standing
regulations, said the explosion shattered glass in the neighborhood.
   A witness said a private car evacuated ``two wounded men from the
scene.'' Police could not say if the wounded were Syrian soldiers.
   Syrian troops, according to the witness, ``fired their automatic
rifles in the air to make way for the car carrying the wounded
men,'' then sealed off the area.
   The Moslem-run Voice of the Nation radio station, based in west
Beirut, said the explosion was caused by ``a small bomb planted
under a car parked in an empty lot near the Syrian checkpoint.''
   Syria, the main powerbroker in Lebanon, maintains about 40,000
troops in eastern and northern provinces as well as west and south
Beirut.
   The explosion may have been part of a campaign to discredit the
Syrians as peacekeepers. Scores of such attacks have been reported
since the Syrians moved into Beirut in 1986 to end militia rule.
   The blast came after a series of house raids mounted by the
Syrians to halt renewed violence between rival Shiite Moslem
factions.
   The pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the Syrian-backed
Amal, Arabic for hope, fought for six days late last month. By
police count, 40 people were killed and 87 wounded in the
confrontation.

   Woody Guthrie's songs rang out in a packed
theater at a long-delayed tribute to the composer of ``This Land Is
Your Land'' in his hometown, where some still maintain the
folk-singing great was no folk hero.
   About 50 schoolchildren and adult accompanists Thursday sang and
played fiddle, guitar, banjo, harmonica and piano in Okemah's
450-seat Crystal Theater as the audience whistled and clapped along.
   ``I sat there with chill bumps and with tears,'' said Guthrie's
65-year-old sister, Mary Jo Edgmon, who represented the Guthrie
family. His singer son, Arlo, did not attend the tribute just a few
blocks from the overgrown lot where the Guthrie family's house once
stood.
   Shows honoring the ``Dust Bowl Balladeer,'' who died in 1967,
have been held in such grand auditoriums as Carnegie Hall. But
Thursday's was the first in Okemah because people like city
councilman Bart Webb think Guthrie was more of a subversive than a
star.
   Webb, seething over the first of three tribute performances, said
he would ask the council Monday to paint over the ``Home of Woody
Guthrie'' sign painted on one of the central Oklahoma town's three
water towers facing Interstate 40.
   The ramshackle house where Guthrie's family lived before he left
Okemah at age 17 had been vandalized. Some of the graffiti scrawled
on the building called him a communist, a label his family rejects.
When the house started falling down, local officials did nothing.
   Leaders of this community of 3,300 also once opposed a move to
proclaim a national Woody Guthrie Day.
   Mrs. Edgmon, a resident of Seminole about 75 miles southwest of
here, bristled at any suggestion her brother lacked patriotism,
saying he championed the downtrodden and jabbed the well-to-do.
   ``If you'd read what Woody wrote, you'd know how he felt,'' she
said.
   Guthrie's ``This Land is Your Land'' has become a patriotic
standard, frequently played at political rallies.
   His songs provided a mournful but optimistic rhythm for America
as it endured the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression.
   Among the 1,000 songs he wrote from 1932 to 1952 were classics
like ``Oklahoma Hills,'' and ``This Train is Bound for Glory.'' The
1976 motion picture ``Bound For Glory'' chronicled his vagabond life.
   Guthrie, stricken with the degenerative brain disease
Huntington's chorea, had indicated he wanted Okemah to be his final
resting place. The town 72 miles east of Oklahoma City, is a quiet
agricultural town surrounded by cattle-grazing land dotted with oil
wells.
   But when Guthrie died in 1967 at age 55, his ashes were scattered
over the Atlantic Ocean.
   The Okemah tribute was put together by musician Larry Long, 37,
of Minneapolis, who got a hug from Mrs. Edgmon after Thursday's
concert.
   ``He could double for Woody,'' she said, smiling and crying. ``It
took somebody to come in and put it together.''
   Some of the songs performed at the Crystal Theater were composed
by youngsters under Long's tutelage. The tunes were faithful to
Guthrie's credo, read by young narrator Jerry Baker: ``I'm out to
write songs that'll make you take pride in yourself.''
   Long said the performance, recorded both for an album and by a
crew from NBC's ``Today'' show, should help Guthrie's memory ``burn
a little brighter.''
   ``I've been to tributes from Carnegie Hall in New York to Beverly
Hills,'' Mrs. Edgmon said. ``None of them can top this. We're
instilling a positive Woody Guthrie in the minds of these little
ones. And they're going to be his fans.''

   Bride selling is still prevalent in poorer areas
of rural China and more must be done to stop the practice, according
to a women's organization quoted in today's official China Daily.
   The All-China Women's Federation said the selling of young women
as brides, common in pre-Communist China, still takes place in
inland provinces such as Anhui, Sichuan and Yunnan where economies
are less developed and education levels are lower, the China Daily
reported.
   It said some farmers have given up their land to go into the
business of abducting and selling brides. Some have lured women away
from villages with the promise of jobs.
   In one county of coastal Shandong province, more than 3,200
women, including farmers, factory workers and a post-graduate, have
been sold in the past few years, the federation was quoted as saying.
   It said a group of agents in a city in coastal Jiangsu province
made $65,000 selling about 100 brides from October 1987 to January
this year.
   The All-China Women's Federation is a government-supported
organization that to some extent acts as an advocate for women's
rights.

the Economist Intelligence Unit said in its annual report on food

   This year's drought in the United States, which reduced the

<HEAD>Study Says Calcium Intake, Sex Hormone Production Prevent
Osteoporosis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women can help prevent brittle bones in old age by
regularly consuming dairy products throughout their lives, but
calcium supplements taken after menopause probably won't be
effective, researchers say.
   In a study in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association, researchers said the key factors in bone density among
post-menopausal women were lifelong calcium intake and the naturally
occurring hormone estrone.
   Moderate exercise and calcium supplements taken later in life do
not appear to prevent osteoporosis, a frequently debilitating
disease most common among women in which the bones become thinner
and more brittle, they found.
   ``Swallowing calcium pills at 50 years of age probably is not
going to make your bones thicker,'' said Dr. Lewis Kuller, of the
Epidemiology Department at the University of Pittsburgh's School of
Public Health.
   Kuller, a co-author of the study involving 174 healthy
post-menopausal women over a four-year period, also said, ``There is
no evidence that moderate exercise in these women increased their
bone density.''
   ``The most important message ... is that an adequate calcium
intake during childhood, adolescence, post-adolescence and the
reproductive years is probably a very important part of good health
and will probably help prevent bone fracture and osteoporosis,'' he
said.
   Osteoporosis results in a loss of bone density and can lead to
bone fractures and spinal problems like dowager's hump. Some
estimates project that by age 70, one-quarter of the women in North
America will have suffered a fracture related to the disease.
   Kuller and his colleagues examined the relationship between bone
density and dietary calcium intake, calcium supplement use and blood
levels of estrone, the primary sex steroid hormone in women after
menopause. Estrone is a component of estrogen, a hormone combination.
   The study found that estrone was also a key factor in maintaining
bone density, a positive relationship that was not affected by
``age, time since menopause and the degree of obesity as well as
other potential bone determinants.''
   The researchers found that women who reported diets high in
calcium throughout their lives showed higher bone density. However,
observing little impact from use of calcium supplements after
menopause, the researchers concluded:
   ``In our analysis, the only group in which a protective effect of
calcium could be observed was in women who reported both a high milk
consumption during periods of growth and development, as well as
currently.''
   Kuller said the jury is still out on other methods of increasing
bone density and reducing fractures, but that estrogen therapy in
post-menopausal women ``probably reduces osteoporosis.''
   The study ``sounds like a reasonable observation supporting
what's either been partly known or widely suspected,'' Dr. Murray
Favus, director of the bone program at the University of Chicago's
Pritzker School of Medicine, said Thursday.
   Several recent studies have shown either no impact or minimal
impact of calcium supplements on bone density, and the role of
estrone has been shown to be important, he said.
   ``Most of those in the field now really question whether calcium
supplements taken after menopause are useful,'' Favus said.

   A single-engine plane crashed in the
mountains of the southern island of Mindanao, killing three
Americans and the Filipino pilot, the U.S. Embassy said today.
   The embassy identified the victims as Zaire Froats, 61, of Reno,
Nev., her daughter, Lea Froats, 34, and son Tad, no age available.
The pilot was identified as Manuel Cabal.
   An embassy official said Mrs. Froats and her son were visiting
the daughter, who was a medical missionary in Mindanao. Their
chartered Grumman aircraft took off from an airstrip in Malabang,
530 miles south of Manila, but crashed about 15 minutes later.
   The plane was en route to Iligan, about 50 miles north of
Malabang, officials said.
   Antonio Babijes, chief of the Rescue Coordination Center, said a
school principal in the municipality of Piagapo reported seeing the
plane crash in nearby mountains. A search team reached the site
later and confirmed the four deaths, he said.
   Babijes said he did not know if the bodies had been retrieved
because of poor communications in the area.
   No other details were immediately available.

   More news organizations have
protested a Defense Department demand that they surrender their film
of the launch of the space shuttle Atlantis in the event of an
accident.
   Some organizations removed their remote cameras from the area of
the launch pad, where the flight of the Atlantis was postponed
Thursday for at least 24 hours because of poor weather. Other news
organizations accepted the requirement, but under protest.
   After Air Force officers disclosed the new policy Wednesday, The
Associated Press, The New York Times and Newsweek magazine refused
to sign the agreement and were denied permission to place remote
cameras at the launch site. The AP described the arrangement as
``military censorship.''
   Later Wednesday, the Florida Times-Union withdrew its agreement
and its cameras. Gannett News Service did the same Thursday after
the launch was postponed.
   The remote cameras, focused on the base of the launch pad, are
1,500 to 2,500 feet away and are activated by the tremors and sounds
of liftoff. Photographers are kept about four miles from the launch
pad.
   The agreement gives the Defense Department the right to review
any film of an accident and to keep any it feels would disclose
classified information.
   Air Force Lt. Col. Ron Rand said the department needs to ensure
that no photos show the classified payload, which might be exposed
in an accident. Experts believe the payload to be a spy satellite.
   The Air Force agreement had not been required for other shuttle
missions with military payloads. Rand said it is linked to NASA's
signed agreement with news groups before the Discovery shuttle
launch Sept. 29, the first launch after the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion
of the Challenger.
   ``NASA had a written agreement, so we needed something in
writing,'' Rand said.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration agreement lets
news organizations process their own remote-camera film and give it
to investigators only after using what they need. NASA eventually
would return all film.
   ``We felt the agreement reached after the Challenger explosion
was sufficient. This one didn't sound definitive enough,'' said
Foster Marshall, Times-Union assistant managing editor for graphics.
   At least a dozen news organizations accepted the agreement.
Several said they would leave their cameras at the site while they
made formal protests and their lawyers studied the requirement.
   ``We will formally protest because it is an unreasonable and
silly attempt to impose censorship after the launch,'' said Sam
Terilli, general counsel for The Miami Herald.
   ``I thought it was a bad precedent,'' said Ron Cohen, executive
editor of Gannett News Service. ``...The demand that film be
confiscated was a clear case of a federal agency making an arbitrary
decision restricting First Amendment rights.''
   The Gannett cameras were put in place before the news service's
executives were aware of the new policy, and were removed at the
first opportunity, which was after Thursday's launch was scrubbed,
Cohen said.

   NASA knows it can't do anything about
the weather at its Florida launch site, but the space agency
probably wishes it didn't have to spend so much time talking about
it.
   Winds, clouds or storms have forced changes in liftoff plans for
the space shuttle eight times, including Thursday's postponement of
the Atlantis launch. Three times, Florida landings have been
canceled because of weather.
   Weather played a role in NASA's worst moment _ the explosion of
Challenger on Jan. 28, 1986, that claimed the lives of seven
astronauts.
   The Kennedy Space Center sits on a marshy island that is captive
to the shifting winds, frequent rain and powerful fronts moving in
from the north that keep the coastal weather in a turmoil of change.
   The capricious weather has only a minor effect on conventional
aircraft and mattered little in the early days of NASA, when
unmanned rockets could easily cut through clouds or strong winds on
their way into space.
   But the shuttle, which goes higher and faster, then returns to
Earth as a glider, is more sensitive to the forces of nature.
Launch-area winds as low as 20 miles an hour can keep the shuttle on
Earth. High-altitude winds, smashing into the shuttle as it races
upward, can be violent enough to destroy the spacecraft. It was the
threat of such winds that forced the postponement Thursday.
   Weather rules regulating the launch of the shuttle fill a thick
volume, and it takes a small army of forecasters and observers to
monitor the subtle atmospheric changes that can affect the spaceship.
   Some of the rules are new, created after sub-freezing
temperatures are thought to have contributed to the failure of a
solid-fuel rocket booster that caused the Challenger accident.
   Shuttle flights depend not only on the weather in Florida, but
also on conditions thousands of miles away. Since the spacecraft
could be forced to land on emergency runways in Europe, North Africa
or California, bad weather at those distant sites can force a launch
delay.
   Atlantis commander Robert L. Gibson twice suffered through a
weather delay in his first space command. His 1986 flight on
Columbia was postponed once because of poor weather in Moron, Spain,
an emergency landing site, and once because of heavy rains on the
launch pad.
   After he got in orbit, Gibson three times made plans to land in
Florida, and three times was disappointed. He finally ended his
Columbia flight with a touchdown on the desert lake bed at Edwards
Air Force Base in California, where weather is seldom a problem.
   NASA has decided for the immediate future to land all shuttles at
Edwards.

   A pathologist acquitted of charges he
killed his cancer-stricken wife to end her suffering says his first
job is putting his life back together, but he doesn't know where
he'll begin.
   ``I've got a lot of pieces. It's going to take a lot of work,''
Dr. Peter Rosier said Thursday after a jury cleared him of all
charges in the Jan. 15, 1986, death of his 43-year-old terminally
ill wife, Patricia.
   After deliberating a little more than three hours in the
four-week trial, the Pinellas County Surrogate Court panel cleared
Rosier, 47, of first-degree murder, attempted murder and conspiracy.
   As the verdict was read, Rosier wept and relatives in the
courtroom screamed with joy. If convicted, he could have been
sentenced to life in prison.
   Rosier hugged his children Jacob, 19, and Elizabeth, 21, who
supported him and attended the trial daily.
   The physician said his family wants him to resume his medical
practice, but he's doubtful about that. ``I've dealt with a lot of
cancer and death,'' he said.
   Assistant State Attorney Ed Volz said he was disappointed with
the verdict, but felt the prosecution handled the case well. ``The
jury made a decision based upon the facts,'' said Volz. ``I'm never
surprised by what a jury does.''
   Defense attorney Stanley Rosenblatt said the case never should
have gone to trial. For the state to charge first-degree murder
``bordered on insanity,'' Rosenblatt said.
   The state maintained that Rosier obtained sedatives for his wife
to commit suicide, then administered morphine when they only left
her comatose. Eventually, he manipulated her stepfather and brothers
into finishing the job, the state argued.
   But the defense portrayed Rosier as a loving husband of 22 years
who wanted to help his wife fulfill her wish of avoiding a painful
end.
   ``If anything good has come out of this, it is perhaps that
people in the U.S. will start to look at the terminally ill and the
rights of the terminally ill because of the terrible tragedy that
befell Patricia Rosier and the rest of our family,'' Rosier said.
   Derek Humphry, president of the pro-euthanasia Hemlock Society,
hailed the verdict and called for a change in laws to allow a
painless death to end suffering.
   The acquittal ``sends a signal ... that jurors are not likely to
convict in assisted suicide cases _ otherwise known as euthanasia.
It is time to modify the law to permit physicians to help terminal
patients who request help with death,'' he said.
   The prosecution charged that Rosier, pained by his wife's
fast-spreading lung cancer, obtained 20 Seconals for her to take and
administered morphine injections and suppositories when the sedative
failed to work.
   Her stepfather, Vincent Delman, testified that he went into her
bedroom with his two sons, Russell and Farrell, after she lingered
for 12 hours in a coma, and smothered her.
   The Delmans were key prosecution witnesses who testified under a
grant of immunity given before the state knew the extent of their
involvement.
   The charges were brought after Rosier appeared on a TV interview
and talked about administering drug overdoses to his wife.
   Volz said Rosier used the broadcast to try to spark interest in
an unpublished book about Mrs. Rosier's life and death, which he
wanted to parlay into a movie.

<HEAD>Five Die In Bomb Attack On Presidential Campaign Rally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEXTER CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sinhalese militants fired guns and
threw bombs at a presidential campaign rally, killing five people
and wounding 25, authorities said today.
   Eleven gunmen staged the attack during a rally Thursday night in
suburban Colombo for Ossie Abeygoonsekera, candidate of the United
Socialist Alliance, authorities said.
   The victims included one of Abeygoonsekera's bodyguards and
Devabandara Senaratne, vice president of the Sri Lanka People's
Party, one of four parties that form the alliance, officials said.
   It was the second attack in less than a month on a campaign rally
for Abeygoonsekera. On Nov. 17, suspected Sinhalese militants threw
bombs at another campaign meeting, killing three people and injuring
50.
   All three candidates in the Dec. 19 presidential election have
received death threats from the People's Liberation Front, a radical
Sinhalese group demanding the government's resignation.
   But Abeygoonsekera has been the only candidate to criticize the
front, which has been blamed for more than 900 political murders in
the past 16 months.
   According to police, six gunmen hijacked a passenger bus and
drove to the rally site in Kadawatte, about 10 miles north of the
capital. Five other gunmen were waiting among the spectators, police
said.
   ``While the extremists opened fire from the bus, the others at
the meeting flung five bombs,'' said one police official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   They escaped in the bus and another car, the official said.
   Sinhalese militants are upset at the government's efforts to end
the 5-year-old insurgency by minority Tamils fighting for a separate
homeland.
   They contend a peace accord signed in July 1987 grants too many
concessions to the Tamils, who make up 18 percent of the island's 16
million people.
   The Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the island's population and
control the government and the military.
   Sinhalese militants have been demanding the resignation of
President Junius R. Jayewardene's government.
   Jayewardene, a Sinhalese, is not seeking re-election and has said
he will step down and dissolve Parliament after his successor is
chosen.
   Besides Abeygoonsekera, the other candidates are Prime Minister
Ramasinghe Premadasa of the United National Party, and Sirimavo
Bandaranaike, former prime minister and leader of the Sri Lanka
Freedom Party.

   To punctuate or not to punctuate.
   That is the question about the 11-acre peninsula in this southern
Maine town owned by President-elect George Bush.
   The New York Times, Los Angeles Times and The Associated Press
spell Bush's summer estate, Walker's Point, with an apostrophe.
   USA Today and the local newspaper, the Journal Tribune, drop the
apostrophe, making it Walkers Point.
   A map by the Chamber of Commerce uses an apostrophe, but local
tax records do not.
   In his autobiography, ``Looking Forward,'' Bush spells the name
of the peninsula with an apostrophe.
   But the apostrophe may be wrong, said Don Orth, the executive
secretary of the U.S. Board on Geographic Names.
   In 1890, a group of professors and scholars ruled that most
proper names in place names are merely labels and do not require the
possessive apostrophe, Orth said.

   The postmark, which will be hand-stamped on mail deposited in a
mailbox in the visitor center across from Graceland, shows
snow-covered Christmas trees next to the tourist attraction mansion,
with the Graceland logo in an old English typeface below.
   The postmark says ``Graceland Christmas Station, Memphis, Tenn.,

   When Bob Miller takes over as governor
in January, he'll qualify for three titles: governor, acting
governor and lieutenant governor.
   ``Call me Bob,'' Miller said Thursday.
   Miller, currently the lieutenant governor, will replace Gov. Dick
Bryan, who was elected Nov. 8 to the U.S. Senate, when Bryan takes
his seat in Washington.
   Common usage and protocol will dictate that Miller be given the
title governor during the next two years.
   There's no reference to ``acting governor'' in the Nevada
Constitution. So Miller's title technically remains lieutenant
governor.
   State Archivist Guy Rocha said he spotted just one reference to
the term ``acting governor'' in state law, dealing with the salary
of lieutenant governor when acting as governor.

<HEAD>Man Wanted in New Mexico Slayings Held After Killing of Studio
Guard</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A fugitive mental patient suspected in a
deadly New Mexico shooting spree shot a Universal Studios guard to
death, then was critically wounded in a gunfight before screaming
``Help me! Kill me!'' to his captors.
   Nathan Nick Trupp, 42, the subject of a nationwide manhunt
following the slayings Tuesday of three people in an Albuquerque
shopping mall, shot one guard dead and critically wounded another
Thursday night before being wounded by Los Angeles County sheriff's
deputies, officials said.
   As he was strapped onto a stretcher, the bleeding Trupp could be
seen on television news reports screaming ``Help me! Kill me!''
   Trupp was in critical condition today after surgery for chest and
arm wounds at St. Joseph Medical Center in nearby Burbank, said a
hospital spokeswoman who refused to give her name.
   ``One of the charges he will face will probably be murder,'' said
Deputy Roger Hom. ``As soon as he is able, he will probably be moved
to the jail ward at County-USC Medical Center.''
   Hom identified the dead guard as Jeren Beeks, 27, of La
Crescenta. Guard Armando Torres, 20, was in critical condition at
St. Joseph with a head wound.
   Universal Studios, a 420-acre site 10 miles northwest of downtown
Los Angeles, houses an amusement park, movie and television studios
and offices.
   Trupp walked up to a guard shack at an employees' entrance to the
entertainment complex, and opened fire with a handgun, shooting both
guards in the head, said Deputy Van Mosley. Authorities did not know
what prompted the attack, Mosley said.
   Sheriff's deputies, aided by a third guard who was not hit,
spotted Trupp about a block away within minutes of the attack,
Mosley said.
   ``They engaged in a gunbattle,'' Mosley said.
   The Albuquerque Journal reported today that Trupp walked away
from the Trenton Psychiatric Hospital in New Jersey last year and
moved to Albuquerque.
   Trupp's older brother, Philip, a Washington, D.C., author, told
the Journal his brother has a lifelong history of mental problems
but no prior record of violence.
   ``This was a perfectly gentle person,'' Philip Trupp said in a
telephone interview Thursday, several hours before the shootings at
Universal Studios.
   Philip Trupp said his brother moved to New Mexico after leaving
the Trenton institution, which is New Jersey's main psychiatric
hospital.
   ``They gave him a furlough and he never came back,'' he said.
   Albuquerque authorities had been searching for Trupp as the
suspected gunman who complained of poisoned bagels, then killed
three people at a bagel shop in an Albuquerque mall.
   Slain were Richard Wilt, 39; his wife, Jeanne Wilt, 37, both of
Albuquerque, and the woman's father, Joseph Famiglietta Sr., 63, of
nearby Rio Rancho.
   Police raided Trupp's Albuquerque apartment Wednesday morning,
apparently minutes after he left town. They said they knew of no
motive for the mall shootings.
   Albuquerque police Sgt. Ruth Lowe said background checks of all
three victims and Trupp did not shed any light on the slayings. The
New Mexico Organized Crime Commission and the FBI were assisting in
the investigation.
   ``We can't find anywhere where he's been arrested,'' Lowe said.
   Neighbors in Albuquerque described Trupp as quiet.
   ``He wasn't an overly friendly guy,'' said Bob Ross. ``He didn't
work anywhere as far as I could tell. I never got the impression at
all for him to be violent.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study suggesting vitamins taken by women
helped prevent certain birth defects in their children needs further
scrutiny, doctors say.
   Medical researchers interviewed more than 3,000 mothers and found
that those who took vitamins about the time of conception were less
likely to have babies with brain and spine defects than other women.
   But the researchers are unsure whether to credit the vitamins or
some other factor, like diet.
   Evidence remains too thin to recommend that women planning
pregnancies take vitamins to try to ward off birth defects, said Dr.
Joseph Mulinare, who led the study group at the national Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta.
   ``Such a simple solution is almost too good to be true,'' said an
editorial accompanying the study in today's Journal of the American
Medical Association. ``We need confirmation of this finding from
other studies.''
   Still, the results are valuable because they are a starting point
for further research into vitamins as a guard against defects, like
anencephaly and spina bifida, Mulinare said Thursday.
   Anencephaly, the absence of major parts of the brain, usually is
fatal after a few hours. Spina bifida, the incomplete closing of the
bony casing around the spinal cord, typically causes mild to severe
paralysis of the lower body.
   The defects are equally common and strike about 3,500 infants
each year in the United States, Mulinare said.
   He and his colleagues looked at data on all babies born with at
least one of the defects in the five-county Atlanta area from 1968
through 1980.
   The researchers interviewed mothers of 347 babies born with the
defects, and 2,829 mothers of defect-free babies chosen randomly for
comparison.
   The mothers were asked if they had taken vitamins at least three
times a week during the three months before they became pregnant and
at least three months after conception.
   Fourteen percent of all the mothers reported taking multivitamins
or their equivalent during the entire six-month period, and 40
percent reported using no vitamins. The remainder of the mothers
either took vitamins only part of the time or couldn't recall, the
researchers said.
   ``We found that women who ... reported using multivitamins three
months prior to conception and in the first three months after
conception had a 50 to 60 percent reduction in risk of having a baby
with anencephaly or spina bifida, compared with women who reported
not having used any vitamins in that same time period,'' Mulinare
said.
   The researchers made adjustments for differences in the ages of
the mothers, their education levels, alcohol use, past unsuccessful
pregnancies, spermicide use, smoking habits and chronic illnesses.
All of those factors have been linked to differences in birth defect
rates in past research.
   The findings come five years after a British report found
multivitamin use by mothers who already had one baby with a birth
defect seemed to help prevent similar defects in children, the
researchers said.
   Dr. Lewis B. Holmes of Massachusetts General Hospital wrote in an
editorial accompanying the new study that genetic factors may cause
some kinds of spina bifida and that vitamins, even if effective,
would be unlikely to prevent all cases.

   A foot of snow blanketed northeast Ohio and almost as much fell
on western Pennsylvania early this morning, but the weather was mild
in the central and western parts of the nation.
   Snow was scattered from northeast Ohio into western Pennsylvania,
and across the eastern portions of Pennsylvania and New York state.
   In Ohio, 10 to 12 inches of snow covered northern Ashtabula
County and 9 to 12 inches were recorded in Lake County.
   In Pennsylvania, 6 inches of snow were measured in many parts of
Erie County, and up to 10 inches fell on Crawford County.
   In the Pacific Northwest, rain spread over the Washington coast
and extreme northwest Oregon ahead of a cold front anchored off the
Pacific.
   Today's forecast called for widespread rain through western
Washington and western Oregon; foggy conditions during the morning
over valleys of northern California and southwest Oregon; and widely
scattered snow through the eastern shores of the lower Great Lakes.
   Highs were forecast to be in the 20s in northern Maine; in the
30s through the Great Lakes, the central and northern Appalachians,
northern New England, northern Utah and much of Idaho; in the 60s
over central California and Arizona, northern Texas, Oklahoma, the
central Plains, western South Dakota, the lower Mississippi Valley,
the central Gulf Coast and the northern two-thirds of Florida; in
the 70s in southern Florida, southern Texas, southern California and
parts of the desert Southwest; and in the 40s and 50s elsewhere.
   Temperatures at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 7 degrees at Idaho Falls,
Idaho, to 67 degrees at Key West, Fla.

   West Germans today marked the 50th anniversary of
the discovery of nuclear fission with mixed emotions, recalling the
breakthrough that led to atomic bombings of Japan and the Chernobyl
nuclear disaster.
   The main ceremony was held in West Berlin's Congress Hall, just a
few miles from the laboratory where German scientists Otto Hahn and
Fritz Strassmann conducted their pioneering scientific work in
December 1938.
   Words of homage were paid their work, but speakers also
emphasized the troubling consequences of the discovery that
splitting the uranium atom can lead to the release of massive
amounts of energy.
   ``The bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, more than anything else,
have taken away any kind of relaxed attitude toward nuclear fission
in today's thinking,'' said Heinz A. Staab, president of the
Max-Planck scientific research institute.
   U.S. atomic bombs dropped Aug. 6, 1945, on Hiroshima and three
days later on Nagasaki killed about 210,000 people and led to
Japan's surrender to end World War II.
   Staab told about 1,100 guests, ``The euphoria of the 1950s for a
peaceful use of nuclear fission for producing energy has given way
to a skeptical judgment since Chernobyl.''
   The 1986 Chernobyl accident that killed 31 people in the Soviet
Union sent clouds of radioactivity over Western Europe.
   Resistance to nuclear energy remains especially strong among
young West Germans, who oppose the stationing of nuclear rockets on
their soil.
   West Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen said, ``This discovery changed
the world like hardly any other one before it.''
   ``Today we recall this great scientific deed, without being able
to celebrate,'' Diepgen said. He said honor for the achievement must
include a recollection of the consequences ``from Hiroshima to
Chernobyl.''
   The prestigious Max-Planck Institute, along with four other
scientific research organizations, sponsored the ceremony. It was
held two weeks before the actual 50th anniversary of the key
experiment, which started Dec. 16, 1938.
   Hahn received the 1944 Nobel Prize in chemistry for the discovery
at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry in Berlin.
   Hahn and Strassmann found that bombarding the uranium atom with
neutrons leads to its splitting, but at first they didn't understand
the full implications of their work.
   Then from her exile in Sweden, their Jewish colleague, Lise
Meitner, furnished the theoretical basis showing that such a
splitting could release huge amounts of energy through chain
reactions based on Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. Her
partner, Otto Robert Frisch, also contributed to the theoretical
work.
   Miss Meitner had been driven into exile by the Nazis several
months before the discovery.
   The Nazi era cast a shadow over another part of the work.
   Albert Speer, a former top aide to Adolf Hitler, strongly implied
that Hahn was one of a group of German scientists seeking ways to
build an atomic bomb before the Americans beat them to it.
   Speer, Hitler's armaments minister and the Third Reich's top
architect, wrote that in 1942 he had heard of ``a group of
scientists who were on the track of a weapon which could annihilate
whole cities, perhaps throw the island of England out of the fight.''
   He wrote that two months later he visited with scientists in
Berlin to be briefed on ``atomic research,'' as the Nazi Reich
struggled to find a way to win World War II.
   ``Along with scientists whose names I no longer recall, the
subsequent Nobel Prize winners'' including Hahn were present, Speer
wrote in his memoirs, ``Inside the Third Reich.''
   However, West Berlin's Tagesspiegel newspaper last week said Hahn
wrote in his diary of having a clean conscience ``that neither
during the discovery nor later did I want to work for the use of
uranium fission as a war weapon.''
   The newspaper said Hahn wrote the passage shortly after the
United States dropped the bomb on Hiroshima. At the time, Hahn and
other top German atomic scientists were being detained in a British
camp, according to Tagesspiegel.
   On Thursday, scientists and officials of the Technical University
in West Berlin held a news conference to review the discovery and to
outline the opening today of their documentary exhibit.
   ``The development of nuclear physics and its technology has found
interest among the public like no other discovery,'' university vice
president Ulrich Steinmueller said.
   Steinmueller continued: ``The technology carries implicitly in
its use _ both in war and peace _ a threat for mankind. The
well-founded worries and fears of people give scientists a challenge
to be aware of their responsibilities to society.''

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Newspaper Returns After Four-Week Suspension</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: SUBS 3rd graf, `Information Minister...' to correct title.

<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Weekly Mail, a prominent
anti-apartheid newspaper, returned to newsstands today after a
four-week suspension by the government.
   ``We're back,'' the newspaper declared on its front page. ``We're
still strong. And we're ready to carry on fighting.''
   Home Affairs Minister Stoffel Botha suspended the Weekly Mail
Nov. 1, saying the publication was a ``threat to the safety of the
public.'' Botha has shut down three anti-government newspapers this
year, but all resumed publishing after suspensions ranging from four
to 12 weeks.
   The Weekly Mail, with a circulation of about 22,000 nationwide,
is aimed largely at liberal whites and is considered by many to be
South Africa's best-written newspaper.
   Since it was established in 1985, the newspaper has been a
combative government opponent, known for aggressive reporting and
sassy political commentary.
   ``The Weekly Mail may have offended Stoffel Botha, but it did not
break any law,'' the newspaper said in a front-page editorial. ``Our
`crime' was to criticize the government and raise questions about
its policies and behavior. We will continue to do this.''
   Botha could again suspend the newspaper for up to three months.
   ``We can't deny that the month's suspension has hurt,'' the
newspaper said, noting the loss of advertising and sales revenue.
   ``But the extraordinary level of support we have received makes
us confident about our future,'' it added.
   The edition contained several advertisements purchased by its
corporate and political supporters welcoming its return.
   The Weekly Mail has said that Botha's complaints focused on the
newspaper's coverage of security force actions and reports about
banned organizations such as the African National Congress guerrilla
movement.
   Today's edition contained an article on blacks who have died
while in police custody and a story about recently released prisoner
Harry Gwala, a long-time ANC member.
   Other stories focused on whites who have refused to perform
compulsory military service and on a black man who was on trial for
3{ years before being acquitted of treason charges.
   Botha's powers to suspend newspapers are part of the numerous
media restrictions imposed under the country's 29-month-old state of
emergency. The regulations restrict reporting on security force
actions, many forms of peaceful protest and a wide range of
statements the government considers subversive.
   In another development, the government ordered the anti-apartheid
Afrikaans-language newspaper Vrye Weekblad to pay a $13,000 deposit
for a registration certificate.
   If the newspaper does not pay, the government could shut it down.
The government has not said why it is seeking the amount, believed
to be the largest security deposit ever demanded in South Africa.
There is no fixed amount required for a registration certificate,
and some publications have paid less than $45.
   The government already has complained about articles in the
weekly newspaper, which has been publishing for only a few weeks.
   Under apartheid, the nation's 26 million black majority has no
voice in national affairs.

<HEAD>Bronx Congressman, Wife Plead Innocent to Wedtech Charges</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   For the second time in two years, a Bronx
congressman is proclaiming his innocence in the Wedtech corruption
scandal.
   U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia and his wife, Jane Lee Garcia, pleaded
innocent Thursday to charges they participated in a bribery and
extortion scheme involving Wedtech Corp., a defunct defense
contractor.
   ``I'm innocent and when the moment comes I'll be exonerated,''
Garcia told reporters as the couple entered the courthouse.
   Following their arraignment before a federal magistrate, the
55-year-old Bronx Democrat and his 48-year-old wife were released
without bail.
   U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand set a tentative trial date of
June 1, and scheduled a preliminary hearing for Jan. 3.
   The Garcias and a lawyer from Puerto Rico, Ralph Vallone Jr., 41,
were indicted last week in an alleged conspiracy to obtain $185,000
in cash, interest-free loans and jewelry from Wedtech.
   The indictment came just a few days after former U.S. Rep. Mario
Biaggi, another Bronx Democrat, and four others were sentenced to
prison for their conviction in a Wedtech-related racketeering trial.
   Wedtech grew from a small machine shop into a multimillion-dollar
business through a series of no-bid government contracts obtained
through a federal minority business program.
   Federal and state investigations uncovered a web of corruption
involving Wedtech payoffs extending from the Bronx to Washington.
   The seven-count indictment accused Garcia of using his official
position to demand and obtain payoffs from Wedtech, which was
headquartered in his congressional district.
   Garcia, a congressman since 1978, is charged with extortion,
conspiracy, bribery and receipt of illegal gratuities. His wife, 48,
faces similar charges.

<HEAD>TV Viewing Up Overall, But Network Share Declines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Television viewing rose slightly during November,
but the networks' share of viewership declined as independent
stations' and pay cable's share increased compared with the same
period a year ago.
   Independent stations, which have become more aggressive about
programming during sweeps periods, racked up a 47 percent increase
in ratings for November, compared to the same period last year,
according to the A.C. Nielsen Co. Pay cable was up 33 percent.
   The networks rebounded a bit during the month, thanks to ABC's
miniseries ``War and Remembrance.''
   Overall network viewing had been off 6 percent so far this
season. In November it was off about 3 percent. ABC, which came in
third last season, saw its viewing rise 10 percent.
   ``Look for January to be critical for the networks in terms of
re-establishing series viewing patterns,'' said David Poltrack, CBS
vice president for marketing.
   He predicted that in the January sweeps, without stiff
competition from independent stations and cable, and with the full
schedule of strike-delayed 1988-89 network shows finally on the air,
the networks might have a chance to get back some of their audience.
   NBC, with five of the top 10 series and the five top-rated
movies, won the sweeps _ one of four months a year when network
affiliates' ratings are measured for purposes of negotiating local
advertising rates.
   NBC had an average, prime-time rating of 15.4, ABC 14.0 and CBS
12.0. Each rating point represents 904,000 households with
televisions.
   NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' was the highest-rated network show with
a rating of 26.3, down from the 32.3 the show got in November 1987.
In fact, all of the top-rated series' ratings declined.
   Poltrack said the four-month writers' strike last summer hurt CBS
the most, leaving it without some new series and fewer movies to
fill in the gaps.
   Because of strike-caused production delays on its regular series,
ABC rushed to the air with the first 18 hours of its more than
30-hour ``War and Remembrance'' sequel to ``The Winds of War.''
   It ended with a disappointing 18.6 rating but helped save ABC
from third place in the sweeps. ABC will run the remainder of the
miniseries in May, said spokeswoman Janice Gretemeyer.
   Fox Broadcasting Co., whose affiliates are counted as independent
stations, experienced a rise in ratings, 5.5 compared with 3.7 a
year ago. Fox had new episodes of its most popular programs,
``America's Most Wanted'' and ``Married ... With Children,'' when
the networks were in repeats.
   Independent stations also did well by taking over what was
previously a network source of programming _ threatrical release
movies.
   The networks have all but abandoned them as a source of ratings,
said Poltrack. Meanwhile, independent stations are garnering
competitive ratings by running such films as ``48 Hours'' and ``The
Godfather.''
   HBO's rating was 8.3 compared to 6.9 a year ago. That was the
first increase for HBO in the five years since the networks began
analyzing pay cable performance during sweeps.

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Figure Killed in Plane Crash</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MORELIA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Israeli counterterrorism expert who
briefed Vice President George Bush on secret arms sales to Iran died
in a plane crash in a remote area of Mexico while traveling under an
assumed name, officials said.
   The Cessna T210 crashed Wednesday at a ranch 110 miles west of
Mexico City, killing the Israeli, Amiram Nir, 37, and the pilot.
Three other passengers were badly injured, including Adriana
Stanton, 25, of Canada.
   Nir was traveling under the name Pat Weber, Isauro Gutierrez
Fernandez, a spokesman for the Michoacan state attorney general,
said Thursday.
   Israel's ambassador to Mexico, Dov Schmorak, said in an interview
broadcast today on Israel's armed forces radio that he did not know
why Nir was in Mexico or why he used that name.
   Gutierrez said engine failure was the probable cause of the crash.
   But Schmorak told the radio that Mexican authorities said
preliminary information that suggested the crash was caused by a
violent rain storm.
   A Foreign Ministry official in Jerusalem who spoke on condition
of anonymity told the radio Nir was on private business.
   Nir, a former adviser on counterterrorism to two Israeli prime
ministers, was an important liaison in secret arms deals involving
the sale of U.S. weapons to Iran, according to testimony given to
U.S. congressional investigators.
   Former White House aide Oliver North, who was deeply involved in
the U.S.-Iranian arms transactions, suggested during congressional
testimony that the Contra link _ diverting funds from U.S. arms
sales to Iran to Nicaraguan rebels _ was Nir's idea. Israel denied
it.
   Nir was sought for questioning by Special U.S. Prosecutor
Lawrence E. Walsh. Israel insisted Nir be granted immunity from
prosecution.
   Schmorak told the radio Nir apparently missed a regularly
scheduled flight and hired a private plane.
   Gutierrez said Nir arrived Sunday in Mexico City and traveled to
Uruapan, 190 miles west, to stay with friends.
   ``It appears he had some possible business involving shipments of
products from Latin America to Europe,'' Gutierrez said. He refused
to elaborate.
   A state attorney general's statement identified the dead pilot as
Pedro Espinoza Hurtado, 34, and the others injured as Guillermo
Joaonde Amezqua, 35, and Ester Areaga, 23.
   An airport official in Uruapan said the Cessna was bound for
Mexico City.
   The plane, belonging to Aerotaxis of Uruapan, took off Wednesday
afternoon from Uruapan and crashed 30 minutes later near Ciudad
Hidalgo, the statement said.
   Nir was a close associate of Shimon Peres, now foreign minister
of Israel. Peres, prime minister from 1984-86, appointed Nir adviser
on counterterrorism in 1985 and assigned him to serve as liaison
with North.
   In January 1986, Nir met in Washington with North and Adm. John
Poindexter, the National Security adviser, and proposed to renew
arms shipments to Iran.
   Nir also met with North in Israel and Europe, discussing U.S.
arms sales to Iran through Israel and the diversion of profits to
the Contras, despite a congressional ban on military aid to the
rebels.
   Nir also traveled to Tehran, Iran, in May 1986 with North and
former National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane to discuss the
release of American hostages held by pro-Iranian extremists in
Lebanon in return for the supply of anti-aircraft Hawk missiles.
   Nir briefed Bush on the program involving U.S. weapons sales to
Iran in Jerusalem on July 27, 1986. Bush has said he does not
remember much about the briefing, but his aide Craig Fuller attended
the meeting and took notes.
   Nir, a former journalist, remained on after Yitzhak Shamir
succeeded Peres as prime minister in October 1986, and the
Iran-Contra affair exploded that November. He resigned this year.
   Israeli leaders admitted selling weapons to Iran but only in
cooperation with the United States. Israel also denied any knowledge
of the Contra connection.

   NATO defense ministers tackled the
potentially divisive issue of how to fairly share the cost of
maintaining the alliance, officials said today at the conclusion to
a two-day meeting.
   The defense ministers agreed ``there are significant variations
in the scale and nature of their contributions,'' but the final
communique said Europe and the United States remained steadfast
partners.
   ``Once and for all it is clear this is not a matter of the United
States versus the rest of the alliance, this is a joint alliance
effort,'' NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner said.
   However, U.S. Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci stressed the
report showed ``nations are not bearing a fair share of the common
defense burden,'' an issue that caused U.S. congressional critics to
raise the prospect of withdrawing some of the 326,000 U.S. troops
stationed in Europe.
   Carlucci said it was now NATO's task to create an ``effective
follow-up in a manner that serves to strengthen the cohesion of the
alliance and allied defense capabilities.''
   Woerner said the meeting achieved that. ``We did not only deliver
words but deeds,'' Woerner said. ``We did not only speak of
improving our defense effort and burden sharing but we took
decisions.''
   The ministers approved additional funds for transferring U.S.
F-16 fighter jets from Spain to Italy and cleared the way for a
study on a multinational European military unit in northern Central
Europe.
   A 79-page report approved Thursday has already produced a number
of specific commitments by members to improve their contributions,
Britain's secretary of state for defense, George Younger, said.
   The report asked Belgium, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, West
Germany, Canada, Portugal and Spain to make bigger budget
contributions.
   ``The differences between some individual national contributions
are glaring,'' said the report, which urged most European allies to
boost defense spending, upgrade military equipment and become more
active partners.
   The report offered a response to U.S. critics who claim Europe is
not doing enough to maintain NATO's strength, officials said.
   Guy Coeme, defense minister for Belgium, warned the report should
``not be used for mutual reproaches'' but to boost the ``collective
effort'' for common defense.
   The report went beyond analyzing the financial cost to highlight
the social cost of the European allies who provide facilities,
territory and troops to maintain a credible defense in Europe.
   Many European nations proposed additional efforts, officials
said, including a plan to introduce a multinational European
military unit in northern Central Europe.
   The project is only in the initial stage of study but Younger
urged NATO as a whole should profit from the intitiative.
   The report estimated the United States spent an average 5.98
percent of its economic output on defense from 1983 to 1987. Tops
was Greece, which spent 6.52 percent.
   Britain devoted 5.01 percent of its gross domestic product to
defense; Turkey 4 percent, and Germany 3.2 percent.
   Others were: Belgium, 3.26 percent; Canada, 2.17 percent;
Denmark, 2.2 percent; Italy, 2.16 percent; Luxembourg, 1.18 percent;
Netherlands, 3.32 percent; Norway, 2.93 percent; Portugal, 3.22
percent; and Spain, 2.37 percent. Iceland was not included in the
table.

   Armed men commandeered a bus loaded with
schoolchildren and teachers and demanded a plane to leave the
country, an official said today.
   All the hostages are safe, and the hijackers were in control of a
plane that was provided for them, Albert Vlasov, head of the Soviet
news agency Novosti, said at a news conference.
   He spoke after airport officials in Israel and Cyprus said the
plane had left for Tel Aviv. But Vlasov would not say whether the
plane had taken off.
   He did not say who the hijackers were, or say how many there
were, but added that they wanted to go to Israel, South Africa or
Pakistan.
   ``A group of armed bandits hijacked a bus with 30 school children
and a teacher and demanded a plane to deliver them abroad,'' Vlasov
said.
   He said the incident began Thursday in the city of Ordzhonikidze
in southern Russia, just north of the Georigian republic.
   ``In order to save the children and the teacher a decision was
made to give a plane,'' Vlasov said. He said all the hostages were
now safe.
   ``The terrorists have the plane now,'' he said.

   The arrests of seven people suspected of
manufacturing and distributing the synthetic drug ``China white,''
which has been linked to 13 deaths, has shut down one supplier of
the drug, police said.
   Authorities suspect as many as 60 people overdosed on the
``designer drug'' methylfentanyl, which was sold by itself or mixed
with heroin or cocaine, Allegheny County Coroner Joshua Perper said.
The drug also is suspected in seven other deaths, he said.
   The drug produces a euphoria similar to that of heroin but is
hundreds of times more powerful. The small quantities needed to be
effective makes it more difficult to detect.
   Police informants say the drug has disappeared from the street in
the last 10 days, Assistant Police Chief Chester Howard said.
   The arrests shut down one Pittsburgh source of the drug, but
there may be other sources, Police Chief Ralph Pampena said.
   Tom Schaefers, 48, a professional chemist, was arrested Thursday
night at his home in suburban Aspinwall, police said. Officers
confiscated eqiupment from a basement laboratory in the house, where
Schaefers lived with his elderly parents.
   ``We feel he's the one who put it together,'' said Detective
Barry Fox. ``All of our evidence points to that.''
   Arrested earlier Thursday in raids on five Pittsburgh-area homes
were Donald Sunkin, 39, of Springdale; Donald Hurley, 31, of
Bellevue; John Hricak, 42, of Bellevue; Richard Williams, 33, of
Harmarville; Mary Kathryn McNally, 38, of New Kensington,
Westmoreland County; and Brenda Ragland Smith, 40, of Bellevue.
   They were arraigned before U.S. Magistrate Robert C. Mitchell,
who ordered them held at Allegheny County Jail pending the bond
hearings today.
   All six were charged with conspiracy to manufacture and
distribute the drug. Smith, Sunkin, Williams and McNally also were
charged with distribution and with contributing to the death of Jay
Duschl, 38, of Verona, who died June 2 after taking the drug.

<TEXT>
   Prominent anti-apartheid
activist and journalist Zwelakhe Sisulu, who has been detained
without charge for two years, was released today and placed under
tight restrictions.
   Sisulu, editor of the New Nation newspaper, will not be allowed
to work on the publication, cannot give interviews or be in the
presence of more than 10 people and must remain in the Johannesburg
area, his lawyer Priscilla Jana said. ``The restrictions are very,
very heavy,'' Ms. Jana said as she ushered Sisulu from Diepkloof
Prison in the Soweto township outside Johannesburg.
   Lt. Peet Bothma of the Law and Order Ministry said several other
detainees also would be released today, but he did not say how many
or who they were. A source who demanded anonymity said Eric Molobi,
an official with the National Education Crisis Committee, also was
to be freed.
   Sisulu, 37, has been held without charge since December 1986
under state of emergency regulations.
   His parents also are among the country's best-known activists.
Sisulu's father is jailed African National Congress leader Walter
Sisulu, a close colleague of ANC leader Nelson Mandela.
   Sisulu's mother, Albertina, is a co-president of the United
Democratic Front, a banned anti-apartheid coalition. Mrs. Sisulu,
who works as a nurse in the Soweto township, is under government
restrictions that prevent her from being quoted. She has been
detained several times and was under banning orders from 1964-81.
   The decision to release Sisulu and other detainees is the latest
in a series of government actions that appears aimed at reducing
domestic and international pressure on South Africa.
   In the past 10 days, the goverment has:
   _Released two aging and ailing activists, Harry Gwala, 69, a
long-time ANC member, and Zeph Mothopeng, 75, president of the Pan
Africanist Congresss, another outlawed anti-apartheid group.
   _Announced that Mandela, the country's best known black leader,
will not return to prison when he completes his recuperation from
tuberculosis at a Cape Town hospital. However, the government has
said Mandela will remain in custody.
   _Granted clemency to the ``Sharpeville Six,'' a group of blacks
convicted of complicity in a 1984 mob killing. Their death
sentences, replaced with lengthy jail terms, had touched off an
international protest campaign.
   Sisulu, who worked for several newspapers before joining New
Nation, was detained for eight months in 1981-2.
   In both 1979 and 1982 he was sentenced to prison for refusing to
testify at trials involving activists. But both convictions were set
aside on appeal. He was a Niemann Fellow at Harvard University in
1984-5.
   He was named editor of New Nation in 1986, but was detained in
June. He was released several months later, but was again detained
in December.
   The New Nation newspaper, which is published by the Southern
Africa Catholic Bishops' Conference, was suspended for three months
by the government earlier this year but has resumed publishing.

   Federal agents ended the Mafia's days of
wine and roses, busting up a drug ring in the United States and
Italy that smuggled heroin into this country in wine bottles and
shipments of flowers.
   The sting operation, which began in a small suburban Buffalo
storefront, shut down a massive American and Sicilian Mafia
narcotics operation that was selling millions of dollars worth of
heroin in the United States and cocaine in Italy, the FBI and
federal prosecutors said Thursday.
   As a result of the three-year investigation, which broadened to
include FBI offices nationwide, the FBI and Italian authorities have
charged more than 200 people, including Sicilian Mafia figures and
associates of the Gambino crime family in New York. A total of 68
people were charged in the United States and 133 in Italy.
   Some of the heroin smuggled into the United States was liquified
and put into bottles purported to be Sicilian wine, without the
knowledge of the vintner. The bottles were brought from Italy by
female couriers who strapped the drugs to their bodies, officials
said.
   ``It actually looked like wine in the wine bottle,'' said James
Fox, assistant director of the FBI's New York office.
   Heroin also arrived in shipments of roses, among other
subterfuges, authorities said.
   Although the international food trading company set up in Buffalo
by agents never handled any drug shipments, it allowed the FBI to
establish contacts with organized crime operations in the United
States and Italy, G. Robert Langford, special agent in charge of the
FBI's Buffalo office, said Thursday.
   Agents traveled to Italy and posed as buyers who discussed making
major drug purchases, the FBI said.
   Substantial amounts of imported heroin were sold to the Gambino
Mafia family in New York, which allegedly arranged for nationwide
distribution, according to a complaint filed in the case in
Philadelphia. Some of the heroin was passed to buyers in U.S. pizza
parlors. Other drugs were concealed in wine shipments.
   One of those arrested in the police roundup was Giuseppe Gambino,
a nephew of Carlo Gambino, the late reputed head of the Gambino
crime family.
   A complaint filed in Manhattan against 28 people alleged that the
organization ``obtained cocaine in the U.S., transported the cocaine
over to Italy, exchanged the cocaine for heroin, so the cocaine was
sold in Italy, and the heroin was sold in the U.S.,'' U.S. Attorney
Rudolph Giuliani said.
   ``They found the best market for their product,'' the U.S.
attorney added.
   ``This is the largest example so far of the Mafia's involvement
in cocaine, which is something that was unheard of a few years
ago,'' Giuliani said.
   ``They were selling kilos of heroin for approximately $200,000 a
kilo; they were trading in multi-kilo quantities,'' said Fox.
``There were millions and millions of dollars.''
   What had started as an independent FBI probe of drug trafficking
in Philadelphia, code-named ``Iron Tower,'' was coordinated with the
Buffalo probe when some names of suspected traffickers turned up in
both, said the FBI. The Philadelphia probe was named after a town in
Sicily called Torretta, the FBI said. One of those being sought in
the case in the United States, Tommaso Scalici, is an Italian
citizen from Torretta, said an FBI spokesman in New Jersey, James
Knights. Scalici is charged with conspiracy to distribute heroin.
   The operation in Buffalo began when agents learned from an
informer in a 1983 drug bust that organized crime families in Sicily
wanted to set up an import-export company as a front for drug
operations.
   Buffalo was chosen because of its proximity to the Canadian
border, Knights said, adding that the Peace Bridge connecting
Buffalo and Fort Erie, Ontario, was an entry point for earlier drug
shipments from Italy to the United States.
   Undercover agents began working on the case, dubbed BUSICO _ an
acronym for the Buffalo-Sicilian Connection, in 1985.
   With the cooperation of the U.S. Customs office in Buffalo, the
FBI rented a storefront in a shopping plaza in the Buffalo suburb of
Hamburg and set up the company called BSC Wholesale Inc.
   The export-import business, which did buy and sell tomato paste
and olive oil, never materialized as a major drug distribution point.
   But at the same time, the Buffalo agents began making purchases
of heroin, cocaine and other drugs from various drug dealers who
claimed to have international connections. Most of the deals took
place in other cities and gradually came to involve FBI offices
throughout the country, Langford said.
   U.S. Attorney Dennis Vacco called the operation ``a classic
sting.''
   Arrests were made in Baltimore; Buffalo, N.Y.; Miami; Newark,
N.J.; New York; Philadelphia; San Francisco; and Rockford, Ill. In
Italy, arrests were being made in Palermo, Bologna and Florence.

   The ``Talking Silver Rail Express'' toy train
is being recalled because of a potential fire hazard, according to
the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
   The importer, New Bright Industries of Canton, Mich., had
received 16 reports of the toys short circuiting and causing the
tender car to overheat, with nine cases in which the train caught
fire, the agency said. No injuries have been reported.
   Involved in the recall are about 38,000 of the toy trains with
metal plug connectors between the tender car and the locomotive
section. They were manufactured in Hong Kong in 1986 and were
identified as Model 1170.
   Newer train sets carrying that model number, but having a plastic
plug connector between the two cars, are not involved in the recall,
the commission said.
   Owners of the recalled train sets can obtain a free replacement
by calling New Bright Industries at 1-800-325-5630. Michigan
residents should call collect at 1-313-981-0020. Consumers can also
write to New Bright Industries, 41911 Ford Road, Canton, Mich.,
48187.
   Those needing more information can contact the commission at
1-800-638-2772.

   A woman who claims to be a North Korean
agent said today she hates North Korean leaders for ordering her to
blow up a South Korean jetliner last year with 115 people aboard,
news reports said.
   Kim Hyon-hui, 26, made the comment when government prosecutors
questioned her behind closed doors to determine her role in the
destruction of a Korean Air (KAL) Boeing 707 that disappeared near
Burma Nov. 29, 1987.
   She has said she planted a bomb aboard the plane.
   Hundreds of students demanding a parliamentary probe into Miss
Kim's case battled riot police today at Seoul's Yonsei University.
Students hurled firebombs and rocks at riot police, who retaliated
with tear gas grenades, but there were no immediate reports of
injuries in the one-hour clash.
   Government prosecutors, who must determine whether to file formal
charges against Miss Kim, said she admitted most allegations against
her and aplogized for what she had done. They declined to elaborate
on their interrogation.
   Local newspapers said Miss Kim's voice cracked when she told
prosecutors she had killed many people and must be be punished.
   Miss Kim strongly denounced North Korea President Kim Il Sung and
his son and heir apparent Kim Jong Il, according to Yonhap, the
South Korean news agency. ``Now, I hate them most,'' she was quoted
as saying.
   It was Miss Kim's first public appearance since Jan. 15, when she
confessed in a televised news conference to being trained and
ordered by North Korean leaders to bomb the plane to disrupt this
year's Olympic Games in Seoul.
   North Korea and South Korea have been bitter rivals since their
land was divided in 1945. The North wanted to be a co-host of the
Olympics.
   Miss Kim has been in custody of the Agency for National Security
Planning, the main South Korean intelligence organization, since she
was extradited from Bahrain to Seoul last year.
   Tight security was in force hours before she arrived at the Seoul
District Prosecutor's office. Hundreds of plainclothes police were
posted on the streets and atop nearby buildings.
   Miss Kim arrived in a sedan, accompanied by two intelligence
officers. Unlike most suspects, she was not wearing handcuffs.
   Yonhap, quoting unidentified prosecution sources, said the day's
questioning also centered on Miss Kim's family and educational
background in North Korea.
   Miss Kim and a male companion, traveling on forged Japanese
passports, were among passengers aboard the KAL flight from Baghdad,
Iraq to Seoul. The couple, posing as father and daughter, left the
plane during a stopover in Abu Dhabi.
   They took poison when police tried to question them at Bahrain
Airport. The man died.
   Under South Korean law, Miss Kim's appearance before the
prosecution was to determine whether formal charges should be filed
against her. If formal charges are filed, she will be put on trial.
   Miss Kim, if found guilty, could be sentenced to death under
South Korea's Criminal Code and national security and aviation laws.

<HEAD>DOE Prepares Formal Criteria For Restart Of SRP Nuclear Reactors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Department of Energy officials have set
guidelines for restarting the nuclear reactors that are the nation's
source of tritium for nuclear warheads.
   The guidelines, which include calls for unannounced inspections
and setting training and safety standards consistent with those in
place for commercial nuclear reactors, clear the way for a restart
of the three Savannah River Plant reactors _ the only ones now
capable of supplying the nation's stockpile of tritium.
   Due to problems encountered during an August restart of
P-Reactor, DOE officials have kept the reactors off line until the
guidelines for reactor restarts could be written. The reactors
remain shut down for maintenance and safety upgrades.
   On Tuesday, DOE Secretary John Herrington said the department
hopes to restart K-Reactor at the Aiken, S.C., plant by late spring
or early summer.
   Details on the new guidelines, which have not been made public,
were obtained by the Morris News Service's Washington bureau,
according to a story published in the Augusta-based Morris
Communications Corp. newspapers.
   The news service quoted unidentified sources in the Department of
Energy as saying the restart of the K-Reactor and other reactors
will be keyed to implementation of the specific goals outlined in
the report.
   Deadlines for complying with the goals set out in the report will
be established in a few weeks, the news service said.
   The report calls for improvements in plant systems and components
to assure that the reactors can operate as designed within pre-set
margins of safety.
   Among its specific guidelines, the report calls for the addition
of a fifth work shift per reactor, hiring shift supervisors with
four-year science or technical degrees, adding of an engineer
certified by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to each shift,
offering more advanced training for reactor operators and setting
training standards that are consistent with the commercial nuclear
industry.
   Another area of the report calls for standard maintenance and
testing procedures, new safety analysis criteria and revised
procedures for reporting unusual reactor incidents to DOE officials.
   The report also calls for improved on-site technical vigilance
and monitoring, including increased use of on-site engineers backed
by outside experts and consultants; implementation of more technical
training programs; and requirements that reports be channeled to
Washington.
   Administration and congressional sources have said the nation's
stockpiles of tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen used to
boost the yield of nuclear weapons, will be depleted badly within
six months to two years.

   A nursing homes representative said today a
75-volume federal consumers guide that reports poor sanitary
conditions and other problems at many of the nation's nursing homes
will confuse people looking for the best facility.
   The designer of the study, which seeks to make available the
results of thousands of spot inspections, said the report gives
valuable information but should not replace personal inspection by
patients or relatives considering a home.
   The guide shows how each of the nation's 15,000 nursing homes
fared in inspections conducted within the last 18 months, allowing
anyone looking for a home to make comparisions within their
communities.
   An overview showed 43 percent had substandard santitation in food
services and 30 percent failed to administer drugs properly or to
ensure basic hygiene for patients. The seriousness of violations was
not indicated.
   Overall, the failure rate exceeded 15 percent in 10 of 32
categories chosen for inclusion in the report, but about 2,400
nursing homes received passing marks in all 32.
   ``We can't tell from the study what is trivial and what is
important,'' said Paul Willging, executive vice president of the
9,000-member American Health Care Association, the major nursing
home trade group. ``The incompleteness of the data is going to
conuse the American consumer.''
   Willging, in an interview on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show, noted that
the report does not include serious violations, which he said are
usually found in regular inspections and ordered corrected at the
time they are found.
   By focusing on sometimes-trivial violations, it fails to give
more important information about whether homes offer nutritious food
that tastes good or has programs to deal with overweight patients or
other problems, he said.
   ``The consumer doesn't want to know whether two years ago (the
temperature of the water in) a dishwasher was off by two degrees,''
he said.
   William L. Roper, head of the Health Care Financing
Administration which oversees Medicare and Medicaid and put out the
report, said the 32 indicators checked in the inspections were the
most important ones affecting care of the elderly.
   ``They are not trivial items,'' he said on NBC. ``We think this
is important information.'' But he also cautioned that the report
should not substitute for visits to homes before one is chosen.
   ``It's not a definitive study of the level of care in all nursing
homes,'' Roper said, referring to it as ``a snapshot of conditions
fouind on a given day.''
   Roper, in releasing the huge stacks of printed reports Thursday
for each state, called the project ``a landmark achievement, not
because it is an end in itself but because it will help people pose
thoughtful, further questions in seeking out a nursing home.''
   The most recent of the inspection reports forming the basis for
the HCFA report were six months old, and some go back as much as 18
months.
   By law, the latest reports must be available for inspection on
the premises of each nursing home, and both government and industry
officials urged consumers to inspect them before making a final
judgment on a particular facility.
   Elma Holder, director of the National Citizens' Coalition for
Nursing Home Reform, said Roper ``should be embarrassed and ashamed
to present these documents so proudly. ... At best they provide a
teaser to the consumers to try to obtain a copy of the full survey
report of the facility.''
   She suggested conditions are worse in the nation's nursing homes
than the report indicates.
   The American Association of Retired Persons, on the other hand,
praised the report as a ``good start'' toward full disclosure of
information about nursing home quality.
   ``We are pleased that the federal government has taken valuable
information about the quality of nursing home care out of its
computers and made it available to the individuals and families who
need it most,'' said AARP Executive Director Horace Deets.
   AARP has arranged to have copies of the report available at its
regional offices around the nation. Copies also will be supplied to
various government and private organizations concerned with nursing
home standards in the various states.
   In addition to problems with food sanitation and drug
distribution, the report found 24.7 percent failed to meet standards
for isolation techniques to prevent the spread of infection and 21.6
percent failed in rehabilitative care to promote maximum physical
functioning and prevent loss of ability to walk and otherwise move
freely.
   None of the other 27 categories registered an ``unmet''
percentage above 20 percent.
   At the top end, the report shows that 99.7 percent of nursing
homes meet requirements for discharging or transferring patients;
99.6 percent allow residents to communicate freely with others; 99.5
percent provide emergency medical services as necessary.

   Actors decorated in dollar signs pranced in
the streets and posters called for boycotts of Union Carbide
products today on the eve of the fourth anniversary of the world's
worst industrial accident.
   The death toll from the Dec. 3, 1984, gas leak at the Union
Carbide pesticide plant has reached 3,329, according to the Madhra
Pradesh state government. In the last four months, at least 188
people have died of lingering effects of the methyl isocyanate gas
they inhaled, officials said.
   ``We are registering more than one death a day because of the
effects of the gas,'' Gas Relief Commissioner S. Sathyam said in an
interview.
   A year ago, the death toll recorded by Sathyam and his staff
stood at 2,850.
   Activist groups and opposition politicians have called for two
days of demonstrations to commemmorative the disaster and press for
relief for the victims. A $3 billion damage case filed by the Indian
government against Union Carbide, a Danbury, Conn.-based
multinational, has yet to be resolved.
   Police set up barricides around the derelict pesticide plant,
which was operated by Union Carbide's Indian subsidary, in an effort
to thwart any attempts to invade the deserted premises.
   The Communist Party of India has vowed that some of its followers
will force their way inside on Saturday.
   Local theater groups today sent actors into nearby streets
dressed as devils. Garbed in black costumes decorated with white
dollar signs, the actors denounced what they called the imperialism
of multinational corporations.
   Speaking in Hindi, they enacted skits in which doctors demanded
huge sums of money to treat gas victims and vote-hungry politicians
made unfulfilled promises of relief.
   Posters appeared around Bhopal, a city of 1 million, calling for
boycotts of batteries and other Union Carbide products manufactured
in India.
   Another opposition party, the Bharatiya Janata, pitched a tent
opposite the Union Carbide plant, recited Hindu scriptures and
prayed for the souls of the gas victims.
   The gas leak began when liquid methyl isocyanate leaked out of a
storage tank and turned into deadly vapor as it hit the air. Union
Carbide maintains that sabotage by a disgruntled employee caused the
leak.
   The Indian government claims it was the result of negligence.

   A kidnapped Swiss Red Cross worker today
sent a letter urging Switzerland to cooperate with his captors to
``save my life.''
   The Swiss government said the hijacking and the letter, which was
authenticated by the International Committee of the Red Cross, is an
attempt to force the release of a Shiite Moslem hijacker held in
Switzerland.
   The government urged all Swiss people to leave Lebanon.
   In Beirut, the spiritual guide of pro-Iranian Shiite militants
charged that Washington has hindered the release of the nine
American hostages.
   ``I have information that the Americans are the ones who
complicated the issue of the hostages,'' Sheik Mohammed Hussein
Fadlallah said in an interview today in the weekly magazine
Ash-Shiraa.
   ``America is after resuming ties with Iran. But it wants ties
resumed without making any political concession.
   ``Iran rejects a resumption of ties unless America changes its
hostile policy toward Iran and works out some details related to
bilateral relations, including the frozen Iranian assets,'' said
Fadlallah.
   He was referring to assets frozen in the United States after
militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in November 1979 and
held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
   In Bern, Foreign Ministry official Edouard Brunner said Peter
Winkler's letter said his abduction was intended to pressure the
Swiss government.
   ``I was not kidnapped as a Red Cross delegate but as a Swiss
citizen. My government knows what my kidnappers want from it and it
has to cooperate in order to save my life,'' said the letter.
   Swiss authorities say they have not received demands from the
kidnappers and nobody has claimed responsibility for Winkler's
abduction.
   But, ``it looks very much like blackmail,'' Brunner told a news
conference.
   The plane hijacker arrested in Geneva is Hussein Hariri, 22, a
Lebanese Shiite Moslem who commandeered an Air Afrique jetliner to
Geneva in July 1987. He killed a French passenger before being
overpowered and arrested.
   Hariri is to go on trial on various charges Feb. 20 in
Switzerland's supreme court. He could face life imprisonment.
   The letter was received earlier today by a Western news agency in
Beirut. It is the first news of Winkler, 32, since he was abducted
at gunpoint Nov. 17 in the southern Lebanese city of Sidon.
   Further abductions cannot be excluded, Brunner said. The
government urged the 150 to 200 Swiss citizens living in Lebanon to
leave and told all Swiss to avoid traveling there for non-essential
reasons such as tourism, he said.
   The all-Swiss Committee of the Red Cross suspended its operations
in Sidon after Winkler's abduction and withdrew five other delegates
based in the city.
   Brunner said Switzerland will ask Syria, Lebanon, Iran and the
Palestine Liberation Organization to help secure Winkler's freedom.
   ``We appeal for the help of all governments who might be able to
use their moral and political influence,'' he said.
   Winkler's committee said in a statement that his abduction is
``an unacceptable attack against its humanitarian mission'' and
appealed for ``absolute respect'' of its personnel.

<HEAD>TV Ad For Toll Call To Santa Outrages Parents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The switchboard at a Seattle TV station lit up
like a Christmas tree after children were urged to hold a phone near
the television for the tone-activated dialing of a toll call to
Santa Claus, station officials said.
   KTZZ program director Dan Lutgen said angry parents began calling
Thursday afternoon about 10 minutes into a half-hour advertisement
called ``Here Comes Santa,'' produced locally by a firm called Phone
Quest.
   The ad, including a story line and Christmas music, offered
children a chance to talk with Santa Claus for $2 for the first
minute and 30 cents a minute thereafter.
   Reproducing the sounds used by tone-activated phones, the ad
could ``dial'' a telephone if its handset was held up to the TV
speaker.
   The ad was edited at the independent station, but was not
prescreened by station officials, Lutgen said. Once the complaints
began pouring in, he said, he ordered that the words ``ask your
parents'' be shown continuously on the screen.
   Under the station's contract with the production company, Phone
Quest must reimburse parents for calls made without their
permission, Lutgen said.
   Phone Quest audio development director Vaughan McKelvy said he
was concerned about the ``auto phone'' device when he worked on the
ad, realizing that ``some people would be upset about it.''
   McKelvy said he didn't know how many other stations agreed to
broadcast the paid program.
   Nancy Bernstrom of US West, the local phone company, said she
could not release figures on the number of calls placed during the
program.

<HEAD>Police Chief Ordered To Pay $170,000 To Man Whose Home Was Raided</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police Chief Daryl Gates was ordered by a jury
to personally pay $170,000 to a man whose nose was broken and whose
house was ransacked by anti-gang police officers searching for a
murder weapon.
   A U.S. District Court jury deliberated less than two hours before
reaching its verdict Thursday and making the award to the family of
Jessie Larez.
   Gates denounced the decision, saying it was based on faulty
evidence.
   Comments Gates made earlier this week to reporters, in which he
said that Larez was lucky that only his nose was broken, were
admitted into evidence during the trial.
   ``The integrity of the whole system of justice at the federal
level clearly mandated that these proceedings be declared a
mistrial,'' the chief said.
   Mayor Tom Bradley issued a statement urging that the verdict be
overturned.
   If the judgment is upheld, the City Council must decide whether
the city or Gates would have to pay the damages.
   The Larez family's attorney, Stephen Yagman, said the family will
only accept the punitive award if it comes out of Gates' pocket.
   ``We want to send a message to Daryl Gates and to City Hall that
this kind of lawless behavior among officers that he has ratified by
his own comments and behavior will no longer be tolerated by members
of this community,'' Yagman said.
   In October, the same jury awarded $90,000 to the Larez family
after family members testified that police conducting the 1986 raid
broke Larez's nose, pulled the hair of one of Larez's daughters,
intimidated other members of the family and broke personal property.
   That judgment, against the Police Department, involved six gang
detail officers. The department delayed a decision on appealing the
award pending Thursday's verdict.
   During the second portion of the trial, concluded Thursday, the
jury had to determine whether Gates was accountable for actions of
officers who raided the Larez home in search of a murder weapon used
in a gang slaying. The weapon was never found.
   Speaking to reporters Tuesday outside the courtroom of Judge
Robert M. Takasugi, Gates angrily denounced Yagman, Larez and the
jury. Yagman has brought several civil suits against various police
agencies over the years.
   ``How much is a broken nose worth?'' the chief asked. ``Given the
circumstances in this case ... I don't think it's worth anything.
Larez is probably lucky that's all he had broken.
   ``People keep asking me, `Chief, why don't you do something about
gang killings?' I tell my officers, `Why don't you do something
about gang killings?' And we do something, and then juries give
$90,000.''
   Deputy City Attorney Jeff Nelson, who defended the police
department in the case, called Takasugi's decision to allow Gates'
comments as evidence ``very, very damaging.''
   Nelson defended Gates' remarks, saying ``he is entitled to fair
comment just like anyone else.''

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain
told the Belgian premier today that his refusal to extradite a
pro-IRA priest has undermined confidence between their countries,
British officials said.
   A British spokesman, who demanded anonymity, told reporters:
``Mrs. Thatcher spoke to Premier Wilfried Martens of being mystified
and deeply wounded and of confidence being dented.''
   Martens told reporters he defended his position during the
private meeting with Mrs. Thatcher. His aides said her attitude was
``acerbic.''
   The confrontation came just before the start of a European
Economic Community summit during which the 12-nation west European
trade bloc will review progress in moves to create a borderless,
single-market Europe by 1992.
   Officials said the European leaders would seek to reassure the
United States and Japan, the EEC's main trading partners, that
efforts to boost trade within the European Economic Community will
not be at the expense of imports.
   A draft statement states that a single EEC market will also
benefit ``non-community countries. 1992 Europe will not close in on
itself ... will not be a fortress Europe but a partnership Europe.''
   Earlier today, a bomb damaged an EEC Commission office in Athens,
270 miles from the meeting site. It was one of four that exploded in
the Greek capital. Police said no one was injured.
   The left-wing Revolutionary Popular Struggle claimed
responsibility.
   The EEC leaders, accompanied by their foreign ministers, started
the meeting with a luncheon hosted by Greek Premier Andreas
Papandreou, the summit's chairman.
   The summit was being held at the Knights' Palace, a 14th century
castle. Greek commandos armed with automatic weapons stood guard on
the battlement of the castle gate as the leaders arrived.
   This morning, Mrs. Thatcher also met with West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, and officials said they agreed it would be useful to
have a summit meeting of the leaders of the 16 NATO nations in
London in May or June 1988.
   A meeting between Mrs. Thatcher and Charles Haughey, the Irish
prime minister, was canceled by Haughey, who was said to be upset
over Mrs. Thatcher's criticism of Ireland for failing to extradite
the pro-IRA priest.
   Last week Belgium turned down Britain's request to extradite the
priest, Patrick Ryan, and sent him instead to the Irish Republic,
where he has taken refuge with an undisclosed religious order.
   Ryan, 58, had been held in a Belgian jail since his arrest in
June.
   Belgium said the British extradition warrant, citing unspecified
charges of conspiracy to murder and to bomb, was flawed.
   In the meeting with Martens, Mrs. Thatcher attacked the Belgian
premier over the extradition of Ryan, whom British police suspect
was involved in a string of Irish Republican Army bombings and other
terrorist related offences.
   Martens said he told Mrs. Thatcher, ``this decision was taken
completely legally ... it was not a political decision.''
   The IRA, outlawed in Britain and Ireland, is fighting to end
British rule in Northern Ireland and unite the Protestant-dominated
province with the Irish republic under leftist rule.

<HEAD>Legislature Refuses To Deal With Shoreham Issue</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Legislature has allowed Gov. Mario
Cuomo's deal to buy the $5.3 billion Shoreham nuclear plant for $1
to fall through, leaving the utility free to try to open the
generating station.
   State lawmakers wrapped up a special session Thursday without
taking action on a bill to approve the deal Cuomo worked out in June
with Shoreham's owners, the Long Island Lighting Co. By failing to
act, Cuomo and the utility said the Legislature missed a deadline
that bound both sides to the agreement.
   The governor predicted Thursday night that the deal was over and
that state lawmakers had effectively decided to open Shoreham.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, tomorrow, 12:01, Dec. 2, 1988, you
ought to think of it as Black Friday,'' said Cuomo, who added that
allowing the deadline to pass could prove to be one of the ``most
tragic blunders that this Legislature ever made.''
   But the utility offered no indication of its plans.
   LILCO scheduled a meeting of its board of directors today in
Hicksville to discuss ``our future course regarding the
settlement,'' according to utility spokesman James Lois. Lois would
not speculate about what options LILCO might consider.
   The deal called for the state to buy the $5.3 billion Shoreham
facility for $1 and dismantle it. In return, the utility would get
guaranteed rate hikes over the next decade totaling more than 60
percent.
   The state, under the auspices of the New York Power Authority,
would build non-nuclear power plants to provide LILCO with the
electricity it would lose if Shoreham doesn't open, the deal also
stipulates. Cuomo says Shoreham should not be allowed to open
because crowded Long Island couldn't be safely evacuated in the
event of a serious nuclear accident.
   The Legislature's refusal to act on a Shoreham bill this week was
due mainly to the determination by the nine state senators from Long
Island, all Republicans, that the agreement as now written would be
too generous to the utility and cause rates to go up higher than
they have to for the utility's customers.
   Most of the discussion at the Capitol Thursday night in the wake
of the Legislature's departure was over whether the passing of the
midnight deadline really meant the end of the deal.
   The pro-agreement Citizens to Settle Shoreham group said
legislators had ``for all practical purposes opened Shoreham.'' That
organization called Long Island legislators ``gutless'' for not
dealing with the issue.
   According to Lois, the Shoreham agreement stipulates only that
the parties involved are ``free to withdraw'' starting today, not
that the pact falls apart.
   But Cuomo argued by the time any new agreement is reached,
Shoreham could be on its way to winning a license to operate from
the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission and LILCO would lose its
incentive to renegotiate the pact.
   The governor maintained that the plant could be licensed to
operate as early as Dec. 12.

   The remains of five bodies, four of
them confirmed to be women, have been found along two highways in
southeastern Massachusetts, prompting worry that a serial killer
might be behind the deaths.
   ``There are things that are not coincidence, that are in
common,'' Bristol County District Attorney Ronald A. Pina said after
the fifth body was found Thursday. ``It would appear ... they are
connected.''
   ``They are all in a geographic location which is very similar,''
he said of the bodies found a couple of exits from each other along
Interstate 195 and Route 140 in southeastern Massachusetts.
   Pina also said his office has turned up additional evidence that
it has not disclosed.
   State police using specially trained dogs resumed a search today
of the area near where the partially clothed skeleton was found
Thursday.
   The body was located by police dogs along Route 140 in Freetown,
less than three miles from where the first body was discovered in
July, officials said.
   Thomas Gibney, a spokesman for Pina, said police used
searchlights Thursday night but found no evidence to help the
investigation. An autospy was scheduled today, he said.
   ``We're hoping we found the last of them and we just have to put
some of the pieces together,'' Gibney said.
   Gibney said investigators believed the fifth victim also was a
woman because of the style of the clothing, dungarees and a light
shirt. He said the body was severely decomposed and may have been
there for up to a year.
   The district attorney has linked the bodies to the disappearance
of several women from New Bedford's Weld Square area, known by
police as a center for drug trading and prostitution.
   LouAnn Silva, a resident of Weld Square, said she worried about
her 15-year-old daughter. ``I'm scared to go to the store myself,''
she said.
   The four also may be connected with the deaths of two women from
Providence, R.I., whose bodies were found last spring in Seekonk
near Interstate 195 and about 10 miles away in Attleboro near
Interstate 95, Pina said.
   Pina said he believes the killer was familiar with the area.
   ``I personally don't believe it could have been someone traveling
through,'' he said. ``It looks like it was someone who was more
local, someone who knew the area, someone who felt confident enough
that they could go there and drop a body off by the road and leave.''
   Officials undertook the search after a body was found last month
along Interstate 195 in Dartmouth, not far from where two bodies
were discovered in July.
   Police dogs Tuesday found the skeletal remains of a fourth woman
along the interstate in Dartmouth. None of the women has been
positively identified.
   Dental records of five women reported missing here in recent
months were being checked to see if they match any of the bodies.
Three of the missing women were either last seen, lived near or
frequented the Weld Square area.
   Jimmy Giammalvo, whose family has run a grocery store on the
corner of Weld Square since 1922, said little has changed since the
first body was found.
   ``They (prostitutes) come in and out of here all the time. It's
business as usual,'' he said.

   Kids may love Santa, but when 25 of the jolly old
fellows show up en masse, the pleasure turns to terror and tears,
and children run for their mothers' skirts.
   So it was when a festive phalanx of red-suited, black-booted Kris
Kringles _ excited graduates of a Santa school _ invaded a downtown
hotel lobby to a chorus of ho-ho-hos.
   ``I really love kids, but I didn't realize they'd be so scared,''
Chris Davis, 19, of San Diego, said Wednesday. ``I reached out to
shake one's hand and she started crying.''
   Veteran Santa Leonard Utecht, 68, with 48 years behind the beard,
used the incident to teach the new dogs old tricks.
   ``Don't reach down to the little ones from above or they'll
retreat,'' Utecht counseled. ``If you stoop to their level, you can
win them over.''
   The basics? Know all the reindeers' names. Forgo alcohol, tobacco
and garlic. Don't make any specific promises. And gently hold the
child's hand _ it's soothing and keeps him from grabbing the beard.
   The St. Nick novices were enthralled with their duties, although
they found the outfit a bit stifling for climates south of the North
Pole.
   ``I'm working up a real sweat,'' Davis said.
   ``With a little practice, we'll get used to it,'' said Jaymes
Regualos, 18, of Battle Creek, Mich., of the pillow padding and
warm, silky beards. ``I love doing this. It's lots of fun.''
   The bravest youngster on hand was Nadia Sawtarie from Japan.
   The 3-year-old assessed the invaders from behind her mother's
skirts and then gathered the courage to venture out and offer a
tentative wave before scurrying back to safety.
   Santa is known in Japan, but not on such a scale, her mother said.

<HEAD>National Security Adviser Getting Fourth Star, Army Command</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto WX6</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell, the career soldier
who became national security adviser in 1987, has been chosen by
President Reagan to command Army forces in the United States.
   The move by the 51-year-old son of Jamaican immigrants from
national security adviser to full general and command of U.S. Forces
Command would put Powell back in the running to become Army chief of
staff eventually.
   Powell would also become only the fourth black officer to attain
four-star rank in the U.S. armed forces if the Senate confirms the
nomination.
   He would join Air Force Gen. Bernard P. Randolph as the second
black four-star officer currently on active duty.
   The first such officer in American history was Air Force Gen.
Daniel ``Chappie'' James, who won his rank in August 1975. He died
shortly after retiring in 1978. The second was Army Gen. Roscoe
Robinson, who won his fourth star on Aug. 30, 1982, and retired in
November 1985.
   In taking over Forces Command at Fort McPherson in Atlanta, Ga.,
Powell would succeed Gen. Joseph T. Palastra Jr., who has held the
post since June 1986 and is retiring after 35 years of active
military service.
   The change of command will probably occur in April, the Army
said. The Forces Command oversees both active duty and reserve
troops in the United States, except Hawaii, which falls under the
Pacific command.
   The Army has 11 full generals, but sources at the Pentagon said
the Forces Command position was likely to be the only four-star post
to open during the next year and that rumors had been circulating
for some time that Powell was in line for the job. ``The White House
handled this one directly,'' said one official.
   A tall, husky man described as a ``soldier's soldier'' who
doesn't particularly like staff jobs, Powell has received uniformly
high marks from official Washington for his performance at the White
House.
   White House Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Powell and Reagan
``have had a close personal relationship.''
   ``He was the general who guided preparations for the Gorbachev
summits, who helped restructure and give new direction to the
National Security Council following the Iran-Contra investigation,
and who, by his personal integrity and commitment, has restored
confidence in the national Security Council itself,'' Fitzwater said.
   Powell succeeded Frank C. Carlucci as Reagan's national security
adviser after Carlucci was tapped to replace the retiring Caspar W.
Weinberger as defense secretary a year ago.
   Carlucci had replaced Navy Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter, who
resigned when the arms-for-hostage affair became public.
   Powell first came to the attention of Weinberger and Carlucci
when he was tapped as a White House fellow in 1972. He served as
Weinberger's top military aide from 1983 to 1986, then joined the
NSC staff as Carlucci's deputy after brief service as commander of
the Army's V Corps in West Germany.
   Powell was born in New York City to Jamaican immigrants. He is a
graduate of the City College of New York and received a master's
degree in business administration from George Washington University
here.
   Commissioned in the infantry in 1958, he was wounded twice during
two tours in Vietnam, once falling into a trap lined with sharpened
bamboo sticks and impaling a foot.
   His decorations include the Distinguished Service Medal, the
Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.
   Powell and his wife, Alma, have two daughters and a son.

<TEXT>
   A judge today rejected Oliver L. North's
remaining challenges to Iran-Contra charges against him, but the
Reagan administration's refusal to release classified document could
still scuttle the major charges.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell rejected the last of the
former White House aide's pre-trial motions. North had moved to
dismiss charges that he obstructed congressional inquiries into
press reports he was violating a ban on helping the Nicaraguan
rebels, known as Contras.
   Gesell's rulings capped a series of decisions on North's 37
pre-trial motions that left intact 14 of the 16 charges against the
former National Security Council aide.
   But major counts against North could be dropped if Gesell decides
the defense cannot argue its case without classified documents being
withheld by the Reagan administration.
   President Reagan insists that the documents are being withheld
for national security reasons, and says the decision is not a ploy
to prevent North from going to trial.
   ``The things we're blocking are the things that duty requires we
block,'' Reagan said Thursday. ``These are things that are national
security secrets.''
   Asked if the move were a backdoor maneuver to keep the case
against North from going to trial, he replied: ``No, this is
something that from the very beginning we knew we would have to do.''
   Reagan was questioned at the beginning of a meeting on
forthcoming trade talks. Although he defended the decision to
withhold documents from the trial, he backed away from his previous
insistence that North and his former boss, John M. Poindexter, are
innocent.
   On June 27, Reagan had said: ``I believe in the innocence of the
two men and I would like to see that established once and for all.''
   On Thursday, Reagan said, ``At this stage I don't think I should
comment on guilt or innocence or anything of this kind. I think the
law has got to take its course.''
   Still, the decision to withhold classified documents could enable
North's lawyers to claim that he is being prevented from presenting
a full defense to the key allegation against him _ that he conspired
illegally to divert more than $14 million in profits from the Reagan
administration's secret Iranian weapons deals to the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels.
   North's lawyers claim that they need some 40,000 pages of secret
documents to defend him. Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, the
special prosecutor assigned to the case, has indicated he can
proceed without use of the classified information.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said heads of government
agencies concerned with national security decided in July not to
release some material sought for the trial. He said Walsh indicated
at the time that he could prosecute North on the basis of
unclassified material.
   North's lawyers, however, are insisting on use of the classified
material. Gesell today resumed closed hearings on defense objections
to deleting classified material from 350 prosecution exhibits.
   The secret materials bear most heavily on two charges relating to
the diversion _ conspiracy and theft of government property.
However, North also could be tried on charges he made false
statements to Congress and conspired to use a tax-exempt foundation
for a non-exempt purpose _ raising money for the Contras.
   In a court filing made public late Thursday, Walsh disclosed some
of the types of information that the Reagan administration is
preventing him from using. It includes the already widely publicized
names of several Central American countries, and the names of
officials from those nations, involved in aiding the Contras.
   Walsh's document also indicates that the administration is trying
to suppress the names of nations from which it tried to solicit
secret contributions for the Contras, including Saudi Arabia and
South Korea.
   Fitzwater said the White House has offered a briefing to U.S.
District Judge Gerhard Gesell, who is scheduled to preside over
North's trial, but had not received a response. Fitzwater said it
was ``up to the judge'' to decide if the classified material is
relevant to North's defense and, if it is, whether the indictments
against him should be dismissed or he should be tried.
   Gesell said recently that he would have little power to control
the flow of information once the trial started, but noted that the
White House had legal and constitutional means at its disposal to
prevent disclosures.
   Fitzwater said White House officials realized, when they heard
this, that Gesell had not been advised of the action that had been
taken in July.
   Consequently, White House Counsel A.B. Culvahouse wrote Walsh a
letter on the issue. Of the 40,000 or so pages sought by North, the
administration advised Walsh that ``there is information in those
documents that we know we cannot declassify,'' Fitzwater said.
   Reagan, meanwhile, reiterated that he is opposed to a
presidential pardon for North and the other Iran-Contra defendants
while the criminal case is pending. He said pardons would leave them
``under a shadow of guilt for the rest of their lives.''

<HEAD>Blood Bank Held Responsible For Transfusion-Related AIDS Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER McNULTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury verdict that found a blood bank
negligent for allowing an infant to get AIDS through a transfusion
will affect hundreds of similar cases across the country, an
attorney says.
   Additionally, the nation's blood supply could be significantly
improved if blood banks raise their standards in light of Thursday's
decision, a key witness in the case said.
   In a verdict believed to be the first of its kind, a jury found
the Irwin Memorial Blood Bank of San Francisco was negligent in
failing to properly screen its blood supply for the virus that
causes AIDS.
   The jury also found that the blood bank, which supplies blood to
about 40 hospitals in eight counties in Northern California, erred
when it rejected requests by the boy's family and friends to donate
blood for the transfusions.
   ``It shows blood banks that they are indeed vulnerable to jury
verdicts,'' said plaintiff's attorney Michael Moriarty.
   The suit was filed on behalf of Michael Osborn, now 5{, who was
three weeks old when he received AIDS-contaminated blood in 1983
during surgery for a congenital heart defect. He tested positive for
the AIDS virus in September 1987.
   Michael now has a brain tumor and lymphoma. He has only a few
months to live, said Moriarty.
   The jury awarded Michael $550,000 in compensatory damages. His
parents were awarded $200,000 to pay for past and future medical and
nursing bills.
   Superior Court Judge Andrew Ertola did not allow the jury to
consider awarding punitive damages, nor was the jury allowed to give
the parents any damages for pain and suffering, said Moriarty.
   Moriarty said the financial cost may motivate blood banks to
``police themselves more than they are now.'' He said hundreds of
similar cases are pending across the country.
   The blood bank plans to appeal, said Irwin's attorney, Duncan
Barr.
   Barr defended Irwin's decisions in the case. ``In February of
1983, there was only one case of AIDS from a transfusion in the
world,'' he said. ``There was not evidence at that time that this
was a disease transmitted by blood.''
   But Dr. Thomas Asher, a key witness for the family, disputed
Barr's assertion that there was no evidence in 1983 that AIDS was
transmitted by blood. ``Everybody knew it,'' he said.
   Asher, founder and chairman of HemaCare Corp., a private,
for-profit blood bank in Sherman Oaks, called the verdict ``a
marvelous thing.''
   ``Any time more pressure is put on the blood bankers to improve
the quality of their product, the better it'll be for the members of
the public who receive it,'' he said.
   Both Barr and Asher said it was the first time a blood bank had
been found responsible for a transfusion-related AIDS case. Other
cases have gone to court, but have not resulted in verdicts.
   Asher said that although many blood banks have improved their
screening and recruiting in the past few years, others have not.
   ``Much of the blood industry is still dragging their feet,'' he
said. ``Rather than working harder and recruiting harder, they're
willing to let questionable blood and questionable donors go through
their system.''
   Mary Osborn, Michael's mother, said she and her husband were
thrilled by the jury's decision.
   ``We just feel this is a great moral victory,'' she said. ``I
think the blood industry, particularly in high-risk areas like San
Francisco, has got to shape up.''
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the body's immune
system, leaving victims vulnerable to infections. The virus is
spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared
by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant
women to their offspring.
   As of Dec. 1, 79,389 cases had been reported since June 1981, and
44,590, or 56 percent of all victims, had died.

   A senior Arab diplomat said today that
member states will pass a resolution to move the General Assembly to
Geneva so PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, barred from entering the
United States, can address the body.
   On Thursday night, the United States refused the assembly's
request to grant Arafat a visa. Arafat planned to speak about the
Palestinian situation.
   ``This reply from the United States is negative and will be
contained in a report by the secretary-general to come out tomorrow
morning,'' U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said Thursday night.
   A diplomat who saw the United States' response said it was
``extremely negative.'' It replied to a General Assembly resolution
urging Washington to reverse its decision and respond within 24
hours. The resolution passed 151-2 Wednesday, with the United States
and Israel opposed.
   The State Department said it denied Arafat a visa because he
encourages and condones terrorism by the Palestine Liberation
Organization. Washington has said it does not object to the assembly
shifting to Geneva and would participate in a session held there.
   The senior Arab diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the resolution would be introduced to the General Assembly this
afternoon and would pass by tonight.
   U.N. comptroller Luis Maria Gomez confirmed the Arab nations
introduced their resolution before one of two budgetary committees
that must consider it before it goes before the whole Assembly.
   Arab and U.N. sources said the Geneva session would be held
sometime Dec. 12-16. Revised estimates put the cost of the session
at $500,000, said the Arab diplomat.
   Arafat has said he wants to explain the new position taken by the
PLO's Palestine National Council in its recent meeting in Algiers.
   The council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile, implicitly recognized
Israel's right to exist, accepting key U.N. resolutions on the
Middle East calling for negotiations with states in the region.
   A rally planned to welcome Arafat on Thursday turned into a
protest outside the United Nations. About 400 people including
Palestinians and a few dozen anti-Zionist Orthodox Jews denounced
the visa denial.
   Waving PLO flags and pictures of Arafat, the demonstrators
chanted ``Long Live the PLO.''
   Holding anti-Zionist banners were ultra-Orthodox Jewish men in
long black coats and wide-brimmed hats. Orthodox Jews Against
Zionism believe God has forbidden the Jewish people to have their
own state.
   Geneva is the European headquarters of the United Nations. The
General Assembly has never met outside New York since the U.N.
headquarters were built in the city in 1952.
   The resolution on moving to Geneva must be heard by a 16-member
budgetary advisory committee then go to the General Assembly's
finance committee, which would vote on it and send it to the General
Assembly for a vote.
   The PLO has had a U.N. mission in New York since 1975 and holds
non-voting observer status at the world body. It is considered the
sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people and is
invited to speak on all debates concerning Palestinians and the
Middle East.

   A leader of Angola's anti-communist insurgency
today criticized the pending agreement that will provide for the
withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola, contending that the accord
undercounts the Cuban presence by 10,000.
   Jeremias K. Chitunda, vice president of the UNITA forces since
1986, said the agreement being negotiated in U.S.-mediated talks
calls for the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban forces over a 27-month
period.
   Chitunda said in an interview that the removal of that number of
Cubans would still leave 10,000 at the disposal of Angola's leftist
government after the withdrawal timetable ends.
   In addition, he said, 20,000 other Cubans have been given Angolan
citizenship and are capable of providing assistance to the Angolan
Army.
   ``There is very little in it for us to rejoice about,'' Chitunda
said, alluding to the agreement being worked out by officials from
South Africa, Angola and Cuba.
   The State Department said it stands by its estimate that the
Cuban troop presence numbers about 50,000. It also disputed
Chitunda's claim that 20,000 Cubans have acquired Angolan
citizenship.
   Final details of the agreement were being negotiated this week in
the Congolese capital of Brazzaville. Chester Crocker, the State
Department's top official for African affairs, is serving as
mediator for the talks.
   In addition to the withdrawal of Cuban troops, the accord is also
aimed at bringing about independence and black majority rule in
Namibia, a colony of South Africa. A treaty implementing the
agreement is expected to be ready for signature in a few weeks.
   The Reagan administration has been providing assistance to UNITA
since 1985 but Chitunda's remarks reflect what has been an
undercurrent of uneasiness between the two allies.
   South Africa has been UNITA's main supplier but that role is
expected to end once South African forces depart Namibia as part of
the independence process in the territory.
   Chitunda said UNITA has become increasingly self-sufficient and
should be able to survive a South African aid suspension.
   Another shortcoming of the agreement, Chitunda said, is that it
does not provide for a process of national reconciliation in Angola,
which has been plagued by civil war since independence in 1975.
   He said that UNITA's main political objective is negotiations
with Angolan authorities leading to a process of national
reconciliation and multi-party democracy.
   ``We do not seek military superiority,'' he said. ``We do not
seek military victory.''
   Angolan officials have refused to hold national reconciliation
talks, calling instead on the UNITA rebels to take advantange of a
government amnesty offer.

   Two South African government ministers
joined U.S.-mediated talks today aimed at wrapping up an interim
agreement on a Cuban troop withdrawal from Angola and independence
for South-West Africa.
   But Defense Minister Magnus Malan, who flew to the Congolese
capital today with Foreign Minister Pik Botha, said there was a
``serious hitch'' in the talks, the independent South Africa Press
Association reported.
   ``This is the time when the pitfalls start appearing,'' Malan was
quoted as saying by the news agency. The report did not elaborate.
   One reported disagreement has involved South Africa's insistence
on a reliable system for verifying the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban
troops supporting Angola's Marxist government in fighting a rebel
war.
   A statement issued in Pretoria before their arrival in
Brazzaville said it was hoped the agreement would be signed today or
Saturday.
   In any case, further negotiations will be required after the
signing of what is to be called the Brazzaville Protocol, before a
formal treaty is signed. The formal agreement was to be signed in
New York, perhaps next month.
   Delegations from South Africa, Angola and Cuba arrived earlier
this week for what was expected to be a final round of negotiations
on the details of agreements ironed out in the past six months of
U.S.-mediated talks.
   Angola's government is fighting a 13-year-old war with the UNITA
rebel movement.
   UNITA receives assistance from South Africa and the United
States. UNITA, which has not been a party to the peace talks, has
vowed to continue fighting.
   The protocol also calls for South Africa to begin granting
independence to South-West Africa, also known as Namibia. South
Africa has administered the territory for 73 years.
   The Weekly Mail newspaper in Johannesburg reported that UNITA
forces have been moving from southern Angola into Namibia. However,
the South African military has denied UNITA has any guerrilla
fighters in Namibia.

<TEXT>
   A school reform measure for Chicago that
calls for the creation of local school councils and a new central
Board of Education has overwhelmingly won the approval of the
Illinois General Assembly.
   Final approval came on a 98-8 vote in the House late Thursday.
The Senate approved it 56-1 earlier in the evening.
   ``I think that it is a good bill, well-balanced, well-founded,
and I am very hopeful that it will make significant change in the
Chicago school system,'' said House Speaker Michael Madigan.
   The bill represents the General Assembly's second effort on
school reform. A Democratic-drafted bill was approved in July but
was abandoned early in the fall session amid a partisan dispute over
changes proposed by Gov. James R. Thompson.
   Drafted by a bipartisan legislative group, the measure is
designed to shift the balance of power in the school system by
trimming the central school bureaucracy and creating local school
councils with authority to appoint principals at each of the city's
592 public schools.
   Principals will be given more authority over hiring and over
attempts to improve the work of teachers who are deemed
unsatisfactory.
   The current 11-member Chicago Board of Education will be replaced
with a seven-member interim board to be appointed by the mayor. A
school board nominating commission will make recommendations to the
mayor for a permanent 15-member board.
   The existing Chicago School Finance Authority will serve as a
watchdog over the reform effort, and can suspend or fire any school
board member or employee who doesn't comply with its directives.
   Lawmakers of both parties acknowledged the bill dealt primarily
with the management of the school system but did not address such
issues as overcrowding, dropouts and early childhood education that
require major funding increases.

<TEXT>
   Infantry units mutinied today at a
large army base outside the capital, and a rebel officer said the
move was aimed at replacing the army chief and not civilian
President Raul Alfonsin.
   It was unclear how many soldiers were taking part in the
insurrection, and there were no reports of gunfire or injuries by
early afternoon. The Campo de Mayo base was the fourth military
outpost reporting unrest in two days.
   The army sent loyal troops to the base and reported other bases
nationwide were calm. Vice President Victor Martinez convened
emergency meetings to discuss the rebellion with Cabinet ministers
and military chiefs.
   Alfonsin is in New York to address the U.N. General Assembly.
   The rebel officer, who identified himself only as an aide to Col.
Mohamed Ali Seineldin, said the revolt was not against Alfonsin
government.
   ``Our posture is one of absolute respect for the Constitution,''
he said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. He said
the rebellion was aimed at toppling the army chief, Gen. Jose Dante
Caridi.
   Seineldin ``is raising arms against the authorities of the force
in a definitive attempt to restore the honor of the army and its
historic role,'' the officer said from the base, 20 miles northeast
of Buenos Aires.
   The insurrection followed incidents Thursday in which 53 coast
guard men armed themselves and deserted their base and an captain
attempted to incite infantry troops at La Tablada, west of Buenos
Aires. The Defense Ministry said the captain was arrested.
   Government officials had believed those incidents, and another
failed uprising at an army communications facility in City Bell, 25
miles south of the capital, had been isolated.
   Today they were treating the Campo de Mayo revolt as part of the
same unrest and trying to make sure there were no other pockets of
dissent.
   The elite coast guard unit on Thursday deserted their base in
three trucks, into which they loaded four light machine guns, 200
rifles, 30 handguns and 100,000 rounds of ammunition, officials said.
   The Diario y Noticias news agency reported the coast guard unit
was inside the Campo de Mayo base today.
   At the base, no clashes were reported, but rebels in combat gear
put a heavy machine gun at the entrance to the military school and
took in weapons.
   The military action was denounced on all sides.
   ``No action of this type is capable of threatening democracy,''
said Eduardo Angeloz, presidential candidate of Alfonsin's Radical
Civic Union.
   Carlos Menem, the opposition Peronist Party candidate in the May
1988 elections, said: ``If it were necessary, I don't doubt the
Argentine people would mobilize in defense of democracy.''
   Elements within the army have complained about Caridi's
leadership, the selection of officers for promotion and retirement,
the military budget that under Alfonsin has shrunk by half, and pay
that has not kept pace with 332 percent inflation.
   Officers also are unhappy about the resumption of trials against
colleagues charged with human rights abuses in the crackdown on
leftist subversion during the 1976-83 dictatorship.
   The 1987 and 1988 uprisings led by Lt. Col. Aldo Rico, now
discharged and imprisoned, were motivated to support fellow officers
being prosecuted in civilian courts, and reflected the unwillingness
of colleagues who were called to testify.
   During the dictatorship, kidnappings, bombings and assassinations
by leftist groups were curtailed, but at least 9,000 Argentines
``disappeared'' and were presumed executed by security forces, a
government commission reported.
   In December 1985, five former junta members, including former
military presidents Jorge Videla and Roberto Viola, were convicted
in civilian court for crimes including kidnapping, torture and
murder.

   A federal judge today approved a
precedent-setting order requiring the U.S. Department of Energy to
be subject to Ohio environmental regulations in a $1 billion cleanup
of the agency's Fernald uranium processing plant.
   Ohio Attorney General Anthony Celebrezze Jr. and Sen. John Glenn,
D-Ohio, said the decree, negotiated by federal and state attorneys,
is historic because it gives the state a court-enforceable order to
pressure the Energy Department to clean up the plant. Celebrezze and
Glenn said it is the first such agreement they know of.
   Celebrezze and Richard Shank, the Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency director, said Ohio will use the order to force the Energy
Department to clean up the plant and pay for its cost, estimated at
$1 billion.
   U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel signed the agreement this
morning in Cincinnati, Celebrezze said.
   The accord covers the Feed Materials Production Center in
Fernald, which state officials blame for contamination of air and
water at the 1,050-acre site 18 miles north of Cincinnati. The plant
enriches uranium for nuclear power plants and for the government's
nuclear research efforts.
   The announcement of the agreement Thursday came as the plant's
operator announced plans to lay off 350 workers because of decreased
demand for its product.
   Glenn said Fernald's problems date through 35 years of Washington
administrations and predecessors to the Energy Department, as well
as today's administration.
   ``There's plenty of blame to go around,'' said Glenn, who
conducted a 1984 congressional hearing to help bring to public
attention Fernald's environmental problems of stored radioactive
wastes and atmospheric releases of radioactive uranium oxide dust.
   Production at the 37-year-old Feed Materials Production Center
has been halted since the start of a strike by union workers Oct. 7.
   Glenn said the Energy Department estimates it will cost $175
billion to clean up 17 federal nuclear sites during the next 35
years. He said only $300 million is budgeted for the job in the
coming year.
   Today's agreement resulted from negotiations prompted by two Ohio
lawsuits, filed in 1986 and 1987, against the Energy Department. The
agreement, in the form of a court decree, requires the Energy
Department to pay more than $1 million as a result of the lawsuits.
   The plant also is the subject of a $300 million class action in
U.S. District Court in Cincinnati on behalf of Fernald neighbors who
contend the plant has radioactively contaminated the environment,
posed a health hazard and ruined property values.
   Lisa Crawford, spokeswoman for Fernald Residents for
Environmental Safety and Health, declined to comment specifically on
the agreement until she reviews it.
   But, she said, ``I want to see this thing written in stone,
etched in stone, and it's got to be enforceable.''
   Jim Alexander, spokesman for the Energy Department's Oak Ridge,
Tenn., operations, which include the Fernald plant, said the
agreement is evidence of the Energy Department's intent to clean up
Fernald, but is not an admission of wrongdoing.
   Joe La Grone, the Energy Department's manager of Oak Ridge
operations, said this week that the government will have spent $355
million by the end of fiscal 1989 on cleanup and work place safety
efforts already under way at Fernald.
   The plant sits above the Great Miami River aquifer, a water
source for 2 million people. The Energy Department has admitted the
plant has emitted at least 300,000 pounds of radioactive uranium
dust into the atmosphere.
   Shank said the state is concerned that contaminated wastes from
the plant could eventually pollute the aquifer. Water sampling has
not revealed any notable contamination in regional public water
supplies, but monitoring will continue, Shank told reporters.
   Also Thursday, Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio, the plant's
operator, said it would lay off 350 workers.
   Spokesman Pete Kelley said the layoffs will affect about 250
hourly and about 100 salaried employees. He said the layoffs were
not prompted by a strike by the plant's 625 union production
workers, which has idled the facility since Oct. 7.
   Some employees foresaw difficulties in cleaning up the
37-year-old plant if workers are laid off.
   ``It will about destroy the place as far as cleanup goes,'' said
Bob Warren, who has worked at the Fernald plant for seven years.
   ``If they're being honest about cleaning up the plant, then they
wouldn't lay off 250 of the people who know how to do the cleanup,''
said David Day, president of the Atomic Trades Labor Council, which
represents the 14 unions at the plant.
   Westinghouse laid off 70 employees at the plant in April because
of declining orders for uranium and said then that more layoffs were
likely.
   Fernald currently employs about 1,500 people.

<HEAD>Grand Jury Blames Philadelphia Inspections Office For Six Fires</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A grand jury has blamed mismanagement in the
city's Department of Licenses and Inspections for at least six fires
since 1984 that caused more than $23 million in damage and killed
two people.
   The agency is a ``bureaucracy that does not react to danger,''
said District Attorney Ronald Castille.
   The Philadelphia County grand jury condemned the city
department's exclusive enforcement of the fire code, but did not
accuse any official of wrongdoing. The grand jury said the system
was at fault rather than the people.
   ``The present system promotes inefficiency by permitting
decisions without accountability, ignoring advice from the fire
department, failing to follow up field inspector requests for action
and failing to coordinate and utilize the information in its
system,'' the grand jury said Thursday.
   Castille sent a letter to Mayor W. Wilson Goode urging him and
the City Council to strip the department of its fire code
enforcement power and put the fire department in charge. City
officials had no response today.
   William Wolfe, the assistant district attorney who handled the
grand jury investigation, said inspectors did their jobs on the six
buildings that later burned, but their reports ``went into the black
hole of L&I, where their supervisors did nothing.''
   The grand jury review of inspection and licensing agency
practices covered six fires between May 1984 and December 1987,
including the Nov. 7, 1984, explosion at the Publicker Distillery,
where two workers died, and a nine-alarm fire on May 3, 1984, that
caused an estimated $20 million in damage to 17 buildings.
   The panel also recommended that criminal charges be filed against
one building owner who allegedly ignored safety citations and the
owner of a company that installs fire alarm and sprinkler systems
for allegedly illegally obtaining an occupancy permit.

<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ The record buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc.
has stirred dreams of big stock profits and hopes that the company's
corporate headquarters would return to this tobacco city, but it
also brought fears of layoffs.
   ``I think the general feeling is one of uncertainty,'' Fred
Nordenholz, president of the Winston-Salem Chamber of Commerce, said
Thursday. ``There are lots of mixed feelings about what's
happening.''
   The food and tobacco giant was auctioned off to buyout firm
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. late Wednesday in a $24.53 billion
deal valued at about $109 a share in cash and securities.
   That is virtually double the stock's price before management
started a bidding war six weeks ago and represents a big windfall
for this city. Analysts estimate that about 9,000 people in the area
plus local trusts, foundations and retirement plans own stock now
worth a little more than $2 billion.
   At Windsor Jewelers in downtown Winston-Salem, Lois Simon said
she has already noticed an influx of potential new customers who
appear to be looking for ways to spend the proceeds they will get
from the sale of their stock.
   ``These are definitely not typical of the clientele that would be
pricing our emeralds and diamonds,'' she said.
   However, Chamber of Commerce Chairman John Davis said stories of
production-line workers becoming millionaires were ``a bit
overstated.''
   ``There are some people who are suddenly quarter-millionaires, on
paper anyway,'' he said.
   Some local businessmen hope RJR will return its corporate
headquarters, which were shifted to Atlanta last year, to
Winston-Salem, bringing jobs and prestige back as well. The company
has kept its R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. subsidiary, the nation's
second largest cigarette maker, based here throughout.
   Expectations of any windfalls are tempered because Kohlberg
Kravis will use unprecedented amounts of borrowed money to acquire
RJR. Locals expect belt-tightening measures to enable the company to
pay off its massive debt which could include layoffs, even in the
hugely profitable tobacco business.
   ``Some people are going to have greater personal wealth than ever
before, and that's balanced by a certain amount of anxiety about
where the company's headed and what's going to happen to their
careers,'' Nordenholz said.
   Davis, who is also a managing partner of the investment firm
Alex. Brown and Sons, said the city could emerge in better shape
when the financial smoke clears.
   ``Tobacco is fairly recession-resistant, as is most of the food
business,'' he said. ``Things may be tight for a year, 18 months.
But profits have been in the 20 to 25 percent range. ... What are
you going to do, lay people off because you're making more money? It
doesn't work that way.''
   Rick Weddle, director of Winston-Salem Business Inc., said
layoffs could actually help his firm lure other industry to the
area. A local unemployment rate of about 3 percent has left the area
short of skilled labor, he said.
   ``I am probably one of the few people alive who sees opportunity
in employment reductions,'' he said.
   Many local shareholders may seek to spend some of their sudden
windfall, business owners said.
   Davis said other shareholders are looking to reinvest their
profits.
   Wade Spache, a maintenance technician at R.J. Reynolds, said he
sold some of his stock earlier at $84 a share, far below the
buyout's $109 value but way above the stock's price of roughly $56
before the bidding war began Oct. 20. The stock fell $1.25 Thursday
to close at $91.75 and dropped another 75 cents this morning to $91.
   ``I just wanted to be on the safe side,'' he said. ``I didn't
want everything I had in speculation.''

   A recently sluggish Wall Street received a burst
of energy from the record bidding contest for RJR Nabisco Inc., and
it's bracing for even more takeover activity before Congress
reconvenes next year.
   ``The takeover activity has lent a real spark of life to a market
which otherwise would be in the doldrums,'' said A.C. Moore,
director of equity research at Argus Research.
   ``There's been a lot of things going on here, but there's nothing
nearly as big,'' said Eldon Grimm, a senior vice president at Birr,
Wilson & Co., who has been trading stock for nearly 60 years. ``It's
livened up the place.''
   Still reeling from the October 1987 stock market crash and
worried about higher interest rates, a sluggish economy and the
dollar, many investors had shied away from stocks in recent weeks.
   But their interest was revived when the RJR bidding war erupted
in late October, amid a wave of other multibillion-dollar takeover
attempts of big companies.
   Late Wednesday, buyout specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
emerged the apparent victor in the bidding war, when the company's
board of directors accepted its $24.53 billion offer over a slightly
larger proposal by RJR management.
   Some of the biggest winners so far are RJR stockholders, who have
seen their shares more than double in value from a year ago, from
$43 to $91 at mid-morning today. They stand to reap tens of billions
of dollars in profits once the $109-a-share merger is consummated.
   Then there are the investment bankers, such as Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. and Salomon Brothers Inc., whose business had slowed
since last year's stock market crash. They will receive substantial
fees for helping the RJR bidders put their proposals together.
   And there are lucrative fees for the commercial banks lending
money to finance the deal and for the battery of lawyers providing
contractual advice. The new owners and their investors also are
likely to reap big profits once the consumer products giant is
restructured.
   Among the losers have been holders of RJR's $5 billion in
corporate bonds, which slipped 20 percent in market value during
recent weeks. What troubles bondholders is that the buyout will be
financed primarily by borrowed money, mainly through new issues of
high-yield, high-risk ``junk bonds,'' that will give the company
higher levels of debt than traditionaly have been considered prudent.
   Many other outstanding corporate issues have been hurt by the
takeover frenzy, but more money has gone into less volatile Treasury
bonds, particularly short-term issues.
   Other recent big takeover offers include the $12.6 billion merger
of Kraft Inc. with Phillip Morris Cos., and British conglomerate
Grand Metropolitan PLC's $5 billion-plus takeover attempt of
Pillsbury Co. The stock of those target companies also has risen in
value.
   Michale Metz, a technical analyst with Oppenheimer & Co., and
other analysts predict more giant takeovers offers may surface
before Congress reconvenes next year and considers how to limit
buyouts, as many lawmakers have threatened to do.
   ``I think that there is mounting pressure from various circles to
curtail activity of this sort. All this money is changing hands ...
but in the end we're not becoming any more productive or creative,''
said Moore. ``Until Washington takes action, though, I imagine any
company is up for grabs.
   Under this scenario, share prices of these future targets and
others could be driven up even further.
   And as more and more companies are bought and taken private that
will mean less stock available to the public, which also could boost
prices.
   According to Federal Reserve figures, the amount of available
stock has shrunk by about $75 billion in each of the past two years.
Moore predicts that by the end of this year another $100 billion in
equity will be gone, or about 3 percent of the $3.3 trillion
outstanding.
   So, where will all this money be reinvested?
   Metz predicted, ``The old conservative investor will probably be
buying Treasury bills and CDs with it. They're still wary after the
1987 crash. Others will buy more stock and look for more profits.''

   The ex-lover of a man accused of beating to death
his illegally adopted daughter testified today that she thought he
had ``godlike powers,'' but she also described how he beat her and
ruptured her spleen.
   Hedda Nussbaum said she had been cut off for years from her
family and friends and spent most of her time in the apartment she
shared with Joel Steinberg, who is on trial for murdering the
6-year-old girl they called their own.
   The prosecution and Nussbaum's lawyer have maintained that she
was intimidated and virtually brainwashed by Steinberg, who
frequently beat her.
   ``I was extremely attached to him. I thought he was the most
wonderful person I'd ever met and basically I worshipped him,
literally. (I) thought he had supernatural powers ... and healing
and a lot of godlike powers,'' she testified, adding that she has
come to realize through therapy that this is not true.
   ``Joel basically was acting as my therapist. ... I was very shy
and I guess tense and he was trying to make me more spontaneous,
more natural, freer,'' she sa

   Here is a message from President Reagan on the
Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, which begins Sunday, as released by the
White House Friday:
   I am pleased to send holiday greetings to the Jewish community
during this season of Hanukkah 5749.
   Of the many messages found in the Hanukkah story, the one that
has always inspired me most is this: with a strong faith in the
Almighty, nothing is impossible; and without the help of our
Creator, we labor in vain.
   When the Maccabees vanquished the Syrians and recaptured the Holy
Temple, they found only a small portion of the pure oil needed to
light the Menorah and rededicate the sacred place. Men of less faith
would have despaired, but the leaders of that time knew that trust
in the Almighty would see them through. Their determination was, of
course, rewarded; and today, many centuries later, the miracle of
the lights is celebrated with undiminished wonder, thanks and joy.
   This is the last occasion I will have as president to send warm
wishes to the Jewish people on a holiday. It is my hope that this
festival will renew and strengthen the spirit of Jewish families
everywhere, just as it lifts the hearts of all who look to the care
and mercy of our eternal Father. May he bless you and grant you his
abiding peace.

   Five Cubans with criminal records left
the United States today for their homeland in the first deportation
of Mariel boat people since Cuban prisoners rioted last year to
protest an agreement to return them to Cuba.
   A U.S. Marshal's Service airplane, carrying about 50 people, took
off from the Birmingham airport at 10:55 a.m. Security was tight,
with the five Cubans, shackled in handcuffs and guarded by armed
agents, led one by one to the plane.
   They earlier had been taken to the airport from the federal
prison at Talladega, where they had been held pending a final ruling
on deportation.
   The flight had been scheduled for Thursday, but was delayed when
Cuba asked for more time to prepare to receive the five, three of
whom lost a series of court fights in their effort to avoid going
home.
   The Supreme Court, by a vote of 8-1, today cleared the way for
the deportations. Justice Thurgood Marshall was the lone vote to
grant an emergency request by the three to remain in America. There
was no other comment by the justices.
   On Thursday, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy denied
without comment an emergency application from the three for a stay
of repatriation. The day before, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court in
Atlanta also had rejected their plea.
   The other two Cubans ticketed for the return flight did not
oppose deportation.
   U.S. District Judge U.W. Clemon earlier in the week rejected an
appeal by the three that he overturn their deportation. Clemon is
expected to rule in the next few days in the cases of 10 others, who
also have been held at the Federal Correctional Institution at
Talladega, 60 miles east of Birmingham.
   The 15 were among 114 of the Cubans placed at Talladega after the
prison riots.
   Last year's uprising by Cuban prisoners at federal lockups in
Atlanta and Oakdale, La., was sparked by an agreement for some of
the 1980 Mariel boatlift people to be returned to Cuba.
   In 1980, 125,000 people, some of them convicts or mentally ill,
sailed illegally from Mariel, Cuba, to this country.
   The Justice Department began a repatriation program in 1984, and
sent back 201 Cubans before Cuban President Fidel Castro stopped the
effort in 1985.
   Last year he agreed to accept 2,746 Cuba natives, with the prison
riots coming on the heels of that agreement.
   The United States wants to return as many as 2,500 Marielitos
either as ``excludable aliens'' or those convicted of serious crimes
in this country. Attorneys for the inmates claim they will be
persecuted if sent home.
   The three who were turned down by the courts this week are Miguel
Beitia-Socarraz, 28, who pleaded guilty to second-degree burglary;
Onel Calzado-Garlobo, 43, convicted in 1982 of attempted sexual
assault charges involving a 13-year-old girl; and Rene Maurin-Oliva,
25, who pleaded guilty to theft and battery.

   Federal health officials have reported the first
confirmed influenza cases of the 1988-89 flu season, in Ohio,
Arizona, Hawaii, Michigan and Texas.
   The flu season in the United States occurs during the
cold-weather months, and the first official outbreak of the 1988-89
season was reported in Ohio, the national Centers for Disease
Control said Thursday.
   On Nov. 14, an outbreak of flu-like illness was reported to Ohio
health officials by two schools in the same district. Type B flu
virus _ one of three major influenza groups _ was found in tests on
a teacher and four students.
   The CDC also reported six sporadic cases of type B flu in
children in Texas, beginning with a child in Houston on Oct. 11.
Type B flu also has been found in children in Arizona and Michigan.
   Type A flu cases have been reported in cases in Maryland and
Hawaii; officials do not know which of the two major A types those
cases were.

<HEAD>Salvadoran President Hospitalized in Poor Health</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte of El Salvador,
who is suffering from terminal liver cancer, was hospitalized in
stable condition in Mexico City today, Salvadoran officials said.
   Salvadoran Foreign Minsiter Ricardo Acevedo Peralta told The
Associated Press that Duarte was ``in a government hospital.''
   Embassy Minister Guillermo Rubio said that Duarte, in Mexico City
for the inauguration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, was
being treated for a high temperature. Duarte was in stable condition
and had not changed his plans to return to El Salvador on Saturday
as scheduled, Rubio said.
   Peralta said Duarte ``was somewhat ill, he has a temperature, but
in general terms he is all right.
   ``He only has a little temperature, but these are the normal
results of chemotherapy ... He's a bit tired and the altitude
probably affected him.''
   But government sources in El Salvador said the 63-year-old Duarte
was in ``very grave'' condition today.
   An operator at the Mexico City hotel where Duarte had been
staying said she was under orders not to transfer any press calls to
the Salvadoran delegation.
   Duarte attended Salinas' inauguration Thursday morning, but did
not attend a dinner the new president hosted for visiting Latin
American leaders.
   Duarte had until Thursday exhibited in the past two months what
doctors called remarkable improvement in his health. They said the
spread of the cancer in his liver had been arrested and that other
organs had not been affected.
   When he arrived in Mexico City on Wednesday, he went directly
from the airport to the Basilica of Guadalupe, the holiest shrine
for this country's predominant Roman Catholic population.
   He told reporters he had thanked the Virgen of Guadalupe, to whom
the basilica is dedicated, for a recent improvement in health.
   Since diagnosis of his cancer in early June, Duarte had undergone
two weeklong treatments of chemotherapy in Walter Reed Hospital in
Washington and follow-up applications in San Salvador.
   Doctors had said that, though the liver cancer had been arrested,
it will eventually kill Duarte. In June, they gave him six-18 months
to live.
   Duarte, one of the the United States' staunchest allies in
Central America, assumed power in June 1984. His presidential term
ends next year; elections are due in March 1989.
   He began his political career in 1960 and was a founder of the
Salvadoran Democratic Christian Party.

<HEAD>Penny-Stock Broker Implicated In Alleged Fraud</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The penny-stock brokerage firm Blinder, Robinson &
Co. and its founder have been implicated in an alleged stock fraud
and international money-laundering scheme, according to court
documents.
   The operation allegedly poured thousands of dollars into penny
stocks without reporting the source of the money to federal
authorities as required by law, Internal Revenue Service agents in
Las Vegas, Nev., have testified.
   The funds were funneled through phony investors and shell
companies with no assets to inside investors of penny-stock firms,
according to allegations in the documents.
   The operation reached across the United States to Switzerland and
other European countries, according to a court affidavit submitted
by IRS agent Bob Salisbury.
   The allegations were outlined in more than 300 pages of documents
made public Thursday. The documents, originally sealed by a court
order, were unsealed after The Denver Post filed suit in U.S.
District Court.
   Federal authorities agreed Thursday to release the documents.
Blinder, Robinson, which has offices nationwide, fought the release
and refused repeated requests to comment on the material.
   ``We wanted it sealed to give us a chance to review what is in
there,'' said Alan Jacobson, an attorney for Blinder, Robinson. ``If
there is to be a trial, it should be in a court of law and not in
the media.''
   The government's allegations were the basis of a four-day search
by federal agents beginning Nov. 19 in which virtually all of
Blinder, Robinson's books and records were seized from its
headquarters in Englewood.
   According to the court documents, the main targets of the IRS and
Securities and Exchange Commission investigation are Michael D.
Wright of Salt Lake City and Arnold Kimmes of Palm Springs, Calif.
   Beginning in 1985, the two formed ``shell companies,'' with no
known assets, and sold the stock to ``straw parties'' _ people who
allowed Wright and Kimmes to use their names in transactions
although they had no control over the stock, the documents alleged.
The proceeds from the sales were shipped to Switzerland and other
European countries.
   The affidavit states that Meyer Blinder, who founded Blinder,
Robinson, and his brother, Morris, are under investigation for
aiding and abetting securities fraud.
   Blinder, Robinson, whose revenues have dropped 50 percent this
year, has begun closing some of its 80 U.S. branches. Its parent
company, Blinder International Enterprises Inc., reported revenue of
$139 million last year.

<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo's plan to restore
credibility in his administration by revamping his Cabinet and party
has snagged in the selection process, officials said Friday.
   In other developments, the opposition-controlled National
Assembly issued a subpoena Friday ordering former President Chun
Doo-hwan to testify for parliamentary inquiries into corruption and
irregularities. It was not known if Chun received it.
   Hundreds of protesters again took to the streets demanding
punishment of Chun, who apologized for corruption and repression
during his government and went into self-imposed internal exile.
   Officials in the governing Democratic Justice Party said Roh
plans to replace several dozen key leaders as quickly as possible in
what they say would be the most extensive shake-up since he took
office in February.
   Roh has promised to remove the vestiges of the Chun government to
help soothe public furor over his repressive rule.
   But one party source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Roh was having trouble finding ``fresh and competent faces'' without
military background or past service in the Chun government.
   The president has a limited pool of senior party officials able
to take on the responsibilities of a high ranking government job,
the sources said.
   Party infighting has also delayed the new appointments, which
originally were to be announced this week, sources said.
   Among the most significant Cabinet changes would be the
replacement of incumbent officials who have military backgrounds
with competent civilians.
   Past authoritarian governments have been dominated by former army
generals. Opposition parties have persistently demanded civilian
control of the government.
   Chun, who resigned in February, went into rural exile Nov. 23
after publicly apologizing for corruption, human rights violations
and other abuses during his seven years in office.
   Chun has denied any personal wrongdoing, but a dozen of his
associates and family members, including two brothers, have been
convicted or charged with taking bribes and embezzling government
funds.
   Roh has asked the nation to forgive Chun and promised speedy
democratic reforms, which include the govenment shake-up. But Roh's
proposals failed to satisfy dissidents and radical students who have
staged demonstrations demanding Chun's arrest and punishment.
   On Friday about 200 students armed with iron rods and firebombs
attacked a building of goverment prosecutors, demanding Chun's
arrest. The attack caused no injuries but shattered dozens of
windows.
   Clashes also broke out in Seoul at Yonsei and Seoul National
Universities between hundreds of students and riot police. Students
hurled scores of firebombs, shouting ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan, Punish
Roh Tae-woo!'' No injuries were reported.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci
said Friday a new push to get NATO allies to shoulder more of the
defense burden should stall any efforts in Congress to withdraw
American troops from Western Europe.
   He praised defense ministers at a two-day meeting of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization for taking the ``remarkable step'' of
approving a report critical of some for not doing more for the
Western alliance.
   ``They unanimously approved a report that makes clear that some
of their nations are not bearing a fair share of the common defense
burden,'' Carlucci told a news conference.
   The 79-page report made public Thursday was NATO's effort to
defuse the potentially divisive issue of ``burden-sharing.''
   U.S. congressional critics contend the allies are not pulling
their weight in NATO. Some have raised the possibility the United
States might withdraw some of its 326,000 troops stationed in Europe.
   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner, a former West German
defense minister, told reporters the study sent a signal that ``this
is not a matter of the United States versus the rest of the
alliance. This is a joint alliance effort.''
   Carlucci said the work must continue. ``As long as Cognress
perceives we are dealing with this issue fairly, there will not be
efforts per se to reduce our troop strength in Europe,'' he said.
   ``We must remember we are not in Europe as a philanthropic
gesture to the Europeans,'' he said. ``We are there because of our
collective security.''
   Carlucci also said his recommendation for a 2 percent increase,
after adjustment for inflation, in the 1990 U.S. defense budget
would allow for U.S. troops to remain in Europe.
   If Congress pressed for zero-growth budgets for the Pentagon, he
said, $116 billion would have to be sliced from spending over five
years.
   In a final statement, the ministers said they were encouraged by
signs of change in the Soviet Union since they could lead to
``improved and progressively more stable East-West relations.''
   But the ministers's statement added: ``We have, as yet, seen no
evidence of relaxation in the scale of the Soviet Union's military
effort.''
   Moscow, it said, earmarks about 15 percent to 17 percent of its
total economic output for defense spending, nearly three times the
U.S. level.
   The ministers also said they agreed to provide additional money
in the 1991 and 1992 NATO budgets to relocate the United States'
401st Tactical Fighter Wing from Spain to Italy. The move is
expected to cost about $800 million.
   Spain has said the 72 F-16 fighter jets must leave its territory
by 1991 as part of a drive to reduce the U.S. military presence
there.
   Ministers from 15 of NATO's 16 member nations met at headquarters
in Brussels as part of the Defense Planning Committee. France does
not belong to the committee.
   Foreign ministers from all 16 nations gather in Brussels late
next week for a regularly scheduled meeting.

   West Germany has banned the son of the
late Shah of Iran from addressing a weekend rally of Iranian exiles,
a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Friday.
   The ban comes at time of increased political and business
contacts between West Germany and Iran's revolutionary government.
   The shah's son, Reza Pahlavi, was banned from entering West
Germany in May 1987 and that the ban was still in force, said
spokesman Hanns-Heinrich Schumacher.
   Reza Pahlavi, who lives in the United States, planned to address
a meeting of 4,000 Iranian exiles in Cologne on Sunday.
   Reza Pahlavi's father, Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, died in exile
after being overthrown in 1979.
   West Germany and Iran have stepped up contacts to promote
bilateral business and political ties.

throw bombs at each other; we sit down with each other.''
   After arriving in Washington this morning, the Massachusetts
governor headed immediately to the Capitol for separate meetings
with House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas and new Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell of Maine.
   Wright said the Democratic Party was proud of Dukakis. ``He
fought a good fight,'' the speaker said, adding that the party still
considered Dukakis among its leaders.
   ``He's young. He's vigorous. He has a lot to offer the country,''
Wright told reporters before a private meeting with Dukakis. ``His
future is not behind him, it is ahead of him.''
   The governor thanked Wright but added: ``I think in the long run
I'll probably emerge stronger but I'd be less than candid if I
didn't say I wish I was here in another capacity.''
   Mitchell, too, referred to Dukakis as ``a national leader of our
party.''
   Asked if he considered himself the party's national leader,
Dukakis smiled and said, ``We have a good, strong Democratic Party
with lots of leaders.''
   During his meeting with Bush, he said, he planned to raise most
of the issues that he spoke about during the campaign.
   ``Education is important; the environment is important; child
care is important, good health care is important. These are the
things we believe in very strongly,'' he said.
   Dukakis dodged a question about whether he would run for national
office again, saying only that he was busy catching up on
gubernatorial duties.
   He also met with Massachusetts Sens. Edward Kennedy and John
Kerry and had lunch with Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, who was the No. 2
man on the defeated Democratic ticket.
   Some leading Democrats have privately _ and occasionally publicly
_ criticized Dukakis and his campaign operation. But Bentsen said he
expected Dukakis to play ``a very major role'' in the party.
   Aides said Dukakis also would meet briefly with Washington-based
campaign aides to thank them for their help.
   Dukakis said he hoped to discuss a broad range of issues with
Bush in ``a spirit of partnership, cooperation.''
   The meeting of the former presidential rivals, which was
requested by Bush, came a day after the president-elect met with
Mitchell and two days after he had lunch with Jesse Jackson, one of
the men Dukakis bested to win the Democratic nomination.
   Dukakis, at a Thursday news conference in Boston, had little to
say about his meeting with Bush but did say he and other Democrats
stood ready to support any ``real efforts'' by Bush to reduce the
federal budget deficit.
   Since the election Dukakis has expressed concern over reports
quoting Bush transition aides as saying Medicare and other
entitlement programs could face spending cuts as part of a
deficit-reduction plan.

<HEAD>Official Press Credits Walesa with Conciliatory Tone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party newspaper on Friday
gave Lech Walesa credit for being conciliatory during his TV debate
with an official union leader, but it said the Solidarity leader
usually takes a different tone.
   The 43-minute debate Wednesday night with official unions' chief
Alfred Miodowicz was the first time Walesa had appeared on Polish
television in five years, and the first time he was ever given such
a forum to discuss his views at length.
   Supporters believed Walesa took the offensive and won the debate
easily, but the official press continued to avoid any judgments on
who was the victor.
   Miodowicz, in an interview published Friday with the Flag of
Youth newspaper, said in answer to a question about why he did not
speak more aggressively that, ``The idea of this meeting was to get
closer, not confrontation. As the host, I felt obliged to make my
style of the debate conform to this.''
   ``We did not indulge in a verbal fight which would bring disgrace
on ourselves,'' he said. ``What matters in the end is the future of
Polish trade unions and not who won more points.''
   He also said he would support a proposal made by Walesa during
the debate for further televised debates between experts on various
problems from both the official unions and representatives of
opposing viewpoints.
   ``I propose twice a month discussions about the problems of
workers,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, the party newspaper Trybuna Ludu said the fact that
the debate could be televised in itself proved that authorities are
not ``marking time'' in making reforms.
   ``One should note with appreciation and even satisfaction that
Walesa's address contained several statements and theses in a
conciliatory tone,'' said a Trybuna Ludu political commentator.
   ``By rejecting anarchy or destruction and stating that the
territory of an enterprise should not be an arena for political
struggle, Lech Walesa presented himself in a different way that in
other times,'' said commentator Ryszard Drecki.
   ``Millions of Poles on Wednesday listened to a Lech Walesa who
was rather conciliatory, calm and leaning toward agreement. Not many
people know however the speech he delivered last Sunday, an address
unequivocally confrontational. Did some change occur in his views in
three days?''
   The official press had criticized hostile remarks attacking
Miodowicz allegedly made by Walesa on Sunday, but Walesa has denied
making the quoted statements. The official PAP news agency later
conceded some of its quotations of Walesa were erroneous, and issued
a retraction.

   A $34 million contract to build a new

   Omitted from the contract was $1.5 million for 195 electronic
sliding glass cell doors and other furnishings, city officials said
Thursday.
   ``It sounds to me like we're buying a car without the two front

   Michael Berg, sheriff's director of jails and prisons, said the
cell doors would be purchased out of a $2 million contingency fund
established to pay for cost overruns.

   Nils Bejerot, an international authority
on drugs in society, has died at the age of 67.
   Bejerot, who died Tuesday, suffered for several months apparently
from tuberculosis.
   His health deteriorated following two arson attempts on his home
in Stockholm last summer, said Jonas Hertelius, an official at the
Swedish Carnegie Institute, a private group headed by Bejerot that
specialized in drug research.
   No one was injured in the attacks but Bejerot's large private
library and documents were destroyed and he was disturbed by the
incidents.
   Bejerot wrote books on drug abuse and criminal policy.
   He maintained that the West's drug problem was created by the
permissive drug policies in the 1960s. He attacked anti-drug
programs that he believed failed to force addicts and to take
responsibilities in society, lashing out at what he called ``lenient
psychologists.''
   Several governments sought his advice on drug issues. In 1974 he
was called as an expert in U.S. Senate hearings about hashish and
marijuana.
   He lectured earlier this year in the Soviet Union on drugs. He
was also was a main speaker at an Atlanta seminar arranged by the
Parent Institute for Drug Education.
   Services will be held Dec. 10 in Stockholm.

   A man who stabbed his heroin-addict son
to death was acquitted of murder and manslaughter Friday.
   A jury took 40 minutes to find John Albertina innocent in the
killing of his 21-year-old son, Stephen, on March 11.
   Albertina, 51, hugged weeping family members at the end of the
three-day trial.
   He told the court he acted in self-defense after his son came at
him with a wrench during a family fight.
   Since becoming a heroin addict, the youth sometimes attacked his
family. He broke a sister's jaw, broke another sister's fingers and
was arrested for threatening to kill them, the court heard.
   On the night of his death, he flew into a rage after his father
told him, ``I don't hate you, I despise you.'' The young man was
stabbed as he and his father wrestled.

   The government announced Friday it
will ask Argentina to extradite a former Nazi sentenced to death for

   Justice Minister Frits Korthals Altes' announcement followed
disclosures by Haarlems Dagblad newspaper in October that two of its
reporters had located Abraham Kipp in Buenos Aires.
   Kipp fled to Argentina after the war and became a naturalized
citizen in 1953.
   In his absence, he was sentenced to death for promoting arrests
of dozens of Dutch Jews during the 1940-45 Nazi occupation.
   Most of his victims were deported to death camps and never
returned.
   Holland has asked Argentine police to arrest Kipp and will ask
for his extradition, said Korthals Altes.
   Since the newspaper report, Kipp reportedly has been in hiding.

   Planned drastic cuts in West Germany's
large military maneuvers won't affect the country's battle
readiness, officials at a meeting of NATO defense ministers said
Friday.
   West Germany will abandon more than half its maneuvers involving
more than 2,000 troops, but increase smaller excercises to allay
environmental and public complaints, said West German Defense
Minister Rupert Scholz. The switch also would be more
cost-effective, he said.
   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner said Scholz stressed the
impending reliance on smaller excercises ``was meant to increase the
effectiveness'' of West German forces.
   ``It was not described as a reduction in overall military
excercises,'' said Woerner.
   Scholz said allies had ``reacted positively'' when hee, won't be affected.
But observers said large disruptive
maneuvers by other NATO troops might be seen in an increasingly bad
light.

   A firebomb exploded at the Turkish

police said.
   Nobody was hurt in the attack by activists who left a banner
protesting alleged human rights abuses in Turkish prisons, according
to police spokesman Hans den Breejen.
   The protesters also sparked a bomb alert by leaving two empty

   Army explosives experts evacuated several buildings but found the
cans were harmless, the policeman said.
   There were no arrests.
   The incident occurred as a group of Turkish and Dutch activists
go into the sixth day of a hunger strike to protest conditions in
Turkish jails, according to the Rev. Hans Visser, pastor of the

   None of the 25 to 30 people at the church was involved in the

<TEXT>
   Five armed Soviets who hijacked a busload
of school-children in the Soviet Union and released them in exchange
for a plane out of the country surrendered today after landing in
Israel with a hostage crew.
   The Ilyushin-76 plane landed at Ben-Gurion International Airport
near Tel Aviv at 5:45 p.m. (10:45 a.m. EST). Israel Army radio said
the plane was allowed to land after officials received a request
from the Soviet Union.
   ``It's all over,'' an army spokesman told reporters about 10
minutes after eight people were seen leaving the aircraft. There was
no word on whether the eight crew members who were freed had been
injured during the ordeal.
   Army officials said that shortly after the plane landed, two men
and a woman came out of the plane and asked for a translator. They
then began negotiations in which the hijackers surrendered a gun.
   The standoff ended a short time later.
   State-run Israel radio said the hijackers, who were described as
four Russians and an Armenian with criminal backgrounds, had large
sums of money with them.
   The five had hijacked a school bus with 30 children aboard in the
Soviet Union and traded their hostages for the plane and about 2
million rubles (about $3.3 million) worth of ransom, said Israel's
chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron.
   One of the Soviet crew members, flight engineer Yuri Nikolai
Yermilov, said the five ``wanted to fly out of the Soviet Union.
That's why they kidnapped the bus with the children.''
   Transportation Minister Chaim Korfu told reporters the Soviets
had requested extradition of the hijackers.
   ``We know there are no children aboard,'' Korfu said. ``There are
five hijackers, four men and a woman, and eight crew members.''
   Army radio said there had been constant contacts between Israeli
and Soviet airport officials and some diplomatic contacts as well.
   It said the hijackers had not asked to land specifically in
Israel but only included it on a list of possible destinations.
   Reporters were kept in the terminal building and could only see
the movements of vehicles on the darkened runway once the plane
landed.
   Earlier, radio monitors said that Tel Aviv's control tower had
contacted the hijacked plane. ``Can I talk with the hijacker?'' a
controller asked. ``No,'' the pilot responded.
   Army radio said the plane at first headed toward Pakistan and
Iraq, but then changed course and flew toward Israel.
   In Moscow, an official said the incident began Thursday in the
city of Ordzhonikidze in southern Russia.
   ``A group of armed bandits hijacked a bus with 30 school-children
and a teacher and demanded a plane to deliver them abroad,'' Albert
Vlasov, head of the Soviet news agency Novosti, told a news
conference.
   ``In order to save the children and the teacher a decision was
made to give a plane,'' Vlasov said. He said the hostages were
released unharmed.
   In a later report, the Soviet news agency Tass said the hijackers
included four men and one woman armed with three pistols and an
automatic rifle.
   The hijackers ``demanded a huge sum of money and an airliner for
a flight out of the country,'' Tass said.
   The bus was taken to the airport in Ordzhonikidze, but the
hijackers could not find a big enough plane there so they took the
bus and hostages to neighboring Mineralniye Vodi, where they boarded
the plane, Tass said.
   It was not clear from the report whether the children were taken
onto the aircraft and then released, or whether they were freed as
the hijackers got onto the plane.
   Vlasov said the hijackers wanted to go to Israel, South Africa or
Pakistan. The last reported hijacking in the Soviet Union occurred
in March, when members of a family musical group from Irkutsk in
Siberia hid guns and explosives inside their instruments and seized
an Aeroflot jet en route to Leningrad.
   The plane landed near Leningrad after the pilot said he was
running low on fuel. An army assault team stormed the plane, and the
hijackers opened fire and set off a bomb. Five of the hijackers
died. Three passengers and a flight attendant also were killed.

<HEAD>Agency Says It Destroyed 60 Percent of Marijuana in National
Forests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agents eradicated roughly 60 percent of
the marijuana grown in national forests during 1988, while sharply
increasing the number of cultivation arrests and plant seizures, a
U.S. Forest Service official said Friday.
   At the same time, the number of physical assaults against agents
and members of the public in cases related to marijuana growing was
down, but the number of sites that were booby-trapped were up,
according to Forest Service figures.
   The statistics also indicate that growers now apparently are
concentrating their efforts on more potent forms of marijuana, such
as sinsemilla, and on hybrids that produce more pounds of saleable
marijuana per plant.
   The crackdown on drug growers in the forests has become one of
the agency's top priorities, and agents are armed with increased
enforcement powers and more money than in the past.
   ``In essence, 1988 is the first full year in which we have been
able to see the sucess of our efforts,'' said Ed Few, the Forest
Service's assistant branch chief for law enforcement. ``We now have
policies and strategies in operation to attack this problem.''
   Few said federal agents wiped out an estimated 60 percent of the
marijuana grown in national forests in 1988, compared with an
estimated 40 percent of the crop in 1987.
   He said agents and rangers seized more than 340,000 plants in
1988, compared with 255,000 plants in 1987.
   The estimated street value of the plants seized in 1988 was more
than $1.2 billion, said Few, adding that the Forest Service
considered that a ``conservative estimate.''
   Few said the agency was ``comfortable'' with it estimates, which
are based on intelligence from field agents and surveys of marijuana
plantations that were harvested before being detected.
   ``It would be nice to get 100 percent'' of the crop, Few said,
``but we would be foolish to predict that. The objective is to seize
enough so that is becomes apparent to the grower that it is not
cost-effective for them to use national forest lands.''
   Few said that while once agents used to find plantations with
4,000 or 5,000 plants in a forest clearing, most sites now contain
about 100 plants that are growing near other trees or brush.
   The number of marijuana-growing arrests made by the Forest
Service was up almost 400 percent, from 134 nationwide in 1987 to
527 this year, Few said.
   ``We've dealt with the problem to some extent over the past 10
years handling it as a misdemeanor crime and concentrating on
eradication,'' Few said. ``The 1986 drug act gave us the tools we
needed to do the job.''
   Drug growers now face felony charges and agents now are allowed
to pursue suspects even after they leave federal lands.
   This year also was the first year in which the Forest Service
received the funds for drug enforcement progams it had requested, a
total of $3.2 million, Few said.
   The number of physical assaults on agents or members of the
general public using national forests dropped from 19 in 1987 to 11
in 1988, while the number of sites found with ``potentially lethal''
booby-traps grew from 83 in 1987 to 116 in 1988.
   Few said there was a ``dramatic'' increase in the number of
marijuana plantations found that exclusively contained the more
potent sinsemilla plants, with 1,255 such sites found in 1987 and
2,268 such sites found this year.
   He said the street value of sinsemilla can be almost twice that
of less potent types.

   A homeless man was arrested today for arson,
and police said he was a suspect in at least one of 10 fires that
broke out in an inner-city neighborhood overnight, destroying eight
buildings.
   Tips from witnesses led to the arrest of Booker T. Washington
Jr., 46, who was picked up in the neighborhood while attempting to
drink from a container of gasoline, said police spokeswoman Yvonne
Bechet.
   He was booked with simple arson and taken to Charity Hospital for
observation.
   ``He was one of the city's homeless, living in an abandoned
car,'' said Bechet.
   No one was injured in the fires, which occurred mainly in vacant
residences. A passer-by said he pulled two elderly women from what
was believed to be the only occupied building. Eight buildings were
destroyed, and at least six others were heavily damaged.
   Washington was booked for a one-alarm fire that broke out just
before 8 p.m. Thursday, about the same time most of the city's
firefighters were working on a six-alarm blaze that razed much of a
nearby city block, said Fire Department spokesman Bob Whitman.
   Police and fire officials said Washington may be linked to the
other fires also.
   Fire Superintendent William McCrossen said there was ``no doubt
in my mind'' that the blazes were arson.
   Police said a witness reported seeing a man running with a
gasoline can just as the flames started leaping from the first fire,
which swept through six houses on one street. Two more fires
engulfed an abandoned bar and a vacant house, respectively, and
seven more broke out over the next few hours, all but one within
three or four blocks of the first fires, Whitman said.
   Mark Dandey said he was in a nearby restaurant when some children
told him there were people in one of the burning buildings.
   ``I smelled smoke and I ran out and there were two young kids
saying, `Fire! Fire!' So then, we go over the house and tried to
kick the door down. After I kicked the door down, they had two old
ladies in the house and I pulled them out,'' Dandey said.

   Atlantis and its crew of five
military astronauts rocketed into orbit today on a secret mission
that reportedly will deploy a powerful radar satellite to spy on the
Soviet Union and guide the new stealth bomber.
   The shuttle blasted away from its seaside launch pad at 9:30:34
a.m. EST _ with less than 90 seconds to go in the launch window _
after a blacked-out countdown that was delayed by the same weather
worries that had forced a postponement on Thursday.
   The spaceship etched a fiery path in the sky as it headed
straight up on a northward path _ a course that will allow the $500
million satellite it releases to fly over 80 percent of the Soviet
Union on its intelligence-gathering mission.
   ``A very clean ascent for Atlantis; there were no problems
encountered on the way to orbit,'' said Brian Welch, the commentator
at Mission Control in Houston.
   An hour later, Welch reported ``the vehicle is in very clean
shape. There are no systems problems whatever to report.''
   With those words, the Defense Department clamped a security lid
on the flight, cutting off the normal NASA commentary on the mission
and the broadcast of crew-to-ground conversations.
   Only two further announcements were planned during the flight.
The first, about four hours after launch, was a brief report that
``the crew of Atlantis is go for orbit operations. All crew members
are doing well and all systems of the orbiter are performing
satisfactorily.''
   The second announcement will be an alert that Atlantis will land
exactly 24 hours later at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. The flight
is expected to last three or four days.
   Air Force Secretary Edward C. Aldridge, who observed the liftoff
from the control center, thanked the launch team, saying ``the
payload was extremely important and you did a great job all around.''
   Added NASA Administrator James C. Fletcher: ``You gave us some
heart failure there toward the end, but we got it off ... my thanks
for another great job.''
   Atlantis' liftoff on the 27th shuttle flight and the third
all-military mission was witnessed by a smaller-than-usual crowd of
a few thousand space enthusiasts along nearby rivers and roadsides.
   The launch had been delayed 24 hours by strong winds along the
shuttle's flight path. Strong, shifting winds five miles up also
threatened today's liftoff, but weather balloon data read late in
the countdown showed they were acceptable.
   New doubts cropped up even at the 31-second mark, when NASA again
stopped the clock briefly because of concern about weather at a
trans-Atlantic landing site in Spain.
   NASA had said the launch could occur in a period starting at 6:32
a.m. and ending at 9:32 a.m.
   Two minutes, eight seconds after liftoff, the flight passed a
critical milestone when the two solid fuel booster rockets burned
out and jettisoned on schedule, falling into the Atlantic Ocean.
   The failure of a booster rocket joint led to the destruction of
Challenger and loss of its seven-person crew on Jan. 28, 1986.
   With the boosters gone, Atlantis' three liquid-fuel main engines
burned for an additional 6{ minutes and propelled the ship into an
orbit more than 100 miles high.
   The astronauts, who boarded the spacecraft about 5 a.m., spent 4{
hours lying on their backs in their bulky escape suits awaiting the
decision that finally sent them aloft.
   Air Force meteorologists were watching an area between 25,000
feet and 28,000 feet where there were shear winds of varying speeds
and directions that could break up the shuttle as it roared upward
toward orbit.
   ``The speed of the wind is not as much a factor as their
direction and the shuttle's direction of flight,'' NASA commentator
Hugh Harris said.
   The fueling of Atlantis was halted for about an hour at 12:30
a.m. while a minor leak was fixed on an oxygen tank on a ``fuel
farm'' near the pad.
   Had today's launch been postponed, NASA would probably have
waited until Sunday to try again. Policy forbids putting work crews
through the grueling launch schedule three days in a row.
   The crew commander, Navy Cmdr. Robert L. Gibson, is no stranger
to launch postponements. As commander of Columbia on the 24th
shuttle mission in 1986, he experienced a record seven postponements
and had to board the ship six times before finally lifting off.
   The other crew members are Air Force Lt. Col. Guy S. Gardner, the
pilot; Col. Richard M. Mullane and Lt. Col. Jerry L. Ross of the Air
Force, and Navy Cmdr. William M. Shepherd.
   Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity say the crew will
release a giant 18-ton satellite named Lacrosse that is capable of
gathering extremely sharp radar images of military targets in the
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   The information should help U.S. intelligence officials verify
Soviet compliance with arms control treaties and serve as a ``radar
eye'' for the new B2 stealth bomber, the sources said.
   Defense officials contend the secrecy is necessary to make it
more difficult for Soviet satellites and spy ships off the Florida
coast to monitor the flight and learn its purpose.
   However, the Soviets, have indicated through the official news
agency Tass thrst post-Challenger
flight.

   George Bush shook hands with defeated
Democratic rival Michael Dukakis today as the Massachusetts governor
arrived for a private fence-mending session that the president-elect
had suggested.
   Bush and Dukakis had no words for the throng of reporters on hand
before going into the vice president's residence at the Naval
Observatory. A minute later, Sen. Dan Quayle, the future occupant of
the house, emerged and left in his limousine, presumably after
greeting Dukakis inside.
   Earlier, Bush warmly greeted onetime Republican rival Pat
Robertson at the White House, hailing the way ex-political foes can
be post-election friends and accepting Robertson's praise for
Cabinet appointments so far.
   Bush turned aside questions about further appointments in a less
cheerful manner, criticizing ``early, premature needless
speculation.''
   He also met with John Swan, the premier of Bermuda, and was to
meet this evening with another foreign leader, Argentine President
Raul Alfonsin, in whose country military units were reported to have
mutinied today at a large army base outside the capital of Buenos
Aires.
   Swan and Alfonsin are the fourth and fifth heads of state meeting
with Bush since his election Nov. 8.
   At the White House, Robertson told reporters he gave Bush a
private message from the foreign minister of South Africa.
   ``The time has come to recognize that the South African
government needs a little encouragement,'' said Robertson, who
returned last week from South Africa. He is a longtime critic of
sanctions against that nation's white-ruled apartheid government.
   Robertson said Bush told him he would like to see Jesse Jackson
and other American black leaders visit South Africa ``and explore
firsthand what's happening because there have been some significant
changes over the last 10 years.''
   Robertson cited the government's movement of Nelson Mandela from
prison to a halfway house, the commutation of the death sentences of
the Sharpeville 6 and other steps. ``They have broken down a great
deal of institutionalized and social apartheid and I think it would
be nice to just say, `You're on the right track and we'd like to
encourage you a little bit,'' Robertson said.
   Bush, who was not available to reporters after the Robertson
meeting, also was hosting 20 evangelical leaders at his home Friday
night.
   Before the meeting with Robertson, Bush was asked if he had a
place in his Cabinet for the television evangelist. ``Just good
friend,'' Robertson interjected.
   ``Some people don't understand the campaign,'' Bush said. ``They
think that when you run against someone in a campaign that that
injures friendship. ... It's wonderful the way the American politcal
system works.''
   Robertson told Bush that in the transition period he had ``played
it as well as you possibly could. ... I think it's an
extraordinarily competent Cabinet so far.''
   Bush declined to say when he would appoint his defense secretary
or other top officials. ``The more I answer your questions on the
subject that needs to be treated in an orderly, procedural fashion,
the more I add to that which I don't like which is a lot of early,
premature, needless speculation, and so I'm not going to do it,''
Bush told reporters.
   ``We are way ahead of where other presidents-elect have been and
I'm going to stay ahead. And so all I say is stay tuned and please
don't press me,'' said Bush.
   He paid tribute to retiring Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, another
erstwhile rival, at a dinner Thursday night.
   Bush, who reviled Dukakis during the campaign as ``another
liberal governor coming out of nowhere who will take us back to the
bad old days,'' made clear immediately after the election that he
hoped to bury the hatchet as quickly as possible.
   Dukakis, for his part, had spoken during the campaign of sleaze
among top Reagan administration officials, drawing strong retorts
from Bush after saying, ``There's an old Greek saying ... `The fish
rots from the head first.'''
   Steve Crawford, a Dukakis spokesman, said the Massachusetts
governor planned to raise with Bush a number of the issues he
campaigned on.
   ``Education, health care, day care, drugs, housing and other
issues that he felt were important during the campaign and still
feels are important,'' Crawford said.
   In a meeting Thursday, Bush told Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, that he will take the lead in proposing a
solution to the budget deficit, as Democrats have insisted.
   ``That is exactly what I intend to do'' after Jan. 20, Bush said.
   Bush also said he won't be rushed into making Cabinet
appointments despite persistent news media speculation that may be
troubling to prospects such as John Tower, the former Texas senator
keeping a long vigil for the Pentagon opening.

   Iranian President Ali Khamenei said Friday
the country's constitution needs to be changed to clear up
ambiguities, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   ``The first chapters of the constitution concerning basic rights

administrative organization, be it the executive or the judiciary,
there are some problems and ambiguities that will be corrected one
day,'' IRNA quoted Khamenei as saying.
   Khamenei said the lack of a clear policy-making body was a
defect, according to the report, monitored in Nicosia.

<HEAD>Little Bit of Pesticide Residue Not Hazardous, FDA Chief Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pesticide residues in food do not pose a health
hazard, even though more than 3 percent of the food tested by the
government had illegal amounts or types of pesticides, the Food and
Drug Administration said Friday.
   ``Many seem to believe that we are consuming large and harmful
amounts of pesticide residues,'' FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young
said in a statement. ``That's a myth, and another myth is that any
residue, no matter how little or how legal is harmful.''
   However, a report by the Agriculture Department's Office of
Inspector General said the government system to assure that meat is
free of dangerous chemicals has broken down.
   Predictable inspections and ineffective follow-up methods hamper
federal efforts to detect chemical contamination, trace it back to
its source and determine if violations are continuing, acording to
the report, a copy of which was obtained by the Des Moines Register.
   The FDA said Friday that less than 1 percent of the fresh foods
tested show more pesticides than allowed by federal guidelines. An
additional 3 percent had illegal pesticide residues, which the
agency called ``technical violations, such as an otherwise approved
pesticide residue being found on the `wrong' crop.''
   ``The actual residues found are almost always much lower than the
tolerances allow,'' Young said. ``Furthermore, residues usually will
disappear or decrease during processing, washing and cooking.''

   The nation's civilian unemployment rate in November edged upward
from a 14-year low to 5.4 percent despite an increase of 463,000 new
jobs and a record percentage of the population at work. The 0.1
percentage point increase from October's rate of 5.3 percent was due
almost entirely to a 560,000 increase in the civilian labor force _
people holding jobs or looking for them.
   Despite the slight increase in the unemployment rate, 116 million
Americans held jobs last month, or 62.6 percent of the adult
population age 16 or over.

September, revised up from a previous estimate of minus 7.8 percent
and a gain of 2.1 percent in August.
   Sales for the first 10 months of 1988 are 0.4 percent higher than

   `Tis is better to give than to receive,
especially if what you give is a fruitcake.
   An American Express survey about Christmas gifts found that the
fruitcake was chosen most often from a list of ``worst'' holiday
gifts.
   It even finished ahead of ``no gift at all,'' the second choice.
Fruitcake was picked as the worst gift by 31 percent, ``no gift'' by
18 percent.
   Anything that has to be assembled was third on the list of bad
ideas, followed by damaged gifts, another tie or blouse, and a gift
that needs batteries but doesn't come with them.
   The same survey asked people what they would do with a bad gift.
Thirty percent said they would hide it in the closet, 21 percent
said they would return it, and 19 percent said they would give it
away.
   Nine percent specified they would give it to someone else as a
gift, suggesting the Christmas fruitcake might get recycled as a
gift for the host of a New Year's party.
   The survey was conducted this fall By R.H. Bruskin Associates,
which questioned 1,000 men and women nationwide, age 18 or older.

   The decision by Soviet authorities to permit armed
hijackers to fly out of the country Friday marked a sharp reversal
from the two previous known air piracies, both of which ended in
fatal shootouts.
   But the Foreign Ministry's statement that the decision was made
``to save the children'' was consistent with Soviet tradition and
policy that focuses considerable official attention on the care and
upbringing of the nation's young.
   The five hijackers seized a busload of children in the city of
Ordzhonikidze in southern Russia, then traded the hostages for a
plane out of the country. They surrendered after landing in Israel
with a hostage crew of eight.
   Before Mikhail S. Gorbachev rose to power in March 1985,
incidents such as hijackings rarely were mentioned by the tightly
controlled official press.
   The labor newspaper Trud reported in July that there have been
more than 50 attempted hijackings in the Soviet Union in the past 15
years. Few of them were reported by the Soviet media.
   In March, an 11-member family musical troupe from Siberia seized
an Aeroflot jet in March with 76 passengers aboard over the Urals
and demanded to be flown to London. According to published reports,
authorities ordered the plane to land at a small airstrip near
Leningrad, tricking the hijackers into thinking they were landing in
nearby Finland.
   The hijackers shot a stewardess when they realized they had been
duped, the reports said, and after two hours of negotiations, a
police assault team stormed the plane, prompting the hijackers to
detonate a bomb that destroyed the aircraft.
   Nine people, including five of the hijackers, three passengers
and the stewardess, were killed. Nineteen people were seriously
wounded.
   The other reported incident took place Sept. 20, 1986, in the
Ural Mountains city of Ufa, when armed members of the internal
security forces hijacked an airliner. Media reports at the time said
five people, including two hijackers, were killed when authorities
stormed the plane. The other perpetrators were tried and sentenced,
the report said, but few details were provided.
   Air piracy is a capital offense in the Soviet Union.
   In one of the best known cases, Soviet authorities arrested 26
people in connection with an abortive attempt on June 17, 1970, by
11 Soviet Jews to board and hijack an aircraft in Leningrad to fly
to Sweden.
   Several of those arrested were refuseniks, or Jews who have been
refused permission to emigrate. The 26 were convicted in four
separate trials. Two were sentenced to death, with their sentences
later commuted, and the rest received lengthy prison terms.
   The same year two Soviet planes were hijacked to Turkey in
separate incidents. In 1977, two were commandeered and forced to fly
to Sweden.
   Four unsuccessful attempts to hijack Soviet airliners were
reported between 1961 and 1966.

   Police answering a report that a man was
holding his girlfriend hostage mistakenly surrounded the house next
door, then shooed the man away when he tried to surrender, police
and witnesses said.
   ``I didn't know what was coming down,'' said the man, Jessie
Cobb, 37. ``I came out and they started cussing me and told me to go
back inside. I thought they were going to pull a `Rambo' on me.''
   Both he and his girlfriend, Joyce Gaines, said later that the
incident was an argument that had been blown out of proportion. She
denied that she told police by telephone that Cobb had a knife, as
police said later.
   No arrests were made.
   Police were called to the house Wednesday by a neighbor who said
Cobb was holding Ms. Gaines there against her will.
   But because of a mixup, the police Special Operations Team
surrounded the house next door. When Cobb tried to surrender,
officers frantically waived him back inside, thinking he was just a
curious neighbor and telling him he was in danger.
   Police Sgt. John Bowman said the confusion intensified when Ms.
Gaines told hostage negotiators by telephone that she could hear
officers knocking on the door.
   ``She apparently was hearing the officers' rather heavy-handed
knocking on the house next door, but our negotiators didn't know
that,'' Bowman said.
   A witness, Johnny Walker, said he tried to tell police they were
at the wrong house, but officers told him they knew what they were
doing.
   ``This old boy in the meantime had come out two or three times to
give himself up, and the tactical squad ran him back in the house,
saying he could get hurt,'' Walker said.
   Bowman said officers were embarrassed by the incident, but
officers handled the situation the best way they could with the
information available.
   ``You can armchair quarterback this thing to death. It happened,
and the comic overtones are not unknown to us,'' Bowman said. At any
rate, he said, no one got hurt.

   Soviet troops broke up a mob of up to 1,500 people
that had gathered in the Azerbaijan capital of Baku to attack
Armenians, official media reported Friday.
   The Soviet government formed a commission to feed and clothe
thousands of refugees from the republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan
who had crowded into tents, dormitories and relatives' apartments
because of ethnic violence that has killed at least 60 people since
February.
   Baku radio, in a report monitored by the British Broadcasting
Corp. in London, said soldiers had prevented a mob from attacking
Armenian residents of Baku on Thursday night.
   ``In the area of the railway station, a mob of up to 1,500 people
attempted to beat up citizens of Armenian nationality. Because of
the measures adopted, the troops stopped the attempts at hooligan
activities,'' the radio said.
   Soldiers fired warning shots in five instances overnight, and
they confiscated nine guns and two knives, it said.
   A curfew remained in effect in Baku, Yerevan and other major
cities in the two republics.
   At least 80,000 people have crossed the border to their ethnic
homelands, Soviet media reported Thursday. The Defense Ministry
newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda reported Friday that another 19,000 people
had fled across the border the previous day.
   In a report from northern Armenia, the newspaper Socialist
Industry said a resort designed for 300 children and 150 adults was
jammed with 700 people who had fled Azerbaijan.
   ``In tents intended for two people, there are six beds,'' the
newspaper said. ``In corridors, halls and entrances, endlessly tired
people sit silently, immersed in themselves.''
   ``Dozens of people who we listened to here said the same thing:
there, where they lived, local authorities warned that they could
not answer for their safety, and proposed that they urgently leave
the republic.''
   ``There was no talk about compensation for their homes, cattle,
furniture or belongings,'' the paper said.
   The Tass news agency said that Boris Shcherbina, deputy premier,
would head a Soviet government commission to extend aid to the
refugees. Scherbina also headed a special commission 2{ years ago to
deal with the Chernobyl nuclear power accident.
   Refugees ``will be provided with food, housing, medical and other
social and consumer services, and given jobs,'' Tass said.
   Armenia and Azerbaijan previously had set up such commissions on
a local level. Official Armenian media have said that the government
is confiscating empty homes to house the refugees and is providing
food for them.
   The two southern Soviet republics are locked in a bitter dispute
over control of the predominantly Armenian region of
Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan. Residents began agitating in
February for annexation by Armenia, but the idea has been rejected
both by Azerbaijan and the central government in Moscow.
   Ethnic rioting broke out in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait at
the end of February, and 32 people died.
   The republics remained tense since then, and in mid-November
Azerbaijanis began mass demonstrations to protest what they said was
an Armenian effort to send settlers to Nagorno-Karabakh to pad the
Armenian majority.
   A national Interior Ministry spokesman told the Communist Party
newspaper Pravda in an article published Thursday that the death
toll in the latest violence was 28.
   The Supreme Soviet parliament and the Soviet leadership under
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev appealed for calm Thursday, urging
Armenians and Azerbaijanis to show restraint.

<HEAD>Black Editor Banned from Journalism, Anti-Government Action</HEAD>

   The government released a black
newspaper editor Friday after two years of detention without charge,
but it banned him from journalistic or anti-government activity.
   Also on Friday, the government reportedly freed the head of a
banned black educational group, and an anti-apartheid newspaper was
back in print after a four-week ban.
   The newspaper editor, Zwelakhe Sisulu, was the best known of
South Africa's thousands of emergency detainees and there had been
an international campaign urging his release. He is editor of New
Nation, an outspoken anti-apartheid newspaper, and had been a Nieman
Fellow at Harvard.
   ``Amongst other things, I can't go back to the paper,'' were the
only words Sisulu uttered as newsmen swarmed around him outside
Johannesburg Prison in the black township of Diepkloof.
   Later, he appeared briefly at a packed news conference, but was
advised to leave by his attorney, because the restrictions placed on
him bar him from talking to the news media and attending a gathering
of more than 10 people.
   Late Friday, police banned a rally planned Sunday in a Soweto
church to celebrate the freedom of Zeph Mothopeng, the leader of the
outlawed Pan-Africanist Congress who was released from prison Nov.
26 on humanitarian grounds because of his illness. Major leaders
against apartheid, the government's system of racial separation, had
been scheduled to speak.
   Sisulu, 37, rejoins his wife and two young children in the black
township of Soweto outside Johannesburg. Sisulu's attorney,
Priscilla Jana, said he is barred from writing for any publication,
leaving the Johannesburg area, participating in any activity in
which the government is criticized, talking to the news media, or
going to any school.
   He is also required to report to police twice a day and be in his
home at night, Jana said.
   ``This is the harshest (restriction) order so far under the
emergency regulations,'' Jana said. ``It seems he can do virtually
nothing. He is imprisoned in his own house.''
   Lt. Peet Bothma of the Law and Order Ministry said several other
detainees were to be released Friday but gave no details.
   Eric Molobi, national coordinator for the banned National
Education Crisis Committee, was freed, according to his attorney,
Azhar Cachalia. The committee sought to increase black control over
curriculum and policies in black schools.
   Molobi, detained for a year, was placed under restrictions
similar to Sisulu's. He cannot leave his home from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.,
must remain in Johannesburg and is prohibited from participating in
activities of major anti-apartheid organizations, Cachalia said.
   Sisulu's parents are among the country's best-known activists.
His father is Walter Sisulu, a jailed leader of the outlawed African
National Congress and a close colleague of ANC leader Nelson
Mandela, who has been moved from a jail to a hospital to recuperate
from tuberculosis.
   Sisulu's mother, Albertina, a co-president of the banned United
Democratic Front anti-apartheid coalition, is under government
restrictions that prevent her from being quoted or attending
gatherings.
   Sisulu, who will turn 38 on Dec. 17, was hospitalized in June for
treatment of depression.
   The Sisulu family has been awarded the Carter-Menil Human Rights
Prize, but it is expected that only Zwelakhe's exiled older brother
and sister will attend the award ceremony in Atlanta on Dec. 10. He
has another brother and sister in South Africa, and an adopted
brother in prison.
   Since he was detained in December 1986, Sisulu's newspaper,
published by the Southern African Catholic Bishop's Conference, was
banned for three months.
   Another anti-apartheid newspaper, The Weekly Mail, returned to
newsstands Friday after being banned for four weeks as an alleged
``threat to the public.'' It was the third paper that Home Affairs
Minister Stoffel Botha has suspended this year under powers granted
to him under the 29-month-old state of emergency.
   Censorship rules under the emergency ban or restrict reporting
about unrest, security force actions, treatment of detainees, many
forms of peaceful protest and a broad range of statements the
government considers subversive.
   A government official said Friday ``action will be instituted''
against a new Afrikaans-language anti-apartheid weekly, Vrye
Weekblad (Free Weekly), because the newspaper has published for a
month without registering.
   Gerrie van Zyl, director-general of the Department of Home
Affairs, said the action would be taken against the paper ``to
ensure good order.''
   The government had ordered the paper to pay a $13,000 deposit for
a registration certificate.

<HEAD>Southern California's 1988 Smog Ranked 3rd Worst Of Decade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southern Californians just suffered through
one of the worst smog seasons of the decade, air quality officials
said.
   Ozone levels in the South Coast Air Basin surpassed federal
standards on 172 of the 184 days of this past smog season, which
runs from May 1 to Oct. 31. That number was exceeded only twice in
this decade.
   Ozone levels were above federal standards on 180 days in 1981 and
173 days in 1984.
   The smog season is the time of year when Southern California's
temperatures are the hottest and its air the most stagnant, factors
that contribute strongly in the creation of air pollution.
   Ozone is formed in sunlight by the reaction of nitrogen oxides, a
product of combustion, with certain hydrocarbon compounds such as
gasoline vapors and solvents.
   Ozone lowers resistance to infection, exacerbates chronic
respiratory illness and can cause permanent lung damage in people
exposed to high levels over a period of several years.

   New home sales in October jumped to the highest
level since February 1987, the government said Friday, suprising
analysts who have been expecting rising interest rates this year to
dampen sales.
   In a joint release, the departments of Commerce and of Housing
and Urban Development said sales increased to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 733,000 units, the highest level in 20 months.
   Adding to the robust picture, the government sharply revised its
September figure to a 1.4 percent drop, up from the previously
estimated minus 7.8 percent.
   Last year, most economists were expecting 1988 sales to be lower
as interest rates rose. However, sales in the first 10 months of the
year are a slight 0.2 percent higher than the same period last year.
   Fixed-rate mortgages did rise from March through mid-August, but
eased until early November before starting to climb again.
Adjustable-rate mortgages, however, have risen steadily since the
spring and now are nearly as high as before the October 1987 stock
market crash.
   This week, the average rate, excluding add-on fees known as
points, was 10.44 percent for fixed-rate loans and 8.26 percent for
the most popular type of one-year adjustable rate mortgages, those
with caps on how high the interest can go, according to the Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Both were slightly higher than a week
earlier.
   ``I think this is probably about as good as it gets,'' Michael
Carliner, an economist with the National Association of Home
Builders, said of the sales rate. ``We have seen interest rates
rising over the past few weeks and the rate of economic growth is
likely to slow somewhat.''
   Richard Peach, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association
of America, attributed this year's unexpected strength in the
housing market to the willingness of home purchasers to use either
fixed- or adjustable-rate mortgages, depending on which was the
better deal.
   ``Consumers have switched back and forth ... such that the
weighted average for mortgage rates has held steady at about 9.5
percent since the beginning of 1987,'' he said.
   By region, sales rose 14.6 percent in the Northeast to an annual
rate of 110,000 units, 8.1 percent in the Midwest to a 107,000 unit
rate and 5.1 percent in the West to 266,000. In the South, sales
fell 3.9 percent to an annual rate of 249,000.
   The rate in the West, boosted by strong population growth in
California, has not been higher since March 1979, when 279,000 homes
were sold.
   For the year, sales in the West are running about 12 percent
higher. They're holding steady in the Midwest and South. In the
Northeast, they're running about 9 percent lower, which economists
attribute to high prices.
   The median price of new homes nationally fell 0.9 percent in
October to $115,900, meaning half sold for more and half for less.
That followed a 6.4 percent increase in September.
   The average price, which is pulled up by very expensive homes,
fell 2.1 percent to $140,100 after an identical increase a month
earlier.
   The median was 8.8 percent higher than a year ago, while the
average was 11.4 percent more.

   Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods
increased 1.6 percent in October, driven by a surge in spending for
military equipment, the government said Friday.
   The Commerce Department said orders for durable and non-durable
goods climbed to a seasonally adjusted $226.2 billion, following a
1.9 percent decline in September.
   Defense spending shot up 42.5 percent to $10.6 billion, on the
strength of orders for ships and tanks, after falling 7.0 percent in
September.
   ``The military sector just went through the roof with the opening
of the new fiscal year,'' said David Wyss, an economist with Data
Resources Inc., a forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass. ``The
generals had money in their checking accounts again, so they were
busy writing checks.''
   However, Wyss said even excluding defense orders, manufacturing
remains strong. He pointed to the backlog of unfilled orders, which
jumped 0.8 percent in October, 0.3 percent in September and 1.2
percent in August.
   ``We're still getting more orders in than we're shipping goods
out,'' he said.
   New orders for the first 10 months of this year are up 9.3
percent from a year ago, compared with a 6.6 percent increase
between the same periods in 1987 and 1986.
   However, the key category of non-defense capital goods,
considered a good barometer of industry investment plans, fell 3.0
percent to $33.8 billion, following a large 10.2 percent drop in
September.
   Earlier in the year, this sector provided much of the momentum
for economic growth as industries geared up to meet an export boom
fueled by the lower value of the dollar abroad.
   ``It looks to me like the investment boom has gone past its peak,
and that's bad news. We really need new investment, and having it
fall off is a problem,'' said Robert Brusca, an economist with Nikko
Securities Co. International Inc.
   October orders followed a pattern set over the last several
months in which the presence or absence of big transportation and
military orders influenced overall performance.
   Transportation spending, bolstered by motor vehicle manufacturing
in addition to tank and shipbuilding, jumped 8.5 percent in October
to $34.3 billion after a decline of 8.9 percent in September.
   Excluding the transportation category, orders rose 0.4 percent in
October and fell 0.7 percent in September. Minus defense, orders
edged up 0.2 percent in October after dropping 1.7 percent in
September.
   Orders for all durable goods, ``big ticket'' items expected to
last three or more years, rose 2.3 percent in October to $122.1
billion after a 2.8 percent drop in September.
   Meanwhile, orders for non-durable goods climbed 0.8 percent in
October to $104.2 billion after an identical drop of 0.8 a month
earlier. Chemicals accounted for most of the increase, although most
industries were up.
   Wyss said the vigor in the non-durable industries, which were
having capacity problems early in the year, could signal renewed
price pressures.
   Shipments of manufactured goods were up by 0.5 percent in October
to $222.5 billion.

<HEAD>Duarte Hospitalized, Recovering Well from Intestinal Infection</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon Duarte, who
is suffering from liver cancer, was hospitalized with an intestinal
infection, the Mexican foreign minister said Friday.
   ``He's doing very, very well,'' said Ricardo Acevedo Peralta, the
foreign minister. ``He had a minor intestinal infection but it's
been overcome.''
   Duarte, 63, attended the inauguration of President Carlos Salinas
de Gortari on Thursday.
   He was taken to the hospital with a temperature about 6 p.m.,
Acevedo Peralta said.
   ``He had an exhausting day'' meeting with Presidents Raul
Alfonsin of Argentina, Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala and Daniel Ortega
of Nicaragua in addition to Salinas, Acevedo Peralta said.
   Asked if the problem was the the intestinal malady that afflicts
tourists in Mexico, he replied, ``That's it in part, the change in
diet and the work.''
   ``The president's condition is delicate,'' he said. ``It's better
to have him here (in the hospital) 48 hours. You know you have to
take care of any infection.''
   Duarte probably would return to his hotel Saturday, he said, and
is expected to return to El Salvador on Sunday or Monday.
   In San Salvador, Vice-President Rodolfo Castillo Claramount said
he had spoken to Duarte by telephone Friday and said the health
problem is principally the result of chemotherapy Duarte underwent
recently. The fever was due to an intestinal infection, inflammation
of the colon and slight dehydration, Castillo Claramount said.
   Doctors have said Duarte's health has improved remarkably in the
past two months. The spread of the cancer in his liver has been
arrested and other organs have not been affected, they say.
   He has been handling a nearly normal work load and has made
campaign appearances on behalf of his Christian Democratic Party's
presidential candidate, Fidel Chavez Mena.
   Party officials had counted on Duarte, whose five-year term ends
next year, being able to campaign to boost their prospects in March
19 presidential elections.
   When Duarte arrived in Mexico City on Wednesday, his first stop
was the Basilica of Guadalupe, the holiest shrine for this country's
predominantly Roman Catholic population. He said he had thanked the
Virgin of Guadalupe, to whom the basilica is dedicated, for his
improved health.

   Pity poor Santa. He was arrested in Tennessee, sacked in
California and 25 red-suited Kris Kringles scared the wits out of
children with their chorus of ho-ho-hos. And there are still 22
shopping days left till Christmas.
   Parents in Seattle weren't too happy with Santa, either, after a
TV program urged children to hold a phone near the set for
tone-activated dialing of calls to the North Pole _ at $2 for the
first minute and 30 cents thereafter.
   In Nashville, Tenn., a misunderstanding over a bill for $360 led
to the arrests of two stretch limousines full of Santas who were
taking toys to children at hospitals and agencies for the poor.
   ``We had Santa suits on, no pockets, no money, no checks, no
ID,'' said Vernon Frank Minow, who organized the Santa task force.
Minow said he arranged to rent one limo Wednesday and the AAA Music
City Limousine Service donated a second but demanded $360 for the
cars before all the deliveries were made.
   ``In my 17 years as a policeman, this is the first time I've
arrested Santa Claus,'' said burglary detective Gary Mallory.
   Minow threatened Thursday to sue ``all those involved trying to
stop the good works for the children.''
   Limousine company spokesman Mark Fisher declined comment.
   Newly graduated Santas in Chicago got some final lessons
Wednesday _ including that more isn't always merrier.
   The 25 red-suited, black-booted Kris Kringles invaded a downtown
hotel lobby expecting cheers and laughter. But the sight of so many
of them at once brought out tears, and children ran to their mothers.
   ``I really love kids, but I didn't realize they'd be so scared,''
said Chris Davis, 19, of San Diego. ``I reached out to shake one's
hand and she started crying.''
   Veteran Santa Leonard Utecht, 68, with 48 years behind the beard,
used the incident to teach the new dogs old tricks.
   ``Don't reach down to the little ones from above or they'll
retreat,'' he said. ``If you stoop to their level, you can win them
over.''
   Utecht's basic rules for Santas: Know all the reindeers' names.
Don't make any specific promises. And gently hold the child's hand _
it's soothing and keeps the little dickens from grabbing the beard.
   He might have added one: Don't make it too easy to call the North
Pole.
   Only 10 minutes into a half-hour TV program called ``Here Comes
Santa,'' angry parents began calling KTZZ-TV in Seattle on Thursday
complaining that their children were urged to hold the phone near
the TV set. Electronic tones automatically dialed a call to Santa
Claus.
   After receiving the calls from parents, program director Dan
Lutgen ordered that the words ``ask your parents'' be shown
continuously. Under the station's contract, the production company,
Phone Quest, must reimburse parents for calls made without their
permission, Lutgen said.
   Nancy Bernstrom of US West, the local phone company, said she
could not release figures on the number of calls placed during the
program.
   Santa also was the at the center of a storm in Carson, Calif.
   The NAACP threatened a boycott of a Carson shopping mall where an
employee allegedly made a racist remark about a black Santa Claus.
   The protest was sparked by the firing of Rodney Newton as the
mall's Santa Claus and a remark a mall official allegedly made to
him that ``there is no such thing as a black Santa Claus,''
according to NAACP spokeswoman Ruth Anderson.
   On Friday, the mall and officials from the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People reached an agreement calling
for the firing of the mall employee, suspension of a supervisor and
a public apology.
   Mall owner Mark McGaughey had said race was not a factor, noting
a second black Santa was quickly hired. Newton was fired because he
was too big for a disappearing act in a holiday program stunt,
McGaughey said.

   Deciding that free coffee was not much of a
threat to the public, the county health board has pulled the plug on
a brewing controversy by waiving a rule that even the city council
was violating.
   Few people knew it, but under the law, every business or
organization that gave out coffee or soft drinks to the public was
required to buy a $50 food-service permit.
   That meant all those doctors' offices, beauty shops, auto-repair
businesses and even the City Council, which handed coffee out free,
were in violation.
   This week, the Pueblo County Health Board voted to waive the
required license. Businesses that otherwise are not in the food
business are free to offer coffee, soft drinks or wrapped pastries
to their customers.
   ``We're trying to enforce the intent of the law, not necessarily
the letter of the law,'' said health division chief Roger Stasiak.
``The intent is to protect the public's health, and coffee has not
proven to be a significant problem.''
   ``It's such a burden off my mind,'' joked Merle Souder, manager
of a Meineke discount muffler shop, after the vote was take.
   Souder said he doesn't keep the coffee pot in a public area of
his store, ``but that's not to say some of our regular customers
don't head straight for the coffee pot.''

   Sixty of Hong Kong's burliest policemen failed
Friday in an attempt to break the record set by their British
counterparts for pulling a jumbo jet 100 yards with a rope.
   The record of 57.7 seconds was set by a group of policemen at
London's Heathrow airport in May.
   Huffing and puffing, the policemen here took 1 minute, 11.4
seconds to pull the British Airways Boeing 747 the same distance at
the Hong Kong Airport.
   The event was staged by the Royal Hong Kong Police Force and
British Airways to raise about $25,000 for a home for the
handicapped in this British colony.
   Officer Karl Spencer said his men were disappointed at failing to
break the record, but he said they were at a disadvantage. The plane
together with the fuel weighed at least 185 tons, while the plane at
Heathrow in May was not carrying any fuel and weighed about 170 tons.

   Not even the U.S. Postal Service can
fight City Hall in this Rockford suburb _ not when Mayor Joseph
Sinkiawic's civic pride gets irritated.
   If the U.S. Postal Service had gotten its way, the silver
lettering on the outside of the new post office here would have said
``Rockford, Ill.'' After all, though it's in Loves Park, a town of
15,000, it's a branch of the Rockford office.
   ``That's a real slap in the face as far as we're concerned,''
Sinkiawic said Thursday. ``We're a proud city, and we want to have
an idenity.''
   Thanks to the complaints the mayor made to his congresswoman and
senators, the sign will say what the sign on the previous post
office building said for 40 years: ``Loves Park, Ill.''
   The mayor had called a news conference for Thursday to denounce
the proposed change. Two hours before it was scheduled to begin,
Sinkiawic received a call from Rockford Postmaster Don Brocher
saying the words ``Loves Park, Ill.'' would stay.
   The mayor credited calls Rep. Lynn Martin, and Illinois' two U.S.
senators, Alan Dixon and Paul Simon, with forestalling what would
have been a ``David and Goliath'' battle.

<HEAD>Trade Official Says Bush Supports Tough Bargaining Stance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's top trade official said Friday
that he has the blessing of President-elect George Bush for a tough
U.S. stance on ``agricultural disarmament'' of price supports at an
upcoming round of major international bargaining.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he had met
Thursday with Bush and President Reagan at the White House ``and
they have assured us of their support of our objectives and for our
strategy in Montreal.''
   The Montreal talks, beginning Monday, will draw nearly 100
nations for a mid-term review of the four-year Uruguay Round of
trade negotiations.
   Yeutter spoke at the National Press Club just hours before
leaving for Montreal, where trade ministers will conduct the most
wide-ranging negotiations ever held to liberalize and regulate
international commerce.
   Yeutter, an agricultural economist who said he would be returning
to work in the private sector once Bush takes office in January,
adopted a tough negotiating stand in advance of the talks.
   ``We are willing to leave Montreal without'' any agreement in the
15 categories on the agenda, he said. ``If agreement comes at the
price of sacrificing basic principles, we will not pay that price,''
he said in prepared remarks.
   At the top of the U.S. agenda is obtaining a commitment from the
participants for the eventual elimination of domestic and export
agricultural subsidies, said Yeutter.
   The main opposition comes from the 12-nation European Community,
which faces powerful lobbies opposed to reducing farming price
supports. EC officials have warned in recent days that if the United
States continues to insist on its position, the Uruguay Round could
fail.
   ``We hope that reason will prevail'' among the Europeans, Yeutter
said, because agricultural reform makes too much economic sense to
be abandoned. ``It's inevitable,'' he predicted.
   One argument the United States intends to make is that the
elimination of subsidies would create jobs in the European markets
which suffer high unemployment, would result in lower food costs and
would save billions of dollars in government funding for farmers, he
said.
   A recent study by the Center for International Economics in the
Australian capital of Canberra says agricultural liberalization
would result in 3 million new jobs for Europeans, Yeutter said.
   The United States contends that doing away with government
supports would save some 20 to 30 billion dollars annually in its
own deficit-ridden budget and help farmers compete on an equal
footing on world markets. But agreement on such a move must come
from all the U.S. trading partners, Yeutter said.
   ``No one is going to unilaterally disarm in agriculture,'' he
said. ``If there's going to be any disarmament in agriculture it has
to be a joint effort.''
   If the Uruguay round fails to achieve any progress on this by its
end in 1990, Yeutter said, Congress may as well enact a farm bill
boosting support for farmers.
   Yeutter predicted that controversy would also arise in Montreal
over the U.S. push to modernize the 40-year-old GATT agreement by
including in it the booming world trade in services, such as banking
and tourism, and providing protection for patents and copyrights.
   Piracy in this field is costing American entrepreneurs billions
of dollars annually in lost revenues.
   A large bloc of countries in the developing world argues that
fledgling service industries would be hurt by the proposed
regulations and that copyright protection would greatly increase the
costs of such imports as computer software and pharmaceuticals on
which they depend heavily.

   The State Department will allow Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega to visit the United Nations on Monday even
though his visa application was filed too late for the normal
processing period, it was announced Friday.
   Privately, U.S. officials said Ortega plans to meet with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who will address the U.N. General
Assembly next week and will meet with President Reagan and
President-elect George Bush.
   But sources close to the Nicaraguan government, insisting on
anonymity, said Ortega's main purpose in visiting the United Nations
will be to discuss the effects on Nicaragua of Hurricane Joan, which
devastated broad areas of the country in October.
   The sources said Ortega wants to appeal for additional
international assistance before the effects of the disaster become a
forgotten issue. They were unaware of any plan by Ortega to meet
with Gorbachev.
   State Department deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said visas
were approved for Ortega, his wife, Rosario, and his son, Rafael,
for travel on Dec. 5. They will be accompanied by Ortega's physician
and 14 security guards.
   Mrs. Oakley said their applications were expedited even though
they were not received within the 15 working days the U.S. Embassy
in Managua requires for processing.
   Visa applications from 14 other Nicaraguans who wished to
accompany Ortega as part of his official party, in effect, were
turned down because they were submitted after the deadline for Dec.
5 travel.
   Last September, Ortega canceled a planned trip to the United
Nations because U.S. authorities had not issued sufficient visas for
his delegation. The State Department said at the time most of the
applications were submitted too late to allow adequate time for
processing.

   The State Department said Friday it has
rejected a request from a South Korean legislative committee that
top U.S. diplomatic and military officials testify in person about
their knowledge of any U.S. role in a bloody 1980 uprising in that
country.
   Instead, the department will be willing to respond to written
questions from the committee, deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said.
   The National Assembly committee had asked that then-U.S.
Ambassador William Gleysteen and the commander of U.S. forces in
Korea, John Wickham, testify about their knowledge of the incidents
at Kwangju when hundreds _ perhaps thousands _ of people were killed
in clashes with the South Korean military.
   Mrs. Oakley said the views of Gleysteen and Wickham, both of whom
have since ended their service in Korea, will be incorporated in the
official responses to written questions.
   Allegations have been made that the United States acquiesced in
the transfer of Korean troops to Kwangju for the purpose of
violently suppressing the rebellion.
   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung has said the United States did not
do enough to prevent the killings.
   Mrs. Oakley said that after careful consideration, the department
determined it would be ``inappropriate'' for Gleysteen and Wickham
to testify in person but written responses would be agreed to
because the incident at Kwangju is a matter of ``great concern'' in
Korea.
   In ruling out personal appearances by the two officials, Mrs.
Oakley said the department ``considered basic principles of
international comity and the manner in which foreign relations are
conducted.''
   ``We also considered principals of immunity of government
officials from providing testimony before foreign legislative
bodies,'' she said.
   She added that the department believes it can be fully responsive
to the committee's requirements through written answers.

<HEAD>Bhutto Takes Oath of Office; Promises `Peace, Liberty and Progress'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Benazir Bhutto took the oath of office
Friday as prime minister, assuming the job her father lost in a coup
11 years ago and promising to ``choose the path of law.''
   ``Our message is one of hope, peace, liberty and progress,'' Ms.
Bhutto told a nationwide televised address after the ceremony.
   About 300 Pakistani officials, lawmakers and foreign ambassadors
attended the 15-minute swearing-in ceremony in the presidency, a
flat, modern building between the Senate and National Assembly in
the federal capital.
   After reciting the oath, Ms. Bhutto received an extended round of
applause that was drowned out when members of her Pakistan People's
Party rose and cheered ``Bhutto lives!''
   The 35-year-old woman took the office once held by her father,
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was deposed in a 1977 coup by Gen. Mohammed
Zia ul-Haq and hanged two years later.
   Zia ruled eight years under martial law and three years with a
limited civilian government before he died in an Aug. 17 plane
crash. A caretaker government resigned earlier Friday.
   In her television address, Ms. Bhutto promised her Pakistan's
People's Party ``will choose the path of law, eradicate hunger and
poverty, give shelter to the shelterless, employment to the
unemployed and we will educate the illiterate.''
   But she painted a bleak economic picture, saying ``our entire
fiscal system is nearing bankruptcy. We are faced with the prospect
of disaster, but a whole generation is ready to channel everything
in the direction of reconstruction.''
   Ms. Bhutto had pledged since her father's death to oust Zia and
restore democracy to Pakistan.
   ``Our struggle has now reached a successful culmination,'' she
said. ``The doors of Parliament that were shut are now open.''
   Before Zia's death, elections had been scheduled for Nov. 16.
   Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party won 105 seats in the
237-seat National Assembly, and she is said to have enough support
among minor parties and independents for a majority coalition.
   An eight-party grouping called the Islamic Democratic Alliance,
which includes Zia loyalists, won only 60 seats.
   Ms. Bhutto's father, the late Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, founded the
Pakistan People's Party that she now leads.
   ``I feel a mixture of happiness and sadness because I kept
thinking about my husband,'' said Bhutto's widow, Begum Nusrat
Bhutto, after she watched her daughter officially assume leadership.
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan said he had received the resignations
of the caretaker government effective Friday.
   Ms. Bhutto, who studied at Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Mass.,
and at Oxford University in England, wed Karachi businessman Asif
Ali Zardari in a traditional Islamic arranged marriage a year ago.
She gave birth to a boy Sept. 21.
   Zia, U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphel and 28 others died in the
August crash. Officials said sabotage was the probable cause, but
the probe is continuing.

<HEAD>U.S. Ambassador: East Germany Far From Diplomatic Ties With Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany has an ``extremely bad'' human rights
record and the Berlin Wall continues to bar better trade and
diplomatic ties with the United States, according to the departing
U.S. ambassador.
   Ambassador Francis J. Meehan called East Germany's claim it is
not responsible for Nazi crimes ``a bit ridiculous.''
   He predicted the communist nation will be slow to establish
diplomatic relations with Israel, despite recent wooing of Jewish
leaders.
   Meehan, 64, spoke in an interview Nov. 22 on condition his name
not be used until he left East Berlin on Dec. 1. He had been posted
there since 1985.
   On prospects for diplomatic ties with Israel, he said:
   ``I think they will be the slowest ship in the convoy to Tel
Aviv,'' although ``there is no question that East Germany now wants
to make an impact on the world Jewish community.''
   East Berlin and Tel Aviv have never had diplomatic relations.
   A procession of Jewish leaders have visited East Germany recently
and elaborate state-sponsored ceremonies in November marked the 50th
anniversary of the start of the Nazi pogrom.
   ``They know that they have lagged behind in this and that it is
important to get the world recognition they want,'' said Meehan.
   But he said the state's recent official treatment of Jewish
issues contrasts starkly to its refusal to accept moral
responsibility for the Holocaust.
   East Germany contends it is innocent of Nazi crimes because it
was founded in 1949 and because communists also were persecuted.
   ``This position is a bit ridiculous,'' Meehan said. ``It amounts
to saying the place was neutral territory during the war.''
   Meehan also noted that overtures to Jews are clouded by the
government's crackdown on the Lutheran Church because it has pushed
for dialogue inspired by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
policy of greater openness.
   ``This is where the tolerance ends,'' Meehan said. ``The party
leadership is pursuing a needlessly severe attitude.''
   Church publications have been censored or seized and human rights
activists allied with the church have been detained.
   ``In all, East Germany has an extremely bad record in human
rights,'' he said. This record and its refusal to pay U.S. claims
for seized property are main stumbling blocks to better relations
with Washington, he said.
   East Germany's desire for Most-Favored Nation trade status was
``out of the question.''
   ``It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to try and
argue in the Congress that there was a case for MFN for East Germany
so long as the wall is there and and so long as there are major
limitations on freedom of emigration,'' Meehan said.
   And there would be little growth in trade as long as U.S. claims
are unresolved.
   East Germany refuses to consider $80 million in claims filed by
U.S. companies and citizens for property lost after the nation was
founded. Interest has boosted the sum to $300 million.
   Meehan expected little change in East German leaders' resistance
to Soviet-style reforms.
   ``They don't quite know what's happening. They don't know where
it's leading and they're very unsure of the whole situation,'' he
said.
   But because East Germany's economy is strong compared with other
Warsaw Pact countries, it can afford to wait to gauge the outcome of
Gorbachev's reforms, he said.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told China's foreign
minister Friday he sees a basis for beginning the ``concluding
stage'' of settling their dispute over Cambodia, and called for
direct Chinese-Vietnamese talks on the issue.
   Gorbachev also discussed a likely 1989 Soviet-Chinese summit
meeting in the session with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. It was the
first visit of such a high-ranking Chinese official to the Soviet
Union in 31 years.
   ``From the Soviet viewpoint there was a basis for bringing the
solution of the problem into the concluding stage,'' Gorbachev told
Qian, according to the official Soviet news agency Tass.
   ``As far as we know, a similar constructive spirit marks the
stance of the Vietnamese comrades and the leadership of the People's
Republic of Kampuchea (Cambodia),'' Gorbachev said. ``A dialogue
between China and Vietnam could play an important role.''
   Gorbachev has made several overtures to China, including an
effort to settle the dispute over Cambodia, the most divisive issue
that remains between the countries.
   He urged they continue to improve their relations.
   ``I think that our vital interests are not contradictory, while
cooperation has good chances both from the viewpoint of domestic
requirements, the tasks of modernization tackled by the two
countries, and from the international viewpoint,'' Gorbachev said.
   ``We are satisfied on the whole with the development of
cooperation in various spheres of life,'' he said. ``But we believe
that this is only a beginning.''
   He called for more scientific, cultural, youth and tourist
exchanges.
   China wants the Soviet Union to use its influence to get all
Vietnamese soldiers out of Cambodia, where they have been fighting a
Chinese-backed resistance for the past decade, and the dispute has
been the main stumbling block to a Soviet-Chinese summit.
   Soviet-Chinese relations soured in the early 1960s in a struggle
over the direction of the world communist movement. Relations
reached a low point in 1969 when they fought a brief frontier war.
   But Gorbachev has ordering a pullout of Soviet troops from
Afghanistan, reducing Soviet troops on the Chinese border, and
agreeing to direct talks about the Vietnamese presence in Cambodia.
   Without providing details, Tass said the discussion also touched
on Afghanistan.
   Tass said Gorbachev and Qian also discussed a likely
Chinese-Soviet summit next year.
   ``It was noted in the conversation that the leaders of the
U.S.S.R. and China were now considering having a summit meeting.
Both sides attach great importance to it,'' Tass said.
   The summit is likely to occur in the first half of 1989, with
Gorbachev traveling to Beijing because senior Chinese leader Deng
Xioping is 84 and rarely travels abroad.

<TEXT>
   The hijacking of a jetliner by five armed
Soviets who surrendered here Friday comes at a time of increasing
contacts between Moscow and Israel.
   The cooperation between Israeli and Soviet officials and the fact
the hijacking ended without bloodshed could accelerate the process
of reconciliation.
   Some analysts were encouraged by the fact that Soviet authorities
asked Israel to let the Aeroflot jet land, maintained diplomatic
contacts throughout the day, and sent the head of their mission in
Israel to observe events at Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv.
   ``This can only be seen as an improvement in relations and an
important step forward for Israel's ... standing with the Soviets,''
said Ted Friedgut, a professor of Soviet politics at Hebrew
University.
   ``In the past, the Soviets would never have considered giving the
plane authority to come to Israel. Perhaps they wanted to signal
that they're ready to trust Israel with something serious ... It
could be a step toward normal relations,'' Friedgut said in an
interview.
   A Foreign Ministry official also welcomed the cooperation but was
more restrained in his optimism.
   ``Of course everybody will be very happy if this ends in good
cooperation between the two countries,'' the official said on
condition of anonymity.
   ``I wouldn't say it should be regarded as a breakthrough. But
yes, you may say it shows the Soviets at least have the minimum
confidence that things will be handled properly here,'' he said.
   The Foreign Ministry indicated Israel would react positively to a
Soviet request for extradition.
   ``The moment we get a request, we will examine it. I don't see
any reason why we would want to hold them,'' said spokesman Alon
Liel.
   The Soviets broke diplomatic ties with Israel after the 1967
Middle East war when the Jewish state seized the West Bank, Gaza
Strip, east Jerusalem and Golan Heights from Moscow's Arab allies.
   A gradual thaw in relations began in July 1987 when the Soviet
Union sent a quasi-permanent consular delegation to Tel Aviv. Israel
responded by sending a delegation to Moscow in April.
   This year the Soviet Union met a key Israeli demand by permitting
a growing number of Jews to leave the country. The year's exodus of
16,572 Jews through November is more than double last year's outflow
of 8,011. The 1988 emigration figure is expected to be the highest
in eight years.
   The warming of ties also has extended to the Soviet-allied
Eastern bloc, all of whose members severed ties with Israel in 1967
except Romania.
   In September, Hungary announced it was renewing full diplomatic
ties after a 21-year break. The announcement followed visits to
Budapest by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres.
   Cultural ties have also been improving. Moments after the
hijackers surrendered, Yevgeny Yevtushenko, a 55-year-old Soviet
poet, landed in Israel for a series of poetry readings in Jerusalem,
Tel Aviv and other Israeli towns.
   ``It is such an unhappy incident, but I am landing here
completely voluntarily,'' Yevtushenko joked on Israel televison.

<HEAD>Percentage of Americans Working Hit Record High in November</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With 463,000 new payroll jobs indicating a
continuing booming economy, the percentage of Americans at work
reached an all-time high in November despite a slight increase in
the unemployment rate, the government said Friday.
   The job growth was twice what economists had anticipated and
nearly double the 238,000 increase in new jobs in October. But a
560,000 person increase in the civilian labor force _ those holding
or seeking jobs _ raised the unemployment rate from a 14-year low of
5.3 percent in October to 5.4 percent last month, the Labor
Department said.
   ``Whenever we have strong employment growth, we usually bring
more people into the labor force,'' Labor Statistics Commissioner
Janet L. Norwood said.
   She added that she expects the 560,000 figure _ the biggest
one-month increase since June 1986 _ to be revised downward later
when the government has more data.
   The labor force has been growing at a monthly rate of less than
200,000 over the past year, with 100,000 fewer teen-agers seeking
jobs in 1988 than in 1987.
   That trend is expected to continue until 1994 when the offspring
of the post-World War II Baby Boom generation begin reaching
employment age in greater numbers, Norwood told the Joint Economic
Committee of Congress.
   Despite the slight increase in the unemployment rate, the
government figures showed 116 million Americans holding jobs last
month, or 62.6 percent of the adult population age 16 or over. Both
are record highs.
   The November job gains were widespread, including virtually every
industry except for oil and gas drilling and department stores.
   ``It's quite clear that department stores are building up for the
Christmas holiday at a much slower rate than previously,'' Norwood
said.
   Of the 463,000 new payroll jobs in November, factory jobs rose by
71,000 on top of a four-year record-high 99,000 new assembly line
workers in October. Manufacturing employment is now 425,000 above
what it was a year ago.
   Nearly one-fourth of the factory job gains have been in
machinery, indicating that the nation's economic growth is being
spurred as much by exports as increased consumer spending.
   Meanwhile, factory workers continued to average four hours of
overtime a week last month. ``That suggests we're going to have even
more employment gains in the next few months,'' said Allen Sinai,
chief economist for the Boston Co., a financial consulting house.
   Construction employment increased by 55,000 in November,
reflecting an upturn in housing starts after sluggish activity from
July through October, as well as unusually warm weather for the
month.
   In a separate report, the Commerce Department said new home sales
rose 3.5 percent in October to their highest level in more than a
year.
   Factory orders also rose 1.6 percent in October, the Commerce
Department said in another report, largely on military buying.
However, orders for non-defense capital goods _ a key barometer of
businessmen's expectations of the economy _ declined for the second
consecutive month.
   ``Before an election people tend to push off capital expenditures
as long as there is some uncertainty ... and there has been some
talk of a recession,'' said Charles Renfro, an analyst for
Alphametrics, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting firm. ``Come midwinter
or early spring there might be some big increases.''
   The employment gains sent bond prices down among traders fearing
an inflation from an overheating economy. Earlier this week, the
Federal Reserve released a survey by its 12 banks declaring that the
economy was slowing.
   However, analysts both inside and out of the government said the
November employment figures indicate another month of strong growth
just like October.
   ``This many jobs wouldn't be showing up unless the economy was
very strong,'' Sinai said. ``The Fed's strategy of small doses of
interest rate hikes since last March to slow it down clearly has not
worked. The economy is moving ahead at a rate close to 4 percent,
while its (non-inflationary) potential is only 2.4 percent.''
   Renfro disagreed with the perception that continuing large job
gains every month is a sign that the economy is overheating.
   ``That would be true if consumers were trying to purchase more
goods than are being produced,'' he said. ``But it looks like the
growth is coming from exports, and that's good news.''
   The fear among analysts since early 1987 when unemployment rates
began falling into the range of 6 percent was that tighter job
markets would begin pushing wages up faster than prices, setting off
a wage-price spiral.
   But there was no evidence of that last month, with the average
wage among production workers unchanged from the $9.45 in October
and only 3.3 percent above what it was a year ago. Consumer prices,
meanwhile, have climbed at an annual rate of 4.6 percent so far this
year.
   ``One month's figures can't be taken too seriously,'' said Sinai.
``If you look over the past three months, it shows earnings rising
at 4.5 percent annually.''
   The Reagan administration, in its final economic forecast, last
month predicted that inflation will slow to 3.7 percent next year,
with a decrease in unemployment to an average 5.2 percent on
economic growth of 3.5 percent.
   Norwood said accomplishing all three simultaneously will be
``very, very difficult'' but she did not rule out the possibility
that it can happen.
   ``The labor force is growing by half the rate it was in the
1970s, so it's going to be somewhat easier to maintain lower
unemployment levels,'' she said. ``And at the moment, there is not
much upward pressure (on inflation) from wages.''

<TEXT>
   A mail carrier making his rounds heard a
scream and rescued a blind woman and her guide dog who had fallen
into a 9-foot-deep hole.
   ``I feel he was really my angel for Christmas,'' Connie Kelley
said after her rescue Thursday. ``Probably he will have an extra
present under his Christmas tree this year.''
   Jack Grothe, 37, a four-year employee with the U.S. Postal
Service, said he was delivering mail when he heard Ms. Kelley
scream. He found her and her guide dog, Dazzle, trapped in a hole
which was dug by workers repairing a water line.
   ``I couldn't reach her,'' Grothe said. ``I had to jump in. ... I
picked her up, walked to the edge, pushed her out and her dog, then
got out myself.''
   ``Being a mailman, I'm a little cautious with dogs, and this dog
was really wonderful,'' Grothe said.
   Ms. Kelley, 29, said she was going shopping when she fell into
the hole _ and through no fault of the guide dog.
   ``My dog was hesitant at first, and I made her go forward,'' she
said. ``She saw the hole up ahead I didn't know was there.''
   As the dog tried to squeeze her between the hole and a ladder,
Ms. Kelley's foot slipped and she fell in, dragging Dazzle with her.
She said she was trapped in there three to five minutes before
Grothe found her.
   ``I think if I had been there any longer I wouldn't have had the
strength to get out of there with help,'' she said.
   Doug Michaud, chief inspector for utility connections for the
city of Minneapolis, said employees of Pete's Water and Sewer had
neglected to put guard rails around the hole and had left it
unattended.
   He said he had reprimanded the owner, Dennis Skjod, but lacked
the power to issue a citation.
   Skjod said his workers told him they had left the site to get
some parts and that they had put up a small barricade, enough to
warn away a sighted person.
   ``It's a lesson to be learned,'' he said. ``From now on, when we
do jobs we'll have sightless people in mind, and I thank God nothing
serious happened.'' He said he called Ms. Kelley and visited her
home after hearing about the accident.

   Michael Dukakis visited Washington Friday for
the first time since losing the presidential election, sadly
conceding ``I wish I was here in another capacity.''
   Still, he received warm welcomes from Democratic Party leaders on
Capitol Hill during a morning full of meetings before going to the
home of the man who defeated him, President-elect George Bush, for a
private visit.
   ``When it's all over, we don't throw bombs at each other; we sit
down with each other,'' Dukakis said before his session with Bush.
   Afterward, Dukakis had few kind personal words for his bitter
election rival but promised to cooperate with the new
administration, provided Bush works to cut the federal deficit
without turning his back on health care, day care, education and
other issues that the Democrat focused on during his campaign.
   ``Do I look bitter?'' Dukakis asked in response to a question
after a 35-minute meeting with Bush. ``I feel pretty good actually.''
   Dukakis said the meeting did not include any talk about the tone
of the campaign, which Dukakis criticized at the time. ``That's over
now and our job is to meet some very formidable problems,'' he said.
But he managed to work in a swipe at Reagan administration deficit
spending and warned Bush against continuing such policies.
   Asked if he now considered himself a friend of the
president-elect, Dukakis at first laughed and then said: ``I'm
anxious to cooperate and play a constructive role.''
   Bush, in brief comments to reporters, said he looked forward to
working with Dukakis and other governors.
   ``To you and Kitty and that wonderful family, God bless you and
have a great Christmas,'' Bush told the departing Dukakis.
   Dukakis also had a brief encounter with Vice President-elect Dan
Quayle, who was at the Bush residence when Dukakis arrived.
   ``We shook hands and greeted each other,'' said Dukakis, who
during the campaign scornfully referred to the Indiana senator in
nearly every speech.
   The trip to the nation's capital was far different from the last
time Dukakis came, near the end of the campaign, when he still had
Secret Service protection and was accompanied by a phalanx of aides.
This time he took a commercial flight, accompanied by only two
aides, and traveled around town in a crowded rental car. He met with
Washington-based campaign workers before heading home to Boston.
   Dukakis had lunch Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, who was the
Democratic vice presidential nominee, and met separately with
congressional leaders including House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas,
and new Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   Some party leaders have been highly critical of Dukakis and his
presidential campaign, but Bentsen, Wright and Mitchell said he
still had a part to play in party leadership.
   ``I think it's a very major role,'' Bentsen said.
   ``We're very proud of Mike Dukakis,'' Wright said at an earlier
meeting. ``He fought a good fight.''
   Dukakis dodged questions about whether he would consider running
for president again, saying he was too busy catching up on
gubernatorial duties to think about his political future.
   But Wright said, ``All of us look to him for leadership, for
ideas, for guidance, for cooperation. ... Governor Dukakis is young.
His future is not behind him. It is ahead of him. I think he has a
lot to give this country.''
   Dukakis thanked the speaker for his praise but did not hide his
disappointment in losing the election.
   ``I think in time I'll probably emerge stronger but I'd be less
than candid if I didn't say I wish I was here in another capacity,''
Dukakis said.
   Mitchell, after a separate meeting with his fellow New Englander,
also praised Dukakis as ``a national leader of our party.''
   Dukakis promised to maintain a party presence but did not claim
to be the Democrats' national leader.
   ``We have a good strong party, with lots of leaders,'' he said.
``I hope to make a contribution.''
   Just a week before the election Dukakis said he had no respect
for Bush because of the negative tone of the Republican campaign,
but on Friday he refused to be drawn into a new battle with his
election rival.
   ``I'm looking ahead; I assume he is,'' Dukakis said. ``The
election is over.''
   Dukakis also visited with Massachusetts Sens. Edward Kennedy and
John Kerry. Kennedy offered a question for Bush.
   ``The first thing we want to know is whether he still considers
Massachusetts a part of the union and we hope to get a positive
response,'' the senator said jokingly.
   Dukakis has been dealing with a state financial crisis at home
but plans to take a Florida vacation after next week. Spokesman
James Dorsey said Dukakis had no high-profile appearances planned
until February, when he is to return to Washington for the winter
meeting of the National Governors' Association.

<HEAD>Letter Says Swiss Kidnapped To Swap For Hijacker; Cleric Blasts
U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>

   A letter apparently signed by a kidnapped
Swiss Red Cross official and released Friday implied he was abducted
to be exchanged for a hijacker held in Geneva.
   A leading cleric, meanwhile, said the United States was
preventing the release of the nine American hostages held in Lebanon.
   No group has claimed responsibility for the abduction of Peter
Winkler, the 32-year-old Swiss Red Cross delegate seized by three
gunmen in the southern port of Sidon Nov. 17.
   ``I was not kidnapped as a Red Cross delegate but as a Swiss
citizen. My government knows what my kidnappers want from it and it
has to cooperate in order to save my life,'' said the letter,
delivered to a Western news agency.
   The 56-word letter in English did not include a picture of
Winkler, which is the usual method of proving its authenticity, nor
did it provide any indication of the kidnappers' identity.
   Lebanese police theorize Winkler was seized to swap him for
Shiite Moslem air pirate Hussein Hariri. He has been held in
Switzerland for more than 16 months and is scheduled to go on trial
Feb. 20.
   The Red Cross confirmed the signature was Winkler's and the Swiss
government warned its citizens to avoid all but essential travel to
Lebanon.
   ``It looks very much like blackmail,'' said Edouard Brunner, the
No. 2 man in the Swiss Foreign Ministry.
   Shiite Moslem cleric Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah charged
Friday that the United States has complicated the release of
Americans held by pro-Iranian factions in Lebanon.
   ``I have information that the Americans are the ones who
complicated the issue of the hostages,'' said Fadlallah, who has
close ties with Iran, in an interview with the weekly magazine
Ash-Shiraa.
   ``America is panting after a resumption of ties with Iran, but it
wants ties resumed in a way by which no political concession is
made,'' he said. ``Iran rejects a resumption of ties unless America
changed its hostile policy against Iran as well as some details
related to bilateral relations including the frozen Iranian assets
and others.''
   Fadlallah is the reputed spiritual guide of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God. Hezbollah, made up of Shiite zealots
loyal to Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, is the umbrella group
for pro-Iranian underground factions holding most of the 14 Western
hostages.
   The hostage held longest is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March
16, 1985.
   The Red Cross suspended its Sidon operations _ including services
for the handicapped and visiting Palestinians detained in Israeli
prisons _ and withdrew the remaining five Swiss delegates.
   Harari, 22, a member of Hezbollah, hijacked an Air Afrique
jetliner while on flight from Rome to Paris and forced it to land at
Geneva airport July 24, 1987. He killed a French passenger before he
was overpowered and arrested.
   Also Friday, the mother of 32-year-old Belgian physician Jan
Cools pleaded in a videotaped message for help in finding her son,
missing in Lebanon for more than six months.
   No group has claimed to have kidnapped Cools, missing after
leaving his residence in south Lebanon's Palestinian refugee camp of
Rashidiyeh May 21.

   Black leaders protested Friday in a
newly declared ``whites-only'' park, but the ultra-conservative town
council vowed to resist mounting pressure to abandon increased
segregation.
   ``We are going to carry out fearlessly the will of the white
people,'' Conservative Party official Koos van der Merwe said at an
emotional news conference in Boksburg. ``We will never surrender!
Never! Never! Never!''
   He said Conservatives are establishing a fund to support
councilors who become targets of economic sanctions aimed at forcing
them to reverse their decision.
   The Conservatives, who took control of Boksburg's town council in
nationwide local elections Oct. 26, called the conference to rebut
claims by the governing National Party that three Conservative
councilors planned to defect. That would tip the balance of power on
the 20-member council and enable the National Party faction to allow
blacks back to public facilities in the industrial town east of
Johannesburg.
   One by one, the 12 Conservative councilors stood up and pledged
their support for their party's policy.
   One of the resegegrated facilities is the town's 37-acre park,
Boksburg Lake, where 11 black leaders from neighboring townships
staged a peaceful protest.
   ``South Africa belongs to all of us,'' declared Tom Boya, head of
a national association of black local officials.
   The protest was billed as a mass sit-in, but the officials said
poor organization led to a low turnout. Dozens of reporters, but no
police, were on hand.
   ``Be warned, do not push the patience of the people too far,''
Boya said, asking, ``Where is this beautiful town being led? Is it
being pushed to the Stone Age where no black person was supposed to
be in town after certain times?''
   Boksburg was the first of several Conservative-controlled towns
to announce resegregation of facilities opened to all races in
recent years. The party won control of about 100 towns in October.
In some, councilors are considering curfews for blacks.
   Black residents are boycotting Boksburg's white-owned shops, and
sports federations and corporations have threatened to withdraw from
towns where resegregation takes place.
   The National Party, which enacted South Africa's apartheid laws
during 40 years in power, has denounced the Conservatives' moves,
but has been widely accused of hypocrisy.
   ``What we are doing is done by the National Party is every second
town,'' van der Merwe said. ``They should either stop criticizing us
or open all the water fountains, swimming pools, libraries and
beaches.''
   Early Friday, a bomb exploded outside a tax office in Boksburg.
Police said no one was injured in the blast, caused by a small
limpet mine. There was no indication whether it was connected to the
racial controversy.

<HEAD>West Germans Recall Fateful Discovery of Nuclear Fission 50 Years
Ago</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Eberhard Diepgen extolled the discovery of
nuclear fission Friday, but said he cannot celebrate consequences
``from Hiroshima to Chernobyl'' as West Germans marked the 50th
anniversary of the breakthrough. Mixed with praise for the
scientific leap were words of caution about end results of the
revelation in a Berlin laboratory by German scientists Otto Hahn and
Fritz Strassmann in December 1938.
   ``We cannot simply pay respect to the enormous and unexpected
satisfaction of the human thirst for knowledge, without at the same
time also calling to mind the consequences _ from Hiroshima to
Chernobyl,'' the mayor told 1,100 guests at West Berlin's Congress
Hall.
   Other speakers also pointed to the bitter lessons of the U.S.
bombing of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August
1945 and the April 1986 nuclear accident at Chernobyl in the Soviet
Union.
   ``This discovery changed the world like hardly any other one
before it, technically and spiritually as well as economically and
above all politically,'' Diepgen said.
   ``Today we recall this great scientific deed, without being able
to celebrate,'' said the mayor, a member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
conservative Christian Democratic party.
   Resistance to nuclear power remains strong among younger West
Germans, especially since Chernobyl. The disaster in the Soviet
Ukraine dumped radioactivity over large parts of West Germany,
causing widespread restrictions on sales of fresh meat and produce.
   West Germans, located at the front line of the East-West
struggle, also remain wary of nuclear weapons despite the current
removal of medium-range U.S. rockets from their soil.
   On Dec. 16, 1938, Hahn and Strassmann started their fateful
experiment in a laboratory in Berlin's Dahlem section. It showed
that bombarding the uranium atom with neutrons leads to its
splitting.
   At first the pair were unsure of the implications. Then, from her
exile in Sweden, their Jewish colleague Lise Meitner theorized that
such a splitting could lead to the release of huge amounts of energy
through chain reactions.
   Hahn won the 1944 Nobel Prize in chemistry for the work conducted
at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry.
   Albert Speer, the Nazi arms minister, later implied Hahn was
among German scientists trying to develop the atomic bomb bu many
people say Hahn dissociated himself from such efforts.
   During Friday's ceremony, researcher Professor Peter Brix said
the Hahn and Strassmann discovery, besides leading to nuclear power,
also brought about advancements in nuclear medicine and even
astrophysics.
   ``On the other side of the coin'' were victims of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, nuclear weapons stockpiles and distrust of nuclear power
since Chernobyl, he said.
   ``Many people now have a basic mistrust of science,'' added Brix,
who is from West Germany's prestigious Max-Planck Institute.
   It organized the formal ceremony with four other scientific
research organizations.

   Space shuttle Atlantis lifted off
into a windy sky at the last possible minute Friday _ a
spectacularly public act to carry into orbit a $500 million secret
satellite that can pierce darkness or clouds to vastly enhance
America's capacity to spy on the Soviets.
   Not a word was heard outside the NASA and Air Force control rooms
from commander Robert Gibson or the four other military crewmen who
are carrying out the highly classified mission to deploy the 18-ton
satellite Lacrosse.
   Air Force Secretary Edward C. Aldridge, who observed the liftoff
from the control center, thanked the launch team, saying ``let me
tell you that you have made a great contribution to the nation's
national security.''
   NASA waited out the same kind of fierce, high-altitude winds that
caused the postponement of the flight Thursday, found a momentary
calm, and set Atlantis flying almost straight up on a northward path
from the Kennedy Space Center. Liftoff time was exactly 9:30:34 EST
_ less than 90 seconds before the end of the three-hour launch
opportunity period.
   ``Very clean, by the numbers,'' is how mission commentator Brian
Welch at Mission Control in Houston characterized the start of the
flight. ``The vehicle is in very clean shape. There are no systems
problems whatsoever to report.''
   The public communications system, a 24-hour operation on most
shuttle flights, fell silent thereafter. Acting on Air Force orders,
NASA planned to break that silence only to say that the astronauts
had an OK to proceed with their mission's task and to give 24-hour
notice for Atlantis' return. The flight is expected to last three or
four days with landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California.
   The first announcement came four hours into flight, when Mission
Control reported: ``The crew of Atlantis is go for orbit
operations.'' That meant the ship's cargo bay doors were open and
the task of preparing the satellite for deployment could begin.
   ``All crew members are doing well and all systems of the orbiter
are performing satisfactorily,'' Mission Control said.
   Navy Cmdr. Gibson's crew is Air Force Lt. Col. Guy S. Gardner,
the pilot; Col. Richard M. Mullane and Lt. Col. Jerry L. Ross of the
Air Force, and Navy Cmdr. William M. Shepherd.
   The outlines of their mission no longer are a secret _ not even
to the Soviets _ but details remain classified. Filling Atlantis'
cargo hold is one of the most expensive satellites ever built. It is
not deterred by clouds or darkness from gathering radar images on
the ground below.
   Atlantis' liftoff on the 27th shuttle flight and the third
all-military mission was witnessed by a smaller-than-usual crowd of
a few thousand space enthusiasts along nearby rivers and roadsides.
It was the third time Atlantis had been launched into orbit.
   The shuttle was in view of the launch site well past the
two-minute point when its spent booster rockets fell off. The
failure of a booster rocket joint led to the destruction of
Challenger and loss of its seven-person crew on Jan. 28, 1986.
   According to sources who spoke on condition they not be
identified, Mullane will use the shuttle's crane to drop the
satellite _ one of a series named Lacrosse _ overboard. The
satellite's orbit will take it over the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe, and the information it gleans should help U.S. intelligence
officials verify Soviet arms control compliance as well as serving
as a ``radar eye'' for the new B2 stealth bomber.
   Defense officials contended the secrecy made it more difficult
for Soviet satellites and spy ships off the Florida coast to monitor
the flight and learn its purpose.
   According to the official news agency Tass, the Soviets already
know much about Lacrosse. Its antenna, sources said, spreads out 150
feet and it has a 100-foot long radar screen.
   During deployment of the satellite, believed set for Saturday,
Mullane reportedly will manipulate the remote robot arm to lift the
satellite out of the cargo bay. Shepherd and Ross reportedly will be
suited up in the spacecraft airlock, prepared to make a spacewalk if
there is a problem with the satellite release.
   After the Lacrosse is set free, Gibson and Gardner are to back
off several hundred feet and fly formation with the payload until
ground controllers are certain it is working properly. If it is not,
an effort may be made to retrieve it for return to Earth.
   The sources also report the five crew members will conduct
several experiments aimed at defining man's role as a military
observer in space, with reconnaissance a high priority.
   It is believed the astronauts will test a special optical device
that resembles hand-held binoculars.
   The tests will be coordinated with undisclosed ground exercises
that could include troop maneuvers, naval movements or ballistic
missile launches.
   The countdown was halted several times during the morning to wait
out high-altitude winds up to 126 mph. Starting before dawn, a pilot
flew continuously through the launch path and balloons were sent
aloft to take readings.
   Thursday's launch had been scrubbed by strong winds eight miles
high and clouds made conditions marginal at best. Friday, by
contrast, the sky was brilliantly blue and there was bright sunshine
above fleecy clouds. The troublesome winds were five miles up.
   Toward the end of the 6:32-to-9:32 a.m. ``window of
opportunity,'' launch control got balloon data that showed
acceptable winds. The count continued only to be halted again at the
31-second mark, because of concern about weather at a site in Spain
where the shuttle would have landed in case of emergency.
   ``You gave us some heart failure there toward the end, but we got
it off,'' NASA Administrator James C. Fletcher told the launch team.
``My thanks for another great job.''

<HEAD>Weinberger Hits Loans to Soviets as Strengthening Military</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger
on Friday sharply attacked $7 billion in European loans to Moscow as
a potential aid to the Soviet military.
   ``These may be all going into production of better fertilizer,''
he said in a speech to business executives. ``The same chemicals,
however, are used for chemical warfare in many cases. The problem is
we don't know. I don't think we are at the stage where we can trust
unquestioningly their pretensions.''
   The loans are not linked to particular transactions and have been
made in the past two months, he said. He added that the bulk of them
are guaranteed by west European governments.
   In other remarks prepared in advance he called for immediate
high-level consultations by the United States and its allies on
issues of economic and financial security.
   ``I think NATO _ with full EC (European Economic Community) and
Japanese endorsement _ should incorporate these new issues into
plans to bolster alliance defense burden-sharing and ensure that the
West does not continue the gratuitous, undisciplined financing of
many Soviet activities around the world inimical to vital Western
security interests,'' he wrote.
   He defined burden-sharing as: ``They (America's allies) pay more
and we pay less.''
   A member of the audience commented that U.S. grain sales also
help the Soviet Union by freeing up its resources.
   ``We're guilty too,'' Weinberger replied.
   ``I'm not criticizing Europeans. I'm criticizing the rush to do
this on a rather broad basis and without any attempt to verify what
the proceeds are going to be used for.''
   In his prepared remarks he pointed to Soviet sales of bonds in
the West and the possibility that in time millions of Westerners
could wittingly or unwittingly hold such bonds in their own
portfolios or through pension funds.
   ``And, inevitably, soon thereafter, they would be told that that
was another reason to grant favors and help that `nice' Mr.
Gorbachev,'' Weinberger said.
   He noted reports that billions of Western dollars are on deposit
in banks owned by the Soviet bloc.
   Weinberger criticized what he called the growing romance between
the 12 governments of the community and the communist bloc. He said
businesses owned partly by west Europeans and partly by the Soviet
Union are a rapid way of putting Western know-how into Soviet hands.
   Weinberger, who stepped down as defense secretary in 1987, was
speaking at a business managers' conference on plans by the European
community governments to dismantle barriers to trade among them by
the year 1992.
   He said greater European unity could help Western defense, for
example by promoting standard weapons that could be used by all NATO
members.

   Oliver L. North's remaining challenges to
Iran-Contra charges were rejected by a judge Friday, but the major
counts against him could still be scuttled by White House refusal to
release classified documents.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell rejected defense motions to
dismiss charges that the former National Security Council staff
member obstructed congressional investigations of reports he gave
covert military assistance to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   The decisions were released as Gesell took the bench for a third
straight day of closed hearings on North's objections to censoring
395 government documents that independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh
wants to use as evidence against him. The secret hearings were
scheduled to resume Tuesday.
   Gesell's rulings disposed of the last of North's pre-trial
motions. His decisions have upheld 14 of the 16 charges originally
brought against North by Walsh.
   But the Reagan administration's decision not to allow North to
use any of the 40,000 pages of secret documents sought as defense
evidence poses a serious obstacle to going forward with the major
charges against the former presidential aide.
   About 90 percent of the classified material pertains to the broad
conspiracy charge that North and his three co-defendants illegally
diverted more than $14 million in profits from U.S. arms sales to
Iran to the Contras.
   The rest of the material involves 12 other counts, particularly
charges that North lied to Congress and destroyed NSC documents to
obstruct an inquiry of the Iran-Contra affair.
   Gesell has said repeatedly that North should be given wide
latitude to introduce secret documents relevant to defending the
conspiracy charge and a related count of theft of government
property.
   The judge has threatened to dismiss those charges if secret
documents he determines are necessary to North's defense are not
made available by the government for use at a public trial.
   On Thursday, President Reagan ruled out pardoning North but said
``duty requires'' him to withhold secret documents from the trial.
   Reagan denied the decision was a back-door maneuver to let North
off the hook on the major charges. ``The things we're blocking are
the things that duty requires we block,'' he said.
   Walsh contends that North does not need to disclose any secrets
to get a fair trial of the charges. He has asked Gesell to bar any
release by lawyers for the retired Marine lieutenant colonel.
   Gesell gave North until Dec. 19 to specify any other secrets he
considers important for his defense, including information that
might be elicited when high government officials are questioned on
the witness stand.
   The secrets that the administration won't release include the
existence of covert intelligence operations and the location of
American hostages in the Middle East.
   Disclosure of such information could expose ``people in very
difficult situations to torture and death,'' Walsh said in court
last spring at the outset of the case.
   But the information also includes the well-publicized names of
Central American countries that helped assist the Contras as well as
nations, such as Saudi Arabia and South Korea, that were asked to
donate money to the rebel cause.
   The countries were referred to by letter or number during
congressional hearings on the Iran-Contra affair, but their names
became widely known.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the names of
countries were ``one of the minor categories,'' indicating the
administration might be more flexible about revealing their identity.
   Gesell has repeatedly expressed impatience with the idea of
showing jurors documents stripped of references to information that
has already leaked into the public domain.
   In advance of this week's hearings, Gesell directed Walsh to
devise an alternative to referring to the foreign countries by
letter, saying ``this masking technique appears unduly cumbersome.''
   The defense contends that referring to countries by numbers or
letters would create confusion and make it impossible to question
witnesses.
   Defense lawyers also want to disclose secrets to support North's
contention that he destroyed documents to prevent disclosure of
covert operations by members of Congress or other government
officials.
   North and his co-defendants _ former national security adviser
John M. Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakin and Richard Secord
_ are to be tried separately.

   Benjamin F. Schemmer, for 21 years the editor
of Armed Forces Journal International, said Friday he had resigned
his post in a dispute with the magazine's new owner.
   Schemmer said he submitted his resignation on Thursday,
specifying an effective date of Dec. 31.
   Schemmer sold the magazine last March to British publisher Robert
Maxwell, agreeing at the time to continue serving as editor and
announcing the new ownership would allow the magazine to expand its
international circulation.
   He said Friday his editorial independence at the magazine had
been maintained, but that Maxwell Communication Corp. had failed to
keep accurate financial records of the publication's performance.
   Donald L. Fruehling, the president of the Maxwell Pergamon
Publishing Group USA, did not immediately return a telephone call
seeking comment Friday.
   Schemmer said his future plans were still unclear.

<TEXT>
   The 60 seniors at Altamont High School are
skipping the annual class trip and donating their trip money to a
6-year-old leukemia victim, who needs $100,000 for a bone marrow
transplant.
   The seniors decided to give the $3,000 plus other funds they plan
to raise to Craig Grubaugh after hearing an emotional pitch from
Lynn Ingram, vice president of the local Jaycees, who went into the
classrooms to explain the youngster's plight.
   ``Her speech really got to you. There were a lot of tears,'' said
Johanna Smith, 17, secretary of the senior class in this central
Illinois town of 2,400 people. ``She told us that Christmas is a
time for giving and what better gift to give.''
   After Ms. Ingram's visit Tuesday, the subject turned to the
senior trip, said Matt Sager, 17, the senior class president.
   Donating money raised for the trip _ the destination had not been
decided _ provoked a ``lot of student discussion,'' Sager said, but
it was approved by a show of hands.
   ``There were one or two students who didn't like the idea, but
nobody spoke against it,'' he said.
   The seniors voted to give Craig all the proceeds from a spaghetti
supper planned to raise funds for the trip, plus other money set
aside for the traditional excursion.
   Principal Gene Logue praised the seniors, noting their action
ignited a flurry of fund-raising ideas.
   ``The school has exploded in the last two days,'' Logue said.
   Junior class president Doug Laatsch, 16, said his class decided
to donate money from a dance scheduled for Friday night. And all
four classes are competing in a ``Kiss The Pig'' contest _ the
teacher, community member and student who collect the most money for
the operation get the privilege of kissing a pig at an upcoming
basketball game.
   Craig's parents, Mike, 35, and Judy, 33, of Altamont, said their
insurer, Prudential Insurance Co., considers the bone marrow
transplant experimental and won't pay for it.
   The Grubaughs say they appreciate the seniors' sacrifice.
   ``I hate to see the students give up their class trip,'' said
Mrs. Grubaugh. ``We would like to see them hold the money out of the
fund until we get closer to the goal.''
   So far, the family has collected $16,000.
   Guidance counselor John Van Alst sent letters to parents seeking
their approval of the senior class' action.
   ``This is the kids' money (for the trip) but we wanted the
parents to be aware of what they had done,'' he said.
   About half of the parents have returned the letters; all favored
the seniors' decision.
   ``We are a poor community,'' Van Alst said, ``and if we pull it
off it will be a miracle. But then we all believe in miracles.''

<HEAD>Real Estate Mogul To Be Tour Guide For Gorbachev</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Multimillionaire developer Donald Trump will play
tour guide during Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's visit to
Trump's upscale retail mall next week, a Trump spokesman said Friday.
   Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, who will be in New York to meet
President Reagan and President-elect George Bush, are expected to
spend about a half-hour Thursday inside the marble-lined shopping
atrium on Fifth Avenue, said Trump spokesman Dan Klores.
   Due to security reasons, they may only get to browse through
stores on the first of the mall's six levels.
   But with stores like Cartier jewelers, Charles Jourdan shoes and
a Bonwit Teller department store, Gorbachev should come away with a
representative feeling of what upscale means.
   A large entourage of Soviet and U.S. security personnel and
reporters will join the tour.
   Trump, who lives on the top three floors of the 68-floor Trump
Tower, originally wanted to show the Soviet leader a large indoor
swimming pool in one of the top-priced tower apartments. But Klores
said that idea was scrapped because of time and security
restrictions.
   The meeting between the Soviet leader and one of America's
leading capitalists was arranged after Trump sent a letter to the
Soviet Embassy inviting Gorbachev to visit Trump Tower and the Plaza
Hotel, a recent Trump acquisition.
   Klores said Trump met Gorbachev at a White House dinner during
the Soviet leader's last visit to the United States. ``They spoke
and they got along, so when he knew Gorbachev was coming, he (Trump)
wrote him a note,'' Klores said.
   ``On Wednesday, the Soviets responded and said they'd be
delighted to come.''

   A historic agreement announced Friday gives
Ohio power to regulate the Energy Department's cleanup of a uranium
processing plant that has pumped 300,000 pounds of radioactive waste
into the environment.
   Ohio Attorney General Anthony Celebrezze Jr. and Sen. John Glenn,
D-Ohio, said the decree, negotiated by federal and state attorneys,
gives the state a court-enforceable order to pressure the department
to clean up the plant at an estimated cost of $1 billion.
   The accord covers the Feed Materials Production Center in
Fernald, which state officials blame for contamination of air and
water at the 1,050-acre site 18 miles north of Cincinnati. The plant
enriches uranium for nuclear power plants and for the government's
nuclear research efforts.
   Jim Alexander, spokesman for the Energy Department's Oak Ridge,
Tenn., operations, which include Fernald, said the agreement is
evidence of intent to clean up the plant. He said it is not intended
as an admission of wrongdoing.
   Joe La Grone, the DOE manager at Oak Ridge, said this week the
government will have spent $355 million by the end of fiscal 1989 on
cleanup and safety at Fernald.
   The plant sits above the Great Miami River aquifer, a water
source for 2 million people. The Energy Department has admitted that
the plant emitted radioactive uranium dust into the atmosphere over
three decades.
   Glenn said he hopes the court decree will prompt Congress to give
high priority to cleanup of 17 Energy Department plants nationwide.
   Stanley Chesley, a lawyer for neighbors who have a $300 million
class-action lawsuit pending against the plant said the settlement
does not compensate victims, give Ohio authority over radioactive
wastes stored at the plant or indicate whether the DOE has committed
the whole $1 billion.
   Chesley said he also is concerned that in exchange for the
agreement, the state agreed not to bring additional civil or
criminal lawsuits against the department and past or present plant
contractors and officials.
   He said his group will proceed with its lawsuit at a Dec. 16
hearing here.
   Marvin Clawson, a neighbor represented in the lawsuit, said the
agreement falls short of what the Energy Department should do.
   ``It mainly addressed the hazardous-waste problem, not the
radioactive waste problem,'' said Clawson, who lives four miles from
the plant. ``They've hardly admitted to anything yet.''
   The 37-year-old plant processes and molds uranium metal ingots
for use elsewhere in the Energy Department's production of nuclear
weapons. There has been no production at the site since union
workers went on strike Oct. 7.
   Energy Department officials have said they expect production to
resume when the strike ends.
   U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel signed the agreement and
also is presiding over the neighbors' lawsuit.
   The agreement resulted from two years of negotiations prompted by
two lawsuits, filed by the state in 1986 and 1987, against the
Energy Department. The decree requires the department to pay the
state about $1 million for penalties and to reimburse Ohio for
overseeing the cleanup, Celebrezze said.
   He said the agreement requires Fernald's current operator,
Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio, to pay $60,000 in penalties for
two releases of radioactive radon gas from concrete silos containing
radium wastes. It also requires National Lead of Ohio Inc., which
operated the plant until the end of 1985, to pay $275,000 for past
environmental problems.
   ``The decree also extends Ohio's jurisdiction over Fernald to all
state and federal hazardous-waste law and regulations,'' Celebrezze
said.
   ``This doesn't take away the federal pre-eminence in things
nuclear,'' Glenn said. ``But it does set a first in what any (state)
attorney general in the United States has been able to work out.''
   The Energy Department is assessing the future of Fernald and
other plants nationwide in a secret study to be completed this month.
   Westinghouse Materials Co. announced Thursday it will lay off 350
of the plant's 1,500 employees soon because of declining demand for
processed uranium. Glenn opposes closing the plant because he thinks
the cleanup would get a higher priority if it remains active.
   Glenn said Fernald's problems date through 35 years of
administrations and predecessors to the Energy Department, including
the Atomic Energy Commission and the Energy Research and Development
Administration.
   Ohio officials on Nov. 22 announced agreement with the DOE on a
$50 million cleanup of hazardous waste at a uranium enrichment plant
near Piketon, Ohio. In that settlement, the department also agreed
to be subject to Ohio environmental regulation. Celebrezze said the
details of the Piketon agreement remain to be incorporated into a
federal court consent decree. The matter of fines to be paid for
pollution vilaations at Piketon also is not yet resolved.

   A man accused of beating to death his adopted
daughter admitted knocking the 6-year-old girl to the floor the
night she was fatally injured, the man's former lover testified
Friday.
   ``I knocked her down and she didn't want to get up again. This
staring business had gotten to be too much for me,'' Hedda Nussbaum
said Joel Steinberg told her during a cocaine-smoking session a few
hours after the alleged assault.
   Nussbaum said Steinberg had angrily accused Lisa Steinberg in the
past of practicing ``a stare that was supposed to hypnotize the
person stared at.''
   Ms. Nussbaum, 46, is the key prosecution witness against
Steinberg. The disbarred lawyer is accused of beating Lisa on Nov.
1, 1987, six years after she was brought as a newborn to live in
their Greenwich Village apartment. She was taken to a hospital the
next day and later died of a brain injury.
   Steinberg has denied hitting Lisa.
   On her second day of testimony, Ms. Nussbaum said she once viewed
Steinberg as a ``godlike'' figure and tried to protect him when he
severely beat and brainwashed her.
   Ms. Nussbaum testified that she was cut off for years from her
family and friends. During one period, Steinberg forbade her from
leaving their apartment without permission; she lost her job as an
editor at Random House after repeatedly missing work because of
black eyes, she testified.
   ``That was the whole deal. They kept it so secret,'' Ms.
Nussbaum's sister, Judy Liebman, 48, said outside the courtroom,
explaining that their family had not known the extent of her
sister's problems.
   Ms. Nussbaum's testimony buttressed the prosecution's claim that
she was intimidated, injured and virtually brainwashed by Steinberg,
47.
   ``I was extremely attached to him. I thought he was the most
wonderful person I'd ever met and basically I worshiped him,
literally. (I) thought he had supernatural powers ... and healing
and a lot of godlike powers,'' she testified.
   She said she has come to realize through therapy that none of
that is true. She has spent the past year in physical and
psychological therapy, including several operations.
   While she had consulted psychiatrists and psychologists, Ms.
Nussbaum testified that ``Joel basically was acting as my therapist.
... I was very shy and I guess tense and he was trying to make me
more spontaneous, more natural, freer.''
   The death of little Lisa in an affluent, well-educated household
shocked many New Yorkers and led to a re-examination of the duty and
ability of neighbors, teachers and social workers to recognize and
report evidence of child abuse.
   Steinberg, charged with second-degree murder, says she fell
unconscious after choking on food and that he caused the bruises on
her chest and back while trying to revive her.
   Charges against Ms. Nussbaum were dropped.
   Police also found a 16-month-old boy the couple raised in their
apartment. The boy was returned to his natural mother.
   Asked about her relationship with Steinberg in late 1983 or early
1984, Ms. Nussbaum replied: ``At that time, he began beating me
severely.''
   Ms. Nussbaum said that on Feb. 18, 1985 _ one of six times she
tried to leave Steinberg _ she fled to a women's shelter but was
sent to Bellevue Hospital.
   Asked by doctors what had happened, she concocted two stories to
protect Steinberg: she had fallen down stairs, or she was homeless
and had been attacked by men on the street.
   When doctors pointed out old injuries on her X-rays, she told
them she had been a member of a sadomasochistic cult _ ``because I
believed it.''
   ``He would encourage me to come up with stories, fantasies, about
what happened. ... Since I had no actual memories of this myself, I
believed that I had some sort of an amnesia about it,'' she said.
   Once, she asked her father to come get her, but Steinberg walked
in while she was packing and ``he got violent with me. He threw me
to the floor. I hurt my leg.''
   When her father arrived, she told him everything was fine because
``I was afraid of Joel's reaction.''

<HEAD>Angola, South Africa Swap Charges on Peace Signing Delay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRAZZAVILLE, Congo (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angola and South Africa accused each
other Friday of delaying the signing of a long-awaited interim peace
agreement.
   But both sides left open the possibility that a dispute over
withdrawing 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola will be resolved under
U.S. mediation or will be shelved for later discussions, and that an
interim agreement will be signed.
   The tentative accord provides for the Cuban troop withdrawal and
for independence for South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.
   South African diplomat Glenn Babb told the British Broadcasting
Corp. that the signing was delayed because Angola and Cuba rejected
a U.N. proposal for monitoring the withdrawal of the Cubans.
   Babb, deputy director general of foreign affairs, said, however,
``We can perhaps overcome the problem of not having a final
verification document but that is still to be discussed here.''
   South African Foreign Minister Roelof Botha and Defense Minister
Magnus Malan flew to Brazzaville on Friday to join the talks.
   Cuban delegates told reporters South Africa insisted it be
allowed to join the team monitoring Cuban withdrawal. Cuba regards
this as unnecessary, saying the United States can monitor the
withdrawal and report to Pretoria.
   Chester Crocker, the U.S. diplomat leading the negotiations, has
made no comment on the dispute. Crocker, U.S. assistant secretary of
state for African affairs and architect of the peace plan, has
sought to induce South Africa to grant independence to Namibia by
persuading the Cubans to withdraw from Marxist Angola, the
territory's northern neighbor.
   Angolan rebels, meanwhile, vowed Friday to continue their 13-year
insurgency if the peace talks fail to result in negotiations between
the rebels and the Angolan government and a genuine withdrawal of
Cuban troops..
   The pledge by the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola came in a statement distributed in Lisbon, the capital of
Portugal.
   The anti-communist guerrilla group has fought the government of
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos since losing a civil war after
Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
   The guerrilla movement is not party to the talks among Angola,
Cuba and South Africa.
   In a separate statement, the rebels said they killed 53 soldiers
in clashes Wednesday in central Benguela province. They also claimed
guerrillas penetrated a Cuban military base near Huambo, 162 miles
south of the capital, Luanda, and destroyed fuel stored there.
   The Angolan newsagency ANGOP said troops killed 34 guerrillas in
fighting in Uige, Moxico and Huila provinces from Nov. 23-29 and
that the guerrillas group killed eight soldiers and 15 civilians
during the same period. It sdaid soldiers freed 52 people held by
the rebels.
   There was no independent confirmation of the reports.

   A high school class ring torn from the hand of
a Navy flier killed in a 1944 military plane crash in southern
California has been returned to the flier's family.
   A man whose stepson found the ring, during a hike last month to
the crash site atop Palomar Mountain in northern San Diego County,
flew to Minnesota with the ring Thursday.
   ``After I saw it was a class ring, I knew there would be somebody
out there who would dearly love to have it,'' said Ray Wilson, 54,
of Lakeside, Calif.
   Twelve men, including Clinton Baker of St. Cloud, Minn., died in
the May 30, 1944, collision between a B-24 bomber and a fighter
plane, both part of Navy 9th Patrol, according to records of the
Stearns County (Minn.) Historical Society.
   The ring was from St. Cloud Technical High School, Class of 1942.
   Baker enlisted in November 1942. He was 21 when he died.
   Wilson personally delivered the ring to Baker's younger brother,
Larry. ``I was just afraid it would get lost again,'' Wilson said,
explaining his lengthy trip.
   Larry Baker, 54, of Burnsville, and his wife, Sharon, 51, greeted
Wilson at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.
   ``How he tracked me and my family down was something,'' Baker
said.
   Wilson began a round of calls to the military and news media in
an effort to pinpoint the crash date and get a list of victims.
   Reporter John Hughes of the St. Cloud Times, contacted by Wilson,
learned from residents of Baker's wartime death. Hughes confirmed
details of the event with Bob Lommel, assistant archivist of the
Stearns County Historical Society, and then helped Wilson get in
touch with Larry Baker.
   Wilson had the ring carefully polished before giving it to the
Bakers.
   ``It's just as clear as a bell,'' Mrs. Baker said.
   ``Mom and dad did without so we could have rings,'' Baker said.
   ``I know it was a sacrifice for my mom and dad, too,'' said
Wilson, who added that he lost his own class ring while he was in
the Army.
   The Bakers plan to give the ring to their son, Clinton, 21, who
was named after his late uncle. ``He has everything else of his,''
Larry Baker said.

<TEXT>
   Ernest Ambler, the longtime director of the
National Institute of Standards and Technology, was chosen Friday to
be the first Commerce undersecretary for technology.
   Ambler, who plans to retire next year after 35 years of
government service, said he would serve in the new post only through
March in order to give the Bush administration a chance to name its
own choice for the job.
   The job of undersecretary for technology was created by Congress
this fall in a reorganization sought by Commerce Secretary C.
William Verity.
   In announcing Ambler's selection, Verity said he believed the
federal government needed to do more to focus attention on the
important role technological breakthroughs play in keeping America
competitive in global markets.
   ``Today's global market realities demand not only the creation of
new technologies, atwhich America continues to excel, but rapid and
continuous transfer of these technologies to new products,'' Verity
said.
   Verity said Ambler's first role would be to decide which Commerce
Department agencies to include under the umbrella of a new
Technology Administration.
   ``Since I took office 14 months ago, one of the recurring
comments I have heard from business leaders is that they don't know
where to go or whom to talk to in government about technology
advances or technology needs,'' Verity said. ``Legislative approval
means we can for the first time bring together the remarkable
scientific and technological resources of the Commerce Department.''

<HEAD>Buffalo FBI Agent Infiltrated Sicilian Crime Families</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DARREN DOPP</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The key to an FBI sting operation that led
to drug trafficking charges against more than 200 people was a savvy
undercover agent who knew the customs of Sicilian organized crime,
authorities said Friday.
   ``He was schooled in the rules of the Sicilian-Italian underworld
_ who to talk to and how to show respect to the elders. He was able
to gain the confidence of the Sicilian Mafia,'' said J. Ronnie Webb,
a supervisory agent in the FBI's Buffalo office.
   Authorities announced Thursday that they had smashed a major
heroin and cocaine ring by charging more than 200 people in the
United States and Italy, including Sicilian Mafia figures and
associates of the Gambino crime family in New York. Officials said
Friday that 60 people had been arrested in the United States and 24
in Italy, and the others were still being sought.
   Code-named BUSICO for Buffalo-Sicilian Connection, the FBI
operation got its start in 1983 during the arrest of Andrea Aiello
of Buffalo on charges of trying to import some 50 pounds of heroin.
At the time, it was called the largest heroin seizure ever in the
United States.
   In the course of the Aiello investigation, the undercover agent
learned of the desire by Sicilian crime figures to ship heroin to
the United States through Buffalo.
   Despite the attention the Aiello case drew, the Buffalo agent
remained undercover and was able to cultivate underworld contacts
for several years.
   Steven Naum, an FBI public affairs officer, said the agent, whose
identity is being kept secret, was skilled at passing himself as a
drug dealer.
   ``It was Acting 101 for him sometimes,'' Naum said.
   The investigation speeded up in 1985 with the so-called ``Pizza
Connection'' arrests in New York City and other cities. After that,
Webb said, the Sicilians considered New York ``too hot.''
   Buffalo was targeted by smugglers because it is close to Canada
and 400 miles away from New York City and its large number of
narcotics agents, authorities said.
   In the spring of 1986, the FBI set up a phony international
trading business, dubbed BSC Partake Wholesale, in a Buffalo suburb.
The idea was to import heroin concealed in jars of tomatoes and
olive oil.
   Although the operation never developed as a narcotics
distribution point, it did allow the undercover agent to broaden his
contacts among drug dealers in the United States and Italy.
   The agent went to Sicily, where he was able to win the confidence
of the Sicilian ``family'' running the smuggling operation.
   When he returned in 1987, BSC Partake Wholesale made ``dry run''
to test the route. The Sicilian organization sent the Hamburg
company 744 cases of tomatoes.
   In July, the cases of tomatoes arrived in Buffalo undisturbed.
FBI agents and local U.S. Customs agents had notified customs in New
York City, and officials quickly sent the shipment through, Webb
said.
   At the same time, undercover agents flew to Chicago, San
Francisco, New York City and Rockford, Ill. Using ties to the
Sicilian family, they met international drug smugglers with global
operations.
   ``The investigation mushroomed from there,'' Webb said.
   BUSICO spun off a number of undercover operations in other
cities, including New York, Philadelphia, Miami and Newark, N.J.
Authorities were reluctant in give details of those operations
because they were continuing.
   In New York, however, U.S. Attorney Rudolph Guliani said a
related investigation revealed that members of the Gambino crime
family were importing heroin in wine bottles from Sicily and
distributing it to buyers through pizza parlors.
   The Gambino organization swapped cocaine for the heroin. Cocaine
has a higher street value in Italy, Guliani said.
   The deal is evidence of the increasing role of the Mafia in
cocaine trafficking, he said. Previously, cocaine trafficking was
mainly the business of South American drug lords.

<HEAD>Body of Iran-Contra Figure Being Sent Home to Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ISAAC A. LEVI</BYLINE>

   A former Israeli government adviser who
allegedly played a role in the Iran-Contra affair was not on ``any
official business'' when he was killed in a plane crash in Mexico,
the Israeli Embassy said Friday.
   Amiram Nir was killed Wednesday while traveling under an assumed
name. Nir, 37, was a former conterterrorism adviser to Israel who
once briefed Vice President George Bush on secret arms sales to Iran.
   He was killed Wednesday when a Cessna T210 he had chartered
crashed at a ranch near Ciudad Hidalgo in Michoacan state, 110 miles
west of Mexico City. The pilot also was killed and three other
passengers were injured.
   Embassy spokesman Israel Mey-Ami said in a telephone interview:
``He was not here in any official business and he did not contact
the embassy. I don't know how long he was in this country, but it
musn't have been very long.''
   Mey-Ami said he went to Morelia, the Michoacan state capital, on
Thursday to get the body and bring it to Mexico City. He said it
would returned to Israel.
   Isauro Gutierrez Fernandez, a spokesman for the state attorney
general's office, said Nir was traveling under the name Pat Weber.
   Gutierrez said by telephone Thursday he did not know why Nir was
using as assumed name and Mey-Ami said he had no more details.
   Nir arrived in Mexico City on Sunday and traveled to Uruapan, 190
miles west, to stay with friends. ``it appears he had some possible
business involving shipments of products from Latin America to
Europe,'' Gutierrez said.
   Dov Schmorak, the Israeli ambassador, said in an interview on
Israel's army radio that Nir apparently missed a regularly scheduled
flight from Uruapan to Mexico City and hired a private plane.
   He quoted Mexican authorities as saying preliminary information
suggested the crash was caused by a rain storm.
   Lawrence E. Walsh, special prosecutor in the Iran-Contra case,
had sought Nir for questioning, but Israel insisted he be granted
immunity from prosecution so Nir never testified.
   Testimony given to U.S. congressional investigators said Nir was
an important liaison in secret arms deals involving the sale of U.S.
weapons to Iran.
   Former White House aide Oliver North suggested it was Nir's idea
to divert funds from the arms sales to Nicaraguan rebels. Israel has
denied it.
   Shimon Peres, now Israeli foreign minister, appointed Nir as his
adviser on counterterrorism in 1985 when he was prime minister and
assigned him to serve as liaison with North.
   Nir, a former journalist, met in Washington with North and Adm.
John Poindexter, President Reagan's national security adviser, in
January 1986 and proposed renewing arms shipments to Iran. At
meetings with North in Europe and Israel, he discussed shipping U.S.
arms through Israel and diverting profits to the rebels, known as
Contras.
   A ban by the Congress on military aid to the Contras was in force
at the time.
   The Israeli also accompanied North and Robert McFarlane, the
former national security adviser, to Iran in May 1986 to discuss the
release of American hostages held by pro-Iranian Lebanese in return
for Hawk wanti-aircraft Hawk missiles.
   On July 27, 1986, he briefed Bush on the program involving U.S.
weapons sales to Iran. Bush said he does not remember much about the
briefing, although his aide Craig Fuller attended the meeting and
took notes.
   Nir stayed on after Yitzhak Shamir succeeded Peres as prime
minister in October 1986 and the Iran-Contra affair exploded that
November. He resigned this year.

   For 8{ years, come rain or snow, Sen. William
Proxmire, D-Wis., and Labor Statistics Commissioner Janet L. Norwood
have met the first Friday of every month in the Dirksen Senate
Office Building for an economic tea dance. Much as he tried to set
the beat, she'd only waltz.
   They had their last session Friday, with the 73-year-old senator
holding his final hearing of the Joint Economic Committee of
Congress before retiring next month.
   As usual, Proxmire asked leading questions, attempting to get the
chief keeper of the nation's economic statistics to pooh-pooh the
rosy spin the administration puts on the employment figures each
month.
   With equal aplomb, Mrs. Norwood, a holdover appointee of former
President Jimmy Carter reappointed twice by President Reagan,
carefully phrased her answers to avoid any direct or implied
criticism of economic policymaking by the Presdent, the Congress or
the Federal Reserve Board.
   Addressing Mrs. Norwood for the last time as a member of the
committee in her 101st appearance before it, Proxmire said he
expected her usual ``public, truthful and unvarnished explanation''
of the November numbers.
   However, that did not prevent him from trying one last time to
get her critize the administration's latest and last economic
forecast of 3.5 percent growth, 3.7 percent inflation and a 5.2
percent unemployment rate for next year.
   ``I want to see if you can evade this question?'' he said,
referring in good humor to their past duels.
   Mrs. Norwood responded that with the labor force growing less
slowly, it will be easier for the nation to maintain lower
unemployment rates than in the past and that there really isn't much
evidence of any wage inflation.
   But she acknowledged that ``it will be very, very, very difficult
to achieve both'' a 5 percent unemployment rates and an inflation
rate declining to 1.5 percent by 1994 as the administration
forecasts.
   Proxmire began holding the hearings 17 years ago in response to
an order by President Nixon to the labor statistics commssioner at
the time, Geoffrey Moore, to quit giving the press briefings on the
numbers.
   If the labor statistics commissioner could not hold a press
conference to offer a ``truthful and unvarnished explanation'' of
the numbers, as Proxmire said at the time, then Congress would
compel it in the form of a hearing.
   While the only people in attendance normally are limited to
Proxmire, Mrs. Norwood, a few members of each's staff and a handful
of reporters, no force _ including the weather _ has been able to
get in their way since.
   Both usually hang around briefly upon the conclusion of the
hearings to answer questions from reporters on the numbers.
   A year ago, when the rest of the government was shut down by a
severe blizzard on an unemployment-report Friday, Proxmire jogged
through the snow to make the hearings and Mrs. Norwood spent the
preceding night in a hotel near the Capitol to make sure the weather
would not interfere with her attenndance.
   Other economists in the Bureau of Labor Statistic left their
homes at 4:30 a.m., some of them walking miles from the Virginia
suburbs to their offices, to make sure that experts who compiled the
report would be available to answer questions upon its release at
8:30 a.m.
   Both Proxmire and BLS officials said Friday they expect that
tradition to continue.
   ``This is very important to her,'' said Henry Lowenstern, an
assistant labor statistics commissioner. ``She really believes in
the need for a public forum.''
   Proxmire said he is sure that Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., now the
committee's chairman, will maintain the practice of the monthly
hearings.
   ``I think we have them pretty well established now,'' he said.

   The Soviet Union appealed Friday for an
international conference aimed at demilitarizing Afghanistan after a
decade of civil war, and said it hoped such a forum would lead to a
coalition government.
   ``The main thing is to involve an international mechanism in
Afghanistan for avoiding bloodshed in that country,'' Deputy Foreign
Minister Vladimir Petrovsky said at a news briefing.
   He said Yuli Vorontsov, first deputy foreign minister and
ambassador to Afghanistan, would fly to Saudi Arabia on Saturday to
meet with Burhanuddin Rabbani, current chairman of the Afghan
guerrilla alliance.
   Saudi officials arranged the meeting with the Afghanistan's
cooperation as a means of finding ``ways for an internal Afghan
settlement,'' he said, but added that it was not connected with an
international conference.
   Insurgent leaders said serveral says ago they would meet with
Vorontsov in Saudi Arabia this weekend.
   Petrovsky also said an international forum would not be related
to the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan under a
U.N.-mediated agreement signed April 14 in Geneva.
   The Soviets have suspended their withdrawal to protest continued
fighting by the U.S.-supported guerrillas, who were not parties to
the agreement and said when it was signed they would continue the
war.
   Moslem insurgents began fighting after a Communist coup in April
1978 and Soviet military forces entered Afghanistan in December
1979. An estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers were in the country when
the withdrawal began May 15.
   Half the Red Army troops were gone by Aug. 15, as stipulated in
the agreement, and the rest are to be out by Feb. 15, 1989.
   Petrovsky said the Soviet Union is urging the United Nations to
organize a conference as soon as possible. He set no conditions
about the participants or location.
   He said it was ``important that Afghanistan be represented at the
conference by a broadly based coalition government,'' which the
Afghan government has been trying to form. The guerrillas have
rejected the offer.
   ``We hope that this conference will help bring about a coalition
government,'' Petrovsky added.
   Afghanistan, Central America and the Middle East will be on the
agenda when President Mikhail S. Gorbachev meets with President
Reagan and President-elect George Bush next week, Petrovsky said.
   Gorbachev will be in New York to address the United Nations.
Petrovsky described the topic as ``the Soviet leadership's views on
major issues of world development.''
   The Soviet leader also will confer with Fidel Castro, the Cuban
president, in Havana and meet with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
in London. Petrovsky said all the meetings on Gorbachev's trip were
related.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Her election has been called a ``final crisis for
the church,'' but a clergywoman is quietly accumulating the votes to
become the first woman bishop in the worldwide Anglican communion.
   The Rev. Barbara C. Harris, elected Sept. 24 by the Boston
Episcopal diocese to serve as suffragan (assistant) bishop, already
has support from more than two-thirds of the 120 Standing Committees
needed to confirm her election, according to James Solheim, a
spokesman for the Boston diocese.
   Solheim said Harris also is expected to win the necessary support
from the Episcopal bishops, since the majority of them already
support women priests.
   But even her supporters acknowledge that Harris' consecration
promises to create a rift between conservative and liberal branches
that will test the unity of a church that has been known for its
ability to overcome divisive issues.
   Objections to Harris' election range from her gender to a
perception that she lacks sufficient training. Harris attended
Villanova University but has no degree. She studied theology through
correspondence courses and with tutors rather than attending a
seminary.
   ``The final crisis of the Episcopal Church is now upon us,''
began a pastoral letter from seven bishops of the Evangelical and
Catholic Mission, an Episcopal group that opposes female priests and
bishops.
   The bishops said elevating Harris to bishop would amount to
rejecting the image of God as a male ``in favor of a religiosity
tailored to human convenience.''
   The question bothering Harris' critics, Solheim said, has more to
do with the future unity of the church than with her own gender or
political views since some bishops say they will never support the
ordination of women.
   Such opposition in Massachusetts is minimal, said Jeffrey Penn, a
diocesan spokesman.
   Harris, 58, is refusing to comment publicly on the storm
surrounding her election until a majority of the standing committees
and Episcopal bishops give her their support, making the election
official.
   Some 1,200 women have been ordained since the Episcopal Church in
1976 decided to allow women priests. That decision paved the way for
female bishops, since all bishops must first serve as priests.
   The issue of women bishops is viewed more seriously because of
their powers to ordain priests and confirm believers. Harris would
become the first woman bishop in the historic apostolic succession,
a direct line of Christian hierarchy dating back to Jesus' apostles.
   Harris became a priest in Philadelphia in 1980 after a career in
corporate public relations. Most recently she has headed the
Episcopal Church Publishing Co. that produces The Witness, a liberal
church publication.
   In a compromise measure in July, the Episcopal Church's governing
convention in Detroit approved a measure allowing any congregation
rejecting a woman bishop to petition for a male ``Episcopal
visitor'' bishop to administer confirmations.
   
   But the woman bishop still would make the periodic pastoral
visits required by church law, even to congregations rejecting women
bishops.

   Fourteen months ago they wed in a
fairy-tale ceremony at an Alpine castle. On Friday, one of Europe's
aristocratic young couples was buried _ the princess a victim of an
apparent drug overdose, her prince driven to suicide.
   Mourned by 150 noble relatives, Prince Ludwig Rudolf of Hanover,
a 33-year-old great-grandson of Germany's last emperor, and his
26-year-old bride, Isabelle, were laid to rest in a driving frozen
rain in the village of Gruenau, 120 miles west of Vienna.
   Among the mourners at a Mass in the whitewashed village church
were the prince's aunt, Princess Sophie of Greece, sister of Queen
Elizabeth II's husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, and four members of
Austria's deposed House of Hapsburg.
   The ceremony made no mention of how they died. With similar
restraint, none of the noble houses that sent about 40 wreaths to
the funeral signed their family names. At least two wreaths bore a
royal crown.
   The funeral came 14 months after a lavish five-day wedding in the
Alpine castle of Bleiburg in southern Austria, home of the bride,
Countess Isabelle von Thurn.
   Five months later, as the Austrian tabloid Kurier respectfully
phrased it, Isabelle ``made a gift'' of a son, Otto, to her husband.
   On Sunday night, the princely pair again made news. This time, it
was gruesome.
   After dining with an obscure West German pop group and an
unidentified American, Isabelle retired to her bedroom in the
couple's home, the so-called ``Queen's Villa'' in Gmunden, 150 miles
west of the capital.
   Several hours later, the prince found his wife dead on the bed
from what police said was apparently a drug overdose, probably
cocaine. The prince, who was ``in shock,'' drove from the house and
shot himself in a nearby forest of the Almtal valley, his family
said.
   The couple's grisly end has dented popular images of aristocrats
embodying the vanished glory of the still-beloved Hapsburg monarchy,
forced to abdicate in 1918 at the end of World War I.
   Ever since the deaths became known Monday, newspapers in Austria
and West Germany have painted a different picture of what Kurier on
Friday sardonically labeled ``high society.''
   Reporters trying to learn more about the dead couple got little
out of aristocrats at fashionable Vienna nightspots. Few admitted to
knowing the pair, and none discussed the use of what Germans often
call the ``noble drug'' _ cocaine, which is blamed here for a record
number of fatal overdoses this year.
   Such silence reportedly hampers police tracking well-born drug
offenders.
   ``There are barriers we simply can't cross,'' Salzburg narcotics
detective Karl Walder told Kurier.
   Police insisted on anonymity this week when revealing that old
needle marks were found on the arms of the royal couple and used
syringes were confiscated from their home.
   ``I don't want to burn my fingers,'' said one police official.
   A preliminary autopsy on the princess showed she died of heart
and lung edema, or swelling from an abnormal accumulation of fluid,
apparently caused by a cocaine overdose. Asked if more autopsy tests
would be made public, an official at a local state prosecutor's
office voiced relief no trial would be necessary.
   ``Death ends all punishment,'' he noted, demanding anonymity.
   Prince Ludwig Rudolf was no stranger to the courtroom. In 1981,
according to press reports reluctantly confirmed by Munich state
prosecutors, he testified at a drug trial that also involved Rainer
Werner Fassbinder, the West German film director who died after a
cocaine overdose in 1982.
   Asked why he transferred some $20,000 to the account of a
suspected cocaine dealer, the prince reportedly told the Munich
court the money was to pay for a car.
   Last week, state prosecutors in the West German city of Hanover
closed another drug trafficking investigation against the prince for
lack of evidence.
   Word that the investigation was dropped apparently had not
reached the prince when he shot himself, Hanover prosecutor's
spokesman Klaus Ramberger said.
   Newspapers have speculated this may have increased the panic the
prince felt when he found his wife dead at 2:45 a.m. Monday.
   Ludwig Rudolf quickly alerted the Red Cross, telling them in a
telephone call that his wife might have taken cocaine.
   Police later tested the other guests at the villa for drug abuse
and pronounced them clean.
   But the prince reportedly did not wait even for the emergency
doctor to arrive to examine his wife before leaving the villa,
taking a hunting gun.
   According to press reports based on police sources, he did call
his brother in London, Prince Ernst August of Hanover, telling him
of his suicide plans and asking him to take care of his baby son.
   The line to London then went dead. Police alerted to look for
Ludwig Rudolf failed to find him before a forest worker discovered
his body slumped across the steering wheel of his car, with a bullet
wound to the head.

   Police seized two children from a
courthouse while their mother was inside testifying before a grand
jury about allegations that she tried to sell one of them for
cocaine.
   ``I didn't know what was going on,'' said Rhonda Romero. ``I walk
outside and my kids are gone. They told me I'd sold him for 2 ounces
of cocaine. This is ridiculous.''
   Ms. Romero was testifying before the Nueces County Grand Jury on
Thursday when police took the children, 1 and 2 years old.
   Police did not have a court order to seize the boys, but the
Texas Family Code says a court order is not necessary if there is
``immediate danger to the physical health or safety of the child and
there is no time to obtain a temporary restraining order,'' said
District Attorney Grant Jones.
   Jones said the grand jury is investigating the ``sale or
attempted sale'' of a child.
   Ms. Romero said she is unemployed and could not care for the
children properly, so she was trying to find them decent homes. The
older boy was staying with another couple but that she did not trade
the child for drugs.
   The grand jury was to continue hearing testimony in the case.
   The children will be supervised by the Texas Department of Human
Services until a court hearing within 10 days determines who should
care for them.

   At least one assassin with a silenced
pistol slipped into a guarded hospital room Friday and killed a
Moslem suspected in a fatal car bombing, police reported.
   They identified the dead man as Mahmoud Ahmed, a 25-year-old
Lebanese.
   Authorities arrested him after a car bomb exploded Sept. 28 at a
Syrian army checkpoint on the coastal highway south of Beirut. Five
people were killed and 21 wounded, included five Syrian soldiers.
   Ahmed was hit in the stomach by shrapnel and was undergoing
treatment at the American University Hospital in Moslem west Beirut,
police said. They said two plainclothes Syrian agents had guarded
him the 8th-floor room around the clock.
   ``We do not know how the assassin or assassins managed to slip
into the guarded room and shoot him,'' said a police spokesman who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We believe a silencer-equipped
pistol was used.''
   A hospital spokesman confirmed the killing but gave no details.

<TEXT>
   Soviet and American delegates to an Emerging
Leaders Summit heard letters Friday from Mikhail Gorbachev and
President-elect George Bush, who said world peace could be developed
through better understanding.
   ``You are the leaders of tomorrow,'' Bush said in a letter read
during a plenary session that opened the week-long conference.
   The conference has 340 delegates, most of them in their 20s and
30s, from the two nations.
   Gorbachev, originally expected to attend the conference as part
of his visit to the U.S. next week to address the United Nations,
sent a letter that echoed Bush's.
   ``Your forum is a sign of real changes for the better in the
world,'' Gorbachev said. ``It's your mission to advance history, to
write its new pages and chapters. You are to carry the burden and
beauty of insuring conclusively that it will be no longer be written
by the sword and the yoke.''
   Viktor Mironenko, 35, first secretary of the Communist Youth
League, a member of the Supreme Soviet Presidium and head of the
Russian delegation, took up the theme.
   Referring to Philadelphia's role in U.S. history and the writing
of the Constitution, Mironenko said the challenges today's delegates
face are even tougher because they are more complex.
   ``Each generation of humans takes one or more steps toward making
the world free of wars and aggression. We are striving ahead (even
though) our world is far from perfect. But we have to live in this
world together,'' he said.
   Alluding to Gorbachev's current ``glasnost'' reforms, Mironenko
said: ``we have come to the conclusion that it is open-ness not
close-ness that makes society strong.''
   Sixteen delegate commissions will cover major topics affecting
the two world powers _ government and political affairs,
international business and trade, youth work and social service,
domestic and international law, military, media, religion, labor and
management, education, global environment, international finance,
science and technology, medicine and health care.
   Each commission has scheduled seven three-hour sessions during
the week.
   ``We must understand each other better because it will help world
peace,'' said Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., applauding Gorbachev's
efforts to democratize Soviet government. ``It is a very healthy
sign.
   ``As we view democracy in the changing Soviet Union we are more
impressed by the dissents than the agreements.''
   There will be daily updates on each commission's discussions,
which are closed to the public and to reporters. At the end of the
summit next week, delegates will compile ``The Final Appeal,'' a
document outlining strategies for improved relations between the
superpowers.
   Philip Hughes, assistant secretary of commerce in the Reagan
adminstration, told delegates there is world confusion ``on what
Gorbachev represents. Does he want to make the Soviet Union stronger
in the world community or is he really seeking change.
   ``Then there is skepticism. The alienation between the U.S. and
Soviet Union has existed for so long that many Americans are
skeptical whether any new leader can make any change permanent,''
Hughes said.
   American Rabbi Gary Zola, 32, of Cincinnati, said he expected the
religious sessions will touch on ``human rights, freedom of religion
and, of course, Soviet Jews.''
   ``That means bilateral relations, humanitarian issues, regional
conflicts,'' said Sergei Chelnokov.
   Chelnokov is head of the Soviet Committee of Youth Organizations,
which is co-sponsoring the meeting with the American Council of
International Leadership.
   In addition to the formal meetings, the delegates will have
sightseeing, lunches at various educational institutions and dinners
at homes, and on Saturday the Army-Navy football game.

   Villagers set out Friday to rebuild
homes and businesses flattened by a cyclone earlier this week that
left at least 787 people dead and 3,250 missing.
   ``I have lost everything: my home, my crops, my cattle,'' said
Ahmed Ali, a 45-year-old farmer who found temporary shelter in a
school building with his wife and five children in a school
building. ``There is no future for me and my family.''
   Dainik Bangla, an independent newspaper, said more than 10,000
people were injured and 5 million left homeless.
   The storm hit southern Bengladesh and eastern India on Tuesday
with winds of up to 102 mph and 15-foot waves that flooded coastal
islands and sandbars inhabited by fishermen and peasants.
   It mowed down utility poles and palm trees, killed thousands of
cattle and devastated rice paddies ready for harvest.
   Not a single mud-and-straw house was left standing in Shamnagar,
a town of 6,000 people where 10 people were killed.
   Rahmat Ali, 28, said he borrowed the equivalent of $16 from his
wife's parents to buy bamboo and straw to rebuild his grocery store
in the marketplace.
   ``The winds came howling late in the evening and continued until
midnight,'' he said. ``Next morning, my shop and whatever little was
there was swept away by the cyclone.''
   Dozens of other southern villages suffered similar fates.
   Official reports said 577 people were killed but that estimate is
considered conservative. The Red Crescent Society, the Moslem
equivalent of the Red Cross, said 806 people died, mostly in the
southwestern districts of Khulna, Satkhira and Bagerhat, and the
independent Khabar newspaper put the death toll at 1,050.
   The Red Crescent also said more than 3,000 were still missing,
mostly fishermen.
   In the Indian city of Calcutta, police sources said 210 people
had died in West Bengal state next to Bangladesh. Indian news
agencies, however, said the death toll was 500, with at least 250
people reported missing.
   The death toll has not approached from a 1970 cyclone that
claimed at least 300,000 lives.
   Tuesday's cyclone struck while Bangladesh was recovering from
summer floods that inundated three-fourths of the country and killed
at least 1,500 people.

   China claimed Friday that Indian planes had
intruded into its air space, but gave no details in a statement.
   India said it was not aware of any intrusions and indicated the
matter would not interfere with Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's plans
to visit Beijing this month, the first trip to China by an Indian
prime minister since 1954.
   China and India fought a brief border war in 1962 and relations
have remained tense. There have been intermittent accusations by
both sides of border violations.
   The Chinese Foreign Ministry statement Friday said, ``Recently
Indian planes have indeed intruded into China's air space. The
Chinese side has made representations to the Indian side.''
   The statement was issued in response to a question by the British
Broadcasting Corp., which said a Chinese source reported border
violations by India.
   A spokesman for the Indian Foreign Ministry in New Delhi said,
``We have checked with the Defense Ministry and are not aware of any
violations. Do not read too much into the matter. Preparations for
the prime minister's visit are ... going very well.''

<HEAD>Bush Meets Robertson, Dukakis, Says Friendships Survive Campaigns</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 21st graf pvs, bgng: ``Bush began ...'' to show Alfonsin
meeting took place.
^By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush and Michael Dukakis, formerly
bitter rivals, met cordially Friday though Dukakis resorted to
campaign rhetoric in warning ``the chickens are coming home to
roost'' from Republican economic policies.
   Bush, who defeated the Democratic governor of Massachusetts for
the presidency on Nov. 8, said the post-election visit was ``in the
finest tradition of American politics.''
   The president-elect, who instigated the meeting, said, ``I want
to express my appreciation to Governor Dukakis for coming our way.
We had good discussion of the issues that are facing the country in
a spirit of good will.''
   Dukakis also called it a good discussion. He offered no judgment
on Bush's early transition moves, saying, ``The real test will come
when the new administration is fully formed and begins to move
forward with its priorities.''
   The vice president-elect, Dan Quayle, often the object of
Dukakis' scorn during the campaign, greeted him inside the vice
president's residence, along with James Baker III, Bush's campaign
manager and his choice for secretary of state. Both left before
Bush's 35-minute meeting with Dukakis.
   After the visit, the two stepped out without topcoats into the
brisk afternoon for a brief word with reporters.
   Dukakis, who earlier Friday made a series of calls on the
Democratic leaders of Congress, said he and Bush ``talked about the
future. I expressed my concern obviously about the deficit'' and
some of the issues the Democrats campaigned on _ better health care,
housing, education and the environment.
   He said he didn't bring up the negative tenor of the campaign.
``We had a good, tough campaign. That's behind us,'' Dukakis said.
``The question now is how do we build a good country.''
   The governor joked that he was hesitant to offer Bush advice on
the deficit given his own problems with his state's budget. But then
he said in earnest that the country faces ``a very formidable
challenge. We've had eight years of endless borrowing and spending
and the chickens are coming home to roost.''
   He said, ``The vice president is anxious to learn and listen and
reach out and that's a good thing.''
   Bush left him with a seasonal wish: ``God bless you and have a
great Christmas.''
   Earlier, Bush met at the White House with a former GOP rival, Pat
Robertson, and spoke of ``the wonderful way'' that friendships
survive campaign battles.
   Robertson, who returned last week from South Africa, gave Bush an
upbeat report on racial progress in the white-ruled country and said
Bush told him he wished Jesse Jackson and other black American
leaders would visit South Africa and ``explore firsthand what's
happening because there have been some significant changes over the
last 10 years.''
   On another subject, as Bush's presidential transition efforts
moved closer to the Jan. 20 inauguration, the vice president
expressed chagrin at reporters' questions about why he made no
additions to his Cabinet this week.
   ``There's no holdup. We're way ahead of schedule,'' he said,
complaining about ``early, premature, needless speculation.''
   At the outset of the meeting with Robertson, Bush said, ``Some
people don't understand the campaign. They think that when you run
against someone in a campaign, that that injures friendships.''
   Citing earlier sessions with Democratic leaders, including
Jackson, Bush said, ``That's not true. It's wonderful the way the
American political system works.''
   Robertson, a longtime critic of sanctions against South Africa's
government, said he gave Bush a private message from that nation's
foreign minister about the situation in Angola in southern Africa
and the proposed withdrawal of Cuban troops there.
   ``The time has come to recognize the South African government
needs a little encouragement,'' said the conservative television
evangelist. He cited as positive steps the government's movement
from prison to a halfway house of Nelson Mandela and the commutation
of death sentences for the Sharpeville Six.
   Robertson said he had spoken with black mayors in Soweto.
``Seventy-five percent of the black people in South Africa are
saying, `Please, we don't want sanctions and disinvestment because
they are falling most severely on the poor blacks of South
Africa,''' he said.
   Bush began his day meeting with Bermuda Premier John Swan and
ended it with a courtesy call from Argentine President Raul
Alfonsin, who had reports of a mutiny by army troops back in Buenos
Aires to worry about.
   The president-elect also was meeting a group of evangelical
leaders.
   Bush was asked if he had a place in his Cabinet for Robertson.
``Just good friend,'' the television evangelist interjected.
   Bush, who reviled Dukakis during the campaign as ``another
liberal governor coming out of nowhere,'' made clear immediately
after the election that he hoped to bury the hatchet as quickly as
possible.

<HEAD>U.S. Embassy Says Details Remain Unsolved in Amerasian Accord</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Vietnamese officials discussed
for opening an office to process Amerasians seeking to emigrate to
the United States, but did not reach agreement, a U.S. Embassy
official said Friday.
   Vietnamese government spokeswoman Ho The Lan reported that an
agreement resulted from the meeting Wednesday in Hanoi, but Bangkok
embassy spokesman Ross Petzing said: ``The discussions were useful
and constructive. No final agreement has been reached yet and some
details remain to be worked out.''
   Since a regular emigration program began in 1982, the United
States has taken about 5,000 Amerasians, children fathered by
Americans during the Vietnam War. U.S. forces withdrew from the
conflict in 1973.
   Officials estimate 8,000-12,000 Amerasians remain in Vietnam. The
Vietnamese have said a processing center in Ho Chi Minh City,
formerly Saigon, is needed to expedite their departure.
   Hanoi's official Vietnam News Agency said Foreign Ministry
representative Le Bang and Bruce Beardsley, head of the refugee
office of the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, discussed the issue in the
Vietnamese capital.
   Its report quoted Mrs. Lan as telling a news conference Thursday
the two sides agreed to reach quick solutions to technical problems,
including air transportation.
   ``At the same time, they agreed to set up an Amerasian center in
Ho Chi Minh City and put it into operation soon,'' she said, without
giving details.
   The United States and Vietnam have no diplomatic relations
because of U.S. opposition to the decade-old Vietnamese occupation
of Cambodia. Hanoi has repeatedly pressed for establishing offices
to deal with Vietnamese-U.S. humanitarian issues.
   ``Vietnam has supplied the U.S. side with a list of Amerasians
and their relatives and urged the U.S. side to simplify the
procedures and quickly take them to the United States in a two-year
period beginning from March 1988,'' Mrs. Lan said.
   She said the two countries will conduct their third joint field
investigation in Vietnam from Dec. 5-15 to account for American
servicmen missing in action, or MIAs.
   The number of joint search teams will be increased from two to
four, she said. A total of 1,757 Americans still are listed as
missing in the Indochina war, which ended in April 1975.

<TEXT>
   Six Contra supporters accused of
attacking Nicaragua urged a judge Friday to dismiss their case on
the grounds the United States has been waging a de facto war against
the Sandinistas.
   They asked U.S. District Judge Norman C. Roettger to throw out an
indictment accusing them of violating the U.S. Neutrality Act by
recruiting mercenaries and launching operations against the
Sandinista government in Nicaragua from U.S. soil in 1985.
   ``This is a ludicrous thing,'' said defendant Mario Calero,
brother of top Contra leader Adolfo Calero. ``There has not been a
violation of the Neutrality Act. The executive branch was funding
and directing the war.''
   Adolfo Calero testified Friday that the rebels continued to
receive U.S. aid, such as private contributions funneled through
then-White House aide Oliver North, even during the time that
Congress cut off military funds.
   In testimony reminiscent of what he told the Iran-Contra
investigations, he said North and other government officials never
advised him to cease his activities because of the congressional
action.
   ``It was the opposite,'' said the Contra leader. ``We were told
not to give up, to continue the struggle.''
   After the day's testimony, Roettger continued the pretrial
hearing until Jan. 5 and said he would rule on the dismissal motion
shortly thereafter.
   The Neutrality Act forbids private citizens from launching
U.S.-based military operations against any nation with which the
nation is at peace.
   The defendants won a quick procedural victory when Roettger
brushed aside the U.S. attorney's efforts to delay arguments on the
issue until trial.
   Just before the noon recess, Roettger agreed to take more
testimony, and warned prosecutors that he expected to look broadly
at the war and peace issue.
   At one point, the judge also expressed impatience with the
prosecution's contention that the only purpose of U.S. aid to the
Nicaraguan Contras was to interdict arms to leftist rebels in nearby
El Salvador.
   Referring to President Reagan, the judge said: ``I remember a
badge that said `I'm a Contra too.' It didn't say anything about
interdicting arms.''
   The judge sharply questioned Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric
Dubelier on whether the government contends it was at peace with
Libya when U.S. Navy jets attacked Tripoli in 1986.
   Dubelier conceded the U.S. was not at peace with Libya in that
case, but asked in return, ``Where do you draw the line?''
   If the defense's line of reasoning was accepted, Dubelier said,
``then the Neutrality Act could not be used now against anyone
preparing to invade the Soviet Union.''
   The group was indicted in June after charges of Reagan
administration foot-dragging. Opponents of aid to the Contras
accused former Attorney General Edwin Meese III of stalling the case
because it threatened to uncover North's involvement.
   The indictment accused the Contra supporters of recruiting and
training mercenaries to fight with Contras, supplying them with
equipment, leading them on expeditions, including one aimed at
blowing up a Nicaraguan bridge, and violating firearms laws.
   The seven original defendants were Thomas Posey, head of the
Alabama-based Civilian Materiel Assistance group; Mario Calero, a
former supply manager for the rebels; Joe Adams, Adolfo's former
bodyguard; Jack Terrell, a former mercenary who turned against the
effort and went to authorities; Maco Stewart, a wealthy former Texas
businessman and state official who now lives in France; Jose Coutin,
a Civilian Materiel Assistance liaison in Florida; and Alex
Martinez, a conservative Cuban-American stockbroker.
   Stewart allegedly financed some of the activities.
   Some of the defendants, including Terrell and Posey, have
produced documents showing the FBI and other agencies were aware of
their activities in aiding the Contras, and have said knowledge of
their activities went all the way to the White House.
   But Adams decided to plead guilty and received a sentence of a
$50 fine and one day of probation. The other six defendants continue
to fight the charges.
   Terrell, who faces a possible 33-year jail sentence, was accused
of buying a Manlicher .308-caliber rifle to be used as a sniper
weapon in Nicaragua.
   Coutin faces 13 years if convicted because he allegedly gave his
passport to a mercenary, while the rest face up to eight years on
two Neutrality Act violations.
   A second Neutrality Act indictment returned by the same grand
jury accuses six more men of running a training camp for the
Contras, as well as supplying them with weapons that included a 20mm
cannon. That case is being heard by a different judge.

   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
criticized Belgium's premier Friday for refusing to extradite a
pro-IRA priest, a dispute that overshadowed a European Economic
Community summit meeting.
   In the some of the angriest exchanges reported between leaders in
the trade bloc, Mrs. Thatcher told Premier Wilfried Martens of
Belgium that she was ``mystified and deeply wounded'' by his
government's refusal to extradite Patrick Ryan.
   British police suspect the Roman Catholic priest of involvement
in a series of Irish Republican Army bombings and other terrorist
offenses.
   Soon after the angry meeting in Mrs. Thatcher's hotel suite, she
and Martens sat side-by-side as the leaders of the 12-nation
community reviewed their ambitious program to dismantle all trade
barriers and create by 1992 a single market of 322 million people.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who has been criticized for being wary of the
trade agreement, argued during the afternoon meeting that some
border restrictions must remain in place to control terrorism, drug
dealing and arms smuggling, officials said.
   ``Insular thinking ... is a reality,'' Dutch Prime Minister Ruud
Lubbers said of Mrs. Thatcher. ``But I have never seen her more
relaxed. She sees this summit ... as the start of a debate,'' he
told reporters after the three-and-a-half hour session.
   The two-day meeting among the often-quarrelsome European leaders,
which began Friday, had been expected to produce few problems. Tough
decisions on closer union, including monetary cooperation and a
single tax system, are due at the next six-monthly summit in Spain.
   Central to the informal agenda was a draft statement aimed at
reassuring the United States and Japan that the community will not
shut out their trade in 1992.
   ``Europe will not close in on itself ... will not be a Fortress
Europe, but a partnership,'' the draft said.
   The leaders met in the 14th century Knights of St. John castle on
the island. A frigate patrolled offshore and commandos armed with
automatic weapons patrolled the beachfront.
   In the early hours Friday, four bombs exploded in Athens, 270
miles west of the meeting site, including one at an EEC building.
Police said no one was injured.
   The left-wing Revolutionary Popular Struggle, which has claimed
responsibility for more than 500 previous attacks in the past 15
years, said in a message to Greek newspapers that it planted the
devices.
   The priest was arrested in Belgium last summer. Last week,
Martens' government turned down the British extradition request and
sent him to Ireland. Ireland says it is considering the request,
though authorities no longer know where he is.
   Martens said after meeting Mrs. Thatcher that he told her the
extradition request was rejected because it was legally flawed.
   ``It was not a political decision,'' Martens said.
   A British spokesman said Mrs. Thatcher told Martens she was
``mystified and deeply wounded and (spoke) of confidence being
undermined.''

<HEAD>Company Pleads Guilty To Assisting In Filing False Tax Return</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A California company pleaded guilty Friday to
assisting in the filing of a false tax return by a businessman tied
to corruption in the Philippines under former President Ferdinand
Marcos.
   Ocean Applied Research Corp. of San Diego entered the plea in
U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va., the Justice Department said.
   The company, which was fined $10,000 and paid $38,258 to settle
civil claims, aided Raymond M. Moreno in preparing and filing the
false tax return for Moreno's company, Amworld Inc., according to
the government.
   Moreno, who was closely associated with former Philippines Gen.
Fabian C. Ver, chief of the armed forces under Marcos, pleaded
guilty on Dec. 14, 1987, in an alleged $6.8 million kickback scheme
involving a Philippine military communications system.
   A U.S. arrest warrant was issued some time ago for Ver and still
is outstanding, a Justice Department official, Theodore Greenburg,
said in an interview.
   At the time Moreno pleaded guilty, the Justice Department said
that after Moreno's companies won three contracts totaling $28
million in 1983 to modernize the Philippine military communications
system, seven American firms were subcontractors to Moreno and paid
him $6.8 million in kickbacks. The modernization effort took place
under the Pentagon's foreign military program.
   Court papers filed in the OAR case say that the firm was a
subcontractor to Amworld in the Philippines communications system
modernization program. Moreno, said the court papers, awarded a
subcontract to OAR in 1983 when the company agreed to pay a kickback
which eventually totaled $658,093 to Moreno through a Hong Kong
shell company, Geomanagement Ltd., also owned by Moreno.
   OAR provided Amworld with an invoice reflecting twice the actual
sales price of goods. Moreno used the inflated invoice furnished by
OAR to fraudulently boost Amworld's business expenses on its 1983
corporate income tax return, the Justice Department papers said.

   The Beatty United Methodist Church is
returning 110 acres of land taken from the Klamath Indians in the
1920s.
   ``I feel really good about United Methodist doing this,'' said
Charles Kimbol, chairman of the tribe. ``I think it was really a
fine gesture on their part.''
   A ceremony will be held Sunday at the church, located in the tiny
communty of Beatty about 35 miles northeast of Klamath Falls.
   The land was deeded to the church by President Warren Harding in
the 1920s. It was originally part of the Klamath Reservation, which
covered 1.1 million acres before the tribe was dissolved by federal
decree in 1954. The Klamaths were restored to tribal status in 1986.
   The church will retain five acres on which the church stands.
   The Klamaths currently have about 200 acres of land, mostly
Indian cemeteries scattered around the area, Kimbol said.
   The tribe hasn't decided what to do with the land yet, but is
putting together plans for economic development, Kimbol said. About
60 percent of the 1,200 tribal members in Klamath County are
unemployed, he added.
   Housing or a community center for about 25 tribal members living
in Beatty are possibilities, Kimbol said.
   The idea of returning the land came from the Revs. Kevin and
Carol Seckel, who ministered at four United Methodist churches in
rural Klamath County a few years ago, said Patricia Davidson, a
former lay minister at the Beatty church and a member of the Klamath
tribe.
   ``The Indians didn't realize it was there,'' she said.
   The idea was approved by church leaders and the church's annual
conference, she added.
   As older members have died or moved away, the congregation of the
Beatty church has dwindled, to the point where as few as three
people sometimes attend services, Davidson said.
   She said as many as 200 people were expected to attend Sunday's
ceremony.
   ``I don't know how they're going to get them all in the church,''
she said.

<TEXT>
   A former volunteer firefighter accused of
setting 14 blazes in a town that was terrorized by arson for several
months pleaded innocent Friday as his lawyer said authorities have
``the wrong man.''
   Lance Lalumiere, 23, stood silent during a brief hearing in the
Coos County Courthouse as his lawyer entered innocent pleas to 14
counts of arson and two of attempted arson.
   The series of 26 fires in and near Jefferson, a town of 850 near
here, began in May and continued through early October. No one was
killed, though there were close calls.
   Lalumiere was arrested Oct. 12 and has been held without bail
since them. He was first charged with setting a fire in his
brother's cabin in August, and then was later charged with 15 other
arsons or arson attempts.
   The attorney general's office has said that Lalumiere admitted
setting 16 fires. Court documents show that authorities found a
hand-drawn map of several arson sites in Lalumiere's trailer and a
propane-type torch in a car he owned.
   But after Friday's hearing, his lawyer, James Quay, said, ``The
police have arrested the wrong man.''
   ``Lance has appeared in court today and affirmed his innocence as
to each and every one of these charges,'' Quay said. ``We deny all
of the assertions contained in each of these charges.''
   In addition, he said, many townspeople quoted in news reports
since the arrest said Lalumiere couldn't have set the fires.
   Another man has been charged in connection with one of the 26
fires, and authorities say the other nine are still under
investigation.

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission on
Friday fined operators of the Palo Verde nuclear power plant
$250,000 for violations that included one worker's exposure to
radiation.
   The Arizona Nuclear Power Project, which operates the plant for a
consortium of utilities in Arizona, California, New Mexico and
Texas, said it would not contest the penalties by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.
   ``The violations resulted from problems we identified and
reported to the NRC. We take the infractions very seriously,'' said
Don Karner, ANPP executive vice president.
   The NRC's regional office in Walnut Creek, Calif., said the
violations included a worker exceeding his radiation exposure limit,
part of a reactor unit's air conditioning system being rendered
inoperable inadvertently ``and a radiation oversight committee not
fulfilling its reponsibilities.''
   Palo Verde operators recently announced they plan to spend
millions of dollars improving the plant, including hiring dozens of
additional engineers to act as troubleshooters, revamping the duties
of work crews and retaining consultants.
   Palo Verde, a three-reactor plant, is located about 50 miles west
of downtown Phoenix.
   The NRC previously has imposed several penalties against Palo
Verde, including $50,000 for deficiencies with a radiation sampling
system, $100,000 in May 1986 for security deficiencies and $100,000
in April for engineering and and operations problems.
   Other problems have included numerous unplanned shutdowns this
year for Palo Verde's Unit 1, which operated at 52.1 percent of
capacity this year. Units 2 and 3 operated at 56.3 percent and 90.5
percent, respectively.

   A 59-year-old man whose emaciated body was

   The body of Robert Jorgensen was found Thursday. Health officials
said it may have been there at least two weeks.
   Jorgensen, who was 5-foot-7, weighed about 90 pounds when he
died. The cause of death was determined after an autopsy, said James
Essling, chief investigator for the Ramsey County medical examiner's
office.
   Police were called to the home Thursday after neighbors noticed
Jorgensen's prolonged absence.
   ``We had to clear a path through the beer cans to get the body
out,'' said police Lt. Russell Bovee. ``The house was
uninhabitable.''
   Inside, officers found 5-foot piles of cans and feces, rotting
furniture, grime-covered walls and cobweb-laced ceilings.
   The fully clothed victim was found lying on the floor inside the
doorway to a bedroom, Bovee said.
   Neighbors described Jorgensen as a pipe-smoking loner with a
fondness for beer.
   William Haller, who lives on the same street, said he was aware
of the squalid conditions inside the house.
   ``He invited me over a couple of times,'' he said. ``It was a
dump. The smell just about knocked me out.''
   Jorgensen worked as a dining room assistant at the St. Paul
Athletic Club from 1973 until he was fired last spring, said Alan
Guertin, the club's director of food and beverages.
   Jorgensen began to disappear from work for days and weeks at a
time, Guertin said, and he was replaced after a three-week
disappearance last spring.

   Record cold hit central California on Friday and unseasonably
cold air headed toward the Southeast, and there was relatively
little precipitation anywhere.
   The overnight low at Bakersfield, Calif., dipped to a record 33
degrees Friday, one degree colder than the city's previous record,
set in 1957.
   Some freezing temperatures were reported near Bakersfield in
outlying sections of the southern valley citrus district.
   Unseasonably low temperatures were forecast during the night in
the Southeast. Warnings for frost and freezing temperatures were
posted over inland southern Alabama, the northern section of the
Florida Panhandle and the coast of South Carolina.
   Snow showers were scattered over northeastern New York state.
Rain along the northern Pacific Coast changed to snow over
northwestern Montana.
   There were no reports of measurable snowfall or heavy rainfall
during the 6 hours up to 1 p.m. EST, the National Weather Service
said.
   Gale warnings were posted over lakes Erie, Huron and Ontario.
Wind gusted to 55 mph at Buffalo, N.Y., during the morning.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 2
degrees above zero at Jackson, Wyo., to 80 at Palm Springs, Calif.
Friday morning's official low temperature was 9 degrees below zero
at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Saturday, rain mixed with snow was forecast over northern
Lower Michigan, with high wind over much of the upper Mississippi
Valley.
   High in the 30s and 40s were predicted from New England across
the Great Lakes, the upper Mississippi Valley, the northern Plains
and the Rockies; in the 40s and low 50s along the northern half of
the Pacific Coast; near 70 over southern Florida, central through
southern Texas, and from the desert Southwest across the southern
coast of California; and generally in the 50s and 60s over the
remainder of the nation.

   A state judge Friday recommended a new trial for a
man whose murder conviction had been questioned in the movie
documentary ``The Thin Blue Line.''
   District Judge Larry Baraka said he will tell the Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals that Randall Dale Adams deserves a new trial. The
appeals court has the power to order the retrial.
   Adams has served 12 years in prison for the shooting of officer
Robert Wood in 1976. He said he did not commit the crime.
   Much of the material being presented in the hearing this week on
the retrial request was in the documentary, which raised charges
that witnesses in the original trial had lied.
   ``I'm numb,'' Adams said after the judge issued his
recommendation. ``I don't know what to say. Right now, I'm in
shock.''
   Adams' attorney, Randy Schaffer, predicted that there would never
be a retrial if the appeals court approves it. ``They've got no
evidence. They've got no witnesses.''
   John Creuzot, an assistant prosecutor, said he had confidence in
the judge. ``If that's the way he feels, that's his call to make,''
he said. He said he had no idea if his office would indeed drop the
charges if a retrial was ordered.
   Errol Morris, who made ``The Thin Blue Line,'' said: ``I'm very
happy about the judge's decision. I deeply believe in Randall Adams'
innocence. Obviously, this man should not be in jail.''
   As reasons for a new trial, Baraka said the prosecution
suppressed some evidence that would bolster the defense, including a
written statement from a witness, Emily Miller, who gave conflicting
information about what she saw at the scene where Wood was killed.
The state also kept suppressed the fact taht Ms. Miller had picked
someone other than Adams when she viewed a police lineup.

<HEAD>Report Says Iranian Airliner Had Only 40 Seconds to React</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iranian airliner only had 40 seconds to react
to a warning before a U.S. warship shot it down on July 3, killing
all 290 people aboard, a U.N. aviation agency report was quoted as
saying on Friday.
   The report prepared by the International Civil Aviation
Organization also confirms the U.S. claim that several warnings were
given to the A-300 Airbus before it was shot down in the Persian
Gulf by the USS Vincennes, Canadian Press said.
   The report also says, however, that only a warning from another
American ship in the area, the USS Sides, was coded specifically for
Iran Air Flight 655, CP said.
   That warning came 40 seconds before the jet was destroyed by
surface-to-air missiles, CP quoted the report as saying.
   A warning coded for the civilian aircraft ``could have been
immediately recognizable to the flight crew but was given only in
the final challenge,'' the report said, according to CP. Other
warnings were sent on general military and civilian emergency radio
frequencies.
   Cmdr. Dave Thomas, a Defense Department spokesman in Washington,
said the Pentagon had not received the report and would have no
comment.
   Edmund Stohr, a U.S. representative at the aviation organization,
refused comment Friday but said in an interview Thursday the United
States considers the report fair.
   Airport officials in Iran were unaware a skirmish between the
Vincennes and Iranian gunboats in the gulf just before the airliner
left Bandar Abbas for a flight across the waterway, said the report,
which is to be presented to the agency's governing council Monday.
   ``No `red alert' status was in effect and the air traffic control
units in Tehran and Bandar Abbas were unaware of any activities at
sea,'' the report was quoted as saying.
   A Pentagon report blamed the downing of the airliner on human
error by the crew of the Vincennes, which mistook the commercial jet
for an Iranian F-14 fighter.
   According to the Pentagon report, the plane was warned 12 times
to change its course away from the battle zone.
   The International Civil Aviation Organization's report says the
sophisticated Aegis radar system on the Vincennes ``recorded a
flight profile consistent with a normal climb profile of an Airbus
A-300,'' CP said. The report says the plane was climbing normally
from Bandar Abbas airport and was well within the ``lateral''
boundaries of the flight corridor across the gulf.
   U.S. Navy investigators said September the Iranian aircraft had
been climbing until it was shot down.
   The International Civil Aviation Organization's report, prepared
at the request of a special meeting in July of the 33-nation ICAO
council, is highly technical and does not fix blame. It has been
widely circulated at the agency's Montreal headquarters.

<HEAD>Author Pleads `No Contest' in Stolen Library Book Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A novelist and Oscar nominee who
was charged with stealing thousands of books from more than 70
libraries pleaded no contest Friday to possessing stolen property.
   Gustav Jerry Hasford, who co-wrote the screenplay for the 1987
screenplay ``Full Metal Jacket,'' entered the plea in a bargain with
prosecutors, who dropped two criminal counts of grand theft.
   The plea was accepted by San Luis Obispo County Superior Court
Judge Harry Woolpert. Deputy District Attorney Terry
Estrada-Mullaney has recommended that Hasford serve six months in
jail.
   Hasford's defense attorney, Orlan Donley, did not immediately
return a telephone call to his office seeking comment.
   As part of the plea bargain, Hasford also was ordered to pay
restitution on all of the criminal counts. Sentencing was set for
Jan. 4.
   Hasford pleaded to possession of about 2,000 books, valued at
about $20,000, taken from public libraries in Los Angeles; Santa
Monica; Sacramento; St. Louis; Longview, Wash.; London and the city,
county and university libraries in the central California coastal
community of San Luis Obispo.
   The books were primarily Civil War research volumes, the
prosecutor said.
   The screenplay for the film ``Full Metal Jacket,'' which Hasford
co-wrote with director Stanley Kubrick and Michael Herr, was drawn
largely from Hasford's Vietnam War novel, ``The Short-Timers.''
   Although nominated for an Academy Award, the best screenplay
Oscar for 1987 was given to the authors of ``The Last Emperor.''
   The investigation began on March 17 when police at California
Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo served a search
warrant at a storage locker rented by Hasford. They were searching
for 87 overdue books that Hasford had checked out on his Cal Poly
library card.
   Among the estimated 10,000 books found in Hasford's possession
were at least 2,000 allegedly stolen from 77 libraries, Ms.
Estrada-Mullaney said. ``We had suspicions about some of the other
books, but we could only prove the 2,000,'' she said.
   Books found in the locker appeared to be from a city library in
Perth, Australia; Purdue University; the Foxburg Free Library in
Pennsylvania; the Coco Beach, Fla., public library and the Evanston,
Ill., Historical Society.
   Investigators also learned that a book theft warrant for Hasford
had been outstanding in Sacramento County for three years.

Agent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Friday accused FBI agents
of misusing a federal grand jury subpoena to retaliate against a
Hispanic agent who filed a successful discrimination lawsuit against
the bureau.
   In a 17-page memorandum, U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton ruled
that FBI agents requested a grand jury subpoena during an internal
investigation of agent Bernardo Perez after he and other Hispanic
agents sued the bureau. There was no legitimite purpose for the
subpoena, he said.
   The class-action lawsuit filed in January 1987 contended that the
FBI promoted Hispanic agents too slowly, assigned them
less-desirable jobs and gave them little recognition for their
successes. Bunton ruled in favor of the Hispanic agents in
September; damages have not been determined.
   In his 17-page opinion Friday, the judge said a subpoena issued
in February 1987, three weeks after the lawsuit was filed, was
requested without justification to gather telephone records on Perez.
   The allegation about the subpoena was brought up in August during
the trial on the lawsuit, but Bunton postponed consideration of the
issue because attorneys for the FBI said they were not prepared to
respond to it.
   When a hearing on the issue was held last month, the FBI denied
that the subpoena was requested in retaliation for the lawsuit.
   But in his ruling Friday, Bunton said the FBI did not state a
``legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for securing the subpoena ...
and that demonstrates that the securing of the grand jury subpoena
was not legitimate.''
   ``To deny that there was not a close causal relationship between
the grand jury subpoena and the filing of the Title VII
(discrimination) complaint is to fly in the face of reason,'' Bunton
concluded.
   Perez's attorney, Antonio Silva, said Bunton's ruling was ``a
significant finding in that it details retaliation against Mr.
Perez.''
   Tom McPoyle of the FBI's headquarters in Washington said Friday
that he couldn't comment on the judge's ruling ``because of the
ongoing litigation.''
   According to testimony at the hearing last month, FBI officials
began investigating Perez in 1986, after he filed an internal
discrimination complaint. The investigation concerned statements
Perez had made at the espionage trial of a former fellow agent,
Richard Miller.
   Perez had testified that while he was second-in-command of the
Los Angeles FBI office, he recommended that his boss, Richard
Bretzing, fire Miller for incompetence. Bretzing denied that Perez
ever made that recommendation.
   Miller was not fired at the time, and he was eventually convicted
of passing secrets to the Soviets.
   An FBI agent in Washington, Gary Hart, concluded that there was
no evidence to bring criminal perjury charges against Perez, but he
continued an administrative investigation into the agent.
   In February 1987, Hart asked a federal prosecutor in Alexandria,
Va., to secure a subpoena of telephone records related to Perez.
   Hart said he needed the subpoena to determine whether Perez was
telling the truth when he told Hart he had tried to call him from a
pay phone in Virginia while en route to Washington to meet with him
to discuss the Miller case.
   But thejudge ruled Friday that since the criminal investigation
was over at that point, the request for the subpoena was unjustified.

   The government shut down the Yugoslav
consulate in Sydney on Friday and ordered the consulate staff to
leave the country after they refused to turn over a security guard
who allegedly wounded a protester.
   The government had set a 24-hour deadline Thursday for Yugoslav
officials to turn the guard over to Australian police.
   When the consulate refused to comply, Foreign Minister Gareth
Evans said that the staff of 12 and their families must leave
Australia by Monday evening.
   ``I deeply regret Australia has been forced into this action by
the refusal of the Yugoslav government to allow the law to take its
normal course,'' he said.
   In Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Foreign Minister Budimir Loncar strongly
attacked Australia for its actions.
   In an interview with Belgrade television, he said Australia had
broken international conventions. He said his government would
demand ``satisfaction'' but gave no details and announced no
retaliatory moves.
   ``I must express my great satisfaction, even pride that our
consular staff honorably, bravely, decisively and in a dignified
manner defended the sovereignty of their country, the territory
which belongs to us and the honor of our flag,'' Loncar said.
   Evans said his government reserved the right to claim
compensation from Yugoslav authorities for the family of 16-year-old
Jospeh Tokic, who was shot in the throat during a demonstration
outside the consulate Sunday, Yugoslav National Day.
   Yugoslav authorities said the guard, identified as Matijas Zoran,
fired in self-defense when several Croatian youths began scaling the
consulate walls. Croatians are among several ethnic groups in
Yugoslavia.
   About 200,000 Yugoslavs live in Australia.
   Yugoslavia's state-run Tanjug news agency said the Yugoslav
government referred to the demonstrators as Ustashas, Croatian
fascists who allied with Nazi Germany against Yugoslav resistance
forces during World War II.

   In a harsh rebuke to its host country, the
General Assembly on Friday voted to move a meeting to Geneva so it
can hear an address by PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, who was denied a
visa to enter the United States.
   The assembly voted 154-2 to hold the session in Geneva on Dec.
13-15. The United States and Israel were the only nations voting
against the measure.
   Britain abstained. It has said the United States should allow
Arafat to speak but opposed the harsh criticism of the United States
in the U.N. resolution.
   The unprecedented shift to Geneva was ordered because the United
States rejected U.N. appeals to reconsider and admit Arafat, who it
accuses of being an accessory to terrorism.
   Arafat sought to address the 159-nation world body here this week
during its annual debate on Palestine.
   He was to have addressed the General Assembly on Thursday in New
York to discuss recent decisions of the Palestine National Council
in Algiers to declare an independent Palestinian state and accept
U.N. resolutions which implicitly recognize Israel's right to exist.
   The meeting in Geneva would be the first time the United Nations
has convened a regular session outside New York City since the
General Assembly first moved into its permanent Manhattan
headquarters, which opened in 1952.
   Between 1946 and 1952, the United Nations held sessions primarily
in New York but also met twice in Paris and once, its first meeting,
in London.
   Absent from Friday's roll call were Dominica and South Africa.
South Africa, because of its policies of racial apartheid, was
stripped of its voting rights in 1974.
   After the vote, the highest-ranking U.S. official at the United
Nations, Undersecretary-General Joseph Verner Reed, sent a personal
letter to President Reagan, appealing to him to let Arafat speak.
   The letter was widely but not officially circulated, and Reed
said he was not responsible for leaking it to the press.
   ``The bottom line, Mr. President, is that the action (to deny a
visa) to an invited guest of the United Nations has done
incalculable damage to United States credibility in the world
arena.''
   Reed said the United States is a ``proponent of free speech all
over the world, yet it will not permit Chairman Arafat to enter the
United States to speak in a public forum on international territory
...
   ``Does this spell the end of the United Nations in the United
States and the United States in the United Nations ... ''
   Israel's acting ambassador, Johanan Bein, had urged the General
Assembly to reject the measure.
   ``This assembly is asked to pack its bags and go to another
continent for the dubious pleasure of lending an ear to the person
who conceived, instigated and organized some of the world's
cruellest atrocities against the innocent citizens of many nations.''
   U.S. Ambassador Herbert S. Okun said: ``The change of venue is
unnecessary. Nevertheless we would not oppose such a move and the
United States would be represented if a meeting were held in
Geneva.''
   He said the United States was justified in denying a visa to
Arafat.
   PLO envoy Zuhdi Labib Terzi said: ``Once again, within hours, the
international body in this community has stood together for what is
right against what is wrong.''
   He said the PLO would have preferred to meet in New York. ``It is
only because of the intransigence of the host country and its lack
of respect for international law that it has to pick up the bill of
more than a million dollars.''
   He was referring to transportation costs of all delegations,
above the U.N. estimate of $645,500.
   The three-day meeting at Geneva's stately Palais de Nations, the
U.N. European Headquarters, will require an additional appropriation
of $440,700, but about $204,800 in other costs can be absorbed in
the existing budget, U.N. officials said.
   The United States probably would be expected to pay a quarter of
the additional cost, in accordance with its one-fourth share of the
regular annual budget. It has said it would participate in the
Geneva session.
   The United Nations is facing a financial crisis, caused largely
by the U.S. indebtedness of about $500 million. The United States is
the biggest U.N. contributor and its biggest debtor nation.
   On Wednesday the assembly overwhelmingly deplored the U.S. denial
of a visa to Arafat to speak in New York. It gave the United States
24 hours to reconsider and reverse its decision.
   On Thursday night, the U.S. government defied the U.N. resolution
and rejected its appeal, saying the decision to bar Arafat was final.
   Arafat, who visited the United Nations in 1974, was barred from
visiting the U.N. on international territory by Secretary of State
George P. Shultz on grounds that he is an ``accessory to terrorism.''
   The United Nations says that by denying Arafat a visa the United
States has violated the 1947 U.S.-U.N. Headquarters Agreement, under
which the United States is obligated to grant visas to U.N. guests.

   A lawyer for a couple who believe a
10-year-old Sarasota girl is their daughter said Friday that he has
medical records to support their claim, and a judge gave the couple
permission to get more records.
   Regina and Ernest Twigg maintain their daughter was switched
after birth in Hardee Memorial Hospital with a sickly child and that
records were altered to hide the swap.
   The Twiggs of Langhorne, Pa., named the baby they took home
Arlena and raised her until her death in August from heart disease.
Just before she died they learned through genetic tests that Arlena
was not their biological daughter. Her B-positive blood type didn't
match their Type O.
   Kimberly Mays was the only other white girl born at the same time
at Hardee Memorial. Her mother died soon after brith. The girl has
been raised by her father, Robert, a Sarasota roofing supply
salesman who is fighting efforts by the Twiggs to challenge
parentage.
   Attorney John Blakely made only passing reference to the medical
records at a hearing.
   But outside the courthouse, he said he had documents from Hardee
Memorial showing Barbara Mays had Type B blood and the child she
bore was B-positive. The baby also was born with fetal stress and
bluish extremities, conditions consistent with heart problems,
Blakely said.
   ``Everything in the records indicates we are correct in assuming
Mrs. Mays delivered Arlena Twigg,'' Blakely said. ``Hospital records
indicate Mrs. Twigg delivered a baby with O-positive.''
   Blakely doesn't know yet Kimberly's blood type.
   However, Circuit Judge Andy Owen granted the Twiggs' motions for
hospital medical records on Kimberly's birth and Mrs. May's
pregnancy and delivery, and the results, if any, of any genetic
testing that has been done.
   The judge also said Blakely could take sworn statements from
medical and custodial personnel at the hospital to document records.
   ``It was a very successful day in terms of proceeding in this
matter,'' Blakely said.
   The judge denied motions by Mays' attorney, Arthur Ginsburg, to
dismiss the case and force the Twiggs to state beforehand whether
they intend to seek custody.
   The Twiggs want a judicial decree that Kimberly is their
daughter. The judge said they have to ``establish their rights'' to
her before a decision can be made on parentage.
   ``I think we're doing it backwards,'' Ginsburg told the judge.
``We are saying to Kimberly, `We're going to find out who your
parents are and then who is going to have custody of you.'
   ``She does not want to meet the Twiggs. She doesn't want to have
her blood tested. She wants to stay with her father. No one has
asked her what she wants.''

   Two female hostages were released unharmed
Friday by two inmates who took them hostage and demanded to meet
with reporters over conditions at the overcrowded Wyoming State
Penitentiary
   Abdula Amin, 37, and Don Calkins, 25, ``gave up without so much
as a bad word,'' said Warden Duane Shillinger after the inmates'
5:40 p.m. surrender. ``They apologized for what they did and they
are not even certain why they did it.
   The prisoners initially sought a news conference to air their
grievances, but surrendered without incident almost 11 hours after
taking the women captive.
   ``Mr. Amin said at one point, `We don't know why we did it. It
got started and we couldn't stop it,''' Shillinger said. The two
inmates were taken to the Carbon County jail pending the filing of
charges against them.
   The two inmates were wielding knives fashioned from a scissors
blade and a razor blade when they took counselors Barbara France and
Betty Lewis hostage shortly after 7 a.m., during sick call in the
prison's maximum-security unit.
   The inmates, both serving sentences for sexual assault
convictions, bound themselves to the women with tape and held them
captive in a counseling room, Shillinger said.
   ``My mouth is very dry. We've been through a very emotional
day,'' Shillinger said after meeting with the women. ``I'm not
ashamed to say that when I saw those women walk out the door, I
broke down and cried. We're so glad this turned out in the manner it
did.''
   Prison officials, including an FBI-trained negotiator, spoke with
the inmates by telephone through the day Friday, but Shillinger said
any demands beyond those for food would not be granted unless the
women were released.
   Reporters from Wyoming and Colorado flocked to the penitentiary
in the afternoon, but prison officials kept their presence secret
from the inmates.
   Photographers and television camera operators were prevented from
taking pictures.
   Associate Warden Al Urie said Amin began serving an eight- to
20-year sentence on a conviction of first-degree sexual assault and
a life term for a habitual offender conviction in December 1983.
   Calkins began serving an eight- to 15-year sentence on two
convictions of first-degree sexual assault and aggravated burglary
in April 1985.
   Neither Amin nor Calkins had created major problems at the prison
in the past, Urie said.
   France has worked at the prison about three years, and Lewis
started there last month, said Shillinger.
   The penitentiary, built because of overcrowding in the state's
old prison, was full soon after opening in 1981. Additions and
mobile units were constructed in the yard, but the prison population
has continued to fill the available space.
   A report issued last fall said the current penitentiary capacity
of 710 inmates was exceeded in August 1987 and January 1988. Prison
officials projected the population would reach 800 prisoners by this
fall and 900 by May 1990. Officials were not able to immediately
provide the current head-count at the prison.

<HEAD>Wilderness Scouts Decline To End Flap By Joining Boy Or Girl Scouts</HEAD>

   Despite the threat of a lawsuit,
Georgia's Wilderness Scouts have decided to remain autonomous rather
than affiliate with the national Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.
   The directors of the Wilderness Scouts of America Inc. voted
unanimously Thursday to keep both their name and mission, said
Harold Cornwell, founder of the organization for underprivileged
youngsters.
   The Boy Scouts of America had threatened to sue the Wilderness
Scouts over their use of the word ``scout,'' which the Boy Scouts
claim the rights to.
   But on Monday, Boy Scout officials offered to charter the
Wilderness Scouts as an affiliate of the national organization.
Under the plan, female Wilderness Scouts would have become Girl
Scouts and male Wilderness Scouts would become Boy Scouts.
   Cornwell said his 45-member group decided to remain separate, in
part because of a child molestation case involving one of his
scouts. The stepfather of the scout was sentenced Thursday to 20
years plus fines for aggravated sodomy.
   ``We were instrumental in bringing this case forward,'' Cornwell
said. ``We noticed he was distraught and crying in the meetings.
   ``That little boy would never have been able to join the Boy
Scouts,'' Cornwell said. ``He didn't even have a bed; he slept on
the floor. Who would have paid his dues? Some of our kids don't even
have a toothbrush. That's Third World poverty as far as I'm
concerned.''
   Cornwell said his group's volunteer attorney, who specializes in
patent and copyright law, ``says keep on with our mission.''
   Wayne Brock, executive director of the Boy Scouts' Northeast
Georgia Council, said Boy Scout officials had hoped the dispute
would be settled by chartering Cornwell's scouts. He said further
action will have to be determined by national Boy Scout officials.
   ``We're not opposed to their activities,'' Brock said. ``The only
issue is the use of the word `scout.'''
   Cornwell, a disabled Vietnam veteran, founded the group five
years ago to help children with backgrounds similar to his own. He
was raised in a one-parent home after his father was murdered, and
he could not afford a Boy Scout uniform or badges as a youth.
   Wilderness Scouts have no dues, uniforms or badges, but are
active in conservation and service in the community.

   Yugoslavia's consul general in Chicago was ordered
to appear in a Philadelphia court Saturday for a hearing on charges
he took part in a money laundering scheme.
   A 17-month sting operation culminated Thursday with the
announcement of a 21-count indictment naming Bahrudin Bijedic, 52,
and four other men, along with LBS Bank of New York Inc., the U.S.
branch of a Yugoslavian bank.
   At a hearing in Chicago Friday, Bijedic was released from custody
but ordered to remain in the company of U.S. Customs officials until
Saturday's appearance in Philadelphia.
   ``I want you to be able to travel not in the context of a
prisoner, but you will have to follow the directions of the agents
who accompany you,'' said U.S. Magistrate Bernard Weisberg.
   Saturday's hearing will be to consider bond and issues of
diplomatic immunity, Weisberg said.
   The Yugoslavian embassy in Washington issued a statement saying
it was ``distressed that something like that could happen to a
diplomatic officer and that any diplomat might provide grounds for
such allegations.''
   The embassy emphasized its desire for good relations with the
United States and said: ``The Department of State made clear that
the action was directed solely at the individuals named in the
indictment and not against the Yugoslav diplomatic and consular
missions in the United States and the Yugoslav government.
   In Belgrade, Yugoslavia, the Foreign Ministry ``presented a
demarche to the (U.S.) State Department expecting explanation and
additional information'' on the incident, according to a statement
carried by the state news agency Tanjug.
   Bijedic, who became consul general in Chicago in 1985, is not
protected by diplomatic immunity because the charges are that his
actions were not official functions of the consulate, said Ana
Marija Besker, a spokeswoman for the embassy.
   U.S. Customs Commissioner William von Raab said Bijedic may have
been acting under the instructions of superiors, but said
authorities had no evidence to that effect.
   ``I hope that this investigation will serve as a notice to other
government agencies that the East Bloc is still desperate to get its
hands not only on our high technology, but our hard currency,'' von
Raab said.
   The 21-count indictment said U.S. undercover agents gave nearly
$1.5 million in cash to the five men to be laundered. The men, who
believed the money came from organized crime and was to be used to
pay for exporting restricted high technology and military equipment,
helped conceal its origin by depositing the cash abroad, then wiring
it back to U.S. bank accounts, officials said.
   The charges detailed eight transactions totaling $1.47 million.
In all the cases, money was carried to foreign countries,
particularly Yugoslavia, and transferred back to the United States
electronically under the names of phony corporations, officials said.
   In at least one transaction, Bijedic provided the men with
diplomatic stickers that forbade U.S. officials from opening
suitcases containing $500,000 in small bills, according to the
Customs Service.
   ``The use of diplomatic or consular pouches is a serious problem
with respect to high-tech diversions and obviously, here now, it's
been seen to be a possible money-laundering device,'' von Raab said.
   All five men were charged with violating currency reporting laws,
the arms export and control act and conspiracy, customs officials
said.
   Indicted were Bijedic, 52; Vjekoslov Spanjol, 31, a naturalized
U.S. citizen from Texas; Vinko Mir, 54, chairman of LBS Bank; Hubert
Francis Cole, 44, of Carrollton, Texas; and Larry Card, 50, of
Chattanooga, Tenn.
   If convicted, Cole faces up to 230 years in jail and a $10.6
million fine, officials said. Spanjol faces up to 100 years in jail
and a $5.1 million fine if convicted, and Bijedic, Card and Mir face
up to five years in jail and a $250,000 fine, officials said.
   Cole and Spanjol were being held in federal custoday in
Philadelphia pending a bail hearing on Monday.
   Card, arrested Thursday night in Chattanooga, will be taken to
Philadelphia for a bail hearing after appearing before a federal
magistrate, officials said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Sarmousakis, the case prosecutor,
said Friday he expected that Mir and Card will all appear in
Philadelphia federal court early next week.

   Five armed Soviet hijackers surrendered
and freed a hostage flight crew Friday, ending a two-day drama that
began when they seized a busload of children in southern Russia and
demanded a plane out of the country.
   The four men and a woman, who said they wanted to flee the Soviet
Union, stepped onto the tarmac at Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion Airport
carrying bags filled with rubles worth $3.3 million. The Soviet
government paid the money as ransom for releasing the youngsters and
a teacher.
   Once off the plane, the hijackers dumped the cash on the ground
after being asked to show they were not carrying explosives.
Soldiers then helped the hijackers scoop up the cash, and the five
held tightly to the bags as they were led off to the Abu Kabir jail
near Tel Aviv.
   ``They were five simple criminals with a lot of money who wanted
to flee the Soviet Union,'' said Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, army chief of
staff.
   ``They were people who wanted to fly out of the Soviet Union.
That's why they kidnapped the bus with the children,'' said Yuri
Nikolaevitch Yermilov, the flight engineer.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the plane and the crew would
be returned to the Soviet Union. ``The hijackers will be
interrogated and Israel will act according to international law,''
Rabin said.
   He was quoted as saying later on NBC News that ``...those who
violated the Russian law'' will be returned to Soviet authorities.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Allon Liel said he was not aware of
any written Soviet request for extradition of the hijackers, but he
added, ``I don't see any reason why we would want to hold them.''
   He said the Soviet Union and Israel did not have an extradition
treaty. But he said both nations have signed international treaties
on punishing and extraditing airplane hijackers.
   The hijacking came at a sensitive time in Soviet-Israeli
relations, which gradually have been improving since Moscow severed
them during the 1967 Middle East war.
   The hijackers surrendered at 6:15 p.m. (11:15 a.m. EST), about 35
minutes after the Aeroflot Ilyushin-76 touched down, guided by
Israeli air force jets. U.S. officials were on the runway, as was
the head of a Soviet delegation temporarily based in Israel,
officials said.
   The surrender and release of the eight-member hostage crew ended
a day of frantic diplomatic contacts involving Israel, the Soviet
Union and the United States.
   The dramatic bid to flee the Soviet Union began Thursday in the
Soviet city of Ordzhonikidze in the southern part of the Russian
republic.
   ``A group of armed bandits hijacked a bus with 30 schoolchildren
and a teacher and demanded a plane to deliver them abroad,'' Albert
Vlasov, head of the Soviet news agency Novosti, told a news
conference in Moscow.
   The official news agency Tass said the hijackers, armed with
three pistols and an automatic rifle, ``demanded a huge sum of money
and an airliner for a flight out of the country'' in exchange for
the hostages. The bus was taken to the local airport, but there was
not a big enough plane there so the hijackers took off from
neighboring Mineralniye Vodi, Tass said.
   Israel radio said the hijackers included two Russians, two
Armenians and a resident of the Ossetian Soviet republic near
Turkey. Army officials said they knew while the plane was still in
the air that there were no Soviet Jews aboard.
   Vlasov said the hijackers said they wanted to go either to
Israel, South Africa or Pakistan. Israeli officials said Iraq and
Egypt was also on the list.
   Flight engineer Yermilov said that during the flight the
hijackers played cards and kept an eye on the crew, but did not
threaten them.
   Shortl after the plane landed, army officials said, one hijacker
came out and was met by two negotiators.
   Three crew members then emerged and joined the discussions, which
ended with the hijacker giving up a handgun, the officials said. The
rest of the eight-member crew then came out and the drama ended.
   An unidentified crew member told Israel army radio that seconds
before the surrender, ``one of the hijackers asked, `Is this Israel
or Syria?' When they heard Israel, they said they would stay.''
   Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, a senior army commander, said the
hijackers demanded proof that they were in Israel. ``They said,
`Wait a minute, we want to see something in Yiddish, or at least a
Star of David,''' he said.
   Rabin told reporters that the hijackers had a sawed-off shotgun
and four pistols, but did not use force once they landed.
   The last reported hijacking in the Soviet Union was in March,
when members of a family musical group from Sibera tried to seize an
Aeroflot plane en route to Leningrad. When the plane neared
Leningrad, a Soviet army assault team stormed the craft, reports
said. Five of the hijackers, three other passengers and a stewardess
were killed.

   President Reagan's national security adviser
said Friday that U.S. officials will advance no new proposals and
don't expect any surprises from Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
at the superpower meeting next week on Governors Island, N.Y.
   Briefing reporters on the visit that Reagan, Gorbachev and
President-elect George Bush will have on Wednesday, Lt. Gen. Colin
D. Powell said Reagan looks forward to ``one final session with the
general secretary to note the stable relationship that exists now,
the improving relationship, and allow the vice president to continue
to build on that relationship.''
   He said the U.S. contingent is ready for, but he doesn't expect,
any repetition of Gorbachev's pattern of surprise at the hurried
summit in Reykjavik, Iceland, two years ago. It was there that the
Soviet leader caught the Americans off guard with sweeping proposals
that included the virtual elimination of strategic nuclear arsenals.
   Powell applauded the recent Soviet decision to stop jamming
broadcasts of the Voice of America and other Western programs, and
he said that U.S. officials were heartened by the Kremlin's decision
to release scores of refuseniks. But he said the United States still
wants to see the Soviet ``institutionalize'' human rights reforms.
   The three-star Army officer, who soon will be promoted to the
rank of general and will return to active duty with command
responsibility for all troops stationed in this country, was asked
what U.S. officials would do if Gorbachev sprang a surprise
reminiscent of Reykjavik.
   ``I don't know that we have to ensure against a surprise,'' he
replied. But Powell also said that ``We have seen them try to turn a
flank from time to time.''
   `` ... And I think we would be prepared to deal with any surprise
that they might come up with, take it under advisement, without
feeling that we're under any pressure during a ... two-and-a-half
lunch period, to necessarily respond in a substantive way to
something that had not been anticipated,'' he said.
   Deputy Soviet Foreign Minister Vladimir Petrovsky told a press
briefing in Moscow on Friday that Afghanistan, Central America and
the Middle East are among the items Gorbachev will discuss with
Reagan and Bush.
   Petrovsky said Gorbachev's speech next week at the United Nations
will detail ``the Soviet leadership's views on major issues of world
development.''
   U.S. officials were widely criticized in the wake of the summit
in Iceland, which collapsed when Reagan and Gorbachev disagreed over
the Soviet leader's demand that the U.S. president substantially
downgrade Reagan's Star Wars missile-defense program.
   Powell said that U.S. officials do not know why Gorbachev is
traveling on to Cuba after leaving this country.
   ``I really would hope that he would recognize that until
something is done with respect to the problem presented to us by
Cuba and Nicaragua, we will always have an irritant in our
relationship,'' the national security adviser said. `` ... We cannot
go as far as we would like to go with respect to the solution of
regional problems.''
   Petrovsky said all the meetings on Gorbachev's trip _ which
includes visits with Fidel Castro in Cuba and with Prime Minister
Minister Margaret Thatcher in London _ were related.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A powerful army officer who had been
indicted in the United States on drug-smuggling charges was killed
earlier this month by poison, police said Friday.
   The ex-wife of Col. Jean-Claude Paul earlier said he suffered a
heart attack at his home on Nov. 6.
   Paul was indicted by a federal court in Miami earlier this year
on charges of drug smuggling. Haitian ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril
forced him to give up his command of the powerful Dessalines
Barracks in October and to retire.
   He died moments after eating pumpkin soup, launching a wave of
speculation he had been murdered.
   Port-au-Prince Police Chief Col. Georges Valcin said Friday night
that Paul died after ``absorbing a toxic substance'' which he did
not identify.
   ``There was nothing in the leftover soup,'' he told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview. ``But be careful: it
could have been in the plate, which was washed immediately
afterwards.''
   Valcin said a sample of Paul's intestinal tract was analyzed at
Vidal Hospital in Paris. He said the chemical substance that was
found is under study.
   Police said nothing about who might have killed Paul or why.
   Paul's family and a medical source insisted immediately after his
death that he had been poisoned.
   However, his ex-wife, Mireille Delinois, said he died of a heart
attack.
   She was arrested the day after Paul's death, but authorities
released her Nov. 26 after a judge ruled her detention was illegal
because no charge was filed.
   Meanwhile, a Haitian official said Friday that he hopes the
United States will not ``make a political affair'' of last month's
arrest of a former-high ranking Haitian officer on drug charges.
   Retired Col. Gary Leon, former general secretary of the Haitian
Army High Command, was arrested on Nov. 18 in New York in possession
of about $200,000 worth of pure cocaine, the Drug Enforcement
Administration said.
   ``The Haitian government expects that justice will be done
according to the American laws in force with a sense of equity and
without any attempt to make a political affair of the case,''
Bernard Degraff, the government information director, said Friday.
   Leon was forced into retirement after rank-and-file soldiers
ousted former ruler Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy in a coup Sept. 17 and
installed Avril.

   At least one of the five women whose
skeletons have been found along highways in southeastern
Massachusetts since July may have been involved with drugs or
prostitution in this port city, authorities said Friday.
   ``They're all murder victims. No doubt about it,'' said Bristol
County District Attorney Ronald A. Pina.
   Authorities suspect a serial killer may be responsible because
the skeletal remains were found in a six- to eight-mile radius, in
dense woods within 25 feet of Interstate 195 and Route 140, and all
are believed to be women.
   A Seattle detective spoke with New Bedford authorities by
telephone on Friday to determine if there are any links between the
Massachusetts slayings and the so-called ``Green River killer''
blamed for 48 deaths in Washington prior to 1984.
   The Green River killer, so called because many of the victims'
bodies were found near the Seattle-area river, preyed mostly on
prostitutes or transients.
   Bob Evans, commander of the Green River Task Force in Seattle,
said there was no evidence to link the cases, and that it was
routine for the task force to exchange information with other
jurisdictions investigating serial killings.
   Another body was discovered Friday in Dennis, about 50 miles east
of New Bedford on Cape Cod, but Bristol County officials said they
had no idea if it could be connected to the five bodies found in the
New Bedford area.
   The body, that of a 37-year-old man, was found next to a syringe
and needle.
   Investigators had to suspend a search of the highway area because
the trained dogs they were using were distracted by television
camera crews, Pina said.
   A woman whose skeleton was found Tuesday had been reported
missing in the summer and had been dead at least three months, Pina
said. He said her name was being withheld until relatives could be
notified.
   Three of the missing women were reported last seen in the Weld
Square area, known by police as a center for local drug trading and
prostitution in this fishing port of about 98,000 people about 50
miles south of Boston.
   ``Some of the missing people that possibly are going to be
identified were in the community at some point, in the drug
community or prostitution community,'' Pina said at a news
conference.
   ``I don't have a doubt that they are all related in one way or
another, as to the commonality of how they died, where they died,
the condition in which we found them and the locations in which we
found them,'' Pina said.
   Investigators have ``loose suspects in the case, including men
who had used prostitutes in New Bedford.
   ``We have some people we are looking at very seriously ... the
question is, who knew all these people,'' he said.
   Pina said one victim was strangled. The cause of death in some of
the others had been determined but he would not disclose those
results.
   The remains of all five women are be sent to the FBI for further
examination to more accurately determine the cause of death and
learn other details.
   Pina spokesman Thomas Gibney said police used searchlights
Thursday night but found no evidence to help the investigation. They
resumed searching Friday morning.
   ``We're hoping we found the last of them and we just have to put
some of the pieces together,'' Gibney said.
   He said investigators believe the fifth victim was a woman
because of the style of the clothing found, dungarees and a light
shirt. He said the body was severely decomposed and may have been
there a year.
   All of the bodies were so badly decomposed that none could be
identified as female on sight, Gibney said.
   The first three were spotted by motorists who pulled over on the
shoulders of the highways, authorities said.
   State police and the district attorney's office intensified their
investigation after the third body was discovered Nov. 8 off a ramp
from Interstate 195 in Dartmouth, not far from where the second body
was found July 30.
   A German shepherd owned by Connecticut State Police joined
Massachusetts State Police dogs in the search Tuesday and found the
fourth body near the same ramp. The ramp is about two miles west of
the Route 140 exit on the interstate.
   The dog turned up the fifth body less than three miles south of
where the first body was discovered July 3.
   Pina has said the five bodies might be linked to the deaths of
two suspected prostitutes from Providence, R.I., whose bodies were
found last spring near two interstate highways.

   Five men who fled Cuba in the 1980
``Freedom Flotilla,'' only to be imprisoned for crimes, were
returned to their homeland Friday in the first deportations under a
pact that set off fiery prison riots last year.
   The five handcuffed Cubans, watched by two guards each, took off
from Birmingham Municipal Airport in a U.S. Marshal's Service Boeing
727 that held about 50 people for the 90-minute flight to an airport
near Havana.
   The plane landed without incident, turned over the detainees to
Cuban authorities and returned to the United States, said Joe
Krovisky, a Justice Department spokesman in Washington. ``Everything
went smoothly,'' he said.
   The Cubans, the first of 2,500 the government wants to deport,
had been kept at the federal prison at Talladega, 60 miles east of
Birmingham, pending a final ruling on deportation.
   The flight had been scheduled for Thursday, but was delayed when
Cuba asked for more time to prepare for the five, all of whom had
committed crimes in the United States. Three of the five lost a
series of court fights in their effort to avoid going home.
   Deborah Vurstion-Wade, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said a
number of officials were on the flight, including John A. Simon of
the Immigration and Naturalization Service and Talladega Warden Don
Southerland, because ``we consider this a training exercise for the
department. We hope to have many of these flights.''
   When the Cubans got off the plane, Ms. Vurstion-Wade said, three
of them ``knelt down and kissed the ground.''
   The U.S. officials got off the airplane, Ms. Vurstion-Wade said,
and exchanged documents and a manifest with the Cubans.
   ``All went as well as planned,'' she said. ``It was very
organized, deliberate and very professional. There were absolutely
no problems.''
   She said about 20 Cuban officials met the five returnees and put
them on a bus, but that she did not know where they were taken.
   During the flight, she said, the Cubans ``were described as very
quiet. They remained handcuffed and shackled but not to their
seats.''
   The Cuban news agency Prensa Latina quoted an Interior Ministry
official as saying Cuban authorities ``immediately began procedures
to study (the detainees') judicial situation.''
   The dispatch, monitored in Mexico City, did not say where the
Cubans were taken. ``One of them shouted, `Viva Cuba!'' after
getting off the plane, Prensa Latina said.
   ``The repatriation of the five prisoners is included in the
migration accords signed by Havana and Washington in 1984 (but)
interrupted by legal problems in the United States,'' the report
said.
   It said the five had been declared ``undesireables'' by the
United States.
   The U.S. Supreme Court voted 8-1 Friday to reject an emergency
request by three of the Cubans to remain in the United States.
Justice Thurgood Marshall cast the dissenting vote, with none of the
justices commenting.
   Attorneys for the three claimed they would be persecuted if sent
home. The other two did not fight deportation.
   The deportations were the first since a 1987 agreement was
reached between the United States and Cuban President Fidel Castro
to resume the repatriations.
   That pact set off 11 days of rioting in November 1987 at federal
prisons in Atlanta and Oakdale, La., with 125 people held hostage,
one inmate slain, and heavy property damages to both institutions.
As the riots ended, the Cuban inmates were dispersed to other
prisons, including 114 to Talladega.
   There have been no reports of any inmate resistance to the latest
deportation proceedings.
   A federal judge at Birmingham is to rule by Monday whether 10
other Cubans at Talladega will be deported.
   The repatriation program for 2,746 Cubans was suspended at
Castro's insistence in 1985 after 201 were returned.
   In the 1980 boatlift, about 125,000 people, some of them convicts
or mentally ill, sailed illegally from Mariel, Cuba, to the United
States.
   The United States wants to return as many as 2,500 of the
remaining Marielitos either as ``excludable aliens'' or those
convicted of serious crimes in this country.
   The five Cubans were Miguel Beitia-Socarraz, 28, who pleaded
guilty to second-degree burglary; Onel Calzado-Garlobo, 43,
convicted in 1982 of attempted sexual assault involving a
13-year-old girl; Rene Maurin-Oliva, 25, who pleaded guilty to theft
and battery; and Hector Hernandez-Quesada and Angel
Meneses-Hernandez, who did not fight the deportation and about whom
little was known.
   In Atlanta, Carla Dudeck, coordinator for the Coalition to
Support Cuban Detainees, said Friday's deportations likely will open
the gates for more.
   ``The legal suits we filed didn't work,'' she said.
   On what treatment the deportees might face in Cuba, she said,
``All we have to base it on is those who went back in 1985. About a
third are still in jail and we don't know why or what they are doing
there.
   ``Castro called them traitors to the revolution when they left
the country, then in 1984 he said those who came back would be
treated humanitarily. It's hard to take all he says literally and
it's hard to get information (from Cuba).''
   The deportation agreement calls for up to 100 Cubans a month to
be returned. About 500 detainees remain in custody among the 2,746
that Cuba agreed to take back in 1984, Ms. Dudeck said. The others
have been paroled. Some of the 500 still have appeals left open to
them.

   Share prices soared to a record close on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange Saturday as the market expressed relief from the
threat of a interest rate hike, dealers said.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 133.25
points, or 0.45 percent, to close Saturday's half-day session at
29,665.50, its highest closing ever.
   The main economic barometer opened the week's trading with a
major setback of 380.27 points Monday, but soared in later trading
days to close 301.91 points, or 1.02 percent, above last week's
finish.
   ``Players were somewhat cautious until the release of U.S.
unemployment rate yesterday (Friday), and that seemed to have
prevented the upsurge of share prices even though the market
sentiment is still quite bullish,'' said a dealer at Nikko
Securities Co.
   He said Saturday's gain reflects the relief the market felt from
worry that the U.S. Federal Reserve Board may raise interest rates
to calm the heated economy and fear of inflation.
   ``But with the slight increase in the jobless rate, the anxiety
appeared to have been eased for the time being,'' he said.
   The U.S. Labor Department released a report Friday showing the
American jobless rate for November increased to 5.4 percent from
October's 5.3 percent.
   Volume on the first section of the exchange, where most major
shares are listed, was estimated at 600 million shares. The previous
Nikkei high was reached Wednesday when the index closed at 29,578.90
points.
   The foreign exchange market is closed on Saturdays.

   Long Island Lighting Co.'s board of
directors said Friday it would consider a proposed agreement to sell
and close the Shoreham nuclear plant despite the Legislature's
failure to approve the deal.
   But the board reaffirmed that it would not renegotiate the
agreement and would ``vigorously'' continue to pursue a full-power
license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   The Legislature failed to meet a Thursday deadline on the
agreement, which calls for the state to buy the $5.3 billion plant
from LILCO for $1, then close it.
   In return, the utility would be granted yearly rate increases of
roughly 5 percent for the next 10 years. Legislators opposing the
settlement said it placed an unfair burden on ratepayers.
   The LILCO board said Friday that if the settlement is approved
before the NRC grants a 25 percent or full-power operating license,
the utility would stick to the agreement unless ``the passage of
time has materially disadvantaged LILCO's shareholders or
customers.''
   The utility said that because the Legislature missed the
deadline, it would ignore the part of the agreement restricting it
from operating the Shoreham plant above 5 percent power, if the NRC
authorizes higher operation.
   In Albany, Gov. Mario Cuomo said LILCO officials had exercised
every option open to them.
   ``What did they give the state and the Legislature? Nothing,''
Cuomo said. ``If I were their attorney, I would be very proud of
what I've done here today and I'd be saying to them, `Look, I got
you everything.' ''
   William J. Catacosinos, LILCO chairman and chief executive
officer, said the board was disappointed by the Legislature's
inaction.
   ``We believe it is important to end the controversy surrounding
Shoreham so that LILCO and state and local officials can work
together to resolve the energy shortages on Long Island,''
Catacosinos said.
   Legislators maintain that a settlement could still be approved
within the next few weeks.
   Cuomo said his administration would continue to oppose the NRC
licensing.
   The Shoreham plant was completed in 1985, a decade late and at
seven times the original estimated cost. It has been prevented from
operating at full power because the state and Suffolk county refuse
to join in emergency evacuation planning.
   The plant, located on the northshore of Long Island about 90
miles from New York City, is now licensed to run at up to 5 percent
of full power.

   Loyalist soldiers battled mutinous
troops with mortar rounds and rifle fire Friday at an army base
outside the capital, and the government later said the two-day
rebellion appeared at an end.
   The Defense Ministry said the soldiers staged their rebellion
because they were angered by the resumption of trials on human
rights violations of fellow officers.
   The government reported one rebel killed. DyN, an independent
news agency, said several rebels also were wounded. No government
casualties were reported.
   Vice President Victor Martinez said rebel leader Col. Mohamed Ali
Seineldin gave up Friday night.
   ``Col. Seineldin has made himself absolutely responsible for the
episodes, and has subordinated himself'' to the army command,
Martinez told reporters as he walked out of Government House
following a meeting with the defense minister and army chief.
   ``There was no type of negotiation,'' he said.
   Martinez said rebels remained holed up at an infantry school on
the sprawling Campo de Mayo base outside the capital. He said that
Seineldin agreed to try to convince them to accept defeat after
loyalists fired a few mortar rounds near the school, fatally
wounding one rebel. The mutineers fired automatic rifles at the
loyalists.
   At least four army tanks entered the base, according to the
reports. Rebels who planted mines at the infantry school entrances
began removing them after Seineldin asked for a truce.
   ``The insubordinate soldiers at the infantry school at the Campo
de Mayo now accept the orders of the army chief,'' Lt. Gen. Jose
Dante Caridi said in a ministry communique.
   A spokesman for the rebels said Caridi and Seineldin ``agreed to
a truce of two weeks'' during which ``no sanctions will be taken
against anyone.'' The rebel did not give his name nor explain what
he meant by a truce.
   One officer died during the exchange of gun and mortar fire
between the two sides, the official news agency Telam reported, and
five people were injured, including a 19-year-old woman who was shot
in the neck and stomach as she walked near the base.
   The soldiers seized the infantry school on Thursday.
   
   ``This is not a coup against the government, but a fight to
restore military honor to the army and review the trials that punish
the just and promote the guilty,'' Seineldin had told reporters
inside the base.
   Civilian trials of officers accused of human rights abuses during
the 1976-83 junta-ruled military dictatorships are resuming.
   Seineldin said he commanded 400 soldiers, and he apparently also
commanded 53 coast guard men who deserted their base Thursday. The
coast guard men drove onto the infantry school grounds Friday.
   Loyal troops had surrounded the school but held up attacking in
the apparent hope of avoiding bloodshed.
   It was the third such rebellion in less than two years and army
commanders nationwide affirmed their loyalty to the civilian
government.
   President Raul Alfonsin had made no reference to the military
rebellion in his address to the U.N. General Assembly in New York on
Friday. On his way into U.N. headquarters, the president appeared
unconcerned about the mutiny and commented in Spanish that his
troops would ``suffocate'' the uprising.
   He told the assembly that if developed nations want to encourage
democracy in Latin America, they ought to provide debt relief so new
democracies are not overthrown by tyrants.
   ``Unsatisfied expectations generate desperation, which always
favors the adventures of the authoritarians,'' Alfonsin said.
   Alfonsin, whose election in 1983 ended military rule that began
with a coup in 1976, flew to Washington on Thursday evening and
conferred with President-elect George Bush at Bush's home. Alfonsin
will return home Saturday.
   Army insurrections in Argentina had occurred in April 1987 and
January 1988.
   Officers have grumbled for months at selections for promotions
and retirements, a military budget that has shrunk by half in recent
years, and pay that has not kept pace with 332 percent inflation
since Jan. 1.

   A fugitive mental patient sought in three New
Mexico killings demanded to see actor Michael Landon before fatally
shooting two Universal City movie studio guards, authorities said
Friday.
   Nathan Nick Trupp, 42, wounded in a shootout with deputies
Thursday near Universal City studios, told paramedics that God had
ordered him to kill someone.
   He had been freed from a psychiatric hospital by a court ruling
11 months ago, officials said Friday.
   ``Prior to the shooting, the suspect went on the Universal
Studios tour,'' said Sgt. Ernie Roop, a Los Angeles County sheriff's
spokesman. ``He asked several studio employees if he could talk to
Michael Landon, but was denied access.''
   Trupp asked the guards if he could use the telephone in their
guard shack to contact Landon, star of ``Highway to Heaven.'' Roop
said Trupp left when a guard told him to use a pay phone, then
returned and began shooting.
   One guard died instantly, and the other died Friday. Trupp was
wounded minutes later in a shootout with deputies near the 420-acre
Universal Studios production and entertainment complex near downtown.
   ``A paramedic said the suspect said he was told by God to shoot
somebody,'' said county fire Capt. Glenn Mutch. Trupp also was heard
to scream ``Help me! Kill me!'' as he was strapped onto a gurney.
   Landon could not immediately be reached for comment. A message
was left on an answering machine for the actor-producer's publicist.
   Trupp, who also is accused of killing three people in an
Albuquerque, N.M., bagel shop Tuesday, was involuntarily committed
to Trenton Psychiatric Hospital in New Jersey on Nov. 25, 1987.
   A court later ruled he posed no threat and ordered him released
to a supervised boarding house in February 1988, said Mary Kay Risi,
a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of Human Services.
   However, Trupp fled a Trenton-area boarding house on April 5, one
day after arriving, she said.
   He was listed in serious but stable condition Friday at Saint
Joseph Medical Center in Burbank with wounds to his chest and
abdomen, said spokeswoman Linda Roberts.
   ``One of the charges he will face will probably be murder,'' said
Deputy Roger Hom. ``As soon as he is able, he will probably be moved
to the jail ward at County-USC Medical Center.''
   Security guard Jeren Beeks, 27, of La Crescenta, Calif., died at
the scene. Officers said he was shot three times in the head. The
second guard, Armando Torres, 18, died Friday at St. Joseph Hospital
in nearby Burbank. Officers said he was shot once in the head and
twice in the body.
   Tom Lopez, an engineer at the entertainment complex, said he
heard the shots but assumed they were from the ``Miami Vice'' live
entertainment show for tourists. ``When you hear gunshots in a
studio, you don't associate them with murder,'' he said.
   Trupp was unemployed and lived off a $100,000 inheritance, said
Albuquerque police, who were looking for him in connection with
Tuesday's bagel shop slayings.
   Richard Wilt, 39, his wife, Jeanne Wilt, 37, both of Albuquerque,
and the woman's father, Joseph Famiglietta Sr., 63, of nearby Rio
Rancho, were killed when a man opened fire in the store.
   According to published reports, a cab driver told authorities
that Trupp had complained of the shop's ``lousy food,'' and
Famiglietta's wife, Joan, said her husband had received a
threatening call the Sunday before the slayings.
   The caller said he was ``short a bagel,'' and added, ``I'm going
to get you for this,'' the reports said.
   The cab driver who drove Trupp to the gunshop where he purchased
a .38-caliber handgun said Trupp had told him he had been instructed
by God to kill a Nazi SS officer.

   The Reagan administration's refusal to turn
over classified documents for the Iran-Contra trial of Oliver North
jeopardizes the prosecution's central charges against the former
national security aide.
   President Reagan insists that the documents are being withheld
for national security reasons, and says the decision is not a ploy
to prevent North from going to trial.
   ``The things we're blocking are the things that duty requires we
block,'' Reagan said Thursday. ``These are things that are national
security secrets.''
   Asked if the move were a backdoor maneuver to keep the case
against North from going to trial, he replied: ``No, this is
something that from the very beginning we knew we would have to do.''

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ The record buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc.
has stirred dreams of big stock profits and hopes that the company's
corporate headquarters would return to this tobacco city, but it
also brought fears of layoffs.
   ``I think the general feeling is one of uncertainty,'' Fred
Nordenholz, president of the Winston-Salem Chamber of Commerce, said
Thursday. ``There are lots of mixed feelings about what's
happening.''
   The food and tobacco giant was auctioned off to buyout firm
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. late Wednesday in a $24.53 billion
deal valued at about $109 a share in cash and securities.
   That is virtually double the stock's price before management
started a bidding war six weeks ago and represents a big windfall
for this city. Analysts estimate that about 9,000 people in the area
plus local trusts, foundations and retirement plans own stock now
worth a little more than $2 billion.

   The FBI says a sting operation that began in
a small suburban Buffalo storefront knocked out a massive American
and Sicilian Mafia drug operation that was selling millions of
dollars worth of heroin in the United States and cocaine in Italy.
   Some of the heroin was shipped as liquefied heroin in wine
bottles from Italy, officials said.
   Although the international food trading company set up by agents
three years ago never handled any drug shipments, it allowed the FBI
to establish contacts with organized crime operations in the United
States and Italy, G. Robert Langford, special agent in charge of the
FBI's Buffalo office, said Thursday.
   As a result of the investigation, which broadened to include FBI
offices nationwide, the FBI and Italian authorities have charged
more than 200 people in a multimillion-dollar heroin importation and
cocaine distribution operation involving Sicilian Mafia figures and
the Gambino crime family in New York.

   Shows honoring the ``Dust Bowl Balladeer,'' who died in 1967,
have been held in such grand auditoriums as Carnegie Hall. But
Thursday's was the first in Okemah because people like city

<HEAD>British Endorse Mixed Catholic-Protestant Schools in Northern
Ireland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British government has
officially endorsed the idea of bringing Roman Catholic and
Protestant children together in the classroom as a way of bridging
the sectarianism that bloodies Northern Ireland.
   The headmaster of one such integrated school told recently of one
classroom incident that led him to believe the initiative might at
least bring better understanding between the feuding Catholic and
Protestant communities in the British province.
   The incident involved an Irish Republican Army funeral in March,
when two British soldiers were dragged from a car and killed at the
cemetery. Catholic and Protestant students came to class in anger
afterward.
   ``Here was your acid test for integrated education,'' said the
headmaster, Terence Flanagan of Lagan College, where Catholic and
Protestant children 11 to 17 years old learn together.
   ``The students talked about it and while they didn't agree ...
they realized there was a difference of opinion and they didn't feel
they had to go for one another.''
   Historically, education in Northern Ireland has reflected the
province's divisions: more than 99 percent of youngsters attend
either state schools, which are almost entirely Protestant, or
church-run Catholic schools.
   But after decades on the sidelines, the government took a
landmark decision Oct. 5 to endorse integrated education like that
at Lagan. The reason, says the province's education minister, Dr.
Brian Mawhinney, was that a growing number of parents _ one-third,
according to a recent poll _ wanted it.
   Integrated schools, part of a wider program by Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's government to encourage cross-community contact,
is the key element of the biggest shakeup of Northern Irish
education for 40 years.
   As a sign of London's official backing for the reforms, Princess
Anne visited Lagan College in late November and talked with the
students.
   The reforms, expected to become law by 1990, will for the first
time also require all children to study the same course material in
all subjects.
   Schools now can develop their own courses. While they are similar
because students take the same national exams, Catholic schools tend
to focus more on Irish history and writers while Protestant schools
favor English history and literature.
   Mawhinney said working parties would be set up to chart a common
curriculum. But that won't be easy, since key episodes of Irish
history are highly contentious.
   The Battle of the Boyne in 1688, for instance, is a glorious
event in Protestant minds, because it established Protestant
hegemony in Ireland. To Catholics, it was a disaster.
   But, according to Robin Glendinning, a teacher at a Protestant
school, students tend to absorb a neutral version of history while
simultaneously continuing to believe myths that directly conflict
with the facts.
   ``The facts and myths that kids hold on to are two entirely
separate areas,'' he said in an interview.
   Said Carol Nobel, an 18-year-old student at the Protestant
Grosevenor high school: ``However much we all pretend that we're
objective, it's still in you _ you still have a bias. You grew up
with it.''
   Mawhinney stressed that the government had no intention of
forcing integration, since Northern Ireland's population
distribution makes it impossible to set up integrated schools in
some areas.
   Only 1,000 of the country's 350,000 students now attend
integrated schools. Mawhinney predicted the percentage will increase
but said the government wasn't setting any targets.
   ``Integrated education is not a panacea for Northern Ireland's
future,'' Mawhinney said in an interview.
   ``Nevertheless, as more children go through the process, it's
bound to have an effect on society and we think that effect will be
positive and make it easier to tackle the political and security and
economic problems that this province faces.''
   Criticism from both Catholics and Protestants has been muted so
far.
   Monsignor Colm McCaughan, director of the Council for Catholic
Maintained Schools, said he had no objection to parents voluntarily
sending their children to mixed schools, but did not believe
integration would solve the province's difficulties.
   ``I think society itself has to be integrated before there'll be
any real change,'' he added. ``Political affiliations play a much
stronger role than religious affiliations.''
   McCaughan said it was impossible to integrate schools in the
urban ghettos where violence is most prevalent and where religiously
mixed classes might be most beneficial.
   The main opposition from the Catholic church and from some
Protestant politicians is the government's plan to give financial
preference to integrated schools.
   Mawhinney said the government wants to provide ``a very small
element of retrospective justice'' to integrated schools, which do
not qualify for government support until they have proved themselves
viable over a period of several years.
   Flanagan said Lagan College, founded in 1981 and the oldest of
the province's integrated schools, was not a ``social experiment''
or the answer to Northern Ireland's problems, but a symbol of what
is possible.
   ``Young people can live together, their parents can live together
and they don't just have to be nice, middle-class parents who play
golf and go to rugby clubs,'' he said. ``It can be done and we are
showing the way.''
   Flanagan said students will leave Lagan as mildly or as
militantly Protestant or Catholic as when they arrived, but
``capable of understanding, respecting, the point of view of the
other person because they know that other person as a person.''

   In the unstable world of acting, Tess Harper has
come to appreciate a sure thing.
   ``It's hard to establish a routine as an actor,'' said Harper,
who broke onto the movie scene five years ago playing opposite
Robert Duvall in ``Tender Mercies.''
   ``You can only be certain that this job is going to end and
you're going to have get another one. That's why people go into soap
operas or television series: It's safe.''
   So when playwright-actor Sam Shepard offered her a part in the
comedy-drama ``Far North,'' which he wrote and directed, Harper
accepted without even reading the script.
   ``It was just the thrill of being asked by him because I respect
his opinion greatly. I felt honored that my capabilities matched up
to his writing,'' she said.
   Harper's journey to Hollywood began in Mammoth Springs, Ark.,
with detours through Springfield, Mo., Houston and Dallas. Mammoth
Springs, where she lived until leaving for college in the late
1960s, has a population of just under 1,200.
   ``I certainly knew where the road leading out of town was, but I
left reluctantly,'' she recalled. ``You grow up in a place where
nothing ever changes and the thing you become most afraid of in your
life is any change.''
   But since leaving her hometown, Harper has faced changes, many
changes. She attended Southwest Missouri State in Springfield, moved
to Houston and became involved with the local theater.
   ``Sometimes I directed, sometimes I was the stage manager,'' she
recalled. ``The thing about doing that type of theater is you're
involved on every level. You might have the lead in one show and
work box office the next.''
   In the early '80s, Harper moved to Dallas, determined to further
her career. After making commercials and industrial films, the
casting director for ``Tender Mercies'' spotted her and recommended
that she be tested for the young widow who falls in love with a
country-and-western singer (Duvall).
   ``It was like winning the lottery,'' said Harper, now a resident
of Beverly Hills, Calif. ``(Director Bruce) Beresford and Duvall
treated me as if I knew precisely what I was doing. If they had any
doubts, they kept it to themselves.''
   Harper's lucky streak continued when she landed a small role in
the enormously successful ``Silkwood,'' which starred Cher, Meryl
Streep and Kurt Russell. She has also appeared in two TV miniseries,
``Chiefs'' and ``Celebrity,'' and the film ``Flashpoint.''
   In 1986, Harper appeared in the movie adaptation of Beth Henley's
play, ``Crimes of the Heart,'' which starred Diane Keaton, Jessica
Lange and Sissy Spacek as the eccentric McGrath sisters.
   ```Crimes' was summer camp and we had such a great time with each
other,'' said Harper, whose portrayal of the meddlesome cousin Chick
earned her an Academy Award nomination for supporting actress.
   ``I think it was easier for me because I was the only supporting
role and here were these three women in the leads. Every time those
women work anywhere you have to watch because their work is so
exceptional,'' she said.
   Harper developed close friendships with Lange and Shepard, who
also had a supporting role in ``Crimes,'' and was happy to have the
chance to work with them again.
   ``I knew it would be a really good working relationship. You form
a community. If you trust the people you're with then you know the
community is going to be there.''
   In ``Far North,'' Lange and Harper are sisters, who battle each
other and their father (Charles Durning), as they struggle to find
direction in their lives.
   ``What I liked about the character was her anger. I've always
played very sane, very earthy characters. The character of Rita
isn't focused at all. She's taking a break from her life.''
Something Harper can directly relate to.
   ``I've done it, but it doesn't last very long. My ability to pity
myself has about an eight-week limit.''
   Although Harper thinks of acting as a ``joyful experience,'' she
confesses to usually coming down with a strong case of nerves before
starting any film.
   ``There comes a time before shooting or rehearsals where I panic
and think I'm no good and the project's no good. But if you're
lucky, the feeling doesn't last very long.''
   And how nervous could she be about making ``Far North,'' with
Shepard writing and directing and Lange co-starring? Well, the
actual story was just fine, but Harper worried about getting it on
film because of weather conditions in Minnesota where the movie was
shot.
   ``Hopefully everytime you walk on the set, you're going to learn
something from somebody,'' the actress said. ``I would be perfectly
happy to do Sam Shepard-Bruce Beresford films for the rest of my
life.''

<HEAD>America's Favorite Acting Preppy Takes to the Stage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Edward Herrmann, America's favorite acting preppy,
is once again wearing a suit and tie onstage, but that's an
occupational hazard when you're thin and well-educated and take
naturally to the look.
   ``I can wear a suit; it's the kiss of death,'' joked Herrmann,
who dons one nightly opposite Alec Guinness in Lee Blessing's
two-character play ``A Walk in the Woods,'' now at the Comedy
Theater.
   He plays an American arms negotiator named Honeyman strolling
through the woods of Geneva enmeshed in talks with his Soviet
counterpart, Andrey Botvinnik, played by Guinness.
   ``I don't know how I got stuck in this preppy mold,'' said the
actor, who specializes in playing the clenched, close-to-the-chest
emotions that go with Honeyman's starched, well-heeled appearance.
   He played similar types as T.S. Eliot in the 1984 play ``Tom and
Viv'' and as Brock, the stuffy upper-class Briton, in David Hare's
``Plenty,'' opposite Kate Nelligan, for which both he and Nelligan
received Tony nominations.
   He played Franklin Delano Roosevelt in two TV movies, with Jane
Alexander as Eleanor.
   ``I didn't go to prep school. If anything, after playing FDR, I
was afraid I was going to be typed in comedies, loony comedies,''
said Herrmann.
   Herrmann, 45, turned up for an interview at a Chelsea pub dressed
in the natty style his latest role demands. ``The character in the
play wears a tie, and there's a value in keeping in the clothes you
are going to play in,'' he said.
   He took the role solely for the chance of acting opposite the
great Guinness, having turned down offers to do it at the Yale
Repertory Theater in New Haven, and on Broadway last February.
   ``When I heard Sir Alec wanted to do it, it was something I
wanted to put my hat in the ring for,'' said Herrmann. ``The way
Alec does it, it's just a charmer.''
   Robert Prosky and Sam Waterston performed ``A Walk in the Woods''
for four months in New York, where it received a Tony nomination for
best play. The British production, directed by Ronald Eyre, received
mixed reviews for the writing but near-raves for the stars. Herrmann
is contracted for six months plus a British tour if Guinness is
willing.
   A New York stage veteran, Herrmann won a 1976 Tony for ``Mrs.
Warren's Profession'' at Lincoln Center. He appeared last winter
with Al Pacino and Martin Sheen in ``Julius Caesar,'' the second in
Joseph Papp's series of Shakespeare productions at the Public
Theater.
   All three actors, and the production itself, were panned.
   Said Herrmann: ``I was crushed. I'd been vain about my ability to
speak blank verse because I really could, (and) the other guys
didn't know what it was.''
   But after the reviews, he said, ``I banged my head around for a
long time.''
   He has been banging about on-screen, as well.
   A familiar movie face for over a decade, he appeared in ``A
Little Sex,'' ``Annie'' and ``Reds'' and, more recently, in
``Overboard,'' ``The Lost Boys,'' and the Bette Midler-Lily Tomlin
comedy ``Big Business.''
   The latter movies offered the chance to play ``three absolutely
whacked-out people,'' especially the role of a vampire in ``Lost
Boys.''
   ``People asked, `Aren't you afraid of playing a vampire?''' he
recalled. ``Are you kidding? I'd kill to play a vampire. It was
great.''
   Herrmann likes equally working in movies and theater.
   ``Acting is acting. It's just the way you pitch it,'' he said.
``In a movie, the room is the size of the room. On the stage, the
room is the size of the stage. It's a question, I think, of
technique rather than difference in kind. You just have to use a
different set of muscles.''
   Herrmann studied on a Fulbright scholarship to the London Academy
of Music and Dramatic Art in 1968-69.
   ``England has had a big influence on my life; I feel very at home
here,'' he said. ``They listen much better here. They're keyed to
language.
   ``(But) that has its dangers. They've seen so much theater, they
may not be aware you're trying something really new. They may expect
a performance to fit a certain pattern.''

<HEAD>Prestigious Production Makes TNT Debut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ted Turner is living up to his promise to produce
high-quality, original programming for his new TNT Network.
   The prestigious premiere of such programming is ``A Man for All
Seasons,'' making its debut Wednesday and starring Charlton Heston,
Vanessa Redgrave and Sir John Gielgud.
   The screenplay was written by three-time Academy Award winner
Robert Bolt, based on his play. Bolt won Oscars for ``Lawrence of
Arabia,'' ``Dr. Zhivago'' and the 1966 film version of ``A Man for
All Seasons.'' He also wrote the screenplays for the films ``Ryan's
Daughter'' and ``The Mission.'' Besides best screenplay, ``A Man for
All Seasons'' won Academy Awards for best picture, best actor (Paul
Scofield) and best photography.
   It would be reasonable to wonder, why would anyone want to remake
such a success? But this interpretation, nicely directed by Heston,
merits the effort; it is faster and wittier, closer to the play. For
instance, it restores the dramatic stage device of The Common Man
(Roy Kinnear), a comic character who whispers to the other
characters and directly addresses the audience.
   ``It was our goal to be the first to film the play as originally
written,'' said producer Fraser C. Heston, the actor's son.
   The story surrounds the conflict between King Henry VIII and Sir
Thomas More, one of the king's most trusted advisers. More loses his
position and eventually his life, because he refuses to surrender
his personal convictions even in the face of public duty.
   ``Individual versus social responsibility is the constant
question posed in a democratic society,'' Heston says, according to
TNT publicity. ``Because the play makes an unavoidably contemporary
statement, it is truly a play for all seasons. When Robert Bolt sat
down to write `A Man for All Seasons,' God must have whispered in
his ear.''
   Heston, like some other older actors, has been reduced of late to
guest-starring on night-time soap operas and TV movies. He obviously
relishes this juicy role. The movie was shot in England at Pinewood
Studios and at historical locations, including Hampton Court Palace,
Henry VIII's home.
   The movie was filmed in a brief 19 days, a feat made possible by
the fact that Heston and most of the cast, excepting Redgrave and
Gielgud, had just completed a sold-out run of the play in London.
   Redgrave is superb as feisty Lady Alice More, an ultimately
tragic figure who loses everything because of her stubborn husband.
Heston and Redgrave had worked together on the stage in ``Macbeth''
a decade ago. Gielgud is in the movie only briefly as Cardinal
Wolsey, who dies early in the story.
   Martin Chamberlain does his best as Henry VIII, but next to the
taller, charismatic Heston, he isn't as imposing as he should be.
   As the story opens, Wolsey warns More he'll be expected to
support Henry, in defiance of the pope, in seeking a divorce from
his wife, Catherine, because she cannot produce a male heir. More, a
devout Roman Catholic, decides to avoid a conflict by not commenting
on the matter. But ultimately, the king views his silence as
condemnation.
   Early in the film, Henry comes to More's home.
   ``Why does Your Grace need my poor support?'' More asks.
   ``Because you are honest,'' the king says. ``And more to the
point, you are known to be honest.''
   Lady Alice is concerned that her husband has irreparably angered
the king.
   ``Set your mind at rest,'' Thomas tells her. ``This is not the
stuff of which martyrs are made.''
   Eventually, however, More carries his convictions to the
executioner.

   In their latest and most likely final offer, the
management of RJR Nabisco Inc. offered shareholders $8 billion more
for their shares than in their first offer.
   What is $8 billion?
   Among other things, it is the asset value of a company the size
of Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co., including about 180 plants
and 370 sales offices and distribution centers in 49 countries.
   Or it is the assets of Georgia-Pacific Corp., which owns or has
cutting rights to 5.6 million acres of North American timberlands _
plus Morton Thiokol Inc., the aerospace contractor, and a few
hundred million dollars in change.
   Had shareholders accepted the first offer, which was publicized
as being in their interest, they would have, so to speak, left that
much on the table.
   It is because of such mind-boggling considerations as these that
aspects of the RJR Nabisco sale will be debated well into the next
century, and perhaps as long as business schools exist.
   Did shareholders get a fair deal? It would seem so, since the
stock leaped in a few weeks from $55 a share to more than $90. But
even after such good fortune, some shareholders might not be as
happy as you might think.
   A good many RJR Nabisco shareholders were long-term investors
with an eye on the steady dividends of 5 percent or so a year, which
they had expected to continue well into the future.
   These investors were not traders or sellers. RJR Nabisco was, to
them, a source of income. Suddenly, they have capital gains taxes to
pay which, when combined with state taxes, could approach 40 percent.
   What does the precipitous sale of an established company mean to
holders of bonds? Big losses. Bonds purchased when the company's
debt position was strong have, inevitably, lost value as the company
becomes burdened with debt.
   The questions drive at the very meaning of a company.
   Is a corporation a dynamic, ever-changing institution whose value
_ to its immediate owners or to society at large _ lies in its
unique ability to produce products and services?
   Or is it to be viewed as a static entity, like a consumer product
on a shelf, to be sold, and in the selling lose all its future value
as a creator of change, a payer of dividends, an employer, a
taxpayer, a producer?
   How is the RJR Nabisco management to be viewed, or in fact the
management of any company that promises to serve the shareholders,
creditors, employees and customers, but which plots to take the
company for its own portfolio?
   The meaning of ``insider trading,'' a term used commonly to
describe those outsiders who gain access to inside information and
use it for their own financial gain, might have to be reconsidered.
   Consider that prior to making their announcements, buyout
managements use privileged information to construct their offer.
They allow investors to buy bonds, knowing that those bonds will
fall in value on their announcement.
   Is it proper for management to arrange for the continuance of
their salaries, plus benefits, bonuses and lucrative pensions should
they fail in their takeover attempt and instead fall prey to a
hostile offer?
   Is an insider takeover and dismantling a proper end for a
thriving company built on the savings, sacrifices and ingenuity of
entrepreneurs, the millions of man-hours of labor, the years of
risks, the hard times conquered?
   In comparison, what sacrifices, ingenuity, labor, risks and hard
times are incurred by a management that benefits from its failure,
i.e. that puts the company on the block because it thinks it might
be better dead than alive?
   The debate is only beginning.

<HEAD>Ecuador Now Crossroads for World Cocaine Trade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MONTE HAYES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This muggy port city has become the
base of operations for Colombian drug gangs that are turning tiny
Ecuador, a nation of just 10 million people, into a crossroads for
the world cocaine trade.
   In the last two years the amount of Colombian cocaine flowing
through the Andean nation en route to the United States and Europe
has increased dramatically, according to Ecuadorean narcotics police
and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).
   Officials also fear Colombia's drug barons are seeking to use
Ecuador to launder their huge cocaine profits and to invest in
legitimate enterprises.
   ``The enormous profits from drug trafficking have converted it
into an octopus whose tentacles are threatening to strangle
Ecuador,'' President Leon Febres Cordero said in May, three months
before his term ended.
   John Powell, head of DEA operations in Ecuador, estimated that 30
to 50 tons of cocaine will have been smuggled into and out of
Ecuador by the end of this year.
   ``Just in the first six months of this year, there's been over 5
tons of cocaine seized in other countries that we know came through
Ecuador,'' Powell said in an interview.
   The significance of the figures can be seen in U.S. estimates
that 72 tons of cocaine are consumed annually in the United States.
   Colombia's drug lords have diverted much of their cocaine through
Ecuador after narcotics officials in the United States and Europe
began searching Colombian planes and ships more thoroughly, say
police and U.S. drug officers.
   Ecuador is wedged between Peru and Colombia on the northwest
shoulder of South America. Peru is the world's largest grower of
coca leaf, the raw material of cocaine; Colombia is home to the drug
cartels that control the world's cocaine trade.
   ``If you put pressure on in one place, the traffickers have to go
somewhere else, and Ecuador is handy,'' Powell said. ``They've been
using it for a while anyway to get coca paste from Peru to Colombia
for processing.''
   The seizures of pure cocaine smuggled in containers aboard
freighters from Guayaquil this year include:
   _5,129 pounds discovered in a chocolate shipment at Newark, N.J.,
in June. It was the largest cocaine seizure ever made by U.S.
authorities outside Florida.
   _2,860 pounds discovered by U.S. federal agents in April in Port
Everglades, Fla. It was buried in a shipment of frozen fruit pulp to
prevent detection by dogs trained to sniff out drugs.
   _759 pounds found hidden between the wood paneling of
prefabricated walls shipped in March to Barcelona, Spain. It was one
of the largest seizures of cocaine ever made in Europe.
   Since 1986 U.S. customs officials also have seized five
Ecuatoriana cargo and passenger planes that have landed in Miami and
New York with cocaine hidden aboard. The state-owned airline has had
to pay more than $4 million in fines to gain the release of the
planes.
   ``Ecuador is beginning to feel the breath of the Colombian
mafia,'' said Col. Gustavo Gallegos, head of Interpol in Ecuador.
   The menace of the mafia also is seen in the attempt to convert
Ecuador into a major money-laundering country.
   ``Because of its bank secrecy laws, this is an ideal place to
launder drug profits,'' Powell said.
   Ecuadorean bankers estimate that $200 million to $400 million in
cocaine money will have entered Ecuador by the end of this year,
either for laundering or for investment in legitimate businesses.
   ``That's a lot of money coming into a small country like Ecuador.
It can have a corrupting influence,'' Powell said.
   Newspapers have complained in recent editorials about Colombian
drug money corrupting judges and driving up the price of real estate.
   Tracking down the source of the money is complicated by the fact
that investments by apparently legitimate Colombian companies have
also increased sharply in the last few years.
   Ecuador's largest brewery is among the most recent and prominent
of the Colombian purchases.
   Some 120,000 Colombian tourists are expected to visit Ecuador
this year, making it hard for Ecuador's narcotics police to keep
track of suspicious visitors.
   ``Colombian traffickers enter here easily with false identities.
They buy property, open businesses,'' Interpol's Gallegos said in an
interview in Quito, the highland capital. ``Once they are set up,
with everything in legal order, they begin to export cocaine.''
   Authorities are investigating some 20 Guayaquil export companies
bought by Colombians in the past year, including the firm that
shipped cocaine in containers of chocalate to the United States.
   Febres Cordero, the former president, is credited by U.S.
narcotics officials with destroying nearly all the coca plantations
that Colombian cocaine traffickers tried to set up several years ago
in remote jungle regions bordering Colombia.
   Powell said U.S. officials are confident Ecuador's new president,
Rodrigo Borja, and his police officials will try to ``outperform''
the Febres Cordero government in the drug war.
   ``They see narcotics as a threat to the stability of the
government,'' he said. ``It doesn't take any genius to look next
door to Peru or Colombia to see the disastrous effects the cocaine
trade has had on those countries.''

<HEAD>East Germany Launches Censorship Drive Against Soviet Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany, once the Soviet Union's staunchest
ideological ally, has embarked on an unprecedented campaign of
censorship aimed at bridling the spread of the Kremlin's new reform
policies.
   The seriousness of the campaign became clear Nov. 20 when East
Germany's Communist government slapped a first-ever, open-ended ban
on a Soviet publication, a magazine called Sputnik.
   The campaign has pitted East Germany's aging and conservative
leaders in the most dramatic form yet against reformers in the
Soviet Union, whose re-examinations of Soviet history have led to a
public debate on a scale unheard of in East Germany.
   East German leaders have long resisted President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, and other reforms, on
grounds that such critical discussions of problems in East Germany
are unnecessary.
   Recent speeches by Communist Party leaders have reiterated the
government's rejection of the Soviet reforms course.
   However, the recent actions have signaled the boldest moves yet
by the government to distance itself from the debate in Moscow and
to insulate the nation's population from the popular changes.
   Gorbachev's policies enjoy enormous support among East Germans
who hope his influence will bring about change in one of Eastern
Europe's most tightly controlled societies.
   East German party leaders have occasionally blocked the
distribution of newspapers from Warsaw Pact neighbors in the past _
during the 1968 Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia and the early
periods of labor unrest in Poland.
   Selected issues of Soviet magazines have also been blocked. But
until the decision on the monthly magazine Sputnik, no outright ban
had ever been imposed on a Soviet magazine.
   The decision was followed quickly with an order removing five
Soviet films dealing with Stalinist themes from theaters across the
country.
   Authorities also canceled an East Berlin cabaret production that
poked fun at the government's reluctance to accept Gorbachev's
reform policies.
   The banning of Sputnik followed its publication of articles
critical of the late Josef Stalin and Germany's communists before
Adolf Hitler took power in Germany in 1933.
   Stalin, who died in 1953, holds a special place in official East
Germany as a liberator in World War II and as the Soviet leader who
helped found the new communist nation in 1949.
   East German leaders were outraged over an article in Sputnik's
October issue that suggested that Stalin ``had been a mere puppet of
Hitler'' after the two nation's signed a mutual non-aggression pact
in 1939 and that Germany's communists had indirectly aided Hitler's
rise to power by not ``joining together with Social Democrats'' to
stop him.
   The Sputnik article also charged that German communists followed
``Stalin's order to stop all anti-fascist propaganda'' after the
pact was signed.
   Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941.
   Distribution of the October Sputnik was ordered halted shortly
after it appeared in East Germany.
   ``These (historical) issues go to the very root of their
(communist East German leaders') existence,'' said Stefan Heym, a
prominent East German author, told The Associated Press in East
Berlin.
   ``These (articles) upset the picture of the world they want to
depict.'
   Erich Honecker, the East German leader, along with a substantial
number of the nation's ruling Politburo members were members of the
prewar German Communist Party and pride themselves on having fought
fascism.
   Honecker was imprisoned by the Nazis and thousands of communists
were slain. Shortcomings of the movement or of party leaders at the
time have not been a matter for debate in the East German media.
   In an article defending the Sputnik ban, the Communist Party
organ Neues Deutschland charged that the publication ``not only
distorts Soviet history, but the history of the German Communist
Party.''
   ``The magazine, and we say this openly, defames German
communists.''
   While carefully emphazing that Sputnik was ``not an official
organ'' of the Soviet Communist Party, Neues Deutchland added that
``distorted visions of Soviet history, distributed here, are
incompatible with our friendship with the Soviet Union.''
   Soviet officials defended the magazine, saying it ``mirrors a
plurality of opinion in the Soviet press.''

<HEAD>A Strategic Arms Nudge, Not a Breakthrough, Is What's Expected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, who have
made arms control history together, are bound to revisit their idea
of a dramatic reduction in strategic weapons when they meet over
lunch this week, but a nudge forward, rather than a breakthrough, is
the most that's likely to result.
   The strategic arms reduction treaty that they have been talking
about _ the hoped-for centerpiece in Reagan's arms control program _
has too many holes in it for Gorbachev and Reagan to reach command
decisions during their three-hour luncheon Wednesday on Governors
Island in New York Harbor.
   Moreover, Gorbachev is well aware that he is dealing with a lame
duck president who will have six weeks left in office and will be in
no position to commit his successor, George Bush, to any course of
action.
   For all that, Max M. Kampelman, the chief U.S. arms control
negotiator, finds it difficult to believe arms will not come up
during lunch.
   ``I believe it will come up,'' Kampelman said in an interview
last week. ``But I don't believe it will come up in a negotiating
context. My own judgment is it will come up as a discussion and
maybe a quick review of where things stand now.''
   Kampelman added: ``And I guess perhaps an expression on both
sides they hope to finish the work. I cannot myself envisage any
detailed discussion of the arms negotiations taking place.''
   The unfinished treaty will be turned over to President-elect
Bush's administration with, the U.S. side hopes, a renewed
commitment from Gorbachev to maintain its current high priority.
   Reagan intends to raise arms control issues with the Soviet
leader, just as he will bring up the suspended Red Army withdrawal
from Afghanistan and the human rights situation, officials say.
   But the vital ground work simply has not been undertaken this
time. For example, Secretary of State George P. Shultz did not have
a planning session with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to
set an agenda and to define the issues for their leaders.
   Arms negotiations were adjourned in Geneva, Switzerland, on Nov.
15 and the two sides have not met since.
   They ended the 10th round of talks agreeing to an early
resumption in 1989. The United States subsequently proposed Feb. 15.
The Soviets did not respond.
   Reagan and Bush probably will have Shultz and a handful of other
senior U.S. officials at the luncheon table with them. But the U.S.
and Soviet arms control experts who normally labor over the details
while the leaders hold their summits plan no such sessions.
   Shultz has predicted a ``substantive'' discussion. Another U.S.
official, mindful of Gorbachev's innovative style, remarked, ``You
never can tell.''
   But the hard fact is that the treaty to reduce U.S. and Soviet
armories of long-range bombers, missiles and submarines by 30 to 50
percent is still mired in disagreement on several key points.
   The two sides have not decided, for instance, whether to include
mobile missiles or sea-launched cruise missiles. Both are extremely
hard to track. That means cutbacks are hard to verify. The room for
cheating is uncomfortably wide.
   The Soviets, meanwhile, still would like to restrict Reagan's
Strategic Defense Initiative as part of a treaty deal. The $4
billion-a-year program is designed to stop ballistic missiles in
space, but critics here and in Moscow say it could extend the arms
race to a new and dangerous sphere.
   Then there is the fact a new U.S. administration is coming
aboard, one that may not share the outgoing administration's views
on reducing strategic weapons.
   Brent Scowcroft, designated by Bush to be his national security
adviser, is worried that large cutbacks in U.S. strategic weapons
could make the Warsaw Pact's edge in conventional forces in Europe
more significant.
   He also is concerned that reducing the U.S. arsenal of land-based
intercontinental ballistic missiles could expose those that remain
to a higher risk of being destroyed in the event of a Soviet attack.
   Bush will be at the table, deferring to Reagan. ``It will be
President Reagan's meeting,'' he said.
   And yet Reagan will be aware that, in a sense, he will be
speaking also for Bush and should not commit his successor to
positions he may not want to take after Jan. 20.

   Huge grain surpluses resembling the ones that
ushered in the rural crisis of the early 1980s could be just around
the corner despite current drought-reduced supplies, warns a leading
government economist.
   ``The drought has altered the immediate outlook, but in a world
of subsidized agriculture, the long-term tendency to overproduction
lurks only slightly below the surface,'' said Ewen M. Wilson,
undersecretary of agriculture for economics.
   Because of the summer drought, the world witnessed the steepest
decline in grain stocks ever recorded, he acknowledged in remarks to
the department's annual Agricultural Outlook Conference last week.
   The 29 percent plunge in U.S. grain production _ more than a
third of the nation's corn and over half of the spring wheat crop _
turned markets upside down. Banished were surpluses and bargain
basement prices. Tight supplies and steep prices became the rule.
   According to Wilson, however, the change has sent pessimists
scurrying to the works of Thomas Malthus, the 18th century
philospher who predicted almost 200 years ago that global population
would outrun the planet's food supply.
   ``Today's Malthusians say that we have reached a plateau in
agricultural productivity _ that the easy gains in crop yields have
been won and that future gains will be diminished,'' he said.
``Furthermore they say that environmental degradation will further
constrain productivity and that the advances of biotechnology are
years away.''
   In fact, said Wilson, farm productivity has increased 30 percent
in the last decade alone. At that rate, farmers and the government
will be wrestling with surpluses of 1.4 billion bushels of corn, 320
million bushels of wheat and 200 million bushels of soybeans, even
if no land idled under the 1985 farm law is returned to production.
   ``There is little reason to believe that the pace of
technological improvement in agriculture will slow in the years
ahead,'' Wilson said. ``If anything, dramatic breakthroughs are on
the horizon. Within the next few years, biotechnology will move from
the laboratory into commercial use, potentially offering new plant
varieties resistant to insects, heat, drought, frost and disease.''
   ``The bottom line is that underlying fundamentals may have been
masked but they have not been changed by the 1988 drought,'' he said.
   American agriculture has long been plagued by a chronic excess
capacity, Wilson said. He cited a study by USDA's Economic Research
Service which showed 9 percent excess capacity for all of the
nation's agriculture in the 1980s and more than 20 percent for major
program crops such as corn and wheat.
   ``The fact is, agricultural productivity continues to outpace the
growth in demand for agricultural products,'' he said. ``The danger
today is that policymakers will be misled by the present tightness
in global grain supplies brought about by the drought.''
   ``Analysts have always been swayed by conditions prevailing at
the time they make their estimates, and they have frequently
underestimated the capacity of farmers to expand production,'' he
said. ``But history has demonstrated time and time again that when
prices give the signal to expand output, farmers invariably
respond.''
   For a number of reasons, the rebuilding of stocks this time may
be gradual rather than sudden, Wilson said. He cited an eventual
removal of 40 million acres from production by the Conservation
Reserve Program. The lower dollar sends U.S. commodities overseas at
a brisker pace. Growing economies overseas, especially in the
Pacific Rim countries, represent expanding markets for American farm
goods.
   ``Despite these caveats, I believe it would be a great mistake to
ignore long-term fundamentals,'' Wilson said. ``Barring another
drought, the odds are in favor of a rebound in production and a
rebuilding of stocks.''
   ``Even if this rebuilding is gradual, it underlines the
importance of the reforms that have been proposed by the United
States for agriculture in the Uruguay Round of General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade negotiations,'' he added.
   In the talks, the United States has proposed a gradual phaseout
of agricultural subsidies, a proposal that has thus far failed to
arouse much enthusiasm in Europe.
   ``In the absence of such reform,'' said Wilson, ``it will be
difficult to avoid a return to the costly and wasteful agricultural
surpluses that have plagued us in the past.''

<TEXT>
   Maybe it will be called the lunchtime summit.
Maybe it will be called the ultimate power lunch. Maybe it will just
be called a meeting.
   Ever since the White House announced that President Reagan,
President-elect George Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
would break bread in New York on Dec. 7, people have been talking
about what to call the get-together.
   It often has been the case that officials have been relucant to
label such a meeting a summit beforehand, saying this would raise
expectations that would not then be fulfilled.
   On the other hand, skeptics note that meetings that have been
billed as non-summits have turned into full-fledged international
confrontations fraught with consequence.
   Webster's New World Dictionary defines summit as follows: ``in
connection with diplomatic negotiations, the level restricted to
heads of government.''
   That would make the New York lunch a summit if there was any
negotiating, but the White House insists there won't be. Officials
say there are no plans for the working groups and expanded teams for
plenary sessions that customarily accompany world leaders to a
summit.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater tried to make the point
four times in a 34-minute briefing on Nov. l4 that the New York
session would not be the kind of high-powered conclave that Winston
Churchill christened ``a parley at the summit.''
   ``This would not be a summit meeting in any traditional sense,''
Fitzwater said.
   ``It's not a summit,'' he said.
   ``A summit would, by definition, I think have to be more
prepared,'' he said.
   ``This is just a very cordial meeting to say hello and goodbye,
if you will,'' he said.
   As if all this weren't enough, Reagan himself chimed in within
the hour, saying, ``That isn't anything in the nature of a summit
meeting,'' and, ``I can only tell you it is not going to be a
summit.''
   Two weeks later, Secretary of State George P. Shultz described
the session as ``a meeting at the summit.'' Fitzwater, however,
noted that the meeting was expected to last less than three hours
and added, ``I think it is pretty hard to characterize that as a
summit at least in any traditional sense.''
   Despite the White House assurances, it was hard to forget that
both the U.S. and Soviet sides claimed beforehand that the
Reagan-Gorbachev meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland, in October 1986 was
not a summit.
   But the meeting took up sweeping nuclear arms control proposals,
ended in a wrangle over Reagan's Star Wars system of space-based
missile defense, and has been called a summit ever since.

   President Reagan and Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev are meeting Wednesday for the fifth time, at a luncheon in
New York.
   They will be joined at the table by President-elect George Bush.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the session ``will
ensure that the momentum and continuity of the arms control talks
are extended and it will reaffirm the relations between the general
secretary and the new president of the United States as we enter the
decade of the '90s.''
   Officials said subjects would include the suspended Soviet troop
withdrawal from Afghanistan, with the United States seeking
assurances that the troops will be out on schedule. They said the
agenda for arms control and human rights talks would also be raised.
   Here, in brief, is a look at the previous Reagan-Gorbachev
summits.

   The two leaders met on Nov. 19 and 21, exchanging enthusiastic
handshakes and champagne toasts before getting down to business.
   When the meeting was over, they had agreed to hold summits in
1986 in Washington and 1987 in Moscow and to give impetus to arms
control talks, aiming at 50 percent reductions in nuclear weapons.
   Reagan said in advance of the meeting that he would press
Gorbachev on human rights and regional conflicts, but documents
after the summit and statements by the leaders indicated little sign
of movement.
   Agreements were reached on cultural exchanges, air safety,
additional consulates, increased air travel and cooperation on
energy.
   Both sides said they favored a complete prohibition of chemical
weapons as well as destruction of existing stockpiles, a goal that
still has not been reached although an international conference is
forthcoming.
   The two sides failed to reach any agreement on Reagan's Star Wars
plan of space-based missile defense, on extension of the Salt II
treaty, on divided families or on a joint venture in space.

   Moscow broke off pre-summit talks after the U.S. bombing of Libya
in April, 1986, dooming any chance of a summit in Washington that
year, but the Soviets and the White House announced Sept. 30 that
Reagan and Gorbachev would meet Oct. 11 and 12 in the Icelandic
capital.
   Reagan told reporters, ``This is not a summit,'' saying it was
designed only to pave the way for summit meetings in Washington and
Moscow. Spokesman Larry Speakes said, ``We will be satisfied with
the Iceland meetings if we accomplish better understanding.''
   The meetings ended in misunderstanding, with U.S. officials
proclaiming themselves ``deeply disappointed'' because potential
arms agreements vanished when the two leaders reached an impasse on
testing of Star Wars weaponry. The administration later sought to
paint the outcome in brighter hues, with Reagan saying it left the
superpowers ``closer than ever'' to an unprecedented cut in nuclear
arsenals.
   Four months after the summit, the Democratic-controlled House
Armed Services Committee said in a report that there remained ``an
astonishing degrees of confusion surrounding what actually
happened'' at Reykjavik. The report said sweeping U.S. proposals for
deep reductions in nuclear arms were presented without advance study
by the Pentagon.
   Disagreement remains over the events of Reykjavik. On Nov. 15,
the day plans were announced for the latest Reagan-Bush-Gorbachev
meeting, the president was asked how the United States would react
if Gorbachev brought proposals, as he did in Iceland. Said Reagan,
``Well, it depends on whether you're going by the public version of
Reykjavik or what actually happened there.'' He did not elaborate.

   In meetings Dec. 8-10 at the White House, the two leaders signed
an agreement to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear missiles, the
first treaty ever to eliminate an entire category of nuclear arms.
   They said they made progress but reached no agreement to curb
long-range strategic weapons and struck no deal on Soviet withdrawal
from Afghanistan, still a trouble spot in 1988 despite a
U.N.-mediated agreement by the Soviets to withdraw all troops by
Feb. 15.

   Reagan arrived in the Soviet capital May 29 for a four-day stay
that would be long on pageantry and symbolism but offer a mixed
record of accomplishment.
   A joint communique said the leaders reached ``common ground'' on
verifying the numbers of mobile missiles and cruise missiles carried
by airplanes, important elements if a strategic arms treaty is to be
reached.
   But the sides were still divided on the U.S. Star Wars program as
well as on submarine-fired missiles and reductions in conventional
forces.
   On human rights, Gorbachev said he told Reagan that ``your
explanations are not convincing ... I am not filled with admiration
at this aspect of the visit.'' Reagan has applauded recent human
rights developments in the Soviet Union, including new freedom for
dissidents such as Andrei Sakharov, while insisting that more needs
to be done.

   Children stop chattering
when the Israeli soldiers come in their trucks and riot helmets.
Young men grip stones and the faces of their elders grow grim.
   A year ago in this ramshackle refugee camp of tin shacks and
crude concrete-block houses, Palestinians began their first
sustained rebellion in 21 years of Israeli occupation. No end is in
sight.
   More than 300 Palestinians and 11 Israelis have been killed. More
than 7,000 Palestinians have been wounded. Of 20,000 arrested,
nearly 6,000 remain in jail.
   The intefadeh, the Arabic word for uprising used even by the
Israelis, has generated international sympathy and a new sense of
purpose and identity among the 1.5 million Palestinians of the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Although the Palestine Liberation Organization did not start the
rebellion, it has become deeply involved and a young underground
leadership has been formed to direct the protest.
   An Israeli election was fought largely on policy in the occupied
lands and the related question of how to achieve peace with the
Arabs. The Palestinians declared an independent state, changing the
situation irreversibly.
   On this day, schoolgirls were walking home when two trucks filled
with soldiers rumbled by in the muddy street. The grins on the
girls' faces disappeared and they fell silent, their faces blank.
   A 33-year-old man standing nearby, who said he had five children,
was asked about the future for the 50,000 people of Jabaliya.
   ``The blood will keep flowing,'' he said.
   Hardly a day goes by in the camp without a teen-ager being
wounded by soldiers who open fire on stone-throwing youngsters. On
the West Bank it is much the same.
   The revolt has spread to the Arab sector of Jerusalem, and in
small ways to Arabs who live inside Israel and are citizens of the
Jewish state.
   For many Palestinians, the revolt is a source of both pride and
dismay. The passivity of the occupation has ended but thousands of
families have a son killed or wounded, or someone imprisoned.
   Israelis view the rebellion with fear or hatred. The cars of
Jewish settlers in the occupied lands are stoned as they travel to
their homes. Some respond with gunfire.
   Jews are afraid to go to the Arab sector of Jerusalem, which the
government has annexed as part of Israel's capital.
   Parliamentary elections Nov. 1 made clear that Israelis are
deeply divided on how to deal with the Palestinians. Parties winning
seats in the 120-member Knesset advocated every solution from
trading occupied land for peace to expelling all Palestinians from
the West Bank and Gaza.
   Dedi Zucker, a member of parliament for the left-wing Citizens
Rights Movement, sees an odd unity in this and said of the two
extremes: ``In both cases, people don't believe Israelis and
Palestinians can live together in the current situation.''
   Dozens of times in the past year, Israeli officials have
interpreted a lull in the violence as evidence that the rebellion
was waning, but each time the lull has passed.
   Ephraim Sneh, former head of the West Bank military government,
wrote in the newspaper Haaretz that, despite the toll taken on
Palestinian society, ``it would be a mistake to assume it is
incapable of sustaining the intefadeh.''
   For most Palestinians, the question is not whether to continue,
but with what tactics.
   Daoud Kuttab, a leading Palestinian journalist, sees the revolt
at a crossroads _ pulled one way by those weary of trouble and
frequent general strikes and the other by those who believe only
violence will drive Israel from the occupied lands.
   Kuttab says the problem is to keep the revolt in the world's eye
without making Israel angry enough to crush it by any means
necessary.
   Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza see the great achievements
of the intefadeh as building their own pride and drawing attention
to their plight, not only in the West but among their own leaders in
PLO.
   They believe television pictures of Israeli soldiers shooting or
beating young Palestinians have had a lasting effect.
   As for the PLO, for years it declared with overblown rhetoric
that the Jews would be driven into the sea. Last month it issued a
Palestinian declaration of independence based on a U.N. resolution
that calls for creating Jewish and Arab states side by side.
   Hatem Abu Ghazali, a community leader in the West Bank city of
Nablus, sees this as a major accomplishment for Palestinians who
live with the reality of Israeli occupation rather than with dreams
of the past.
   ``We have shown international public opinion that we are looking
for peace, not only the people but the leadership of the PLO,'' he
said, adding that the response from Israel and the United States
will increase Palestinian anger and frustration.
   Israel called the PLO declarations ``doubletalk'' intended to
mask an aim of destroying Israel in stages.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz refused PLO chairman Yasser
Arafat a visa to address the United Nations in New York, and four
days later two firebombs were hurled into the compound of the U.S.
consulate in Arab east Jerusalem. They caused no damage.
   Abu Ghazali said the U.S. and Israeli responses provided ``a
hearty ideological meal'' to those who want violence, but journalist
Kuttab contended that more violence is not inevitable.
   He said the uprising's future will be decided by debate among
Palestinians and throughout the world. In the West Bank and Gaza,
however, anger often outpaces hopeful thinking.
   The intefadeh began when an Israeli army truck collided with two
Arab vans just outside Jabaliya on Dec. 8, 1987, killing four
Palestinians and injuring six.
   Rumors spread that it was not an accident, but revenge for the
slaying of an Israeli businessman three days earlier. Crowds
gathered that night and by the next day hundreds of youths were
throwing stones at Israeli soldiers.
   Then as now, the soldiers opened fire. The first to die was
Mohammed Hatem Abu Sisi, a 17-year-old high school student.
   The other day in Ramallah, a West Bank city just north of
Jerusalem, a 15-year-old named Mohammed spoke of what lies ahead for
the rebellion.
   With his light brown hair, jeans and sneakers he could have
passed for an American teen-ager, but what he said was: ``Either we
will get our state or we'll fight. Some people are prepared even to
kill Jews.''

   First Lt. Sheffy said he was
torn apart emotionally after wounding a 12-year-old Palestinian boy
with a plastic bullet.
   ``For two days, I couldn't face myself,'' the tall, dark-haired
company commander recalled. Sheffy, 23, said he and his companion on
a two-man patrol fired on hundreds of stone-throwing Palestinians
who ambushed them, wounding several.
   He estimated he had fired plastic bullets more than 100 times in
three months of almost daily street battles. A rifle with a sniper
scope was on the table in front of him.
   Sheffy says he has tried to block out his emotions so he can do
the job, and ``now it's easier. I just don't ask myself too many
questions.''
   ``I don't see myself as a hero for shooting someone,'' he said,
``but I think it is necessary to keep the situation from getting
even more violent.''
   Second Lt. Doron, a platoon leader, said constant stress and
face-to-face conflict with Palestinians make the soldiers
short-tempered and prone to quarrel.
   ``I feel there is a tendency towards more violence,'' said Doron,
who is 22 and comes from a kibbutz, or communal farm. ``It's
difficult to act one way here and differently at home.''
   Sheffy and Doron are first names. Army regulations prohibit the
use of last names of soldiers serving in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   Some Israelis fear soldiers returning from duty in the
territories will release their pent-up anger on civilians, both
Arabs and Jews.
   Israel is especially vulnerable to such side effects of conflict
because virtually all men and women are required to serve in the
military. Men do up to 62 days a year of reserve duty until age 49.
   Reuven Gal, former chief army psychologist who now heads the
private Israeli Institute for Miliary Studies, said research
indicates one effect of Israel's wars has been an increase in crime.
He said that also could be a result of the year-long Palestinian
uprising.
   ``I would not be surprised to see a sharp increase in crimes such
as beating and assault,'' along with an increase in traffic
accidents, he said.
   Gal's wife Ivria, an author, wrote a poem about how service
during the uprising changed her 20-year-old son Yoav from an
anti-war activist to a tough-minded soldier.
   ``The pictures of my son the soldier, who attended Peace Now
rallies with long hair and an earring, are on the front page of the
newspaper, and he is described as a brute occupier,'' she wrote.
``My heart is torn because I know the soul behind that picture. I
know the confusion and I know the pain.''
   When her son came home for the weekend, the poem says, she washed
the dirt from his clothes and treated his swollen feet, his blisters
and cuts, ``but I cry and my heart goes to him because who is going
to treat my son's internal wounds? Who is going to see the unseen
wound?''
   Sheffy and two of his platoon leaders spoke to a journalist in a
tent near the maze-like public market of Nablus, a focal point for
anti-Israeli violence since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987.
   They said the army faced protests by thousands of Palestinians
early in the intefadeh, the Arabic word for uprising that has been
adopted even by Israelis.
   Today, most confrontations are on a small scale _ a foot patrol
or army vehicle ambushed by half a dozen young Arabs who hurl stones
or bottles of flaming gasoline and dart into an alley.
   Two soldiers from Sheffy's elite infantry unit suffered severe
head injuries and one was partially paralyzed by large blocks of
stone dropped from rooftops.
   Saguy, a 22-year-old a second lieutenant, said men in his platoon
often wanted to get even. ``I talk to them. I tell them that revenge
is indiscriminate, that it will hurt people that have harmed no
one,'' he said.
   Such frustration has led to several instances of attacks by
soldiers on innocent bystanders.
   Army radio said 45 soldiers and officers had been tried and 15
were convicted, receiving jail sentences that ranged up to a year
for a manslaughter case.
   In November, for example, the army gave 21 paratroopers up to two
weeks in jail each for going on a rampage after their bus was stoned
in a refugee camp. The officer-cadets broke windows in 20 houses and
damaged four cars.
   Critics say one of the main problems is that occupation duty
normally is handled by specialized police forces, not young soldiers
whose training is for fighting wars.
   ``There should be a permanent force that doesn't change every
three or four weeks,'' said Aryeh Shalev, former head of the West
Bank military government. ``We should free the army from this
function. It's not a military job, it's a police job.''
   The uprising caught the army unprepared. Soldiers did not wear
helmets, did not have truncheons and were not trained in crowd
control or the use of tear gas. The result was high casualties from
live fire, which has accounted for 3,500 woundings and most of the
more than 300 Palestinian fatalities.
   Soldiers interviewed in Nablus said they are better prepared for
riots now because of new technology and a 10-day training course.
   They said the plastic bullet, introduced in September as a
non-lethal alternative to live ammunition, has made them more feared
in the street and eased their own frustration.
   ``The Arabs used to bare their chests and yell, `Shoot me!'
`Shoot me!' knowing that we had orders not to shoot unless our lives
were in danger,'' Saguy said. ``Now, we don't need to do more than
aim, and they disperse.''

<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of the most important
events in the year-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   1987
   Dec. 6 _ A Palestinian stabbed an Israeli businessman to death in
Gaza City's Palestine Square.
   Dec. 8 _ An Israeli truck collided with two vans in the Gaza
Strip, killing four Palestinians. The crash, rumored to be
retaliation for the slaying, inspired riots in the Jabaliya refugee
camp.
   Dec. 9 _ Israeli soldiers fired on protesting students in
Jabaliya after a firebomb was hurled at a patrol. Two Palestinians
were killed, the first of more than 300 to die in the first year,
and nearly 20 were wounded.
   1988
   Jan. 13 _ Israel deported four Palestinians despite international
protests. The expulsions were the first of 32 since the uprising
began.
   Jan. 20 _ Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said soldiers were to
use ``strength and blows ... force, not fire'' against protesters.
   Feb. 15 _ A Palestinian youth said he and three other residents
of a village were buried alive by Israeli soldiers using a
bulldozer. The army later acknowledged the incident and disciplined
the soldiers.
   Feb. 26 _ Four Israeli soldiers were detained after a television
crew filmed them kicking and beating two bound Arab protesters.
   April 6 _ A 15-year-old Israeli girl was killed in a clash with
Palestinians during a school hiking trip in the West Bank, the first
of 11 Israelis slain since the first riots. The shot was fired by an
Israeli guard.
   April 16 _ Khalil al-Wazir, the deputy to Palestine Liberation
Organization chief Yasser Arafat known as Abu Jihad, was
assassinated in Tunis. The assassination, which Arabs blamed on
Israel, caused violent protests in which 16 Palestinians were
killed, the highest single-day death toll.
   July 30 _ King Hussein severed Jordan's ties with the occupied
territories, giving the PLO greater responsibility for the areas.
   Nov. 1 _ Israel's national elections ended in a deadlock between
the right-wing Likud bloc and the center-left Labor Party.
   Nov. 15 _ The Palestine National Council, which acts as the PLO
legislature, declared an independent Palestinian state. Israel
rejected the declaration.

   One of history's biggest corporate bustups loomed
over RJR Nabisco Inc. after Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. seemingly
bagged the cigarette-and-food company for a record $24.53 billion.
   But the buyout specialist said Thursday it saw no urgent need to
sell anything.
   Meanwhile, a rival bidding group hinted it might reopen the
struggle, RJR's debt ratings sank, and a disgruntled big RJR
bondholder that already had sued RJR said it might sue Kohlberg, too.

   American Telephone & Telegraph Co. says it will
post the first annual loss in its 103-year history as a result of a
$6.7 billion pre-tax charge that covers the costs of scrapping
outdated equipment and moving or laying off 16,000 employees.
   Wall Street saw the giant charge, announced Thursday, as a sign
that AT&T was moving aggressively to cut costs and install a new
digital network to meet the competition. The charge will not affect
AT&T's cash flow, its ability to pay dividends or the money
available for investment.

bottling operation to Pepsico Inc. for $1.5 billion.
   Industry analysts said Thursday's move would bring one of the

   The government's main gauge of future economic
activity edged up a slight 0.1 percent in October after falling the
previous month.
   The Commerce Department said Thursday that its Index of Leading
Indicators fell by a revised 0.3 percent in September, faster than
the previous estimate of minus 0.1 percent.
   Michael Penzer, senior economist with Bank of America in San
Francisco, said the index since early 1987 has been underestimating
future growth. Nevertheless, he said, the economy probably will slow
by next spring.

   Sales for the nation's largest general retailers continued at
their now-familiar sluggish pace in November, but industry observers
say a pickup late in the month augured well for the Christmas
shopping season.
   The nation's largest retailer, Sears, Roebuck and Co., said
Thursday its overall sales were up 8.8 percent last month, while K
mart Corp. posted a 5.5 percent rise, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. sales
were up 30 percent and J.C. Penney had a 1.8 percent decline.

   An increase in single-family home construction
helped boost overall construction spending 0.9 percent in October,
the fourth consecutive monthly increase, the government says.
   The Commerce Department said Thursday that building activity rose
$3.7 billion to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $409.2 billion.
   Construction spending, which rose 0.7 percent in September and
0.2 percent in August, recently has bucked what has been a generally
lackluster building trend over the past year.

   NBC, which televised the Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea,

   The possibility of lower crude oil supplies next
year has sparked heavy futures market activity as investors move to
add more to their inventories.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the January contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, jumped
29 cents to settle at $15.61 a barrel Thursday. Other contract
months also rose.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, the
January contract for unleaded gasoline rose 0.70 cent to settle at
45.98 cents a gallon, while other contract months ended the day
mixed. Heating oil closed up 0.94 cent at 49.18 cents a gallon, and
other contracts also rose.
   Analysts said fear of shorter crude oil supplies when the new
OPEC accord takes effect convinced investors to add more to their
inventories.
   Energy brokers said trading volume was heavy with commercial
activity particulary strong. Prices seesawed throughout the day as
investors bought and sold futures and crude prices moved near $15.80
a barrel weekly high reached Monday after the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries signed a new accord to reduce its
output by some 4 million barrels a day next year.
   Traders noted that the January contract far outsold others amid
expectations that oil supplies could be sharply curtailed if OPEC
acts on its agreement.
   Helping to boost prices was ongoing speculation that several
non-OPEC oil producing nations would take an active role in helping
the cartel shrink the world oil glut.
   ``There was talk that eight producers from non-OPEC countries
would meet to discuss this,'' said Linda Simard, oil broker with
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Mexico, Oman, Malaysia and Norway are among the non-OPEC nations
that have indicated an interest in reducing their own output,
analysts said.

<HEAD>Uncertainty Surrounds RJR Nabisco Tobacco Subsidiary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By F. ALAN BOYCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ Dreams of big stock profits and the
possible return of RJR Nabisco Inc.'s corporate headquarters are
being tempered by the specter of layoffs in this tobacco community,
following the company's record buyout agreement.
   ``I think the general feeling is one of uncertainty,'' said Fred
Nordenholz, president of the Winston-Salem Chamber of Commerce.
``There are lots of mixed feelings about what's happening.''
   RJR Nabisco's $24.53 billion buyout agreement with Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co. means potentially big windfalls for the R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Co. workers and others among the 9,000 area
residents and groups that own an estimated $2 billion in RJR Nabisco
stock.
   Some local businessmen also see the possibility that RJR will
move its corporate headquarters, which left Winston-Salem for
Atlanta less than two years ago, back home again, bringing jobs and
prestige.
   But at the same time, the company is being bought with
unprecedented amounts of borrowed money, and locals expect
subsequent belt-tightening in a number of RJR operations _ including
the tobacco business _ that could include layoffs or other cutbacks
affecting them.
   ``Some people are going to have greater personal wealth than ever
before, and that's balanced by a certain amount of anxiety about
where the company's headed and what's going to happen to their
careers,'' Nordenholz said.
   John Davis, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, said stories of
production-line workers becoming millionaires as stock prices nearly
doubled in the past 50 days are ``a bit overstated.''
   ``There are some people who are suddenly quarter-millionaires, on
paper anyway,'' he said.
   But not many are packing up their bags for the Bahamas. Many
local shareholders will see their gains as a sudden windfall, but
others are looking to reinvest their profits, said Davis, a managing
partner of the investment firm Alex. Brown and Sons.
   Wade Spache, a maintenance technician at Reynolds Tobacco quoted
by the Winston-Salem Journal, said he had sold some stock earlier at
$84 a share, far below the expected $109 value of the buyout but way
above the $56 range the stock held before the bidding war began Oct.
20.
   ``I just wanted to be on the safe side,'' he said. ``I didn't
want everything I had in speculation.''
   Much of the impact on the community has been psychological.
   While many analysts have portrayed R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, the
nation's No. 2 cigarette maker, as the corporation's money-making
machine, few expect the Winston-Salem-based company to go unscathed.
   But Rick Weddle, director of Winston-Salem Business Inc., said
the impact of the buyout _ even with layoffs _ would be positive in
his firm's attempts to lure other industry to the area.
   ``I am probably one of the few people alive who sees opportunity
in employment reductions,'' he said. ``We have a fairly tight labor
market for certain types of industrial skills.''
   With local unemployment in the 3 percent range recently, it has
been difficult to benefit from expansion in the export and
manufacturing sectors, Weddle said.
   ``For us to share in that we must have all the available
ingredients,'' he said.
   When the financial smoke has cleared, Winston-Salem could be in
better shape than it was a year ago, Davis said.
   ``Tobacco is fairly recession resistant, as is most of the food
business,'' he said. ``Things may be tight for a year, 18 months.
But profits have been in the 20 to 25 percent range. ...What are you
going to do, lay people off because you're making more money? It
doesn't work that way.''
   Some employees could have lingering bitterness against F. Ross
Johnson, RJR's chief executive, Davis said. It was Johnson who moved
RJR corporate headquarters to Atlanta and who kicked off the buyout
war with his own offer to buy the company.
   ``If Ross Johnson hadn't moved headquarters to Atlanta, he'd have
had everybody rooting for management,'' Davis said.

<BYLINE>Retailers Have Slow November, But Signs Point to Good Christmas</BYLINE>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic NY43 of Dec. 1</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A post-Thanksgiving pickup in sales by the nation's biggest
general retailers is a positive sign for the important Christmas
shopping season, industry watchers say, even though sales for all of
November were sluggish.
   Sales tallied after the November reporting period _ which ended
Nov. 26 for most retailers _ showed modest improvement, ``leading us
to the general conclusion that Christmas sales will be reasonably
healthy,'' said Jeffrey Feiner, a retail industry analyst with
Merrill Lynch & Co.
   ``Based on the end-of-the-month results, one could project we're
going to have a moderately strong Christmas season,'' said Walter
Loeb, an analyst with Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc.
   Retailers earn about half their annual profits during the crucial
holiday period. But even if sales are slow, profits should improve
in the fourth quarter because retailers are keeping their
inventories tight, Ronning said.
   Many analysts predict retailers will have a 6 percent overall
increase in Christmas sales from last year. But Joseph Ronning, an
analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman Inc., warned that the sales
improvement might look better than it really is because results last
Christmas were disappointing.
   November's sales ``were on the sluggish side, very similar to the
trends we saw in September and October,'' said Jeffrey Edelman, an
analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ``The first 3{ weeks were
quite soft.''
   Retailers have had slumping sales for nearly two years as
consumers have paid more for necessities and services and tried to
reduce their high debt loads. Analysts and economists expect this
trend to continue into 1989.
   Apparel retailers, who have had a year-long sales slide,
continued their comeback last month. For example, Limited Inc., a
leading specialty apparel retailer, reported its overall November
sales rose 25 percent while sales at stores open at least a year _
known as same-store sales _ picked up 18 percent.
   The nation's largest retailer, Sears, Roebuck and Co., said its
overall sales were up 8.8 percent last month and 6.2 percent for the
first 43 weeks of the fiscal year. Sears' same-store sales rose 4.4
percent in November and 2.3 percent for the year so far.
   Retailers and industry analysts believe same-store sales are a
more accurate measure of a company's performance than figures that
include sales from new stores. Not all retailers report same-store
sales.
   K mart Corp. said its overall sales were up 5.5 percent last
month and 5.6 percent for the year to date. K mart reported its
same-store sales rose 1.4 percent for the month and 1.9 percent so
far this year.
   K mart's reporting period ended Nov. 23, so its sales report did
not reflect the beginning of the traditional Christmas season on the
day after Thanksgiving.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said its overall sales rose 30 percent
during November and 29 percent so far in 1988. The discount
retailer's same-store sales were up 13 percent for the month and 11
percent for the year to date.
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. said its overall sales fell 1.8 percent
during the month and were up just 0.1 percent over the cumulative
43-week period. Penney's same-store sales were off 3.8 percent
during November, and slipped 1.1 percent for the year to date.
   Karen Sack, an analyst with Standard & Poor's Corp., said the
decline in Penney's sales reflected the fact that the company had
discontinued several merchandise lines over the past year. Penney
said it would have recorded a gain if sales from discontinued items
were excluded from year-earlier results.
   Dayton Hudson Corp. reported its overall sales picked up 7
percent during November and 14.8 percent over the 43-week period.
The company reported same-store increases of 1.5 percent for the
month and 1.7 percent for 43 weeks.
   May Department Stores Co. said its overall sales rose 19.7
percent last month and 16 percent for the year to date. Same-store
sales rose 2.8 percent in November and 1.9 percent for the year so
far.
   F.W. Woolworth Co. said its overall sales picked up 9.3 percent
last month and 11.8 percent during the 43-week period. Same-store
sales rose 4.8 percent in November and 5.8 percent for the year to
date.
   Montgomery Ward & Co. said its sales were up 7.8 percent in
November and 3.7 percent for the 43 weeks.
   Sales for several of the big retailers continued to run well
under the rate of inflation, which has increased by 4.6 percent so
far this year.
   The results reported were from the biggest general merchandise
and apparel retailers. Unlike monthly retail sales figures released
by the federal government, they do not include sales at auto
dealers, supermarkets or restaurants.

<HEAD>RJR Headquarters May Wind Up A Blip In Atlanta's Business History</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Less than two years after its much-heralded move
to Atlanta, the corporate headquarters of RJR Nabisco Inc. may be
moving again, leaving little mark on the city's business history.
   RJR Nabisco's board of directors shocked their hometown,
Winston-Salem, N.C., in January 1987 by announcing the move of
corporate headquarters to metropolitan Atlanta.
   Wednesday, the food-and-tobacco giant's board officially picked
corporate takeover kings Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. as the
company's new owner. And Kohlberg Kravis has said it would like to
move RJR Nabisco's headquarters back to Winston-Salem.
   Such a move would not have the impact on Atlanta that losing one
of its other corporate giants _ such as Delta Air Lines or Coca-Cola
_ would have.
   RJR Nabisco only brought some 300 headquarters employees to
rented luxury office space in Cobb County, just north of the city.
   Most RJR Nabisco workers in the Atlanta area aren't even at the
headquarters. Among them are 750 at Nabisco's plant in Atlanta's
Oakland City community. There has been no indication that Nabisco's
manufacturing operations in the area would be affected immediately
by the Kohlberg Kravis takeover.
   Thus, Atlanta leaders took the idea of an RJR headquarters
pullout in stride.
   ``We certainly have appreciated having RJR's corporate
headquarters in the Atlanta area,'' Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young said
Thursday in a statement released by his office. ``Should they decide
to relocate, I remain confident that the high-employment facilities
in the Atlanta area will remain.''
   In its nearly two years here, RJR Nabisco has not become an
integral part of life in the city for most Atlantans outside the
big-business community. The company has no landmark presence, no
giant tower on the city skyline.
   ``It's been a corporate presence,'' said Barry King, vice
president for communications for the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce.
``In the Fortune 500...they're very high, and that's been important
for Atlanta to be perceived as a major headquarters city.
   ``But we still have the Nabisco presence here, and...in economic
impact, it would be minimal; there's only 300 employees in the
headquarters that's potentially moving.''
   RJR Nabisco picked Atlanta as its new home primarily because of
the business climate and the proximity to Hartsfield Atlanta
International Airport, one of the world's largest airports.
   King said those factors still might prompt RJR Nabisco to stay.
   ``It remains to be seen what the final decision would be,'' he
said. ``We think Atlanta has still got the same qualities that
attracted RJR to this city in the first place.''
   RJR Nabisco's spokeswoman in Atlanta, Polly Howes, said it was
too early for headquarters staffers to talk about where they might
be headed.

<HEAD>Pepsico Set To Buy General Cinema Bottling Operation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some analysts say Pepsico Inc.'s planned
acquisition of General Cinema Corp.'s soft drink bottling operation
will help increase efficiency in the business, putting downward
pressure on soda prices.
   Pepsico and General Cinema announced the proposed $1.5 billion
deal on Thursday.
   Analysts said the deal would bring General Cinema top dollar for
the bottling operation, relieving some of the earnings and cash flow
pressure the company has felt from a decline in its movie revenues
and heavy investment in retailing, confectionary and tobacco
companies.
   The move brings one of the nation's biggest independent bottlers
under Pepsi's control, allowing the soft drink giant to consolidate
bottling operations and reduce costs, industry analysts said.
   ``There are too many bottlers operating at inefficient levels. If
Pepsi can bring the production costs down, the competition in the
industry will drive the retail price down,'' said Roy D. Burry, a
senior vice president at the Wall Street brokerage house of Kidder,
Peabody Inc.
   The company, headquartered in the Boston suburb of Chestnut Hill,
owns and operates 1,359 movie screens at 318 locations throughout
the United States. Earnings from the movie operations declined about
5 percent despite a slight rise in box office revenues in the fiscal
year ended Oct. 31, Nardone said.
   General Cinema owns about 60 percent of the Neiman Marcus Group,
which consists of Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and Contempo
Casuals stores. It has announced plans to open 10 to 12 new Neiman
Marcus stores by 1995.
   General Cinema also has bought about 18 percent of the stock in
Cadbury-Schweppes PLC since 1986, said company spokesman Philip
Nardone.
   General Cinema entered the bottling business in 1968 by acquiring
American Beverage Corp., which held Pepsi franchises in Miami and
northern Ohio. It subsequently purchased other franchises and now
has regional bottling facilities in Atlanta; Jacksonville, Fla.;
Winston-Salem, N.C.; Twinsburg, Ohio; and Charleston, W.Va.
   General Cinema Beverages had preliminary revenue of about $720
million for the fiscal year ended Oct. 31 and expects operating
earnings of about $93 million, the company said.
   For the quarter ended June 30, the company reported net earnings
of about $36 million on revenue of about $631 million, more than
double the profit from the year before.
   Pepsico, headquartered in Purchase, N.Y., had earnings of $595
million on revenue of $11.5 billion in 1987. It projects revenue of
about $13 billion this year.
   Analysts said they expect the General Cinema purchase to dilute
Pepsico's earnings by about 15 cents a share in 1989.
   The companies said the transaction is subject to the signing of a
definitive agreement, clearance of antitrust laws and closing prior
to the end of 1988.

   The dollar was trading steadily against major
currencies in Europe today, with market players reluctant to be
active ahead of the release of U.S. unemployment figures.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   Foreign exchange dealers said they didn't expect much movement
ahead of the release of the U.S. unemployment figures for November.
Market forecasts anticipate the unemployment rate will be unchanged
from its October level of 5.3 percent.
   Non-farm payrolls, which are often seen as a more direct gauge
for economic activity, are expected to show a gain of 260,000.
   ``The market is only concentrated on the unemployment figures.
They may reopen a new chapter for the dollar,'' said one corporate
trader in Rome.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.8498 from $1.8535 late
Thursday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.07 Japanese yen to a closing 121.64
yen. Later, in London, it dropped slightly to 121.63 yen.
   Other mid-morning dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.7331 West German marks, up from
1.7300; 1.4525 Swiss francs, up from 1.4498; 5.9205 French francs,
up from 5.9075; 1.9552 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9510; 1,281.75
Italian lire, up from 1,278.00; 1.1880 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1855.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $423.35 a troy ounce, up
from Thursday's late bid price of $423.25. Later, London's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of $423.80.
   In Zurich, the metal fell to a bid of $423.15 from $424.90 bid
late Thursday.
   In Hong Kong, gold fell $1.07 a troy ounce to close at a bid
$424.45.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a bid price of $6.12 a troy
ounce from $6.15 bid late Thursday.

   The dollar remained unchanged against the Japanese
yen today, while share prices fell back slightly.
   The dollar closed at 121.64 yen, the same as its opening. The
currency, which started the day's trading 0.07 yen higher than
Thursday's close of 121.57, moved in a narrow range of 121.60-121.68
yen.
   ``It ranged in a narrow range throughout the day.... There were
few moves to take fresh dollar positions prior to the release of the
U.S. unemployment rate,'' said a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
   The U.S. Labor Department was scheduled to announce its latest
monthly jobless figures for November later today.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 37.44-point loser the previous day, shed 9.21
points, or 0.03 percent, to finish trading at 29,532.25. The index
gained 26.19 points during the morning session, but edged down in
the afternoon.
   ``Trading was very volatile as investors were moved by various
speculation'' over the U.S. jobless rate, said Masahiro Umemori of
Nomura Securities, Japan's largest brokerage.
   Volume on the market's first section was an estimated 1.2 billion
shares, compared to 1.5 billion shares posted the previous day.

<TEXT>
   Two trade groups are calling for sharply
different solutions to the savings and loan crisis, with one
advocating abolishing S&Ls as a separate industry and the other
making preservation of the current system a priority.
   The National Council of Savings Institutions, the smaller of the
two lobbying groups, wants to abolish the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp., which backs individual deposits of up to $100,000
in S&Ls.
   A proposal expected to be adopted by the council's board of
directors on Monday says healthy S&Ls should be permitted to
transfer to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which guarantees
deposits in commercial banks.
   S&Ls that can't qualify for transfer would have five years to
become healthy or shut down. In the end, only one federal insurance
fund would remain, regulating both commerical banks and savings
institutions. There would no longer be institutions devoted
exclusively to financing home mortgages.
   That's the opposite of recommendations released Thursday by the
largest trade group, the U.S. League of Savings Institutions. The
league wants to preserve the separate regulatory system for S&Ls and
housing finance.
   The varied approaches are explained in part by differences
between their memberships. About two-thirds of the council's members
are called savings banks and are already insured by the FDIC. Most
of the rest have a good chance of qualifying for transfer. However,
many of the league's members are not healthy enough to join the FDIC.
   Both groups agree that the industry can't pay the $50 billion to
$100 billion cost of cleaning up insolvent S&Ls and that Congress
and the administration must find a way to pay.
   The council said Congress must use tax money, but argued for
keeping S&L rescue spending exempt from Gramm-Rudman budget deficit
requirements. The league said it will offer its funding proposal
early next year.
   While the league is emphasizing the need to maintain a separate
lending system for housing, it also advised against a significant
rollback of rules permitting S&Ls in some states to invest in risky
ventures far removed from home mortage lending.
   Instead, it advocates controlling abuses by requiring S&L owners
to put up more of their own money, or capital, when entering risky
ventures.
   ``When people have their own capital at risk, they tend to act
more responsibly,'' said Gerald J. Levy, president of Guaranty
Savings & Loan Association in Milwaukee, who chaired the league task
force on the issue.
   Many analysts blame the industry's current problems in large part
on institutions that strayed into speculative areas such as lending
to commercial real estate projects, particularly in states with
permissive laws, such as Texas, California and Florida.
   The league said state-chartered S&Ls that used new investment
powers wisely ``should not be penalized for the sins of those who
have abused'' them.
   But Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the House Banking
Committee and frequent critic of S&Ls, warned, ``The days are over
when the federal government will provide insurance and then permit a
state regulator to allow those insured deposits to be put into
anything under the sun.
   ``Overall the U.S. League will get some sympathy in Congress when
they say we shouldn't tax the healthy thrifts into oblivion,''
Schumer said. ``But they're going to face far less sympathy when
they resist the reform measures that are going to have to accompany
taxpayer dollars.''
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates the nation's
3,000 federally insured S&Ls, proposed a risk-based capital
regulation on Monday that would be phased in by 1993.
   While not addressing that specific proposal, the league said
``provisions should be made where applicable for grandfathering,''
meaning that some institutions should be exempted from meeting the
new requirements.
   The league did advocate curbing the growth of insolvent
institutions, a measure already adopted by the bank board. It
recommended tightening rules governing creation of new institutions
and takeover of existing S&Ls.
   It also wants better standards for appraising the property that
secures loans. It said S&Ls should be required to independently
evaluate loans or parts of loans they purchase from other
institutions.

<TEXT>
   Walt Disney Co., the nation's top producer
of movies through its Touchstone Films and Disney Films, is forming
a third production division called Hollywood Pictures.
   Disney announced Thursday that the new company would start Feb. 1
and produce 12 movies annually within three years.
   Hollywood Pictures will make films similar to those from
Touchstone, which produces mainstream fare racier than Disney's
traditional animated features and kids' comedies, the company said.
   Disney films are distributed through a unit called Buena Vista,
which has the biggest share of the nation's box office this year,
according to the Hollywood trade paper Daily Variety.
   Up to Nov. 13, Buena Vista movies grabbed 20.5 percent of
domestic movie ticket sales, Variety reported.
   Disney is followed on that list by Paramount Studios at 14.1
percent and 20th Century Fox at 12.3 percent.
   Touchstone, formed in 1984, reaped a box office bonanza last year
with ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' and ``Three Men and a Baby.''

<HEAD>Deficit to `Intrude Heavily' on Farm Policy, Outgoing Ag Chief Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farm policymakers in the Bush administration
are going to find themselves sharply constrained by pressure to cut
the budget deficit, says outgoing Secretary of Agriculture Richard
E. Lyng.
   ``You cannot avoid having the problems of trade deficit and
fiscal deficit intrude heavily on agricultural policy in the new
administration,'' Lyng said Thursday at USDA's annual Agricultural
Outlook Conference.
   Lyng and two other panelists said as much as $3 billion may have
to be cut from farm programs in 1989 to meet targets under the
Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law.
   Farm programs of the government's Commodity Credit Corp.
currently cost about $13 billion a year, down from peak of $26
billion in fiscal 1986.
   The panelists suggested that Congress might pass an extension of
the farm law and postpone at least until 1991 any real overhaul of
the current five-year programs expiring in 1990.
   Lyng again said he will be leaving at the start of the new
administration. Numerous possible successors have been mentioned,
but thus far no word has come from President-elect Bush or his
transition team.
   Farm programs approved in 1985 under the pressure of a
large-scale rural crisis have proven highly popular, Lyng said.
   ``I don't think we would have any changes in farm programs if it
weren't for budget pressures,'' he said. But ``You've got $3 billion
to save in some shape or form and it's going to drive changes, I
think, in 1989.''
   Even so, there is no reason to think the Bush administration will
propose sweeping changes right away, said Lynn Daft, an agricultural
economist and former USDA official.
   ``You don't have to come forward with legislation right away,''
he said. He noted that farmers are not clamoring for any change. ``I
don't see any tractors across the street on the Mall,'' he said.
   ``If I were a new administration coming in, I'd say, why rush?''
he said.
   That only provides another reason for stopgap legislation, the
panelists said.
   ``Particularly when you've got eight members of the Senate
Agriculture Committee up for re-election'' in 1990, said William
Lesher, a consultant and former Lyng business partner also appearing
on the panel.
   ``My guess as the secretary says is that it's at least a 50
percent chance'' that stopgap legislation will be approved, he said.
   Lesher told the panel there are only three ways to reduce farm
program spending by $3 billion.
   He said one would be to lower target prices _ congressionally set
price levels used in calculating income-support payments. Another
would be to reduce the acreage base used in calculating payments, he
said, and a third would be to cut the amount of acreage planted.

   The Agriculture Department has unveiled a 1989
program for rice farmers with a national average price-support level
of $6.50 for each 100 pounds.
   The support level represents an expected reduction from a
national average of $6.63 in 1988.
   Price support loans are paid by the government's Commodity Credit
Corp. to farmers who post their crops as collateral. Because
producers are free to forfeit the crops and keep the cash, the
system puts a floor under prices.
   Among program requirements that farmers must meet to qualify for
federal subsidies, Secretary of Agriculture Richard E. Lyng
announced a required acreage reduction of 25 percent. This
represents land that farmers cannot plant and is designed to prevent
surpluses.
   Lyng set the established target price at $10.80 for each 100
pounds, down from $11.15 this year.
   Target prices are used in calculating so-called deficiency
payments that the government provides as income supports to
participants in some programs.
   Other provisions of the rice program:
   _Whole kernel milled rice price support rates were set at $10.81
per hundredweight for long grain and $9.81 for medium and short
grain rice. The broken kernel rate for all rice classes is $5.41.
   _Producers who pledged 1989 crop rice as collateral for price
support loans will not be permitted to purchase marketing
certificates when repaying loans at the marketing loan repayment
rate.
   _The discretionary inventory reduction program will not be
implemented.
   _Farmers may sign up for the program between Dec. 19 and April 14.

   Enrollments in colleges of agriculture at land
grant universities are up this year, reversing a decade-long
decline, the Agriculture Department says.
   ``This fall, undergraduate enrollments have taken a long awaited
upturn at many agricultural colleges,'' said a statement from J.
Patrick Jordan, administrator of USDA's cooperative state extension
service. ``At other schools, enrollments of agriculture majors have
begun to stabilize after years of fewer and fewer ag majors.''
   He said a USDA survey showed agriculture enrollment up 11 percent
in two years at Kansas State, 4 percent in the last year at Purdue,
16 percent at Penn State and 4 percent at Oregon State.
   Starting salaries for graduates also are on the rise, the
department said.
   It said campus placement officials reported starting salaries
ranging up to $30,000 for food science graduates. Purdue reported
salaries up to $30,000 for agricultural engineers, food science and
agricultural economics graduates.
   The average, however, was about $20,000 and those finding jobs in
urban areas tended to get more, the department said.

<DATELINE>RHODES, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 12 EEC leaders opened a two-day summit
Friday to review progress toward creating a borderless,
single-market Europe by 1992.
   Officials said the leaders would seek to reassure the United
States and Japan, the EEC's main trading partners, that their
efforts to boost trade within the European Economic Community will
not be at the expense of imports.
   A draft statement to that effect, says that a single EEC market
will benefit also ``non community countries. 1992 Europe will not
close in on itself...will not be a fortress Europe but a partnership
Europe.''
   About 12 hours before the summit began, four bombs exploded in
Athens about 200 miles away, police said. No one was injured in the
blasts that caused minor damage to buildings, including an EEC
office. The Revolutionary Popular Struggle said it set off the
bombs. The left-wing group has claimed responsibility for bomb
attacks in the past.
   The EEC leaders, accompanied by their foreign ministers, began
their meeting with a luncheon hosted by Greek Premier Andreas
Papandreou, the summit's host.
   On Friday morning, the leaders held bilateral meetings. Britsh
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher met with West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and, officials said, they agreed it would be useful to
have a summit meeting of the leaders of the 16 NATO nations in
London in either May or June.
   The EEC summit is held at the Knights' palace, a 14th century
castle that is part of a medieval citadel overlooking the entrance
to a small harbor that the colossus of Rhodes was once said to have
straddled.
   The Greeks spent nearly $5 million renovating the massive
205-room castle which Italian dictator Benito Mussolini once planned
to use as his summer residence.
   The Greek premier arrived Thursday leading a 150-member
delegation.
   ``I feel optimistic about the summit. I think we can reach
significant decisions that will be good for the Community and good
for Greece,'' Papandreou said.
   The comment was apparently designed to remove fears Thatcher will
press her case that the EEC`s single-market project must not lead to
the creation of a central bank and a single currency.
   Britain's EEC partners, however, feel that is the road the
Community must take.
   Officials said the European leaders will have wide-ranging
political discussions.
   They are expected to discuss, among other things, the Middle East
and to issue a statement on East-West relations and the EEC's role
in world affairs.

<HEAD>Maxwell Launches Test Issue Of European Newspaper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RHODES, GREECE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British media magnate Robert Maxwell on
Friday launched a 12-page test issue of ``The European,'' his daily
newspaper.
   Maxwell promised the newspaper would promote European unity and
would in particular take aim at the ``old-fashioned, nationalistic''
views of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Maxwell said the newspaper would begin daily sales on May 9,
1989, with the eventual goal of achieving circulation of at least
500,000 copies a day and probably between 600,000 and 650,000 copies.
   Speaking at a press conference held to coincide with the summit
of European Economic Community leaders on the Greek island of
Rhodes, Maxwell said that his initial investment in the project
would total between 20 million and 30 million pounds, the equivalent
of $37 million to $55.5 million, with an additional 10 million
pounds, or $18.5 million, for promoting the launch of the newspaper.
   Maxwell added that he was committing himself to investing in the
newspaper for ``three to five years.''
   Maxwell said that ``The European'' would sell at newstands for 40
British pence (80 cents) and on the Continent for the equivalent of
5 French francs.
   Maxwell said that the newspaper's editorial position would
champion European unity and actively oppose anyone who ``slows down
progress'' toward such unity.
   ``We will support anything and anybody in favor of European
unity,'' he said, taking particular aim at Thatcher.
   Maxwell criticized the British premier for opposing greater
European unity in several areas, and singled out her opposition to
British entry into the European monetary system as an ``idiotic
position'' for which he claimed the U.K. is paying a ``devastating
price'' in terms of high interest and exchange rates.
   ``She will fail in making Britain again miss the European bus,''
Maxwell said.
   Maxwell said he also was in favor in principle of entry by other
countries into the EEC, a more powerful European Parliament and the
reunification of Germany.
   Maxwell said he foresees a staff of 200 to 250 journalists at
``The European'' with editorial centers in London, Paris, Brussels
and Munich. The paper will be published in every country in which
circulation exceeds 30,000 copies.
   Maxwell said that in recent conversations with the EEC he had
informed European Commission officials that he opposed investors
``such as myself'' having a ``stranglehold'' on several media in a
single geographical market. Maxwell said that he supported
regulations limiting such power.
   Maxwell Communication Corp. PLC last month acquired the New York
publishing company Macmillan Inc. for $2.5 billion.
   Maxwell's promotional test issue was a 12-page full-sized daily
with news items and features from across Europe, illustrated with
both black-and-white and color photographs. The issue's editorial
reflected Maxwell's opposition to Mrs. Thatcher's view of European
integration.
   The editorial said that Mrs. Thatcher's opposition to monetary
union in the EEC has ``blighted hopes that progress towards the
unity of Europe was accelerating.''
   The commentary piece added: ``Having haggled and hectored for
years to reduce the cost of Britain's entry into Europe, she has now
deliberatly created a new hostility to the whole concept, which
alarms and depresses Britain's friends.''
   Maxwell's newspaper carries its name in big bold letters across
the top of the entire front page and below it, in smaller letters,
is written ``Forward with Europe''.

<TEXT>
   A nationwide mailing next week of 500,000 booklets
to some autoworkers is the latest step in a joint AIDS education
program run by General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers
union.
   ``Our main message is that you can't get AIDS through casual
contact in the workplace,'' said Maureen Moll, a consultant to the
program. ``There's a lot of fear out there, and we're trying to
educate people on how AIDS is transmitted and on what they have to
do to protect themselves.''
   The 36-page color, magazine-size booklet is to be mailed
beginning Monday.
   It contains articles about helping a relative deal with the
disease, how to tell children about acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, understanding the disease in the workplace, research and
financial help for victims and their families.
   Trish Houtteman, co-coordinator of the UAW-GM AIDS Education
Program which developed the booklet, said GM employees and their
families account for about 2.3 million people, or about 1 percent of
the U.S. population.
   Houtteman said because of confidentiality rules, she doesn't know
how many GM employees have AIDS. The Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta said this week it has received reports of 79,389 AIDS cases
nationwide, resulting in 44,950 deaths.
   If federal projections about the growth of AIDS are correct and 1
percent of those people are GM employees, Houtteman said, the
automaker could be faced with insuring 2,500 AIDS victims by 1991.
   The cost of that could run into billions of dollars, said Ted
Miller, the program's other co-coordinator.
   ``This wasn't done just because of economics, I can assure you,''
said Miller, assistant director of the UAW's GM Department. ``It's
more a question of helping people.''
   The booklet also contains frequently asked questions and answers
about AIDS, a fatal disease that disables the body's ability to
fight infections.
   The booklet is part of a larger program that also has included a
conference by video in February among about 2,000 company and union
officials, a nationwide mailing of a six-page booklet earlier this
year and training for medical and safety personnel and counselors at
all GM plants.

   Involved in the recall are about 38,000 of the toy trains with
metal plug connectors between the tender car and the locomotive
section. They were manufactured in Hong Kong in 1986 and were
identified as Model 1170.
   Newer train sets carrying that model number, but having a plastic
plug connector between the two cars, are not involved in the recall,
the commission said.
   Owners of the recalled train sets can obtain a free replacement
by calling New Bright Industries at 1-800-325-5630. Michigan
residents should call collect at 1-313-981-0020. Consumers can also
write to New Bright Industries, 41911 Ford Road, Canton, Mich.,

   Interest rates jumped and stocks slipped today in reaction to a
government report that the economy created 463,000 jobs in November
and a record percentage of the American population was at work.
   The signs of economic growth were regarded as more significant
than a slight uptick in the civilian unemployment rate, which rose
to 5.4 percent from a 14-year low of 5.3 percent in October.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
dipped 8.53 points to 2,093.35 after half an hour of trading.
   The dollar was little changed in active trading. Ordinarily the
dollar would rise in response to evidence of strong economic growth,
but there was little buying interest.
   ``The market has totally and unequivocally ignored whatever
positive news for the dollar there has been,'' said John McCarthy,
chief currency dealer for Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank in New York.
   The 0.1 percentage point increase from October's jobless rate was
due almost entirely to a 560,000 increase in the civilian labor
force _ the number of people either holding jobs or looking for
them, the Labor Department said.
   The labor force had remained essentially unchanged from August
through October and has grown by only 2 million people in the past
12 months, including the big gain in November, reflecting a tapering
off of the Baby Boom generation entering the job market.
   Despite the slight increase in the unemployment rate, the
government figures showed 116 million Americans holding jobs last
month, or 62.6 percent of the adult population age 16 or over. Both
are record highs, said Labor Statistics Commissioner Janet L.
Norwood.
   Strong employment gains raise fears that the economy will
overheat and prices will rise. That hurts the value of fixed-income
securities.
   The price of the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 1 3-16
point, or $11.88 per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which rises when
the price falls, climbed to 9.13 percent from 9.02 percent late
Thursday.
   There were rumors that the Federal Reserve would raise its
discount rate to cool off the economy. Such a move would push up
short-term interest rates in general, making the dollar more
attractive to the world's investors.
   But the dollar was flat to slightly lower in hectic trading
today, at about 121.3 Japanese yen and 1.73 West German marks.
   On Thursday, the Commerce Department said its main economic
barometer indicated a possible slowing of the economy's expansion
during October. It said its Index of Leading Indicators edged up 0.1
percent after falling the previous month.
   Analysts cautioned against drawing any firm conclusions until the
index, used to forecast the economy's direction, established a
consistent pattern.
   The index has declined in five of the past 12 months. It dropped
a revised 0.3 percent in September, compared with the previous
estimate of minus 0.1 percent. It also fell in July and May, but
rose in June and August.
   When the economy is slowing, the Federal Reserve Board is less
likely to move interest rates higher.
   The financial markets all but disregarded the leading indicators
report, awaiting instead today's release of the November
unemployment figures. Activity on all markets was light as many
investors stayed on the sidelines.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, up
nearly 40 points over the past three sessions, fell 12.63 to close
at 2,101.88.
   The dollar was little changed in foreign exchange trading.
   The bond market reacted positively to the leading indicators,
with the Treasury's key 30-year issue rising about $5 for every
$1,000 in face amount. In a separate report Thursday, the Commerce
Department said construction activity rose 0.9 percent in October to
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $409.2 billion, the fourth
consecutive monthly increase.
   Strength was in most categories, but half the gain came in
single-family homes, the department said.
   In other economic news, the nation's largest general retailers
reported their sales continued at a sluggish pace in November, but
an end-of-the-month surge was a positive sign for the Christmas
shopping season.

   Super Valu Stores Inc. has reached an
agreement in principle with Red Owl Stores Inc. to buy the assets of
Red Owl's warehouse and distribution operations, its commercial
bakery plant and candy and tobacco company, the companies said
Friday.
   Terms of the sale were not disclosed.
   Super Valu, based in Eden Prairie, will buy Red Owl's warehouse
and distribution facilities in Minneapolis, Fargo, N.D., and Green
Bay, Wis., as well as the bakery plant and Jude Candy & Tobacco Co.
in Plymouth.
   Red Owl, based in Minneapolis, will continue to own and operate
the 30 corporate Red Owl retail food stores.
   The agreement is subject to approval by the Federal Trade
Commission and completion of a definitive contract.
   Super Valu said the purchase, when completed, would secure
additional distribution capacity to serve the growing business of
its independent retailers, as well as Red Owl retailers in the six
state Upper Midwest region.
   Super Valu, a food wholesaler, services over 2,800 foods stores,
virtually all of which are independently owned, in 34 states.
   C. Patrick Schulke, president and chief operating officer of Red
Owl, said Red Owl management elected to close its warehouse
operations and have its independent retailers served by Super Valu.
   Schulke and the other owners of Red Owl will concentrate on the
operation of the company's corporate retail stores, which will be
supplied by Super Valu upon completion of the transaction.
   Super Valu said that on approval of the agreement it will take
necessary steps to provide uninterrupted service to independent
retailers previously supplied by Red Owl.
   Super Valu also said that plans call for the Red Owl distribution
centers in Fargo and Green Bay to operate as storage facilities for
their existing distribution centers and that Red Owl's 300,000
square-foot Hopkins warehouse would be expanded and remodeled ``in
the near future to roughly double in size.''
   Managements of both companies met with employees Friday to
announce the agreement.

<HEAD>Looking for a Few Good Retailing Stocks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Choosing a retailing stock these days is about as
easy as finding the right Christmas gift for your hard-to-please
uncle.
   There may be a wide selection to choose from, but it takes a lot
of looking before you can settle on the right one.
   With a sales slump that has dragged on for nearly two years, the
retailing sector has not been at the top of many investors' ``buy''
lists.
   The investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., for example,
recommended last month that investors purchase just two out of 40
U.S. retailing companies.
   And as Stacy Ruchlamer, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc., said in an evaluation of the retailing sector in late
November, ``selectivity is paramount.'' She recommended six out of
19 stocks.
   Retailing stocks fell out of favor well before the Oct. 19 market
crash last year. Stagnant sales and stores' declining profits cast a
pall on the entire sector, and when investors learned that fall 1987
fashion lines had flopped, they began dumping retailing issues.
   Things got so antsy that last November, when Wal-Mart Stores
Inc.'s sales were running about 8 percent ahead of year-earlier
levels _ compared with the company's usual 13 percent _ several
analysts slapped a ``sell'' recommendation on the discount retailer.
And Wal-Mart was, and has been, a consistent star of the retailing
industry, thriving when its competitors were stumbling.
   But some of the casualties are making a comeback.
   One of the most prominent examples is Gap Inc. The specialty
apparel retailer's stock, which had peaked at nearly $78 a share in
August 1987, had plunged to just under $37 by a month later. In two
days alone, it fell nearly $19.
   Now, Gap is showing up on ``buy'' lists.
   Goldman Sachs & Co. analyst Joseph Ellis, in an analysis of Gap
late last month, said the retailer ``is restoring its merchandising,
financial and management credibility as a growth retailer.''
   Ellis cited the company's new styles, which are generating
improved sales, and its cost controls, among the reasons for his
``buy'' recommendation.
   According to the analysis, Gap has conquered some of the problems
that plagued the retail sector last year by offering a wide
selection of merchandise that is distinctive from the fashions
offered by other retailers. One of the biggest complaints women had
last year's was they saw the same styles in store after store.
   Gap's success is evidence of how retailers can, on an individual
basis, reclaim their lost glory. But overall, the sector remains
under a pall as long as consumers spend more money on necessities
and services and less at shopping malls.
   With this gloomy reality, analysts and retailers alike are
casting a very cautious eye on the Christmas shopping season. This
is make-it-or-break-it time: Retailers earn about half their annual
profits during the holidays.
   Although overall sales continued sluggish in November, analysts
said a post-Thanksgiving pickup indicated the stores might have a
moderately good season. No one, however, is predicting it will be
great.
   The retailers generally have cut their costs and reduced
inventory in recent months to preserve their profits. But as long as
booming sales are a thing of the past, a winning retail stock could
remain hard to find.

   Bendix-King has signed an agreement
to provide federally required collision avoidance radar systems for
American Airlines.
   The multi-year agreement announced Thursday by the companies is
valued at $100 million. It calls for Bendix-King to provide the
systems for 600 planes.
   Fort Worth-based American plans to spend an estimated $140
million for the equipment, including installation, according to
American spokesman Jim Brown.
   Installation is expected to start late next year and be completed
by the end of 1991 to meet a federal deadline for adding the
systems, Brown said.
   The Bendix-King system lets commercial and corporate aircraft
communicate automatically with each other, pinpointing location,
altitude and direction.
   When another plane comes within five miles, the system's monitor
will highlight its position, direction, altitude and ascent or
descent. If the system determines that the plane is on a collision
course, it will instruct the pilot _ both by synthesized voice and
an on-screen graphic _ to descend, climb or hold present course.

   Futures prices of grain and soybeans opened
slightly lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade in a continuation
of the sell-off that ended Thursday's trading session.
   Analysts said the early decline did not appear to be linked to
any bearish new supply-and-demand developments.
   In fact, reports of new shipments of South American soybean meal
bound for the Soviet Union should have been a positive factor for
the soybean market, said Ted Mao, grain specialist with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   ``Things are starting to steady up a bit,'' Mao said about 20
minutes after the opening. ``It might be that we just ran through a

<HEAD>Public Offering Substantially Over-Subscribed, Firm Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The offering of shares in state-owned British Steel
PLC to private British investors was ``substantially
over-subscribed,'' the investment firm organizing the sale said
Friday.
   Applications were still being counted, but investors applied for
far more than the 452 million British Steel shares on offer to the
general public, said Gillian Oakes of the British investment firm
Samuel Montagu and Co.
   The deadline for applications was Friday morning and trading in
the shares is to begin Monday.
   British Steel shares are priced at 125 pence, or $2.31 each,
valuing the entire company at 2.5 billion pounds, or the equivalent
of $4.6 billion.
   Private investors apparently were undeterred by the recent drop
in prices on the British stock market, which has been unsettled by
another rise in British interest rates and the recent strength of
the pound. The investors seem to have looked instead at British
Steel's operating strengths and the high yield on the shares, Oakes
said.
   Investors also apparently were not frightened off by the failure
of the government's last privatization, the sale of its one-third
stake in British Petroleum Co. PLC last fall, which flopped with
investors because it coincided with the stock markets' crash.
   Privatization is the process by which a state-owned company is
turned over to public ownership.
   The shares offered to private investors represent around 23
percent of the total 2 billion British Steel shares which the
British government is selling. The balance has been underwritten by
British and overseas institutions.
   If private investors apply for more than 762 million shares, the
bank will trigger a ``clawback'' mechanism, reducing the number of
shares offered to overseas institutions from 33 percent to 25
percent of the total. And if applications exceed 980 million shares,
British institutions will see their part in the issue reduced from
44 percent to 33 percent.

   RJR Nabisco Inc.'s prospective new owner says
there are no plans to radically dissect the food-and-cigarette giant

billion, but securities analysts disagree.

Neal Kaplan, who follows RJR for Interstate-Johnson Lane Securities
in Charlotte, N.C. said Thursday in assessing the aftermath of the
biggest takeover deal in history.
   ``I can't conceive of them keeping it intact.''
   After an exhaustive auction overseen by a special RJR directors
committee, buyout specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. triumphed
late Wednesday over an RJR management group led by chief executive
F. Ross Johnson.
   The directors accepted Kohlberg's package of cash and securities
valued at $109 a share for each of RJR's 225 million shares for a
total of $24.53 billion, and rejected an offer from Johnson's group
valued at $112 a share or $25.2 billion.
   They said both offers were nearly the same but Kohlberg's offer
would give shareholders a 25 percent stake in the acquired company,
compared with a 15 percent stake offered by Johnson.
   Both offers would rely heavily on borrowed money to be repaid
through RJR's earnings, assets or both, a transaction commonly
called a leveraged buyout. It was widely expected that Kohlberg
would sell many if not all of RJR's food businesses and leave its
highly profitable tobacco business intact.
   But Kohlberg principal Henry Kravis told a few selected financial
journalists in New York he foresaw no urgent reason to sell any of
RJR's operations, people familiar with his remarks said.
   ``There will be no wholesale dismemberment of the company, no
immediate fire sale, and that is still the case,'' although
``obviously some businesses will have to be sold,'' the sources
paraphrased Kravis as saying.
   No decisions have been made yet on what to shed, Kravis was
quoted as saying. He also was said to have described the leveraged
buyout as one of the most conservative his firm had ever done
despite the enormous price.
   Disclosing more details of how the takeover will be financed,
Kohlberg said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission today that four banks will lend $2.7 billion and assemble
a syndicate of other banks to lend another $14 billion.
   In addition, the SEC filing showed, Kohlberg's two main Wall
Street financial backers, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Merrill
Lynch & Co., will lend $5 billion to be financed by high-yield
``junk bonds,'' and Kohlberg's own pool of investors will provide
the rest of the money.
   Kohlberg is the undisputed leader in leveraged buyouts, which
often leave acquired companies with staggering debt levels.
   For example, Kohlberg's 1986 leveraged buyout of supermarket
giant Safeway Stores Inc. for $4.2 billion left the acquired company
with a debt-to-equity ratio of 10-to-1.
   The RJR acquisition will more than quadruple the company's
existing debt of $5 billion to $22.3 billion. But the amount of
equity in the acquired company is estimated at about $7.4 billion,
for a debt-to-equity ratio of 3-to-1. In leveraged buyouts, that is
considered low.
   Although Kravis said he considered the fight for RJR over,
Johnson and his chief financial backer, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,
hinted Thursday that they were not finished.
   Johnson said in a statement he had spoken with Kravis and assured
him ``that if the board's action results in Kohlberg Kravis Roberts
owning the company, I will work with him toward a professional and
smooth transition.''
   But the statement also said Johnson and his investment-banking
allies ``are evaluating their options.''
   Some analysts speculated that Johnson, considered a daring
corporate boss, might take the unprecedented step of sidestepping
the board of the company he still heads and making an offer directly
to stockholders.
   RJR's stock price rose about 66 percent during the 5-week
takeover saga, partly on the prospect that ever-higher offers would
emerge. But the stock fell $1.25 Thursday to $91.75 in heavy
trading, evidently reflecting the view that Kohlberg's package of
$81 in cash and $28 in securities was worth less than its face
amount. The stock retreated another 75 cents this morning to $91.
   The RJR takeover battle focused nationwide attention on the
growing leveraged buyout trend and the enormous debt burdens many
companies are acquiring in such transactions. Some economists fear
these heavily indebted companies could face unprecedented pressure
in a downturn.
   Underscoring that concern, Moody's Investors Service lowered the
credit rating on RJR's corporate bonds Thursday, saying it was
worried about the ability of the company to generate enough money to
service its increased debt.
   At the same time, Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., a large RJR
bondholder that sued the company last month when the value of its
bonds sank amid the takeover fight, said Kohlberg's name might be
added as a defendant.

   Cincinnati Milacron Inc. announced Friday it
plans to sell its semiconductor materials subsidiary to a Japanese
company which manufactures components for the semiconductor industry.
   Cincinnati Milacron, a Cincinnati-based manufacturer, declined to
disclose the price that Osaka Titanium Co. Ltd. will pay for the
subsidiary, Cincinnati Milacron Semiconductor Materials Inc.
   Milacron officials said they understand that Osaka Titanium plans
to continue manufacturing of semiconductor materials at Milacron's
plant in the southwestern Ohio town of Maineville. Milacron
officials said in February that they were seeking a buyer for the
semiconductor subsidiary.
   Cincinnati Milacron said another Japanese company, Sumitomo Metal
Industries Ltd., will hold an indirect minority interest in the
acquiring company.
   Osaka Titanium produces titanium sponge and silicon wafers for
the semiconductor industry. Sumitomo Metal Industries produces iron
and steel.
   Cincinnati Milacron had sales of $828 million in 1987. The
company's products also include industrial robots, plastics
machinery and machine tools.

<HEAD>Civilian Unemployment Edged Up in November to 5.4 Percent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The nation's civilian unemployment rate in
November edged upward from a 14-year low to 5.4 percent despite an
increase of 463,000 new jobs and a record percentage of the American
population at work, the government said today.
   The 0.1 percentage point increase from October's jobless rate of
5.3 percent was due almost entirely to a 560,000 increase in the
civilian labor force _ the number of people either holding jobs or
looking for them, the Labor Department said.
   The labor force had remained essentially unchanged from August
through October and has grown by only 2 million people in the past
12 months, including the big gain in November, reflecting a tapering
off of the Baby Boom generation entering the job market.
   Despite the slight increase in the unemployment rate, the
government figures showed 116 million Americans holding jobs last
month, or 62.6 percent of the adult population age 16 or over. Both
are record highs, said Labor Statistics Commissioner Janet L.
Norwood.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater attributed the
rise to ``a large increase in the labor force'' and noted that the
total number of employed reached an all-time high. ``There were more
people looking for work,'' he said.
   The number of factory jobs climbed by 71,000 in November on top
of a four-year record-high 99,000 new assembly line workers in
October following a slight decline in the late summer.
   ``Over the past year, the number of factory jobs has risen by
425,000,'' Norwood said in prepared testimony before the Joint
Economic Committee of Congress. `This growth has been concentrated
in a limited number of industries, with machinery alone counting for
more than a quarter of the gain.''
   Meanwhile, factory workers continued to average four hours of
overtime a week last month, indicating that the manufacturing sector
is continuning to boom and there is no slowdown in the rate of
economic growth.
   Many economists are concerned that inflation will continue
increasing unless the growth rate is slowed, but there was no
indication that it did in November, acording to the job figures, the
first economic indicator of the month.
   Construction employment increased by 55,000 over the month,
reflecting an upturn in housing starts, after sluggish activity from
July through October.
   The November job figures officially mark the sixth birthday of
the current economic expansion, the longest in the nation's history.
But the pattern of growth has not been consistent throughout.
   Factory jobs, for example, rose by 1.4 million in the first two
years of recovery following a loss of nearly 2 million jobs in the
1981-82 recession. But in 1985 and 1986, they declined by 600,000
before rebounding by 850,000 over the past two years.
   `Not unexpectedly, changes in the unemployment rate for adult men
have tracked closely with the factory job swings,'' said Norwood.
`It fell from 10 percent to 6.2 percent during the initial rebound,
was unchanged in the middle years, and dropped from 6.2 percent to
4.8 percent in the past two years.''
   The pattern of female joblessness, meanwhile, has shown a more
consistent, gradual decline. It, too, was 4.8 percent last month.
   The service side of the economy added 345,000 new jobs last
month, including 40,000 in transportation, reflecting an improvement
in the health of the airline industry.
   Retail trade employment climbed by 19,000 despite a decrease of
2,000 workers in department stores. Department store employment has
now been falling for five months in a row, an indication to some
economists that consumer spending is slowing and that exports of
U.S. manufactred products abroad are propelling the nation's
continued growth.
   Health service jobs rose by 56,000 last month while employment in
business services such as data processing climbed by 31,000 after
several months of sluggish activity.
   Meanwhile, average hourly earnings were unchanged at $9.45 in
November after rising by a nickel in October, setting off fears of a
wage-push inflation then.
   An alternate employment rate that includes the 1.7 million
members of the Armed Forces stationed in the country also rose last
month, from 5.2 percent to 5.3 percent.
   Unemployment rates for various population groups showed little or
no improvement. They climbed from 11 percent to 11.2 percent for
blacks, from 7.7 percent to 8.1 percent for Hispanics and from 26.5
percent to 30.4 percent for black teen-agers.

   In their latest and most likely final offer, the
management of RJR Nabisco Inc. offered shareholders $8 billion more
for their shares than in their first offer.
   What is $8 billion?
   Among other things, it is the asset value of a company the size
of Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co., including about 180 plants
and 370 sales offices and distribution centers in 49 countries.
   Or it is the assets of Georgia-Pacific Corp., which owns or has
cutting rights to 5.6 million acres of North American timberlands _
plus Morton Thiokol Inc., the aerospace contractor, and a few
hundred million dollars in change.
   Had shareholders accepted the first offer, which was publicized
as being in their interest, they would have, so to speak, left that
much on the table.
   It is because of such mind-boggling considerations as these that
aspects of the RJR Nabisco sale will be debated well into the next
century, and perhaps as long as business schools exist.
   Did shareholders get a fair deal? It would seem so, since the
stock leaped in a few weeks from $55 a share to more than $90. But
even after such good fortune, some shareholders might not be as
happy as you might think.
   A good many RJR Nabisco shareholders were long-term investors
with an eye on the steady dividends of 5 percent or so a year, which
they had expected to continue well into the future.
   These investors were not traders or sellers. RJR Nabisco was, to
them, a source of income. Suddenly, they have capital gains taxes to
pay which, when combined with state taxes, could approach 40 percent.
   What does the precipitous sale of an established company mean to
holders of bonds? Big losses. Bonds purchased when the company's
debt position was strong have, inevitably, lost value as the company
becomes burdened with debt.
   The questions drive at the very meaning of a company.
   Is a corporation a dynamic, ever-changing institution whose value
_ to its immediate owners or to society at large _ lies in its
unique ability to produce products and services?
   Or is it to be viewed as a static entity, like a consumer product
on a shelf, to be sold, and in the selling lose all its future value
as a creator of change, a payer of dividends, an employer, a
taxpayer, a producer?
   How is the RJR Nabisco management to be viewed, or in fact the
management of any company that promises to serve the shareholders,
creditors, employees and customers, but which plots to take the
company for its own portfolio?
   The meaning of ``insider trading,'' a term used commonly to
describe those outsiders who gain access to inside information and
use it for their own financial gain, might have to be reconsidered.
   Consider that prior to making their announcements, buyout
managements use privileged information to construct their offer.
They allow investors to buy bonds, knowing that those bonds will
fall in value on their announcement.
   Is it proper for management to arrange for the continuance of
their salaries, plus benefits, bonuses and lucrative pensions should
they fail in their takeover attempt and instead fall prey to a
hostile offer?
   Is an insider takeover and dismantling a proper end for a
thriving company built on the savings, sacrifices and ingenuity of
entrepreneurs, the millions of man-hours of labor, the years of
risks, the hard times conquered?
   In comparison, what sacrifices, ingenuity, labor, risks and hard
times are incurred by a management that benefits from its failure,
i.e. that puts the company on the block because it thinks it might
be better dead than alive?
   The debate is only beginning.

<HEAD>Arbitrators Say IBM-Fujitsu Deal Fair And Balanced</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The recent ruling ordering a Japanese computer
company to pay International Business Machines Corp. for use of the
software information running its computers was fair and should
satisfy concerns over protecting intellectual property rights,
American arbitrators said Friday.
   In a landmark case, two arbitrators assigned by the American
Arbitration Association Tuesday ordered Japan's largest computer
firm, Fujitsu Ltd., to pay IBM $237 million and tens of millions of
dollars each year beginning in 1989 under a complex payout plan for
special access to IBM's mainframe computer software.
   Including past payments, Fujitsu could pay IBM more than $1
billion by the end of the century.
   The decision followed years of wrangling between the world's
biggest computer company and its main Japanese rival over what IBM
claimed was Fujitsu's infringement on its intellectual property
rights.
   Fujitsu competes with IBM in the mainframe computer business with
a line of machines and accompanying base-layer software that are
supposed to be able to run the same programs as the IBM mainframes.
   Exploiting often murky copyright laws, Japan has been accused in
the past of altering imported technology to suit its own
requirements. The ruling by the arbitration association is expected
to make Japanese industry more cautious.
   ``The days when ideas were free are now over,'' said an editorial
Thursday in the Asahi Evening News.
   ``By tradition, Japanese industry has relied on Western
technologies for growth, freely `borrowing' them and adapting them
cleverly to its own needs.''
   ``But this won't be acceptable in the future,'' the editorial
said. ``The AAA ruling on the IBM-Fujitsu dispute will lend impetus
to the mounting global trend toward demanding monetary payment for
intellectual property.''
   Mnookin, a law professor at Stanford Law School, said IBM had
invested billions of dollars in its operating systems software.
While ``the precise scope of copyright protection is not entirely
clear, what is clear is that this investment in its property is
worthy of ... protection,'' he said.
   He said the ruling was ``fair and balanced'' and one in which
both parties were made substantially better off.
   ``Any concerns that customers may have had because of
uncertainties about intellectual property rights with respect to
compatible operating system software have now been put to rest,''
Jones said.

<HEAD>About 2,200 Chrysler workers to continue to receive pay after
production ends</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 2,200 of the most senior Chrysler
Corp. workers in Kenosha will continue to receive full pay and
benefits after the Dec. 23 end of production in the city until a
company-funded, $20 million job bank is depleted, a union official
says.
   United Auto Workers Local 72 Shop Committee Chairman Rudy Kuzel
said Thursday the job bank was provided in the plant closing
agreement negotiated with Chrysler.
   Kuzel estimated it will take the 2,200 employees about eight to
nine weeks, or until about March, to deplete the $20 million.
   After the money is gone, the workers can turn to state-sponsored
unemployment compensation benefits and company-funded Supplemental
Unemployment Benefits.
   The job bank was formed as compensation for the transfer of
L-body Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon model production from Kenosha
to Chrysler's Jefferson Avenue plant in Detroit.
   ``But the job bank is not just for those working on L-body,''
Kuzel said.
   The contract said the 2,200 most senior employees could be
transferred to non-traditional work once the L-body line is moved.
But Kuzel said he doubts enough work will remain in Kenosha for all
of them to actually be on the job.
   Regardless of whether they are working or not, they will earn
full pay and benefits, he said.
   The Wisconsin Job Service has said that most Chrysler Corp.
employees losing their jobs as a result of the plant closing will be
eligible for $200 weekly unemployment benefits for 26 weeks. The
union workers are to also receive SUB benefits of $100 per week for
24 weeks.
   Chrysler has said the ending of auto production in Kenosha will
put about 5,300 people out of work. About 1,200 people are to
continue working at the automaker's engine operation in Kenosha.

<HEAD>Mack Trucks Announces New Truck Line</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mack Trucks Inc. has unveiled a new truck
with a larger cab and sleeping space that is aimed at the market of
owner-operators.
   Mack Chairman John C. Curcio showed off the new truck Thursday
predicting it would boost company profit and revenue.
   If so, Mack would have consecutive profitable years for the first
time since 1978-79, according to Curcio.
   Curcio, speaking at Mack headquarters here, said the CH600 truck
would be produced at Mack's new factory in Winnsboro, S.C. The new
factory replaced an aging plant in Allentown.
   ``What you are seeing today is the first truly all-new truck of
the 1990s,'' the chairman said.
   He said the truck represented a five-year commitment by Mack, $60
million in design and development, plus millions of miles in testing.
   ``We see the results of shortcutting this process far too often
in today's super-competitive truck industry,'' Curcio said. ``We
resisted the temptation to rush to the market with a rehashed
version of the same old thing, or to rush a less-than-fully
developed and tested vehicle to market, as some other manufacturers
have done.''
   The innovations are expected to increase Mack's market share by 2
to 3 percentage points by 1991 from its current share of about 15
percent, said Paul Ritter, senior vice president of sales for the
company.
   After operating in red ink from 1982 through 1986, Mack Trucks
earned $4.09 million in 1987. The company has said it expects to
move further into the black this year.
   Through the first nine months of 1988, Mack reported earnings of
$18 million on sales of $1.6 billion, compared to a $15 million
profit on sales of $1.4 billion during the same period in 1987.
   The truck includes a new frame and chassis, and aerodynamic
efficiency was a key consideration in its design, Curcio said. Among
aspects designed to smooth air flow around the truck are a two-piece
windshield sloped 20 degrees and rounded and contoured lamps, the
company said.
   The CH600 will be no more expensive than Mack's former
conventional ``R'' truck _ averaging about $60,000.
   The CH600 _ and the E-7 engine to be introduced for the truck in
July or August _ are part of Mack's $500 million capital expenditure
program begun by Curcio in 1983.
   Part of Curcio's program was the replacement of the company's
antiquated 5C assembly plant in Allentown with one of the industry's
most modern assembly plants. Production of the new truck is to begin
Jan. 1.
   Last year, Mack introduced its CM400, its down-sized ``Baby 8''
intercity vehicle, and began producing it in its Macungie assembly
plant. The company also is spending $100 million to modernize its
power-train division in Hagerstown, Md., for production of the new
E-7 engine.

   Prices declined but then bounced back from their
lows on Wall Street today after the Labor Department released
better-than-expected employment figures for November.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was down 6.93 to
2,094.95 as of 2 p.m. EST. In earlier trading, the average was down
about 17 points.
   Declining issues were ahead of advancers by a margin of about
8-to-5, with 825 issues falling, 505 rising and 547 unchanged in New
York Stock Exchange trading.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed stocks was down 0.35
to 153.02 On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index
slipped 0.35 to 294.90.
   Volume on the Big Board came to a light 87.71 million shares with
two hours of trading left.
   The Labor Department's eagerly awaited report on November
employment disappointed traders because of an increase of 463,000
new jobs _ an indication that the economy remains robust.
   Bond prices tumbled on the news and stock prices followed suit
because of the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would move
interest rates higher to cool the economy down and keep a lid on
inflation.
   ``With employment soaring and capacity so full, the Fed's going
to have to lean against the economy and raise the discount rate,''
said Larry Wachtel, a market analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   But stocks recouped some of their losses in afternoon trading.
   Michael Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co., said ``A lot of
investors are looking for an entry into the market.''
   He said some traders believed Wall Street's reaction to the Labor
Department figures was a temporary phenomenon, and the fact they
were buying stocks showed how resilient the market was.
   In its report, the Labor Department also said the unemployment
rate rose to 5.4 percent from October's 5.3 percent.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond skidded about $13 per
$1,000 in face value on the employment data because of the prospect
of higher interest rates. The bond's yield surged to 9.14 percent
from late Thursday's 9.02 percent.
   The most-actively traded issue on the NYSE today was RJR Nabisco,
which slipped ~ to 90~.
   Other decliners included AT&T, down { at 28~, and Exxon, which
slipped { to 42{.
   Technology stocks were among the gainers. IBM picked up 1[ to
119] and Hewlett Packard was up 1 at 50.

   The U.S. dollar turned mixed against the major
European currencies on Friday. Gold prices also varied.
   The news that non-farm payrolls in the United States rose by
463,000 in November, exceeding expectations by some 200,000, helped
the dollar early in the day.
   But London dealers said the U.S. currency couldn't hold most of
the rise because of sales of dollars in Tokyo, a large, unidentified
order to buy sterling, and some profit-taking.
   News that the U.S. unemployment rate in October was revised
upward to 5.4 percent from 5.3 percent also hurt the dollar.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8597 late Friday, more
expensive for buyers than Thursday's late $1.8535.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with Thursday's late

   Prices fell on Wall Street today after the Labor
Department released better-than-expected employment figures for
November.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was down 12.80 to
2,089.08 as of 3 p.m. EST.
   Declining issues were ahead of advancers by a margin of about
5-to-3, with 853 issues falling, 514 rising and 535 unchanged in New
York Stock Exchange trading.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed stocks was down 0.62
to 152.75 On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index
slipped 0.50 to 294.75.
   Volume on the Big Board came to a light 103.84 million shares
with one hour of trading left.
   The Labor Department's eagerly awaited report on November
employment disappointed traders because of an increase of 463,000
new jobs _ an indication that the economy remains robust.
   Bond prices tumbled on the news and stock prices followed suit
because of the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would move
interest rates higher to cool the economy down and keep a lid on
inflation.
   ``With employment soaring and capacity so full, the Fed's going
to have to lean against the economy and raise the discount rate,''
said Larry Wachtel, a market analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   Interest in blue chip issues picked up and then subsided in
afternoon trading.
   ``A lot of investors are looking for an entry into the market,''
said Michael Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. ``If you're
going to get into the market, you've got to do it on weakness.''
   In its report, the Labor Department also said the unemployment
rate rose to 5.4 percent from October's 5.3 percent.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond skidded about $15.50 per
$1,000 in face value on the employment data because of the prospect
of higher interest rates. The bond's yield surged to 9.17 percent
from late Thursday's 9.02 percent.
   The most-actively traded issue on the NYSE today was RJR Nabisco,
which slipped ~ to 90~.
   Other decliners included AT&T, down | at 28}, and Exxon, which
slipped { to 42{.
   Technology stocks were among the gainers. IBM picked up } to 119
and Hewlett Packard was up 7 at 49~.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Surge on South American Concern</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices closed sharply higher
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade on reduced chances for a wet
weekend in the South American soybean belt and strong gains in the
soybean oil market.
   Grain futures finished mostly higher.
   Concerns about the unusually dry weather in Brazil and Argentina,
the world's second- and fourth-largest soybean producers, have
become the dominant factor in the U.S. soybean futures market since
planting began in those countries earlier this fall.
   Forecasts for a rainy weekend in Brazil had prompted active
selling of futures on Thursday but Friday's forecasts indicated
chances for rain were diminishing, and that sparked a rally,
analysts said.
   ``We ended up with a little bit of emotional action in the last
hour of trading _ we were up and down here,'' said Jerry Gidel, an
analyst in Chicago with the G.H. Miller division of LIT America Inc.
   Rumors that Brazil was considering importing soybean oil from
Argentina, either for its own needs or to export, sent soybean oil
futures prices up sharply and added support to the soybean market,
Gidel said.
   At the close of trading, wheat was 1{ cents lower to 3 cents
higher with the contract for delivery in December at $4.19 a bushel;
corn was 1\ cents lower to 1\ cents higher with December at $2.58{ a
bushel; oats were 3{ cents to 6 cents higher with December at $1.94{
a bushel; soybeans were 8 cents to 11 cents higher with January at
$7.69 a bushel.

<HEAD>KKR Discloses Details of RJR Financing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. unveiled on Friday
the financing plan for its record $24.53 billion purchase of RJR
Nabisco Inc. that includes a complex assortment of bank loans, junk
bonds and some cash from its own pocket.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
powerful Wall Street buyout firm illustrated the techniques it
typically uses in leveraged buyouts, only on a far grander scale.
   The LBO concept is quite simple: After making a small
downpayment, a firm and its investors borrow the rest of the
purchase and pay off that debt with funds generated by a target
company's profits or asset sales. In effect, the business itself is
used as collateral.
   The borrowing process, though, can get confusing.
   ``A lot of the financing is just plain vanilla. That's not the
case here,'' said Robert Waill, a high-yield bond specialist with
L.F. Rothschild Holdings Inc.
   The RJR buyout will require more than $20 billion in loans to
finance the cash portion of the $109-a-share offer accepted
Wednesday by a special RJR directors committee. Kohlberg's offer was
selected over a $25.2 billion bid from a group led by F. Ross
Johnson, RJR's chief executive.
   Besides getting $81 in cash for each of their shares, RJR
stockholders will receive a total $4 billion in preferred stock and
$2.3 bilion in convertible bonds.
   Kohlberg said in its SEC filing that four banks _ Bankers Trust,
Chase Manhattan, Citibank and Manufacturers Hanover Trust _ will
lend $2.7 billion themselves and assemble a syndicate of other banks
to lend an additional $14 billion.
   Kohlberg's two main Wall Street financial backers, Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co., will provide $5 billion in
short-term ``bridge loans'' that will be repaid by selling
high-yield, high-risk ``junk bonds,'' according to the SEC filing
and a spokeswoman for Kohlberg.
   Another $5 billion of existing RJR debt also could become
downgraded to junk bonds in the processs since the acquistion will
more than quadruple the company's existing debt to $22.3 billion.
   The buyout also will make RJR the largest single junk bond
issuer, analysts said. Union Carbide Corp. now holds that
distinction, with $4.2 billion.
   ``One major difference is that Union Carbide didn't issue them
all at once,'' said Kenneth Urbaszewski, who manages $4 billion in
junk bonds at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago.
   But Urbaszewski believes the high-yield market can absorb the
deluge of expected RJR debt, as long as those issues are priced
right.
   ``There's plenty of cash out there now,'' he said.
   Urbaszewski noted that despite the huge resulting debt load,
RJR's ratio of debt to equity would be only 3-to-1, which is
considered low for a leveraged buyout. By contrast, Kohlberg's 1986
buyout of supermarket giant Safeway Stores Inc. for $4.2 billion
left the acquired company with a debt-to-equity ratio of 10-to-1.
   The higher the debt load the harder it is for a company to pay
off its loans.
   For its part, Kohlberg is putting up $1.5 billion in cash for the
RJR acquisition, most of which will come from a $5 billion pool of
capital invested by institutional investors. Kohlberg also is
lending $500 million for the acquisition, the filing said.
   A Kohlberg spokeswoman said she did not know exactly how much of
the $1.5 billion in cash was coming from the buyout firm itself.
However, the Washington Post reported Friday that Kohlberg planned
to put only slightly more than $15 million of its own money into the
purchase.

<HEAD>NYSE Member Firms Report Profit Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York Stock Exchange members that do business
with the public saw their after-tax profits drop sharply in the
third quarter, the exchange reported Friday.
   In the July-September period, net earnings for the 378
corporations and partnerships that trade on the exchange fell to
$193 million, the report said. That was down 47.1 percent from $365
million in the second quarter and off 61.4 percent from $500 million
in the third quarter last year.
   Revenue in the latest quarter totaled $13.193 billion, the third
highest level in the history of the exchange. That was up 6 percent
from $12.449 billion in the second quarter but down 2 percent from
$13.412 billion in the same quarter of 1987.
   The NYSE said about 55 percent of the 378 firms reporting for the
quarter were profitable.
   The 207 profitable firms reported aggregate pre-tax earnings of
$698 million, while the 171 unprofitable firms reported an aggregate
loss of $406 million, the exchange said.
   After-tax profit for the latest quarter represented a 2.1 percent
annual return on the member firms' average net worth of $36.75
billion during the period. After-tax earnings are presented on a
pro-forma basis assuming a regular corporate tax rate or credit of
34 percent.
   The NYSE figures include revenue from all sources, including
trading and interest income, as well as commission revenue.
   Commission revenue amounted to 15.5 percent of total member firm
revenue, which was a record low, the NYSE said. Commissions provided
17.9 percent of revenue in the second quarter.
   NYSE specialists reported an after-tax profit of $18 million,
down 40 percent from $30 in the second quarter and off 61 percent
from $46 million in the third quarter last year.

<HEAD>Unocal Signs Agreement With Venezuela's State Oil Company</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Unocal Corp. signed a joint venture agreement
Friday with Venezuela's state oil company under which Unocal's
Chicago refinery and other assets will be transferred to the new
enterprise.
   Under the ``heads of agreement,'' similar to a letter of intent,
Unocal and Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. will each hold a 50 percent
share in the new venture.
   Officials said the new pact is contingent on the partners
negotiating acceptable crude oil supply agreements. But
   Unocal said it expects to realize in excess of $500 million if
the joint venture is completed.
   ``The formation of this joint venture would provide Unocal with
more reliable margins and significant cash which we will apply to
debt repayment or other uses,'' said Richard J. Stegemeier, Unocal
president and chief executive. ``At the same time, the venture would
provide Venezuela with a refined products market for its crude oil.''
   As reported on Thursday, the joint venture will involve refining
and distributing petroleum in 12 midwestern states. The deal
provides for a daily crude oil supply of 135,000 barrels.
   The assets to be transferred to the partnership include Unocal's
147,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Lemont, Ill., shares in pipelines
from the Gulf of Mexico to Lemont and 14 distribution terminals as
well as 149 Unocal service stations and a network of 190 marketers.
   The value of the assets involved in the deal was not disclosed,
but estimates are that they are worth approximately $700 million.
   Venezuela, a member of OPEC, has recently purchased other
refineries in the United States, including a 50 percent interest in
Citgo Petroleum Corp. and all of Champlin Refining Co.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Surge On Jobless Data, Argentina</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices of precious metals futures surged Friday on the Chicago
Board of Trade amid renewed inflation fears and jitters over a
military insurrection in Argentina, analysts said.
   On other markets, copper and cattle futures fell sharply; pork
futures were mixed; grains and soybeans were higher; energy futures
were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced.
   Analysts counted Friday's unemployment report as one bullish
factor in the precious-metals markets. The 5.4 percent November
jobless rate was near expectations but the increase of 463,000 new
jobs was much higher than the markets had anticipated, and many saw
it as a sign that wages and inflation may rise.
   ``If you're looking at precious metals as an inflation hedge, the
unemployment numbers were quite positive,'' said Jack Barbanel,
director of futures trading with Gruntal & Co., a New York brokerage
firm.
   Analysts also agreed that the dollar's weakness, following a
strong start, helped fuel the precious-metals rally.
   News reports of a mutinous clash between loyal and rebel military
factions near Buenos Aires, Argentina, may also have sparked some
buying among those who favor gold as a haven during turbulent times,
said Scott Hinton, an analyst with Elders Futures Inc. in New York.
   The rally accelerated when gold futures cracked a key technical
resistance point at around $432 on the contract for February
delivery.
   ``That really set the market off,'' Hinton said. ``You're getting
into an area where a lot of people are saying, `This downtrend is
over, it's time to get out of long-term short (or sell) positions.'''
   Gold settled $7.80 to $9.90 higher with the active February
contract at $436.70 an ounce and spot December at $431.70; silver
was 9 cents to 10.2 cents higher with active March at $6.335 a troy
ounce and spot December at $6.19. Platinum was $7.50 to $15 higher
with January at $615.90 a troy ounce.
   Copper futures sold off sharply in afternoon trading on the
Commodity Exchange on profit-taking ahead of the weekend and
uncertainty over the labor situation in Peru, where mineworkers have
been on strike for more than six weeks, analysts said.
   Copper settled .30 cent to 3.8 cents lower with December at
$1.502 a pound.
   Cattle futures prices plummeted on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange on mostly technical selling triggered when the price for
December delivery of live cattle slipped below 72 cents a pound.
   ``The market's kicking its foot in the dirt because it's kind of
disappointed it hasn't gone above 75 cents yet,'' said Jerry Gidel,
an analyst in Chicago with the G.H. Miller division of LIT America
Inc.
   Live cattle settled .52 cent to 1.42 cents lower with December at
71.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .45 cent to .83 cent lower
with January at 82.32 cents a pound; live hogs were .48 cent lower
to .35 cent higher with December at 40.35 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .30 cent to .43 cent higher with February at 45.37
cents a pound.
   Soybean futures prices settled sharply higher on the Chicago
Board of Trade on reduced chances for a wet weekend in the South
American soybean belt and strong gains in the soybean oil market.
Grain futures finished mostly higher.
   Concerns about the unusually dry weather in Brazil and Argentina,
the world's second- and fourth-largest soybean producers, have
become the dominant factor in the U.S. soybean futures market since
planting began in those countries earlier this fall.
   Forecasts for a rainy weekend in Brazil had prompted active
selling of futures on Thursday but Friday's forecasts indicated
chances for rain were diminishing, and that sparked a rally,
analysts said.
   Wheat settled 1 cent lower to 3 cents higher with December at
$4.19 a bushel; corn was 1\ cents lower to 1{ cents higher with
December at $2.58} a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 5{ cents higher
with December at $1.94\ a bushel; soybeans were 8 cents to 10} cents
higher with January at $7.68} a bushel.
   Crude oil prices rose while gasoline and heating oil futures
finished mostly lower in light trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude settled 3 cents to 4 cents higher
with January at $15.64 a barrel; heating oil was .22 cent lower to
.08 cent higher with January at 48.96 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .20 cent to .45 cent lower with January at 45.57 cents
a gallon.
   Stock-index futures retreated slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 settled .70 point lower at 272.50. Each point is worth
$500.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 4th graf to CORRECT that decliners outnumbered advancers.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices fell Friday but still displayed
signs of resilience after the Labor Department issued an employment
report that deepened investor concerns about inflation.
   ``The market absorbed the negative news fairly well _ I didn't
see a selling rout by any means,'' said Ralph Acampora, a market
analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Co.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 9.60 to 2,092.28
after having been down about 17 points in early trading. The index
closed out the week with a 17.60-point gain.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 4-to-3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
822 issues down, 616 up and 504 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to a sluggish 124.61 million
shares, down from 129.38 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market,
totaled 150.79 million shares.
   The Labor Department's monthly report on employment had been
eagerly awaited by financial markets for indications on the
direction of the economy.
   But the news that 463,000 new jobs were created last month came
as a blow to traders because it meant the economy remained strong.
The markets believed the higher-than-expected gain in jobs would
prompt the Federal Reserve Board to raise its discount rate to keep
a lid on inflation.
   Bond prices slumped on the news, with the Treasury's 30-year
issue skidding about $15 per $1,000 in face amount by late
afternoon. Meanwhile, the bond's yield surged to about 9.16 percent
from late Thursday's 9.02 percent, and short-term interest rates
also moved higher.
   Wall Street took its cue from the credit markets, opening lower
and continuting to slide. But as the afternoon wore on, blue chip
issues recovered some lost ground.
   ``Most market participants were suprised that the market was not
hit harder,'' said Alfred Goldman, an analyst with A.G. Edwards &
Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   Acampora, the Kidder Peabody analyst, said, ``A lot of the
negative news was already discounted in the market.''
   Goldman said Wall Street faces a critical test in coming sessions
because of competition from the increasingly attractive yields of
short-term debt and money-market instruments.
   ``One-year T (Treasury) bills offer extremely stiff competition
for the stock market,'' Goldman said. Yields on one-year bills
reached 8.94 percent by late Friday.
   If the Dow Jones industrial average falls through the 2,030 mark
and other market indicators drop below important psychological
levels, ``Christmas and the first of the new year will bring little
cheer, and there will be trouble well into the first quarter'' for
Wall Street, Goldman said.
   However, if stocks ``hold at these levels, it will signal that
there are enough buyers around who feel that stocks are
attractive,'' he said.
   The most-actively traded issue on the NYSE was RJR Nabisco, which
fell 1 to 90}.
   Technology issues were among the gainers. IBM rose 1 to 119\,

   The government's report of stronger-than-expected
job growth in November stunned the bond market Friday, sending
prices sharply lower and interest rates higher on speculation that
the Federal Reserve may tighten credit conditions to slow economic
growth.
   Bond traders who were anticipating a rise of about half of the
463,000 new jobs reported were ``shocked by the numbers'' and sold
bonds on the report, said Maury Harris, economist for the investment
firm PaineWebber Inc.
   The selloff was described as orderly, however, and the market
soon stabilized at the lower levels.
   Some analysts said the job growth figure indicated the economy is
expanding so quickly that the Federal Reserve will move to tighten
credit, and possibly boost the rate it charges on loans to financial
institutions, to slow the economy down and avoid a resurgence of
inflation.
   Elliott Platt, fixed-income research director for Donaldson
Lufkin & Jenrette Securities, said chances of a half-point increase
in the Fed's discount rate to 7 percent next week ``are fairly
high.''
   But Harris and some other analysts said they did not expect the
Fed to raise the discount rate so quickly, and pointed to other
parts of the same jobs report as evidence that the economy is not
overheating.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond dropped 1] points, or
$13.75 for every $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which moves in
the opposite direction from its price, climbed to 9.16 percent from
9.02 percent late Thursday.
   The Shearson Lehman Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, dropped 9.26 to 1,129.20, its biggest one-day
drop since it fell 9.48 on Nov. 4 after the October employment
report also showed unexpected strength.
   Short-term interest rates rocketed higher. Yields on one-year
Treasury bills, for instance, jumped to 8.94 percent from 8.63
percent late Thursday.
   The activity was triggered early Friday when the Labor Department
reported 463,000 jobs were created in November. Many analysts had
expected an increase of about 250,000.
   But some economists said the market appeared to overlook other
evidence contained in the report that suggested another view of the
economy.
   ``It really isn't as strong as it seems,'' said Robert Brusca,
chief economist for Nikko Securities International.
   Marshall B. Front, vice president at the investment firm Stein
Roe & Farnham in Chicago, said the report showed the economy may be
moderating.
   He said the unemployment rate, for instance, rose a tenth of a
percentage point to 5.4 percent in November, the average work week
edged down 12 minutes and average hourly wages were unchanged. In
addition, Front noted, the report revised estimated job growth in
October to 238,000 from the 323,000 initially reported.
   ``I'll bet they won't raise the discount rate. There are enough
signs of easing in the economy to forestall such an increase,'' he
said.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments fell by { point to | point, intermediate maturities lost
~ point and 20-year issues fell nearly a full point, according to
Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   In corporate trading, industrials were lower. Moody's Investment
Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, fell 1.70
to 293.43.
   In the tax-exempt market, prices fell more than { point,
according to the Bond Buyers index of 40 actively-traded municipal
issues.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.31 percent as the
discount climbed 20 basis points to 8.04 percent. Yields on
six-month bills rose to 8.72 percent as the discount jumped 25 basis
points to 8.25 percent. With yields on one-year bills rising to 8.94
percent, the discount on those issues rose 27 basis points to 8.28
percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 8 9-16 percent, up from 8{ percent late
Thursday.

<HEAD>Universal Foods Chairman Says He'll Fight Takeover Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Universal Foods Corp. Chairman Jack Murray says
he will ask his company's board of directors to fight a $520 million
takeover bid from a Massachusetts company.
   The cash tender offer, launched Thursday by Amanda Acquisition
Corp., a subsidiary of High Voltage Engineering Corp., amounted to
$30.50 a share for the 96 percent of Universal stock it does not own.
   Murray said Friday the company is not for sale, although
officials of High Voltage said earlier they had no plans to move the
Milwaukee-based food processing company.
   ``We have absolutely no intention of moving the company out of
Milwaukee or changing the senior management,'' said Clifford Press,
deputy chairman of High Voltage Engineering, based in Burlington,
Mass.
   Universal had net income last year of $24.8 million, or $2.10 a
share, on revenue of $711.5 million. High Voltage had sales of about
$112 million last year.
   Press said the offer would be financed by $340 million from Chase
Manhattan Bank and the remainder from Hyde Park Parners, a company
he owns with Laurence Levy.
   Levy dismissed Murray's objections, saying: ``With all due
respect, it is not up to senior management to elect whether the
company's for sale. It's up to the shareholders.''

<HEAD>Farley Calls for Special Meeting of Pepperell Shareholders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farley Inc. said Friday it would ask shareholders
of textile giant West Point-Pepperell Inc. to hold a special meeting
to consider Farley's $1.4 billion tender offer to acquire Pepperell.
   Spokesman David Kronfeld of West Point, Ga.-based Pepperell said
the company would have no comment on Farley's request.
   Farley, Chicago-based owner of Fruit of the Loom underwear and
other companies, extended its offer Thursday, saying it had garnered
nearly 50 percent of Pepperell's stock. The offer, which was to
expire at midnight Wednesday, was extended by one week to midnight
EST Dec. 7.
   Farley said today that Pepperell shareholders of record as of
Monday are entitled to call for a special meeting. Under Georgia
law, the company said, Pepperell management must call such a meeting
if shareholders of record of 25 percent of outstanding shares
support it.
   ``Our intention has always been to conduct friendy negotiations
on a mutually acceptable business combination, but Pepperell
management refuses to talk to us and has impeded shareholders from
even considering our offer,'' said chairman William Farley in a
statement.
   ``We have no choice but to seek a special meeting where
shareholders can decide for themselves whether our $48-per-share
cash tender offer should succeed,'' he said. ``Shareholders have
that right.''
   Farley officials said Thursday a preliminary count showed that
about 11.4 million shares of Pepperell's common stock had been
tendered by shareholders as of the close of business Wednesday. With
the shares Farley already owns, that would give the company about 49
percent of Pepperell's stock.
   Farley officials have declined to say how much of the Georgia
company's stock they hope to acquire.
   An appeals court has scheduled a hearing the week of Jan. 9 to
determine the fate of Pepperell's ``poison pill'' shareholder rights
plan, designed to thwart hostile takeovers. Farley's offer is
contingent on getting the plan overturned.
   Farley also has gone to court to challenge the constitutionality
of Georgia's anti-takeover law, but no hearing date has been set on
that issue.

   Pillsbury Co., the object of a $5.23 billion
hostile takeover bid, announced Friday it has agreed to sell its
Grain Merchandising Division, a chain of restaurants and a food
division.
   Pillsbury spokesman Larry Haeg denied that the sales, terms of
which were not disclosed, were made in reaction to the takeover
attempt.
   ``It is consistent with the restructuring effort that was
underway for quite some time to focus in on our core businesses,''
said Haeg, who added that plans to sell the Grain Merchandising
Division were announced July 25.
   Grand Metropolitan PLC's takeover efforts first came to light in
early October, he noted.
   Grand Met, a British liquor and gambling conglomerate, launched
its $60-a-share, all-cash tender offer for Pillsbury on Oct. 4.
Grand Met's fifth offer was set to expire at midnight EST Friday
unless extended again.
   Haeg declined to comment on Pillsbury's plans Friday. ``As a
matter of policy, we have never responded to those offers,'' he said.
   Grand Met spokesman Walter Montgomery refused to comment on what
Grand Met planned to do once the offer expired. He also wouldn't say
if Grand Met had heard from Pillsbury.
   Pillsbury sold its Grain Merchandising Division to ConAgra Inc.,
a diversified food company based in Omaha, Neb., with annual sales
of $9.5 billion.
   The Pillsbury division consists of 50 grain facilities primarily
in the Upper Midwest and about 200 river barges that are owned or
leased by Pillsbury, Haeg said.
   ConAgra spokeswoman Lynn Phares said the company ``fully expects
to hire a large percentage of those employees.'' Haeg said about 750
people are currently employed at the Grain Merchandising Division.
   The sale should be completed by the end of January, said Phares,
vice president of public relations at ConAgra.
   Haeg said it was not known how much the division was worth, but
said it was part of the company's industrial foods division, which
had sales of $416 million last year.
   The Minneapolis-based food and restaurant giant also said it was
selling Bay Street, a chain of 12 seafood restaurants based in
Dallas. The chain was sold to Bay Street Restaurant Inc., a
management group led by Bay Street General Manager Alan R. Palmieri
and Bill Bouffard, president of Restaurant Capital Corp., an
investment group, Pillsbury said in a statement.
   Also sold was Ashford Creameries, a division of Fiesta Foods Ltd.
of the United Kingdom, marketer of frozen desserts and ice cream. It
was sold to London-based Hillsdown Holdings PLC.

<HEAD>Disney Purchase of L.A. TV Station from RKO Completed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   RKO General Inc. on Friday completed the
$320 million sale of Los Angeles television station KHJ to The Walt
Disney Co., marking a milestone toward ending a 23-year dispute
between RKO and federal regulators.
   Of the purchase price, $103 million, or 32 percent, goes to a
broadcast company that challenged the fitness of RKO and its parent,
GenCorp, to hold a broadcaster's license. GenCorp, based in
Fairlawn, Ohio, gets $217 million, the companies said.
   The payment to the challenger, Fidelity Television Inc., was
ordered by the Federal Communications Commission as part of a
settlement of license challenges based on allegations of improper
billings and other FCC rule violations by RKO.
   The commission stripped RKO of one television license in 1980,
and, in effect, is forcing the company to sell KHJ and its 13 other
radio and TV stations on unfavorable terms.
   Sale of KHJ, the biggest of RKO's stations and the starting point
of the dispute, is intended to serve as a model for disposal of the
rest of the stations.
   ``This signals a watershed event for us,'' said GenCorp spokesman
Rip Tilden. ``We're out of operation of KHJ-TV ... We're getting out
of the broadcast business.''
   The sale was completed a day after KHJ's broadcast license came
up for renewal and was awarded to Los Angeles-based Fidelity. The
sale agreement calls for Disney to run the station and for Fidelity
to eventually transfer the license to Disney.
   The sale was set up by a settlement among RKO, various
competitors and the FCC that was approved by the commission in July.
The arrangement, which FCC records indicate was intended to both
punish RKO and bring the dispute to a speedy end, calls for sale of
the company's remaining properties _ a TV station and nine radio
stations _ on similar terms.
   RKO's trouble with the FCC began in 1965, when Fidelity
challenged its fitness to hold a license for KHJ. In that complaint
and in other challenges ultimately filed to all RKO's licenses, the
company's business practices and the corporate character of its
parent, then known as General Tire & Rubber Co., were called into
question.
   In a 1980 ruling that stripped RKO of its license to run WNAC-TV
in Boston, the commission found that GenCorp, RKO and the various
stations had engaged in improper billing, submission of false
financial statements and demonstrated lack of concern for FCC rules
and federal laws.
   In weighing the challenges, the commission also considered
evidence General Tire had engaged in ``schemes which defrauded
partially owned affiliate companies of millions of dollars,'' made
improper political contributions and bribed foreign officials to
further its business interests, according to FCC records.
   GenCorp spokesman Tilden noted the company hasn't acknowledged
any violations of FCC rules. He said the decision to sell all the
stations and eliminate RKO is in keeping with a GenCorp business
strategy of focusing on its main industrial operations, which
include making aerospace and automotive components and plastic
products.
   ``We feel we are perfectly fit to operate a broadcast station,''
Tilden said.
   One of the unusual aspects of the settlement is the FCC's
allowing Disney _ which wasn't a part of the license challenges _ to
enter as a ``white knight'' to buy KHJ.
   ``We've always taken a position with the commission that we
thought Disney would be a nice opportunity to get someone in there
to resolve what has been a messy situation for 20 years,'' said Neil
McCarthy, the Disney vice president who arranged the deal.
   Sale agreements similar to the KHJ deal have been approved for
RKO's WHBQ-AM in Memphis, Tenn.; WGMS-AM in Bethesda, Md.; WGMS-FM
in Washington, D.C., and WRKO-AM and WROR-FM in Boston.
   The company is seeking buyers for WOR-AM and WRKS-FM in New York
City; KRTH-AM and KRTH-FM in Los Angeles; KFRC-AM in San Francisco;,
WAXY-FM in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; WFYR-FM in Chicago; and WHBQ-TV in
Memphis.

   News that record numbers of Americans are working jolted the
financial markets by raising fears that the Federal Reserve will
tighten credit to squelch rapid economic growth and pre-empt higher
inflation.
   The Labor Department said Friday that civilian unemployment in
November edged upward to 5.4 percent from a 14-year low of 5.3
percent, largely because of an expansion in the civilian labor force.
   But the department's report also showed an increase of nearly a
half-million new jobs, which means a record 116 million Americans or
62.6 percent of the adult population are gainfully employed.
   The number frightened bondholders because it suggested the
economy is growing so rapidly that inflation will rise, forcing the
Fed to raise interest rates, the standard remedy for taming a
growth-price spiral. Higher interest rates hurt bonds and other
fixed-income investments.
   The Treasury's key 30-year bond lost $13.75 per $1,000 in face
amount and its yield, which often portends other interest rate
increases, rose to 9.16 percent from 9.02 percent late Thursday.
   The bond market's anxiety spilled into the stock market, though
not as badly. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 9.60 to
2,092.28, closing out the week with a 17.60 point gain.
   Ordinarily, higher interest rates rally the dollar, because they
make dollar-denominated holdings worth more. But in a curious twist,
the dollar fell Friday because foreign-exchange traders didn't
foresee an immediate move by the Fed to tighten credit.
   The unemployment report dominated the news Friday and obscured
other government statistics that presented a mixed picture.
   The Commerce Department said sales of new, single-family homes
rose 3.5 percent in October to the highest level in more than 1{
years. It followed a drop of 1.4 percent in September.
   The department also said U.S. factory orders rose $3.5 billion,
or 1.6 percent, in October to a seasonally adjusted $226.2 billion
on the strength of big gains in orders for military ships and tanks.
   But the key category of non-defense capital goods, considered a
good barometer of industry investment plans, fell 3.0 percent to
$33.8 billion, following a large 10.2 percent drop in September.

   Energy futures closed the week on a high note as
investors remained optimistic that OPEC would stick to its latest
production agreement.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange Friday, the January contract
for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,
settled 3 cents higher at $15.64 after trading as high as $15.74.
Other contract months also advanced slightly.
   Refined petroleum products traded on the exchange were mostly
lower in what analysts said were technical factors.
   The January contract for unleaded gasoline declined 0.41 cent to
settle at 45.57 cents a gallon, while other contract months also
fell. January heating oil closed down 0.22 cent at 48.96 cents a
gallon, while other contract months finished mixed.
   Analysts said the optimism begun after last Monday's decision by
OPEC to drastically reduce production managed to carry through the
week despite skepticism that the agreement would last.
   ``Two weeks ago you couldn't find a bull; now you can't find a
bear,'' said Jim Fiedler, vice president in charge of energy
brokering for E.D.&F. Man International Futures Inc.
   The 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
agreed Monday to reduce its volume by about 4 million barrels a day
to 18.5 million barrels. The cartel also agreed to maintain its old
benchmark price of $18 a barrel.
   Immediately after the announcement, oil prices surged to $15.80 a
barrel, its high for the week, leveled off on Tuesday, then climbed
the rest of the week but failed to reach Monday's highs.
   Statements of support for the agreement from various OPEC
representatives during the week helped keep prices strong, analysts
said. In addition, prices were supported by talk that non-OPEC
producing nations were considering the possibility of reducing their
output to help soak up the current world oil glut and ensure the
success of the accord.
   Analysts and brokers remained mixed in their assessment of where
prices would head in coming weeks.
   Mike Hiley, a broker for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., saidthe
market is unlikely to make further headway until it receives
confirmation of whether OPEC will stick to its agreement. Until
then, he believes prices will drift in the $15 range of this week.
   ``OPEC has milked the agreement for all it's worth and now the
market is waiting until January to what's going to happen,'' Hiley
said.
   The OPEC accord is scheduled to take effect Jan. 1.

   RJR Nabisco Inc.'s chief executive is cooperating
with the buyout firm that defeated him in a frenetic takeover
struggle for the cigarette-food giant, formally signaling he has no
intention of reopening the fight.
   ``As you well know, we have just concluded what has been a long,
difficult and arduous process,'' F. Ross Johnson said in a joint
letter with Henry R. Kravis, a principal in the investment firm
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
   ``However, that process has ended and it is now most important
that we return immediately to actively and vigorously running our
business,'' said the letter, sent Friday to RJR's 120,000 employees
worldwide.
   Addressing the concern of employees about their futures, the
letter also attempted to assure employees them that ``all of your
existing health and medical plans, and all of your retirement and
pension plans will continue in full force and effect.''
   The letter also said Kohlberg has ``great flexibility and is
under no pressure to make immediate divestitures.''
   Nevertheless, the letter confirmed press accounts that the new
owner anticipated ``that the sale of $6 billion in various food
assets is likely to occur over the next twelve to twenty-four
months.''
   There was no further indication of what those assets were, but
the letter told employees ``we can also assure you that there will
be no mass liquodations of our assets, or any mass layoff of
employees. Both our goal and commitment is to grow this company in a
most responsible manner.''
   Johnson was outmaneuvered by Kohlberg in a spectacular bidding
war for the nation's 19th largest industrial company, maker of
hundreds of products that range from Camel cigarettes to Oreo
cookies to Triscuit snacks.
   The struggle climaxed late Wednesday when RJR's directors
accepted Kohlberg's $109-a-share, $24.53 billion package of cash and
securities, the biggest takeover agreement in history.
   Kohlberg won despite a seemingly higher $112-a-share, $25.2
billion package of cash and securities offered by Johnson and his
financial backers, defying widespread predictions that the scrappy
RJR boss would win.
   The directors concluded both offers were substantially the same
and opted to go with the investment firm's because of its
established record in takeovers and its commitment to preserving as
much of the company as possible, post-mortem accounts of the
decision showed.
   They also were said to be dismayed at the brazen greed exhibited
by Johnson, who originally offered $75 a share for the company in
what he admitted was a deliberate buy-low approach.
   Johnson was said to feel cheated by the board's announcement and
his first reaction was to reiterate he believed his final offer was
better. He also dropped hints the battle was not over, saying he was
``exploring my options.''
   But the joint letter with Kravis showed he had scrapped any plans
to challenge the board's decision.
   Both offers were for leveraged buyouts, a high-finance
transaction in which the buyer puts up only a fraction of the
purchase price and borrows the rest, repaying it with the target
company's earnings, sale of assets or both.
   The highly publicized struggle focused new attention on leveraged
buyouts because they saddle companies with enormous debt and often
lead to their breakup. There is growing concern over whether
leveraged buyouts are playing a harmful role in the economy.
   Kohlberg's takeover of RJR will more than quadruple the company's
debt to nearly $24 billion, raising speculation the new owner will
have to sell substantial parts of the Atlanta-based giant to service
that debt.

   A dissident group of shareholders ended an attempt
to gain control of Zenith Electronics Corp. Friday, saying it was
satisfied the company was taking steps to improve the value of its
shares.
   The announcement ends the takeover battle that was launched Oct.
12 by Brookhurst Partners of New York, owner of 6.1 percent of
Zenith's stock.
   ``The continuing efforts of Zenith's management and board have
persuaded the company's shareholders that Zenith is pursuing
programs that will maximize shareholder value,'' said Herbert B.
Abelow, a leader of Brookhurst Partners.
   Zenith President Jerry K. Pearlman said his company would
continue discussions with other companies to find ways to bolster
the stock. The company has in the past said it might consider joint
ventures or the sale of some of its operations.
   ``We appreciate the keen interest our shareholders have shown in
the future of Zenith,'' Pearlman said in a statement.
   In their joint statement, Brookhurst and Zenith said they had
agreed to terminate all lawsuits they had pending against each other.
   Brookhurst, headed by stock-market speculators Abelow and
Nicholas Ihasz, had asked Zenith shareholders to support a plan to
seize control of the company's board and, in turn, sell Zenith's
ailing consumer-electronics division.
   Brookhurst had said that if it couldn't find a buyer for the
electronics unit, it would attempt to sell the entire company, which
is the last major U.S. manufacturer of television sets.
   Zenith, based in the Chicago suburb of Glenview, also makes
personal computers.
   Brookhurst's plan called for reducing the size of Zenith's board
from 10 directors to six and replacing some directors with its own
candidates.
   Brookhurst has cited Zenith's dismal earnings in recent years as
the reason for the unusual takeover bid.
   Zenith has posted multimillion-dollar losses in each of the past
three years but the company reported a $3 million profit for the
third quarter of 1988. It expects to show a pre-tax profit at the
end of this year.
