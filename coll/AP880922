   Opposition leaders demanded Thursday that
government troops stop arresting pro-democracy Buddhist monks and
students after military ruler Gen. Saw Maung pledged to hold
elections as soon as peace is restored.
   The capital was quiet for the third day since troops ruthlessly
suppressed protests against the military coup that Saw Maung led
Sunday.
   Saw Maung, who became prime minister Wednesday, is the third new
leader in two months of chaos and bloodshed. Like the two
government heads before him, he is closely associated with Ne Win,
who seized power in 1962.
   Ne Win resigned in late July after widespread protests against
26 years of authoritarian rule that plunged resource-rich Burma
into poverty. His successor, Sein Lwin, lasted for 17 days of
massive street protests. The next ruler, President Maung Maung, was
a civilian but was seen as close to the military.
   The United States said Thursday it was cutting off all aid to
Burma except humanitarian assistance. Rudi Boone, a State
Department spokesman in Washington, said he believed U.S. aid to
Burma totaled $12.3 million, but he did not know how much of the
aid is humanitarian.
   A letter sent to Saw Maung on Thursday from opposition leaders
Aung Gyi, Tin Oo, and Aung San Suu Kyi urged the government ``not
to arrest people including the monks, students, artists, etc., in
connection with the recent unrest and also to release those already
under detention.''
   Since the coup, security forces have broken up protest centers
manned mostly by monks and students in at least 95 towns. They have
reported only eight arrests in those sweeps. The government also
said security forces arrested 100 people in Rangoon; they were
described as looters.
   The opposition figures also urged Saw Maung, who was armed
forces commander before the coup, to end his ban on newspapers and
announce a list of casualties in shooting.
   The government has acknowledged security forces killed at least
146 people since the coup, but a Western diplomat put the figure as
high as 400, including many unarmed pro-democracy demonstrators.
   Opposition leaders did not reply to Saw Maung's letter received
Wednesday in which he said the army does not intend to hold onto
power for long and asked for help to prepare for what would be the
first multiparty elections since 1960.
   ``The army has no intention to retain the duties of state power
for a long time, in addition to its existing onerous duties. We had
to step in unavoidably because of the deteriorating general
conditions in the country,'' said the letter, Saw Maung's first
contact with the opposition leadership.
   ``We promise you that free and fair general elections will be
held as soon as peace and tranquillity is restored in the country.''
   The letter added that political parties will be allowed to use
government radio and television for their campaigns. But Saw Maung
did not set a date for the promised elections.
   Maung Maung, a civilian who was briefly president before being
ousted in Sunday's coup, bowed to massive street protests and
agreed to end one-party rule and hold multiparty elections as soon
as early October.
   But the opposition rejected that formula and instead continued
street demonstrations demanding an interim government be formed to
conduct the balloting.
   In Rangoon, more roadside shops were open Thursday than the
previous day, but large markets remained closed.
   The doors of government offices were open, but no one was
working. Most public employees have been on pro-democracy strikes
since Aug. 8 and the government has set an Oct. 3 deadline for them
to return to work.
   Sketchy reports received from Mandalay, the second-largest city,
and other towns indicated security forces and protesters fought
this week, though not as fierce as in the capital.
   State radio said security forces arrested eight people Wednesday
night in a sweep of the protest center at Mandalay University and
killed two other people in separate incidents in the city. Mandalay
is about 350 miles north of Rangoon.
   Also Wednesday night, a group of people sent about 50 water
buffaloes after soldiers on the Mandalay Golf Course and attacked
the troops with catapults and metal darts. The radio said the
attackers escaped but five buffaloes were reported killed.
   A diplomat said a few U.S. Embassy officials in Rangoon would be
evacuated to Bangkok in the next few days. More than 100 dependents
of staff members were evacuated earlier.
   ``The embassy remains open. This is as a precaution,'' said Ross
Petzing, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok.
   Japan expressed concern Thursday about political developments in
Burma and said it would wait to decide whether to recognize the new
military government. Tokyo is the largest foreign aid donor to
Rangoon although official assistance has dropped recently.
   Burma, once the world's largest rice exporter, last year joined
40 other countries officially designated by the United Nations as
``least developed nation.''
   Officials said the Soviet Union and the European Economic
community protested the recent bloodshed. The United States earlier
said it might withdraw aid in light of the military coup and
bloodshed.

   A new generation of skyscrapers is about to alter
the skyline of Atlanta, previously dismissed as sterile and
nondescript.
   Even homegrown architect John Portman, whose glass towers and
soaring atriums for years defined Atlanta and who in the past
criticized post-modern architecture as a step backward, has given a
nod to the style in his latest project, a 60-story office building
planned for downtown Atlanta.
   Much of the excitement over the pending transformation of the
capital of the New South started last fall with the opening of the
50-story IBM building. Officially called One Atlantic Center, it is
a slender, post-modern tower of stone with tall arched entryways
and Gothic finials, dramatically crowned by a 100-foot-high,
eight-sided copper pyramid topped by a golden lantern.
   Rush-hour traffic on Interstate 85 slows to a cautious crawl as
drivers gaze its way. At night, the lights in its crown command
attention from all over town. Architecture writers have used words
like ``gracious,'' ``truly wonderful,'' ``serene,'' ``imposing''
and ``glamorous'' to describe the tower.
   ``It certainly projects a vibrance to the rest of the world,''
said Roy Cooper, vice president for economic development with the
Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. ``It's just beautiful. Everybody's
just staggered by it.''
   The tower is a dramatic departure from the glass boxes common in
modern architecture and contrasts with the sleek look of most of
the city's tallest buildings.
   Its influence shows up in at least three other skyscrapers going
up in Atlanta, and the design of the proposed Promenade skyscraper
complex was altered to complement the rose-colored IBM tower.
   New York architect John Burgee, whose firm designed the IBM
building with design consultant Philip Johnson, won't take credit
for transforming Atlanta's skyline. But he said the city's image,
as defined by the way it looks, is undergoing a change.
   ``Atlanta has been looking for its identity,'' Burgee said in a
telephone interview from his New York office. ``It's an historical
city (but) its architecture and image is not strictly historical.
You think of Atlanta and you think of `Gone With The Wind.' Now,
there is an attempt to come up with a visual image.
   ``We all know Peachtree Street, but you don't think of its
buildings,'' he said. ``Like in New York, the Empire State
Building; Chicago, the Sears building; San Francisco, the
TransAmerica building. Atlanta doesn't have that. It's moving
toward that, very definitely.''
   Burgee and Johnson also are behind One Ninety One Peachtree
Tower, a post-modern skyscraper planned for downtown Atlanta.
   Another planned project grouped in the ``Son of IBM'' building
spurt is the Promenade in the tree-lined, historic Midtown section,
a complex of three office buildings and a hotel being developed by
AT&T and the Atlanta-based Landmarks Group.
   When unveiled last year, it was designed with an exterior of
glittering green glass. But when Promenade officials saw the
excitement over the nearby IBM Tower, its architects, Thompson,
Ventulett & Stainback, redrew the plans to use rose glass above
rose-toned stone and topped with a gray steel spire.
   The most recently announced skyscraper is a downtown giant by
Portman, whose imprint is already deeply felt in Atlanta, primarily
through the Peachtree Center and the towering cylindrical Westin
Peachtree Plaza Hotel.
   Portman's new building is slated to begin construction next year
and, at 60 stories, will eclipse One Atlantic as the Southeast's
tallest building. Unveiling the design in May, Portman said it was
``respectful of the past but, like this city, is audacious and bold
and forward-looking _ the beginning of post-post-modern
architecture.''
   Dale Durfee, a professor of architecture at Georgia Tech, said
completion of the IBM tower signaled the acceleration of a change
in the look of the city that began a decade ago.
   ``Atlanta was pretty much plain vanilla,'' he said, ``with no
development of architectural significance.''
   Burgee echoed that appraisal, saying, ``It was pretty
nondescript. It might be anyplace. If they took you (to Atlanta)
blindfolded and took off the blindfold, you wouldn't have a clue
where you are.''
   Durfee said that 10 years ago, Atlanta was groping to form an
identity and had no demand for the type of buildings now are going
up.
   Today, however, companies want sophistication in their office
buildings, Durfee said, and corporate sponsorship of building
projects has changed the rules of skyscraper financing.
   Some say that all the building activity simply makes good
business sense.
   ``Sure, there's competitive prestige. Good architecture is good
business,'' said Truman Hartshorn, chairman of the geography
department at Georgia State University and a specialist in urban
affairs.
   A good-looking building, he said, ``is easier to sell to the
financing people as well as the tenants.''
   Hartshorn said he expects the new projects in Atlanta will bring
special recognition.
   ``I think it's going to open some eyes,'' he said. ``We have
prestige with our cultural buildings, but I don't know that our
office buildings are that distinctive nationally.
   ``These aren't just ultra post-modern. They're classic. They're
different.''

   State employees won't be dialing for
dollars any longer after their attempts to cash in on a $1,000
radio call-in contest brought the Capitol's telephone system to a
crashing halt.
   ``I guess the economy is so bad in Texas that everybody is
trying to get money,'' Carl Stringfellow, state director of
telecommunications, said Tuesday. ``But you shouldn't be using
state phones to be calling on to radio contests.''
   Officials reset the phone system to prevent any calls to the
exchange set aside for radio call-in contests after service was
disrupted several times, Stringfellow said.
   ``We thought we had just had an equipment failure,'' he said.
``But the second time it went down one of our employees suggested
it was at the same time as one of the radio contests.''
   Officials discovered the phone failure occurred within a minute
of the start of a contest by a local radio station offering a
$1,000 prize.
   The Capitol phone system has about 14,000 lines, and its usual
capacity is about 2,000 calls at any time. But the radio contest
bumped the phone traffic up to 8,000 calls, Stringfellow said.

   Forget about toga parties. Miami University
students have come up with something more relevant for the 1980s
and this presidential year _ the Pledge party.
   As in Pledge of Allegiance, of course.
   Police were responding for the second time to noise complaints
about a party at a student's house when Miami junior Bob LeBoeuf
led 150 to 200 revelers in the Pledge.
   ``I thought it'd be funny,'' said LeBoeuf, who led the group
from a trough containing beer kegs and ice. ``What are the police
going to do with 200 people standing around saying the pledge _
arrest them for being patriotic?''
   No, but they did cite host Kimberly A. Mart for violating the
city's noise ordinance after the patriotic partyers pushed police
noise meters over the town's 70-decibel limit. The citation, the
second given for the Sept. 10 party, could cost Mart $128. She was
scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday for the misdemeanor
violation.
   ``The officers were kind of laughing when they took the meter
reading,'' said Karen Stevens, 21, who lives at the house. ``People
weren't saying it in any hostile way. They had smiles on their
faces and some had hands over their hearts. No big deal, we
thought.''

<HEAD>Leading Mafia Investigator Agrees to Stay On</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italy's top Mafia investigator has withdrawn his
resignation, alleviating a crisis in the country's war on organized
crime.
   Giovanni Falcone, an investigating magistrate in the Sicilian
capital of Palermo, had charged when he offered his resignation
July 30 that Mafia investigations were obstructed.
   He also said his methods ``differ radically'' from those of his
superior, Antonino Meli, who was appointed chief investigating
magistrate of the anti-Mafia judicial ``pool'' in February.
   Falcone asked for a transfer and the other members of the pool
then announced their resignations.
   A former colleague of Falcone charged in July that Meli was
weakening the pool by assigning its judges non-Mafia cases and
sending Mafia cases to investigators outside the pool.
   Falcone told judicial officials Wednesday that he was staying on
``in conformance with the ruling'' last week by the Superior
Council of Magistrates, the national judicial watchdog that
appointed Meli.
   The council, praising the pool's work, found that Meli did not
divert cases and called on Falcone not to quit.
   Magistrates in the pool, especially Falcone, have been credited
for some of the country's biggest successes against organized
crime, including the ``maxi'' anti-Mafia trial that ended in
December with 338 convictions.
   U.S. authorities say Falcone provided critical help in
investigations such as the one leading to the New York trial of
suspects in the case of the ``Pizza Connection,'' which discovered
that pizza parlors in the United States were used as fronts for
heroin dealing.

   Heavily armed police sealed off a
12-block area Wednesday night after hearing sporadic gunfire in a
riot-scarred neighborhood where a white woman allegedly shot a
black man to death 24 hours earlier.
   An emergency zone was expanded late Wednesday night in the Cedar
Grove section soon after police rerouted traffic off a busy
thoroughfare where blacks were throwing rocks, bottles and bricks
at passing cars.
   No injuries or serious damages were reported Wednesday night,
and there were no arrests immediately reported in Louisiana's
third-largest city.
   The white woman was accused of murder in Tuesday night's
shooting and six blacks were arrested during the rioting that
followed, police said.
   Mayor John Hussey said the strategy Wednesday night was to wait
out troublemakers. Scores of police cars, a busload of camouflaged
Special Response Team officers and canine units were stationed at a
command post nearby.
   ``The shooting that we have is sporadic,'' said Hussey. ``It's
still very much in a local area. The idea is to seal off the area.
If you seal it off, don't let any cars through, then there's
nothing for them to throw at.''
   Though the atmosphere was tense, Police Chief Charles Gruber
said it was nothing like what the city faced after the earlier
rioting.
   Wednesday night's violence occurred hours after black leaders
called for Cedar Grove residents to stay calm and guard against a
recurrence of the burning and looting late Tuesday night and early
Wednesday.
   ``We're sitting on a powder keg,'' said state Rep. Alphonse
Jackson, who called for a biracial anti-crime committee.
   ``People want protection,'' said Jackson, who is black. ``I call
on citizens to restore law and order.''
   His plea followed a meeting of city officials and black leaders
to discuss the rioting that persisted nearly five hours, until 3
a.m. Wednesday, and which officials said was related both to drugs
and racial problems.
   Stores were looted and burned, and rioters threw rocks and
bottles at whites. There were reports of racial slurs and chants of
``Hot Biscuit,'' the restaurant where a white teen-ager killed a
black teen-ager on Aug. 4, an incident that set off racial tension
in this northwestern Louisiana city of 250,000, the state's
third-largest after New Orleans and Baton Rouge.
   Hussey and Gruber acknowledged at a news conference that the
sparks for the riots were the two shootings, but both said there
were deeper causes.
   ``We've got problems in our economy, we've got problems in our
racism, we've got many other problems,'' said Hussey, adding that
drinking and a soured drug deal preceded Tuesday's shooting.
   The Rev. E. Edward Jones, pastor of Galilee Baptist Church,
appeared with Hussey and Gruber. Jones said he and other black
leaders believe the chief deserves credit for ordering officers to
pull out of the riot area so the crowd could disperse without
bloodshed.
   ``We are asking our young people to remain at home as much as
possible, to dig in to their books and not to look for any
excitement,'' said Jones, president of the National Baptist
Convention of America Inc., the nation's second-largest black
Baptist organization.
   On Tuesday night, police cordoned off a seven-block area and
warned motorists to keep out.
   The crowd reached 1,000 people at its peak, said Gruber, but
other police estimates said the total was 300 to 500 most of the
time.
   The police chief said his car took a brick through the
windshield and gunfire through the back passenger door, but he was
not hurt.
   A KTBS-TV news car was burned and a new fire department pumper
was attacked with bats and bricks.
   No serious injuries were reported, attributed in part to
Gruber's decision to let the disturbance run its course. Throughout
the incident, police radios crackled with orders to maintain
positions and hold fire.
   ``If Gruber had moved into the area, we would have had a large
number of people hurt, so I commend him for it,'' said Jackson.
   ``We chose to let it cool off,'' Gruber said. ``We felt our
presence would do nothing but accelerate it.''
   Six people were arrested, five on charges ranging from inciting
to riot to resisting arrest, and two of those and one other person
on on charges of possession of stolen goods.
   The outbreak was triggered by the shooting of a black man,
identified as William David McKinney, 20, who lived in the Cedar
Grove neighborhood where the rioting took place. He was described
by a witness as a bystander caught in gunfire when a drug deal went
bad.
   A white teen-ager, Tamala C. Vergo, 17, of Greenwood was booked
on a charge of second-degree murder, said police Cpl. E.T. Rushing.
A second woman was questioned but not charged.
   A man who identified himself only as a cousin of McKinney's
named Charles, said McKinney was shot at random after a woman
trying to buy cocaine from a group of men was robbed. When they ran
with her purse, she ``took out her frustration'' on McKinney, he
said.
   The man talked to reporters after being interviewed by
detectives.
   Officers said people in a convenience store tried to detain the
woman until police came, but a crowd of blacks gathered outside and
began throwing bricks at the business and all passing motorists who
were white.
   A witness, Anthony Johnson, said that after police took the
women away, the crowd doused the store with lighter fluid, set it
afire and went on a rampage. The building, containing the store and
a liquor shop, was burned to the ground.
   Patients and workers at Eden Gardens Nursing Center, across the
street, watched the burning and looting.
   ``Some of the guys had so much stuff in their bags they couldn't
walk,'' said Betty Truett, a nurse.
   Looting and fires also were reported in other stores in the area.
   About 200 police were called in, Gruber said, including state
troopers, sheriff's deputies, and officers from nearby Bossier City.
   In the Aug. 4 shooting, five white men were arrested and one
admitted the shooting, saying he was defending himself. He is being
held on $250,000 bond on second-degree murder charges. Charges
against three of the others were dropped in return for their
cooperation.
   The shooting enraged Shreveport's black community, but calm
prevailed when black ministers exhorted congregations to let police
handle the investigation.

<HEAD>Surprise: Summer Was Hot, Dry for Most Americans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the autumn equinox bids farewell to
summer today, millions of scorched Americans likely will be glad to
see it go.
   It was a bummer summer, in the words of one headline writer, a
season that saw millions of dollars lost in dying crops, rivers and
reservoirs dry up and air conditioning bills go through the roof.
   According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, only the Dust Bowl of the 1930s raised the nation's
average temperature to higher levels than this summer.
   Some communities may take pride in setting records for greatest
average heat _ or most 90 degree days or least rain.
   But that doesn't mean many want to see a return of the
record-setting misery anytime soon.
   The Agriculture Department estimates that heat coupled with
extraordinary dryness cut grain production by 31 percent,
threatening many farmers with financial disaster.
   And the U.S. Geological Survey noted that low water levels
curtailed irrigation and river traffic and raised pollution levels
in some areas.
   Wildfires swept large areas, discouraging tourists, scorching
homes and forests.
   And even something as simple as keeping cool had a significant
impact, with the cost of running air conditioners pushing the
national electric bill up to $14.4 billion, some $746 million more
than it would have been in normal summer weather.
   National statistics, though, obscure the impact of the hot, dry
season, which differed in degree and response from town to town,
but which was bad news nearly everywhere.
   From Minneapolis to Baltimore to Cheyenne the summer of 1988 was
the hottest in local climate records going back nearly 40 years.
   And by that same standard, the drought played to record levels
in Peoria and Pittsburgh, Billings, Mont., and Asheville, N.C.
   ``Abnormally hot weather during much of June-August in the Great
Basin, southern Intermountain Region, northern halves of the
Rockies and Great Plains and Midwest sent seasonal temperatures
averaging more than 4 degrees Fahrenheit above normal,'' the
federal Climate Analysis Center said.
   The summer's greatest heat focused on the region from central
Montana and northern Utah eastward to lower Michigan, with hundreds
of record highs and many cities setting records for consecutive
days of 90 degrees or more.
   It was the warmest summer in the last 58 years in the east north
central states and the third warmest in the west north central
region and the Mountain states.
   Drought, meanwhile, struck in the spring and persisted through
much of the summer in the northern Great Plains and the
Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee valleys. By mid-July, about 45
percent of the 48 contiguous states were experiencing severe or
extreme drought.
   Increased thunderstorm activity in the eastern portion of the
drought area eased the problem somewhat in late July and August,
but even so, several cities set records for dryness.
   Climate experts compile local records in 30-year chunks and use
the period from 1951-1980 as a standard for comparison for current
trends. They define summer as June, July and August.
   On that basis, at least seven cities recorded their driest
summer. They include Asheville, N.C., 5.39 inches of precipitation;
Peoria, Ill., 3.04 inches; Sheridan, Wyo., 0.91 inches; Havre,
Mont., 0.20 inches; Pittsburgh, 6.14 inches; Rockford, Ill., 4.81
inches; and Billings, Mont., 0.59 inches.
   For Peoria, for example, that represented only 27 percent of
normal rainfall for the season.
   Even more cities set records for the highest average summer
temperature since 1951, ranging from 86.7 in Tucson, Ariz., to 68.4
in Cheyenne, Wyo.
   Average temperatures are derived from daily highs and lows, and
the readings climbed as much as 6 degrees Fahrenheit above normal.
   Sheridan, Wyo., for example., was 6.3 degrees above normal,
while at Billings, Mont., the average was high by 5.8 degrees.
   Others among the communities setting record high average
temperatures for this summer were Newark, N.J., 77.7; Salt Lake
City, 77.5; Baltimore, 77.2; Sioux Falls, S.D., 76.1; Dayton, Ohio,
75.6; Minneapolis, 75.6; Huron, S.D., 75.2; Waterloo, Iowa, 75.0;
Billings, Mont., 74.7.
   Also, Rapid City, S.D., 74.7; Dubuque, Iowa, 74.3; Fargo, N.D.,
73.8; Milwaukee, 73.8; Williston, N.D., 73.0; Lander, Wyo., 72.9;
Sheridan, Wyo., 72.9; Akron, Ohio, 72.7; Casper, Wyo., 72.0; Reno,
Nev., 71.6; and Green Bay, Wis., 71.2.
   As if to prove there are exceptions to every rule, some
communities had cool and wet summers.
   Albuquerque, N.M., for example, recorded 6.81 inches of rainfall
this summer, a record at 208 percent of normal for the period.
   Summer rainfall totaled more than 47 inches at Homestead Air
Force Base in Florida, although there are no historical records for
comparison.
   Such places as Pensacola and West Palm Beach, however, topped 30
inches, which was more than 150 percent of normal.
   And Meacham, Ore., managed an average summer temperature of only
56.3 degrees, 3.6 degrees below normal.

   More Americans have high school diplomas and

on education in society, a new Census Bureau study shows.
   ``The entire post-Second World War era has been characterized by
an expansion of educational opportunities and structures in the
country,'' Census demographer Robert Kominski commented.
   His new study of educational attainment found that, as of March
1987, more than three-quarters of people aged 25 and over have
completed high school and nearly one in five has finished at least
four years of college.
   Both shares have been increasing gradually over the years, said
Kominski.
   ``In the 1960s the civil rights movement added another level of
opportunity. And the expansion of college grant and aid programs in
the '60s and '70s allowed this to continue,'' he said.
   Kominski added that changes in the age breakdown of the
population have also had an impact on education averages, as the
less educated elderly are replaced by younger people who have spent
more time in school.
   For example, people in their teens, with 80 percent to 90
percent completing high school, are replacing older folks who were
raised at a time when completion of six to eight years of schooling
was a major accomplishment, he explained.
   Does this mean that Americans today are smarter than in the past?
   ``Not necessarily,'' Kominski said. ``We all like to think that
we were raised in the generation which produced the best and the
brightest.''
   The study found that, overall, 75.6 percent of Americans have
completed high school and 19.9 percent had finished four years of
college. That was up from 74.7 percent and 19.4 percent a year
earlier and 68.6 percent and 17.0 percent in 1980.
   By comparison, in 1940 only 24.5 percent of Americans aged 25
and older had completed high school and 4.6 percent were college
graduates.
   The 1987 report also noted that males were slightly more likely
to have finished high school than women, 76.0 percent to 75.3
percent, a change from the early 1970s when women led in this
category.
   The shift is largely attributed to increasing share of black men
pursuing their educations, Kominski said.
   In 1971, he pointed out, the last time women led men in overall
share of high school graduates, young black women aged 25 to 29 led
men 60.7 percent to 54.1 percent in high school graduates. Last
year among young blacks 84.8 percent of males and 82.1 percent of
women had finished high school.
   Other findings for the population aged 25 and over included:
   _ Whites had 77.0 percent high school graduates and 20.5 percent
who finished four years of college. The figures for blacks were
63.4 percent and 10.7 percent. Other races, mostly Asians, had 78.4
percent high school grads and 33.4 percent who finished college.
   _ Hispanics recorded 50.9 percent who finished high school and
8.6 percent with college degrees.
   _ The West has the highest educational levels at 80.6 percent
high school and 22.8 percent with college degrees. Figures for
other regions were 76.5 percent and 22.2 percent in the East; 77.4
percent and 17.6 percent in the Midwest, and 70.8 percent and 18.3
percent in the South.
   _ In metropolitan areas 77.6 percent had finished high school
and 22.1 percent college, compared to 68.7 percent and 12.6 percent
in rural regions.
   _ The highest rate of high school graduates was for people aged
25 to 34 with 86.5 percent. That slipped to 85.9 percent in the 35
to 44 group, 77.6 percent for those aged 45 to 54, and 67.8 percent
for people aged 55 to 64. Americans aged 65 to 74 included 56.9
percent high school graduates, and over age 75 the rate was 42.0
percent.
   _ Those finishing college totaled 23.9 percent in the 25 to 34
age group, then peaked at 26.5 percent among people aged 35 to 44.
After that the rate declined, to 19.5 percent for those aged 45 to
54, 14.9 percent for the 55 to 64 group, 10.6 percent for those 65
to 74, and over 75 it was 8.9 percent.

<DATELINE>PATMOS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nightclubs and nudity are banned on this
island where tradition holds that St. John wrote the New
Testament's Book of Revelation in a cave overlooking the Aegean Sea.
   Under a special government decree, Patmos has a unique status
among Greece's 200 or so inhabited islands as a ``holy island''
still dominated by its 900-year-old Byzantine monastery.
   ``We prefer our visitors to be pilgrims rather than ordinary
tourists and we would like them to respect our tradition,'' Abbot
Isidoros, who heads the 30-member community at the Monastery of St.
John the Theologian, said in an interview.
   But plans for an airport coupled with widespread publicity for
the monastery's 900th anniversary celebrations are expected to
bring mass tourism to Patmos in the coming years.
   The tranquillity of Patmos, a rocky outcrop in the Dodecanese
group of islands with around 2,000 residents, attracts wealthy
Greeks and foreigners who have restored scores of traditional
mansions clustered beneath the monastery's gray fortress-like walls.
   Many have given donations to the monastery, to help maintain its
library of rare manuscripts and early books, along with a
collection of priceless icons _ portraits of saints painted in gold
and bright colors.
   ``Patmos is still a place apart, with a unique atmosphere.
Unlike other islands, a conscious effort has been made to protect
it,'' said Maria King Constantinides, a Boston antiques dealer with
a family home there.
   Signs in Greek, French, German or English scattered around the
island's beaches point out that nudity is not allowed. One disco
operates on a remote bay, but the narrow alleys around the
monastery fall silent by 10 p.m., even in summer.
   ``People sometimes go topless on the beaches, but ... on the
whole the rules are respected,'' said Christos Kyrozis, the
island's doctor and also its mayor.
   The development project planned by Greece's state tourist
organization EOT, together with the monastery and town authorities,
calls for construction of an airport, zoning for new hotels and
bungalows and improved harbor facilities.
   ``Past experience shows that once an island gets an airport,
mass tourism is very difficult to avoid,'' said Eleni Bonou, who
heads the project. ``But an airport is essential because it serves
the islanders first.''
   More than 30,000 visitors come to Patmos every year, but
two-thirds of them arrive aboard cruise ships that steam away
before sunset after a few hours' stay.
   On an island too barren to grow its own food, visitors are the
only source of income apart from fishing.
   ``There's a delicate balance to be kept between God and mammon
on this island,'' Mayor Kyrozis said. ``There has to be tourism,
but not so much it kills what we have to offer.''
   Trained for a more secluded life, the monks say it's already
hard work taking turns to supervise the tourists swarming through
the monastery museum, its frescoed chapels and stone colonnades.
   ``The sheer numbers of people coming through mean that we're
exhausted by the time the season's over and there's time to get on
with our own tasks,'' said Brother Chrysostomos, the monastery
librarian.
   The tourists also crowd into the Monastery of the Apocalypse,
built over the cave where St. John supposedly wrote his visionary
work while exiled on Patmos around A.D. 95.
   ``It's historical fact that St. John was on the island,'' said
Athanassios Kominis, an Athens University professor of Byzantine
studies. ``The tradition that he wrote Revelation there is
certainly more than speculation, but not quite certainty,''
   Patriarch Dimitrios, spiritual leader of Eastern Orthodox
Christians worldwide, plans to lead Orthodox, Roman Catholic and
Protestant churchmen in a two-day international pilgrimage to
Patmos Sept. 25-26.
   It celebrates the 900th birthday of the Monastery of St. John,
founded in 1088 by a Byzantine scholar, the Blessed Christodoulos
with special permission from the Emperor Alexius Comnenos.

<HEAD>House Considering Measure To Revoke Drug Users' Drivers' Licenses</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: tops prospects uncertain</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After expressing a mood that the House won't
tolerate any illegal narcotics use, lawmakers may be ready to
toughen anti-drug legislation by voting to revoke drug users'
drivers' licenses.
   As the House returns to its comprehensive anti-drug bill today,
lawmakers face two opposing amendments that could affect any
convicted drug offender's right to drive.
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., proposes withholding part of a
state's federal highway money unless the state requires suspension
or revocation of drivers' licenses of anyone convicted of a
drug-related crime.
   A substitute amendment by Rep. Glen M. Anderson, D-Calif.,
provides an incentive approach. Instead of penalties, states would
receive Transportation Department grants for imposing the license
penalties. The grants would pay part of the license enforcement
program.
   The overall anti-drug bill would add some $2 billion to the
nation's $3.9 billion effort against illegal drugs. While the House
expects to approve the legislation Thursday or Friday, the Senate
still must consider its own drug bill.
   A conference will almost certainly be needed to iron out
differences, but lawmakers appear eager to pass a popular
get-tough-on-drugs bill so close to the election.
   The House bill, as originally written, authorizes money and
innovative programs for drug law enforcement, rehabilitation,
treatment and education. Each time the House has amended the
measure during the past two weeks, it's civil, administrative, or
criminal penalties have toughened.
   Under McCollum's driver's license plan, states would have to
impose suspensions of at least six months for a first conviction
and at least one year for repeat convictions within a five-year
period.
   Five percent of a state's highway money would be withheld the
first year if there was no compliance, and 10 percent would be held
back for every subsequent year of non-compliance.
   The penalty for states would begin Oct. 1, 1991. Individuals
penalized would have to have been convicted after the drug measure
became law.
   The Anderson alternative would require the same six-month and
one-year penalties as required under the McCollum plan.
   The incentive program would offer states additional money
totaling $25 million in the 1989 fiscal year, $50 million in 1990
and $50 million in 1991.
   Anderson's proposal also would apply to those convicted after
the drug bill became law.
   Over the past two weeks, the House has inserted a number of
amendments to the drug bill that reflect an attitude of ``zero
tolerance'' toward any drug use, and a feeling that harsh penalties
are needed for those who deal in drugs or merely possess them.
   Liberal lawmakers have complained that the House has ignored the
Constitutional safeguards that protect civil liberties such as due
process of law.
   Amendments already approved would:
   _Permit the federal death penalty for anyone who intentionally
kills a person during the course of committing a drug felony.
   _Deny many federal benefits, including assistance to Veterans
and student loans, to anyone convicted of two or more drug-related
offenses.
   _Allow introduction of evidence in federal criminal cases that
was obtained through a search that violated constitutional
protections, but undertaken in good faith.
   _Create civil penalties of up to $10,000 per violation for
possession of small ``personal use'' amounts of marijuana, cocaine
and other drugs.
   The House also approved a requirement for a system that would
allow gun dealers to identify convicted felons attempting to buy
handguns. This amendment replaced language for a seven-day waiting
period for handgun purchases.

<HEAD>Izvestia Says Grain Harvest Down This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's grain harvest this year will be
smaller than the relatively good harvests of the two previous years
because of drought in the country's breadbasket, Izvestia reported.
   The Soviet government newspaper gave no figures, but said the
harvest was just drawing to a close and it was clear it would fall
short of the 231 million tons harvested in each of the past two
years.
   A significant shortfall in the grain harvest would be a blow to
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's efforts to improve food
supplies to consumers and reform agriculture. It also would require
the Soviet Union to use more of its scare foreign currency to buy
grain instead of machinery and equipment to modernize the economy.
   ``The summer drought has inflicted an appreciable blow on the
principle grainaries of the country _ the Volga region, the Urals,
western Siberia and northern Kazakhstan,'' Izvestia said in the
report Wednesday.
   It said experts of the government's giant agro-industrial
complex had determined ``the grain procurements as a whole around
the country will be somewhat lower than the level of the two
previous years.''
   Izvestia said that although it was reporting bad news, it was a
sign of progress in Soviet society that the news about such a
sensitive area of Soviet life could be reported at all.
   Last year's harvest was considered by Western observers to be
good because the growing season was unusually damp and cool.
   Figures for 1986 and 1987 were well above the average for
1981-1985 of about 203.5 million tons but well below official
targets, which Western observers consider unrealistic.
   The 1986 target was 255 million tons, and Soviet officials are
trying to boost that to 275 million tons over several years' time.
   Western experts say the Soviet Union uses about 240-255 million
tons of grain a year and must import what it cannot produce.
   Gorbachev is trying to reform Soviet agriculture by giving
families and small brigades of farm workers more responsibility and
greater security on the huge state and collective farms.
   The Soviet leader hopes to encourage farmers to work harder by
offering them a chance to earn more money and live better.

   ``The planes dropped bombs,'' the Kurdish
survivor said. ``They did not produce a big noise. A yellowish
cloud was created and there was a smell of rotten parsley or
onions. There were no wounds. People would breathe the smoke, then
fall down and blood would come from their mouths.''
   The speaker, one of 200 Kurdish refugees interviewed in Turkey
earlier this month by two members of the staff of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, identified himself as a member of the
Kurdish insurgent forces fighting Iraq's government.
   The staff investigators, Peter W. Galbraith and Christopher Van
Hollen Jr., called the refugee accounts, describing attacks on more
than 30 villages, persuasive and said the symptoms they reported
are ``classically associated with mustard gas poisoning.''
   While acknowledging that some of the witnesses obviously were
biased against Iraq, the two staff members concluded: ``To dismiss
the eyewitness accounts would require one to believe that 65,000
Kurdish refugees confined to five disparate locations were able to
organize a conspiracy in 15 days to defame Iraq and that these
refugees were able to keep their conspiracy a secret not only from
us but from the world press.''
   Kurds, a nomadic Moslem people, have fought unsuccessfully for
years to gain autonomy for their region within Iraq. Kurdistan also
extends into parts of Iran and Turkey.
   Citing the interviews and other evidence, Galbraith and Van
Hollen concluded that ``overwhelming evidence exists'' that Iraq
subjected Kurdish villages to three days of poison gas attacks last
month.
   In a report to Foreign Relations Chairman Claiborne Pell,
D-R.I., they conclude that the attacks were part of a deliberate
policy by Iraq to depopulate the Kurdish regions of the country.
   ``We find no question that Iraq's policy in Kurdistan has the
characteristics of genocide,'' the staff investigators said.
   The House Foreign Affairs Committee, prompted by earlier reports
of Iraqi attacks against the Kurds, is debating legislation to
impose economic sanctions on the Baghdad government. The Senate
already has approved sanctions legislation against Iraq.
   Iraq, earlier accused of using mustard gas against attacking
Iranian soldiers, has denied it employed chemical weapons against
the Kurds or anyone else.
   The Foreign Relations staff report uses dozens of eyewitness
accounts of the alleged chemical attacks against the Kurds to paint
a graphic narrative.
   ``As described by the villagers, the bombs that fell on the
morning of August 25 did not produce a loud explosion,'' the report
said.
   ``Only a weak sound could be heard and then a yellowish cloud
spread out from the center of the explosion and became a thin mist.
The air became mixed with a mixture of smells _ `bad garlic,'
`rotten onions' and `bad apples.''
   ``Those who were very close to the bombs died instantly,'' the
report said. ``Those who did not die instantly found it difficult
to breathe and began to vomit. The gas stung the eyes, skin and
lungs of the villagers exposed to it. Many suffered temporary
blindness.''
   ``After the bombs exploded, many villagers ran and submerged
their faces in nearby streams to escape the spreading gas. Many of
those who made it to the streams survived. Those who could not run
from the growing smell, mostly the very old and the very young,
died.
   ``The survivors who saw the dead reported that blood could be
seen trickling out of the mouths of some of the bodies,'' the
report said. ``A yellowish fluid could also be seen oozing out of
the noses and mouths of some of the dead. Some said the bodies
appeared frozen. Many of the dead bodies turned blackish blue.
   ``Most of the villagers quickly abandoned the contaminated
areas, leaving the bodies unburied in the sun,'' the report said.
``In some cases they later returned to the poisoned villages to
bury the bodies. ...
   ``In every village where chemical bombs were dropped, the
livestock _ mostly donkeys and goats _ died,'' the report said.
``Birds are also reported to have `fallen out of the sky.' Bees in
the area are also said to have been killed by the gas.''
   Galbraith and Von Hollen say the chemical attacks on Kurdish
villages continued on Aug. 26 and Aug. 27 and they concluded that
``no area in the northeastern reaches of Iraqi Kurdistan was safe
from chemical attack.''
   Thousands of Kurds fled across the border into Turkey, but on
Aug. 28 the Iraqi army blocked a road parallel to the border,
trapping Kurdish villagers inside Iraq, the report said.
   ``An Iraqi Kurd who managed to cross the road said, `Whatever
they saw they shot _ children, women, young and old,'' the report
said.
   It said that by Sept. 5 the Iraqi army had set up camps along
the border, slowing the flow of refugees to a trickle.
   ``In at least one village where Kurds remained _ the village of
Baze _ survivors report Iraqi forces opened fire with machine guns
on everyone in the village and then used bulldozers to push the
bodies into mass graves,'' the report stated.

   Pope John Paul II condemned South Africa's
policy of apartheid on Wednesday but also expressed a desire to
visit that country.
   The pope returned Monday from a 10-day trip to Zimbabwe,
Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and Mozambique. He also made a brief,
unscheduled stop in South Africa.
   ``Apartheid remains in clear conflict with human dignity from
the Christian point of view,'' said John Paul, because ``all human
beings enjoy the same dignity that cannot be weakened by belonging
to a race.''
   ``Surmounting discrimination in this field is an integral part
of the program for liberation and self-determination of the African
people,'' he told a general audience.
   The pontiff, whose plane stopped in South Africa because of
stormy weather and mechanical difficulties at the airport in
Lesotho, also said he believes that in the future he will be able
to visit the faithful in such countries as South Africa, Angola,
Namibia, Sao Tome and Principe.
   Some anti-apartheid leaders in South Africa said the pope did
not speak out strongly enough against that nation during his
southern Africa trip. South Africa's system of apartheid gives the
nation's white minority control of the government and denies the 26
million blacks a vote in national affairs.

   Residents of Jefferson tried to go about
business as usual Wednesday despite a fiery reminder that their
small town on the edge of the White Mountains remains under siege
by an arsonist.
   At 10:10 Tuesday night, volunteer firefighters rushed to a
burning unoccupied log cabin _ the 20th suspicious fire in the town
of 900 since early May, but the first since Aug. 23.
   ``It's gone on so long now that people are making the effort to
live each day as it comes, and live their normal lives,'' said
state Sen. Charles Bond, a Jefferson resident.
   ``People had been trying to relax and hope that it is over,''
Bond said. ``There's a feeling of disappointment, I'm sure.''
   The fire extensively damaged the interior of the cabin, which is
about 10 miles from the center of town.
   Most residents have tired of talking about their ordeal and
shrug off questions from reporters. But a phone call to the general
store Wednesday morning revealed that residents were talking among
themselves about the latest fire.
   Except for several cases of smoke inhalation, there have been no
injuries in the house and brush fires. But several families have
been left homeless and townspeople are fearful and angry. Many,
with weapons ready, have taken to keeping watch over their homes
all night.
   The Jefferson Firemen's Association has raised $5,000 for a
reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction.
Firefighters only hope it isn't a neighbor, or a good friend.
   State Fire Marshal William Toland said he has received calls
from current and former firefighting authorities throughout New
England with the names of known arsonists, and the possibility that
one might be living in the Jefferson area.
   ``It takes time to check them all out,'' he said.
   The investigation has progressed, he said, declining to say more.
   Charles King, a national arson expert who spent 23 years with
the New York City Fire Department and has investigated 10,000
fires, expects the fires to continue ``until they catch him. If
he's not scared off by now, it's kind of a `try and catch me'
thing,'' he said.
   ``When you have multiple fires, and have no leads, the person
who is setting the fires has to continue setting them for you to
catch them.''
   New Hampshire authorities have ``just got to get lucky. They
have a monster,'' he said.
   Bond and King point to the surrounding wilderness and sparse
population as impediments to catching the arsonist with match in
hand.
   There is no realistic way to patrol the area, Bond said of the
town's 100 square miles.
   ``There are so many areas where they can do what they do and
just melt into the woods,'' King said. ``How can you patrol the
area around Jefferson?''
   In New York City, the population is more dense and there are
more sources of information, King said. ``In the city, there's
always that little old lady who sits up all night and sees
everything.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Reagan Pictured as Great Friend of United
Nations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan, a sharp critic of the United
Nations during much of his administration, is being pictured by his
aides as one of the world body's stoutest champions as he prepares
to say his U.N. farewells.
   Reagan will make what is expected to be his final appearance
before the international forum in a visit Monday and Tuesday for
the opening of the annual General Assembly session in New York.
   Aides say he will deliver a major speech that may outline new
proposals designed to deal with world trouble spots.
   It will be his sixth speech to a regular U.N. session, or his
seventh counting a 1982 appearance at a special session on
disarmament.
   It has been heralded with unaccustomed hoopla _ a press briefing
on Tuesday by Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne Ridgeway and
another one on Wednesday by Reagan's national security adviser,
Colin L. Powell.
   ``Well, it's an important two-day event, and we know you'd like
to have as many briefings as possible,'' White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater explained.
   Powell told reporters that Reagan's involvement in General
Assembly activities has been ``unprecedented for an American
president.''
   ``As a result of the president's involvement, I think it is fair
to say that our relations with the United Nations are excellent,
better than they have been for a long time,'' the national security
adviser said.
   In his previous appearances, however, Reagan often had
criticized the U.N., calling for reforms in its budgetary and
hiring practices.
   On Sept. 13, the White House announced that Reagan would release
$188 million that the United States had withheld from the U.N.
because of U.S. misgivings about the way the organization was run.
The president also said he would seek full funding for the next
fiscal year.
   Powell said these payments have begun.
   The national security adviser also said, however, that more than
just budget reform is involved in the president's new warmth toward
the international organization.
   ``The United Nations has started to play a more important role
around the world in helping to deal with regional conflicts,'' he
said. ``They are really doing what we always hoped they would do.''
   Powell said the president's address Monday would be ``a major
foreign policy speech, broad in scope. ... It will be forward
looking even as it reflects on past accomplishments.''
   ``We have a couple of new initiatives under consideration ... to
help deal with some of the regional conflict issues around the
world,'' he added.
   He also said he expects that the issue of chemical warfare will
come up in some of Reagan's discussions with foreign leaders and
that the issue might also be covered in the speech.
   On Monday night, Reagan will be host at a reception for heads of
state and other dignitaries.
   ``It will be sort of a farewell to U.N. members,'' Powell said.
   ``His criticism has produced results,'' he said, ``and he is
acknowledging that there have been results. He's essentially taking
a snapshot, in what he has done last week and the speech, of where
the U.N. is now and where the U.N. can go in the future.''

   Authorities executed a Canton man convicted of
robbing tourists including a visitor from Japan who was forced to
surrender a camera and $820 in yen, a newspaper reported today.
   The China Daily said the Canton City Intermediate People's Court
condemned to death Li Zhaoheng, who was executed Tuesday, and
handed down life sentences to an accomplice for multiple armed
robberies in the city's Yuexiu Park in August and September of last
year.
   A third man was sentenced to seven years in prison. The ages and
professions of the three men were not given.
   Among the victims, it said, was a Japanese tourist robbed of
110,000 Japanese yen ($820, a camera and his passport, and a
Chinese man who was stabbed in the chest and stomach.
   The daily said the robbers were armed with a dagger.
   China usually metes out harsh punishment for crimes in which
foreigners are victimized, and there have been several cases of the
death sentence being given to Chinese who attack or rob foreigners.
   Execution is normally by a bullet to the back of the head.

<TEXT>
   Actress Christine Norden, a one-time British sex
symbol who was the first performer to appear topless in a Broadway
play, died Wednesday at age 63, her agent said.
   Vincent Shaw said Miss Norden died at West Middlesex Hospital
following a heart attack that came two months after a double
heart-bypass operation in July.
   Miss Norden, born Molly Thornton in the northern England town of
Sunderland, began her career in the 1940s under contract to London
Films and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.
   Her films included ``Night Beat,'' ``Mine Own Executioner,''
``Idol of Paris'' and ``Reluctant Heroes'' before she moved to New
York in 1953.
   She made her Broadway debut in 1960 in the musical
``Tenderloin'' and later made headlines by being the first Broadway
actress to appear on-stage topless in the 1967 comedy ``Scuba
Duba,'' which also starred Jerry Orbach.
   She last appeared on the British stage in a 1979 revival of
``The Marriage Go Round,'' and had a small role in the 1986 movie
musical ``Little Shop of Horrors.''
   She is survived by her fifth husband, George Heselden, a
scientist for the Ministry of Defense.

   At age 70, news commentator Paul Harvey is about
to become a museum piece, but he isn't letting that interfere with
his three daily radio shows, his newspaper column or his speaking
tours.
   ``Tomorrow's the most exciting day in world to me,'' Harvey said
recently, and he has plenty of tomorrows planned _ new directions
for his syndicated television program, a new second home and studio
in Phoenix and adding a helicopter rating to his aviation licenses.
   On Saturday, he is to be inducted into Chicago's Museum of
Broadcast Communications.
   ``I won't retire until I find something that's more fun to do,''
Harvey said, gesturing around his office-studio, decorated with
civic awards, keys to cities and cartoons.
   Harvey got his start at 15 with radio station KVOO in his native
Tulsa, Okla. His name was Paul H. Aurandt back then, and it
remained so through stints in Kansas, St. Louis and Kalamazoo,
Mich. He changed it on taking his first Chicago job in 1944.
   Now, when he says ``Good morning, Americans, this is Paul
Harvey,'' he speaks to an estimated 22 million listeners on 1,348
radio stations, but Harvey tries to concentrate on one person.
   ``I'm usually talking to my wife's sister,'' Harvey said. ``She
seems to epitomize grass-roots America to me. I keep asking myself,
`Would Aunt Betty really care? Would Aunt Betty really understand?'
A lot of stories get rewritten or discarded because of that.''
   Harvey shrugs off such adjectives as ``cornball'' and criticism
of his format, in which ominous headlines are often juxtaposed with
cute animal stories and Harvey's comments.
   ``Hard, cold facts have to be made palatable with some leavening
_ but you can't use too much of that leavening. No one wants to
listen to just good news, after all _ it's been tried and it
doesn't work.''
   He also does his own commercials, delivering them in the same
tone of voice as the news itself. The practice is a Harvey
trademark _ and he defends it, saying, ``I use the products myself
and I can vouch for them.''
   Interviewer and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Studs Terkel, who
has been on Chicago radio since 1945, says he understands Harvey's
popularity, but does not necessarily approve of the reasons.
   ``At a certain point in the New Deal and a certain point in the
war, Paul said the usual, expected things,'' Terkel said. ``Paul
was offering pretty simplistic views, and they caught on like a
house afire, I guess they were what some people wanted to hear.''
   ``He's a nice guy, a very honest guy and a very fair-minded
guy,'' said Terkel. ``I like him very much personally, but I don't
have much in common with his views. In some ways, he's confined his
mind to the 12th century _ and it's not the 12th century anymore.
He sees things in blacks and whites, and the world is more complex
than he realizes.''
   Harvey's family _ he and wife Lynne have been married 47 years _
has sometimes influenced his broadcasts, as when he reversed
himself on the Vietnam War. He signaled the shift in a broadcast
that opened: ``I love you, Mr. President, but you're wrong ...''
   ``I changed my mind about Vietnam after a painful period of
several months of soul-searching and discussions _ often around our
own dinner table,'' he said. ``My son, Paul Jr., was exempt, but he
felt so strongly about the war that he chose to announce himself as
a conscientious objector anyway.''
   It was the Cold War that brought Harvey to national prominence.
Working as an ABC radio commentator in 1951, he was arrested on
orders of the Atomic Energy Commission for scaling a fence and
surreptitiously entering Argonne National Laboratory, west of
Chicago.
   Harvey said it was investigative journalism and proved that
security was lax at the AEC's nuclear facilities; the AEC called it
breaking and entering.
   ``No indictment was filed, but Harry Truman had me picking
barbed wire out of my britches for about a decade,'' Harvey
recalled.
   Having supported such political opposites as Sens. Joseph
McCarthy and William Fulbright, Harvey says he once considered
himself a conservative but can no longer define himself politically.
   ``Basically, I believe in Big People, as opposed to Big
Government _ to the extent that a sardine society will allow,'' he
said.

   The political season got into full swing this
week, but it was starkly clear that the center cannot hold.
   Three years after outstripping Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
in opinion polls and promising to break the mold of British
politics, the two center parties have been shunted to the sidelines.
   Britain once again appears to be a two-party state _ the
governing Conservatives, who are to meet Oct. 11-14, and the
opposition Labor Party, whose convention is Oct. 2-7.
   The Social Democratic Party, led David Owen, who is often rated
the most formidable politician in Britain after Mrs. Thatcher,
ended its four-day convention Tuesday just barely alive.
   The newly-formed Social and Liberal Democratic Party is not in
much better condition before its meeting Sept. 24-29 in the seaside
resort of Blackpool.
   The party, a merger of Social Democrats and Liberals, once
looked like it could turn British politics into a three-way race.
The alliance polled 22.5 percent of the vote in the last general
election in June 1987.
   Today, the two parties are fighting their political battles
separately and can't reach even double digits in popular support.
Recent polls show only 9 percent support for the Social and Liberal
Democrats and 4 percent for the Social Democrats.
   The former political allies have become victims of unkind jokes
and public indifference. Most analysts believe their main
significance lies in their capacity to snatch just enough votes
from Labor to ensure Mrs. Thatcher an unprecedented fourth
consecutive term in the next election.
   The Social Democratic Party has only three members in
Parliament. Except for Owen, a national figure with a big following
in his district of Plymouth, the legislators may well lose their
seats in the next elections.
   ``Perhaps (Owen will) reflect ... on the hopes thrown away and
the opportunities bungled,'' lamented the liberal Guardian
newspaper.
   Owen, 50, the former foreign secretary once tipped for the
premiership, rallied only a handful of loyalists to debate
apartheid, nuclear weapons and British shopping hours at the party
convention this week in Torquay, a south England coastal resort.
   Three years ago the British Broadcasting Corp. gave Owens' party
conference full and live television coverage, just like the
Conservative, Labor and Liberal party conferences. The atmosphere
was heady.
   This year, the trappings remained _ cameras, reporters, agendas,
resolutions _ but the BBC covered less than half the proceedings
and delayed screening Owen's keynote address because it clashed
with the Olympics.
   ``(The centrist parties) don't speak to a clear constituency and
their support has generally been negative _ from people who don't
like the Tories or don't like Labor rather than having any clear
perception of what the center's policies are,'' political analyst
Peter Keliner said in an interview.
   In most other West European countries, center parties thrive,
often in coalition governments under electoral systems that
allocate parliamentary seats according to the percentage of the
vote won. In Britain, a legislator wins only when he wins his
district.
   ``Fundamentally, the British electoral system operates against
center parties,'' Kellner said.
   Owen appealed in vain to the Labor Party for a new voting system
less harsh on small parties.
   ``Does the Labor Party go on vainly pretending that they can
challenge and beat the Conservatives outright?'' he asked.
   The Social and Liberal Democratic Party controls 19 seats in the
650-member House of Commons, compared with the Conservatives' 374
and Labor's 228.
   The experiment in centrist politics began in 1981, when
disenchanted Laborites broke away to form the Social Democratic
Party. The same year, the new party formed an alliance with the
Liberals, a party started in 1828 that once governed the country
but was reduced to a minority.
   In the 1983 election, the two-party alliance made an impressive
debut, capturing one-fourth of the vote. Four years later, its
share of the vote fell. The alliance promptly split after its
Liberal co-leader, David Steel, demanded a formal merger, arguing
that a two-headed party had no chance.
   The merger, which resulted in the Social and Liberal Democratic
Party, was finalized in March 1988 after months of political
infighting.
   Owen has remained with what is left of the original Social
Democratic Party and Steel retired and was succeeded by Paddy
Ashdown, a Liberal legislator.
   ``Today, as a result, we see Dr. Owen, a leader without a party
worth the name (and) the Social and Liberal Democrats, a party
devoid of leaders worth the name,'' commented Peter Jenkins,
columnist in the London newspaper, the Independent.

<HEAD>Report Says CIA Allowed Chopper Smuggling by North Korea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The CIA let North Korean agents smuggle
high-performance Hughes helicopters out of the United States and
withheld the information from law enforcement officials for nearly
a year, according to an NBC News report.
   The agency was aware during the operation that shipments of the
aircraft were being made through a West German trucking company
between 1983 and 1985, NBC said Wednesday.
   Authorities told NBC the trucking company had been bugged, and
the CIA had listened to North Korean agents plan details of the
smuggling operation.
   The CIA believed its source of information was so sensitive that
passing on details to law enforcement agencies might compromise CIA
agents in Germany, NBC reported.
   CIA spokesman William Devine told The Associated Press the
agency had no comment on the NBC report. ``We neither confirm nor
deny the report,'' he said.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci told NBC: ``This is the kind
of thing we've got to stop. Very damaging, no question.''
   The North Koreans protected their investment by obtaining a
Lloyd's of London insurance policy against confiscation of the
helicopters, according to the report. NBC said it obtained a copy
of the policy which contained details of the smuggling routes from
Los Angeles to North Korea. The choppers took a circuitous route
that included stops in Belgium, the Netherlands and Hong Kong.
   Authorities in California discovered the smuggling operation and
seized the last shipment of 15 helicopters in 1985, but Dave
Peters, the lead U.S. Customs agent on the case, told NBC: ``Had
different information been passed along, perhaps these shipments
could have been stopped.''
   The helicopters were Hughes 500E models, commercial versions of
the choppers used by U.S. forces to raid an Iranian ship caught
laying mines in the Persian Gulf. The United States supplies the
South Korean army the same kind of helicopters to defend itself
against North Korea.
   Last Feb. 10, two brothers from Southern California pleaded
guilty to charges in connection with illegally diverting aircraft
to a communist country.
   ``The evidence at trial was that these two defendants knew from
the beginning that these helicopters were going to North Korea,
that they secretly owned the West German company that did the deal
and that they hid the profits in Swiss bank accounts,'' Assistant
U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Modisett said when the men were sentenced in
U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.
   Ronald Semler of Malibu was sentenced to pay a $40,000 fine and
serve three years in federal prison. His brother, Barry Semler of
Santa Barbara, was fined $40,000 and sentenced to one year in
prison.

<HEAD>New Education Secretary Says He'll Fight To Lower Dropout Rate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos may have
only four months on the job, but he says he'll use the time to
fight the dropout rate and advocate education for all.
   The first Hispanic member of a president's Cabinet, Cavazos said
he is concerned about keeping all students in school, and points to
a Hispanic dropout rate of about 30 percent.
   ``We can't afford to lose that many people,'' Cavazos told a
news conference Wednesday, his first day on the job, as he answered
questions in Spanish.
   Cavazos said his mission would be to ``get out there ... and
really have people understand the seriousness of the issue. We've
got to start now. We can't delay. We've waited too long.''
   To get his message across, Cavazos said he would meet with local
officials, professional education societies, and members of
Congress.
   ``The next few months will give us the forum to talk about the
issues that are vital to America,'' he said. ``How do we position
this country, this nation, to really be competitive at the turn of
the century ... and I don't just mean economically.
   ``Rather, let us look to make sure every person in America today
is educated to his or her full potential. My interest is to awaken
America to recall that our strength really has come because we had
an educated electorate,'' Cavazos said.
   Cavazos was confirmed by the Senate and sworn in Tuesday by Vice
President Bush. On Wednesday, Cavazos said he had ``struck
absolutely no deal'' with the Republican presidential nominee to
remain in office if Bush wins the November election.
   ``We never even discussed the possibility of my staying beyond
the January date,'' said Cavazos, who is taking a leave of absence
from his job as president of Texas Tech University and its medical
school.
   But some Republicans have said they wouldn't mind seeing Cavazos
in the next administration, and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah told
fellow Republicans last week that Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
leaned over to him at the end of Cavazos' confirmation hearing and
said that if Michael Dukakis is elected ``I'm going to talk him
into keeping him on as secretary of education.''
   Kennedy told the Senate on Wednesday that Cavazos ``has the
perspective to be a superb secretary of education.''

<HEAD>Consumer Group Seeks Federal Investigation of TWA</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A consumer group is asking the Transportation
Department to investigate the fitness of Trans World Airlines
because of a series of impending financial transactions critics say
threaten the carrier's financial health.
   The petition by the Consumer Federation of America maintains
that plans to convert TWA into a private company would saddle the
airline with $2.3 billion in debt and declining assets because more
than $700 million in TWA's cash could be used in the transaction.
   TWA Chairman Carl Icahn earlier this month won investor support
for the stock deal which would allow Icahn to recover his $440
million investment and control 90 percent of TWA's stock through a
new holding company. Icahn now owns about 77 percent of the airline.
   The petition filed by the consumer group claims TWA could be put
``on the brink of bankruptcy'' by the transaction, which also has
been denounced by TWA's unions.
   A suit filed by the Air Line Pilots Association in the New York
Supreme Court asks that the court prevent Icahn ``from looting
TWA'' through the stock transaction plan. It maintains that Icahn
will ``strip TWA of $665 million'' and threaten the airline's
economic future.
   The Consumer Federation told the department that air travelers
holding nearly $500 million in advance and unused tickets as well
as credits on TWA frequent flyer programs stand to loose
substantial amounts should TWA go bankrupt or be forced to cut
service or routes.
   The federation alleged that Icahn, who purchased TWA in 1985
when it was near collapse, has run up large debts at the company
while holding on to large amounts of cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities. But the petition alleges most of those cash
assets will be wiped out in the stock transaction.
   ``The precarious financial structure after this (transaction)
raises serious questions about whether the airline will be able to
meet its financial and quality of service obligations to the
public,'' said Mark Cooper, director of research for the Consumer
Federation.
   ``After running up huge amounts of debt, the Icahn-led group now
proposes to take all its money and then some out of TWA, leave the
company with absolutely no equity and leave the airline on the
brink of bankruptcy,'' he continued.
   Furthermore, the federation maintained that consumers are
``virtual captives of TWA'' because of its domination in several
cities, such as St. Louis, where more than 80 percent of all
flights are operated by TWA.
   ``The failure of the airline or a significant reduction in
service would have a devastating impact on these consumers who have
few alternatives for air travel,'' said Cooper
   TWA officials in St. Louis and New York did not immediately
return calls seeking comment Wednesday.
   Earlier this week the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, found that TWA had achieved dominant
control of airport traffic in and out of St. Louis since it
acquired Ozark Air Lines two years ago. Ozark had been TWA's
biggest competitor at St. Louis.
   Bill Mosely, a Transportation Department spokesman, said the
petition was still being reviewed. ``We are expecting some decision
fairly soon,'' he said.
   Earlier this year the department launched an in-depth
examination of Texas Air Corp., the holding company of Eastern
Airlines and Continental Airlines, after questions were raised
about the company's financial dealings. No irregularities were
found at Texas Air.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary is performing a delicate
balancing act between East and West as it opens its doors to the
business and technology of the capitalist world.
   Communist Party chief Karoly Grosz has extended a diplomatic
hand to many nations the rest of the Eastern Europe keeps at a
distance.
   Hungary is the first East bloc nation that is to normalize
diplomatic ties with South Korea. The announcement was made in
Seoul on Sept. 13, but no date has been set.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Istvan Komoroczki said the move was
``in harmony with a Hungarian drive to openness to the world,
irrespective of social systems.
   In the same week, Budapest also became the first Eastern bloc
nation to agree to resume diplomatic ties with Israel, severed
after the 1967 Middle East war. After a private visit to Budapest
Sept. 14-15, Israeli Premier Yitzhak Shamir, the first Israeli head
of goverment to visit Hungary, said Israel would renew full
diplomatic ties with Hungary ``in the near future.'' No date was
set.
   Grosz became party boss in May and immediately embarked on a
series of trips to the West, including visits to the United States,
Canada and Britain. The communist leader has emphasized Hungary's
need for Western technology and investments that would reverse its
economic slump and allow it to begin chipping at an $18 billion
foreign debt.
   ``I hardly think I have to reiterate the importance to the life
and development of this country of mutually advantageous external
economic relations,'' Grosz told the English-language official
Daily News last week.
   After being named Hungary's premier in June 1987, Grosz also
visited West Germany in October of that year and Greece in November.
   But the Communist Party leader has been careful not to neglect
or antagonize his Soviet bloc allies as he opens his country to
capitalitstic influences, unlike Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu,
whose maverick policies won him Western support in the 1970s but
irritated Moscow.
   In a balancing move, Grosz made a quick visit to Moscow before
his 10-day U.S. tour in July, apparently to win Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev's support for his overtures toward the West.
   While visiting East Germany in September, Grosz emphasized the
need to boost economic relations between the two countries,
although East Berlin has balked at Gorbachev's proposed reforms.
   Budapest also has refrained from criticizing Czechoslovakia,
although Hungarian activists oppose a joint hydroelectric project
on the Danube River that links them.
   When relations between Romania and Hungary hit an all-time low
this summer in the wake of Bucharest's alleged discrimination
against its 1.7 million minority Hungarians, Grosz met with
Ceausescu in Romania on Aug. 28.
   The Hungarian leader drew criticism at home for his failure to
persuade the Romanian government to scrap its plan to raze
thousands of villages inhabited by the Hungarian minority.
   A Western analyst in Budapest, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Hungary, with its good human rights record and
liberal policies, has presented itself to the West as
``user-friendly.''
   At the same time, Budapest seems to have Moscow's approval in
pursuing whatever foreign policy it chooses _ as long as they don't
damage its ties to the Warsaw Pact alliance.
   This independence began long before Grosz and Gorbachev, but it
received a boost when the two leaders came to power.
   In 1985, Hungary was the East bloc host of a 35-nation cultural
forum under the Helsinki human rights accords.
   In March 1987, Hungary became the first East bloc country to
join the West in backing a minority rights resolution at the Vienna
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   More recently, Budapest was the site Aug. 30-31 of a closed-door
meeting of arms experts from NATO and the Warsaw Pact, and it has
offered to host a Soviet-U.S. summit.
   Hungary's joint bid with Austria to host the 1995 World's Fair
in Vienna and Budapest has strengthened the impression that Hungary
is seeking a role similar to that of neutral Austria, a center of
East-West contacts.

<HEAD>Delta Crash Investigations Study Tapes for Sound of Flap Settings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators of last month's Delta Air Lines
crash in Texas are trying to determine whether several ``click''
sounds on the jet's cockpit voice recorder are indications the
flight crew set the flaps before takeoff.
   The Boeing 727 crashed seconds after taking off from the
Dallas-Fort Worth airport Aug. 31, killing 14 of the 108 people
aboard. The investigation has focused on whether a false flap
setting may have kept the plane from gaining altitude.
   At least two clicks can be heard on the recording, according to
sources close to the investigation. But additional sounds also are
being studied to determine the exact number of clicks and whether
they relate directly to the flaps' position.
   The flaps, which provide an aircraft with lift during takeoff,
were supposed to have been set at 15 degrees for proper takeoff of
Flight 1141.
   The Dallas Morning News on Wednesday quoted National
Transportation Safety Board officials it did not name as saying
they were studying the possibility that the flaps were extended,
but not far enough.
   ``What you hear (on the tape of the cockpit conversation) are
two `clicks' in quick succession. That means that the flaps were at
least at the 5-degree setting,'' the newspaper quoted one source as
saying.
   The Boeing 727 has flap settings of 2, 5 and 15 degrees. The
flap control mechanism in the cockpit has notches that produce
clicking sounds as the lever is moved.
   Meanwhile, investigators are expected to conduct tests in flight
simulators to determine what minimum flap setting would have been
required for the plane to gain proper lift.
   Some aviation experts who have followed the accident
investigation say the Boeing 727, which was not fully loaded,
should have been able to take off even with a lower than optimum
flap setting.
   Drucella Anderson, a spokeswoman for the NTSB, said Wednesday
the safety board would have no comment on what investigators are
examining on the cockpit voice recorder tapes.
   Investigators have uncovered conflicting evidence as to the
jet's flap setting at the time of takeoff.
   The voice recorder shows the co-pilot acknowledged having set
the flaps to 15 degrees during the routine preflight checklist.
   ``Fifteen, fifteen, green,'' the co-pilot was heard to say on
the cockpit recorder tape, according to sources involved in the
investigation.
   One source suggested that the co-pilot, if he set the flaps,
probably did so earlier and was reading off the flap setting at the
time his response was recorded.
   The reference to ``green'' refers to a light showing the
position of separate control surfaces on the forward edge of the
wings called slats. A green light shows them to be in the extended
position.
   Slats also are supposed to be extended during takeoff, but
investigators have said they found the slats on the wrecked
aircraft in an unlocked but retracted position.
   Investigators have said the jack screws on the wings also
indicated the flaps were in a retracted position and the flap-slat
control lever in the cockpit was found in an up position,
indicating the flaps were retracted. The co-pilot who was
responsible for setting the flaps has told investigators he cannot
remember anything after the aircraft was pushed back from the gates.

   As Republican Sen. Chic Hecht struggles
to hold his seat against a strong challenge from Democratic Gov.
Dick Bryan, their battle has turned bitter with party and campaign
officials making accusations on usually-untouchable subjects such
as Bryan's sex life and Hecht's intelligence.
   On the surface, Bryan and Hecht have been debating one another
on familiar themes _ a possible nuclear dump in Nevada, defense
spending, conservative vs. liberal philosophies and balanced
budgets.
   Hecht, 59, has sought to link Bryan to organized labor in this
state of legalized gambling as well as tie the Democrat to the
liberal views of presidential nominee Michael Dukakis. He also has
accused Bryan of deserting voters who elected him to a second
four-year term as governor in 1986.
   In turn, Bryan, 51, has attacked Hecht for flip-flops on the
nuclear waste dump, for voting against Social Security increases,
and for being generally ineffective. He also points to poll after
poll showing him with a comfortable lead over the one-term
incumbent.
   And both have been publicly critical of another level of the
campaign in which top party officials and key campaign staffers
have accused one another of ``dirty tricks.''
   Bryan blasted Clark County Republican Chairman Charles Ivy for
``a despicable campaign tactic'' in mentioning on a radio talk show
that there have been rumors about Bryan's ``little extramarital
hobbies'' since he was first elected to the state Assembly in 1968.
   ``This kind of crap kind of discourages people from putting
their names on the line,'' said Bryan, adding that there is no
truth to the rumors of infidelity and he would consider legal
action after the election.
   Hecht insisted his campaign staff had nothing to do with the
comment, and any staffer would be fired immediately if involved.
   Hecht also has complained about recent news accounts citing his
verbal miscues, including a reference to a nuclear repository that
unintentionally came out as ``nuclear suppository.'' He also noted
the opposition's references to Hecht's recent ranking by Senate
administrative assistants as the least effective member of the
Senate.
   Hecht, a Las Vegas businessman, upset Sen. Howard Cannon in 1982
after the incumbent was bloodied during a tough primary fight.
Cannon had to fight mob shadows after he was named in the
indictment of then Teamsters president Roy Lee Williams and mob
figure Allen Dorfman. He testified at length in their trial just a
month before the election.
   Bryan campaign chief Sam Singer describes the Hecht campaign as
``Watergate-style politics the likes of which this state has never
seen,'' and blames Hecht campaign chief Ken Rietz for the ``dirty
tricks.''
   Rietz responds that Singer's attack ``is a little bit like the
pot calling the kettle black,'' adding that the Bryan camp
criticized him for political low blows ``and now they're
distributing information on me.''
   Singer circulated a stack of news clips linking Rietz to
political espionage during the Watergate era and quoting
then-Republican National Chairman George Bush, now the GOP
presidential nominee, as saying in 1973 he wanted none of the
people involved in the activity ever working on GOP campaigns again.
   Rietz said Bush wasn't referring to him but rather was talking
about those convicted in the Watergate scandal. ``That didn't
include me. I was not charged with anything during Watergate,'' he
said. ``I've been working in Republican campaigns ever since then.''
   Singer said the Hecht campaign has shown ``a series of dirty
tricks'' that began with a Rietz employee or ex-employee trying to
dig up information on Democratic Lt. Gov. Bob Miller, who would
take over Bryan's job as governor should Bryan defeat Hecht.
   Singer said that was followed by claims by Ivy that Bryan had
engaged in extramarital affairs, misstatements and misleading
advertisements, and what appeared to be a planted story about Lt.
Gov. Miller's ties to a casino executive convicted of skimming.
   ``There are dirty fingerprints everywhere,'' said Singer.
``Nevada's gaming industry has a black book (of unsavory types
excluded from clubs) and if Nevada politics had a black book
Senator Hecht's campaign would be in it.''

   George Bush's press secretary says the
campaign is not interested in anything that would ``garble our
message,'' and that includes cluttering it up with questions from
the news media.
   So the Republican presidential campaign is wending its way
toward the November election with an eye toward maximizing canned
events that look good on television and minimizing contact with
reporters who might ask questions that are not on the Bush agenda.
   Bush's Democratic rival, Michael Dukakis, has tried to take a
page from the same strategy playbook but so far with less success
as his TV shots often find his back to the cameras.
   Even his recent celebrated tank ride, aimed at projecting
himself as strong on defense and widely photographed, turned out to
be a flop at convincing viewers, a poll showed.
   Still, both candidates are engaged in an election game plan that
keeps reporters at a distance so as not to detract from their
state-of-the-art visual events that they wrap around their campaign
message of the day.
   Bush press secretary Sheila Tate said the idea is that the
campaign is trying to communicate with voters and, ``We're not
going to purposely garble our message by everyday discussing'' what
reporters put forth as an ``agenda as opposed to our own.''
   Thus when Bush recently went to New Jersey to appeal to Hispanic
and blue-collar voters, the traveling press was ushered into the
Goya food plant to watch him sample Hispanic foods.
   Although the reporters were stationed only a few feet from him,
Bush waved off their questions because he was engaged in ``food
tasting'' at the moment. ``We gotta get the message out,'' he said.
   The orchestrated days with little opportunity to question or
challenge the candidates on topical issues has engendered
frustration among the press corps whose job it is to cover the
campaigns. Some TV and print journalists have begun including
regular statements in their Bush stories such as, ``Bush as usual
refused to respond to any questions.''
   The Bush campaign generally is keeping the candidate so far from
reporters that ``We're even out of shouting distance now,'' said
USA Today reporter Jessica Lee.
   Reporter Ellen Warren of Knight-Ridder has taken to wearing a
monocular _ a field glass with a single eyepiece _ so that she can
observe Bush from her far-away press perch.
   Dukakis remains more accessible than Bush, but the access is
generally at late-night airport arrivals when most media deadlines
are already past.
   Both candidates occasionally chat on the record with reporters
flying with them. But most reporters agree that these casual
sessions do not lend themselves to the more probing
question-and-answer typical of a more formal news conference, and
the candidates tend to close it off when the questions take on that
tone.
   Dukakis has an average of one or two news conferences a week,
considerably less than before a campaign survey found his TV
coverage was centering not on his tailor-made message but on his
responses to reporters' questions about Bush's latest allegations.
   Since Bush was nominated in mid-August, his scheduled
question-and-answer sessions with reporters have dwindled to an
average of one a week, and chances to shout questions at airports
and rope lines are significantly fewer.
   Campaign officials don't deny the hold-the-press-at-bay strategy.
   ``In these last weeks of the campaign we have to have a clear
message,'' said Tate. ``It is important to us that we set the
agenda. We have a need to be responsive to the press. We also have
a need to run a successful campaign. The only way to do that is to
get your message out and your agenda.''
   Senior Dukakis aide Kirk O'Donnell recently complained that the
TV networks weren't covering Dukakis' speeches, and said the
campaign would alter its media strategy to get on the networks.
   Bush's advance team diligently escorts camera crews around
factories and behind podiums for the best shots of the GOP nominee.
   The results are picture-perfect TV, a series of events where
Bush has stood amid waving American flags, has spoken against the
backdrop of majestic columns on Capitol steps and been flanked by
colorful school bands, cheerleaders and choirs.
   The Dukakis visuals are improving since the media adviser
Francis O'Brien began traveling with the candidate two weeks ago.
   But the Democrat has had a string of events where cameras saw
only the back of his head or where the lighting obliterated what
should have been a good shot.
   That was the case when he went to Yellowstone National Park to
stand before a blackened forest. The singed background was so dark
it was impossible to tell what it was.
   Another time Dukakis lined up a group of teen-agers on a San
Francisco beach to talk to them about the environment. The students
faced the cameras, while Dukakis was positioned on the sand in
front of them _ his back to the cameras.

<HEAD>Report Says Former Politburo Member Cheated to Skip Military
Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Politburo member Geidar Aliev ducked
military service in World War II and later covered up his scheme
with phony records saying he was a veteran, a newspaper reported.
   A lengthy article in Wednesday's editions of the weekly
Literaturnaya Gazeta accused Aliev, the former Communist Party boss
of Azerbaijan and a close associate of the late Soviet leader
Leonid I. Brezhnev, of rampant corruption.
   Aliev, Brezhnev's last appointment to the ruling Politburo
before he died in 1982, worked for many years in the Azerbaijan KGB
secret police.
   Aliev, 65, was dropped from the Politburo on Oct. 21, 1987,
ostensibly for health reasons. But there were suggestions that he
was tainted with corruption in his association with Brezhnev, now
widely criticized for permitting corruption and stagnation.
   A KGB commission established years ago that when Nazi Germany
attacked the Soviet Union in 1941, the 18-year-old Aliev ``quit his
studies in the industrial institute ... and to avoid being called
into the army went to his motherland, his native town,
Nakhichevan,'' said the article, which was written by lawyer Arkady
Vaksberg. ``There he obtained a document stating that he allegedly
suffered from a severe form of tuberculosis and was freed from
service.''
   He then began work in the archives of the NKVD, the precursor of
the KGB, Vaksberg said.
   After the war, Aliev obtained documents saying he was a war
veteran, the article said.
   Despite the commission's discovery, Aliev's older brother,
Gasan, intervened. Aliev was reprimanded but remained in the
Communist Party and was able to build his career, the article said.
   Vaksberg said a former KGB officer and state prosecutor, Gambai
Mamedov, repeatedly tried to draw the attention of Azerbaijani
officials to widespread corruption and falsification of production
statistics under Aliev. But the lawyer said Mamedov was hounded out
of his job and the republic by officials, who lavished praise on
Aliev in party and government meetings.
   He said that since Aliev's ouster, Mamedov has been able to
return to Baku, the Azerbaijan capital, from Leningrad where he
lived in the apartment of his wife's relatives.

   An American Airlines 727 jetliner was
forced to make an emergency belly landing Wednesday at Dallas-Fort
Worth International Airport when its main landing gear jammed,
officials said.
   Passengers evacuated the aircraft on an emergency slide,
according to John Hotard, a spokesman for the airlines. Hotard said
there was no fire and he knew of only one person who was hurt,
receiving an ankle injury.
   Hotard said Flight 135, carrying 81 passengers and seven crew
members, was due at 9 p.m. from Oklahoma City on a non-stop flight
when the pilot could not get the main landing gear to descend.
   The pilot circled the airport to expend fuel for the emergency
landing, airline officials said, and brought the 150-seat plane in
around 9:40 p.m.
   Airport and Department of Public Safety workers sprayed the
craft with flame-retardant foam. The emergency slides were deployed
and passengers evacuated, Hotard said.

   A naked man ran into St. Patrick's Cathedral on
Wednesday night and attacked people with an iron prayer bookstand,
killing one man and injuring a police officer before being shot to
death by other officers, authorities said.
   That morning, the man attended Mass at the cathedral celebrated
by Cardinal John O'Connor and stood directly before the cardinal as
he administered the eucharist, O'Connor told reporters.
   The man entered the historic midtown church stark naked around 8
p.m. carrying red carnations, repeatedly hit a woman praying in a
pew, walked to a front altar where he ripped the prayer book
stanchion from the floor, and then struck and killed an usher and
wounded a police officer with it, police and witnesses said.
   The man was shot and killed by a backup police unit after he
used the three-foot-long stanchion to attack a police officer who
tried to subdue him, said Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell, a police
spokesman.
   Lt. Al Barrasso, a spokesman for Emergency Medical Service, said
the officer, Jimmy McManus, was taken to Bellevue Hospital with
head and shoulder injuries. He was listed in serious condition.
   The usher, John Winters, died about 50 feet from the altar.
   The woman's injuries were not immediately known. ``She gets up.
I don't think she was that hurt. She runs out of the church,'' said
Thomas Clark, an eyewitness.
   O'Connor said at an evening news conference that the naked man
had stood before him during communion at the morning Mass.
   ``The man came up and stood in front of me,'' he said. ``I felt
he was totally disoriented. The cathedral is a magnet for all
people. People sleep in it and engage in the strangest behavior in
the cathedral. I patted him on the shoulder and said, `God bless
you.' He stood for a moment and left.''
   The cardinal said that the man allegedly had committed acts of
minor vandalism in and around the church in the past.
   Described by O'Connor as ``big'' and ``powerful'' the man was
able to rip the metal stanchion out of the marble floor to which it
was bolted.
   Witness Scott Lucas, 56, said he saw the man tear off his shorts
and white shirt on a street near the church.
   ``He suddenly stopped, stripped, and headed up the street. He
was obviously disturbed,'' Lucas said. ``He was not aware of
anybody else.''
   Lucas said the man was ``chanting under his breath'' from the
time he took off his clothes, which were found at 50th Street and
Rockefeller Plaza.
   A parishioner, Peggy Strassburg, identified the dead church
employee as an usher who was about 75 years old.
   The officer was taken to Bellevue Hospital with head and
shoulder injuries, and was listed in serious condition, Barrasso
said.
   The attacker was shot once in the chest and pronounced dead at
the scene, police said.
   Luis Gonzalez, 18, of Brooklyn, said the man was already in the
middle of the church and approaching the woman when he and his
mother arrived to light some candles for loved ones.
   ``He had a belt in his hand and was hitting her in the back and
all over. He was crazy hitting her with the belt. He must have hit
her more than 10 times.'' Gonzalez said.
   ``Everyone backed away. Then the cops rushed in. She was
screaming very loud that she was getting hit and needed help. But
everyone was running away from her. We ran,'' Gonzalez said.
   ``She was screaming like she was in terrible pain,'' he said.
   The man was lying in the middle aisle of the church after he was
shot, said Thomas Clark, who witnessed the incident.
   ``The police officer was trying to convince him to leave'' when
the man attacked him with a metal stand, Clark said.

<HEAD>Access Roads: A New Battle at Gettysburg</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's the battle of Devil's Den, pitting
tourist convenience against the National Park Service's desire to
curtail traffic through the Gettysburg battlefield.
   The park service has proposed eliminating two access roads, as
well as part of a third, to the historic Devil's Den area of the
Pennsylvania battlefield.
   The idea is to move the battlefield closer to its original
appearance and to halt an erosion problem at Devil's Den, an area
of huge rocks that is a popular tourist spot, National Park Service
spokesman Robert Davidson said Wednesday.
   The debate moved here last week when Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa.,
presented to park service Director William Penn Mott a petition
containing signatures of more than 11,000 people who oppose the
plan.
   Mott has agreed to personally inspect the site as part of a
review of the plan, according to park service spokesman George
Berklacy.
   ``There was a road constructed in about 1904 during a period
when people were visiting on horses and buggies,'' Davidson said.
``Since then, the response to more and larger vehicles has been
more pavement, and we just feel that the time has come to take a
new direction.''
   But the Devil's Den Access Committee brought maps and a slide
show last week to document their concerns to the park service that
the plan would be counterproductive.
   Phil Cole, a battlefield guide who heads the citizen protest,
said Wednesday that he fears people would have to walk to Devil's
Den from a planned new parking lot that may be too small to
accommodate visitors.
   The walk is three-quarters of a mile, round trip.
   ``People are not all joggers or athletic. Plus, there is
inclement weather, and hot days,'' he said.
   Traffic, he said, will be diverted to other roads that will
become more congested.
   An access road would be made available so that the disabled
could be driven to the site, the park service said.
   The Gettysburg National Military Battlefield has been holding
events to mark the 125th anniversary of the bloody Civil War battle
on July 1-3, 1863. Some 50,000 Union and Confederate soldiers were
killed or wounded on the battlefield, later the scene of Abraham
Lincoln's famous Gettysburg Address.

   A nervous airport security dog prompted extra
precautions as Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze arrived
Wednesday night for what could be the last full-dress U.S.-Soviet
talks in Washington during the Reagan administration.
   Shevardnadze landed without incident, however, and was taken to
the Soviet Embassy where he will stay during two days of meetings
with Secretary of State George Shultz and other senior U.S.
officials, ending in a call on President Reagan at the White House
on Friday.
   The Soviet Aeroflot jetliner carrying Shevardnadze from New York
was parked more distant than usual from terminal buildings and news
media facilities at Andrews Air Force Base, outside Washington,
because a dog used to sniff and detect explosives became nervous,
said a State Department official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   But it proved to be just a precaution and no explosives were
found, the official said.
   A motorcade carried Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead,
Assistant Secretary Rozanne Ridgway and other welcoming officials
from the State Department and Soviet Embassy to planeside while
camera crews assigned to photograph the arrival were left at their
usual position at least 250 feet away.
   Shevardnadze, making no arrival statement, left the airport
immediately.
   By State Department count, his negotiations with Shultz on arms
control, human rights, U.S.-Soviet and regional issues will be
their 28th meeting.
   They are expected to meet again at U.N. headquarters in New York
next week and possibly in Europe if there is a breakthrough on
human rights and other issues before the current review session at
Vienna, Austria, of the 1975 Helsinki accords on East-West security
and cooperation.
   But Ms. Ridgway told reporters this week there is no possibility
that the two sides will be able to resolve differences before the
end of the year on their mutual goal of achieving 50 percent cuts
in strategic ballistic missile warheads to enable Reagan to sign
another arms treaty before the end of his presidency.
   Shevardnadze's schedule also includes a separate meeting with
Vice President George Bush, the Republican candidate to succeed
Reagan, arranged at Bush's request, a U.S. official said. Bush's
Democratic rival, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis has not asked
for a meeting with the Soviet minister, the official added.

<HEAD>Hawaii Tourist Industry Gets Unexpected Boost from Hurricane
Gilbert</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Gilbert, which wreaked havoc on
resorts in Mexico and the Caribbean, has given an unexpected boost
to Hawaii's tourist industry during a normally slow month, tourism
officials say.
   Tourists, hearing of the devastation left in Gilbert's wake, are
rearranging travel plans, officials said Wednesday. At least one
company that books trips to Hawaii has employees working overtime
to handle the demand.
   Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays, the leading seller of tour packages
to Hawaii, is receiving 40 percent more phone calls than normal for
this time of year, according to spokesman Ken Phillips. The company
is headquartered in Westlake Village, Calif.
   ``I know that they have required overtime for reservationists,
bringing people back from vacations early, adding as much as
possible to the staff,'' to handle the increased Hawaii business,
Phillips said.
   September is considered a slow period for Hawaii travel,
Phillips said.
   Tom Vericella, vice president for Hawaii travel at American
Express Travel Related Services, agreed that Gilbert is boosting
tourism figures in Hawaii.
   ``Certainly we have seen an increase at our reservations center
in Atlanta,'' he said.
   Gilbert crippled resorts in Jamaica and Mexico's Yucatan
Peninsula, both considered major competitors for Hawaii's tourist
industry. The hurricane is believed to have killed more than 200
people as it swept through the Gulf of Mexico and into the mainland
last week.

the first time the couple has been together since shortly after
their daughter was born 1{ months ago.
   The duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson, left Wednesday and was
scheduled to arrive in Sydney today, three days ahead of Prince
Andrew, the Duke of York, said a Buckhingham Palace spokesman.
   The prince, a Royal Navy lieutenant, is on a Far East tour of

said the spokesman, who was not identified in keeping with British
custom.
   Before beginning their official Sept. 28 to Oct. 7 visit, the
duke and duchess will spend time privately in Sydney, the palace
said. Princess Beatrice, who was born Aug. 8, was left behind in
England with her nanny, the palace said.

   ``When we come to our country home, we really want to be

   Clarence Clemons, saxophonist for Bruce
Springsteen's E Street Band, feels good about his part in the
Amnesty International Human Rights Now! tour, but admits it comes
with some global hassles.
   ``One day we had breakfast in Italy, lunch in Hungary and supper
in Paris. That's how hectic it's been,'' he said during the group's
stop in Los Angeles this week. ``Then you're talking about 250
people going through customs and everyone being on the same plane
four hours at a time. It's like you play, you travel, you play.''
   But the rewards are worth it, he said.
   ``There are people out here waiting to be executed or have been
brutalized. Knowing that makes me feel like my job is really
important.''
   Springsteen, Clemons and the rest of the group started the
global tour in London on Sept. 2 with such entertainers as Sting,
Peter Gabriel, Tracy Chapman, Youssou N'Dour and Joan Baez.
   The tour is aimed at raising awareness about the Declaration of
Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in
1948.

   French composer Jean-Michel Jarre is making
another attempt to bring huge music, fireworks and laser light
shows to the River Thames.
   The shows would be held Oct. 8 and 9 in the Royal Victoria
Docks, part of the east London area of rotting warehouses being
redeveloped into condominiums and high-technology factories.
   The go-ahead must come from the Newham Borough Council, which
withdrew permission for Jarre's sellout Sept. 24 show, fearing the
crowds estimated at 100,000 would create a fire risk and huge
traffic jams.
   Jarre's revised plans, submitted Wednesday, would split the
concert into two performances on a stage floating in the Thames.
   Jarre, who specializes in synthesizer music, has given only
three concerts. His 1986 performance in Houston drew an estimated
1.3 million fans.

   Syndicated columnist Mike Royko, whose
putdown of Indiana in a 1982 column angered Hoosiers, has asked The
Indianapolis News to drop his column as a favor.
   In a letter published in Wednesday's editions of The News, the
Chicago Tribune columnist said he receives letters from Indiana
residents who describe him as ``a boob, a hack or a communist.''
   Royko said the letters do not offend him as much as opening and
reading them wastes his time. He said Tribune Media Services Inc.,
which distributes the column, does not permit him to choose the
newspapers that carry it.
   ``If you grant me this favor, I will be forever grateful and
will never again say anything bad about Hoosiers,'' Royko wrote.
``Except for those who run for vice president,'' he added, a jab at
Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle, an Indiana
native.
   In an editor's note, The News said it would continue to run the
column. ``Our readers obviously read and respond to Mr. Royko's
column,'' it said.
   In the 1982 column, Royko called Indianapolis ``probably the
dullest large city in the U.S.'' and made fun of the Indianapolis
500. ``That big, stupid race and Indiana deserve each other,'' he
wrote.

   Democratic vice presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen is turning his attention from rural health care to
high-technology and trade as he searches for votes on the diverse
West Coast.
   Bentsen arrived in California on Wednesday, carrying from Texas
the Democrats' new health care proposals. He mixed those with
attacks on the Republicans _ especially Dan Quayle _ as he
campaigned in a Sacramento hospital and at a Fresno rally.
   California's 47 electoral votes are the most of any state. Polls
show the tickets in a virtual tie here, and the Democrats hope to
win the state for the first time since 1964.
   The Texas senator planned today to address employees of the
Intel semiconductor company and then travel to Washington state to
visit Scott Paper Co. Washington has 10 electoral votes.
   On Wednesday, Bentsen and his wife, B.A., scrubbed and put on
hospital garb and visited an intensive care ward for newborn babies
at Sutter Memorial Hospital in Sacramento, underscoring Michael
Dukakis' pledge for a program getting pre-natal care to poor women.
   Bentsen said Republicans George Bush and Dan Quayle had
supported the Reagan administration's cuts in medical care
programs, including maternal and child health.
   ``It's easy to vote against something and call yourself a
conservative, but America pays a very heavy price for neglecting
health care for children,'' he said.
   ``A quarter of our children have not received their measles
vaccines,'' he said. ``Dan Quayle voted against it.''
   In Fresno, an agricultural center in the San Joaquin Valley,
Bentsen told a downtown rally ``the agriculture policy of this
administration has been a disaster for the American farmer.''
   He talked about how the nation's drug problems have worsened in
the past eight years. He continued to blast the Republicans for the
record budget deficits. And, he continued to hammer at Bush's
selection of Quayle as his running mate.
   ``We believe that America deserves a vice president to take on
the toughest and most important job in the world if that was
necessary. Do you think the junior senator from Indiana is up to
that job?''
   ``No,'' yelled the crowd.
   The colorful rally included a huge American flag behind Bentsen,
a staging the Democrats have taken up lately to counter George
Bush's flag-waving campaign.
   There were protesters from both the right and the left greeting
Bentsen. Some opposed his position in favor of keeping abortion
legal, others opposed his support of aid to the Contra rebels in
Nicaragua. A couple of people were dressed up in prison uniforms,
delivering the GOP attack on Massachusetts' prison furlough program
under Dukakis.
   Before leaving Texas, Bentsen himself announced the ticket's
rural health care initiative, including a fund to subsidize rural
hospitals in financial trouble.
   The Democratic ticket is trailing the Republicans in Texas,
despite Bentsen's presence, according to recent polls.
   At the rally in Fresno, Bentsen told the 300 supporters how
important their state was to the ticket.
   ``You're the big banana. The big enchilada. Forty-seven
electoral votes,'' he said.

   The Cabinet today temporarily passed the imperial
mantle to Crown Prince Akihito as Japan fretted over the failing
health of Emperor Hirohito, the world's longest reigning monarch.
   Officials of the Imperial Household Agency, which runs palace
affairs, set up booths today around the country and allowed people
to sign their names in books for the emperor.
   Crowds have gathered in front of the Imperial Palace in central
Toyko since Hirohito took to bed with intestinal hemorrhaging four
days ago. Palace officials said today that he remained in serious
but stable condition.
   ``I felt like my grandfather was dying,'' Aya Kitade, a
22-year-old college student, said Wednesday at the palace.
   She came from Kyoto, 230 miles away, after her grandparents
asked her to visit and convey their greetings to the emperor.
   Across Japan, Shinto shrines held services to pray for the
emperor.
   Many older people still hold Hirohito in high regard, but
younger Japanese typically give him little thought. A minority
strongly opposes the imperial system, charging it represents the
strongly centralized state control and militarism that
characterized wartime Japan.
   The United States forced the emperor, who has occupied the
throne since 1926, to publicly renounce his claim to divinity after
World War II. He remains a symbol of Japan without wielding any
real power.
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi said the Cabinet met today
and agreed to put 54-year-old Akihito temporarily in charge of all
imperial duties.
   ``Taking into consideration the emperor's illness and medical
treatment, we have asked the crown prince to temporarily assume
responsibilities,'' Obuchi said in a nationally televised press
conference.
   Government officials said Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno will not
leave for Washington today for talks with Secretary of State George
P. Shultz. They said that in view of ``domestic circumstances,''
they had also postponed upcoming visits to Japan by Prime Minister
Ciriaco De Mita of Italy on Sunday and by Irish leader Charles J.
Haughey on Wednesday.
   One year ago, when Hirohito underwent an intestinal bypass
operation, the prince took charge of all duties for three months.
In December, Hirohito resumed most of his imperial duties.
   The emperor's health problem began late Monday, when he vomited
blood. The hemorraging is related to an inflamed pancreas.
   Palace officials, widely quoted in press reports, said the
emperor on Wednesday requested food and a television to watch his
favorite sport, sumo wrestling. The emperor is known as shy man
especially fond of his work as a published marine biologist.

<HEAD>Son Of Great Train Robber Seeks Royal Pardon For Father</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son of fugitive Ronald Biggs has arrived in
Britain to seek a royal pardon for his father, a member of the gang
that pulled off the notorious Great Train Robbery of 1963.
   Mike Biggs, 14, said upon arriving Wednesday at Heathrow Airport
that he plans to present Queen Elizabeth II with a letter urging
her to suspend the 30-year sentence imposed on his father for his
part in the robbery.
   ``I want to see my father a free man,'' the young Biggs told
reporters after his flight from Brazil, where his father has lived
in exile since 1970.
   ``It is his right. He has lived for the past 25 years as an
honest man. I have lived with him for the past 14 years and know he
is not a thief anymore,'' Biggs said.
   A spokesman for Buckingham Palace, speaking on condition on
anonymity, said it would be ``highly unlikely'' for the queen to
meet the youth. The British monarch is on vacation in Scotland.
   The senior Biggs, 59, took part in the $7-million robbery from
the Glasgow-to-London mail train Aug. 8, 1963. At the time, it was
Britain's largest heist.
   Less than $980,000 was recovered, but most of the 15 gang
members, including Biggs, were caught and sentenced to prison.
   Biggs escaped from London's Wandsworth Jail in July 1965 and
fled to France, where he had plastic surgery on his face, then to
Australia and finally in 1970 to Brazil, which has no extradition
treaty with Britain.
   In 1985, Biggs said his reported $325,000 share of the robbery
was long gone. He said in an interview this year that he supports
himself by selling souvenirs.

   Sen. Dan Quayle is shrugging off a rebuke
from Barry Goldwater about the tenor of the flag-draped Bush
campaign, saying, ``We're talking about the issues.''
   The Republican vice presidential nominee was delivering a
foreign policy address today at the Los Angeles World Affairs
Council before heading home to Washington.
   Goldwater, who retired this year after a long Senate career as
``Mr. Conservative,'' stole the show from the Indiana senator
Wednesday in Phoenix when he delivered his surprise dart at a
Rotary Club luncheon.
   After introducing Quayle, Goldwater reclaimed the microphone.
   ``I forgot something that I had to say, and I hope you take this
kindly. But I want you to go back and tell George Bush to start
talking about the issues, O.K.?'' the 1964 Republican presidential
candidate said.
   Goldwater did not elaborate, but the dig seemed aimed at Bush's
capture-the-flag campaigning, from his constant criticism of
Michael Dukakis for vetoing a 1977 bill to penalize teachers who
refuse to lead the Pledge of Allegiance to his stop Tuesday at a
New Jersey flag factory.
   Goldwater brushed aside reporters' questions afterwards, saying,
``I'm not talking. I want to get the hell outof here.''
   Quayle, before the 400 Rotarians, laughed and said only, ``I
wish Barry would just say what's on his mind.''
   Later, he told reporters in Bakersfield, Calif., ``Barry
Goldwater is my dear friend. We're talking about the issues.''
   Quayle almost crossed paths with his Democratic counterpart,
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, at the airport in Fresno, Calif.,
where their campaign planes were parked 400 yards apart for a
while. They did not meet.
   The final day of summer was an unusual one for the 41-year-old
Quayle, who trekked from Las Vegas to Phoenix to California's San
Joaquin Valley before reuniting with his wife Marilyn, for a
fund-raiser at a posh Los Angeles hotel. A dozen feminists were
waiting there with signs protesting Bush and Quayle's opposition to
abortion.
   He was hounded in two stops in the Phoenix area by Vietnam
veterans, three of them clad in colorful chicken costumes.
   He made a detour to pick up Goldwater at his home, only to get
admonished.
   Arizona's ousted Republican Gov. Evan Mecham showed up to
deliver an unsolicited endorsement of Quayle.
   At California State University-Fresno, he was greeted by
sky-divers, balloons and a phalanx of students chanting
``Bush-Noriega '88!''
   But inside a student union, he got an enthusiastic reception
from 600 students as he denounced Dukakis for opposing the death
penalty and signing a proclamation in February 1985 supporting a
union boycott of table grapes.
   In both Fresno and at a rally before 1,000 people outside the
courthouse in Bakersfield, Quayle lit into Dukakis as ``a
card-carrying member of the ACLU'' and charged he would appoint
judges like Rose Bird, the liberal California Supreme Court Justice
who was recalled in part for opposing the death penalty.
   At Frye Elementary School in Chandler, Ariz., he offered
children a brief civics lesson on free speech after demonstrators
yelled ``Chicken hawk'' at him.
   ``Don't pay any attention to them. You know, in this country of
ours, we have a thing called freedom of speech. ... '' he said.
``They have the freedom of speech, but you know what, kids? So do
we.''

<HEAD>Investor Group Attempts Public Stock Offering to Buy Historic
Brothel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In an unusual meeting of the financial
district and the red light district, an investor group plans a
stock offering to raise money to buy the Mustang Ranch, the
nation's biggest legal bordello.
   The group, led by Reno attorney Peter Perry and real estate
developer Donald Clough, plans to raise $23.3 million through a
stock offering to purchase the famed brothel 10 miles east of here,
Perry said.
   The group filed an application Friday with the Securities and
Exchange Commission to sell 1.165 million common shares of Mustang
Ranch Inc. at $20 a share, Perry said Wednesday.
   This is the second attempted share offering to raise money to
buy the Mustang Ranch. A proposed $18 million sale by another group
fell through in 1985 when it failed to attract enough investor
interest.
   ``We've got everything in motion now and are just waiting to see
what the SEC does,'' said Perry, chief executive of Mustang Ranch
Inc., formed last year to make the transaction.
   Perry, citing SEC rules, declined to discuss details of the deal
or name the other two officers besides Clough who will control more
than 40 percent of the company.
   Documents filed with the SEC indicate $18 million would be used
to buy the 105-room brothel. The remaining funds would cover
capital improvements, financial reserves and administrative costs.
   The ranch's founder and owner, Joe Conforte, announced in July
his plan to retire from the business after roughly 30 years. He
needs the proceeds from the sale to pay back income taxes and
penalties.
   ``I'm 62 years old,'' said Conforte, who was brought to America
from Sicily in 1937 by his produce-salesman father. ``I only have a
few years left to live the good life and I want to enjoy them.''
   Mustang Ranch's gross revenue fell last year to $5.6 million
from $5.9 million in 1986, but profits rose to $917,000 from
$848,000, according to the prospectus.
   The prostitutes work as independent contractors, paying the
ranch $10 a day for meals and facilities and splitting the gross
receipts 50-50 with the house.
   The prospectus noted that the stock offering was a high-risk
venture because of potential lawsuits, adverse publicity and the
possibility that clients could get acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   Nevada law requires prostitutes to be tested monthly for AIDS,
and so far no working women have tested positive for the AIDS
virus. The brothels also require customers to use condoms to
protect against disease.
   The SEC planned to file a response to the investor group's
application within 20 days listing any deficiencies.
   If the stock offering is allowed, it would the first time a
bordello has become a publicly-held corporation.
   Conforte and his wife Sally began operations at the 440-acre
ranch in the late 1950s, when Nevada merely tolerated prostitution.
In 1971, Conforte won Storey County's approval for the brothel,
pioneering the statewide movement to allow prostitution in most
counties. The state now has about three dozen licensed brothels,
although none is as large as the Mustang.
   The couple has been trying to sell the ranch since early 1985,
when Conforte finished serving 18 months in prison on charges
involving $2 million in unpaid income taxes. He also served time
for an income tax conviction in the 1960s.
   At least $12 million in proceeds from the sale would go to pay
back the taxes, plus interest and penalties, Conforte said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A modified version of a natural poison kills
AIDS-infected cells in the test tube while ignoring normal cells,
offering a possible strategy to help treat AIDS, scientists
reported today.
   The specialized toxin may be able to kill infected cells in
people before the cells produce more viruses, said researcher
Bernard Moss of the National Institutes of Health.
   Moss, Ira Pastan and five other NIH scientists describe
experimental results in today's issue of the British journal Nature.
   In a second development, scientists at NIH and in Italy say they
have produced stable AIDS virus infections in rabbits, a step that
may help animal testing of AIDS vaccines and drugs. Until now, such
infections have been shown only in chimpanzees, which are costly
and in limited supply.
   The poison research involved Pseudomonas exotoxin A, which is
produced by bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is so strong
that a dose about the size of a salt grain can kill a human.
   ``We're encouraged both by the low amount of drug which is
effective'' and its ability to ignore uninfected cells in test-tube
experiments, said Moss.
   To make the poison seek out AIDS-infected cells, researchers
essentially replaced the part of the poison molecule that normally
guides the toxin to its target. In its place they put part of a
protein called CD4, which latches onto a protein found on the
surface of AIDS-infected cells.
   The redesigned poison was produced by combining genes for the
poison and the CD4, and placing them into bacteria called E. coli.
The bacteria, commonly used as a vehicle for gene splicing, then
churned out the hybrid poison.
   In test-tube experiments with white blood cells, the redesigned
poison killed infected cells while leaving uninfected ones unharmed.
   Moss said scientists still have to determine whether the poison
would reach all infected cells in the body, and whether it would
overlook infected cells in which the virus was lying dormant rather
than reproducing.
   While the toxin would not kill the virus that causes acquired
immune deficiency syndrome, previous research suggests it might
prevent the virus from infecting new cells, Moss said.
   Martin Hirsch of Harvard Medical School called the poison
research a scientific advance but said any medical usefulness will
take a long time to demonstrate. ``There is a long jump from the
test tube to the patient,'' he said.
   Also in today's issue of Nature, Italian scientists report AIDS
infections lasting a year in six rabbits. And in an interview this
week, Thomas Kindt of NIH said about 20 rabbits in his laboratory
have remained infected for up to about 10 months.
   Oliviero Varnier of the Institute of Microbiology in Genoa,
Italy, said in a telephone interview that four rabbits have now
stayed infected for 18 months. The other two died a month ago of
unknown causes, he said.
   His group injected the rabbits in the abdominal area with either
infected cells or free-floating virus. A few days before the
injection, the animals had been treated to produce white blood
cells in the abdominal area that would be ``ready to engulf
anything that you give to them,'' Varnier said.
   But no significant outward symptoms from the infections were
observed, Varnier and Kindt said.
   Kindt's experiments produced AIDS virus infection by injecting
infected human blood cells.
   Duke University researcher Dani Bolognesi said rabbit infections
may prove useful for vaccine and drug testing if they can be
produced routinely, and if they are found to mimic natural virus
infection closely enough.

   A Nigerian worker was crushed to death when
he was pinned in the doorway of an elevator in the basement of the
Transamerica pyramid building, police said.
   Washington B. Olaye, 32, was attempting to pull a mail cart into
the elevator Wednesday morning when ``for no apparent reason'' the
elevator began moving up, said police Officer Sherman Ackerson.
   A co-worker, identified as Isiah Sampson, was inside holding the
doors open for Olaye, Ackerson said. Both workers were heading to
the 18th floor to Montgomery Securities, where they worked.
   Olaye, standing on the elevator's threshhold, was pinned between
the elevator and the roof of the basement floor, Ackerson said.
   Fire Department personnel arrived and pried the door open, but
Olaye, who lived in nearby Oakland, was pronounced dead at the
scene by paramedics.
   An investigation was being conducted by federal and state worker
safety officials and the Otis Elevator Co., the manufacturer.
Elevators are not supposed to operate when the doors are open.

   An opponent activist says U.S. House
Speaker Jim Wright may have jeopardized the security of domestic
critics of the ruling Sandinistas by saying the CIA tried to
destabilize Nicaragua.
   Enrique Bolanos Gayer, a former president of the anti-Sandinista
Private Enterprise Council, on Wednesday called Wright's statements
``irresponsible, full of politicking and moral and ethical faults.''
   He said Wright made the comments out of ``ambition and a
partisan fight to reach the White House. ... In his internal
politicking, lacking ethics and morals, (Wright) is capable of
sacrificing the security of people.''
   Bolanos made his remarks from Miami to Radio Liberacion, the
Nicaraguan rebels' clandestine radio station.
   Wright, D-Texas, said Tuesday that Congress had received ``clear
testimony'' that the Reagan administration sought to secretly
undermine the Nicaraguan peace process, thus damaging long-term
prospects for an accord between the leftist Sandinistas and
U.S.-supported Contra rebels.
   President Reagan on Wednesday accused Wright of talking
indiscreetly about U.S. intelligence secrets, but stopped short of
denying the claim.
   The Sandinista government had no immediate response, but the
official newspaper Barricada ran a banner headline Wednesday
saying, ``CIA Confesses To Plan Melton.''
   In July, the Sandinistas expelled U.S. Ambassador Richard
Melton, saying he was carrying out an adminstration plan to
undermine Nicaragua's government by supporting opposition groups.
   The Sandinistas expelled him and seven other U.S. diplomats the
day after a July 10 rally they said was part of that plan. Police
arrested more than 40 opposition leaders at the big anti-government
march in the southern city of Nandaime after clashing with
protesters.
   The Contras said earlier this week that further talks to forge a
lasting peace to replace a March 23 preliminary cease-fire pact
cannot be held until the 40 are freed.
   The day after the Nandaime rally, the government suspended for
15 days the only opposition newspaper, La Prensa, and closed the
Roman Catholic radio station for 38 days.
   President Daniel Ortega said this week that the National
Endowment for Democracy, a U.S. government organization, provides
more than $600,000 for several opposition groups, including La
Prensa.
   According to a June 24 letter obtained by The Associated Press
from Rep. Robert Michel, R-Ill., to Gilberto Cuadra, president of
the Private Enterprise Council, the House was discussing an
additional $1 million to opposition groups, while Senate
legislation would provide $2 million.
   On Tuesday, the government said it had refused to grant
permission for an opposition march set for Sunday.
   An editorial Wednesday in Barricada advised the opposition
groups not to ``continue being ridiculous by soliciting permission
to take to the streets to provoke the authorities. We already know
the story.''

<HEAD>Government Suspends 33 Officials In Poaching Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has suspended 33 wildlife
officers suspected of collaborating with poachers who have
slaughtered scores of elephants, said a senior Ministry of Tourism
and Wildlife official.
   Josiah Sang, permanent secretary in the ministry, said in a
statement Wednesday that the action was take to rid the Department
of Wildlife of ``dishonest and unreliable officers who have been
found not only unproductive but also collaborating with poachers.''
   The department has acknowledged that poachers have killed 92
elephants in Tsavo National Park during the past four months.
   Five game wardens and policemen have been killed and at least
nine wounded in clashes with poachers during the past month,
officials said.
   In the most recent clash, on Friday, police officers exchanged
gunfire with about 50 suspected poachers in Tsavo. Newspapers said
a policeman and a ranch foreman were killed and nine policemen
wounded.
   The Daily Nation, a Nairobi newspaper, said police rounded up
more than 200 people for questioning over the weekend. Police also
searched vehicles passing through or near the park for game
trophies. There were no reports of arrests.
   It is illegal in Kenya to possess wild game trophies without a
permit and hunting is not allowed.
   President Daniel arap Moi ordered rangers on Sept. 13 to shoot
on sight poachers caught in the country's national parks and game
reserves. He gave the order after the government suspended mining
and prospecting in the country's 53 game and national parks, a move
aimed at denying poachers any cover.
   Studies by the Nairobi-based U.N. Environmental Program show
that in the past 15 years, Kenya's elephant population has dropped
85 percent. An aerial survey in February of the vast Tasvo park in
southeastern Kenya found 5,363 elephants, down from an estimated
35,000 in 1974.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Tyson Says He's Manic Depressive</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with newspaper report that Tyson is manic
depressive. No pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavyweight champion Mike Tyson says he was born
with manic depression and ``maybe that's why I'm successful at what
I do,'' but he realizes he has a problem he has to confront, the
New York Post reported.
   The interview, published in the newspaper today, occurred just
hours after Tyson hurled a radio at a television crew he confronted
while doing his morning run outside his New Jersey mansion on
Wednesday.
   Following that incident, the Post said, Tyson had a tearful talk
with his wife, actress Robin Givens, his mother-in-law, Ruth Roper,
and psychiatrist Henry L. McCurtis at which Tyson admitted being
out of control at times.
   ``I was born with this disease,'' the champion is quoted as
saying. ``I can't help it. Maybe that's why I'm successful at what
I do. I can't help it. This is the way I was all my life.''
   Tyson, 22, has had a series of violent incidents in the last
year. In August he fractured a bone in his right hand in a
late-night fistfight on a Harlem street with ex-boxer Mitch Green.
Earlier this month Tyson was hospitalized for several days after
smashing his car into a tree in Catskill, N.Y., where he trains.
   Following the car crash, the New York Daily News said sources
close to Tyson quoted the champion as threatening suicide shortly
before the wreck. Another source close to Tyson told The Associated
Press that the boxer had been depressed because Givens had been
staying in New York City rather than at his upstate training camp.
   Tyson denied the reports and, after being asked by Givens and
Roper to see McCurtis, said he did not need the help of a
psychiatrist.
   According to the Post, Tyson has changed his mind.
   ``I'm doing my best, talking to Dr. McCurtis,'' Tyson told the
Post. ``This is the beginning.''
   Tyson said he was relieved to find out he suffered from a
problem confronted by millions of Americans.
   ``It's not scary, it's just that I'm very abnormally
high-strung,'' Tyson said in the interview.
   Givens said it was a step in the right direction.
   ``If he's willing to make a commitment ... after an awful, awful
treacherous, scary morning, he made a commitment to try,'' she said.
   ``He's been like this for years and they've been ignoring it.
Michael takes a great deal of protecting. ... You can't put a
Band-aid on it. Who cares if he fights again. This guy's got to
live the rest of his life.''
   The Post said that Tyson's statements came after a stormy trip
to the Soviet Union. Tyson had several violent episodes in Moscow,
including chasing Givens, Roper and a secretary through their
hotel, the newspaper said, citing sources it did not identify.
   The Post said that before the trip to the Soviet Union McCurtis
had diagnosed Tyson as manic-depressive, a condition characterized
by alternating periods of mania and mental depression. Tyson and
Givens returned Tuesday night.
   Tyson went for a run Wednesday morning near his Bernardsville,
N.J., home and found a film crew from WNBC-TV in New York waiting
for him.
   When Tyson saw the crew, he hurled his portable radio at the
camera and then moved toward the crew. The incident later appeared
on the air.

<HEAD>Dollar Inches Up Against Yen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar inched up against the Japanese yen at
the close of trading Thursday, while share prices lost ground on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar opened at 134.35 yen and moved in a narrow range of
134.27-124.55 yen in light trading. It closed at 134.47 yen, up
0.29 yen from the previous day's close of 134.16 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the main index
on the stock exchange, declined 284.35 points, or 1.03 percent,
from Wednesday's close to finish the day's trade at 27,428.31.
   Exchange dealers said trading was slow as players were sidelined
ahead of a long holiday weekend in Japan. Markets will be closed
Friday for a national holiday, Autumn Equinox Day.
   Also an upcoming meeting of the group of seven, consisting of
finance ministers and central bank heads from seven industrial
nations, was scheduled over the weekend, prompting many market
participants to sit out and watch the situation Thursday, dealers
said.
   ``The basic trend is to buy the dollar, but it's not an active
one,'' said an exchange dealer with Sumitomo Bank in Tokyo. ``The
slight gain in the dollar today was a result of its rise in New
York (overnight),'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Securities dealers said share prices opened on bullishly, but
most institutional investors concentrated their purchases to
large-capital steel shares, leading to declines in other issues.
   ``Steel shares absorbed the market's energy,'' said a trader at
a Japanese securities firm, who asked not to be identified.
   One trader said buying interest was down due to continued
unconcertainty over the emperor's condition. Palace physicians say
the 87-year-old monarch is in stable but serious condition four
days after falling ill due to intestinal hemorrhaging.

<HEAD>EPA Cites Drinking Water as Possible Source of Household Radon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Environmental Protection Agency official
says radon gas evaporating out of drinking water could be ``as
large a contaminant as anything we're dealing with.''
   The agency has already said radon could be responsible for as
any as 20,000 deaths from lung cancer each year and Mike Cook, head
of the EPA's Office of Drinking Water, said a few hundred of those
may be caused by water-source radon.
   Radon, a radioactive gas that can be concentrated in houses,
generally arises from the soil beneath a home, working its way
through foundation cracks or other entrances.
   Cook, in an interview on a discussion on the ``USA Today
Television Show,'' quoted results of a survey of wells across the
country that said 72 percent had ``dangerously high'' radon levels.

   The government says a Colorado drug company is
recalling 50 million carbamazepine tablets for epilepsy treatment
because they do not dissolve properly and thus may not be as
effective as intended.
   The tablets are not harmful, but may not control or prevent
seizures as well as they should, the Food and Drug Administration
said Wednesday.
   Patients will not be able to identify the recalled tablets
themselves and should check with their pharmacies, the FDA said.
   The 200-milligram tablets are round, white and marked on one
side with one of three designations: 35@15, C66 or 832@G133.
   Pharmacies can check with information supplied to them by the

<HEAD>Soldiers and Civilians Vent Rage in Haitian Revolt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PIERRE-YVES GLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ More soldiers turned on their
commanders and civilian mobs slaughtered the henchmen of three
decades of Haitian dictators in the spreading chaos of a popular
soldiers' revolt.
   In an isolated case of loyalty to a commander, troops in the
northern port city of St. Marc killed a 12-year-old boy ednesday
when they fired into a mob about to attack the home of a sergeant
with a reputation for brutality, witnesses said.
   Rank-and-file soldiers in at least 16 military units throughout
the country have revolted against their commanders since ousting
and exiling Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy in a weekend coup and naming Lt.
Gen. Prosper Avril president.
   Avril tried unsuccessfully to quell the uprising on Tuesday by
naming a new armed forces chief and retiring nine unpopular
commanding officers.
   ``The situation is precarious. After all, we are in the midst of
a general mutiny,'' one Western diplomat said Wednesday, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   In the capital of Port-au-Prince, a leftist coalition called for
a popular show of support today for the mutineers. The
Confederation of Democratic Unity urged people to meet outside the
St. Jean Bosco Roman Catholic Church, where 13 worshipers were
killed and 77 wounded by thugs attacking with guns, pikes and
machetes during a Mass six days before the coup.
   The demonstration was previously scheduled for Wednesday and
confederation leaders had suspended it, saying they would meet
instead with the leader of the military rebellion, Sgt. Joseph
Heubreux, and Avril.
   There was no confirmation the meeting was held.
   A mob on Wednesday placed the smoldering body of a Tonton
Macoute killed the previous day at St. Bosco's, where several
hundred people gathered.
   The Macoutes were the private army of the regime created by
Francois Duvalier that ruled this impoverished nation for 29 years
until mass protests forced his son, Jean-Claude, into exile in
France in February 1986.
   Namphy then headed a junta that promised a transition to
democracy. However, independently run general elections Nov. 29
were thwarted when armed thugs supported by soldiers killed at
least 33 people at polling stations.
   Leslie Manigat, a civilian, was elected president in January in
military-run balloting that was boycotted by leading presidential
candidates amd marred by widespread irregularities. Namphy ousted
him in June.
   Radio stations estimated Wednesday that up to 12 Tonton Macoutes
had been killed by mobs and soldiers since Sunday.
   Rebellious soldiers rounded up agents of Namphy's Bureau of
Criminal Investigations Wednesday and dumped them _ some in
handcuffs _ at army headquarters in Port-au-Prince. About 200
people gathered and cheered each jeepload of soldiers with their
captives.
   The fate of the ousted military commanders dropped off there was
unknown.
   At least 11 commanders have been ousted since Monday. They
include former Defense Minister Brig. Gen. Williams Regala,
despised in Haiti for his ties to the Duvalier dictatorship.
   When they began their mutiny, the enlisted men led by Heubreux
and other members of the Presidential Guard presented the army high
command with a list of demands that included calls for Haiti's
first free elections in 31 years and for major changes in the
military.
   When the high command hesitated, soldiers took matters in their
own hands, ousting their commanders all over the Carribean country
of about 5 million people.
   ``The demands of the mutineers have been accepted; it has become
a people's army, at least for the moment,'' said a Western
diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Only pockets of soldiers have openly resisted.
   In St. Marc, some 60 miles north of the capital, troops loyal to
Capt. Ernst Ravix, accused by townspeople of corruption and
brutality, put down popular demonstrations Wednesday, killing the
12-year-old, Nilo Chailes, and wounding three people, witnesses
said.
   The soldiers later went to a local jail, freed several
prisoners, and marched triumphantly through the city of 15,000 to
popular acclaim. But the crowd was not fully placated and later
shouted at Ravix: ``Macoute, Macoute!''
   Radio Inter reported Wednesday that mutineers battled other
troops, with one soldier dead in a clash Tuesday in Jacmel, about
45 miles south of Port-au-Prince.
   On Tuesday, workers at government companies struck to unseat
state-appointed managers in other action apparently aimed at wiping
out remnants of Namphy's rule.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Stocks Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar gained marginally on the Tokyo foreign
exchange market today while share prices declined sharply on the
Stock Exchange.
   After opening at 134.35 yen, the dollar moved in a narrow range
of 134.27-134.55 yen in light trading. It closed at 134.47 yen, up
0.29 yen from the previous day's close.
   Exchange dealers said the slight gain reflected strong showing
of the currency in New York and London overnight, but the lack of
fresh incentives prevented the dollar from strengthening further.
   ``The dollar is in a difficult position to move too far because
of the upcoming Group of Seven meeting,'' said an exchange dealer
in Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``But market
participants are expecting no major changes in the meeting,
either.''
   The meeting of the Group of Seven, in which foreign ministers
and central bank chiefs from the seven major industrialized nations
discuss international economic and fiscal policies, is scheduled on
Saturday in West Berlin.
   Foreign Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said he expects the current
international cooperation in fiscal policies will be maintained
after that meeting.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the main index
on the stock exchange, declined 284.35 points, or 1.03 percent,
from Wednesday's close to finish the day's trading at 27,428.31.
   Securities dealers attributed the drop of share prices to profit
taking.
   ``After the news of the Emperor's ailing health shook Japan
Monday night, the general direction of the market has been
negative,'' said a dealer at a major securities firm. ``So everyone
is trying to take advantage of yesterday's gain.''
   Despite the downward trend, the Nikkei index gained 164.08
points Wedneday.
   Most securities dealers expect the market will remain
directionless and unpredictable until Emperor Hirohito's condition
becomes clearer.
   ``The market as a whole appears to be regaining energy after
more than a month long slump,'' said another dealer at a major
securities firm, requesting anonymity. ``The increased volume and
the popularity of large-capital shares are one of the signs of
that.''
   The volume traded on the first section of the exchange, where
most major shares are listed, was 850 million shares.
   Both the Tokyo Stock Exchange and Tokyo foreign exchange markets
will be closed Friday because of a national holiday. The stock
exchange will have a half day session Saturday while foreign
exchange dealing will remain closed until Monday.

   Thirty-eight people were hurt
across South Africa in five bombings over nine hours, according to
police, who said the first blast injured 18 whites, while the
next-to-last hurt 19 blacks.
   A 1 a.m. blast today inside the Why Not disco in the
Johannesburg suburb of Hillbrow injured 19 blacks, three seriously,
and caused extensive damage, police said. The disco is frequented
almost exclusively by blacks.
   During the Wednesday evening rush hour, a bomb exploded at the
main white bus terminal in downtown Johannesburg, injuring 19
people, all but one of them white, police said.
   The explosion occurred just after 5 p.m. in one of the new
concrete trash bins installed throughout the city last year to
muffle the effects of bombs. It shattered windows of four buses,
damaged a fast-food cafe, and broke the windows of buildings and
cars in the area.
   Meanwhile, police said early today that bombs exploded overnight
in Pretoria and in the southern towns of King William's Town and
Fort Beaufort. There were no injuries in the three attacks, police
said.
   In Pretoria, a bomb placed at the front door extensively damaged
the home of Shakes el Goolam, an Asian candidate in the municipal
elections next month, police said. The explosion occurred at 1:25
a.m.
   In Fort Beaufort, an explosive device damaged the back of a
public library and in King William's Town, a suspected mini-limpet
mine exploded in the front of the magistrate's court building.
   No one claimed responsibility for any of the attacks.
   Minister of Law and Order Adriaan Vlok described the blast at
the bus terminal as a ``repulsive act'' carried out by ''cowards.''
   There have been more than 110 bombings in South Africa since the
government declared a nationwide state of emergency in June 1986.
Police have blamed virtually all the attacks on the outlawed
African National Congress, the main black group attempting to
overthrow the white minority government.
   However, in recent weeks bombs have exploded at the headquarters
of anti-apartheid groups and at public facilities frequented mostly
by blacks.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no say in
national affairs.

   An American Airlines 727 jetliner was
forced to make an emergency belly landing at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport when its main landing gear jammed, officials
said. There were no serious injuries.
   Passengers evacuated Flight 135 on an emergency slide Wednesday,
according to John Hotard, a spokesman for the airline. Hotard said
there was no fire and only one person was hurt, suffering a minor
ankle injury.
   The airplane, originating in Oklahoma City with 81 passengers
and seven crew members, landed on the same runway where Delta
Flight 1141 crashed on takeoff Aug. 31, killing 14 people,
officials said.
   American spokesman Jim Brown said the pilot could not extend one
of the two main landing gears under the belly of the plane. He
retracted the one functioning landing gear before making his
approach, Brown said.
   After circling the airport to expend fuel for the emergency
landing, airline officials said the pilot brought the 150-seat
plane in around 9:40 p.m. with only its nose landing gear extended.
   Airport workers sprayed the aircraft with flame-retardant foam,
officials said. The emergency slides were deployed and passengers
evacuated, Hotard said. No one was taken to a hospital, officials
of the airport's Department of Public Safety said.
   Also Wednesday, another American flight en route to Dallas-Fort
Worth from Charlotte, N.C., was forced to make a non-scheduled
landing in Nashville, Tenn., because of possible engine trouble.
   Airline spokesman Al Becker said the pilot shut off one engine
as a precaution before landing in Nashville. Passengers were moved
to another plane to continue their trip, officials said.

<HEAD>Court Orders Work Permits, Bars Deportation of Aliens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has barred the
deportation of up to 100,000 aliens until it decides whether the
Immigration and Naturalization Service was too restrictive in
denying them amnesty.
   In a decision made public Wednesday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals also authorized temporary work permits for the aliens.
   The court ordered the temporary measures until it rules on
whether the INS exceeded its authority by denying amnesty to aliens
who had left the United States briefly. Depending on its ruling,
the court could reopen the now-expired deadline for aliens to apply
for amnesty under the new immigration law.
   The court said it would hear arguments in the case in November
under an accelerated schedule. The government is appealing a
federal judge's ruling in April that the INS interpreted the
grounds for amnesty too narrowly.
   ``This is a great day for our system of justice,'' said Ralph
Abascal, a California Rural Legal Assistance lawyer in the case. He
said four other federal judges around the nation have restricted
INS enforcement of related provisions of the amnesty law, but that
this was the first order from an appellate court.
   The number of aliens potentially affected by the case is
estimated to be from 50,000 to 100,000 nationwide, he said.
   Justice Department lawyer Scott McIntosh, who represented the
INS, declined comment.
   The new immigration law allowed aliens who have been in the U.S.
continuously since Jan. 1, 1982, to apply for amnesty by May, the
first step toward legal residence.
   A trip outside the country that is ``brief, casual and
innocent'' does not disqualify an alien from amnesty. Under an INS
interpretation, however, any departure after May 1, 1987, when
amnesty applications began, that lacked advance approval from the
INS could not be ``innocent'' and made the alien ineligible for
amnesty.
   Abascal said in a statement that the INS had used its reading of
the law to bar amnesty to several aliens who had made brief trips
to Mexico to see a dying relative, and to one who fell asleep in a
car shortly before his friends went to Tijuana for a two-hour
frolic.
   Chief U.S. District Judge Lawrence Karlton of Sacramento ruled
in April that the INS interpretation was not authorized by the law.
After finding that numerous aliens had been denied amnesty
improperly or had been discouraged from applying, he issued a
nationwide order in June reopening the application period through
Nov. 30, which the government appealed.
   The appeals court decision requires that the government question
any aliens arrested under the immigration law to see if they would
be eligible for amnesty if not for foreign travel of the kind
covered by the suit. If so, the aliens must be released without
bond and given work permits while the court case is pending.
   The same rights must be provided to aliens who approach the INS
with questions about their status and are covered by the case.
   Abascal said the INS also is required to contact aliens who have
been denied amnesty because of brief trips out of the country and
tell them their cases are being reopened.

   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, protected by
a bulletproof vest and shield, appealed for help in his
government's fight against Sikh terrorism on his first visit to the
embattled Punjab since 1985.
   Gandhi placed the foundation stone for a new paper mill in this
small village amid tight security on his one-day trip Wednesday to
the northern state, where Sikh extremists are fighting for an
independent homeland.
   The government hopes the $170 million mill will help pump new
life into a state shattered by six years of guerrilla and terrorist
attacks.
   Sikh radicals have killed more than 1,950 people in Punjab this
year, nearly double the toll for 1987.
   The prime minister was accompanied by more than 6,000
paramilitary troops, mostly armed with steel-tipped bamboo sticks,
and stood at the podium behind a bulletproof shield.
   ``The anti-nationals want to break democracy in India, but we
must give our lives to maintain it,'' Gandhi said, wearing a
bulletproof vest as he addressed the crowd of 15,000 factory
workers, students and teachers.
   ``We have no fight with the Sikhs, only the terrorists. We are
fighting strongly, and we are getting results,'' the prime minister
said, speaking in Hindi.
   Punjab is the only Indian state with a Sikh majority.
Nationwide, members of the Sikh faith comprise just 2 percent of
India's 800 million people, but they form 60 percent of Punjab's 18
million people.
   Punjab has been one of the biggest crises for the Gandhi
government, which fears the separatist movement could become a
full-scale civil war and fan insurgencies by other restless
minorities.
   ``We maintain respect for all religions,'' Gandhi told the crowd.
   Gandhi's mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, was assassinated
by two of her Sikh bodyguards in October 1984, four months after
she ordered an army raid on the Golden Temple in the Punjab city of
Amritsar, where Sikh militants were holed up. More than 2,000
people, mostly Sikhs, died in the raid on Sikhdom's holiest shrine.

   The signs today read ``7 Days to
Launch'' as NASA prepares for Discovery to lift off with five
astronauts on a flight the space agency hopes will restore
credibility to America's manned space program.
   The signs, at entrances to the Kennedy Space Center, greet the
13,000 workers here who have labored 32 months since the Challenger
tragedy to return the shuttle to flight.
   Next Thursday, barring any problems, Discovery will be fuming on
the launch pad, its flight crew ready to go.
   Spirits are high among shuttle workers. They began soaring after
a successful launch pad test-firing of Discovery's engines Aug. 10
and an almost flawless countdown practice Sept. 8, the last two
hurdles before launch.
   ``We clearly demonstrated we are ready to pick up the count for
real,'' the space center director, Forrest S. McCartney, told
cheering workers after the countdown test.
   But one possible threat to Discovery's launch was revealed
Wednesday, when NASA officials said an old-model nozzle inlet ring
was used in the final test of Morton Thiokol's redesigned space
shuttle booster rocket.
   However, NASA doesn't believe the finding will delay next week's
launch, spokesman Ed Medal said.
   Medal said it had not yet been determined conclusively if
outdated rings were used in the two boosters attached to Discovery,
but a preliminary investigation showed they had not.
   Kennedy Space Center has adopted the slogan ``America's Pride
... The Journey Continues'' for Discovery's mission. It is
proclaimed on a banner at the launch pad entrance, in offices and
on thousands of pins worn by employees ranging from engineers to
secretaries.
   At the launch pad today, technicians were set to purge
Discovery's fuel cells and external fuel tank with gases to remove
possible contaminants, install batteries in the communications
satellite in the cargo bay, and complete other last-minute
preparations for the start of the countdown at 12:01 a.m. Monday.
   At Johnson Space Center in Houston, Discovery's crew was
scheduled to discuss the mission in late afternoon during a visit
with President Reagan. Afterwards, Reagan was to address center
workers on the space program.
   Once the countdown is under way, the astronauts will fly here
Monday afternoon to make final preparations for flight.
   Commanding the crew is Navy Capt. Frederick Hauck. The pilot is
Air Force Col. Richard O. Covey and the mission specialists are
Marine Lt. Col. David Hilmers, George D. Nelson and John M. Lounge.
All are veteran shuttle fliers.
   During four days in orbit they are scheduled to deploy a
communications satellite, conduct 11 science and technology
experiments and check out more than 200 modifications made to the
vehicle.
   Most of the changes are intended to make the shuttle safer and
were instituted after the Challenger explosion that killed seven
crew members on Jan. 28, 1986. The shuttle fleet has been grounded
since the accident.

<HEAD>Latest Poll Shows Presidential Dead Heat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   George Bush and Michael Dukakis are locked in a
statistical dead heat in a presidential race that could be decided
by a large number of independents who remain undecided, according
to a poll released today by The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta
Constitution.
   Bush, the Republican nominee, held a 43-40 percent lead over the
Democratic candidate, a margin that close to others that have shown
him picking up ground quickly since the GOP convention in August.
   Another 15 percent were undecided, however, including 40 percent
of the registered voters who labeled themselves independent.
   The survey completed Sunday polled 2,355 voters nationwide. It
has a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage point,
rendering Bush's advantage potentially insignificant.
   Of those calling themselves independent, 33 percent said they
favored Bush and 22 percent chose Dukakis.

   Republican George Bush has pulled even with
Michael Dukakis in Maryland, a state where Democrats hold a
two-to-one edge over Republicans, according to a new poll.
   The results released Wednesday by WBAL-TV show Bush closing a
Dukakis lead that had been 21 percentage points several months ago.
   In the latest survey of 638 likely voters conducted Sept. 8-11,
Dukakis was favored by a margin of 48-47 percent, with 5 percent
undecided. The margin of error of the poll was plus or minus three
percentage points.
   The poll was conducted for the television station by Western
Maryland College political science professor Herbert C. Smith.

   A piece of the engine of a Pan Am Express
commuter airplane broke off, punctured one of the craft's windows
and entered the passenger cabin, injuring as many as nine people,
authorities said.
   A witness described a ``loud bang'' about 10 minutes before the
four-engine DeHavilland-7 turboprop was dueto land Wednesday at
Albany County Airport with 13 passengers and three crew members
aboard.
   The pilot of Flight 878, which originated at John F. Kennedy
International Airport in New York City, said nothing to the
passengers and the 50-seat craft appeared to land normally, said
one passenger, A.K. Gupta said.
   There were conflicting reports of injuries early today. Todd
Saterlee, manager of passenger services for Pan Am Express, said
there were seven people hurt. However, a spokesman for the Albany
Medical Center Hospital said nine people were admitted there.
   All but one of those injured were treated and released, said the
spokesman, Richard Puff. The injuries consisted of smoke
inhalation, cuts from glass fragments or, in one case, a minor
burn, said Puff.
   The only passenger admitted was Steven Roecker, 33, of Rexford.
He suffered eye and facial injuries and was in fair condition, Puff
said. His wife, Deborah, 40, was treated for a leg injury and smoke
inhalation.
   Gupta, a General Electric Co. executive who said he was
traveling from India, said the incident happened three rows behind
his seat on the plane's right side.
   ``I was asleep. There was a loud noise and there was smoke at
the same time and a child started crying,'' he said. One injured
man appeared to have ``a lot of blood on his clothes,'' he added.
   ``Apparently a piece of the engine did separate and puncture one
of the windows,'' said Pan Am spokesman Jeff Krindler.
   The Federal Aviation Administration and the National
Transportation Safety Board were investigating the accident, said
Todd Satterlee, manager of passenger services for Pan Am Express.
He refused to answer questions.

<TEXT>
   The nation's railroads routinely use freight
and passenger cars with defective brakes, wheels and undercarriages
despite warnings from safety inspectors, according to a newspaper
report.
   Business pressures have created a tug-of-war between inspectors
who order cars repaired in the shop and transportation employees
who schedule trains, said Peter Brawley, assistant general foreman
of Amtrak's coach yard at Philadelphia's 30th Street Station.
   ``I'm not going to tell you that there aren't cars getting out
of here that shouldn't be moving. It happens,'' Brawley told The
Pittsburgh Press in an article published Wednesday.
   ``An inspector finds something wrong and wants to shop the car,
but transportation needs that car for a train leaving in three
hours, so the car goes out,'' he said.
   In addition to Amtrak, the nation's only long-distance passenger
rail line, problems were found with Conrail and CSX freight trains,
the Press said.
   However, the newspaper did not link any train derailments or
other major service problems to the defects.
   Wayne Geist, an engineer on Amtrak's Broadway Limited on the
Pittsburgh-Harrisburg leg of its Chicago-New York run, said he was
ordered June 19 not to slow down despite repeatedly reporting that
his speedometer did not work.
   ``I'm talking about taking a train loaded with 400 or 500
passengers up and down the steepest grades in Pennsylvania, where a
difference of 5 or 10 mph will not only violate Conrail's, Amtrak's
and the (federal) rules, but also endanger the passengers,'' Geist
said.
   Amtrak Chairman W. Graham Claytor said his company runs ``safe
operations,'' although conditions are not ideal.
   ``Business is so good we overutilize our equipment,'' he said.
``We have a whole lot of mechanical failures on the road, more than
we should. We turn around equipment too fast, but we can't let it
lay over 48 hours. If we do that, a lot of people are not going to
be able to ride.
   ``But ... we are not going to cut corners on safety or on our
basic maintenance policy,'' Claytor said.
   The Press said it learned that one Amtrak car was used between
Harrisburg and Philadelphia from June 18 until July 5 even though
inspectors had found a steel wheel marked by a heat crack that
could have caused the wheel to shatter.
   The newspaper said three cars that derailed in the 30th Street
Station yard June 29 were sent out unrepaired on a Philadelphia-New
York run despite Amtrak policy requiring the replacement of any
wheels that leave the track.
   ``There was a serious mistake made by releasing those three
cars,'' said Robert Burk, chief mechanical officer of the federally
subsidized rail service.
   The Press said it documented similar problems a week later in
Chicago on Amtrak's California Zephyr bound for San Francisco, the
Empire Builder bound for Seattle and the Capitol Limited bound for
Washington, D.C.
   At Conrail's giant Enola yard at Harrisburg, the newspaper said
it observed a man in a supervisor's white hardhat in mid-June
remove nine tags that inspectors had attached to freight cars to
indicate the need for major repairs.
   All nine cars were returned to service despite the defects,
which the newspaper said included a cracked undercarriage on a
tanker.
   Similar activity was documented at Conrail yards in Buffalo,
N.Y., Conway, Pa., and Columbus, Ohio, the newspaper said.
   Donald Rugh, an Ohio Public Utility Commission rail inspector,
said: ``I get the Conrail trains that come out of Conway when they
get into Canton, and they are loaded with defects. I have found 25
or 30 on a single train, ranging the full gamut from bad air brakes
to broken handholds.''
   Richard Hasselman, Conrail's vice president for operations,
responded that he believes inspections are being conducted properly
because supervisors make spot checks regularly.
   Hasselman said cars are tagged sometimes for repairs that aren't
needed and sometimes no defects are found on a tagged car.
   The Press cited its own observations and inspectors' records in
reporting that CSX freight cars with defects ranging from
inoperable brakes to cracked couplers were allowed to roll from
yards in Atlanta, Nashville, Hazard, Ky., and other locations.
   However, A. Crane Jones, a senior vice president at CSX,
retorted:
   ``If we find any supervisor doing that, or allowing this to be
done, well ... we have a saying on the railroad that we would
almost make a milepost out of him.''

   Police have seized a van loaded with
military gear and arrested two black men suspected of plotting to
rescue two men alleged to be South African commandos, the Botswana
Press Agency reported.
   The agency said Wednesday that police found a pistol, silencer,
ammunition, two-way radio and wire-cutter in a van belonging to
Johannes Zitha, 29, a South African.
   It said he was arrested Sunday in Francistown, Botswana, where
the two alleged commandos are to go on trial next week in
connection with a cross-border raid in June.
   On Monday, the Botswanan defense attorney for the two white
South Africans was arrested in connection with the alleged escape
plot. The news agency quoted police as saying the attorney, Duncan
Morotsi, was arrested while in possession of unspecified
``undesirable'' items.
   Andrew Matlapeng, a divisional police commander, was quoted as
saying that the wire-cutter may have been intended for use in
trying to rescue the alleged commandos from Francistown Prison.
   The two were captured in June during a cross-border raid by
South African soldiers. They are Johannes Basson, 25, identified by
police as a South African army corporal, and Theodore Hermansen,
identified as a police reservist. Both are charged with attempted
murder, violation of national security laws, and other offenses.
   South African military headquarters confirmed that it sent an
army unit into Botswana on June 20 on an anti-guerrilla mission. It
said the soldiers escaped back into South Africa after a
confrontation with Botswana police in which three policemen were
injured.
   Basson and Hermansen, wearing civilian clothes, were arrested
after the shooting while trying to pass through a roadblock in a
Botswana police car. South African authorities have neither
confirmed nor denied that the two were involved in the cross-border
mission.
   On Wednesday, South African military headquarters denied any
knowledge of Zitha.
   South African forces have staged numerous cross-border raids in
the past on suspected facilities in Botswana and neighboring states
of the African National Congress, the main guerrilla organization
fighting to end white minority rule in South Africa.

   A man on parole for manslaughter and held
for harassment was freed on $500 bail and allowed to commit a
double murder-suicide because a judge did not take steps to
discover the man's violent past, a report said.
   The report by Morris County Assignment Judge Reginald Stanton
also said failures by probation officers, prosecutors and family
caseworkers contributed to the release of Nicolas Vutca of
Parsippany-Troy Hills.
   No officials will be disciplined, however, because no one was
guilty of ``repeated acts'' of violating proper procedures, Stanton
said.
   Vutca, a Romanian national, killed his wife, Dorina, and her
mother, Maria Vacariu, on Sept. 10 at their home in Effort, Pa.,
and then shot himself to death.
   ``Looking at the total situation, we see an incredible
combination of things that went wrong,'' said Stanton's report,
which was released Tuesday and submitted to state Supreme Court
Chief Justice Robert Wilentz.
   ``If any one of them had gone right, the tragic consequence
might have been avoided.''
   Vutca was convicted of aggravated manslaughter in 1983 in the
stabbing death a year earlier of his live-in girlfriend. He was
paroled in 1986 and married Dorina last year.
   Vutca was arrested Aug. 17 on charges of harassment and
violating a court order to stay away from his wife. Mrs. Vutca and
her mother then moved to Pennsylvania.
   Superior Court Judge Karen D. Russell set bail at $25,000 the
day of the arrest. The next day, Morris County Judge Paul Bangiola,
in a routine bail-review hearing, reduced the bail to $5,000, or
$500 if paid in cash.
   Vutca posted bail, tracked down his wife and mother-in-law and
shot them to death, authorities said.
   Stanton's report said Bangiola didn't know about Vutca's
manslaughter conviction when he lowered bail because Ms. Russell's
bail memorandum mentioning the conviction didn't arrive on his desk
until the next day.
   The report also said a probation officer failed to notify the
county prosecutor's office about Bangiola's hearing, and the
hearing was conducted without a prosecutor present.
   The report said ``many judges in Judge Bangiola's position would
have seen the $25,000 bail and suspected that the case must involve
something more than verbal threats.'' It said Bangiola could have
telephoned Ms. Russell or taken other steps to find out more about
Vutca's background.
   Bangiola said through his secretary he would not comment on the
report.
   Stanton said judges and court employees have been
``re-educated'' about proper procedures, and that workers and the
prosecutor's office have been encouraged to inform him or other
judges ``when they think something has gone wrong.''

<HEAD>Youth Says He's Sorry For Burning Synagogue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Congregation Sharai Torah observed Yom Kippur
at a nearby Jewish school, a 12-year-old boy apologized for setting
fire to the congregation's building days earlier.
   Two youths were arrested on arson and other charges after they
allegedly spray-painted swastikas on the walls of the Orthodox
synagogue, set a fire and unrolled and burned six Torahs, the
sacred handwritten scrolls that contain the first five books of the
Old Testament.
   The crime, on the Sabbath before Yom Kippur, shocked Brooklyn's
huge Jewish community. An estimated 10,000 people turned out Sunday
for a memorial service for the burned Torahs.
   ``We believe that everything, including this fire, is from
God,'' said the president of the 300-member Brooklyn congregation,
Hirsch Wolf.
   The president of the Rabbinical Council of America, Rabbi Max N.
Schreier, issued a statement Wednesday calling it an ``act of
ruthless vandalism the likes of which have not been seen since the
Holocaust.''
   One of the accused youths, a 12-year-old boy identified only by
his first name, Joey, said he was only out to have fun Saturday
morning when he and a 15-year-old companion desecrated the
synagogue.
   In an interview with New York Newsday published Wednesday, Joey
said he hadn't known what a synagogue was and did not vandalize it
out of anti-Semitism. If he had the opportunity, he said, he would
tell members of the congregation, ``I'm really sorry.''
   Meanwhile, the president of a Bellaire, Ohio, synagogue that
closed two years ago donated a Torah to the Brooklyn congregation.
The Torah was flown to New York Tuesday in time for the sundown
start of Yom Kippur, the most solemn holiday on the Jewish calendar.

   A piece of the engine of a Pan Am Express
commuter airplane broke off, punctured one of the craft's windows
and entered the passenger cabin, injuring as many as nine people,
authorities said.
   A witness described a ``loud bang'' about 10 minutes before the
four-engine DeHavilland-7 turboprop was dueto land Wednesday at
Albany County Airport with 13 passengers and three crew members
aboard.
   The pilot of Flight 878, which originated at John F. Kennedy
International Airport in New York City, said nothing to the
passengers and the 50-seat craft appeared to land normally, said
one passenger, A.K. Gupta said.
   There were conflicting reports of injuries early today. Todd
Saterlee, manager of passenger services for Pan Am Express, said
there were seven people hurt. However, a spokesman for the Albany
Medical Center Hospital said nine people were admitted there.
   All but one of those injured were treated and released, said the
spokesman, Richard Puff. The injuries consisted of smoke
inhalation, cuts from glass fragments or, in one case, a minor
burn, said Puff.
   The only passenger admitted was Steven Roecker, 33, of Rexford.
He suffered eye and facial injuries and was in fair condition, Puff
said. His wife, Deborah, 40, was treated for a leg injury and smoke
inhalation.
   Gupta, a General Electric Co. executive who said he was
traveling from India, said the incident happened three rows behind
his seat on the plane's right side.
   ``I was asleep. There was a loud noise and there was smoke at
the same time and a child started crying,'' he said. One injured
man appeared to have ``a lot of blood on his clothes,'' he added.
   ``Apparently a piece of the engine did separate and puncture one
of the windows,'' said Pan Am spokesman Jeff Krindler.
   The Federal Aviation Administration and the National
Transportation Safety Board were investigating the accident, said
Todd Satterlee, manager of passenger services for Pan Am Express.
He refused to answer questions.

<HEAD>Study Finds Fish Oil Promising Addition to Common Heart Procedure</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Fish oil provides the first effective way of
keeping newly opened heart arteries working smoothly after
angioplasty, a procedure used on 200,000 Americans annually with
heart disease, according to a study published today.
   ``It looks very promising,'' said Dr. Gregory J. Dehmer. ``It's
the only agent so far that has even shown a hint of having an
effect. This study is a little like the light at the end of the
tunnel.''
   Dehmer, now a cardiologist at the University of North Carolina,
was in charge of the fish oil experiment at the Veterans
Administration Medical Center in Dallas.
   Angioplasty is widely used because it provides a non-surgical
alternative to coronary bypass operations for people with coronary
artery disease. Doctors use tiny balloons to squeeze open clogged
heart arteries.
   A major drawback of the procedure is restenosis, the spontaneous
reclosing of the newly cleared arteries. This happens in about
one-third of all patients within six months of their angioplasties.
   When the VA doctors tested fish oil on 82 men, they found that
it cut the restenosis rate by two to three times in men who were at
especially high risk of this complication.
   Reaction from other experts was mixed.
   Dr. Alexander Leaf of Massachusetts General Hospital, who is
conducting a major study of fish oil in angioplasty, said he
believes the therapy works.
   But Dr. Spencer B. King III of Emory University commented: ``My
main concern is that a lot of small studies have made it look like
restenosis was helped by so many different interventions. I would
like to see bigger numbers before I buy into this.''
   The study was published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine. One similar recent study also found that fish oil seemed
to prevent restenosis, while two others showed no effect.
   ``Although it's in the New England Journal, it's a little
premature to rush out and buy a carload of fish oil for every
angioplasty patient,'' said Dr. Donald Baim of Boston's Beth Israel
Hospital, a co-author of one of the negative studies.
   The researchers said they do not recommend that all angioplasty
patients take fish oil, because their study was too small to be the
basis of sweeping recommendations. And they said people undergoing
angioplasties should not take the supplements unless they discuss
it with their doctors.
   However, Dr. Eric H. Eichhorn, a co-author of the study,
commented, ``If I were undergoing angioplasty, the balance of
potential benefits versus risks is such that I would take it
myself.''
   Fish oil capsules, widely available in drug and health stores,
have been advertised as a way of warding off heart disease,
although evidence is still skimpy.
   Eskimos who eat large quantities of oily fish, such as salmon,
have remarkably low levels of heart disease. However, doctors
disagree over whether fish oil capsules will prevent the gradual
buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries, a process called
atherosclerosis, that underlies heart attacks.
   Leaf said the latest study suggests to him that fish oil
capsules may be of benefit to everyone at risk of heart disease,
not just those undergoing angioplasty.
   ``Since angioplasty restenosis pathologically appears to be a
very rapid progression of atherosclerosis, the fact that they find
they can prevent restenosis suggests that fish oil will prevent
coronary heart disease and heart attacks,'' Leaf said.
   In the latest study, half the patients took 18 capsules of
MaxEPA fish oil daily, starting a week before their angioplasties
and continuing for six months. After three months, 19 percent of
those who took fish oil had restenosis, compared with 46 percent in
the comparison group.

   The landmark 1986 tax overhaul boosted the
bite on 250 giant, profitable corporations by about $9 billion last
year but still left 16 of them legally paying no federal income
tax, a private research group said today.
   The number among the 250 that paid no tax was down from 40 in
1986 and from a high of 72 in 1982, according to Citizens for Tax
Justice, a labor-financed organization whose reports were credited
with helping win passage of the new tax law two years ago.
   The 1986 law cut tax rates for most individuals and corporations
but took away or reduced several deductions and credits. One result
was to shift about $125 billion of the federal tax burden from
individuals to corporations over a five-year period.

<HEAD>Onset Of Dry Weather Doesn't Concern Yellowstone Firefighters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Warmer, drier weather was
returning today but officials expressed confidence that the fires
that have blackened half of the oldest national park would not
flare anew.
   Meanwhile, a newspaper report said park officials allowed fires
to burn unattended for nearly three weeks after they were ordered
to fight all fires because they wanted to protect pristine areas
from the destruction caused by bulldozers, fire engines and
irrigation equipment. In all, the fires have blackened roughly half
the park's 2.2 million acres.
   Elsewhere, officials banned outdoor smoking in parts of northern
California and hundreds of firefighters prepared to go home after a
9,000-acre blaze in Oregon was contained.
   The National Weather Service confirmed what firefighters in
Yellowstone already knew: This summer was one of the park's warmest
and driest on record.
   The weather service said Wednesday that temperatures at the
Mammoth area of the park in June averaged 55.4, or 7.8 degrees
higher than average. Average temperature in July was 66.4 degrees,
2.8 degrees above average. Temperatures were just slightly above
normal in August.
   Rainfall totals were more than an inch less than normal each
month, and the weather service said it is unlikely any major
precipitation will offset the park's shortage soon.
   Steady rain Tuesday prevented the remaining blazes from growing
significantly. Although skies have since cleared, longer nights are
bringing longer periods of ``humidity recovery,'' when small fuels
such as pine needles and twigs can soak up moisture, area commander
Ken Dittmer said.
   ``The worst is over,'' Dittmer said.
   Forecasts for the weekend called for another cooling trend,
accompanied by a chance of showers, which could help the 4,500
firefighters battling the blazes. Winds are expected to remain calm.
   The New York Times reported today that officials concerned about
the destruction caused by firefighting equipment did not fight the
Yellowstone portion of the Clover-Mist fire until nearly three
weeks after Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel's July 21 order that
all fires be fought.
   Bulldozers were allowed in the park only on a case-by-case basis
even at the height of the fires, the paper reported, and bulldozers
were never used to make fire lines around the Yellowstone part of
the Clover-Mist blaze, which has burned 411,000 acres in the park
and the adjacent Shoshone National Forest.
   The Times also reported that park rangers threatened a
firefighting crew with citations for destroying park vegetation
when they crossed a meadow with their truck to extinguish a spot
fire.
   Elsewhere, state firefighters battling blazes that have charred
more than 40,000 acres in northern California issued an emergency
decree banning outdoor smoking in portions of 44 counties.
   Jerry Partain, director of the California Department of
Forestry, said ``the extreme danger'' posed by fire and acute dry
conditions prompted the decree.
   Fire officials predicted they will have the Vacaville fire out
by Saturday evening. The blaze has destroyed seven homes, blackened
27,000 acres and caused an estimated $1.83 million in damage.
   In Oregon, 400 firefighters were scheduled to go home from the
Shady Beach fire in Willamette National Forest after the blaze was
contained at just under 9,000 acres Wednesday night, U.S. Forest
Service spokesman Chuck Tonn said. Another 400 firefighters are
scheduled for release Friday, leaving fewer than 1,000 on the
lines, he said.

Two</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A sniper taking cover in a park opened fire
on passing cars, injuring an 18-month-old child and four other
people and prompting the evacuation of nearby residents before
apparently killing himself, police said today.
   A police search for the gunman ended at 3:45 a.m. when the body
of the man was found in the back yard of a home, police said.
   In an unrelated attack, an off-duty policeman and his 3-year-old
son were wounded by gunfire on a freeway in City of Industry late
Wednesday, police said. City of Industry is a town about 15 miles
east of here.
   No motive was known for either attack.
   In the Los Angeles attack, a gunman started randomly shooting at
cars at about 11 p.m. Wednesday in a park on the city's west side,
said Officer D. Sharp.
   The victims were taken to UCLA Medical Center, where one was in
critical condition with a gunshot wound to the chest, Molony said.
   Two others were in stable condition, one with a gunshot wound to
the jaw, the other with a gunshot wound to the hip. The
18-month-old and her mother were treated for minor gunshot wounds
and released, he said.
   Residents in about 10 homes were evacuated, police said.
   Officer Frank Anguiano, 24, and his son Frank Jr. were treated
for minor gunshot wounds at White Memorial Medical Center in Boyle
Heights following the 10:05 p.m. shooting on a Pomona Freeway
off-ramp in City of Industry, police said.
   The shooting was apparently a random attack on the two, said Los
Angeles police Lt. William Hall.
   Police would not say whether any arrests had been made.

<TEXT>
   A 7-year-old accused of making sexual
remarks and waving an unloaded .38-caliber handgun at his
first-grade classmates will be transferred to another school after
undergoing psychological testing, officials say.
   ``Looking at the severity and the sadness ... the boy is in need
of some help. I intend to pursue psychological testing,'' John A.
Stewart, Polk County school superintendent, said Wednesday.
   The outcome of the evaluation will determine whether he is sent
to a school for children with emotional problems, said Bill Duncan,
who oversees discipline for Polk County schools.
   Crystal Lake Elementary School Principal W. James Pace sent a
letter home with students Wednesday, informing parents of a
sheriff's investigation and assuring them their children were safe
at school.
   ``It is also not fair to blame the school because this
happened,'' he wrote. ``This could happen at any school.''
   The boy, who told investigators he brought the handgun from
home, was suspended immediately after the Sept. 12 incident,
Stewart said.
   He apparently pulled the gun from his knapsack twice, once after
a gym class and again after school. There reportedly were some
sexual remarks shouted at a girl followed by angry banter between
the boy and another boy, Stewart said.
   He also carried two bullets, but they were too large to fit the
gun, which authorities described as a derringer.
   After receiving reports from investigators, Stewart said he was
particularly disturbed by the ``level of violence and strange level
of knowledge of sexual behavior at such an early age.''
   ``We need to see what is at the root of the problem,'' Stewart
added.
   The boy and others from the group were questioned Wednesday to
determine what happened. Stewart said he will study results of that
closed, fact-finding session before making any decisions.
   ``Expulsion may not be the best approach with a boy this age _
he wouldn't learn anything by expulsion,'' said Stewart.
   Sheriff Detective Paul Baggett said the boy may have made a
derogatory sexual statement to a girl while the children were
walking home, but his statement was not a demand for sexual favors,
as some officials had reported earlier.

<HEAD>Officer Called to Help Save Choking Baby Two Nights in a Row</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEYMOUTH, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Weymouth Police Officer Tony Giorgi is
ready for anything in the line of duty _ especially choking babies.
He's saved two on back-to-back nights by coaching mothers over the
telephone.
   Giorgi, who helped save one baby Monday night, said he couldn't
believe it when a call came in Tuesday night from another panicky
mother.
   ``I thought it was a joke,'' Giorgi said. ``I couldn't believe
it was happening again.''
   Mark Landry was feeding formula to his 12-day-old daughter Elise
when she vomited and began to turn red. Landry's wife, Karen,
called police.
   While an ambulance was dispatched, Giorgi coached Mrs. Landry on
how to help dislodge the food caught in the baby's throat.
   ``I heard something and I said, `Is that the baby crying?' The
mother was still upset, but I knew that as long as she (the baby)
was crying, she was breathing. I told them we were out of the
woods,'' Giorgi said.
   The child had apparently choked on thick formula in her throat.
She was taken to South Shore Hospital and released.
   Monday night, Giorgi helped save 6-month-old Kelly Bobo, who was
choking on a clothing tag. Giorgi told the baby's mother, Susan
Bobo, over the phone how to fish the tag out of the baby's mouth
with her finger.
   Giorgi, 40, said saving the babies has renewed him after a
period of personal and professional turmoil.
   During a leave from 1984 to 1986, Giorgi was indicted, tried and
acquitted on charges connected to a Weymouth drugstore break-in. He
is now a department dispatcher.

<HEAD>Saw Maung Meets Opposition, Asks Help In Preparing For Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SEIN WIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new military ruler, Gen. Saw Maung,
says the army does not intend to hold onto power and has asked
opposition leaders to help restore peace and prepare for free
elections, the opposition said today.
   Saw Maung made his remarks in a letter to pro-democracy
activists Aung Gyi, Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin Oo. A copy of the
letter was shown to The Associated Press today.
   The activists sent the general a letter Tuesday calling for
dialogue to resolve the crisis that erupted after he seized power
in a coup Sunday, toppling civilian President Maung Maung.
   Saw Maung is the third head of Burma's government in two months.
   By official count, troops have killed at least 144 people since
the coup. A Western ambassador said the actual death toll may be as
high as 400.
   Rangoon was calm today with no street demonstrations for the
third consecutive day, after daily demonstrations the past two
months.
   The government has described the dead as looters and
``destructive elements,'' but the ambassador said many of them were
unarmed, peaceful protesters demanding democracy.
   In a reply letter Wednesday, Saw Maung did not directly respond
to the call for dialogue. He asked for help in restoring law and
order and preparing for the polling that Maung Maung had promised.
Saw Maung has not given any date for the elections, the first under
a multiparty system since 1960.
   The letter said:
   ``The army has no intention to retain the duties of state power
for a long time, in addition to its existing onerous duties. We had
to step in unavoidably because of the deteriorating general
conditions in the country. ...
   ``We promise you that free and fair general elections will be
held as soon as peace and tranquility is restored in the country,
and we hope you will cooperate with us to achieve this objective.
   ``Arrangements will be made to permit the use of government
radio and television by the political parties before the election
takes place.''
   Saw Maung was named prime minister Wednesday, after having
become both defense and foreign affairs minister in the nine-member
cabinet formed the day before. Six ministers are among the 18 top
military officers who helped the 59-year-old career officer seize
power.
   In Rangoon, more roadside shops were open than the previous day,
but larger markets remained closed. The doors of government offices
were open, but no one was working. Most public employees have been
on pro-democracy strikes since Aug. 8.
   Sketchy reports received today from Mandalay, the second-largest
city, and other towns indicated there was fighting earlier this
week between security forces and protesters, though not as fierce
as in the capital.
   Opposition leaders had succeeded in keeping the protests
peaceful, but that changed after Sunday's coup.
   Mobs have attacked government targets with weapons seized from
police stations and other places. One group opened fire with a
grenade launcher and automatic weapons late Tuesday at soldiers
guarding the City Hall and the main government administration
building in downtown Rangoon.
   The past two months of turmoil began after long-time strongman
Ne Win resigned in late July and widespread riots flared against
hard-liner Sein Lwin, his successor. Sein Lwin resigned Aug. 12.
   Maung Maung became on Aug. 19 the first civilian leader since
1962 and promised elections that would end the exclusive rule of
the Burma Socialist Program Party. But the opposition rejected that
plan and protests persisted to demand an interim government to
conduct the balloting.
   Diplomats say Saw Maung, like Sein Lwin and Maung Maung, is a
close associate of Ne Win and the coup may have been staged to
preserve the ruling military autocracy.
   Ne Win's coup ended Burma's brief experiment with democracy and
began a quarter century of rigid, inept central planning that
ruined the economy of one of the Asian countries most richly
endowed in natural resources.
   Burma, once the world's largest rice exporter, last year joined
40 other countries officially designated by the United Nations as
``least developed nation.''

   Two of the Hunt brothers who once shared one of
the world's wealthiest legacies have filed for personal bankruptcy
protection, their latest attempt to recover from an alleged scheme
to corner the world silver market.
   Nelson Bunker and William Herbert Hunt filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy reorganization Wednesday because of a court's
requirement that they post a $225 million bond to appeal their loss
in a New York federal court, said Tom Whitaker, a spokesman for the
brothers.
   A federal jury decided Aug. 20 that the two Hunts and brother
Lamar Hunt must pay more than $130 million in damages to Minpeco
SA, the Peruvian government's mineral marketing company.
   The company alleged in its civil suit that the brothers
conspired in the late 1970s with Middle Eastern businessmen in a
failed attempt to corner the silver market, ruining Minpeco's
investments.
   A U.S. District Court judge has temporarily stayed the bond.
   ``Given that Bunker Hunt was at one time one of the wealthiest
men in the world, it's absurd to imagine they've come to this
point,'' Thomas Gorman, trial attorney for Minpeco, told The Dallas
Morning News.
   The Hunts also face class-action suits in New York on behalf of
more than 17,000 silver futures traders who lost money when silver
prices crashed in early 1980. In addition, the Commodities Futures
Trading Commission has proposed an $80 million fine against the
brothers.
   The brothers' separate bankruptcy filings, which could have the
effect of blocking such lawsuits, list substantial assets but no
dollar figures.
   The Hunts said raising $225 million in the Minpeco case would
force a ``fire sale'' of assets, and would result in non-payment to
business and personal creditors.
   The Hunts also said they chose bankruptcy to keep Minpeco
attorneys from beginning foreclosure on their assets until their
appeal can be made.
   Hunt attorney Bob Wolin said the case may not even reach the
appeal stage. He said he has ``six or seven separate motions'' that
could either reduce the damages substantially, bring about a
judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or force a new trial.
   ``It's very winnable,'' Wolin said.
   In brief summaries of their assets in the petitions, Herbert
Hunt listed 13,649 Byzantine coins, a 44-piece Roman and Greek
bronze collection, a half-interest in a ski lodge in Vail, Colo.,
between one-third and one-fourteenth interest in 3,442 acres in
Louisiana, a 3-year-old Cadillac and a 15-year-old Mercedes Benz,
the Morning News said.
   Bunker Hunt listed ancient coins, art objects, bronze statues,
oil and gas properties in 40 counties nationally, three gas plants,
14 ranches, 1,390 acres of undeveloped land, a condo in Hawaii,
five cars and other assets.
   Both brothers listed the IRS and Minpeco as unsecured creditors
with a miniscule $1 disputed claim. They also listed Manufacturers
Hanover Trust Co. as an unsecured creditor owed $36 million. The
New York bank filed suit Friday in Dallas attempting to collect on
the 4-year-old note.
   The bankruptcy filing is the latest chapter in the Hunts'
struggle to hang on to what is left of the fortune they inherited
from their father, Texas oilman H.L. Hunt.
   Heavy losses in silver, oil and real estate cut the trio's
wealth from more than $5 billion to an estimated $1 billion,
according to the Dallas Times Herald. The brothers' trust funds
subsequently filed for bankruptcy.
   Last Friday, a federal bankruptcy judge approved a
reorganization plan to settle $750 million in loans and pull the
trust funds out of Chapter 11.
   The plan called for turning their financially strapped Penrod
Drilling Co., which is not in bankruptcy, into a corporation
jointly controlled by creditor banks.
   That plan was part of a settlement aimed at ending litigation
between the Hunts and the banks, which the Hunts claimed were
trying to force them out of business by refusing to renegotiate
$1.5 billion in loans.
   The agreement called for the brothers to pay $53.8 million in
cash and surrender real estate to resolve $200 million in debt.
   Placid Oil Co., owned by the Hunt trusts, also is in Chapter 11
bankruptcy. The trusts had offered in July to pay $803.5 million to
Placid's lenders.

   Some 48,000 scissors desk sets that could pose
a hazard to children are being recalled by K mart Corp., the
Consumer Product Safety Commission announced today.
   The ``School Days Scissors Desk Set,'' includes a razor blade
cutting knife that could pose a danger to children, the agency
said. The set sold for less than $1 in K mart stores during July
and included the scissors, pencil sharpener and the cutting knife.
   Parents should remove the set from use by children and return it
to the nearest K mart for a refund, the commission said.

   One victim of a double homicide used a tube
of white grease and the bloody floor of his kitchen to scrawl out a
name before he died, authorities said.
   Richard Valdez, 25, squeezed grease onto the floor and wrote the
letters ``JFF BOPE,'' according to an affidavit for the arrest of
Jeff J. Boppre, 25, a Scottsbluff resident whose whereabouts is
unknown to police.
   The message was found next to Valdez's body and the tube of
grease was found partly underneath his body Monday, the affidavit
said.
   Valdez's father said Valdez told family and friends that someone
was out to kill him, and he had vowed to leave a message behind if
he died.
   ``He told me if he was killed, he would write his name in his
own blood _ he'd write the name of the guy that did the shooting,''
Gilbert Valdez Sr. said.
   The warrant for Boppre's arrest charges him with two counts of
first-degree murder in the shooting deaths of Valdez and Valdez's
girlfriend, Sharon Condon, 19. The victims were shot a number of
times with a small-caliber handgun, officials said. Ms. Condon was
six to seven months pregnant.
   The victims' bodies were found Monday in a house about 1{ miles
north of Scottsbluff, which is near the Wyoming border. Shell
casings found at the scene matched shell casings found at Boppre's
residence, officials said.
   The slayings may be drug-related, authorities said Wednesday.
   Scotts Bluff County Attorney Brian Silverman said Boppre and
Valdez had dealt with drugs in the past. In the house, police found
$11,000 in cash, more than 3 pounds of marijuana and a number of
small packets of cocaine worth about $3,000, the affidavit said.

   A Visa card applicant who replied, ``Maybe

a laugh when her card came with a second one imprinted with the
name Maube Later.
   But Citibank, which issued the card, wasn't laughing.
   ``Are you serious?'' bank spokeswoman Susan Weeks asked when
contacted about the incident by telephone in New York. Citibank is
the nation's largest bank and the world's biggest issuer of Visa
and MasterCard credit cards.
   ``I can't wait to hear the explanation on this,'' Ms. Weeks said
after vowing to get to the bottom of the incident.
   Doris Stokes, an assistant administrator at the Los Angeles
Junior Chamber of Commerce, said she wasn't the only one to chuckle
at the card. She said she had applied for the card by telephone
recently.
   ``I brought it down to work, and everybody there was in tears
laughing so hard about it,'' Ms. Stokes said.

<HEAD>Britain Expels Three Czech Diplomats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain today ordered the explusion of three Czech
diplomats, including two military attaches, for engaging in
``activities incompatible with their status.''
   The terse announcement by the Foreign Office was couched in the
diplomatic parlance for spying.
   The statement said the Czechoslovak ambassador, Jan Fidler, was
summoned to the Foreign Office this morning and told the three must
leave Britain within 14 days.
   The expelled diplomats were Maj. Bedrich Kramar, the assistant
military and air attache; Maj. Vlastmil Netolicky, a member of the
military attache's staff; and Paval Moudry, a member of the
commercial section.
   Britain last expelled Czech diplomats in 1984 when two were
ordered out, and Communist Czechoslovakia expelled two diplomats in
retaliation.
   Two other Czech diplomats had been ordered out the previous year.
   ``The foreign secretary (Sir Geoffrey Howe) wishes it to be
clearly understood that, while we wish to build up our relations
with Czechoslovakia, we are not prepared to relax our policy on the
sort of activities to which May. Kramar, Maj. Netolicky and Mr.
Moudry had engaged,'' the Foreign Office announcement said.
   A ministry spokesman refused to elaborate on the allegations
against the three envoys. Kramar and Moudry have been posted in
Britain since 1984, and Netolicky arrived in September 1985, the
Foreign Office said.
   The Foreign Office expelled three other diplomats recently for
offenses ranging from traffic violations to carrying guns.
   A Cuban diplomat was sent home this month along with Cuba's
ambassador for firing a gun at intelligence agents tailing him in a
London street. A Vietnamese envoy was expelled for pulling a gun on
demonstrators outside his embassy, and a Tunisian was expelled for
refusing to pay parking fines.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Seeking Attempted Murder Charge In Beating Of American</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors are seeking to step
up charges against confessed TWA hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi to
include a count of attempted murder of an American passenger, a
court spokesman said today.
   The Lebanese Shiite Moslem defendant already is on trial for
murder, air piracy and other charges stemming from the June 1985
ordeal in which a U.S. Navy diver was killed.
   Court spokesman Falk Thomas said that after recent dramatic
testimony from American passengers and crew members, Frankfurt
prosecutors have asked the court to include a charge of attempted
murder of American passenger Kurt Carlson.
   Witnesses have testified that Hamadi and his accused fellow
hijacker, Hassan Ezzeddine, mercilessly beat the Rockford, Ill.,
man during the hijacking that kept 39 Americans captive for 17 days.
   ``The prosecutor's office has asked the court to formally notify
Hamadi that his actions can be judged as attempted murder,'' Thomas
told The Associated Press in an interview.
   ``The court will still have to decide whether such a charge is
included,'' Thomas added. He said ``there is no time pressure'' for
the court to make such a decision.
   Thomas said that the maximum sentence for attempted murder is a
life prison term.
   In the latest testimony regarding Carlson, chief flight
attendant Uli Derickson on Wednesday described how Carlson was
attacked by both hijackers, and said that he lay quietly near the
cockpit.
   ``I was convinced he was dead, because I had to step over him
several times,'' the 44-year-old Mrs. Derickson said. ``But then I
touched him and he moved.''
   The flight attendant said she then told Hamadi of Carlson's
family, and Hamadi apologized to the beaten Army Reserve officer
saying ``I didn't mean to kill you.''
   Carlson survived the ordeal and has also testified at Hamadi's
trial about his beatings.
   On Wednesday, Mrs. Derickson broke down in sobs as she talked
about the lasting psychological impact of the hijacking.
   ``I can imagine everyone on that flight is suffering,'' she told
the court. ``I suffered deep psychological effects, and I am still
under therapy.''
   Hamadi, who prosecutors say is 24 years old, has admitted taking
part in the hijacking but has denied killing U.S. Navy diver Robert
Stethem of Waldorf, Md.
   But John Testrake, the pilot, testified last week that he
believed Hamadi was the hijacker who shot and killed Stethem.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport on Jan. 13, 1987, after
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.
   In the week following his arrest, two West Germans were
kidnapped in Beirut in a failed scheme to win his release.
Kidnappers have since released both West German hostages.
   In addition to murder and air piracy, Hamadi has also been
charged with hostage-taking, causing bodily harm and robbery. He
also is on trial on charges of smuggling explosives and use of
falsified documents stemming from his arrest at Frankfurt airport.
   The TWA jet was hijacked to Beirut on a flight from Athens in
June 1985.

   A tentative agreement that
would end a provincewide civil service strike over wages was
reached after nearly 15 hours of talks.
   ``It doesn't go all the way but it goes far enough that the
bargaining committee is prepared to recommend it to the
membership,'' union president John Shields said Wednesday. ``We
hope that we can get them back to work.''
   During the strike that began Saturday, about 27,000 of the
union's 29,000 members stayed out of work, closing government
offices and liquor stores.
   Mediator Don Munroe said he expected ratification to be
completed Saturday and workers back on the job by Monday.
   An exhausted Munroe told a late-night news conference Wednesday
that a three-year deal had been reached that includes a wage
increase of 5{ percent, retroactive to Aug. 1, and increases 5 and
5{ percent in the following two years.
   The deal came after Premier Bill Vander Zalm said there should
be more money for some provincial government employees. One Social
Services Ministry clerk with two children said issues welfare
checks larger than her pay to families the same size as hers.
   During the strike, the Social Services Ministry opened an
emergency center in Vancouver to handle urgent cases. Regular mail
delivery of welfare checks wasn't affected.
   Prison guards and some health-care workers, considered to be
essential services, stayed on the job.

   A boy believed to be the youngest

   Two-year-old Nicholas Morgan of San Bernardino was reported in
critical but stable condition at the center today, two days after
the operation. He was described as ``awake and alert and talking,''
said a nursing supervisor who declined to give her name.

   Calm prevailed today in a tense,
impoverished neighborhood where rioting by hundreds of blacks was
triggered by an interracial, drug-related killing.
   Neighborhood school officials said today that classes would be
open, although absences would be excused if parents wished to keep
their children home.
   The almost exclusively black area known as Cedar Grove became
the province of rioters and looters for about five hours Tuesday
night and early Wednesday after a black man was killed by a white
woman shopping for cocaine, according to police and witnesses. At
least one witness said the victim was a bystander.
   Less intense violence surfaced again Wednesday night in the
state's second-largest city, despite pleas for calm by black
ministers and politicians. Police detoured traffic when cars
passing by the neighborhood were pelted with rocks, bricks and
bottles. Then they sealed off a 12-block area when gunshots were
heard.
   At least one fire was set in the area, but a crowd of about 200
youths began to disperse by midnight.
   ``It's mostly a very calm situation,'' Mayor John Hussey told
reporters when police began to withdraw around midnight, leaving
heavy patrols to investigate scattered reports of gunfire. ``Most
of the area I saw was still secure.''
   The riot was centered near a park where police said dealers
provided ``curb-service crack.''
   Ten years ago, the neighborhood was a mixed-race working-class
area, but it has become increasingly poor, violent and dangerous,
authorities said. Vacant buildings give the appearance of a war
zone and drug dealers have intimidated the elderly and families.
   High teen-age unemployment and a feeling that police had failed
to provide equal protection for blacks have made the area ``a time
bomb waiting to explode,'' said state Sen. Greg Tarver, a black
former city councilman.
   ``You can come through here any time, get robbed, get cut, get
shot,'' added Richard Kenner, a policeman who has patrolled Cedar
Grove from midnight to dawn the past seven years. ``There'll be 100
people standing around and nobody saw anything.''
   There were no arrests or injuries Wednesday night, but the
windshield of a pickup truck containing three whites was shattered
in three places and its passenger-side window was smashed out.
   Officials said the trouble was triggered by the Tuesday night
slaying of William David McKinney, 20, who lived in the
neighborhood. A witness said McKinney just happened to be standing
nearby when Tamala C. Vergo, who was shopping for cocaine, opened
fire on some men who snatched her purse.
   Vergo, 17, was being held today on a charge of second-degree
murder, police said. Another woman, apparently a companion, was
questioned but no charges were filed, said police Cpl. E.T. Rushing.
   At least five blacks were arrested during the rioting on
misdemeanor charges ranging from inciting a riot to resisting
arrest, police said. Some of them also were booked for looting. All
remained in jail today.
   Reporters at the scene said some of the rioters shouted ``Hot
Biscuit,'' the name of an all-night restaurant where a white
teen-ager shot a black teen-ager to death on Aug. 4. When arrested,
the admitted gunman claimed he acted in self-defense.
   The mayor and Police Chief Charles Gruber, along with black
political and religious leaders, appealed for calm after a meeting
Wednesday.
   Hussey and the Rev. E. Edwards Jones, a local pastor and
president of the National Baptist Convention of America Inc.,
agreed problems run deep throughout Shreveport's black community.
   ``We've got problems in our economy, we've got problems in our
racism, we've got many other problems,'' Hussey said.
   Hussey said the strategy again Wednesday night was to wait out
the troublemakers. By 11:30 p.m., scores of police cars, a busload
of camouflaged Special Response Team officers and canine units were
withdrawn from a command post at a nearby elementary school.
   Police remained stationed at two major intersections and beefed
up patrols to investigate scattered but unconfirmed reports of
gunfire and fires well after midnight.
   Gruber refused to give details about the investigation into the
riot or the shooting that preceded it.
   The chief said a brick was thrown through the windshield of his
own car and shots were fired through the back passenger door, but
he was not hurt. A KTBS-TV news car was burned and a new fire
department pumper was attacked with bats and bricks.
   A man who identified himself only as Charles, a cousin of
McKinney's, said McKinney was shot at random after a woman tried to
buy some cocaine from a group of men and was robbed. When they ran
away with her purse, she ``took out her frustration'' on McKinney,
he said.
   The man talked to reporters after being interviewed by
detectives as a witness to the shooting. Police would not comment
on his story.

   A former senior aide to Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega says Vice President George Bush met with Noriega five years
ago and complained about money laundering in Panama, according to a
British television documentary.
   The assertion by Col. Roberto Diaz Herrera contradicts Bush
claims that the Reagan administration took action against Noriega,
Panama's de facto leader, as soon as it learned that Noriega was
allegedly involved in drugs.
   Norieiga was indicted in federal court on drug charges in
February and U.S. sanctions began against him early this year.
   A spokesman for the vice president said Bush met with Panama's
then-President Ricardo de la Espriella and other officials,
including Noriega, in Panama in 1983. But, he added, ``There is
nothing to indicate the vice president spoke with Noriega.''
   James Baker, chairman of Bush's presidential campaign, responded
to questions about the matter on CBS ``This Morning'' today.
``You're going to hear a lot of rumors and specualation as this
campaign moves through its last 47 days,'' he said.
   Diaz and Jose I. Blandon, a former senior intelligence officer
in Panama, also said Noriega claims to have pictures and tape
recordings that would link Bush or his aides to secret training of
Nicaraguan rebels.
   From October 1984 to October 1986, U.S. law prohibited any U.S.
government aid to the Contras in their fight to topple Nicaragua's
leftist Sandinista government. The documentary did not say when the
pictures were taken nor when the tape recordings were made.
   ``We have learned that as early as 1983 ... George Bush sat down
with Gen. Noriega to complain about th laundering of drug money in
Panama,'' reporter Julian Manyon said on the Thames Television
program, which was screened for reporters Wednesday.
   ``One of the vice president's concerns, according to Panamanians
who were there, was an estimated $3 billion of drug profits that
had already been laundered through Panama,'' Manyon said.
   Noriega was shown on the documentary saying he never met Bush
nor had any contact with him. ``Your source of information is
mistaken,'' he said.
   In Washington, Bush spokesman Steve Hart said Wednesday the vice
president spoke of drug interdiction efforts when he met with
Espriella during a stopover in Panama but did not speak of any
allegations against the general.
   ``The vice president dealt with Espriella. One of the topics
they discussed was money laundering in Panama,'' Hart said. ``They
also talked about drug interdiction efforts. ... There is nothing
to indicate the vice president spoke with Noriega.''
   Manyon said the meeting took place Dec. 10, 1983 at the VIP
lounge of Panama City's airport. According to a black-and-white
photograph shown of the gathering, Diaz attended the meeting.
   Manyon said the meeting raised ``important questions'' about
Bush's claims the administration acted as soon as it learned of
allegations against Noriega concerning the laundering of drug
profits.
   Diaz, who was interviewed in Venezuela, said he once saw Noriega
examining photographs which apparently showed Contras being
secretly trained in Panama under an arrangement with Col. Oliver
North, the White House aide dismissed over the Iran-Contra scandal
in which profits from arms sales to Iran were allegedly funneled to
the Contras.
   Noriega suggested that the tapes and photos gave him an
advantage over Bush, according to Diaz, who has accused Noriega of
corruption, electoral fraud and political murder.
   In the TV interview, Blandon replied, ``Of course'' when asked
if he believed ``people inside the Bush campaign are aware of the
threat that Noriega poses for them'' by allegedly having tape
recordings about the illegal training of Contras.
   Blandon, a witness at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee
hearing investigating Noriega, said the general has sent a message
to Bush campaign officials that he has the tape recordings.
   Hart said it was no secret the vice president was in Panama in
1983.
   ``George Bush was down in Argentina for the inauguration of
President (Raul) Alfonsin. He did a refueling stop in Panama and he
met with President de la Espriella at the airport,'' Hart said.
``One of the persons in the group was Noriega, who was there to
represent the Defense Forces.
   As for any picture showing Bush and Noriega together, Hart said,
``When you meet with people in a meeting, you go around and shake
hands.''
   The documentary was to be broadcast tonight on Britain's
commercial Independent Television Network.

   Hundreds of chanting, flag-waving
Slavic students called a school strike today and marched around the
capital of ethnically troubled Kosovo, protesting alleged
harassment by Albanians.
   About 1,000 teen-agers marched behind the red, blue and white
flag of Yugoslavia's largest republic, Serbia, after going to four
schools to declare a boycott of classes and collect supporters for
their protest.
   Plainclothes police kept a close watch, but there was no atempt
to interfere and uniformed police stopped traffic on the main
thoroughfare to allow the marchers to pass.
   The march illustrated the high level of tension in this city of
200,000.
   ``We are afraid to go to school,'' said the students when youth
officials tried to persuade them to return to class.
   On Tuesday night, about 5,000 Serbs and Montenegrins, both
Slavs, rallied after a Serbian girl allegedly was attacked by an
ethnic Albanian Monday night.
   That rally was one of the latest in a series of meetings backing
Serbian Communist Party leader Slobodan Milosevic, who wants more
control over Serbia's two autonomous provinces of Vojvodina and
Kosovo.
   Kosovo, one of Yugoslavia's poorest and most backward regions,
has a history of ethnic tension between Serbs and Montenegrins, who
see the province as their historic homeland, and the Albanians, who
now make up about 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people.
   In 1981, ethnic riots left at least nine dead and prompted
federal authorities in Belgrade to impose martial law for a few
weeks.
   Kosovo's Albanians have not yet staged any public protests in
response to the current wave of Slav rallies. But Serbs allege
individual harassment by Albanians have increased and nervous
residents in both ethnic groups report tension at a high level.
   Federal authorities dispatched extra police units, equipped with
armored pesonnel carriers, to Kosovo earlier this month.
   Today's protest started when about 200 Slav teenagers walked up
the central downtown street, chanting ``Kosovo is Serbia,'' and
``We will give our lives, but we will not give Kosovo.''
   Some participants said the march was sparked by the alleged rape
attempt Monday night, but others said there had been fresh trouble
Wednesday involving a fight between Albanian and Serbian students.
   A worried Serbian mother, who did not identify herself, sobbed
outside one school: ``Children should not solve problems. I have a
child in there. I am afraid.''
   A Serbian woman, looking at the march, said, ``What will happen
now? Albanian kids know who is marching and they could do
something.''

   A deranged man ran naked into St. Patrick's
Cathedral, then killed an elderly usher and seriously injured a
police officer with an iron prayerbook stand before being shot and
killed by police, officials said.
   The 250-pound attacker, identified as Jorge DelGado, 32, of
Manhattan, had attended morning Mass celebrated by Cardinal John
O'Connor prior to Wednesday's attack and stood directly before the
cardinal as he administered the Holy Eucharist, O'Connor told
reporters.
   ``I felt he was totally disoriented. The cathedral is a magnet
for all people. People sleep in it and engage in the strangest
behavior in the cathedral. I patted him on the shoulder and said,
`God bless you.' He stood for a moment and left,'' O'Connor said.
   O'Connor performed a purification rite before the 8 a.m. Mass
today. The Rev. Peter Finn, a spokesman, said the rite is performed
``whenever a sacred place has been violated and profaned.''
   It was the first time the rite was performed in the 109-year
history of the cathedral.
   ``While the cathedral has been desecrated, while this
magnificent temple of almighty God, famous throughout the world,
has been violated, we must not forget that two men were killed here
last night,'' the cardinal told several hundred people who attended
the morning service.
   ``It is for their souls I will be offering this Mass, as well as
for the purification of the cathedral,'' the cardinal said.
   Wednesday evening, the man tore off all his clothes down the
street from the historic midtown cathedral, walked one block to the
church, chanting under his breath and carrying red carnations,
according to witnesses.
   ``He suddenly stopped, stripped, and headed up the street. He
was obviously disturbed,'' said a witness, Scott Lucas, 56. ``He
was not aware of anybody else.''
   Upon entering the church he repeatedly struck a woman praying in
a pew, ripped the prayer book stanchion from the marble floor where
it was bolted near the front altar, and then used it to strike and
kill the 77-year-old usher, John Winters, and wound officer James
McMann, police and witnesses said.
   ``Everyone backed away. Then the cops rushed in. (The woman) was
screaming very loud that she was getting hit and needed help. But
everyone was running away from her. We ran,'' said another witness,
Luis Gonzalez of Brooklyn.
   About six or seven people were present as the man began to
attack the woman, said Thomas Clark of Queens. ``He starts hitting
her with his hand and he starts punching her.''
   Clark said that after the woman ran out of the church he told
the police officer that ```a man is running around nude in the
church, by the altar now and he's unarmed.' And the cop tries to
convince him to leave.'''
   Meanwhile, the attacker ``picks up a metal stand and starts
swinging it around, go wild crazy, and he hits the cop a couple of
times,'' Clark said.
   A backup police unit arrived and shot the attacker once in the
chest, killing him, said Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell, a police
spokesman. He fell to the floor in a center aisle, police said.
   The 3-foot-long metal stanchion was found about 7 feet away from
him, said Detective Joseph Gallagher.
   Winters, a Queens resident, died inside the front rail of the
altar near the pulpit, police said. He suffered a large gash to the
head, Gallagher said.
   McMann, 50, suffered a head injury that did not appear to be
life-threatening, said Police Capt. Richard Valentine. He was in
serious but stable condition early today at Bellevue Hospital, said
Nick Marletta, a hospital administrator.
   The woman's identity and her injuries were not immediately
known, police said.
   The cardinal said the man allegedly had committed acts of minor
vandalism in and around the church in the past.
   ``Two people are dead and a police officer is seriously
wounded,'' the cardinal said. ``There is no tragedy comparable to
that. It's very serious to me and all Catholics.''
   Mayor Edward I. Koch, who embraced O'Connor at the conclusion of
a news conference outside the cathedral, said, ``We are very lucky
he didn't assault the cardinal.''

   Student demonstrators today burned
effigies of Americans and persisted with demands that the Olympic
Games be shared with rival North Korea.
   About 1,700 students from 12 universities in the capital took
part in the demonstration at Yonsei University to demand the
communist north be allowed to co-host the Games, which began
Saturday and end Oct. 2
   The International Olympic Committee has ruled the Games cannot
be shared because they are given to a single city.
   The students also called for expulsion of U.S. forces from South
Korea. The United States has 42,000 troops based in South Korea
under a mutual defense treaty. The Korean peninsula has been
divided since 1945.
   ``Oppose dictatorial Olympics!'' the students yelled.
   Two thousand riot police wearing combat fatigues and black
visored helmets blocked the way when the students marched to the
school gate and appeared ready to move to the streets. The
students, however, stayed inside the campus, and no confrontation
occurred.
   Chanting slogans and raising their fists in the air, the
students marched around the campus as speakers called for a drive
to force out the U.S. soldiers stationed in South Korea.
   Protesters burned figures with U.S. and Japanese flags painted
on them. ``Yankee go home!'' students yelled. They charge the
United States and Japan are helping strengthen authoritarian rule
in South Korea.
   Speakers also claimed the Olympics heightened the risk of war on
the divided Korean peninsula. U.S. forces in South Korea are on
increased alert against possible threats from North Korea during
the Games, and U.S. and Japanese naval forces are helping patrol
the surrounding seas.
   Huge placards hanging down the sides school buildings read
``Oppose the Olympics, which perpetuate the national division'' and
``No war and no nuclear bombs.''
   In a related development, President Roh Tae-woo said today he
has not decided yet whether to accept North Korean President Kim Il
Sung's proposal for talks with him because the proposal contains
``something unclear and ambiguous.''
   ``I will have my position known after scrutinizing the real
intention of North Korea,'' Roh said in an interview with The
Joongang Daily News, a Korean language national newspaper.
   The summit, if held, would be the first between the two Koreas.

<HEAD>Wright Defends Himself Against Charges He Improperly Disclosed CIA
Operation</HEAD>

   House Speaker Jim Wright defended himself
today against charges that he improperly disclosed a covert CIA
operation in Nicaragua as Republican leaders formally asked for an
investigation of his actions.
   ``I haven't revealed anything that was committed to me as secret
or classified,'' Wright told a reporter. ``I am not a member of the
(House) Intelligence Committee. I have not been present at the
secret, classified briefings. I have simply said what is generally
known and what is true.''
   But Wright, D-Texas, declined to specifically say how he had
learned of the covert operation in Nicaragua, or whether he had
been told of it informally by an Intelligence Committee member.
   Wright on Tuesday said he had received ``clear testimony'' from
the CIA that the agency had fomented opposition demonstrations in
Nicaragua to provoke the leftist Sandinista government and sabotage
peace talks. He told a reporter later that CIA officials had made
the admission under congressional questioning.
   He repeated the assertion to reporters today, noting that the
Reagan administration had not disputed it.
   ``In late August of last year I became aware that elements of
the U.S. government were seeking to ... foment disturbances with a
view to seeing if they could provoke'' the Sandinistas into a
crackdown that would derail peace talks, Wright said.
   ``That seems to me just intolerably two-faced,'' he said. Wright
added that he had been given ``indirect assurance'' that the
practice has now been halted.
   To bolster his case that the CIA activity already was well
known, Wright distributed a list of news stories that document
agency activity in Nicaragua. The list included past CIA actions
such as mining Nicaraguan harbors, secretly resupplying the Contra
rebels and supporting opposition groups, but contained no specific
mention of covert efforts at fomenting civil unrest and
demonstrations.
   Meanwhile, House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., and Rep.
Dick Cheney, R-Wyo., chairman of the House Republican Conference,
asked for an investigation of Wright's actions in letters late
Wednesday to the House ethics and intelligence committees.
   ``Because of the possibility such a disclosure (of classified
information) may have occurred, we are writing to ask your
committee to promptly and thoroughly investigate the circumstances
surrounding these events and to recommend appropriate action to the
House of Representatives,'' Michel and Cheney said in a letter to
ethics committee chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif.
   In a separate letter to Rep. Louis Stokes, D-Ohio, chairman of
the House intelligence panel, they asked for an immediate meeting
of the committee ``to discuss these matters, to ascertain whether
any unauthorized disclosures have in fact occurred and to decide on
an appropriate course of action.''
   House Republicans were meeting today to discuss the Wright
matter and in particular to weigh its implications for legislation
that would tighten congressional control over the CIA's covert
activities.
   The Reagan administration opposes the bill, which is scheduled
for floor consideration next week. A version already has been
passed by the Senate, where sponsor William Cohen, R-Maine, rose on
the floor today to chastise Wright.
   ``CIA people do not testify in open session,'' Cohen said.
``There is the clear implication that the speaker's statement could
only have been derived from classified information in the
possession of the House Intelligence Committee. Where did he obtain
this information? On what basis did the speaker believe he had the
privilege to speak to reporters about this classified information?''
   Cohen said while the legislation may still be passed by the
House next week, Wright's disclosure makes it less likely
proponents will be able to muster the votes to override an almost
certain presidential veto.
   ``The fact he has made (the disclosure) is serious,'' said Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the senior Republican on the House Intelligence
Committee. ``I am astounded to hear Sandinista propaganda coming
out of the speaker's office.''
   Asked during a photo session Wednesday about Wright's comments,
President Reagan said, ``The reaction I have, and I think it should
fit the speaker also, there is no way we should talk publicly about
intelligence operations of any kind.''
   But he declined to confirm or deny the substance of the
speaker's disclosure, adding: ``If I start going down that road,
then I'm creating the same violation that he did.''
   ``We simply cannot comment on covert operations or intelligence
matters of this kind,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said. ``And sometimes that means having to accept information that
may or may not be true.''
   But Fitzwater told reporters that at the outset of a meeting
with the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Wednesday, Reagan remarked that
``there is nothing that we are doing anywhere that wasn't reviewed
and approved by the House and Senate intelligence committees.''
   ``That's an important point,'' Fitzwater said, ``because if
Wright has a problem, he ought to take it up with the intelligence
committees.'' He added that Wright ``has always been more than
eager to take the position of the Ortega government, but it's
impossible to say what the real damage might be in this case.''
   House rules stipulate that information given to the House
Intelligence Committee, which oversees the CIA nd other spy
agencies, is classified and may not be disclosed except under
certain tightly controlled circumstances. Unauthorized disclosure
is subject to investigation by the ethics committee.

<HEAD>Five-Alarm Fire In San Francisco</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A spectacular five-alarm fire roared
through a drug store under construction in the Haight-Ashbury
District today with heat so intense that paint on buildings across
the street caught fire, officials said.
   The blaze two blocks from Golden Gate Park sent flames and
embers into the pre-dawn sky and forced residents of several
apartments to flee. No injuries were reported.
   ``The wind was blowing so hard the fire was hopping the
street,'' said Jim Tonn, who lives a block from the fire. Tonn said
he fled about 4:30 a.m. when the heat and smoke awoke him.
   Two hours later, firefighters had reduced the blaze
considerably, with only spots of fire and heavy smoke remaining.
Arson investigators were at the scene, police said.
   The fire burned part of the I-Beam, a nightclub next to the drug
store. The buildings across the street whose paint caught fire had
broken windows but were not seriously damaged.
   A pickup truck and a car parked next to the three-story,
partially constructed drug store were also destroyed, said police
Sgt. Joyce Watkins.
   ``It was so hot we couldn't stand here,'' said Watkins,
referring to an area half a block from the blaze. Policemen who
arrived to evacuate nearby residents reported hairs on their arms
were burned.
   ``It (the fire) must have been going 40 to 50 feet in the air,''
said Jody Spencer, who liveslections
would be held as soon as peace was restored. Saw Maung seized power
in a coup Sunday, toppling civilian President Maung Maung, and
became prime minister Wednesday.
   ``We urge the government not to arrest people including the
monks, students, artists ... in connection with the recent unrest
and also to release those already under detention,'' said the
letter from opposition leaders Aung Gyi, Tin Oo, and Aung San Suu
Kyi.
   Since the coup, security forces have broken up protest centers
manned mostly by monks and students in at least 95 towns.
Government spokesman Kyaw San said Wednesday authorities arrested
100 looters in northern Rangoon on Tuesday but had no knowledge of
a reported roundup of student leaders.
   The opposition figures also urged Saw Maung to end his ban on
newspapers and announce a list of those killed by soldiers since
the coup.
   By official count, troops have killed at least 144 people since
the coup. A Western ambassador said the actual death toll may be as
high as 400.
   Rangoon was calm today, with no street demonstrations for the
third consecutive day after daily demonstrations the past two
months.
   More roadside shops were open than the previous day, but larger
markets remained closed. Government offices were open but
unstaffed, with most public employees continuing pro-democracy
strikes begun Aug. 8.
   Sketchy reports received today from Mandalay, the second-largest
city, and other towns said there had also been fighting between
security forces and protesters, though not as fierce as those in
the capital.
   The opposition leaders first wrote to Saw Maung Tuesday, calling
for dialogue to resolve the crisis. The next day they received Saw
Maung's letter, his first contact with the opposition figures.
   In his letter, Saw Maung did not directly respond to the call
for dialogue. He asked the opposition leaders' help in achieving
what he said were his government's objectives of restoring law and
order, improving living conditions and holding a general election.
   ``The army has no intention to retain the duties of state power
for a long time,'' said the letter, a copy of which was shown to
The Associated Press today. ``We had to step in unavoidably because
of the deteriorating general conditions in the country.''
   ``We promise you,'' the letter continued, ``that free and fair
general elections will be held as soon as peace and tranquility are
restored.''
   Saw Maung also said political parties will be allowed to use
radio and television for campaigning. He has not set a date for
elections.
   Burma has been ruled with an iron fist by the sole legal party,
the military-dominated Burma Socialist Program Party, since the
1962 coup that toppled an elected government. On Sept. 10, Maung
Maung bowed to massive street protests and agreed to hold
multiparty elections as soon as early October.
   But the opposition rejected that and continued street
demonstrations demanding that an interim government be formed to
conduct the balloting.
   A Western diplomat following events from Bangkok, Thailand, said
Saw Maung's letter may be an attempt ``to blunt the opposition by
taking them in.'' But he said it was significant that the general
had established dialogue with the opposition.
   Opposition leaders had succeeded in keeping the protests
peaceful, but that changed after Sunday's coup.
   Mobs have attacked government targets with weapons seized from
police stations and other places. One group opened fire with a
grenade launcher and automatic weapons late Tuesday at soldiers
guarding the City Hall and the main government administration
building in downtown Rangoon.
   The past two months of turmoil began after long-time strongman
Ne Win resigned in late July and widespread riots flared against
hard-liner Sein Lwin, his successor. Sein Lwin resigned Aug. 12.
   On Aug. 19, Maung Maung became the first civilian leader since
1962.
   Diplomats say Saw Maung, like Sein Lwin and Maung Maung, is a
close associate of Ne Win and the coup may have been staged to
preserve the ruling military autocracy.
   Ne Win's coup ended Burma's brief experiment with democracy and
began a quarter century of rigid, inept central planning that
ruined the economy of one of the Asian countries most richly
endowed in natural resources.

   Jane Fonda's exercise videotapes are back
on the shelves of a Naval submarine base store after the commanding
officer reversed a decision to remove them, a base spokesman said.
   Declaring that the tapes are not prejudicial to good order and
discipline, Capt. John Cox ordered that the store could again sell
them, Lt. Cmdr. John Ward said Wednesday.
   The tapes had been removed from the military store's shelves
after complaints about Fonda's anti-Vietnam War activities, Ward
said.
   Ward said while Cox was on leave, an officer ordered the tapes
removed from the shelves. When the captain returned, he ordered the
tapes put back. The tapes are not big sellers at the base, Ward
said.
   Groton resident John W. Pillar, who complained to Navy
authorities about the sale of the tapes, said he was ``very, very
disappointed'' by the decision.
   ``We don't feel she (Fonda) should be making money on the bodies
of the men who were lost over there, that is what it amounts to,''
Pillar said.
   This summer, Fonda apologized on national television to veterans
who may have been hurt by her actions during a 1972 visit to Hanoi
in which she was photographed with a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft
gun.
   Fonda's publicist, Stephen M. Rivers, declined comment Wednesday
night on the tapes.

   A fire broke out today aboard a North
Sea oil drilling vessel off Scotland's east coast, and supply
vessels evacuated all but two of the 67 people on board, the Royal
Air Force said.
   ``They're being evacuated, but two people are unaccounted for,''
said RAF Flight Lt. Simon Tonkin of Kinloss base, which monitors
coast guard operations in the North Sea.
   The Ocean Odyssey, a mobile, sdrilling rig
vessel, was operating about 100 miles east of Scotland when a fire
alert was sounded at 1:15 p.m. (9:15 a.m. EDT), Tonkin said.
   The vessel is operated by the Los Angeles-based Atlantic
Riemi-submersible chfield Co., Tonkin said.
   Supply vessels in the area picked up evacuated workers, and five
helicopters, a Royal Air Force reconnaisance aircraft and a British
warship were at the scene, he said.
   On July 6, explosions rocked the Piper Alpha oil platform in the
North Sea 120 miles off Scotland, killing 165 workers and two
would-be rescuers.
   Three-quarters of the platform sank, trapping many of the
victims. The operators, U.S.-based Occidental Petroleum, plan 3  .5974

   Republican George Bush's campaign will spend a
modern record of about 60 percent of its $54 million budget for
television advertising this fall, a Bush aide said today.
   Presidential campaigns traditionally set aside about half of
their federally restricted funds for paid media and the other half
for campaign organization.
   The Bush aide, who spoke only on condition that he not be
identified, said 60 percent or $32.4 million is ``a pretty accurate
figure, which would make it the largest television expenditure in
modern history.''
   The Washington Post, quoting an unnamed Bush aide, said the GOP
campaign is benefiting so much from the use of money raised by the
Republican Party for political activities that it can use a far
larger share for advertising.
   Both campaigns are limited by federal law to a $54 budget, with
$46 million coming from the federal treasury.
   Mark Gearan, a spokesman for Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis,
said Wednesday, ``I think we'll be competitive with the Bush
campaign, but beyond that we don't detail our spending.''
   He said the high amount spent by the Bush campaign is not
surprising ``in this market.''

   A new court decision may finally end a
23-year-old racial discrimination case filed by black workers at an
Alabama railroad car manufacturing plant.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling Wednesday
in the workers' case against Pullman-Standard Division of
Chicago-based Pullman Inc. The court gave a partial victory to the
workers, ordering a lower court to determine damages for workers
who suffered discrimination between 1965 and 1974 but ruling in
favor of the company in other aspects of the case.
   ``Few cases better represent the idea that the road to justice
can be a long and tortured one,'' Circuit Judge Thomas A. Clark
wrote in a prologue to the decision.
   Complaints of racial discrimination were first brought by the
workers shortly after President Lyndon Johnson signed legislation
that accommodated such claims.
   At the time, according to court documents, the factory in
Bessemer, Ala., was divided into 28 departments, some of them
integrated but many either all-white or all-black. The black jobs
paid less.
   In 1965, an arbitration decision opened up some jobs to blacks,
but Pullman stopped its on-the-job training program that enabled
many blacks to attain the skills needed to work at the plant.
   Four years later, Pullman entered into an agreement with the
Department of Labor to encourage blacks to move into the previously
all-white departments and develop a program of outside vocational
development.
   But several complaints of racial discrimination were filed with
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission between 1966 and 1969.
In 1972 the commission consolidated all the complaints and found
that Pullman had discriminated in hiring, promotion and job
assignments.
   Just before the commission's ruling, worker Louis Swint filed a
class-action lawsuit contending that Pullman practiced racial
discrimination, and the case went to trial in 1974. Swint won,
kicking off a litany of appeals, cross-appeals, trials and
reversals.
   In the meantime, Pullman closed its Bessemer plant in 1982,
putting some 3,500 people out of work. It was later purchased by
Trinity Industries and still makes railroad cars, employing about
600 people, said plant safety director Festus Pierce.
   Many of the original workers have since died, according to court
documents.
   Four trials were held on Swint's lawsuit, and the case made it
to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1982. After the fourth trial, in 1986,
both sides appealed once again to the 11th Circuit.
   Wednesday, the appeals court upheld a lower court's ruling that
Pullman's seniority system was not created or maintained in order
to further discrimination. The appeals court also said evidence
showed that discrimination in departmental assignments ended in
February 1969.
   But one issue was reversed in the workers' favor and sent back
to U.S. District Court in Birmingham, Ala., to determine damages.
The appeals court said Pullman should be held liable for any
discrimination occurring between October 1965 and January 1969 on
job assignments.
   In addition, it said Pullman is liable for discrimination in
promotions that happened between September 1966 and August 1974.

   A minister was convicted today of
killing and beheading a church handyman and setting the church on
fire in a bid to leave Nashville and establish a new identity.
   The Circuit Court jury deliberated three hours Wednesday night
and an hour this morning before finding John David Terry guilty of
murder and arson. The sentencing portion of the trial was to begin
later today.
   Terry, 43, looked calm as the verdict was read.
   He was accused of killing handyman James Chester Matheny,
cutting off the man's head and other parts of his body to make
identification difficult, and leaving the body in his Emmanuel
Church of Christ Oneness Pentecostal, which he then set on fire.
   Prosecutors said Terry killed Matheny, 32, in June 1987 in an
attempt to make it look as though he himself had been slain, so
that he could adopt a new identity and start a new life.
   Matheny's headless body was found in the ruins of the church,
but the head was never found. The exact cause of death was never
determined.
   In his closing argument, Assistant District Attorney General
John Zimmermann called Terry a calculating killer ``with ice in his
veins, not blood.''
   ``You may never hear of a more cold-blooded, brutal murder than
this one,'' Zimmermann said.
   Defense lawyer Lionel Barrett presented no witnesses on Terry's
behalf and did not make a closing statement, saying ``the real
trial will begin'' if the jury is asked to impose the death
sentence. Barrett said he planned to argue that Terry was suffering
from some sort of ``mental condition'' when Matheny was killed.
   Zimmermann argued that Terry began planning the crime early last
year, after receiving $50,700 from the sale of church property,
unknown to other church officials, and after learning that he would
not get a promotion he had expected.
   The prosecutor told the jury that Terry picked a name ``off a
tombstone'' of a child who died in 1951 and began assembling
identification papers in that person's name. The child had been
born three days before Terry in 1944.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission today
announced that it would take no action against those involved in
the sale and default of $2.25 billion worth of Washington Public
Power Supply System bonds.
   In a 376-page report on its five-year investigation, the
commission staff criticized several parties involved in the sale of
the bonds, which were issued to finance two nuclear power projects
that later were terminated.
   The report concluded that enforcement action was unnecessary
because of a civil trial, difficulty in determining responsibility
for disclosure statements attached to the bonds and concern that
the commission lacked the resources to pursue the case.
   Bondholders are suing 18 utilities that are members of WPPSS,
the construction arm of the state's public utilities system, plus a
financial adviser and two engineering firms in a trial that began
Sept. 1 in Tucson, Ariz.
   Most parties originally named as defendants in the suit,
including Washington Power itself, have settled out of court for a
total of $461 million, including $96 million in contested insurance
claims.
   The report concluded that the default, the largest in municipal
bond history, resulted from extensive cost overruns and
construction delays at Washington Power's Project No. 4 at the
Hanford nuclear reservation and No. 5 at Satsop, west of Olympia.
   The power company, which issued the bonds, was responsible for
the official statements used to sell them but ``avoided disclosure
of negative developments,'' the report said. ``Most significantly,
the supply system failed to disclose that, in October 1980,
participants, who were concerned about rising project costs and
falling power demands, asked the supply system to study a possible
slowdown or termination of the projects.''
   Work was halted on the projects in 1982, both were abandoned
later that year, and in 1983 WPPSS quit making payments on the
bonds after the Washington state Supreme Court held that the
utilities' contracts with the consortium were illegal and thus
unenforceable. Without payments from the 88 participating
utilities, many of them in other states, WPPSS defaulted.

<TEXT>
   Hurricane Helene is packing winds of 100 mph far
off in the Atlantic Ocean and heading toward the Americas, but
forecasters say it has a lot to prove before it should be
considered dangerous.
   At midday today, Helene was centered near latitude 13.2 north,
longitude 42.7 west, or about 1,125 miles east of Barbados and
2,500 miles east of Miami, about 100 miles closer than it was six
hours earlier, according to a National Hurricane Center advisory
issued just before noon.
   ``If it makes it all the way over to the west side of the
Atlantic, there's a chance it could become much more significant,
but it also has to go through a lot of wind patterns in the
atmosphere that could mess it up,'' said Randy Lascody, a
meteorologist at the center.
   The Atlantic hurricane season's eighth named storm was moving
west at 10 mph. It was expected to maintain that path for a day or
two, the advisory said.
   ``It's a long, long way from causing any problems,'' Lascody
said.
   A nominal hurricane about 250 miles wide, Helene is the first
hurricane to form since Gilbert, which reached that status rapidly
after it entered the Caribbean. Gilbert last week thrashed Jamaica,
the Cayman Islands, Mexico and the Texas Gulf Coast.
   Weather systems that form this month near the Cape Verde Islands
off Africa's coast, as Helene and Gilbert did, enjoy excellent
hurricane-spawning atmospheric conditions. They are often the
strongest of the six-month Atlantic storm season that begins June 1.
   ``The water's warm, the environment is favorable, conditions are
right for some additional strengthening,'' said forecaster Hal
Gerrish.
   Forecasters couldn't predict if Helene might become as fierce as
Gilbert, described as the century's most intense hurricane in terms
of barometric pressure. The hurricane center expected to send a
reconnaissance plane to check Helene's growth on Saturday when the
storm is closer, Gerrish said. Until then, forecasters will rely on
satellite reports.
   ``This hurricane could do any of a number of things, but
typically in this part of the ocean they don't strengthen too much
until they get closer to the Windward Islands,'' Lascody said.
   Tropical depressions _ winds swirling around a warm core of low
pressure _ are named as storms when top sustained winds hit 39 mph,
and reach hurricane status when top sustained winds hit 74 mph.
   Besides Gilbert, which packed top winds of 175 mph, two small
hurricanes formed this season. Debbie brushed the Mexican coast,
and Florence moved over Louisiana.

   Radio Moscow said today that protesters attacked a
prosecutor's office in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh,
which officials have sealed off and put under curfew because of
ethnic unrest.
   One person was reported killed and 48 injured in clashes between
Armenians and Azerbaijanis.
   Soldiers cordoned off streets and checked identification papers
today in Nagorno-Karabakh and the Armenian capital of Yerevan.
   A strike in the territory closed schools, transportation and
many state-run enterprises and public gatherings were banned, the
radio said.
   ``There are soldiers on every street, at every crossroad,
checking passports and personal cars,'' said a man who answered the
telephone at the state radio and television office, Gostelradio, in
Nagorno-Karabakh's main city of Stepanakert.
   ``The situation is not improving. It has become even more
threatening,'' Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev
said at a news briefing in Moscow.
   Perfiliev said an Armenian man was killed and 48 people were
injured in clashes in Nagorno-Karabakh. Thirty-two of the injured
were Armenians and 16 were Azerbaijanis, the spokesman said. More
than 30 buildings had been burned down, Perfiliev said.
   The government closed Azerbaijan to foreign journalists today, a
day after barring travel to Armenia.
   Nagorno-Karabakh is a predominantly Armenian region of mainly
Moslem Azerbaijan. Armenians, most of whom are Christian, began
pressing in February for its transfer to Armenia.
   Blaming the violence on ``corrupt elements'' trying to distract
attention from Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms,
Perfiliev said ``such a situation, of course, cannot be tolerated.
We cannot allow anarchy and the undermining of the rights of
citizens under the Constitution.''
   In response, a 9 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew was imposed in Stepanakert,
although most people had been staying home voluntarily because they
feared more violence, said the man at Gostelradio. He said he was
an ethnic Armenian, but would not further identify himself.
   In Yerevan, soldiers blocked streets around government and
Communist Party buildings and protesters rallied to demand the
Armenian Supreme Soviet again consider annexation of the enclave,
an editor of the local Tass affiliate said in a telephone interview.
   One Stepanakert resident contacted by telephone from Moscow said
food stores, the newspaper and radio and television stations were
working, but that public transportation, schools and most other
workplaces were closed.
   The resident said no one knew how long the ``special status''
imposed on Nagorno-Karabakh and on the Agdam region of Azerbaijan
on Wednesday would last.
   The official news agency Tass said the mountainous enclave's
Stepanakert and Agdam regions were placed on a ``special status,''
lower than a state of emergency.
   In Copenhagen, Denmark, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
said the Kremlin was considering use of ``some emergency action''
to deal with the unrest. He did not elaborate.
   An editor at the official Armenian news agency Armenpress said
in a telephone interview from Yerevan that soldiers of the Internal
Affairs Ministry had taken up positions in the center of the
Armenian capital.
   Radio Moscow, reporting on the situation in Stepanakert, said
``an attack on the regional prosecutor's office was provoked.'' It
did not say when it occurred or give other details.
   The radio also reported several arson attack on cars and
scattered shooting. The radio said there were casualties, but gave
no numbers.
   Tass reported Wednesday that there had been no casualties in
violence Tuesday and Wednesday.
   Tass reported that protesters had insulted authorities and
humiliated Interior Ministry soldiers and police. It did not
provide details.
   The editor of Armenpress, the local Tass affiliate, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said soldiers of the Internal Affairs
Ministry had taken up positions in the Yerevan city center.
   ``There isn't any disorder, and there won't be,'' the editor
said.
   Ethnic tensions led to rioting in the Azerbaijani city of
Sumgait in February, when 32 people were killed. Some calm returned
after the national Supreme Soviet on July 18 turned down a request
by the Armenian parliament and rejected annexation.
   Arkady Volsky, a representative of the national Communist Party,
went on local television and radio to appeal for calm, Tass
reported.

<HEAD>Rhode Island Farmers No. 1 in Dollars per Acre</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California leads the nation in farm income,
but when the states are rated in terms of dollars earned per acre,
none comes close to Rhode Island.
   A new analysis by the Agriculture Department for 1987 earnings
said California's net farm income was more than $5.58 billion.
Rhode Island was reported in 47th place at $46.4 million. Alaska
was at the bottom with $14.9 million.
   But the comprehensive Agricultural Income and Finance report,
which was issued this week by the department's Economic Research
Service, also ranked the 50 states according to average net farm
income per acre.
   Rhode Island was at the top, averaging $636 per acre in 1987.
California was seventh at $174 per acre. And Rhode Island's
per-acre average income was almost double second-place Connecticut,
which was reported at $352 per acre.
   Wyoming was ranked 50th with an average net income of $2 per
acre in 1987, the report said. Nationally, the average was a net
income of $46 per acre.
   California also led in net income per farm _ ranches included _
in 1987, averaging $73,790 per operation. Arizona was second at
$71,492 per farm, although the state placed 30th in total net
income last year. Rhode Island was third at $61,924 per farm.
Nationally, the average was $21,286 per farm.
   ``Especially high net farm income per operation or acre reflects
high-valued or relatively perishable crop usually produced near
large metropolitan areas,'' the report said. ``Conversely, low net
income per operation or acre typically occurs where farms are
isolated or produce farm products which require a great deal of
land.''
   Rhode Island had approximately 750 farms averaging 97 acres
each, the report said. In contrast, last-place Wyoming had about
8,800 farms averaging 1,700 acres.
   ``The leading commodities for Rhode Island were greenhouse,
dairy products, eggs and potatoes,'' the report said. ``Such
high-value, labor and capital intensive products tend to be typical
of more populate states with small farms.''
   Rhode Island's four leading commodities accounted for 65 percent
of the state's total 1987 farm marketings. The value of
California's four leading commodities _ dairy products, cattle,
greenhouse and grapes _ accounted for 41 percent of total farm
marketings, by comparison.
   ``The mix of land, labor and capital resources required for
California's leading commodities is indicative of larger farms
compared to those in Rhode Island,'' the report said.
   Here are the 1987 state rankings, in order, for net farm income
per acre, in dollars per acre in the first column; the second
column shows the average net income per farm in those states:

   Tobacco farmers have a bigger harvest this
year, but old-crop inventories are smaller, meaning there will be a
reduced total supply in the 1988-89 marketing year, the Agriculture
Department says.
   ``Stocks entering the new marketing year likely will equal 2.85
billion pounds, about 14 percent lower than a year earlier,'' the
department's Economic Research Service said Wednesday in a new
outlook report. ``Although surpluses continue for some kinds and
grades, there are shortages for others.''
   Nationally, the 1988 tobacco harvest is up about 10 percent from
last year because of increased acreage and greater yields, due to
better weather for flue-cured and some other kinds of tobacco.
However, dry weather kept burley yields below normal, but those
still were up from last year's low levels.
   ``Prospects for world tobacco use next season indicate a small
increase in sales and use of cigarettes and unmanufactured
tobacco,'' the report said. ``U.S. tobacco use may increase from
1987-88's 1.66 billion pounds because of greater use of
domestically grown tobacco in U.S. cigarettes and higher cigarette
production.''
   The report said U.S. cigarette output this year is expected to
increase from 689 billion ``pieces'' in 1987 because of rising
exports.
   However, cigarette consumption among Americans 18 years and
older is expected to continue a long-term decline, dropping around
1.5 percent this year from an average of 3,196 cigarettes in 1987,
which was the lowest since World War II. Cigarette use peaked at
4,345 pieces _ about 217 packs of 20 cigarettes each _ in 1963.
   The cigarette use figures are estimates that include smokers and
non-smokers alike and are used as statistical comparisons from year
to year.
   Flue-cured sales began July 26, and by Sept. 15 growers had sold
nearly three-fifths of their anticipated 1988 marketings, the
report said. Even with the larger crop, market prices are near last
year's higher prices, averaging $1.545 a pound, less than half a
percent below the 1987 level.
   As of September, this year's flue-cured crop was estimated at
780 million pounds, up 13 percent from last year.
   This year's burley production is expected to be up 7 percent
from the small 1987 harvest and was estimated earlier this month at
449 million pounds.

   The American Civil Liberties Union has accused
University of Nevada-Reno officials of persistent discrimination
and said its refusal to allow a gay rodeo at a campus arena is just
the latest example.
   ``Face it, if you're not a friend of the university and if
you're in some minority group, you don't have a chance there,''
state ACLU Executive Director Shelley Chase said.
   Her office is working on six discrimination cases against the
school _ involving complaints based on sex, age, race and handicap
_ and has joined one lawsuit.
   Ms. Chase held a news conference Wednesday in front of the
Lawlor Events Center to protest the school's refusal to allow the
national gay rodeo championship finals to be held there Oct. 22-23,
despite organizers' successful efforts to raise an extra $9,600 to
cover expenses in advance.
   Donald Klasic, general counsel for the state university system,
denied the school and Lawlor wrongfully reneged on a verbal deal in
which officials agreed to hold the event if backers presented the
$9,600.
   ``The dates are taken for the basketball team to practice,''
Klasic said. ``This agreement was reached on Aug. 31 after it
appeared that the rodeo wouldn't be taking place.''
   ``There's not a word of truth (to the discrimination charges),''
he added. ``The coaches simply feel that the more time spent
practicing in Lawlor, the better the home court advantage.''
   Ms. Chase, however, said the basketball team normally defers to
scheduled events and practices elsewhere.
   ``It's just too much of a coincidence,'' she said. ``And we've
been trying to talk to them and they won't even return our calls
now.''
   On Monday, the International Gay Rodeo and Silver State Gay
Rodeo associations lost a court battle against Lawlor.
   A Washoe District Court judge ruled that the groups had verbally
modified a February written contract by agreeing to meet a
pre-payment schedule to cover expenses for parking, security and
other operating costs.
   But the rodeo organizers, who already had paid $7,300 to rent
the arena, could only raise about $2,200 of the expense money and
thus broke the contract, Judge William Forman said.
   Lawlor director Richard Linio told Forman the Oct. 22-23 dates
were still open. And Rod Sumpter, the attorney for the
associations, said Lawlo officials later said the stadium would
still hold the rodeo if the expense money were presented in advance.
   But when Sumpter told the university Tuesday that an anonymous
businessman had written a check for the additional money, officials
told him the stadium was booked, he said.
   Klasic said it was a simple mistake and Linio wasn't aware the
dates had already been taken by the team.
   Sumpter said his clients were continuing to look for a place in
Reno to hold the October finals, in which the top riders and ropers
from regional events compete.

   Sixty-year-old sedans and newer Porsches,
Maseratis and Corvettes will open their throttles along a 93-mile
stretch of remote Nevada highway this weekend in the nation's first
legal open-road race in decades.
   But the first Silver State Classic has no prize money, no ticket
sales and spectators are not encouraged, said race organizer and
two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Rodger Ward, president of Vintage
Racing Club in Redondo Beach, Calif.
   ``This is not a spectator event,'' said Ward, who won the 500
and the U.S. Auto Club championship in 1959 and 1962. ``This is a
speed event all the way and is made so people with vintage cars can
get them on the road and test them.
   ``No one will be allowed along the highways. Well, if people
want they can watch the race start or wait at the finish line.''
   ``There's really not much along the highway, mostly dirt roads,
some driveways and farms,'' Ward said. ``We'll have guards at all
32 highway access roads, though, so nobody gets it into their head
to get in the way.''
   That shouldn't be too difficult since the affected section of
Nevada 318 through the mostly flat White River Valley crosses no
other highways. Irrigation fields and distant ranch houses are the
only signs of human life.
   The Nevada State Department of Transportation, the Nevada
Highway Patrol and the Nye, Lincoln and White Pine county
commissions all had to give permission for the race, with the
access guards as a condition, Ward said. The federal government
didn't become involved because it is a state highway.
   Drivers are to start out at one-minute intervals Sunday from
Lund, a tiny eastern Nevada farming town best known for producing
one or two high school graduates each year.
   The faster cars racing southward will arrive about 45 minutes
later at the finish line in Hiko, the Lincoln County seat in the
late 1860s but now reduced to a ghost town 100 miles north of Las
Vegas.
   ``I don't anticipate the cars running flat out, but some will
get up there, going 160, 170,'' Ward said. ``These cars are made
for speed.''
   The older vehicles will travel more sedately and arrive a little
later. The cars will compete in five categories so the older ones
are not outclassed.
   ``A lot of the drivers are people who just have an interest in
vintage cars,'' said Ted Roberts of Burbank, Calif. ``Others, with
the faster cars, can take them out and really drive them. This is
the ultimate high-speed run down a public highway. And it's legal.''
   Roberts, music supervisor for the ``Matlock'' television series,
planned to drive the 1968 Javelin he drove in the Trans-Am series
in 1969 and 1970.
   Ward, who is not driving Sunday, said he would like to make the
race an annual event. It is financed by entry fees from $100 to
$250 depending on the type of car.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis chided Republican rival
George Bush today for once referring to Social Security as
``largely a welfare program,'' and promised never to use Social
Security trust funds to help balance the federal budget.
   ``You know, when election time rolls around, Mr. Bush likes to
say he is a great friend of older Americans,'' Dukakis told a
lunchtime crowd at a senior citizens center in Boston.
   ``Maybe he thinks we all have amnesia,'' the Democratic nominee
said. ``Because it was just over three years ago _ May 10, 1985 _
that George Bush cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate to deny
you a cost-of-living increase in your Social Security and to make
you pay more for your medical benefits. And Dan Quayle voted with
him and against you.''
   If elected, Dukakis said, he and vice presidential running mate
Lloyd Bentsen would ``stop the attack on Social Security and
Medicare and we'll stop it cold.''
   Accompanied by his 85-year-old mother, Euterpe, and New York
Gov. Mario Cuomo, the Massachusetts governor said the National
Economic Commission studying ways to reduce the budget deficit
``won't get to first base'' in a Dukakis administration if it
recommends cuts in Social Security benefits.
   ``I am committed to maintaining full benefits and cost-of-living
increases,'' Dukakis said. ``No matter what the commission
recommends, as president I will ensure that the nation honors its
commitments so that current and future beneficiaries can count on
the promise of Social Security.''
   Dukakis took time out from preparations for his nationally
televised debate with Bush on Sunday at Winston-Salem, N.C., to
promise guaranteed health care for children and pregnant women, and
to accuse the vice president of ignoring the needs of poor families.
   Dukakis aides said Cuomo also may return to Boston on Friday,
when a campaign source said Dukakis is scheduled to take part in a
mock debate. Washington attorney Bob Barnett is standing in for
Bush, a role he played in 1984 when Geraldine Ferraro was preparing
for her debate with Bush.
   Dukakis spent much of Wednesday studying for the debate and has
rented a meeting room in a Boston hotel for practice sessions. New
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley was in town to offer advice Wednesday and
is expected back Friday. Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton also is to
visit Dukakis in advance of the debate.
   Bradley also attended Dukakis' only public appearance, his visit
to Brigham & Women's Hospital to outline his ``Healthy Start''
program, which is modeled after a Massachusetts program that has
provided services to 16,000 mothers since 1985. Dukakis visited
with two of them before delivering his speech.
   ``Today, more than 12 million children in this country grow up
in families without a dime's worth of health insurance,'' Dukakis
said. ``Too many of these children don't get checkups. They aren't
treated when they are sick, and they've never seen a dentist.''
   Dukakis said the Healthy Start program would provide money to
states that adopt efforts similar to a Massachusetts program that
has been cited as a factor in the state's declining infant
mortality rate.
   It offers doctors' and hospital care to pregnant women who are
uninsured or underinsured and also provides basic coverage for
their babies. Aides said the federal program would cost $100
million in the first year but that the money would be saved within
12 months because the government would not have to pick up the tab
for more expensive treatment of preventable childhood illnesses.
   Dukakis contrasted his proposal with Bush's record, listing
programs affecting poor families that have been targeted for cuts
by the Reagan administration.
   ``He was there when his administration conducted an annual
assault on immunization programs,'' Dukakis said. ``He was there
when they cut maternal and child health programs.''

<HEAD>Canada Apologizes For Internment Of Japanese During WWII</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney formally apologized
today for the internment of 22,000 Japanese-Canadians following
Japan's 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II.
   Mulroney said the Canadian government would provide $288 million
in compensation to the 12,000 survivors.
   Most of that money _ $252 million _ will be given in $21,000
payments to each of the survivors. The remainder will go to the
Japanese-Canadian community for educational, social and cultural
activities and to finance a new Canadian Race Relations Foundation.
   ``No amount of money can right the wrong, undo the harm and heal
the wounds,'' Mulroney told parliament as representatives of the
Japanese-Canadian community watched, then stood and applauded from
the public gallery.
   ``But it is symbolic of our determination to address this issue,
not only in the moral sense, but also in a tangible way,'' Mulroney
said.
   The Canadian leader said the internment was not only unjustified
on moral and legal grounds, but ``it went against the grain of the
country itself.''
   ``Error is an ingredient of humanity,'' Mulroney said solemnly.
``So, too, is apology and forgiveness. We have all learned from
personal experience that, inadequte as apologies are, they are the
only way we can cleanse the past, so that we may as best we can in
good conscience face the future.
   Japanese-Canadians were interned following the 1941 attack on
Pearl Harbor. Property was seized and 22,000, including 17,000
citizens, were relocated or interned on the Canadian Prairies or in
Northern Ontario camps.
   The U.S. government decided this summer to pay $20,000 to each
of the 120,000 survivors of U.S. internment camps.

   Ringo the police dog used his nose to sniff out
a robbery suspect in a lineup, but a judge rejected the
identification paws down, a court spokesman said Thursday.
   The German shepherd picked a suspect from a police lineup after
smelling a coat discovered in a jeep used as the getaway car from a
jewelry store robbery in Lod, a suburb of Tel Aviv.
   Gems worth about $50,000 were stolen in the robbery, the
national Itim news agency said.
   On Tuesday, Tel Aviv District Court Judge Arye Evenari threw
Ringo's identification out of court, ruling a dog's ``testimony''
could be used only to back up other evidence and could not stand
alone, the court spokesman said.
   Evenari also said a dog's identification had to be accompanied
by proof of the animal's qualifications, including its previous
experience in accurately identifying suspects, Itim said.

<HEAD>All 400 Reindeer Discarded In Annual Slaughter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lapp reindeer herdsmen in villages hit
by fallout from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident have thrown out
all the animals killed this week because radiation levels were many
times higher than allowed, a Swedish daily said Thursday.
   The Ostersunds Post said 400 reindeer were discarded in the
northern province of Jamtland after the annual slaughter when tests
on the meat disclosed cesium levels ranging up to 4,500 Becquerels
per pound.
   A Becquerel is a unit to describe the activity of radioactive
substance. The approved government limit for the meat for
consumption is about 680 Becquerels per pound.
   ``I'm beginning to lose faith that there is a future in raising
reindeer,'' said Thomas Ahstrand, 22, a herder reached by telephone
in his village of Frostviken.
   About 10 percent of Sweden's total reindeer slaughter was banned
for eating, the Ostersunds Post said.
   ``We raise reindeer for the garbage dumps. There is no sign that
the cesium levels are being reduced by even a few Becquerels,''
said Ahstrand, who bought his first herd of 50 animals just before
the Chernobyl nuclear plant in the Soviet Ukraine sent up a cloud
of radioactivity in April 1986.
   Thirty-one people died in the world's worst nuclear plant
disaster.
   Sweden was badly affected by fallout because of a freak wind
that carried the radioactive isotope cesium 137 over a belt of the
northern and central regions. Sweden's 300,000 reindeer were
particularly vulnerable because they feed on lichen, which soaks up
cesium and is slow to dispose of the contamination.
   The Swedish government compensates the herders at market prices
for the destroyed meat, but the semi-nomadic Lapps, or Samis as
they prefer to call themselves, say their lifestyle has been
threatened.
   ``We ask ourselves how long will the government keep on
supporting us,'' said Ahstrand.
   Last year Ahstrand and other herdsmen rescued part of their
reindeer by moving them 250 miles south to graze in an
uncontaminated region. But the move was costly and difficult, and
the herdsmen stayed home this year.
   ``We felt that we didn't belong there. We have lived in the
mountains for so many centuries tending our herds among these
fields, it is more than an occupation. It's a way of life,'' said
Ahstrand.

   A roadside shoemaker jumped into a pile of
blazing goods and burned to death after sanitation men seized his
wares and set them afire, witnesses said Thursday.
   The witnesses said the shoemaker, whose name was not available,
had collected enough capital as a beggar to set himself up with a
roadside shop.
   A team of sanitation workers, enforcing a ban on street trading,
raided the Yaba commercial district where the shoemaker worked. The
traders fled, watching from a distance as the officials began
burning their wares.
   Witnesses, including a Nigerian radio correspondent, said the
shoemaker ran and jumped into the fire before anyone could stop
him. Hundreds of shoppers and traders watched as he died.
   The street trading ban was imposed to reduce congestion on the
streets of this city of more than 4 million people.

   Dozens of uniformed police manhandled a
group of Georgian nationalists Thursday when they tried to protest
near the site of a U.S.-Soviet citizens conference.
   Georgian activists said at least 15 demonstrators were detained
after police hauled them away from the Georgian Academy of Sciences
building on Rustaveli Street, the main thoroughfare of the capital
of the southern republic.
   Around the corner from the columned academy entrance, at the
Georgian Filmmakers Union building, representatives of both
superpowers were discussing environmental problems.
   Former New York Times Moscow correspondent Hedrick Smith and
former deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow,
Richard Combs, were among those who looked on as police dragged off
women demonstrators by the hair and pushed others into cars.
   Tbilisi, in the Caucasus Mountains about 1,000 miles south of
Moscow, is hosting a six-day program ending Saturday for nearly 300
U.S. officials, cultural figures, businessmen and citizens and
their Soviet counterparts.
   The fourth annual exchange is co-sponsored by the
state-sanctioned Soviet Friendship Society and the Chautauqua
Institution of upstate New York.
   Some Georgians used the conference's two-day debate on human
rights at the filmmakers building to urge their own government to
safeguard a historic monastery and the Georgian language.
   The demonstrators at the Georgian academy exceeded 100 and made
the same demands, including a call to scrap the Soviet army
artillery range they say is damaging a nearby cultural treasure,
the monastery of David Garija.
   Preserving the monastery, 50 miles outside Tbilisi, has become a
crusade for many Georgians who regard it as a symbol of the people
and their Christian religion.
   The unrest was part of widespread protests in the area. Troops
patrolled the streets of Yerevan, Armenia's capital, and
Stepanakert, the main city of the disputed Azerbaijan territory of
Nagorno-Karabakh. One man has died and 48 have been injured in
clashes between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, officials say.
   Before noon Thursday, uniformed police rushed the square in
front of the House of Film, forcing protesters to group instead on
the steps of the Academy of Science building.
   Zviad Gomsakhurdjia, one of the protest's organizers, accused
police of detaining well-known Georgian nationalists and human
rights activists at home so they could not take part.
   Most of the protesters sat in the afternoon sun at the academy's
entrance. Fights and scuffles broke out between protesters and
plainclothes officers who circulated in the crowd.
   One American witness said she saw a policeman take a shovel from
a nearby construction site and hurl it into the mass of protesters.
   Gomsakhurdjia said policemen trying to arrest him and others
ripped his coat to shreds.
   The protesters then moved to other sites in this city of more
than 1 million people, and their ranks grew.
   About 275 staged a sit-in on the steps of Tbilisi State
University, and as dusk fell, an estimated 750 were gathered
outside the offices of Georgia's Supreme Soviet, the nominal
parliament.
   Fourteen people who said they were arrested at the academy
showed up later at the university and told the crowd they were
released. They accused authorities of beating them.
   The crowd outside the university's main building sang the
Georgian national anthem and 19th century songs about their
homeland.
   No violence was reported at the Georgian Supreme Soviet or at
the university. At the university, 70 to 80 uniformed policemen
stood guard along with 25 officers from the regular armed forces,
or Interior Ministry troops.

   About 1,700 students chanted slogans
at an anti-Olympic rally Thursday and burned figures representing
the United States and Japan, which they charge are bolstering
authoritarian rule in South Korea.
   The students from 12 schools in Seoul demonstrated at Yonsei
University to demand that the Olympics in Seoul be shared with
communist North Korea. They also called for an end to the U.S.
military presence in South Korea.
   ``Oppose dictatorial Olympics,'' the students shouted.
   After the rally, the protesters marched to the school's main
gate, where they faced about 2,000 riot police blocking the way.
The students did not try to march out and there was no
confrontation.
   The protesters, chanting slogans and singing, marched around the
campus as speakers called for a struggle to drive out the 42,000
U.S. troops stationed in South Korea under a defense treaty.
   Protesters burned effigies of figures with U.S. and Japanese
flags painted on them. ``Yankee go home,'' students yelled.
   Huge placards hanging down the sides of school buildings read
``Oppose the Olympics, which perpetuate the national division'' and
``No war and no nuclear bombs.''
   Radical students condend that the ``half Olympics,'' boycotted
by North Korea, raises the risk of war on the Korean peninsula.
   Most of the demonstrations have been small and peaceful with
just a handful of students taking part. The great majority of South
Koreans want the Games to be a success and oppose the
demonstrations.
   Protesters denounced the United States and Japan for helping to
guard the Olympics from possible threats from North Korea. U.S.
forces in South Korea are on increased alert and U.S. and Japanese
naval forces are helping patrol the surrounding seas.
   North Korea is boycotting the Games because its demand to
co-host the Games was rejected. The International Olympic Committee
said the Olympics could not be shared because they are awarded to a
singl city.

<TEXT>
   The United States and the Soviet Union today
launched a comprehensive review of their relations as President
Reagan hinted the two sides may be drawing nearer at resolving some
of their differences.
   Asked if Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, who began
the discussions with Secretary of State George P. Shultz, had
``brought good news,'' the president replied, ``I think so.''
   Reagan, who spoke briefly with reporters as he left the White
House for a trip to Texas, did not elaborate.
   Later, however, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said
the Soviets had provided ``some ideas'' to U.S. officials of their
proposals in advance. He declined to give details.
   The talks may be the last full-scale review of relations between
the two superpowers before Reagan leaves office next January.
   Going into the meetings with Shultz at the State Department,
Shevardnadze told reporters he planned ``full-scope negotiations''
and had with him ``specific proposals in many areas.''
   Speaking through an interpreter, Shevardnadze said, ``We have
not come empty handed. As you can see we have a lot of baggage.''
   He said the discussions would cover nuclear and space weapons
along with conventional armaments and chemical weapons.
   Shevardnadze said the two sides will take up continuing
differences over interpretations of the 1972 Anti-Ballistics
Missile Treaty and will seek to narrow the gap on their joint
effort to achieve reductions in strategic nuclear weapons.
   Also on the table will be proposals for reducing air-launched
and sea-launched cruise missiles.
   Shevardnadze arrived at the State Department two hours later
than originally planned. U.S. officials said Shevardnadze had asked
for the delay, complaining that he was tired after his
trans-Atlantic flight on Wednesday.
   Shevardnadze's talks here will include separate meetings Friday
with Reagan and Vice President George Bush. The latter encounter is
being held at Bush's request, a U.S. official said, adding that
Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis has not asked for a
meeting with the Soviet diplomat.
   But Shevardnadze, during his remarks on arrival, appeared to
leave open the possibility of a meeting with Dukakis.
   With no new summit meeting on the horizon and no prospect for a
major arms reduction agreement, Shevardnadze's visit lacks some of
the drama which has accompanied many of his previous 27 meetings
with Shultz dating back to 1985.
   According to well established procedures, the agenda for the
talks includes discussions on nuclear issues, human rights,
bilateral issues and Third World military conflicts in which both
countries have an interest.
   Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne Ridgway told reporters
there is no possibility that the two sides will be able to resolve
differences before the end of the year on their mutual goal of
achieving 50 percent cuts in strategic ballistic missile warheads.
Many of the unresolved issues involve ways to verify that each side
is fulfilling its commitment.
   One area in which some progress may be possible centers on the
Peaceful Nuclear Explosion Treaty, which was approved during the
mid 1970's but never ratified.
   Ridgway said the two sides are ``very close'' to a an agreement
governing verification of the treaty, which sets ground rules for
use of nuclear weapons for such activities as building dams and
altering the course of rivers.
   Once verification procedures are agreed to, the treaty will be
submitted to the Senate for ratification.
   Shultz and Shevardnadze also planned to discuss verification
procedures for a second unratified treaty which limits to 150
kilotons the size of underground nuclear explosions each side may
carry out. As part of an experiment to improve verification
procedures, experts from the two sides have been monitoring each
other's nuclear tests.
   Perhaps the most serious area of arms control contention between
Washington and Moscow involves a U.S. demand for the dismantling of
a Soviet radar facility at Krasnoyarsk.
   The administration has said repeatedly that the installation
violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty because it could be
used to coordinate defense of Soviet missile silos or other
military facilities.
   On regional issues, the two sides are encouraged by the
prospects for agreement on the withdrawal of all foreign forces
from Angola and Namibia, a high priority administration goal.
   But Moscow's decision to continue arms shipments to Nicaragua's
leftist government even after the U.S. military aid cutoff to the
Contra rebels has been a major disappointment for the
administration.
   Administration officials have said that the Soviets have refused
to negotiate seriously on this issue.

   Comedian Jackie Mason went for broke Thursday
with some of New York City's power brokers in a breakfast-time
Monopoly game to benefit a homeless program.
   ``I just collected rent from people who've been robbing me all
my life,'' Mason joked as he took the play money from the likes of
developers Lewis Rudin and Leonard Stern, also chairman of The
Hartz Group Inc.
   The game was held at the Regency Hotel, birthplace of the
``power breakfast,'' to raise money for ``Homes for the Homeless,''
a non-profit organization providing families with temporary shelter.
   Loews Hotels President Jonathan M. Tisch said more than $10,000
was raised.
   Parker Brothers customized its game of wheeling and dealing for
the benefit, and said it was the first time real-life real estate
moguls faced each other across the board. The other players were
former Postmaster General Preston Robert Tisch, now president of
Loews Corp. financial company, and New York Times architecture
critic Paul Goldberger. The banker was the 1987 U.S. Monopoly
champion, Gary Peters.
   The 200 or so people who attended the $50-a-plate breakfast also
pledged real donations to the homeless program against the players'
phony earnings.

   Far-out news on the creator of ``The Far
Side'' comic strip: ``They've stolen Gary Larson,'' says the
curator of astronomy at the Dayton Museum of Natural History, ``a
life-sized, enormous photo of Gary Larson.''
   Art Goss says the photo of the cartoonist, which belongs with an
exhibit at the museum of Larson's work, was taken this week.
   The photo ``was standing there in the glassed-in entryway of the
museum, and some college-age guys stole it,'' Goss says.
   The exhibit includes more than 400 framed enlargements of ``Far
Side'' cartoons.
   Despite the theft, Larson's image remains. Two other life-sized
photos show Larson sitting on the floor and leaning against an
exhibit.

   Country singer Johnny Paycheck, facing a
prison sentence for a barroom shooting, is donating his royalties
from a new gospel music album to fight AIDS in children, a
spokesman said Thursday.
   Billy D. Burns, executive producer of the album ``Outlaw at the
Cross,'' said Paycheck will give the money to a Los Angeles-based
agency that helps children with AIDS.
   The album, on Damascus to the Cross Records, will be available
next week. Paycheck's royalties amount to $1.10 per record sold,
Burns said.
   Paycheck faces up to 9{ years in prison in Ohio for his 1986
conviction for wounding a man at a tavern. He is free on bond while
the case is under appeal. He is best known for his 1978 hit ``Take
This Job and Shove It.''

   Michael Crawford, who is leaving the hit
Broadway musical ``The Phantom of the Opera'' next month, says he
needs a rest after two years with the show.
   ``It's like being an athlete,'' he said on CBS's ``This
Morning'' in a program for broadcast Friday. ``You have to have a
rest period and then start up again. I mean I'm not finished with
the Phantom. I want to come back and do it again.''
   Crawford, who won a Tony Award for his portrayal of the Phantom,
says the lavish musical has been an emotional experience.
   ``I cry every night. I cry every single night in the show. It
makes me weep at the end. ... Because I'm no longer performing for
the audience and so I just turn around and, for myself, I cry for
him, because he's a wonderful character,'' he said.
   His last show is Oct. 8. Opera singer Timothy Nolen replaces
Crawford.

   New York Mets left-hander Bob Ojeda won't be on
the mound at least until spring training after severing part of the
middle finger of his pitching hand with an electric hedge clipper,
doctors say.
   The Mets said Ojeda underwent five hours of successful
microsurgery Wednesday at Roosevelt Hospital. Doctors said the tip
of the finger was reattached, but recovery is expected to take four
to six months.
   The accident Wednesday at Ojeda's Long Island home nearly
severed the finger at the joint after the clippers slipped.
   ``It is a blow,'' Mets general manager Frank Cashen said. Hours
after the accident, the team clinched at least a tie in the
National League's East Division.
   Ojeda, 30, who missed most of last season after elbow surgery,
was 10-13 for the Mets this season with a 2.88 earned run average.

for songwriters' legal rights.
   ``I guess it's pretty obvious how grateful we are to writers,''
Ms. Murray said Wednesday as she announced the Nov. 16 concert for
the Nashville Songwriters Association International. ``Without
them, I wouldn't be here.''
   Association President Bob DiPiero said the showcase will be an

songwriters to the entertainment industry.
   Ms. Murray noted the long list of hits she has had from the pens
of Nashville songwriters. Those numbers include ``A Little Good

<HEAD>Debate Coaches Unimpressed by Dukakis, Bush Debating Abilities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Debate experts say that neither George Bush
nor Michael Dukakis is any great shakes as a public speaker, and
the winner of their first face-to-face showdown Sunday night may be
whoever exceeds low expectations.
   Veteran forensic judges also agree that the candidates will try
their utmost to observe the cardinal rule of presidential debates:
avoid calamitous mistakes.
   That may be good politics, but it can make for dull debating,
said members of the Associated Press presidential debate judges
panel.
   James J. Unger, executive director of the National Forensics
Institute at American University in Washington, D.C., and chairman
of the judges' panel, said these high-stakes debates ``are
exercises in error-avoidance by the candidates.''
   Unger, who also chaired AP panels that judged the presidential
debates in 1976, 1980 and 1984, said it is rare for a candidate to
make a major gaffe like Gerald Ford's in 1976 when he insisted that
Eastern Europe was not dominated by the Soviet Union.
   All too often, he added, ``the candidates just sit there with
their prepared answers desperately seeking out a question to which
they can attach the answer.''
   William Southworth, director of forensics and speech professor
at the University of Redlands in California, said, ``I'm not
convinced either one of them is going to be dynamic confronting
each other. ... A lot will depend on how willing they are to take
risks.''
   Frank Sferra, debate coach at J.K. Mullen High School in Denver
and president of the National Forensic League, said, ``Neither one
is a terribly exciting speaker.''
   ``I get the feeling they're too programmed to be debaters. You
bring up an issue and they know where they're supposed to run and
what to say,'' said Sferra. ``They're all so afraid they're going
to say something wrong.''
   Dukakis engaged in 21 debates during the primaries with his
rivals for the Democratic nomination, and he once moderated a
public television debate series called ``The Advocates.''
   Bush faced off with his Republican rivals seven times. He also
has a 1984 vice presidential debate with Democrat Geraldine Ferraro
under his belt _ the one about which he boasted afterwards that he
``tried to kick a little ass.''
   Melissa Maxey Wade, director of forensics at Emory University in
Atlanta, said that in the primary debates, ``Bush demonstrated more
range, positive and negative. He had very strong, persuasive
responses when he was being attacked by (Al) Haig and (Jack) Kemp
in the early debates.''
   Dukakis was ``real consistent. He doesn't seem to make major
goofs. He doesn't have big highs or big lows,'' she said.
   Lanny D. Naegelin, a speech-theater arts specialist for the
North East Independent School District in San Antonio, Texas, said
both Bush and Dukakis lack ``pizzazz'' as speakers, but ``Dukakis
is easier when he talks than Bush. It's more obvious when Bush
speaks that he's working at what he's doing.''
   James M. Copeland, national executive secretary of the National
Forensic League, Ripon, Wis., said Dukakis ``has great debate
skills, but he tends to be very monotone and flat in his
presentation.'' He said Bush ``is a very strained speaker. His
voice tends to get a little screechy when he's excited.''
   Sherry Hall, debate coach at Harvard University in Cambridge,
Mass., said that in collegiate debates, content wins more points
than style. But in these presidential debates, ``the emphasis is
much more on style,'' she said.
   ``That's what people remember. With (President) Reagan four
years ago, people remember how he looked, not what he said,'' she
said.
   The seven-member panel will use a scorecard similar to that
employed in collegiate and scholastic debates to determine a winner
of the Sept. 25 Bush-Dukakis debate. It will also evaluate their
second debate on Oct. 13 or 14, and their running mates' Oct. 5
encounter.

<HEAD>Iran Says It Is Clearing Mines From Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Iranian navy began mine-clearing
operations in the Persian Gulf on Thursday, Iran's official news
agency reported as Iran marked the eighth anniversary of Iraq's
invasion.
   The Islamic Republic news Agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted
the unidentified commander of Iran's naval mine sweepers as saying
that helicopters and frogmen also were involved in the
mine-clearing.
   The Iranian navy can defuse magnetic, contact and other types of
mines, the officer was quoted as saying.
   He said the operations underlined ``the Islamic Republic's
commitment to maintaining security and guaranteeing the safety of
shipping in the region.''
   The report could not be confirmed independently.
   A United Nations-sponsored cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war began
Aug. 20.
   When Iran's naval commander, Rear Adm. Mohammad-Hussein
Malekzadegan, announced last week that his forces would begin
mine-clearing operations, a U.S. official said that was
``tantamount to admitting that they laid the mines'' during the
8-year-old war.
   Iran has never admitted it laid mines in the waterway's shipping
lane, but said it did so in its coastal waters for defense. But
Tehran boasted last year that it could sow mines ``like seeds'' in
the gulf.
   The U.S. Navy captured the Iran Ajr, an Iranian naval vessel, in
the gulf a year ago while it was allegedly laying mines at night.
Several mines were found aboard the ship and others it had laid
were found nearby.
   IRNA gave no other details on the mine-clearing or specify where
it was being carried out. The naval officer said only that the
operation was being conducted in ``international waters'' in the
600-mile-long gulf.
   The U.S. and other Western navies that sent forces to the gulf
to protect neutral shipping have found dozens of mines, mainly in
the northern and central sectors of the waterway, since July 1987.
   IRNA said Iranian ships detected and destroyed four mines last
year in the Gulf of Oman off the United Arab Emirates port of Khor
Fakkan. Western naval officials believe the Iranians had planted
the mines in the first place.
   At least eight ships, including the reflagged Kuwaiti tanker
Bridgeton and the U.S. missile frigate Samuel B. Roberts, have been
sunk or damaged by mines in the last 16 months. Western officials
said all were apparently laid by the Iranians.
   U.S. Navy officers estimate that as many as 200 mines, mainly
contact-type devices moored to the seabed, are still in the gulf.
Most are believed to be in shallow waters of the Iraqi coast in the
northern end of the gulf.
   Iraq is believed to have laid some, but most are believed to be
Iranian.
   Iran's navy had four coastal and two inshore mine sweepers when
the war broke out in September 1980, along with a squadron of six
U.S.-built RH-53D mine helicopters.
   Western analysts believe that only two of the Iranian mine
sweepers remain operational, while the two surviving RH-53D
helicopters are no longer able to function as mine sweepers.
   In Tehran, ``Sacred Defense Week,'' organized to mark the eighth
anniversary of the war, opened with a military parade in Azadi
Square, IRNA reported.
   The Iranians and most military historians say the war began when
the Iraqi army stormed across the border Sept. 22, 1980. Iraq says
the conflict began Sept. 4, when the Iranians shelled border towns
after weeks of skirmishing.
   Iran's President, Ali Khamenei, reviewed the parade and
declared, ``Although we have no practical war at the fronts ... yet
we do not feel the enemy's threat any less than before,'' IRNA said.
   He called on Iran's forces to remain on alert because ``the
enemy intends to again plot against this nation and the Islamic
Revolution.''
   He charged that the Iraqis were massing troops along the border
and warned Baghdad against ``renewed aggression.''
   IRNA, in a separate commentary, termed Sept. 22, 1980, ``the
blackest day in contemporary history ... the day the army of
pagandom launched a war against Islam ... the day the hordes of
ignorance charged against the citadel of wisdom.''

<HEAD>Reagan Undergoes Medical Exam Before Meeting Astronauts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WACO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan was pronounced disease-free
today after undergoing a second medical examination before meeting
the Discovery space shuttle astronauts at the Johnson Space Center
in Houston.
   ``I'm fine,'' Reagan called out to reporters as he left Air
Force One en route to a speaking engagement at Baylor University
before visiting the astronauts.
   As if to dramatize the opinion of the White House physician, Dr.
Lawrence C. Mohr, that he is free of disease, the president danced
a little jig before entering his armored limousine.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters during the flight to
Waco that Reagan was examined first on Tuesday as a precaution for
his meeting with the astronauts, who are under a modified
quarantine before their scheduled Sept. 29 launch.
   ``The main thing is to check for a cold or a virus that can be
easily transmitted,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said Reagan's senior aides and Secret Service detail were
required to complete medical data forms before they were cleared to
enter the space center with the president. Only Reagan will have
direct contact with the five astronauts.
   ``We're all clean,'' Fitzwater quipped about the presidential
staff.

<HEAD>Gandhi Withdraws Defamation Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NILOVA ROY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, Indian (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on Thursday
withdrew a defamation bill that journalists and opposition
politicians charged was an attempt at censorship.
   ``We praise all good deeds by the government,'' said Prithvis
Chakravarthy, an editor of the Calcutta-based, Bengali-language
newspaper Aajkal and member of the Editor's Guild of India. ``This
withdrawal is one of the few good acts committed by the government
in a long time, and we welcome it.''
   In a statement, Gandhi said he was withdrawing the bill because
``it has aroused misapprehensions and misgivigs'' among the press
and public.
   The law would have expanded the concept of defamation and
abolished any presumption of innocence by journalists or others
making disclosures construed as defamatory.
   It permitted up to two years' imprisonment for first offenders
and up to five years' imprisonment for subsequent convictions.
   The government had said the legislation would protect people
from irresponsible journalism. Newspapers denounced it as
``fascist'' and ``undemocratic'' and said it was an attempt to
muzzle the press after a year of reports of alleged kickbacks
involving defense contracts.
   Prominent Indians, including some of Gandhi's friends, have been
accused of receiving millions of dollars to facilitate contracts
for Sweden's Bofors artillery guns and West German submarines.
Gandhi has denied receiving any money, and a government inquiry
failed to note any wrongdoing.
   Gandhi said the issue of defamation still must be resolved.
   ``The freedom and rights of the individual are ... sacred. It is
this that makes the issue of defamation serious,'' his statement
said.
   The defamation bill was passed by the lower house of Parliament
on Aug. 30, but it still required a vote by the upper house.

<TEXT>
   A combination of Southern antiques and
artifacts from India should provide a one-of-kind tourist
attraction at an antebellum mansion, say its owners, a group of
Hare Krishnas who have opened it to the public.
   The Old South Society for Vedic Life, which has about 20
members, recently acquired Gloucester House in this historic,
Mississippi River city and hopes to make it a popular spot for
visitors.
   ``We're still in the process of decorating and furnishing. But
we went ahead and opened the house because it's so unique in
itself. We could show it even if it were completely empty. It's in
all the major picture books and is an example of one of the finest
suburban villas in Natchez,'' Nico Kuyt, leader of the Church
Hill-based group, said this week.
   Kuyt said that while the list price for the home was $1.25
million, the society paid only ``a fraction'' of that cost.
   ``It was a very reasonable price,'' he said. ``We financed the
purchase, so now it's, `We owe, we owe, it's off to work we go.'''
   Kuyt said tours of the pre-Civil War mansion will cost $4 per
person.
   ``We have moved our cultural tour program about Vedic life down
to Gloucester. That's on the second floor,'' he said. ``The first
floor is a period house, with an 1820s dining room ... and an 1830s
library.''
   The parlor of the home is of the 1850-60 period.
   The society distributed brochures this week to welcome centers
all over Mississippi to let people know the house is open for tours.
   ``Gloucester was on the Pilgrimage Garden Club tour until about
two years ago, when the last owner decided to take it off,'' Kuyt
said. ``We're serious about tourism. We have plans for developing
the house very nicely.
   ``We plan on offering a very special, very unique tour _ not a
15-minute rush through,'' he said.

<NOTE>Eds: Updates in top 10 grafs with Dukakis, Bush in Boston, picking

<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis and George Bush, counting down to their
nationally televised debate on Sunday, swiped at each other three
days early today from different parts of Boston.
   As Bush arrived in town to try and embarrass Dukakis by
accepting the endorsement of a Boston police union, Dukakis, the
Massachusetts governor, was telling senior citizens at a separate
gathering that the Democrats would ``stop the attack on Social
Security and Medicare.''
   Dukakis told the elderly people that Bush had once referred to
Social Security as ``largely a welfare program'' and had cast the
tie-breaking vote in the Senate in 1985 on a bill ``to deny you a
cost-of-living increase in your Social Security and to make you pay
more for your medical benefits.''
   Bush, meanwhile, was greeted by several hundred pro-Dukakis
demonstrators when his motorcade pulled up at a Boston restaurant
where he was to receive the police endorsement.
   The protesters carried signs and chanted, ``Bush go home.''
   Inside, Bush supporters chanted in return, ``We want Bush'' and
``Dump the Duke,'' and one Dukakis backer who shouted out during
the proceedings was ejected by police officers.
   ``My opponent is strongly out of the American mainstream on
issues such as fighting crime,'' said the Republican vice
president, who was flanked by about three-dozen members of the
Boston Police Patrolman's Association.
   ``Your endorsement is more than an endorsement of me; it's an
endorsement of a philosophy. This is an enormous boost for me,''
Bush said.
   The candidates were easing back their public schedules after
today in order to prepare for the debate. The faceoff was just
three days away, but Bush's top aide said today the two sides still
hadn't settled on who would ask the questions.
   ``The Dukakis campaign made a proposal that we use only network
anchors for the panelists and the moderator _ three panelists and
one moderator _ and we said we didn't think that would be
appropriate because that would entirely foreclose print media
participation,'' said campaign chairman James Baker III.
   He said the Bush campaign had submitted a list of 14 names
including print journalists and network correspondents as well as
TV anchors.
   President Reagan, in comments prepared for delivery at Baylor
University in Texas, criticized Democrats _ implying Dukakis though
not naming him _ as ``born-again George Pattons'' in supporting
strong military defense.
   While Vice President Bush spent Wednesday engaging in a mock
debate and in briefings with advisers, Dukakis conferred with Sen.
Bill Bradley of New Jersey on the Sunday night faceoff.
   The Democratic nominee, according to campaign sources, scheduled
his own mock debate on Friday and planned to meet with two
governors well-versed in the successes and pitfalls of public
speaking _ Mario Cuomo of New York and Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
   Dukakis played down the endorsement by the Boston Police
Patrolman's Association, citing the association's ``history of
supporting Republicans'' and the backing he has received from other
law enforcement organizations, including the Massachusetts Police
Association, the International Brotherhood of Police Officers and
the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas _ Bush's home
state.
   Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported that Bush's campaign
plans to spend more than 60 percent of its $54 million budget on
television advertising.
   Dukakis spokesman Mark Gearan said, ``I think we'll be
competitive with the Bush campaign, but beyond that we don't detail
our spending.''
   Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen was pitching
the Democratic ticket's theme of ``good jobs at good wages'' in
Santa Clara, Calif., and Everett, Wash. Republican vice
presidential candidate Dan Quayle was addressing the Council of
Foreign Affairs in Los Angeles.
   On Wednesday, Dukakis proposed his ``Healthy Start'' program,
which would provide prenatal and post-partum care to pregnant women
and children who are either uninsured or underinsured.
   Dukakis met with two new mothers and their babies at Brigham &
Women's Hospital in Boston and said afterward, ``When the time came
to stand up for our children's health care needs, George Bush was
nowhere to be found.''
   The Democratic nominee spent the rest of the day preparing for
the debate, even renting a meeting room in a Boston hotel for
practice sessions, said campaign sources who requested anonymity.
   The sources said Dukakis will hold a mock debate on Friday with
Washington attorney Bob Barnett standing in for Bush. Barnett
played the same role in 1984 when Democratic vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro was preparing for her debate with Bush.
   Negotiators for the two campaigns neared agreement on the
heights of the lecterns for the debate at Wake Forest University in
Winston-Salem, N.C.
   The 6-foot-1 inch Bush will stand at a 48-inch high lectern,
according to a Bush source who said the 5-foot-8 Dukakis will use a
41-inch lectern and a riser.
   A new poll, meanwhile, found that Bush has gained in the race
for the White House by solidifying his support among Republicans
and Republican-leaning independents.
   The survey, conducted by Gallup for the Times Mirror Corp.,
showed that Bush has benefited from increased satisfaction with the
course of the nation and confidence in the economy.
   The news was not all good for the Republican ticket, which
received a bit of critical advice Wednesday from an unlikely source
_ retired Sen. Barry Goldwater.
   ``I want you to go back and tell George Bush to start talking
about the issues, OK?'' the conservative and 1964 GOP presidential
nominee told Quayle after introducing him to a Rotary Club luncheon
in Phoenix.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain accused three Czechoslovak diplomats
Thursday of spying and ordered them to leave the country within two
weeks.
   A Foreign Office announcement said the three envoys, including
two military attaches, ``engaged in activities incompatible with
their status'' _ diplomatic parlance for espionage.
   The diplomats are Maj. Bedrich Kramar, the assistant military
and air attache; Maj. Vlastmil Netolicky, a member of the military
attache's staff, and Paval Moudry, a member of the commercial
section.
   The expulsions prompted speculation the envoys were linked with
a London-based art dealer, Erwin van Haarlem, who says he is
Czechoslovakian and who is awaiting trial on charges of preparing
to set up a spy ring.
   Britain also has complained this year about supplies of
Czechoslovak-made explosives reaching the outlawed Irish Republican
Army, which is waging a bombing and shooting campaign to drive the
British from Northern Ireland.
   The Foreign Office refused to elaborate on its terse
announcement. At the Czechoslovak Embassy, a telephone receptionist
told reporters after the 12:45 p.m. announcement that the embassy
was closed for lunch and said later it was closed for the day.
   In Prague, Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry spokesman Dusan
Rovensky said he had no comment.
   Czechoslovak Ambassador Jan Fidler was summoned to the Foreign
Office on Thursday morning and given the expulsion order.
   ``The Foreign Secretary (Sir Geoffrey Howe) wishes it to be
clearly understood that, while we wish to build up our relations
with Czechoslovakia, we are not prepared to relax our policy on the
sort of activities in which Maj. Kramar, Maj. Netolicky and Mr.
Moudry have engaged,'' the statement said.
   Kramar and Moudry have been in Britain since 1984, and Netolicky
arrived in September 1985, the Foreign Office said.
   They brought to seven the number of Czechoslovak diplomats
Britain has expelled since 1983, usually amid speculation the
envoys were suspected of spying on behalf of the Soviet Union.
   ``There are certain instances, for example, where the KGB (the
Soviet secret police) or the GRU (Soviet military intelligence) has
not wanted to get directly involved and has used Czech intelligence
to do so,'' Christopher Lee, a defense analyst at Emmanuel College,
Cambridge, said in a radio interview Thursday.
   Van Haarlem, who has a Dutch passport, was arrested last April
at his London apartment. Police burst in and said they caught him
using radio equipment to transmit signals ``to a foreign power.''
   He has been indicted for trial at London's Old Bailey Central
Criminal Court. No date has been set.
   Britain last expelled Soviet diplomats in September 1985. A
total of 31 Soviets and 31 Britons, including businessmen and
journalists, were ordered out of London and Moscow in a series of
retaliatory expulsions.
   Britain has expelled four other diplomats in the past month: a
Tunisian who refused to pay hundreds of dollars of parking fines, a
Vietnamese who brandished a gun at demonstrators, a Cuban who fired
a gun in a street, and the Cuban ambassador.

   The University of Alabama's president
Thursday upheld a two-year suspension of the school's chapter of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, the nation's largest fraternity, because of
repeated disciplinary problems.
   The chapter was charged in June with violating the university's
code against drug use and trafficking, and campus officials ordered
it closed for two years.
   Alabama's acting president, E. Roger Sayers, reviewing an appeal
of the suspension, announced he would uphold it because of a series
of problems, including a 1979 hazing incident, 1982 public
drunkenness, theft and obscene conduct cases and recent drug
incidents, including the alleged sale of cocaine at the house last
spring.
   Bill Smithart, a Tuscaloosa attorney who heads an alumni board
set up to direct the chapter about 1{ years ago, argued that the
fraternity is being unfairly penalized and that members are being
blamed for incidents that happened before they arrived at
Tuscaloosa.

   A tearful woman, clutching a stuffed
animal, broke down on the witness stand today after testifying that
she was raped and sodomized by a group of men.
   ``I was screaming and telling him to stop. ... He was holding my
legs. I was trying to push him off,'' the 19-year-old woman said of
defendant Orlando Garza, 23, the first to be tried of the 10 men
indicted in the case.
   She said Garza was laughing as he raped her on the hood of a
car, and that other men nearby joined in and also sexually
assaulted her. After she had testified for about one hour, the
court recessed when the woman, in tears, said she was about to
faint.
   On Wednesday, the doctor who examined the woman said she was
scratched and bruised, including internal bruises, when she arrived
at a hospital for treatment.
   ``She told me she had been sexually assaulted by as many as 20
to 23 men,'' said Dr. Vilma Garcia, who examined her at Humana
Hospital-Corpus Christi on March 27.
   The woman said ``that they were her neighbors,'' Garcia
testified Wednesday in the sexual assault trial.
   Assistant District Attorney Rodolfo Gutierrez said he expected
the woman to continue her testimony later today.
   The woman, who was a resident of San Diego at the time, told
authorities she was kidnapped and sexually assaulted by the men
over a period of several hours on the night of March 26-27.
   All 10 have pleaded innocent to charges including kidnapping,
aggravated kidnapping and sexual assault.
   ``This was not a kidnapping,'' defense attorney Albert Pena said
in an interview Wednesday. ``She voluntarily went.''
   Jose Carlos Briones testified Wednesday that the woman scratched
her attackers, cried out for help and fainted while she was being
raped on the hood of a car outside town.
   Briones, 29, said the woman cried: ``Help me, please help me.''
   ``She was moaning and groaning. She had tears in her eyes,''
Briones said in Spanish through an interpreter.
   ``I was the only one who told them to leave her alone,'' said
Briones, who also faces a sexual assault charge in the case.
   Prosecutors have promised to recommend probation for Briones in
exchange for his testimony. Briones says he was impotent at the
time of the attack from drinking too much beer.
   When Pena asked him if the woman was making sounds of pleasure,
Briones answered: ``It was nothing about being happy.''
   He said Garza held the woman's wrists during part of the attack.
   ``He (Garza) told me to hold her because she was scratching
him,'' Briones said.
   Briones said he saw several of the other defendants assaulting
the woman.
   Sexual assault is punishable by two to 20 years in prison and-or
a fine of up to $10,000.
   The woman, her husband and two children have moved to an
undisclosed location in another city because of reported harassment
since she accused the 10 men.

<HEAD>American School Children Perform Poorly In Science Education,
Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Science literacy among America's school
children is at an ``alarming and depressing'' level that may
prevent many high school graduates from doing well in skilled jobs
or college-level course, according to a study released Thursday.
   ``The Science Report Card,'' a federally funded project
conducted by the Educational Testing Service of Princeton, N.J.,
found that more than half of the nation's 17-year-olds are so
poorly educated in science that they cannot benefit from special
job training and cannot perform work requiring basic technical
understanding.
   Only seven percent of the 17-year-olds in the study demonstrated
sufficient skills to do well in college-level science courses.
   Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, called the findings ``depressing and alarming,'' and said
the poor level of science education could be ``disastrous'' for the
country.
   The science report card reflects data collected in 1986. It is
the fifth national study of science skills among 9-, 13- and
17-year-olds to be conducted by the NEA since 1969.
   Among the findings:
   _Science achievement remains well below the results of the 1969
study for students at age 17, although there was a slight upturn
observed in the 1982 and 1986 surveys.
   _Declines in science achievement are less for pupils aged 9 and
13, but the average achievement at age 13 remains below that
measured in 1970, and achievement at age 9 has only now returned to
the level measured in 1970.
   _Science proficiency for black and hispanic students aged 13 and
17 remains at least four years behind the levels of white students
of the same ages.
   A marked difference in science proficiency is measured between
girls and boys at the 13 and 17 age levels, although the genders
measure approximately the same at age 9. At age 17, half of the
males demonstrate an ability to analyze scientific procedures and
data, while only a third of the females have such skills. In the
study of physics, the study said, the gender gap is ``extremely
large'' by the 11th grade.
   Mary Hatwood Futrell, president of the National Education
Association, said the findings ``paint a stark picture of science
education in our nation's schools.''
   ``Scientific understanding is more and more a prerequisite for
informed citizenship,'' said Ms. Futrell. ``If America's citizens
of tomorrow are not scientifically literate, we place our very
democracy at risk.''
   She said that the lower level of science achievement by females
and minority students is the most disturbing of the findings.
   ``By many measures of science proficiency, the inequalities for
both minorities and females actually increase as students move
through the grades,'' she said.
   Shanker, in a statement released by the American Federation of
Teachers, said the findings could be troubling for America's future.
   ``When only a small number of our students can understand basic
scientific concepts, the results are disastrous for the entire
country,'' he said. ``Here we are, one of the great scientific
giants of the world, and almost 60 percent of our successful
17-year-olds don't have the scientific literacy required of
informed citizens.''
   The Science Report Card reinforces results of an international
study released earlier this year that showed American school
children at all levels performed far behind children of the same
age in most of the other 14 nations surveyed.
   The Science Report Card study is financed by the Department of
Education as part of a program called the National Assessment of
Educational Progress. National report cards also are issued in
other subjects as part of the program.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aspiring movie stars thought they would see ghosts
outside a trendy concert hall and restaurant, but instead they saw
red when they learned they were the victims of a hoax.
   More than 100 people showed up Wednesday at the Hard Rock Cafe
in answer to an erroneous call for 2,000 extras to help shoot a
scene for ``Ghostbusters II.''
   ``Who they gonna call? Extras!'' read a newspaper and radio
appeal. ``Ghostbusters director Ivan Reitman said he and his crew
will shoot a scene for the sequel to the hit movie at noon
Wednesday in front of the Hard Rock Cafe on McKinney Avenue in
Dallas.''
   And so a crowd gathered around the restaurant, a large converted
church just north of downtown.
   ``It was a little confusing at first; we weren't really sure
what was going on,'' said Hard Rock cafe manager Colston Burgher.
``They were standing out in the street. Some of them came in. They
said they had heard on the radio that there was a need for extras
to film the movie. I really don't know where the story came from.''
   The story, which turned out to be a hoax, said that Reitman
needed 2,000 extras for the shoot and asked that ``people planning
to attend not wear `outrageous clothes.'''
   The would-be extras said they had heard the appeal on four area
radio stations.
   ``Yes, we did it, but we corrected it,'' said Clint Culp,
manager at one of the radio stations, KTXQ. ``It was a well-placed
hoax.''
   ``Ghostbusters II'' producer Michael Gross said Reitman hasn't
started shooting the movie yet. He said it was not known who was
behind the hoax.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush raided Michael Dukakis'
home turf today to accept the endorsement of a Boston police union
and declared the support would give his campaign ``an enormous
boost.''
   ``Who was it who said the police aren't there when you need
them?'' Bush said. ``They're wrong.''
   The vice president, flanked at a restaurant by about three-dozen
members of the Boston Police Patrolman's Association, accepted the
endorsement voted the day before by the 1,500-member union.
   His motorcade was met outside by several hundred pro-Dukakis
demonstrators chanting ``Bush go home'' and ``Where was George?''
   Inside Bush's supporters had their own chants of ``We want
Bush'' and ``Dump the Duke.'' And one Dukakis backer who _ when
Bush began talking about war on crime _ shouted ``War on Noriega,''
was ejected from the room by police officers.
   In brief remarks, Bush said, ``I'm here not only to accept this
endorsement but to make it clear I'm the one in this race who wants
to strengthen law enforcement.''
   ``My opponent is strongly out of the American mainstream on
issues such as fighting crime,'' the vice president said. ``Your
endorsement is more than an endorsement of me; it's an endorsement
of a philosophy. This is an enormous boost for me.''
   Robert T. Guiney, president of the association, said, ``As
police officers in the capital city of Massachusetts, we know Gov.
Dukakis well and we can state publicly he is no friend of police.''
   The vice president, who is limiting public appearances this week
to prepare for Sunday's presidential debate, spent Wednesday in
briefings with advisers and engaged in a mock debate.
   While aides are working out final logistical details on the
Sunday debate, Bush was taking a break from his preparations today
for the trip to Boston and an appearance with President Reagan in
Houston.
   The Boston visit is the second this month for Bush. He
previously toured Boston Harbor and claimed the Democratic nominee
did little to clean up the heavy pollution in the harbor.
   Police union officials, citing Dukakis' opposition to the death
penalty and his support for a former program granting weekend
furloughs for convicted felons, said they supported Bush because he
would be more attentive to law enforcement needs.
   They also said they were angry the governor had failed to attend
the funerals recently of three police officers killed on duty.
   ``The police officers in this city are upset with the governor
and his policies,'' said Guiney. ``There's a feeling we are taken
for granted.''
   Republican leaders were elated and Bush telephoned his thanks to
several of the union officers.
   ``This sends a message to the whole country that the law
enforcement agency that knows Dukakis best doesn't want him to
become president,'' said Alexander Tennant, executive director of
the state Republican Party.
   Dukakis downplayed the endorsement, citing the association's
``history of supporting Republicans,'' including Reagan in 1980 and
1984.
   Dukakis said he has received backing from other law enforcement
organizations, including the Massachusetts Police Association, the
International Brotherhood of Police Officers and the Combined Law
Enforcement Associations of Texas _ Bush's home state.

<HEAD>Woman Pleads Guilty Eight Years Later</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAYETTEVILLE, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman accused of seducing her lover
into killing her husband has been sentenced to five to 18 years in
prison after the long-time fugitive pleaded guilty to second-degree
murder.
   Naomi Cloud, 45, entered her plea Wednesday in the 1980 shooting
death of her husband, 54-year-old David Cloud, who was shot outside
their Princeton home when the couple returned from a party.
   She had been charged with first-degree murder and faced a
possible life sentence.
   Fayette County Circuit Judge J. Zane Summerfield said Mrs. Cloud
did not confess during her court appearance.
   ``She simply insisted on her constitutional right to enter a
guilty plea rather than run the risk of a jury trial and conviction
on a charge of first-degree murder,'' Summerfield said.
   Her trial had been scheduled to start Monday. The trial had been
moved to Fayette County from Mercer County because of pretrial
publicity.
   Authorities allege Mrs. Cloud lured her boyfriend at the time,
John Elmer Corprew Jr. of Roanoke, Va., into the plot to kill her
husband, and Corprew in turn paid George Guthrie II of Roanoke
$2,500 to be the triggerman.
   Corprew pleaded guilty to a charge that he arranged the killing,
and Guthrie twice was convicted of being the triggerman.
   Prosecutors portrayed Mrs. Cloud as a temptress. Corprew
testified he was Mrs. Cloud's lover and that she was ``a spider and
I was caught in her web. I couldn't get out.''
   Mrs. Cloud jumped bail and fled the state in 1982 just before
she was to stand trial. She was recaptured April 21 in Kennewick,
Wash., after authorities received a tip. She has been held in the
Fayette County Jail without bond since her return to West Virginia.
   Mrs. Cloud contended that her husband was murdered by a masked
assailant who emerged from the darkness outside their home and
demanded money, then fired one shotgun blast.
   Mercer County Prosecutor David Knight questioned why the man
hadn't robbed the house while the Clouds were at the dinner party,
why Mrs. Cloud's life was spared, and why the assailant took no
valuables.
   Corprew was sentenced to five years in prison after pleading
guilty to voluntary manslaughter. Guthrie is serving a life
sentence for first-degree murder.

<HEAD>Mantle Passed To Akihito, Emperor Eats Ice Cubes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crown Prince Akihito assumed all his father's
duties Thursday while 87-year-old Emperor Hirohito, bedridden with
a serious illness, ate two ice cubes and watched sumo wrestling on
television.
   More than 23,000 people, many in suits or kimonos, took up
calligraphy brushes and inked their names on registries set up in
12 sites around the country to wish a speedy recovery to the
world's longest reigning living monarch.
   Chartered buses began bringing hundreds of pilgrims to the gates
of the Imperial Palace in central Tokyo, and priests at Shinto
shrines and Buddhist temples across the country continued their
prayer services.
   Crowds have gathered in front of the palace since Hirohito took
to bed with intestinal hemorrhaging four days ago. Palace officials
said Thursday he remained in serious but stable condition.
   Palace officials said he was receiving oxygen and intravenous
dosages of nutrients and medicine and was under intensive,
round-the-clock care.
   ``We are continuing to regard the situation seriously,'' one
palace official said on condition of anonymity. He said the
emperor's condition has not changed significantly.
   The Japanese government meanwhile protested to two British
tabloid newspapers for their strongly negative coverage of
Hirohito. A recent headline in the Daily Star read, ``Sun Sets on
the God King,'' while the Sun announced: ``Hell's Waiting for This
Truly Evil Emperor.''
   Also Thursday, Japan's finance minister announced he would not
attend a series of international monetary meetings scheduled to
begin in West Berlin this week due to the emperor's illness.
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa was scheduled to leave Friday
afternoon for meetings with the International Monetary Fund and
World Bank. He also was to participate in a meeting of the Group of
Seven: the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France,
Italy and Canada.
   Japan will be represented by Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi
Sumita.
   Palace officials confirmed Thursday that the emperor had eaten
two small ice cubes and had been transferred to a special bed
making medical treatment easier. News reports said he watched
television, including a broadcast of sumo wrestling.
   The Cabinet temporarily passed the imperial mantle to Akihito.
The 54-year-old crown prince assumed part of his father's duties
last September when Hirohito underwent an intestinal bypass
operation.
   ``Taking into consideration the emperor's illness and medical
treatment, we have asked the crown prince to temporarily assume
responsibilities,'' Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi said.
   The duties include placing an official seal on government
appointments and new laws, convocation of parliament and various
ceremonial functions. It was not known whether the crown prince
carried out any of his duties Thursday, but news reports said he
was expected to sign several Cabinet orders on industrial policy on
Friday or Monday.
   Under the Constitution, the emperor has no real power, but he
signs documents already approved by the government and serves as a
symbol of unity for the Japanese people.
   The Imperial Household Agency came under fire for providing only
sketchy reports on the health of the emperor.
   ``Within allowable limits, they should as much as possible give
careful reports,'' chief government spokesman Keizo Obuchi said at
a news conference.
   Obuchi's remarks followed a report in the nationally circulated
Mainichi Shimbun newspaper that the agency's failure to disclose
sufficient information on the emperor's health led to conflicting
reports and was reminiscent of the agency's tight-lipped policy
during the reign of Hirohito's father, the Taisho emperor, who died
on Christmas Day 1926.
   The Imperial Household Agency is the notoriously conservative
guardian of the monarchy's affairs. News briefings on Hirohito's
condition last only a few minutes and invariably exclude
foreigners, although officials answer telephoned queries from
foreign news agencies.
   Officials at the Foreign Ministry said they were pressing the
palace to deliver fuller reports.
   Most other Cabinet ministers canceled plans to leave Tokyo,
including Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno, who was to leave Thursday
for talks with U.S. leaders in Washington. The government has asked
Italian Prime Minister Ciriaco de Mita and Irish leader Charles J.
Haughey to postpone state visits to Japan this month.

<HEAD>BU Changes Some Plans to Help Chelsea Schools</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boston University has backed down in its quest for
near-total control over Chelsea's schools by agreeing to let the
city's School Committee retain some power.
   BU's decision to modify its proposal for a contract to manage
the troubled 3,300-student Chelsea system came after failing to win
a 10-year management pact this summer.
   The university agreed Wednesday night that committee members
could override any of their management decisions by a two-thirds
majority.
   ``This is our best shot,'' said Peter R. Greer, dean of BU's
School of Education.
   But some School Committee members were still reluctant to enter
into a contract with the university. Some felt rushed by the
university's push for a vote.
   ``You expect us to do all this in a week?'' committee member
Elizabeth McBride said after hearing the proposal. ``I think it's a
little much.''
   Chelsea, which is near bankruptcy, has had problems running its
schools efficiently. It also has had trouble raising the average of
students' standardized test scores, which are lower than the state
average.
   Under BU's latest proposal, the university would take over all
aspects of the school system, including negotiating union
contracts, hiring, setting curriculum and developing educational
policy.
   It allows parents and community leaders to serve on two advisory
boards established to aid university representatives, but the
primary governing body would be a BU-controlled board.
   BU and the committee would have the right to terminate the
contract.
   If the committee agrees to the BU proposal, it must be approved
by the city's Board of Aldermen and the state Legislature.

<DATELINE>DILLON, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Vietnamese refugee who battled liver
cancer for nine months got his last wish to see his family emigrate
safely from Vietnam before he died.
   Ton Anh Huynh, 25, had clung to life, hoping for a reunion with
the family he had left behind when he fled Vietnam with his father
and brother in 1979.
   He died Wednesday at the Summit Medical Center in Frisco, just a
week after his mother, two other brothers and two sisters arrived
in Dillon from Vietnam.
   ``I think he kind of held on until the family came. That was
all,'' said Long Anh Huynh, the brother who left Vietnam with
Huynh. ``He was really ill and was getting weaker every day.''
   ``He was very happy and he was still pretty good. He could still
talk and was very happy,'' Long Anh Huynh said.
   Huynh's mother had not been told of her son's illness until she
arrived in Denver. She ``was very upset, but I told her there's not
much we can do,'' Long Anh Huynh said.
   The family spent a ``very good week'' together in the house that
Ton's father bought just two weeks ago, he said.
   Long Anh Huynh said that when his brother's condition worsened
Tuesday night, the family took him to Summit Medical Center.
   Huynh's illness had spurred a long effort by a French
restaurateur in Dillon, Jean Pierre Tournier, to reunite his family.
   Tournier had sponsored Huynh and his father as U.S. citizens,
gave them a place to live and taught them the restaurant business.
By the time Tournier returned to Paris last June, the Vietnamese
government had approved the Huynhs' emigration but set no date for
it.

   Fire broke out on a North Sea drilling

man was reported missing, officials said.
   The Royal Air Force and the Ministry of Defense said 66 of the
67 workers aboard the rig were rescued.
   One of the rescued men suffered minor injuries during the
incident aboard the Ocean Odyssey rig, 138 miles east of Aberdeen,
officials said. The cause of the blaze was not immediately known.
   The rig is operated by the Atlantic Richfield Co. of Los Angeles.

two oil rig supply vessels ... which will take them to Aberdeen,''
a Ministry of Defense spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   Energy Minister Peter Morrison ordered a full investigation into
the fire, which occurred 110 miles southeast of the Piper Alpha
platform where 167 men died July 6.
   The energy department said the Ocean Odyssey, which began
operating at the beginning of this year, passed a safety inspection
last week.
   The Piper Alpha disaster prompted calls for review of safety
procedures in the industry, and the government has recommended
additional safety measures on all oil and gas rigs.
   Royal Air Force spokesman Pat Coffey, a spokesman at a base at
Pitreavie, stressed that the Ocean Odyssey incident was not
``anything like the Piper Alpha.''
   He also denied reports of an explosion. ``The word explosion has
never been used from anybody on the scene, in the air, or from
surface vessels in the vicinity,'' he said.
   The domestic news agency Press Association reported a
``blow-out'' when ``a huge carpet of gas was hit unexpectedly,''
causing fires on both deck and sea levels.
   A spokesman for Atlantic Richfield, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said he could not comment on the cause of the blaze but
reported ``an apparent gas flow at the surface.''
   Reports varied on how many vessels took part in the rescue, but
Royal Air Force Flight Lt. Simon Tonkin, at a base at Kinloss, said
five helicopters, an air force reconnaisance aircraft and the two
supply vessels were involved.
   Coffey said the British warship, the HMS Illustrious, diverted
to the area as it returned from a NATO operation off the coast of
Norway and sent two rescue helicopters ahead to help with the
search.
   The incident occurred as Occidental Oil, the operators of the
Piper platform, prepared to lift parts of the sunken platform from
the seabed.
   Three-quarters of the platform sank in the explosions and fire
that wrecked the rig, and most of the 113 bodies still missing were
thought to be trapped inside the sunken living quarters.
   Occidental plans to salvage two living quarters, one of which is
about the size of a four-story building, and open them in shallow
water off the coast of Scotland. The company expects the lifting to
begin Friday or Saturday.

   A fourth anti-apartheid
activist escaped detention and took refuge in the U.S. Consulate,
where three other activists have been holed up for 10 days, a U.S.
spokesman said today.
   Police issued an arrest warrant for Clifford Ngcobo, who fled
Wednesday while being treated at Johannesburg Hospital and went to
the American consulate on the 11th floor of a downtown Johannesburg
office tower. Authorities later said the warrant had been suspended.
   Ngcobo claims he was assaulted by police the night he was
detained.
   The consulate, which has been providing refuge to three other
activists who escaped last week, decided to allow Ngcobo to remain,
U.S. Embassy spokesman William Zavis said in Pretoria.
   All four detainees escaped guards while undergoing physiotherapy
treatment at Johannesburg Hospital.
   Black activist Winnie Mandela visited the consultate Wednesday
and complained U.S. officials would not let the detainees make
direct contact with reporters.
   The 30-year-old Ngcobo, active in the anti-apartheid Soweto
Civic Association, had been held five months, said attorneys at the
Cheadle, Thompson law firm that represents Ngcobo.
   An affidavit has been filed in which Ngcobo alleges he was
assaulted by police the night of his detention, the attorneys said.
At the recommendation of a doctor, Ngcobo was hospitalized four
days after he was detained, the lawyers added.
   Zavis said he could give no details of the escape nor whether
American diplomats had contacted the South African government about
the newcomer. There was no immediate comment from government
officials.
   ``The South African Police considers (Ngcobo) as an ordinary
accused in a criminal case, and he will be treated in accordance
with normal legal procedure,'' police said.
   Police have not accused Ngcobo of any crime but said they were
investigating charges of illegal possession of weapons and
intimidation.
   Two leaders of the banned United Democratic Front, the country's
largest multiracial anti-apartheid alliance, and another activist
have been inside the consulate since Sept. 13.
   The three, two black men and an ethnic Indian, have issued
statements demanding release of all political detainees and have
refused to leave the consulate despite a promise from the white
minority government that they will not be arrested again or
restricted.
   They have given no indication how long they plan to stay.
   U.S. officials say the activists will not be expelled from the
consulate, despite a worldwide U.S. policy of refusing asylum in
its diplomatic missions.
   Mrs. Mandela, wife of jailed black nationalist leader Nelson
Mandela, visited the activists Wednesday before Ngcobo arrived.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no say in
national affairs.
   In another development, police placed restrictions on three
black activists with the Congress of South African Trade Unions,
the country's largest black labor federation. The three were to
take part in a national anti-apartheid unity conference this
weekend in Cape Town.
   The police orders prohibit the trio from leaving their home
towns and require they remain in their residences from dusk to dawn
through Oct. 3.
   Also, the National Union of Metal Workers of South Africa said
police detained two of their officials Wednesday. Eleven others
expected to participate in the conference were detained Wednesday.
   About 30,000 people have been detained for varying lengths under
the 27-month state of emergency. The government declared the
emergency in an effort to end black protests against apartheid.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan hit the campaign trail for
George Bush today with ridicule for ``born-again Gen. George
Pattons'' in the Democratic Party who say they support a strong
national defense.
   Without mentioning the name of Democratic candidate Michael
Dukakis, the president told a Republican ``Texas Victory '88''
rally that liberal Democrats have had ``a deathbed conversion'' to
GOP positions supporting the submarine-based Trident missile and
the Stealth bomber.
   Reagan was interrupted repeatedly by deafening screams and
applause from about 9,000 Baylor University students who hissed at
the president's frequent mention of liberal Democrats. Signs on the
wall read ``Rock `Em Ron'' and ``Push For Bush.''
   ``When the liberals say `family,' they mean `big brother in
Washington.' When we say `family' we mean `honor thy father and
mother','' Reagan said. The crowd went wild.
   Reagan declared that under his and the vice president's
leadership, ``our nation is again respected in the world, our armed
forces are strong and America is at peace.''
   Reagan was stumping for Bush and Rep. Beau Boulter, R-Texas, who
is seeking the Senate seat of Democratic vice presidential
candidate Lloyd Bentsen, before joining the vice president at
fund-raising dinner in Houston tonight.
   Reagan said he recently vetoed a $299.5 billion defense
authorization bill because he was convinced it would have harmed
U.S. military strength. He then invoked the name of Gen. George
Patton, a crusty and venerable World War II combat hero, in
lambasting the Democratic ticket.
   ``But lately, some liberal leaders have seen what was happening
to them in the polls and had a deathbed conversion,'' he said.
``They'd have you believe that they're born-again Gen. George
Pattons. But if we go the way they want to go, our defenses will
run out of gas in no time.''
   Bush has charged repeatedly that his Democratic rival, the
governor of Massachusetts, was soft on defense issues and would
weaken the national security. Dukakis has said he opposes the
rail-based MX missile and has voiced concerns about how far the
United States should go in deploying B-1 bombers.
   But in an effort to deflect the vice president's criticism,
Dukakis donned a military helmet and took a ride in an M-1 battle
tank last week at a defense contractor's plant in Michigan to
underscore his argument that he believes in a strong military.
   The president said that when Democratic liberals talk of
supporting new weapons systems, ``they whisper that they're also
for delaying deployment of both systems (the Trident and the
Stealth bomber) pending the outcome of arms talks, which could drag
on for years, while the Soviets could be deploying new systems of
their own.''
   Said Reagan: ``They shout loudly that the're for maintaining the
effectiveness of the land-based leg of our strategic (missile)
triad. But they're against the modern missile systems that will be
available for years to come and would like to see an end to the
flight testing needed to develop new systems.''
   On Wednesday, Reagan offered Bush some advice on the vice
president's first nationally televised debate with Dukakis on
Sunday in Winston-Salem, N.C.
   The president told reporters he advised Bush to ``take no
prisoners'' in the face-off at Wake Forest University.
   During today's trip, Reagan also planned to visit the Johnson
Space Center in Houston, where he was to meet with the five
Discovery space shuttle astronauts who are preparing for a Sept. 29
launch.
   His joint appearance with Bush is their second since the vice
president won the GOP presidential nomination in mid-August. Texas,
with its 29 electoral votes and status as Bentsen's home state, is
a pivotal campaign battleground for Bush and Dukakis.
   After Dukakis tapped Bentsen as his running mate, the senator
was allowed to remain on the Texas ballot in his bid for a fourth
Senate term under the so-called ``Lyndon Law,'' which was passed to
allow Lyndon B. Johnson to run simultaneously for re-election to
the Senate and for the vice presidency with John F. Kennedy in 1960.
   Reagan's last visit to the space center was a grim one, coming
only days after the disastrous explosion of the Challenger space
shuttle on Jan. 28, 1986. The Challenger's seven crew members
perished when their spacecraft erupted in a giant fireball only 73
seconds after liftoff.
   At the time, Reagan mourned the loss of ``our seven star
voyagers'' and pledged that America would forge ahead with an
effective and safe space program.
   The president also said Wednesday that he supported Bush's
criticism of Dukakis for vetoing a 1977 bill in Massachusetts that
would have required public school teachers to lead students in
reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. Dukakis has cited an advisory
opinion of the state Supreme Court that the bill was
unconstitutional.
   ``I've seen many children today who don't know what they're
supposed to do when the national anthem is played or when the flag
goes by,'' Reagan told reporters. ``I remember that I learned all
that in school. Why shouldn't they?''
   The president was asked whether teachers should be forced to
lead students in the pledge.
   ``That's what they're there for,'' he shot back. ``Their job is
to teach something.''

<HEAD>Police Continue Crackdown But Withdraw Warrant For Fourth Escaped
Detainee</HEAD>

   Police continued a nationwide
crackdown on government opponents Thursday, but they backtracked on
a detainee who escaped and joined three other activists holed up at
the U.S. Consulate.
   Police issued, then withdrew an arrest warrant for Clifford
Ngcobo, who escaped Wednesday while being treated at a hospital and
fled to the 11th-floor consulate in a downtown Johannesburg office
building.
   Consular officials, who have provided refuge for three prominent
activists since their escape Sept. 13, allowed Ngcobo to remain
while his case is assessed, U.S. Embassy spokesman William Zavis
said.
   Police have pledged not to arrest the three initial escapees if
they leave the consulate, but Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok
said a multipronged crackdown against other activists is under way.
   Across the country this week, more than two dozen activists have
been detained or barred from political activities, offices of
anti-apartheid groups have been raided, and pedestrians and
motorists in urban centers have been subjected to random searches.
   The crackdown comes during an increase in bombings, including
five in a nine-hour span late Wednesday and early Thursday.
Authorities said 38 people were injured, including 18 whites at a
Johannesburg bus terminal and 19 blacks eight hours later at a
disco on the other side of the city.
   The owner of the disco said three white men entered, then left
without drinking any of the beers they had ordered, shortly before
the explosion.
   Police blame most recent bombings on the outlawed African
National Congress, the major guerrilla group fighting
white-minority rule. But activists believe right-wing vigilantes or
a covert security force unit carried out the recent bombing of a
Johannesburg building used by anti-apartheid groups.
   Vlok said the security crackdown was intended to counter an
alleged campaign to disrupt nationwide municipal elections next
month.
   Activists advocate a boycott of the elections and say the
segregated black council seats at stake are components of a
white-controlled system that excludes blacks from central
government.
   Police also have been targeting activists expected to
participate in a national anti-apartheid conference this weekend in
Cape Town. The main sponsor of the conference, the Congress of
South African Trade Unions, said Thursday that eight of its members
were detained and four barred from leaving the Johannesburg area.
   Ngcobo, 30, was active in the anti-apartheid Soweto Civic
Association and had been held since April 23, his attorneys said.
   Ngcobo alleged that he was assaulted by police on the night of
his detention, and he was hospitalized four days after he was
detained, the attorneys said.
   Police issued an arrest warrant for Ngcobo on Thursday and said
he was wanted for illegal weapons possession and intimidation, but
several hours later the Foreign Affairs Department said the warrant
was suspended.
   The department said the case against Ngcobo dealt only with
weapons possession, not with any other alleged offense, and was
referred to the attorney general for consideration.
   Authorities did not elaborate on what would happen to Ngcobo if
he left his refuge.
   The government has said it will act against the three activists
who escaped to the consulate last week.
   They are Murphy Morobe and Mohammed Valli Moosa, leaders of the
banned United Democratic Front, the country's largest
anti-apartheid coalition, and Vusi Khanyile, chairman of the banned
National education Crisis Committee.
   The three eluded guards while receiving physiotherapy at
Johannesburg Hospital, the same facility that Ngcobo escaped from.
   The three have called for the release of all political detainees
and have refused to leave the consulate despite the government
assurances.
   U.S. officials say the activists will not be expelled from the
consulate despite a worldwide policy of not granting asylum in U.S.
diplomatic missions.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   Voters' doubts about George Bush and Michael
Dukakis are such that, despite Bush's recent strength in the
presidential race, the debates between the two men will prove
critical, analysts of a new poll suggested Thursday.
   ``We consider this contest still a very close one,'' said Andrew
Kohut, president of the Gallup Organization, which conducted the
poll for the Times Mirror Corp.
   The poll suggested that Bush has gained in the presidential race
more by solidifying his support among Republicans and
Republican-leaning independents than by siphoning off Democrats
from Dukakis.
   ``He has performed in a way that has caused Republicans to come
home,'' analyst Norman Ornstein said at a news conference where the
poll results were released.
   Kohut said Bush ``has won the first round of this campaign and
seized the momentum,'' but that support for both men was ``soft,''
with many people who expressed a preference saying they might
switch to the opponent.
   Ornstein, of the American Enterprise Institute, said Bush was
vulnerable on the Iran-Contra affair and on the administration's
handling of drug charges against Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio
Noriega, with the Noriega question ``more significant to people''
than any other issue.
   Bush's criticism of Dukakis' prison furlough program ``resounds
with more voters than any other charges'' against the Massachusetts
governor, Ornstein said.
   Voters are also sensitive to Dukakis' veto of a bill that would
have required the Pledge of Allegiance in Massachusetts schools,
not because it raises questions about Dukakis' patriotism, but
because the public thinks his judgment was wrong, Kohut said.
   The poll analysis called Bush's running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of
Indiana, ``the achilles heel of the Republicans'' because of doubts
about his qualifications. While Quayle did not appear to be an
issue on which votes were swinging directly, Ornstein said Quayle
would be ``more of an issue than the overall numbers suggest'' as
``a symbol of George Bush's judgment combined with Noriega and
Iran-Contra.''
   ``Given the doubts ... whether either candidate has the judgment
to be a good president ... these debates are either going to
reinforce doubts or erase doubts about their judgment,'' Ornstein
said. ``I think the debates are critical.''
   Bush and Dukakis have their first debate Sunday in
Winston-Salem, N.C., their second on Oct. 13 or 14 in Los Angeles.
   The poll suggested that Bush has advanced his cause by painting
Dukakis as ideologically out of step, and he has benefited from
increased voter satisfaction with the nation's course and
confidence in the economy.
   But while Bush has drawn some conservative Democrats to his
side, he has lost ground among other Democratic-oriented groups,
said Gallup's analysis.
   It said the more significant movement was Bush's greater support
from Republicans in general, and particularly from
Republican-leaning, blue-collar conservatives identified in the
survey as ``disaffected'' voters.
   ``For all the talk of the importance of the Reagan Democrats,
this analysis suggests that the most significant dynamic in recent
weeks has been the return of Republicans to the fold _ with
disaffecteds showing the largest proportionate swing,'' Gallup's
analysis said.
   The ``disaffecteds,'' set apart by their suspicion of
government, made up about a tenth of the registered voters in the
poll. They went from a nearly even division on Bush and Dukakis in
May to backing Bush by 61 percent to 27 percent this month, Gallup
said.
   The poll defines the electorate by grouping voters with shared
values, rather than through the more traditional measures of
political party identification or ideology.
   Bush has made inroads only in the most conservative Democratic
groups, Kohut said, and he lost ground among another Democratic
group, ``seculars,'' who are non-religious and put an emphasis on
personal freedom.
   A pro-Dukakis group, the liberal ``'60s Democrats,'' supports
Dukakis more strongly now, apparently in reaction to Bush's
ideologically based attacks.
   At the same time, core Republican groups support Bush almost
unanimously, and in each ``there has been a dramatic increase in
the proportion who say they support Bush strongly,'' Gallup's
analysis said. As a result, it said, ``It is clear that the main
effect of the Bush efforts has been to solidify his base among
Republican-oriented groups.''
   Overall, Bush was supported by 50 percent in the poll of 2,001
registered voters to 44 percent for Dukakis. The survey, done Sept.
9-14, had a margin of error of three percentage points, so Bush's
lead was not statistically meaningful. But, in this as in other
polls, Bush had trailed badly before the Republican convention in
August.

<HEAD>Governor's Mother Challenging Incumbent For Son's Former Seat</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs 13th graf, ``Mrs. McCrery,'' to CORRECT ``Mrs. McCrery''

<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Jim McCrery got the backing of
Gov. Buddy Roemer when he ran for Roemer's former congressional
seat, but now that he's seeking re-election his major opponent is
Roemer's mother.
   Adeline Roemer says she entered the race because she's
disappointed with the incumbent's brief performance in Congress.
   McCrery, a Republican who formerly worked as a top aide to
Roemer when Roemer was congressman, called the challenge in the
Oct. 1 open primary ``quite awkward and quite uncomfortable,'' but
said he's confident of winning his first full two-year term.
   McCrery won a runoff in April to fill the rest of Roemer's
unexpired term. Roemer, a Democrat who was elected four times to
the 4th District seat, took office as governor on March 15.
   ``I voted for Jim McCrery in the runoff,'' said Mrs. Roemer, 64,
a Democrat.
   ``While I felt there were two good people in the runoff, I felt
I knew Jim better. ... I thought he would vote across party lines
in the best interests of the people of the district. I do not feel
that has been the case,'' she said.
   A third primary candidate, Robert Briggs, has only a small
political base. If neither Mrs. Roemer nor McCrery wins a majority
the two top vote-getters will be forced into a runoff.
   Name recognition in Mrs. Roemer's favor hasn't hurt his
campaign, McCrery said.
   ``I have lost a few of the Roemer people who voted for me last
time because of their allegiance to Buddy and his mother. But they
are few in number,'' he said.
   Mrs. Roemer, who described herself as a lifelong political
activist most concerned with persuading qualified people to run for
office, said McCrery cast a couple of votes ``that put up little
red flags'' _ including opposition to a 60-day notification for
plant closings and a catastrophic health care bill.
   ``I felt like he has cast a straight party line vote even when
it hurt his district and it would not have hurt his standing in the
Republican Party for him to have voted differently,'' she said.
   The incumbent said he voted against the plant closing provision
because it could have pushed small businesses into bankruptcy and
would have discouraged expansion. He said the health care bill
``was not in the best interest of the district.''
   Mrs. Roemer said she decided to enter the race because no strong
candidate was emerging to challenge McCrery. ``I walked down the
levee and through the cotton fields and decided I would run.''
   It certainly wasn't the governor's idea, she said.
   ``When I called him up on that Saturday morning and told him I
planned to run for Congress and asked him if that would cause him
any problems, there was dead silence,'' she said. ``When he came
back on, he said `Mom, are you serious?'''
   Roemer and his wife, Patti, recently appeared at a $1,000 per
couple fund-raiser for his mother. Last spring, the governor drew
the ire of state Democrats when he supported McCrery.
   McCrery, whose campaign raised about $80,000 with a fundraiser
featuring retired Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, a major figure in
the Iran-Contra controversy, said he has done in Congress exactly
what he promised to do.
   ``No. 1 is what is in the best interest of the United States.
No. 2 is what is in the best interest of the district. I said that
during the last campaign,'' he said.
   McCrery, 38, said he hopes the race will not have negative
effects on the district.
   ``I have supported Buddy Roemer for a number of years and hope
to continue to support his efforts to turn around the economy of
Louisiana,'' he said.

<HEAD>Moscow Opera Conductor Tells Reasons for Defecting</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A conductor of Moscow's Bolshoi Opera said
Thursday he defected to America because his outspoken doubts about
Soviet politics made him a second-class citizen and hampered his
work in his own country.
   ``While we were trying to build one type of society in the
Soviet Union, we were in fact building one very different, one in
which it was very difficult to live and in which there was little
hope for the future,'' said Ruben Z. Vartanyan, who sought asylum
at the U.S. embassy in Bolivia last week while visiting that nation.
   ``I am an outspoken person,'' Vartanyan told a Washington news
conference. ``I could not disguise my feelings,'' Vartanyan said,
and he believes that ``informers reported back to the authorities.''
   Vartanyan said he first experienced trouble on his return to
Moscow in 1976 after a stay of nearly six years in Bolivia, where
he was the principal conductor of the National Symphonic Orchestra
in La Paz.
   Although he was never charged or openly accused of disloyalty to
the Soviet Union, he was unable to find a permanent post for four
years after his return.
   The situation improved slightly after he wrote a letter to
Leonid I. Brezhnev, who was then the Soviet president, and from
1980 until his defection Vartanyan was one of several conductors at
the Bolshoi Opera in Moscow, conducting more that 500 performances.
   Vartanyan met last week with Mstislav Rostropovich, another
Soviet defector, who is now director of the National Symphony in
Washington. The two were acquainted years ago in the Soviet Union,
when Vartanyan was principal conductor of the Armenian State
Symphony in Yerevan.
   Rostropovich was unfamiliar with Vartanyan's work and had no
comment on the defection, said a spokeswoman for Rostropovich.
   ``They had been very much out of touch and Mr. Rostropovich did
not know that Mr. Vartanyan was conducting at the Bolshoi. He did,
however, recognize his face,'' said the spokeswoman, Nadya Efremov.
   Vartanyan, whose defection was disclosed Wednesday, has not
received any invitations to work in the United States, but told
reporters: ``I am an optimist.''
   The Soviet conductor said that he had great respect for Kremlin
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his attempts to reform Soviet
society. Although there have been improvements in literature, film
and theater, ``in music, things are the opposite,'' said Vartanyan.
   ``The political leadership is not as interested in music as they
are in literature and film,'' he said.
   The world of Soviet music is run by ``the same people in the
ministries and the (Communist Party) Central Committee who have sat
there for the past 20 years. It is impossible for them to change,''
he said.
   The Bolshoi Theater, which includes an opera and a ballet
company, remains a political fiefdom where the level of artistic
discussion ``can be compared to any graveyard in Moscow,'' and the
director fires those who disagree with him, he said.
   ``I do not consider myself a traitor or a defector,'' he said.
But ``I felt I was under suspicion and did not have the confidence
of the people who ran the musical world. They did not have
confidence in my political views.''
   Because of that, he said, he was considered ``a second class
citizen'' and ``a member of the lowest category'' of society.
   Vartanyan said that his only close relative in the Soviet Union
was a sister. His wife died two years ago, they had no children,
and his parents are deceased, he said.

   New Hampshire voters prefer Republican
George Bush over Democrat Michael Dukakis by a better than 2-1
margin, a new presidential poll indicates.
   Fifty-eight percent of the 397 likely New Hampshire voters
surveyed favored Bush and 26 percent support Dukakis, according to
the University of New Hampshire poll conducted for the Boston Globe
and station WMUR-TV in Manchester.
   Dukakis faces a tough race in the state because Republicans edge
Democrats in voter registration, according to university pollster
David Moore.
   The telephone poll, conducted Sept. 14-18, has a margin of error
of four percentage points.

<TEXT>
   Terry Povah is up to his
warehouse ceiling in sweatshirts, coffee mugs, fishing tackle and
thousands of other items normally carted home by tourists during a
typical Yellowstone summer.
   But the summer of '88 was far from typical in the country's
first national park.
   Forest fires that raged over half of Yellowstone National Park's
2.2 million acres meant evacuation and early closure of many
facilities. It also meant the hasty exit of thousands of visitors
who ordinarily would crowd the aisles of Povah's 15 retail stores
past Labor Day.
   ``Will I have to re-order inventory for next year? God, I hope
not!'' said Povah, 43, president of his family's Hamilton Stores
Inc., the oldest concessioner under the jurisdiction of the
National Park Service.
   ``First we had the Great Depression, then World War II, then the
'59 earthquake, then the Arab oil embargo, then the '76 Teton Dam
disaster, and now the fires. There are always hurdles in the road.
This is just another one. I try to be philosophical.
   ``Wanna buy a T-shirt cheap?''
   Povah's quip is typical of the kind of humor he says has helped
his family cope with Mother Nature and Washington bureaucrats
during the nearly three quarters of a century Hamilton Stores has
been in Yellowstone.
   ``We basically fly with one eye open anyway,'' said Povah.
``Who's to say in August of '88 that we won't have a gas shortage
in July of '89 and the tourists won't come anyway? The company
philosophy is conservative. That means we have a 72-year history of
annual crapshoots.''
   Povah's grandfather, Charles Ashworth Hamilton, arrived in
Montana by train in 1905 from St. Paul, Minn., and went to work for
the Yellowstone Park Association, which then ran the commissary.
   Through three generations of its owners' grit, hunches, neck
protrusion and luck, Hamilton Stores, which formally began in 1915
when its founder bought out a retiring storekeeper at Old Faithful,
has grown into a multimillion-dollar operation.
   Today Hamilton Stores concessions are scattered throughout the
park. They include service stations, snack bars, grocery and
general merchandise stores, and camera shops. They also provide 12
dormitories for their 800 summer employees.
   Povah says his family will remember this year for a long time.
   ``It was wild,'' he said, shaking his head. ``In May and June we
were doing a tremendous business, so in July we heavily re-ordered.
Then the fires came.
   ``We didn't lose any facilities but we had smoke-damaged
merchandise and a helluva lot of inconvenience.''
   He even spent a few days helping fight fires with his company's
two fire trucks.
   ``There'd be a power outage and we'd be running around trying to
save ice cream. Then Old Faithful was threatened and we were
shuffling all the merchandise around,'' Povah said.
   Povah recalled the night he and his three children, headed home
to West Yellowstone from the park, got cut off and had to wait it
out while hundreds of firefighters fought one of the biggest blazes.
   ``The kids were saying `Uh, Dad, I think you should turn around'
and I looked to see flames everywhere,'' said Povah. ``I tried to
say `No problem' but I was a little worried.''
   So how's Povah going to relax after such a stressful summer?
   ``I'm going to take a bus from Tibet to Nepal over
18,000-foot-high mountain passes,'' he said. ``That should prepare
me for next summer in Yellowstone.''

   A shooting that began in an auto parts store and
ended at a school nearby left five dead today and at least two
wounded, authorities said.
   A woman police officer, two employees of the store and a school
janitor died, and the gunman also was killed, said fire department
spokesman Tom Sheppard.
   ``We had a shootout,'' said Thelma Catto, a payroll clerk at the
Montefiore School. ``Right now, my office is a pool of blood.''
   Officials said the shooting was not school-related, though the
West Side school is a special one for troubled boys. It is about a
half-block from the store.
   Scott LaGreca, a spokesman for the Chicago fire department, said
the incident began with an attempted holdup at the store and the
gunman was chased into the school.
   But police said later that robbery was not the motive. ``It
appears to be somebody who has a grudge,'' said police Commander
James Maurer.
   Classes at the school, which has an enrollment of about 135,
were in session at the time of the shooting but no students or
teachers were injured, said school Superintendent Manford Byrd.
Social workers were sent to the school to help students cope with
the incident.
   Detective Riccardo Abreu said there was no evidence that anyone
was involved in the incident except for the gunman who died.
   In addition to the five dead, a second police officer was
injured, said deputy chief John Walsh of the Chicago Police
Department. And a hospital reported treating a man whose occupation
was not immediately determined.
   The second police officer was shot in both legs, Sheppard said.
A spokesman for Mount Sinai Hospital said the officer was in
serious but stable condition at the hospital.
   The shooting began at the Comet Auto Parts store, witnesses and
officials said.
   ``Shots apparently happened outside the school,'' said Chicago
School Board spokesman Bob Saigh. ``I understand the individual was
pursued into the building and more shots were fired.
   ``It is not school-related,'' Saigh said.
   Ms. Catto said she heard shots and ducked under her desk. One
school employee, whom she would only describe as a custodian, was
shot and came into her office.
   ``I hid in the storeroom,'' she said.
   A man who lives near the school, Kenny McBroom, 26, said he
witnessed much of the incident trough the window of his home.
   ``After the shots had been fired, I went to the window,''
McBroom said. ``I saw one cop laying down. He was shot but not
dead.''
   Other police officers arrived and ``came out with one policeman
who had been shot in the head and another one with bloodstains on
his chest. They were not moving,'' McBroom said.
   Four victims were brought to Cook County Hospital, according to
Wanda Robertson, a hospital spokeswoman. Three were taken
immediately to the trauma unit, which handles the most serious
medical emergencies.
   All three died at the trauma unit, she said. The Cook County
medical examiner's office said the other two dead persons
apparently died at the scene.
   Saigh identified the dead custodian as Arthur Baker. Ms.
Robertson said he was 33, and said the other two who died at the
hospital were Irma Ruiz, no age or occupation, and an unidentified
man.
   The wounded officer at Mount Sinai was identified as Greg
Jaglowski, 38. The other wounded person, brought to Cook County,
was Leplace Chestnut, 34, who was shot in the hand and was in good
condition, Ms. Robertson said.
   She didn't know if Ms. Ruiz or Chestnut were police officers.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 26th New York Film Festival turns its lens
this year on emerging cinema talents and on maverick filmmakers who
make personal statements with their works, including such
well-known talents as Clint Eastwood and John Cassavetes.
   The annual film fete, which opens Friday at Lincoln Center with
Pedro Almodovar's ``Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,''
features more works by women directors than ever before.
   It also marks the festival debut of actor-director Eastwood, who
is bringing ``Bird,'' his graceful and evocative story of the great
saxophonist, Charlie Parker, and the return of the innovative
Cassavetes with ``Opening Night,'' a shattering drama about an
actress who is deeply affected by the death of a fan.
   Eastwood is typical of those festival filmmakers whose works
reflect a personal statement. ``Bird'' was a labor of love.
   Devoted to jazz since his youth when he listened to his mother's
Fats Waller records, he played piano and later the flugelhorn. When
he was a teen-ager, Eastwood played at a club in Oakland, Calif.
   ``It was an influential time for me and when I first heard
Charlie Parker I was overwhelmed,'' he said in an interview.
``Those early records were just dazzling. A lot of people didn't
understand it.''
   ``Bird'' won two awards at this year's Cannes Film Festival,
including best actor for Forest Whitaker, who portrays the jazz
great, and a special prize for the picture's craftsmanship.
   Cassavetes last appeared at the film festival with ``A Woman
Under the Influence'' in 1974. ``Closing Night,'' starring his
wife, Gena Rowlands, was made in 1978 but never commercially
released.
   ``The type of films we do are different,'' the
director-actor-writer once said in an interview with The Associated
Press. ``Commercial movies have no feeling, no sensitivity. Most
people tell me that people won't understand films with feeling. But
everyone can feel.
   ``I think people have an understanding of what their life is. I
define success by being a realist and not humiliating people. I'm a
revolutionary, but not in the political sense.''
   More than 400 films were screened by the festival's selection
committee, whose new chairman is Richard Pena, a director of the
Chicago Film Center. He is an outspoken advocate of Third World
cinema.
   His replacement of former director Richard Roud caused a stir in
film circles and on the selection committee itself, with some
critics pulling out. Roud was ousted because of personal
disagreements between him and other members of the Film Society of
Lincoln Center. Pena said Roud still works with the film society.
   ``Women on the Verge,'' a wacky vision of love starring Carmen
Maura, is the Spanish director's festival debut. His comedies,
``What I Done to Deserve This?'' and ``Law of Desire,'' previously
were hits at the New Directors-New Film series in 1985 and '87.
   The festival closes Oct. 9 with ``Red Sorghum,'' the directorial
debut of Zhang Yimou, the award-winning cinematographer of ``Yellow
Earth'' and ``The Big Parade.'' In ``Red Sorghum,'' he presents a
semi-biographical story of his grandparents and China in the 1930s.
   Women directors represented this year include: Mira Nair,
``Salaam Bombay!'' about a 10-year-old boy's survival on the
streets of Bombay; Jackie Burroughs, Louise Clark and Aerlyn
Weissman, ``A Winter Tan,'' the story of a sexually obsessed school
teacher; Christel Buschmann, Helke Sander, Helma Sanders-Brahms and
Margarethe von Trotta, ``Felix'' a comedy about a German Casanova;
Fiorella Infascelli, ``La Maschera''; Catherine Breillat, ``36
Fillette,'' about a sexual provocative teen-age girl; Laurie
Dunphy, ``Lived in Quotes,'' and Chick Strand, ``Fake Fruit
Factory.''
   The film festival also will focus on the new British cinema,
Soviet cinema in the age of glasnost, the new Asian cinema and the
new American independents.
   British works are represented by three directors whose works are
highly personal and court realism: Mike Leigh, ``High Hopes,''
about class tensions in the Thatcher administration; Derek Jarman,
``The Last of England,'' about Western civilization on the brink of
the Apocalypse; and Terence Davies, ``Distant Voices, Still
Lives,'' about a family's troubled life.
   Sergei Paradjanov, who with Andrei Tarkovsky, is considered
among the most important Soviet directors in decades, will have the
New York premiere of his ``Ashik Kherib.'' He had been forbidden to
work in the cinema for 15 years.
   Two other Soviet films are being shown as retrospective pieces:
``The Onset of an Unknown Age,'' made two decades ago to
commemorate the October Revolution; and ``Asya's Happiness,''
directed by Andrei Konchalovsky, a film Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev has called one of the best movies he's seen in years.
   Other festival entries include:
   _ Marcel Ophuls' ``Hotel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus
Barbie,'' about the Nazi war criminal.
   _ ``Jacob,'' the first Romanian film to be shown at the
festival, directed by Mircea Daneliuc.
   _ ``Mapantsula,'' a South African film directed by Oliver
Schmitz and told from the black perspective.
   _ ``Golub,'' a documentary on the Expressionist painter Leon
Golub.
   _ ``Hard Times,'' the festival debut of Portuguese director Joao
Botelho.
   _ ``A Man With Three Coffins,'' the festival's first Korean film.
   _ Hou Hsaio-hsien's ``Daughter of the Nile.''
   The festival also will present 16 animated and experimental
shorts including the Daffy Duck cartoon ``Night of the Living
Duck.''

   The nation's savings institutions lost $7.5
billion in the first half of this year, the government reported
Thursday, as a Senate leader called for the biggest federal bailout
in history.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said S&Ls lost $3.6 billion in
the April-June quarter, a modest improvement over the $3.9 billion
loss of the first quarter.
   Nevertheless, the industry in only the first half of the year is
already approaching the post-Depression record loss of $7.8 billion
for all of 1987.
   Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire, D-Wis., who
is retiring after building a reputation as a penny-pinching
legislator during 31 years in office, said Thursday that the next
Congress will have to appropriate at least $20 billion _ about $81
for every man, woman and child in the country _ to bail out the
industry.
   And healthy S&Ls, which have been paying to close or merge
failed institutions so far, will have to contribute an additional
$30 billion, he said.
   ``It is with reluctant but profound conviction that I rise to
state ... the next Congress will be required to appropriate at
least $20 billion,'' Proxmire said in a speech prepared for
delivery on the Senate floor.
   ``The bailout-to-come will be the largest ever in the history of
the U.S. It will be far bigger than the combined cost of the
assistance ... to Chrysler (Corp.), Lockheed (Corp.) and New York
City,'' he said.
   The bank board report and Proxmire's statement came within a
week of several new _ and larger than previous _ estimates of the
cost of cleaning up the thrift industry.
   The General Accounting Office, Congress auditing arm, says it
will cost $45 billion to $50 billion. The American Bankers
Association, the trade group for commercial banks, says $74 billion
and some private analysts put the cost as high as $100 billion. The
bank board says it intends in October to raise its $31 billion
projection.
   Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady on Wednesday
directed a top deputy, Undersecretary George D. Gould, to
independently assess the conflicting estimates.
   That would be the first step in a possible re-evaluation of the
administration's stance, which has been that the Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corp. has as much money as it can efficiently
spend well into next year.
   At a time when the administration is struggling to reduce the
federal budget deficit, the question of how much must be spent on
S&Ls is becoming increasingly critical.
   Since mid-August alone, the bank board has pledged nearly $13
billion in assistance to resolve the cases of more than 50
institutions. Because FSLIC lacks the cash to complete rescue
packages, its aid is coming in the form of prommissory notes and
guarantees against certain kinds of future loss.
   According to figures released last week at a House Banking
Committee hearing, FSLIC has more than $19 billion in outstanding
commitments. Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, said the commitments, which
have been made without congressional approval, threaten to create a
``Constitutional cataclysm.''
   Proxmire accused Brady of being ``nonchalant'' about the problem
and said, ``The administration has its head buried in the sand.''
In turn, Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, the senior Republican on the
committee, criticized the ``sanctimonious attempts'' of colleagues
to blame the administration and said he was ``outraged by repeated
efforts to get the U.S. taxpayers to pick up the tab.''
   Bank board economist James Barth said he detected some signs of
improvement in the latest financial report. Net losses declined for
the second quarter in a row, from the record three-month loss of $4
billion in September-December 1987.
   The number of insolvent institutions among 3,092 reporting
slipped from 509 to 497, and the percentage of money-losing
institutions declined slightly from 31 percent to 29 percent.
   ``I like to think we have bottomed out and things won't get much
worse,'' Barth said.
   He declined to offer an assessment of how the industry is faring
in the current quarter, but he noted that about $800 million of the
second quarter loss occurred at 60 institutions that have since
been closed.
   As in the past, the industry's losses in the second quarter were
concentrated in a relatively small number of institutions and in
one state _ Texas, which has been hard hit by the collapse of oil
prices.
   The 271 thrift institutions in Texas accounted for $3.2 billion
of the loss. The 20 worst institutions in the nation _ 17 of them
in Texas _ lost $2.6 billion.

   A jet airplane engine blew up today
while being worked on near the aeronautics shop at a community
college, injuring three students, one seriously, police reported.
   The blast happened at about 9:15 a.m. in a fenced-in test area
outside the aeronautics lab at the College of San Mateo, said San
Mateo police Sgt. Phil Derr.
   Derr said four students were working on the jet turbine when it
malfunctioned, went out of control and spun into very high
revolutions, finally blowing apart and sending shards of metal
flying around the area.
   The seriously hurt student was a 20-year-old man who was hit on
the legs. He was admitted to Mills Hospital. The other two received
lesser injuries, also from bits of metal hurled from the exploding
engine. None of the victims was immediately identified.
   Campus police dispatcher Beth Shireman said campus and San Mateo
police were investigating the blast. She said no details were
available on any structures that might have been damaged by the
blast.
   The campus, about 15 miles south of San Francisco, is part of
the California community college system.

   Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias told
Congress Thursday he was confident his government and the United
States can reach agreement on U.S. military bases in Greece, a
congressional source said.
   The foreign minister also said Greek authorities would not free
a Palestinian they are holding on false passport charges until it
settles a U.S. extradition request for him to face murder charges
arising from a 1982 airliner bombing near Hawaii, said the source.
   Papoulias spoke in a closed session of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, and the source discussed the meeting on condition he not
be identified.
   Papoulias reiterated Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's terms
for a new military base agreement that include ending U.S.
operations at Hellenikon and not transferring them to any of the 23
other American installations in Greece, the source said.
   Hellenikon is a logistics base at Athens International Airport
and U.S. officials have called it a central issue in the
negotiations that Greece says will restart in two weeks in Athens.
The existing five-year agreement gives U.S. forces 18 months to
leave if a new accord is not reached by Dec. 21.
   Rep. Gus Yatron, D-Ohio, told Papoulias the American public
would be upset if Greece frees Mohammed Rashid, an admitted
Palestine Liberation Organization operative. Rashid is serving a
seven-month sentence for entering Greece May 30 using a forged
Syrian passport that he said was provided by PLO superiors.
   Rashid, 34, has denied U.S. charge of planting a bomb on a Pan
American World Airways jetliner in 1982, causing an explosion over
Hawaii that killed a Japanese teenager and injured 15 other people.

   President Amin Gemayel said he was
leaving office at the end of his 6-year-term at midnight tonight
and would hand power to an interim government. Parliament failed
today to elect a new head of state.
   Gemayel did not name members of the new interim cabinet.
Presidential palace sources said the cabinet will be announced
later in a presidential decree.
   ``I leave the presidency today worried and filled with
anxiety,'' Gemayel told the nation in a five-minute farewell
address televised nationwide.
   ``The constitutional authority should have passed through the
free will of parliament members to a president who enjoys the
confidence of the people,'' he said.
   Gemayel's delegation of power to an interim government defies a
warning by the nation's Moslem religious leaders that such a move
would partition Lebanon.
   Earlier today, fighting broke out along the city's dividing
Green Line, and state radio said gunmen killed two senior
commanders of the mainstream Shiite Moslem Amal militia.
   Christians and Moslems have been fighting a civil war for the
past 13 years, ravaging the once prosperous economy of this nation
and dividing the country into factions controlled by bands of
guerrillas.
   Under an unwritten national covenant dating from independence in
1943, the Lebanese president must be a Maronite Christian, the
prime minister a Sunni Moslem and the Parliament speaker a Shiite
Moslem.
   Daoud Daoud and Mahmoud Fakih, top Amal officers for southern
Lebanon, were killed ``instantly'' when a rocket-propelled grenade
hit the car they were riding in on the Ouzai highway, the broadcast
said. The highway is in Syrian-policed south Beirut.
   Daoud and Fakih, whose Amal Shiite movement is backed by Syria,
led a crackdown on pro-Iranian Shiite fundamentalists in south
Lebanon earlier this year. That operation ousted the extremist
Hezbollah, or Party of God, from most of the southern villages.
   Shell explosions and bursts of gunfire echoed across Beirut
after the Parliament speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite Moslem, put
off voting for 24 hours.
   Police said one Christian militiaman was killed and two soldiers
of the regular army's predominantly Shiite Moslem 6th Brigade were
wounded in mortar and machine gun duels near the old Parliament
headquarters.
   Moslems have said that if Gemayel appoints a Christian to be
prime minister, they will declare their own republic in territory
they control. That would formalize the breakup of Lebanon into
rival sectarian mini-states.
   Former President Charles Helou said after meeting with Gemayel
the new prime minister would probably be ``a member of the Helou
clan.'' It was an apparent reference to his cousin, Pierre Helou, a
Maronite Catholic businessman who maintains close ties with several
Moslem leaders.
   Three Christians are standing for election to replace the
Maronite president. Syria backs two of them: former President
Suleiman Franjieh, 78, and 58-year-old Parliament Deputy Mikhail
Daher.
   The third, veteran politician Raymond Edde, has been living in
self-imposed exile in Paris for 12 years after escaping three
assassination attempts in Lebanon.
   Edde, 75, is the most popular in public opinion polls. But
Daher's chances appear stronger in Parliament because he is backed
by the United States as well as Syria, Lebanon's main power broker.
Damascus has 40,000 troops in the country.
   Militant Christians have rejected both Daher and Franjieh,
charging they would allow Lebanon to become a Syrian satellite and
give Moslems too much power in the government.

<HEAD>Baltimore Mayor Says Legalize Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BETH J. HARPAZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Decriminalizing heroin and crack would remove
the profit from the drug trade, reduce street crime, and ease the
burden on the legal system, Baltimore Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke said
Thursday.
   ``I'd like to see leading the war on drugs, the surgeon general,
not the attorney general,'' Schmoke said at a debate sponsored by
the New York Board of Trade and held before 100 business
executives, students, and journalists.
   Schmoke, whose support of decriminalization caused a stir at the
U.S. Conference of Mayors in April, plans to testify Sept. 29 at a
congressional hearing on the issue.
   ``I was a prosecutor for 7{ years and I know what I'm talking
about,'' Schmoke said. ``As long as we continue doing what we're
doing, children are going to be lured into the drug trade and dirty
needles are going to kill people. I want to treat people with the
disease called addiction as patients, not as criminals.
   ``You have to reallocate those resources to the public health
system, toward education, treatment and prevention,'' he added.
   He also called for a national commission that would examine
prescription and illegal drugs, alcohol and cigarettes to determine
the most effective way to regulate each.
   Schmoke shared the dais with Georgette Bennett, a
decriminalization advocate whose 1987 book ``Crimewarps'' about
future crime trends was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.
   Opposing them were Robert A. Stutman, a special agent with the
Drug Enforcement Agency, and the New York State Director of
Substance Abuse Services, Julio A. Martinez, who founded the
Phoenix House drug rehabilitation program.
   Martinez showed the audience a bottle of multicolored pills, a
container of liquid methadone and a bottle of brandy as examples of
substances that are widely abused even though they are legal.
   Stutman disagreed with Schmoke's assertion that Prohibition was
a failure. Stutman noted a decline in alcoholism and cirrhosis of
the liver during the Prohibition years, while Schmoke said making
alcohol illegal gave rise to organized crime and deprived the
government of tax revenue.

<DATELINE>SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Decades of racism and black unemployment
made it inevitable that Shreveport would see an outbreak of
violence like this week's rock-throwing and arson following the
killing of a black man, a civil rights leader says.
   ``Shreveport's been dodging the bullet for 25 years,'' said
Larry English of the local NAACP chapter.
   The violence Tuesday and Wednesday nights, set off when a white
woman shot a black man, was confined to a few blocks in Cedar
Grove, a mostly residential neighborhood of modest houses and small
businesses about six miles from downtown.
   Police spokeswoman Cindy Chadwick said no problems were reported
in Cedar Grove after dozens of heavily armed Special Response Team
officers left the area early Thursday.
   Police took down roadblocks that sealed off the area for about
four hours Wednesday night, but Chadwick said beefed up patrols
were ready to seal off the area again if violence resumed.
   The rioting was set off by the killing Tuesday night of William
David McKinney, 22. A 17-year-old white girl was arrested and
officials said the shooting followed a drug deal that went bad,
with the victim an innocent bystander.
   Black leaders said another factor was anger over the killing of
a black teen-ager by a white teen-ager at a restaurant last month.
   And, they said, there was lingering frustration over the recent
acquittal in west Texas of three law officers accused in the
beating death of a Florien, La., black man arrested last Christmas
Day on suspicion of drunk driving.
   But those three incidents were only catalysts, black leaders
said.
   The Rev. E. Edward Jones, president of the National Baptist
Convention and a long-time Shreveport civil rights leader, blamed
long-standing ``institutional racism'' for the trouble. But he
warned blacks against violence.
   ``Destruction is not the way. We need reasoning and logic,''
said Jones.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson blamed the unrest on poverty and
illiteracy.
   ``They've had too much access to guns and drugs and too little
access to jobs, to scholarships,'' Jackson said in Baton Rouge.
   ``In that city today, we must make the appeal for the haves and
the have nots, the black and the white to come together and study
war no more,'' Jackson said.
   Classes at Caddo Parish schools near the riot area continued
without interruption, although Assistant Superintendent Ealie
Thornton said absences would be excused if parents decided to keep
their children home.
   The School Board said security would be beefed up at this
weekend's high school football games, where there have been
occasional race-related problems over the years. But board official
David Barr said the security was planned before the Cedar Grove
incident because of a rash of minor stadium crimes.
   Tuesday's violence centered around a small grocery where the
white shooting suspect and her companion fled after McKinney was
shot. The grocery and a neighboring liquor store were gutted by
fire and a television news team's car was burned while hundreds of
people rampaged, breaking store windows and looting.
   Five arrests were reported in connection with the rioting and
Tamala Vergo, 17, was booked with second-degree murder. Official
police reports contain few details but individual officers, city
officials and one witness indicated McKinney was an innocent
bystander felled after a drug deal went sour.
   Wednesday night's violence was on a much smaller, less intense
scale.
   There were reports of sporadic gunfire and at least one fire.
But no injuries or arrests were reported as police let the
troublemakers disperse by themselves.
   Residents say Cedar Grove once was a quiet, racially mixed
suburb that has deteriorated for a variety of reasons. The area is
now predominantly black, the apparent result of ``white flight''
during the civil rights years.
   One police officer called the small area where most of the
violence occurred a ``curb-service crack store.''
   Buddy Chamness, a former resident who moved away five years ago,
said people of both races have left because of crime, particularly
the drug trade.
   ``At one time it was peaceful,'' said Chamness. ``When I was
young, children could walk up and down the streets without fear.
Our moms could walk to the store. I don't know what happened to the
neighborhood.''

<HEAD>Bush Will Spend $32 Million on Ads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush's plan to spend a
record amount on TV advertising continues a trend toward
presidential campaign budgets dominated by paid media expenditures,
political analysts said Thursday.
   Four years ago, Democratic nominee Walter Mondale spent more
than $20 million on media and President Reagan spent about $25
million.
   This fall, Vice President George Bush expects to mount a $32
million-plus TV blitz. That's at least 60 percent of the combined
$54 million that the candidate and his national party can spend
directly.
   A Bush aide, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said 60
percent, or $32.4 million, is ``a pretty accurate figure, which
would make it the largest television expenditure in modern
history.''
   Mark Gearan, a spokesman for Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis,
the Democratic nominee, said Dukakis would be competitive on the
airwaves but declined to be specific.
   Both candidates are relying on their parties to raise tens of
millions of dollars in unrestricted ``soft money'' for political
activities at the state and national levels, enabling them to
divert a greater percentage of their own limited campaign resources
to media.
   The soft money is available for party-building activities
including lawn signs, phone banks, generic TV ads, voter
registration and get-out-the-vote drives. Such expenditures do not
count toward the candidates' overall spending ceiling.
   Bay Buchanan, Reagan's campaign treasurer in both 1980 and 1984,
said the Reagan campaign forked over several million dollars for
get-out-the-vote activities four years ago.
   ``If you can get the party to raise it... that's $3 million to
$4 million dollars you'd obviously put to media time,'' she said.
``It's a very effective way to be running an organization. Usually
the states know better how to raise and spend the money.''
   The Bush game plan represents the increasingly critical role
played by TV advertising.
   ``The very first thing I did (in 1984) was take 50 percent of
the total amount we were allocated and put it to media,'' said
Buchanan. ``Then if any money could be picked up (from other
areas), we moved that money to media. That's where any loose money
went because we felt it was the most effective way to reach
voters.''
   Democrats and Republicans alike say they are not surprised by
this year's heavy tilt toward media spending, given the increasing
importance of TV ads and the high cost of buying air time,
particularly during widely watched events such as the Olympics and
the World Series.
   But they caution against treating it as a revolutionary
development.
   ``It's not a dramatic escalation of media dollars,'' said
Republican consultant John Buckley. ``It shouldn't be overstated.
It's just incrementally more than has been spent before, in real
terms and in percentage of the overall budget.''

<TEXT>
   The Federal Election Commission took a step
Thursday toward partial closing of a loophole that allows political
parties to pour millions of ``soft money'' dollars indirectly into
presidential election campaigns.
   The independent regulatory agency is under federal court order
to clarify its vague rules on soft money, which is banned in
federal elections but permitted in state and local contests.
   The commission unanimously agreed Wednesday to publish a notice
in the Federal Register seeking public comment on proposed rule
changes governing soft money.
   The new rules proposals include alternative methods of
allocating funds that benefit both federal and local election
activities. These include payment of administrative expenses and
financing of voter registration drives.
   The FEC changes also could result in substantial bookkeeping
requirements on state and local political organizations.
   Soft money includes union and corporate donations as well as
individual contributions that exceed the federal limit of $1,000
per candidate.
   National political parties are limited to spending $8 million
each toward electing a presidential candidate. But they accept
millions of dollars in soft money accounts which they give to state
and local affiliates fo Dukakis Courts Seniors

   The USS Vincennes, the Navy cruiser that
mistakenly shot down an Iranian airliner over the Persian Gulf,
rescued 26 Vietnamese refugees from a sinking fishing junk early
Thursday in the South China Sea, officials said.
   Dan Howard, the Defense Department spokesman, said the
guided-missile cruiser was steaming in heavy seas when a lookout
spotted a burning torch. After changing course, the Vincennes
``found a small, double-ended junk carrying 26 Vietnamese
refugees,'' the spokesman said.
   ``The commanding officer determined the vessel to be unseaworthy
and took all 26 people aboard,'' Howard said.
   Shortly after the 26 were rescued, ``the boat broke apart and
sank'' in heavy seas, he said.
   ``They were literally spotted in the nick of time,'' added Lt.
Cmdr. Craig Quigley, a Navy spokesman.
   ``They had been adrift for 15 days and were out of food, out of
water and subsisting on rain water. And as soon as they got on
board the Vincennes, their boat sank.''
   The Vincennes is transporting the refugees to its next port of
call, the Subic Bay Naval Base in the Philippines.
   According to Quigley, one of the refugees spoke some English and
told his rescuers the group had begun its voyage from the city of
Tra Vinh in the southern section of what used to be South Vietnam.
   The rescue was the second for the Vincennes in two months. Early
in August, the cruiser rescued five Iranian fishermen who had been
adrift in a small dinghy for more than a week after their boat sank.
   The Vincennes was operating at the time in the Gulf of Oman. A
month before, on July 3, the cruiser accidently shot down an
Iranian Air Bus, killing all 290 aboard, while steaming in the
nearby Persian Gulf.
   The rescue of Vietnamese refugees comes as the Navy is pursuing
a pre-trial investigation of the captain of the USS Dubuque for his
alleged dereliction of duty in failing to rescue another group of
Vietnamese refugees in early June.

<HEAD>Dukakis Calls Bush ``Fugitive From Truth''</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis struck back forcefully after
George Bush's visit to his home grounds Thursday, accusing his
Republican rival of being a ``fugitive from the truth'' in
portraying himself as a crimefighter and advocate of the
environment, education and elderly.
   ``We're here today to investigate a felony _ assault and battery
on the truth,'' the Democratic presidential nominee told a
boisterous rally outside the Massachusetts Statehouse shortly after
Bush came to Boston to pick up an endorsement from the leaders of a
Boston police union.
   ``What George Bush is doing to the truth in this campaign is a
crime,'' Dukakis said in his harshest attack yet on Bush. He spoke
to hundreds of cheering supporters and law enforcement officials
called in from around the nation to counter Bush's endorsement by
the police group.
   Dukakis also spent considerable time Thursday preparing for his
Sunday debate with Bush, meeting with New York Gov. Mario Cuomo to
discuss strategy and also attending a morning meeting with staff at
a Boston hotel where he is scheduled to take part in a mock debate
Friday.
   At the rally, recalling Bush's visit earlier this month to tour
polluted Boston Harbor, Dukakis said the vice president ``came here
to Boston to impersonate an environmentalist.'' He portrayed the
Reagan administration as an enemy of the Clean Water Act and
programs to clean up toxic waste.
   ``That's not the only time Mr. Bush has been a fugitive from the
truth,'' Dukakis said, ridiculing his rival's pledge to be the
education president and saying that when Bush has criticized the
Massachusetts economy, ``he's mugged the truth every time he's
opened his mouth.''
   Surrounded by police officers from several Massachusetts
departments as well as by law enforcement officials from Texas,
Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maine and two
nationwide police associations, representing more than 100,000
officers in all, Dukakis said of Bush: ``Now he's here in Boston
impersonating a law enforcement officer.
   ``We're here to give George Bush what Joe Friday used to ask
for: just the facts ma'am, just the facts,'' Dukakis said, invoking
the name of the fictional character in the popular ``Dragnet''
television series.
   ``His administration has waged not a war on crime but a war on
crime programs,'' Dukakis said.
   He then launched a scathing attack on Bush's crimefighting
record, saying drug task forces the vice president headed were
dismal failures.
   Dukakis also attacked Reagan administration ethical standards
and lashed back at Bush's frequent criticism of a Massachusetts
furlough program that, until amended earlier this year, allowed
weekend passes to first-degree murderers.
   ``For the past eight years George Bush has been running with a
crowd that wouldn't know the rule of law if it hit them in the
face,'' Dukakis said to rousing applause.
   As for furloughs, Dukakis said the federal government furloughed
nearly 16,000 inmates last year for up to 45 days at a time, among
them ``hundreds and hundreds of drug pushers and drug traffickers.''
   And he said the suspect in the murder of a Boston police officer
was a repeat violent offender who had been paroled from federal
prison after serving less than half of a prison term for bank
robbery.
   ``That's what's going on in the federal system these days, my
friends,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis had an energetic supporting cast for his rally,
including New York Gov. Cuomo and Ron DeLord, president of the
Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas, the largest police
organization in Bush's adopted home state.
   ``I'm tired of this pandering,'' Cuomo said of the Bush
campaign. ``I'm tired of the simplistics and the distortions by
people like the vice president.''
   DeLord, who gave Dukakis a 10-gallon hat after the rally, fired
up the crowd with an impassioned attack on Bush delivered in the
style of a preacher.
   ``I'm the only damn Texan in this town today representing police
officers, not George Bush,'' DeLord said. DeLord said he has been
president of the Texas organization for 12 years and, ``I've never
seen George Bush in person.''
   The rhetorical flogging of Bush by Dukakis and his supporters
overshadowed Dukakis' only planned event of the day _ a visit to a
Boston senior citizens center to reiterate his support for Social
Security while attacking Bush for breaking a tie in the Senate in
1985 with his vote to deny cost-of-living adjustments to Social
Security recipients.
   ``When election time rolls around, Mr. Bush says he wants to be
a great friend of older Americans,'' Dukakis said. ``Maybe he
thinks we all have amnesia.'' Dukakis also noted that Bush's
running mate, Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, was among the Republicans
voting to block the cost-of-living adjustments.
   ``Lloyd Bentsen and I have a very different view,'' Dukakis said
in touting his running mate, the Texas senator. ``We're going to
stop this attack on Social Security and Medicare and we'll stop it
cold.''

   Violence in St. Patrick's Cathedral that left an
usher and his deranged attacker dead was a ``special sacrilege and
tragedy,'' Cardinal John O'Connor said Thursday as he resanctified
the church and prayed for the assailant and victim alike.
   It was the first time in the 109-year history of the church that
the rite to purify a profaned sacred place was performed.
   The attack occurred about 8 p.m. Wednesday, an hour before the
church would close, when a man ran naked through the cathedral and
bludgeoned part-time usher John Winters, 77, to death with an iron
stanchion. He also injured a worshiper and a police officer before
being shot to death by police.
   The cardinal had seen the man, Jorge DelGado, 32, at morning
Mass that day when Delgado joined the line for communion.
   ``It was clear instantly there was something seriously wrong,''
O'Connor said. ``I looked up and there he is, standing before me, a
very big man, a very powerful looking man, bizarrely dressed.''
   ``He rolled his eyes. He opened and closed his eyes. He rolled
his head and the priest who was standing next to me whispered, `Be
careful. He gets violent,''' the cardinal said.
   DelGado, a vagrant who was born on St. Patrick's Day in 1956 had
pleaded guilty 11 times since 1982 to charges including assault,
attempted robbery and burglary. He had been in the cathedral many
times and had committed minor acts of vandalism there before.
   Many homeless people enter the church to avoid the heat or cold
or to find a place to sleep. Despite the attack, the archdiocese
will not change its open-door policy, O'Connor said. ``I would hate
to see us now get defensive.''
   O'Connor was not in the cathedral when DelGado, naked and
carrying red carnations and his sneakers, came into the church
Wednesday night. DelGado had stripped off his dirty shorts and
shirt minutes before in front of the RCA Building at Rockefeller
Plaza, a block away from the Fifth Avenue cathedral.
   When he first entered the church, DelGado hit a man sitting in a
back pew with the flowers and screamed, ``Get out! Get out!'' said
Chief of Detectives Robert Colangelo.
   He continued walking up the center aisle of the church to the
pew in which Linda Lawson, 39, was praying and repeatedly struck
her in the face, Colangelo said.
   The 6-foot-4, 250-pound DelGado then went to the altar of the
shrine of St. Elizabeth and pulled from the marble floor a bolted,
wrought-iron stanchion that held a prayer plaque.
   Officer James McMann, 50, who is assigned to the cathedral,
spotted DelGado and ordered him to put down the weapon. As DelGado
advanced on McMann, the officer radioed for help.
   DelGado attacked the officer, striking him in the head. He then
went to the main altar, where he found Winters, and struck him
seven or eight times in the head, killing him istantly, Colangelo
said.
   By then, three other officers arrived and repeatedly ordered
DelGado to stop. When DelGado started to lunge toward one, the
officer fired once, fatally striking DelGado in the chest, the
chief said.
   The entire incident was over in 10 minutes.
   Ms. Lawson was treated for facial injuries at the scene and
McMann was in stable condition Thursday at Bellevue Hospital.
   Before performing the resanctification rite, O'Connor spoke
about DelGado, saying he believed the attacker didn't ``have the
slightest idea what he was doing.''
   ``For it to have happened here is a special sacrilege and
tragedy,'' O'Connor said, adding that St. Patrick's was a ``magnet
for Catholics everywhere.''
   ``While the cathedral has been desecrated, while this
magnificent temple of almighty God, famous throughout the world,
has been violated, we must not forget that two men were killed here
last night,'' O'Connor told several hundred people attending the
first Mass of the day.
   ``It is for their souls I will be offering this Mass, as well as
for the purification of the cathedral.''

<HEAD>EPA Wants to Teach America to Recycle Garbage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Calling the garbage disposal problem ``on top
of us,'' the Environmental Protection Agency unveiled ambitious
draft plans Thursday to persuade Americans to recycle a quarter of
their garbage in four years.
   That would be 2{ times the proportion recycled today. In a
society that puts a premium on convenience and saving time and
energy, Americans generate 3.5 pounds of garbage and trash each day
for every man, woman and child.
   Places to put it are rapidly disappearing, as shown by the saga
of the garbage barge from Islip, N.Y. last year that couldn't
unload.
   Recylcing and the companion strategy of generating less garbage
in the first place _ ``source reduction'' _ enjoyed a vogue in the
early 1970s but lost steam in most places.
   For example, Reynolds Metals Co. claims to recycle more than 100
percent of its aluminum beverage cans because it accepts cans made
by others. It's much cheaper to buy an old can and melt it down for
new aluminum than to refine aluminum ore.
   J. Winston Porter, the agency's assistant administrator for
solid waste, said soaring costs of landfilling will bring recycling
back.
   ``Not only does it feel good, there are stark economic realities
out there'' to push recycling, Porter told a briefing for reporters
on the draft strategy put together by a special EPA task force
convened in February.
   In the 1970s, ``When people got energetic about recycling, they
quickly hit the hard economic realities. Landfilling was available
for $2 a ton. Now it's $50 or $100,'' Porter said.
   Though Las Vegas, Nev., has plenty of land nearby and pays $6 a
ton for landfilling, East Lyme, Conn., recently paid $100 a ton,
the agency said.
   From 18,000 in the 1970s and 9,000 in 1984, the number of
landfills has shrunk to about 6,000 and the agency believes a third
of those will close in the next five years.
   Today's landfills handle 80 percent of 160 million tons of
garbage and trash a year. The rest is equally split between
recycling and incineration.
   The load is growing, mostly because of paper.Wastepaper has
risen about 50 percent since 1960 to about 65 million tons a year _
paper for take-out dinners, paper for diapers, paper for computer
outputs, paper for hospital gowns.
   ``Twenty percent of that is recycled now. That could be roughly
doubled,'' said Porter.
   About 1 percent of plastics is recycled. ``We could get to 8 or
10 percent without much trouble.''
   The agency hopes to see recycling and reduced generation at 25
percent and incineration at 20 percent in 1992, leaving 55 percent
to be landfilled.
   Ten states already require recycling in some form or other, and
600 communities do it.
   These programs frequently require householders to separate
metals, plastics, glass, paper, leftover food and yard waste before
collection.
   The agency has given a $250,000 grant to the Environmental
Defense Fund for an advertising campaign in cooperation with the
Advertising Council to promote recycling.
   Asked about the usefulness of mandatory refundable deposits on
purchases of soft drinks, as some states require, Porter said he
would be reluctant to prescribe for every state, but ``I have seen
some good successes. Generally, I'm personally in favor of that...''
   ``What's going to be needed is an executive order by the
president, probably the next president, directing federal agencies
to purchase recycled goods,'' Porter said. ``That would jump-start
a lot of things.''
   An environmentalist was skeptical.
   ``It appears to me to be more of an exercise in public
relations,'' said Henry Cole of the Clean Water Action Project.
   ``We think new incinerators should not be permitted until a
community has met recycling goals,'' which should be set at about
50 percent of the waste stream, Cole said.

<HEAD>Democrats May Disavow Congressional Candidate For TWA Squabble</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HILLIARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional candidate being sued by TWA for
allegedly distributing posters accusing the airline of spreading
AIDS may be disavowed by his party, the state Democratic chairman
said Thursday.
   ``He was a realtor, an educator and seemed like a nice guy,''
state party Chairman Buie Seawell said of John J. Mitchell, 53, of
Colorado Springs.
   Mitchell was nominated without opposition in the heavily
Republican 5th District to run against freshman Rep. Joel Hefley,
the GOP candidate. The district encompasses the Colorado Springs
area south of Denver, and it never has sent a Democrat to Congress.
   Seawell compared Mitchell to a ``walk-on candidate'' and said
the party nominated him ``with the best of intentions.''
   ``But we were not tough-minded enough _ almost nobody is under
these circumstances _ and we've got to begin to get that way,'' he
said.
   Neither Democratic Party officials nor reporters have been able
to reach Mitchell for comment by telephone or in person since his
name surfaced in the lawsuit filed Monday by TWA.
   The Denver federal court suit accuses Mitchell of libeling the
airline and seeks $500,000 damages.
   Seawell said the 5th District Central Committee will meet Oct. 2
to consider the Mitchell case. The State Centays, read:
``AIDS is Spread Through TWA,'' ``Today's TWA Means AIDS'' and TWA:
Travel With AIDS.''
   TWA claims Mitchell sent a poster to the airline's New York
office on July 26 with a note that said: ``Thousands of these have
been sent around the country. Our staff is working on a new poster.
They will continue to be sent until TWA corrects the hurt you have
caused-cost me.''
   If Mitchell does not remove himself as a candidate, the party
may move to disavow itself from Mitchell, said Seawell.
   ``The Democratic Party does not, in any way, endorse or condone
alleged statements made by Mr. Mitchell regarding Trans World
Airlines,'' he said.
   Seawell said it may take a court action to actually remove
Mitchell's name from the ballot. ``We will do everything necessary
to provide a fair hearing before any action is taken by the 5th
District, the chairman or the central committee,'' he added.
   Mitchell, who has no previous political experience, has operated
J. Mitchell Realty in Colorado Springs since 1984, according to his
resume. He was a teacher in Massachusetts from 1962 to 1981 before
moving to Colorado. He once served as a waiter in the Air Force
Academy dining hall before receiving his real estate license.

   It's not as cheap as a string
around the finger, but a new gadget for the forgetful gives a
gentle nudge at the waistline as a reminder of whatever it is the
wearer wants to be reminded.
   A psychologist invented the vibrating gadget named the
MotivAider.
   The invention is based on what psychologist Steve Levinson of
Thief River Falls says is obvious _ that the human brain does a
poor job of making sure its owner does all the things that a person
has firmly resolved to do.
   The gadget he calls an ``intention arousing device,'' is about 2
inches square and hangs like a beeper from the user's belt.
   Set for intervals of one minute to 24 hours, it flutters
silently against the waistline.
   The wearer has programmed in his or her memory what the reminder
means, says Levinson.
   Ros Fairbank, who lost to Martina Navratilova in the Wimbledon
quarterfinals this year, told the Star Tribune of Minneapolis that
it helped improve her backhand. Her problem was failing to get her
racquet back early enough and to ``hit over the ball,'' she said in
a phone interview.
   She set the MotivAider at three-minute intervals and wore it
during practice. When it vibrated, she said to herself ``Early
preparation!'' and that's what she focused on.
   ``I wouldn't say it made me win a match,'' she said, ``but it
developed my backhand and my confidence in my backhand.''
   Bill Priedeman, a Deephaven sales manager, says he improved his
golf game. When the $79.95 battery-operated device fluttered at
three-minute intervals he told himself: ``Keep your head down, slow
on the backswing and stop before you come down again.'' The result:
``I shot 10 strokes less than I ever had before.''

   The battle over which Brunswick holds
title to the original Brunswick stew moves on as a losing team from
Georgia heads for Virginia in November for a rematch.
   Woody Woodside, executive director of the Brunswick-Golden Isles
Chamber of Commerce, said the Georgia residents weren't surprised
they came up on the short end of last week's contest, held in
Brunswick County, Va.
   ``How could we win on their turf?'' he said.
   The Virginians will defend their title during Brunswick's Main
Street Jubilee on Nov. 19.
   Phyllis Taunton, head of the Georgia cooking team, said when
Brunswick County, Va., announced plans to hold a stew cook-off
during its Heritage Festival, ``we felt we had to be there to
defend our honor.''
   The debate over which of the two communities can rightfully
claim the original Brunswick stew recipe began when the Georgia
town challenged other Brunswicks in the nation to a cook-off, said
Woodside.
   The Virginia county accepted the challenge, but was unable to
attend last year's cook-off in Georgia, he said.
   ``They even went so far as to approach their Commonwealth to get
a resolution claiming they had the original Brunswick Stew,''
Woodside said. So, in the spirit of competition, the Brunswick
legislative delegation approached the Georgia General Assembly and
received a similar resolution.
   Chef Dan Dickerson said Virginia's version of Brunswick stew
uses a chicken base instead of the pork or beef used by the
Georgians and is not as spicy as the Georgia version.

<TEXT>
   Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling
says former U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle knowingly used false
testimony in a criminal probe involving allegations that Pindling
had accepted bribes from drug traffickers.
   Justice Department spokesman Loye Miller declined comment
Thursday on Pindling's accusations, contained in a letter the
Bahamian government said was delivered to U.S. Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh. It calls for appointment of a special prosecutor
to investigate Merkle, the former U.S. attorney in Tampa, Fla., for
prosecutorial misconduct.
   A three-page statement describing the letter was made available
to the news media by the Bahamian embassy in Washington.
   The letter by an attorney for Pindling, Ira Dement, says Merkle
``used perjured evidence, knowing it to be false or not caring
whether it was true or untrue, seeming for political gain.'' Merkle
was defeated in a Florida primary election earlier this month in a
bid for a U.S. Senate seat.
   Convicted drug smuggler George William Baron testified under
questioning by Merkle earlier this year at the trial of Colombian
drug dealer Carlos Lehder that in 1980, he paid Pindling $400,000
in cash in a Paradise Island casino in the presence of Lady
Pindling, Tourism Minister Clement Maynard, Mrs. Maynard and many
others. Merkle opened a grand jury probe of Pindling.
   Dement said testimony by Baron and Gorman Bannister alleging
official complicity in drug smuggling was easily refutable, but
that Merkle made no effort to check out their stories. In May 1988,
Merkle was advised by Pindling's personal attorney, F. Lee Bailey,
that Bannister and Baron were lying, said Dement.
   Bailey offered Merkle the full cooperation of the prime
minister, said Dement, who added that Bailey is prepared to testify
that Merkle ``promised an expeditious conclusion'' of his probe.
Merkle used Baron's groundless recitation again, only a month
later, in the trial of Robert Castoro without making an effort to
verify his testimony, said Dement.
   The statement made available to the news media said Dement sent
Thornburgh documentation showing that the Pindlings were in Africa
when the payoff allegedly was made. Dement said the prime minister
and Deputy Prime Minister Clement Maynard have indicated they are
willing to cooperate in an investigation of the allegations of
Banister and Baron and the lack of effort by Merkle to review the
evidence of that falsity.
   In an interview in Thursday editions of the New York Times,
Merkle was quoted as saying that ``Sir Lynden is full of hot air''
and that his investigation was handled in accord with Justice
Department rules.

   A House committee on Thursday approved a
$550,000 budget increase for the ethics committee to cover mounting
costs of an investigation into allegations of financial
improprieties by House Speaker Jim Wright.
   The chairman of the ethics panel, Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif.,
said the outside counsel hired to conduct the investigation has
been costing $150,000 a month and by the end of this month would
exhaust the $300,000 earlier earmarked for the probe.
   ``It's taking a lot of time,'' said Rep. John T. Myers, R-Ind.,
the senior minority member of the ethics committee, formally known
as the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct. ``It takes a lot
more in-depth investigation than we ever anticipated.''
   But he added: ``We have a commitment to the Congress'' to be
thorough. ``This is necessary. I don't think we have any choice.''
   The counsel, Chicago attorney Richard J. Phelan, has assigned
six or seven attorneys to work on the case, which involves
allegations that Wright, D-Texas, abused his congressional office
for personal gain and improperly intervened with federal regulators
on behalf of constituents.
   The attorneys together are spending an average of 1,200 to 1,300
hours monthly on the probe, Dixon said.
   Dixon told the Committee on House Administration, the chamber's
housekeeping panel, that the $550,000 funding boost would enable
the probe to extend through the end of the year, if needed. It also
is possible the investigation could extend into 1989, Dixon said.
   Wright, who appeared before the panel for more than five hours
last week to present his defense, has said repeatedly that he wants
the investigation completed before Congress adjourns for the year
in mid-October.
   Dixon declined to comment on why the probe was taking longer
than expected.
   On a separate matter relating to the speaker, Dixon told
reporters that a new request from the House Republican leadership
for an ethics probe of Wright, concerning his disclosure of a
purported CIA covert action in Nicaragua, would be dealt with
separately from the current probe.
   ``That would be done independent of this,'' he said. ``I think
it would be done in a whole different manner,'' perhaps with the
cooperation of the Intelligence Committee, he added.

   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan
Quayle said Thursday that perestroika in the Soviet Union has yet
to live up to its promise, and he cautioned against making
unilateral concessions to the Soviets at the arms table.
   The Indiana senator wrapped up a four-day swing across the West
with what aides billed as a major foreign policy address, and he
used a TelePrompTer for the first time since his convention
acceptance speech.
   In a foreign policy speech earlier this month in Chicago, Quayle
discarded his text and gave a rambling, discursive address.
   Addressing 1,300 people at a Los Angeles World Affairs Council
luncheon, Quayle made no mention of Michael Dukakis, the Democratic
presidential candidate. But he criticized several Dukakis foreign
policy and defense stances.
   Quayle said Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev recognizes that
``without major changes, the Soviet Union could well enter the next
century ... (like) a Third World nation.''
   Of perestroika, or restructuring, he said, ``Like the book of
the same name, actual content has so far not lived up to the
advance press notices.''
   Americans should judge the Soviets' actions by whether they pull
back from ``global `pot stirring''' in Afghanistan, Angola,
Nicaragua and other places, he said.
   He called the Soviet radar station at Krasnoyarsk a blatant
violation of the ABM Treaty and it should be dismantled
immediately, not turned into an international space tracking
station as Gorbachev recently suggested.
   He also urged the Soviets to demonstrate their seriousness on
arms control by reducing their long-range SS-18 missiles and their
new, mobile SS-24s and SS-25s.
   And Gorbachev should ``show his good faih by renouncing the
Brezhnev Doctrine unequivocally'' and agreeing to a pullback of
Soviet troops from Eastern Europe, he said. Because of the current
imbalance of Soviet and NATO forces, the Soviets must pull back
more troops, Quayle said.
   He also called for the Soviets to allow freedom to emigrate
``for Jews and refuseniks and anyone else.''
   ``One does not deal with the Soviet Union by unilaterally
removing negotiating leverage before the negotiations even begin,''
he said, in what appeared to be a reference to Dukakis' opposition
to the mobile MX and Midgetman missiles.
   Turning to Star Wars, he said the proposed space-based missile
defense system ``is not a `fantasy' or a `fraud' or a `gizmo' as
some have called it.''
   ``It is the margin of survival for American citizens if a
nuclear missile, whether by design or accident, is ever launched
against our land,'' he said.
   He urged a return to bipartisanship in foreign policy, saying,
``Congress serves the nation best when it allows the president
maximum freedom in foreign policy decision-making.''
   Quayle, who says the War Powers Act should be curtailed or
drastically rewritten, said cited Nicaragua as an example of a
confused foreign policy. Congress has no business ``drawing silly
distinctions between lethal and non-lethal aid to a guerrilla
army.''
   Quayle fielded 13 questions from the audience, strongly
defending Contra aid with a declaration that ``the Monroe Doctrine
is alive and well in America.''
   ``There is something in this country that is called the Monroe
Doctrine ... (that) says foreign powers coming into our hemisphere
... is against the national interest of this country,'' Quayle said.
   Quayle said he voted for sanctions against South Africa ``to
send a message that we must begin to work and to see what a
post-apartheid government will look like.'' But he said he does not
support additional sanctions now.
   Meanwhile, in Washington, Quayle's campaign said that Sen. Bob
Packwood, R-Ore., will play Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as Quayle prepares
for the Oct. 5 debate with his Democratic counterpart.
   Packwood preceded Bentsen as chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, serves on the panel with Bentsen and is considered a top
debater in the Senate.

<HEAD>Airlines Told To Equip Aircraft With Devices To Detect Wind Shear</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration on
Thursday ordered airlines to equip all their aircraft with devices
that will help pilots detect and escape from deadly wind shears.
   Powerful shears called microbursts have been called the No. 1
killer of airline passengers and have been responsible for at least
five fatal airline crashes and 500 deaths in the last decade,
according to aviation safety experts.
   The FAA regulation was announced by the Transportation
Department, which said the devices, to be phased into operation in
all aircraft of 30 or more seats over the next four years, will
cost $40,000 to $50,000 per airplane.
   About 3,600 commercial jet transport planes also will be
required to have the devices, department officials said.
   A microburst is a powerful downburst of air caused by a sudden
change in wind direction. Such a downburst struck a Delta Air Lines
L-1011 as it was attempting to land at Dallas-Fort Worth in 1985
and literally forced the plane into the ground, killing 134 people.
   The accident focused increased attention on developing and
installing sophisticated ground radar that would provide advanced
warning of shears along departure and approach lanes, but the radar
is not expected to be available until the early 1990s.
   At the same time, the FAA and industry began taking a closer
look at devices for the cockpit that would provide pilots with a
clear indication when their plane is facing wind shear conditions.
   Piedmont Airlines two years ago began installing the equipment
being required by the FAA and today has the devices in 112 of its
191 aircraft, according to Piedmont spokesman Mike Clark.
   It could not immediately be determined whether other airlines
have bought similar equipment.
   Under the FAA regulation the airlines will be allowed to phase
in installation of the equipment over about four years. Half of an
airline's fleet must have the devices within 27 months,
three-fourths of the fleet within 39 months and the rest of the
fleet within 51 months.
   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said the equipment ``will
enhance safety by giving pilots a valuable tool for coping with the
dangerous wind shear phenomenon.''
   ``Experience has shown that pilots can recover successfully from
wind shear encounters if they can recognize the situation quickly
enough and have sufficient information to execute escape
maneuvers,'' Burnley said in a statement.
   But the aviation industry has been divided on the value of the
cockpit devices. Some experts note that the equipment is not a
radar that would give advance warning of a shear.
   Instead, the system consists of sensitive equipment that
calculates airspeed and other factors and tells a pilot when the
plane is in the midst of wind shear conditions. Critics of the
equipment have suggested that by then it may already be too late to
fly through a microburst, especially if the plane is close to the
ground, as in a takeoff or landing.
   The FAA rule also requires airlines to provide pilots with
increased training on wind shear recognition and recovery
procedures while using the new equipment.
   Pilots are divided as to how best to fly through a shear. Many
insist that a powerful microburst such as the one that struck the
Delta plane in Dallas or the one encountered by a Pan American
World Airways jetliner that crashed as it was taking off from New
Orleans in 1982 is virtually impossible to escape. The Pan Am crash
left 154 people dead.
   The airlines as well as the pilots union have urged speedy
development and installation of so-called Doppler radar at major
airports so that shears can be detected in advance and pilots can
maneuver around them or not depart. The first of 17 such Doppler
radars are scheduled to be installed at airports between 1990 and
1992. About 30 additional radars would be installed at other
airports later under an FAA contract scheduled to be awarded later
this year.
   The FAA and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
also have under way a five-year research program aimed at
eventually developing a more advanced wind shear detection device
for the cockpit that would be able to warn a pilot in advance when
it is about to encounter shear conditions.

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Sanctions Over Use Of Poison Gas Against
Kurds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brushing aside Reagan administration
objections, the House Foreign Affairs Committee approved on
Thursday legislation imposing sanctions on Iraq for its alleged use
of poison gas ``against Kurdish insurgents and unarmed Kurdish
civilians.''
   The committee acted after senior Republican members told
administration officials that there is strong bipartisan support
for the measure in the House and urged them to reconsider their
opposition.
   One official, Peter Burley, deputy assistant secretary of state
for Middle Eastern Affairs, told the panel the Reagan
administration believes the sanctions legislation is `'premature''
and ``counterproductive'' because it is likely to undercut intense
diplomatic efforts aimed at preventing the future use of chemical
weapons by Iraq.
   ``I am very disappointed in the statement that you read,'' said
Rep. William S. Broomfield, R-Mich., the panel's senior GOP member.
``A lot of effort has gone into making this a bipartisan effort. I
think this is a very measured response and I think the
administration will see when it hits the floor the large bipartisan
support it will have.''
   Unlike sanctions legislation approved earlier by the Senate, the
House resolution does not accuse Iraq of waging a war of genocide
against the country's Kurdish minority. And the sanctions it would
impose, at least initially, are generally less severe.
   The resolution declares that the Iraqi army has destroyed
Kurdish villages in northern Iraq and adds: ``Substantial evidence
exists that the Iraqi army has been using chemical weapons against
Kurdish insurgents and unarmed Kurdish civilians.''
   It calls that ``a gross violation of international law.''
   In a series of initial steps, the resolution would prohibit
government-to-government or commercial arms sales to Iraq as well
as sensitive high technology items.
   It authorizes the president, after consultation with Congress,
to take a series of other punitive actions against Iraq including
barring Iraqi exports, including petroleum products, from entering
the United States, barring or restricting U.S. exports to Iraq,
denying U.S. financial credits or financial guarantees and opposing
loans to Iraq by international financial institutions.
   The resolution authorizes the president to waive any or all of
the sanctions if he certifies to Congress that Iraq is not using
chemical weapons in violation of international law, that Iraq has
provided ``reliable assurances'' that it will not use chemical
weapons in the future and that it is willing to permit on-site
inspection by impartial observers.
   The committee approved the measure on a voice vote after acting
to include a prohibition against the export to Iraq of any chemical
that might be used to produce chemical weapons and to authorize the
president to bar the sale of an entire steel plant in Texas to Iraq.
   The House committee's action follows the issuance on Wednesday
of a Senate staff report based on interviews with more than 200 of
the 65,000 Kurdish refugees who fled into Turkey following the
alleged poison gas attacks on their villages by Iraqi aircraft.
   The report concludes that ``overwhelming evidence exists'' that
Iraq used chemical weapons against the Kurds and that hundreds,
perhaps thousands, of people likely were killed.
   The only committee member to oppose the House resolution was
Rep. Toby Roth, R-Wis., who said that while the use of poison gas
is ``despicable,'' sanctions against Iraq will only hurt U.S.
exporters.
   But Rep. James Bilbray, D-Nev., said that to do nothing is
unacceptable.
   ``If we don't do something we are going to have tell our own
children and grandchildren that we sat by while an entire people
was exterminated,'' he said.
   Burley said the State Department is encouraged by a recent
statement by the foreign minister of Iraq which he said U.S.
diplomats interpret as meaning that ``there will be no future use
of chemical weapons.''
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., told Burley: ``I am intrigued by your
logic which looks at a criminal act, sweeps it aside and takes the
word of a criminal that he will not take criminal actions in the
future.''
   Burley replied: ``We believe enacting these sanctions now will
lessen our influence ... We do not believe that sanctions now would
bring us closer to the objective we both share, ending the use of
chemical weapons by Iraq.''

<HEAD>Judge Sets Hearing on Whether Former CIA Agent Can Be Indicted
Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Thursday granted a defense
request for a hearing on whether Iran-Contra prosecutors could
re-indict former CIA agent Joseph F. Fernandez in Virginia if
charges filed here were dismissed.
   U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. scheduled an Oct. 6
hearing on a motion by independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh to
dismiss five criminal charges against Fernandez so that prosecutors
could seek a new indictment from a federal grand jury in nearby
Alexandria, Va.
   Lawyers for Fernandez, who is charged with helping direct a
secret arms supply network for the Nicaraguan rebels in defiance of
a congressional ban on such aid, urged the judge to dismiss the
case altogether rather than give prosecutors a chance to bring
fresh charges.
   The dispute stems from Fernandez's refusal to waive his right to
be tried in the Eastern District of Virginia on charges that he
lied about his role in the arms-supply network to his CIA superiors
and to the presidential commission headed by former Sen. John
Tower, R-Texas, that investigated the Iran-Contra affair.
   Four counts of the indictment alleging Fernandez obstructed the
commission's work and made false statements charge the alleged
offenses occurred at CIA headquarters in Langley, Va.
   The conspiracy charge, which is the fifth count of the
indictment, alleges that Fernandez, former National Security
Council aide Oliver North and arms dealer Richard V. Secord,
operated an illegal arms supply network. Part of the conspiracy
occurred in Washington, according to the indictment.
   Last week, Fernandez moved to dismiss the four other charges
because the federal court in Washington lacked jurisdiction over
them.
   Rather than face the prospect of two trials, Walsh asked
Robinson for permission to dismiss all five charges against
Fernandez so that he could seek a new indictment from a federal
grand jury in Alexandria.
   Defense attorney Thomas E. Wilson argued in court papers earlier
this week that prosecutors should not be allowed to bring the case
in Virginia because they already have been given a preview of
Fernandez's defense in motions filed before Robinson.

   Seven days before the U.S. hopes to return to
manned space flight, President Reagan lauded the ``seven heroes''
of the Challenger on Thursday and pledged, ``You can delay our long
trek to greatness, but you cannot halt it.''
   Returning to the scene of one of his most emotional times as
president, Reagan told workers at the Johnson Space Center:
   ``Soon the world will be watching as five brave Americans lift
off from Earth. America is going to space again _ and we are going
there to stay.''
   Three days after the Challenger blew apart on Jan. 28, 1986,
little more than a minute after liftoff, Reagan went to the Johnson
Space Center to console the relatives and friends of the seven crew
members who died.
   America's worst space tragedy shook the nation and threw the
space program into disarray.
   In a speech to NASA employees a week before Discovery's
blast-off, Reagan said, ``Our early settlers knew great risks and
made great sacrifices, but with their sacrifices, they moved the
frontier forward and built a great nation.''
   ``Neither can we stand still, nor be content, and we are not
afraid,'' Reagan said. ``Ill fortune can slow us down, but it
cannot stop us.''
   Upon his arrival in Houston, Reagan was asked if he wanted to go
up in space. ``I've been there for several years,'' the president
chuckled as he climbed into his limousine.
   At the sprawling space center, Reagan greeted the five Discovery
crewmen: commander Frederick Hauck, co-pilot Richard Covey and
mission specialists John Lounge, George ``Pinky'' Nelson and David
Hilmers.
   The president was treated to a brief tour of a mockup of a space
shuttle. The crew, clad in royal blue jumpsuits, led Reagan up the
stairs to peer through an open hatch in the two-story-high mockup
of the shuttle.
   Reagan, queried after his brief tour whether he wished he
committed more money to the space program, replied, ``I've tried to
do all that's possible. We've had some problems,'' he added,
apparently referring to the Challenger tragedy.
   ``This program is the highest priority,'' Reagan said.
   The president then walked toward the end of the mock shuttle,
where he addressed 8,000 to 10,000 NASA employees, contractors and
their families, many of whom waved tiny American flags under the
bright Texas sun and roared their approval during Reagan's speech.
   At the end of his speech, Hauck presented Reagan with a royal
blue jacket and told him that the insignia patch from the Discovery
mission would be flown into space with the shuttle crew and
returned and presented to Reagan at the end of the mission.
   Before meeting the astronauts, who are under a modified
quarantine before their scheduled launch, Reagan underwent a
medical examination in which he was pronounced free of any disease
that could be easily transmitted.
   Reagan's senior aides and Secret Service detail were required to
complete medical data forms before they were cleared to enter the
space center with the president. Only Reagan was to have direct
contact with the astronauts.
   Next Thursday, the shuttle is scheduled to blast off from Cape
Canaveral, Fla., on a four-day stay in orbit _ a mission that will
include the launching of a $100 million communications satellite.
   The flight will be the first in 32 months _ a wrenching period
in which NASA underwent a series of management and other changes,
including a redesign of the shuttle boosters, emanating from a
presidential commission's findings resulting from the accident.
   The tragedy was a monumental setback to the space program, which
was the first to put a man on the moon and which had led the world
in exploration after initially playing catchup with the Soviet
Union in the late 1960s.
   Reagan's space-center stop came on a day in which the president
was making campaign appearances in Texas for Republican
presidential candidate George Bush and Rep. Beau Boulter, R-Texas,
who is trying to wrest Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's seat from him. Bentsen
is running for both the Senate and the vice presidency under a
Texas law that permits such a dual candidacy.
   The president was wrapping up his campaign day by sharing the
stage with Bush at a $1,000-a-plate fund-raising dinner for some
2,500 Republicans.
   In the Johnson Space Center pep talk, Reagan said that ``when we
launch the space shuttle Discovery, even more than the thrust of
Discovery's great engines, it will be the inspiring courage of our
heroes, and the hopes and dreams of every American, that will lift
the shuttle into the heavens. And may the hand of God bring it
safely back to Earth.''
   ``And when the Discovery takes off, seven precious souls will
soar beside it, the seven heroes of the Challenger,'' he added.
``With their lives, they moved a nation, they summoned America to
reach higher still, as they wrote man's destiny into the stars.''
   Reagan recalled how he had joined Americans in mourning the loss
of the Challenger crew members ``one cold January day'' in 1986,
and said:
   ``We are a nation born of pioneers, and we will always create
our future on the frontier. America can live no other way.''

<HEAD>House Panels Approve Banking Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two House committees approved legislation
Thursday that grants banks broad new powers to affiliate through
holding companies with securities firms.
   The House Energy and Commerce and Judiciary committees, racing a
deadline, approved amendments to a bill passed by the House Banking
Committee last month. The Senate also has completed work on a
separate measure.
   The Energy and Commerce Committee, under Chairman John D.
Dingell, D-Mich., hastily approved amendments drafted by the panel
late Wednesday night and early Thursday morning.
   One amendment, which was being reproduced for members, arrived
at the committee at 11:55 a.m. and was approved at 12:01 p.m.
   Nevertheless, Dingell said in a statement after 23 committee
members voted to send the measure to the floor, with only Rep.
Ralph M. Hall, D-Tex., asking that he be recorded against the bill:
``The committee today restored balance and equity to the
restructuring of the financial services industry.
   ``The real winners today were the nation's depositors, investors
and taxpayers,'' he said. ``If everyone with an interest in this
legislation, both inside and outside the Congress, can come
together in a spirit of harmony and compromise, it will be possible
to work out a bill.''
   Treasury Undersecretary George D. Gould issued a statement
expressing ``strong opposition'' to the Energy and Commerce
Committee's action.
   It ``demonstrates that the House of Representatives is not
prepared to move forward into the modern financial world ... (and
is) retreating into a protectionist, anti-competitive regime left
over from the 1930s,'' he said.
   The administration favors the bank-securities bill passed by the
Senate because it permits banks to enter into a greater number of
securities activities.
   Donald G. Ogilvie, executive vice president of the American
Bankers Association, said, however, his organization is extremely
disappointed by the action taken by the Dingell committee.
   ``At a time when positive legislation is badly needed to
modernize the banking laws so bankers can fully meet their
customers' needs, the committee's action removes the only positive
feature contained in the House bill _ new securities authorities,''
he said. ``Their action also makes the limited bank insurance
authorities even more restrictive. If passed, the bill would be a
dramatic step backwards for American consumers and U.S. banking.''
   The Judiciary Committee also approved the measure after removing
mandatory prison sentences for individuals who breach the so-called
``firewalls'' constructed between banking and securities functions,
an amendment introduced by Rep. William J. Hughes, D-N.J.
   The full House is expected to take up the measure next week.
   In his opening statement, Dingell said any relaxation of the
Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, designed to preclude virtually
all securities activities by banks and their affiliates, ``must
carry with it the creation of strong firewalls, functional
regulation, and effective prohibitions against conflicts of
interest in order to repeat the abuses which necessitated the
creation of the Glass-Steagall wall.'' He said he believes his
amendments do that.
   Among other things, the amendments would:
   _Prohibit loans between banks and their securities affiliates to
prop up a failing affiliate or purchase securities underwritten by
the affiliate.
   _Strictly limit transfer of confidential customer information
between banks and securities affiliates.
   _Prohibit illegal tie-ins so that all dealings are arms-length.
   _Prohibit a bank from stuffing its trust department accounts
with unsound securities underwritten by its securities affiliate.
   _Prohibit shared name, premises, log and advertising.
   _Prohibit shared officers, directors and employees, with
rulemaking authority to make exceptions for smaller banks.

   The government expects to sell about 2,500
single-family homes within the next couple of days, following a
federal judge's decision lifting a three-week ban on such sales,
federal housing officials said Thursday.
   More than 27,000 homes owned by HUD went back on the market
Thursday morning after U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch refused to
issue a preliminary injunction in a suit by homeless advocates who
say more of the government-owned houses should be made available to
people living in the streets.
   Government lawyers argued that stopping the sales would bankrupt
the Federal Housing Administration's home mortgage insurance fund.
All of the houses were obtained after buyers defaulted on
FHA-backed loans.
   HUD had more than 47,000 such houses when Gasch issued a
temporary restraining order Aug. 30, but about 20,000 of them were
not affected because contracts already had been signed for their
sale.
   Jim Nistler, HUD deputy assistant secretary, said field offices
around the country to expect about 2,500 sales contracts to be
signed right away for the houses that were off the market since
Gasch issued the order in a suit by the National Housing Law
Project.
   Project lawyer Florence Roisman said Thursday that homeless
advocates were ``deeply disappointed'' with the oon's
resources.''
   Ruder also said it would be difficult to determine who was
responsible for ``deficiencies'' in the bond's disclosure reports.
He noted, too, that bondholders were already trying to recover
their investments through a civil trial in Tucson, Ariz.
   In a 376-page report that brought to a close what had been
described as the largest single investigation in SEC history, the
commission's staff found that WPPSS tried to put the best spin
possible on the construction and financial problems that led up to
the default in 1983 and in some cases ``avoided disclosure of
negative developments.''
   Others, including the bond underwriters, bond counsel and the
rating agencies, weren't agressive enough in asking questions and
exercising ``due diligence'' to ensure that investors were aware of
the supply system's mounting problems, the report said.
   The report, however, drew no legal conclusions.
   While taking no enforcement action, the commission decided to
seek public comment on a proposed rule that would impose stricter
disclosure requirements on issuers of municipal bonds and the
securities firms that sell them.
   The SEC's decision drew criticism from some members of Congress.
   ``It sends a message that if you mess up, mess up big because
the principal regulatory agency doesn't have the resources to
pursue enforcement action,'' said Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.
   Wyden said the report ``dances around the key issues'' and he
would ask Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy
and Commerce Committee, to hold a hearing on the SEC's decision to
drop the WPPSS case.
   Dingell, who had previously said it would be a ``outrage'' if
the SEC failed to act against those responsible for the default,
said in a statement that his committee would look at the SEC's
decision ``at the earliest possible time.
   ``The decision to terminate the SEC's WPPSS investigation
without enforcement is not well received by the WPPSS bondholders
or by me,'' Dingell said.
   The report concluded that the default resulted from extensive
cost overruns and construction delays at WPPSS Project No. 4 at the
Hanford nuclear reservation in southeastern Washington state and
No. 5 at Satsop, west of Olympia, Wash.
   Cost of the projects had soared from an initial estimate of
slightly over $2 billion to almost $12 billion before construction
was halted in 1981.
   Both projects were abandoned in January 1982 and in 1983 WPPSS
quit making payments on the bonds after the Washington state
Supreme Court held that the utilities' contracts with the
consortium were illegal and thus unenforceable. Without payments
from the 88 participating utilities, many in other states, WPPSS
defaulted.
   As early as 1978, the report said WPPSS recognized it could face
long-term financing problems.
   Top supply system officials told the 88 utilities participating
in the projects in late 1980 that WPPSS' ``cash flow coverage was
so low that there was almost none at times,'' the report said.
   They warned that the projects might be terminated as a result of
the cash flow situation.
   The report said the participants, also in late 1980, asked the
supply system to study the possibility of slowing down construction
or terminating the two projects.
   The request was kept confidential because of its possible impact
on the financial markets and WPPSS continued to sell bonds, more
than $400 million worth, before the projects were eventually
scrubbed, the report said.
   The report found that WPPSS also failed to adquately disclose in
the official bond statements that forecasts showed a drop in the
demand for electricity in the Northwest.

   Small-town youths awed by easy money were used to
build a major big-city drug empire in what a federal prosecutor
Thursday called ``A Tale of Two Cities'' _ rural Marianna, Ark.,
and cocaine-infested Detroit.
   Cocaine, processed in ``cook-up houses'' by 14-year-old girls
into crack, its smokeable form, was sold by boys, many under 16, in
crack houses run by the Chambers ring, which once accounted for
half of Detroit's crack trade, prosecutors charge.
   Four Chambers brothers _ Billy Joe, Larry Marlowe, Otis Bernard
and Willie Lee _ and 10 other people are on trial on federal
charges including cocaine conspiracy, firearms and tax evasion
counts.
   U.S. Attorney Roy Hayes said in opening arguments that Billy Joe
and Larry Chambers came from Marianna in 1982 and built their
empire on three secrets of success: recruiting, organization and
discipline.
   Hayes' first witness, former organization member Patricia
Middleton, backed his descriptions of an expanding network of
trusted lieutenants and child drug dealers, kept in line by a
no-holds-barred ``wrecking crew or beat-up crew.''
   Fourteen defendants, their attorneys, prosecutors and reporters
outnumbered spectators in a small federal courtroom for the opening
day of an expected six-week trial. Jury selection took four days.
   People passed through a metal detector to enter, and U.S.
marshals sat at both ends of the hallway in Detroit's federal
building.
   William Coonce, agent in charge of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration's Detroit office, had pledged tight security to
avoid any possible reprisals against more than 50 government
witnesses.
   Forty-one cars, including Mercedes-Benz, Cadillac and Jeep
models; 250 weapons; $500,000 in cash and $500,000 in jewelry were
seized in serving 107 search warrants that led to federal
indictments, Coonce said earlier.
   Authorities described a drug ring that had as many as 400
employees, operated up to 300 crack houses and, at its peak in
1987, sold up to $3 million worth of cocaine a day.
   That ended with the indictments of 22 people in March. Four
entered guilty pleas earlier and four remain fugitives.
   Defense attorneys, in their opening arguments, attacked Hayes'
case and ``Tale of Two Cities'' analogy, saying he is relying on
shaky witnesses, many of whom are testifying to avoid prosecution
for their own offenses.
   David Harris, attorney for defendant Morris Hampton, told jurors
that by the time the trial is finished, ``You will be reading a
different book: `Much Ado About Nothing.'''
   Middleton, who was to take the stand again Friday, said she made
money pickups for the organization for about six months under
threats from Larry Chambers that the man she lived with would be
hurt.
   She said she saw crack cocaine made and sold, saw organization
members get paid up to $800 a week and saw people beaten who
crossed the Chambers brothers. ``I got pulled into it. That's not
me,'' said Middleton, who finally went to police and who testified
in return for immunity from prosecution.
   She pointed out Eric Lamar Wilkins in the courtroom, identifying
him as a ``wrecking crew'' member she knew as Fats. She said she
once saw him carry a body out of an apartment building where the
organization sold crack and put it in a garbage bin in a field
across the street.

   A new survey released Thursday indicates that as
many as 700,000 young American men may have at least 10 sex
partners a year, putting them at ``considerable risk'' of sexually
transmitted diseases including AIDS.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported that a survey
of U.S. sexual habits shows that ``most Americans appear to be at
relatively low risk of infection'' with the virus that causes AIDS,
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   ``However, a sizeable percentage of young, never-married men
report more than 10 partners in the past 12 months,'' including 5
percent of those 18-29.
   The survey interviewed 1,481 people, asking them to write
privately and submit anonymously their answers to four questions
about their sexual habits.
   Three percent of the men interviewed reported five to 10 sex
partners in the previous year. One in 100 reported more than 10 _
including 3 percent of the men between 18 and 29, 1 percent of the
men 30-44 and 2 percent of the men 45-60.
   ``This is something that concerns us,'' said Dr. William Darrow,
a CDC AIDS specialist. ``You're talking about millions of people
... and we don't know whether they're taking other kinds of
precautions,'' such as discussing AIDS testing with partners and
using condoms.
   Applied to the U.S. population, the survey indicates more than
700,000 single men aged 18-29 and more than 100,000 aged 30-44 may
have 10 or more partners a year, leaving them ``at considerable
risk'' of AIDS, the CDC said.
   AIDS is spread chiefly through sexual contact or the sharing of
drug needles; persons with multiple sex partners are considered at
increased risk for the deadly disease. More than 70,000 U.S. cases
have been reported, and federal health officials believe as many as
1.5 million Americans are infected with the virus that can cause
AIDS.
   Overall, 22 percent of the respondents said they had had no sex
partners in the previous year, and 60 percent reported only one
partner. Eleven percent said two to four, 2 percent said five or
more, and 6 percent did not answer the question.
   ``At least 80 percent seem to be at relatively low risk of
infection'' from sex, Darrow said.
   People also were asked about the status of their sex partners _
their gender and whether they were spouses, friends, pick-ups or
prostitutes.
   Six percent of the men and 1 percent of the women surveyed said
at least one of their sex partners in the previous year was a
``casual date or pick-up.'' Well below 1 percent reported paying
for sex.
   Of the men reporting sex in the previous year, 3 percent said
their partners included males and another 6 percent didn't answer
the question. Homosexual men make up the largest group of AIDS
patients in the United States.
   CDC researchers ``really didn't know what to expect'' from the
survey, Darrow said, noting there have been no definitive
scientific sexual behavior studies in recent years. The
ground-breaking Kinsey report on sexual behavior is too
unscientifically based and is 40 years old.
   The survey reported Thursday included adults living in
households; prisoners and transients were not included, ``and they
may be at greater risk,'' Darrow said.
   The survey was conducted by the National Opinion Research
Center, a private center which has conducted surveys on social
issues since 1972. The center receives funding from the National
Science Foundation, and shared its research with federal health
officials, Darrow said.
   The survey was conducted between Feb. 14 and April 25. The
margin of error varies from finding to finding, depending on a
number of variables, but is believed to be less than 4 percent
overall, NORC researchers said.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
was stopped as he left the State Department on Thursday to hear an
appeal from an Armenian dissident who wants to visit his ailing
mother.
   Amvarsam Khlgatian, 61, had been waiting for two hours across
the street carrying a placard that read, ``Gorbachev, Let Me Visit
My Dying Mother,'' while Shevardnadze met inside with Secretary of
State George P. Shultz.
   As the motorcade started for the Soviet embassy, Khlgatian
dashed into the street carrying his placard. The motorcade stopped
and startled security agents wrestled Khlgatian to the ground.
   Shevardnadze left his limousine to talk to the demonstrator for
a few minutes.
   ``He said, `Don't worry, I`ll take care of it','' Khlgatian said
afterward. ``But he can do nothing. It's up to the KGB.''
   Khlgatian said he made a similar appeal to Shevardnadze in New
York a few months ago ``and he said the same thing.''
   The protester said he was exiled from the Soviet Union in 1979
after serving 15 years in labor camps for attempting to escape to
the West. He said he works as a machinist in New York.
   Khlgatian gave Shevardnadze a leaflet in which he described his
mother as 80 years old and fatally ill. It said General Secretary
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, despite promises of humanization, had kept
him from visiting her in Yerevan, the Armenian capital.
   ``For me, no matter who was and who is on the top, there wasn't
and isn't justice on the bottom,'' the leaflet said. It concluded
with an appeal for help.
   Later, returning for another session with Secretary of State
George P. Shultz, the Soviet foreign minister said he had never met
the demonstrator before.
   Asked about his appeal, Shevardnadze said: ``I am looking into
it. ... This is the human approach.''

<HEAD>Summer Goes into Overtime on Gulf Coast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The northern border states had a chilly afternoon Thursday, but
summer remained in full throttle across the Gulf Coast region, even
as fall officially began at 3:29 p.m. EDT.
   Temperatures of 90 to 95 degrees with high humidity extended
across Florida Alabama and the lower Mississippi Valley to eastern
portions of Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas.
   A cooler air mass along the Canadian border kept afternoon
temperatures in the 50s and 60s in northern states.
   Dividing the two air masses, a frontal system extended across
Illinois, Iowa, the central Plains and the central Rockies. Showers
and thunderstorms were scattered to the north of the front from the
southern Great Lakes to the upper Mississippi Valley.
   The strongest thunderstorms early Thursday afternoon were
developing over northern Iowa and in parts of southern Wisconsin
and northern Illinois. A few showers also occurred over the
northern and central Plains, Mississippi and Florida.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
about a half-inch at Milwaukee and at Muskegon, Mich.; and about a
third of an inch at Lansing, Mich.; Madison, Wis.; and Grand
Rapids, Mich..
   Across the front in the central Plains, there were sharp
temperature contrasts. At 2 p.m. CDT, Lincoln, Neb., had 67 degrees
while Topeka, Kan., about 150 miles away, had 93 degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 47
degrees at Port Angeles, Wash., to 95 degrees at Jacksonville Naval
Air Station in Florida and Fort Polk, La. The low in the nation
Thursday morning was 22 degrees at Truckee, Calif.
   For Friday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from New England across the northern and central Appalachians, the
Ohio Valley and southern Missouri to Oklahoma. Showers and
thunderstorms should be most numerous in northern New England and
portions of New York state and western Pennsylvania. Widely
scattered showers and thunderstorms were expected in central and
southern Florida and from the central Rockies to the central high
Plains. Light rain was predicted near the Washington and Oregon
coast.
   High temperatures were forecast to be in the 70s and 80s across
most of the nation. Highs should be in the 90s in much of Oklahoma,
Texas, the lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys, the Gulf Coast
states, the southern Atlantic Coastal states and in the desert
Southwest. Temperatures should only reach the 60s in the Pacific
Northwest and from northern Minnesota to northern Michigan and in
Maine.

   Tanks and troops rolled into two southern Soviet
republics Thursday where protesters in an ethnic dispute attacked a
prosecutor's office, rallied by the hundreds of thousands and
staged strikes.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev told a news briefing
in Moscow: ``The situation is not improving. It has become even
more threatening.''
   Authorities imposed a 9 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew in Stepanakert,
the main city of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, center of the dispute
between Armenians and Azerbaijanis that's been going on since
February. Violence in the region this week killed one person and
hurt 48.
   Protesters, who want the area to be taken from Azerbaijan and
made part of Armenia, attacked the city's prosecutor's office in
Stepanakert Thursday.
   ``There are soldiers on every street, at every crossroad,
checking passports and personal cars,'' said a man who answered the
telephone at the state radio and television office, Gostelradio, in
Stepanakert.
   Nagorno-Karabakh, in the Caucasus Mountains, was virtually at a
standstill and sealed off because of ethnic tension.
   In Yerevan, capital of the Armenian republic, about 700,000
people flooded the streets for a three-hour rally Thursday night
despite heavy presence by police and thousands of soldiers, said
resident Arpine Popoyan.
   The Foreign Ministry closed Azerbaijan to foreign journalists
Thursday, a day after barring travel to Armenia. It gave no reason.
   Asked the mood of Armenians, Mrs. Popoyan's 17-year-old son,
Vahagen, replied: ``Fighting.''
   Dozens of tanks and armored personnel carriers were deployed and
soldiers guarded government and Communist Party buildings in
Yerevan, Mrs. Popoyan said by telephone.
   ``It's very tense. Everyone is at the edge,'' she said.
   She said several deputies of the Armenian Supreme Soviet, the
republic's parliament, agreed at Thursday's rally to push again for
an emergency session to renew demands to annex Nagorno-Karabakh. A
rally was set for Friday and Armenians vowed to pursue their
general strike until they get an answer, she said.
   Armenian authorities on Wednesday refused to hold such a session.
   State-run television showed armored personnel carriers in
Yerevan and said similar measures were taken in 16 other areas of
Armenia with a ``mixed population,'' apparently meaning areas where
both Armenians and Azerbaijanis live. Armenia has a population of
3.4 million.
   The official news agency Tass said a strike that began in
Yerevan Sept. 16 spread to three other towns and an entire district
of the republic.
   An editor for Armenia's official news agency, Armenpress, who
demanded anonymity, said food stores were open in Yerevan, but
public transportation was not working and many people were on the
streets.
   Perfiliev said one man was killed and 48 people were hurt this
week in clashes in Nagorno-Karabakh, which has been part of
Azerbaijan since 1923 despite its historical links to Armenia and
mostly Armenian population.
   He said the dead man and 32 of the injured were Armenians. The
other casualties were Azerbaijani. Perfiliev reported beatings,
mauraudings and more than 30 buildings burned down.
   Perfiliev blamed it on ``corrupt elements'' trying to distract
attention from Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms.
   ``Such a situation, of course, cannot be tolerated ...,'' he
said. ``The alternative was to take urgent and tough measures.''
   In Tbilisi, a city 1,000 miles south of Moscow, dozens of
uniformed police manhandled Georgian nationalists Thursday when
they tried to protest near the site of a U.S.-Soviet citizens
conference. Activists said at least 15 demonstrators were detained.
   Although Stepanakert was under a curfew, most people stayed home
voluntarily because they feared more violence, said the man at
Gostelradio, who refused to give his name.
   Mrs. Popoyan's husband, Armenian activist and former political
prisoner Rafael Popoyan, said from Yerevan that soldiers patrolling
Stepanakert had permission to search houses at will. Mrs. Popoyan
said Stepanakert residents, kept from going out on the streets,
shouted from their windows in protest Wednesday night.
   The man at Gostelradio said food stores, the newspaper and radio
and television stations were operating, but public transportation,
schools and most workplaces in Stepanakert were closed. He said no
demonstrations were held because of a ban and few people were on
the streets.
   The Armenpress editor said protesters rallied Thursday morning
in Yerevan, but ``there isn't any disorder, and there won't be.''
   Radio Moscow said protesters attacked the regional prosecutor's
office in Stepanakert, but did not say when.
   ``There were also arson attacks. Several cars were put on fire.
Shooting was heard in several places. These and other illegal
activities claimed casualties. Law enforcement agencies took steps
to put an end to mass-scale disorders,'' it said.
   Tension rose markedly in Nagorno-Karabakh after a shoot-out
Sunday in Khadzhaly, near Stepanakert, killed one man and wounded
at least 25 people.

<HEAD>South Africa Bans Anti-Apartheid Conference</HEAD>

   The government on Thursday
banned a national anti-apartheid conference planned for this
weekend, and a fourth activist took refuge in the U.S. Consulate
after escaping from detention.
   Organizers had depicted the Cape Town conference as one of the
most important anti-apartheid gatherings in 30 years. More than 70
groups, with members ranging from black militants to liberal white
Parliament members, had planned to discuss strategies for
countering repression of dissent.
   The ban was part of a crackdown on opposition.
   Earlier Thursday, authorities backed off in the case of the
latest escape by a detainee, who joined three other anti-apartheid
activists holed up at the U.S. Consulate. Police issued, then
withdrew an arrest warrant for Clifford Ngcobo, who escaped
Wednesday while being treated at a hospital and fled to the
11th-floor consulate in a downtown Johannesburg office building.
   Consular officials allowed Ngcobo to remain while his case is
assessed, U.S. Embassy spokesman William Zavis said. The consular
officials earlier provided refuge for three prominent activists who
escaped Sept. 13.
   Zavis said he could not confirm reports that the consulate
turned away a fifth fugitive Wednesday night. Local news reports
said a black man sought by police was refused entry into the
consulate and later was taken into custody under security
legislation.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said in Washington
Thursday that the South Africans given refuge agreed not to have
contact with news media as a condition of their staying. This was
so the consulate could continue normal operations and avoid
activities incompatible with diplomatic activity, he said.
   Black activist Winnie Mandela visited the consulate Wednesday
and complained that U.S. officials would not let the detainees
contact reporters.
   Police pledged not to arrest the three initial escapees if they
leave the consulate, but Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok
confirmed that a multipronged crackdown against other activists is
under way.
   Across South Africa, more than two dozen activists were detained
or barred from political activities this week, offices of
anti-apartheid groups were raided, and pedestrians and motorists in
urban centers were subjected to random searches.
   Brig. Leon Mellet, spokesman for Vlok, announced the conference
ban. He said one goal of the conference was to promote disruption
of upcoming nationwide municipal elections.
   Activists advocate a boycott of the elections, saying the
segregated black council seats at stake are components of a
white-controlled system that excludes blacks from central
government.
   Mellet said participants in the conference were sympathetic to
the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement and were
seeking to fill the vaccuum created by the banning in February of
17 major anti-apartheid groups. The groups included the United
Democratic Front, a nationwide coalition.
   The crackdown comes during an upsurge of bombings, including
five in a 9-hour span late Wednesday and early Thursday.
Authorities said 38 people were injured, including 18 whites at a
Johannesburg bus terminal and 19 blacks at a disco on the other
side of the city.
   The disco owner said three white men left shortly before the
blast without drinking their beer.
   Police have blamed most recent bombings on the ANC. But
activists believe right-wing vigilantes or a covert security force
unit carried out the recent bombing of a Johannesburg building used
by anti-apartheid groups.
   Redman said of Ngcobo: ``He indicates that he is a member of the
United Democratic Front and had been in detention for five months
prior to his escape. He is now in temporary refuge with the three
other ... activists.''
   The three are Murphy Morobe and Mohammed Valli Moosa, leaders of
the UDF, and Vusi Khanyile, chairman of the banned National
Education Crisis Committee.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   Troops fired live
ammunition and plastic bullets to put down widespread Palestinian
demonstrations Thursday, including an attack by masked, ax-wielding
youths. Twenty-four Palestinians were wounded, Arab hospital
officials said.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin escaped injury during a tour of
the Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis when a Palestinian assailant
hurled a chunk of cement from a nearby rooftop. Soldiers rushed to
the site but made no arrests.
   Rabin said mass arrests of grass-roots activists in Gaza
succeeded in curbing large-scale riots, but added: ``Have we
succeeded in bringing stone throwing to a standstill? Not yet.''
   Rabin said he did not see the rock hurled Thursday but said
about 80 percent of the violence in Gaza involved stone-throwing.
   Also Thursday, the army said four soldiers would face trial in
the beating death of an elderly Palestinian man, Khader Al Tarazi,
in Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp.
   Israel radio said they were to be charged with manslaughter. It
said the soldiers struck the man with clubs after they broke into
his home Aug. 22 to arrest Palestinian youths suspected of throwing
stones.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, dozens of Palestinian youths
marched through the casbah, or market, chanting anti-Israeli
slogans, waving Palestinian flags and holding pictures of PLO chief
Yasser Arafat, an army spokesman said.
   The youths wore Arab headscarves wrapped around their faces and
garbage bags over their clothes to hide their identities.
   They attacked troops with rocks and axes. Soldiers responded
with plastic bullets and live ammunition, an army spokeswoman said.
   Sixteen Palestinians were wounded in the clash, including a
12-year-old shot in the right hand and two 16-year-olds hit in the
stomach, officials at Nablus' Al Ittihad Hospital said. They said
four other Palestinians were wounded in clashes in villages near
Nablus.
   Other Arab hospital officials said four Palestinians were
wounded in the Gaza Strip, including a 13-year-old boy who was shot
in the chest and rushed to Tel Aviv's Tel Hashomer hospital in
serious condition.
   Acording to the army and to a military spokesman, 11
Palestinians were wounded in Nablus and nearby Burka village and
three were wounded in Gaza, including one listed in serious
condition.
   Rabin credited the use of plastic bullets against stone throwers
for a recent upsurge in casualties and said they reduced violence
in the territories.
   According to army orders, troops can fire plastic bullets at the
legs of stone throwers even if soldiers' lives are not in danger.
   Unlike live ammunition, Israeli officials say plastic bullets
are not generally lethal when fired at a distance of 20 yards or
more.
   Rabin also said Israel would never relinquish control over the
occupied territories to the United Nations before peace
negotiations as demanded by Arafat last week in France.
   ``I would like to clarify that all the PLO talk about the
possibility that some international entity will come here is mere
chatter,'' Rabin said.
   A think tank, the independent Jerusalem Center for Public
Affairs, on Thursday reported 191,700 Jews live on captured Arab
land, about two-thirds in Israeli-annexed Arab east Jerusalem.
   After the 1967 war, Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip
and annexed Arab east Jerusalem.
   Also Thursday, six Americans whose passports were seized by the
army for allegedly participating in an anti-Israeli demonstration
said they refused to submit to Israeli questioning.
   ``We have neither committed or been charged with a crime,'' said
one of the Americans, Bill Doares of New York.
   A Foreign Ministry official said the six, who are on a tour
sponsored by a pro-Palestinian lobby group in San Francisco, were
``very active'' in an illegal demonstration in the West Bank town
of Ramallah.
   The Americans contend they were observing a march by Palestinian
women from a distance when their passports were seized Monday.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Lloyd Bentsen told a Silicon
Valley audience Thursday that the Republicans' ``do-nothing trade
policy'' has left the American military dangerously dependent on
imported computer parts.
   The Reagan administration turned its back while competitive
American businesses such as semiconductor manufacturers were
``devastated by unfair competition,'' the vice presidential
candidate told employees of the Intel Corp., one of the nation's
premier producer of computer chips.
   ``This administration talks tough on national defense ... but
their do-nothing trade policy has left us dependent on Japan for 40
percent of the computer chips used in our own weaponry,'' he said.
   ``I'm here to tell you that a Dukakis-Bentsen administration
will not rest until strong, competitive American companies like
Intel have an equal opportunity to compete around the world,''
Bentsen said.
   ``There is one clear difference in this election: Mike Dukakis
and Lloyd Bentsen support a trade policy for America.''
   With Dukakis back in Massachusetts, Bentsen was campaigning for
California's 47 electoral votes which both sides consider crucial
to winning the White House on Nov. 8.
   The area near the Intel plant voted for President Reagan over
his Democratic challenger, Walter Mondale, in 1984 by a margin of
58 percent to 41 percent, but Bentsen was warmly welcomed in the
crowded plant cafeteria.
   The Texas senator also delivered the same warning that Dukakis
gave in Boston _ that the Bush-Quayle ticket will try to use Social
Security funds to reduce the federal budget deficit if elected in
November.
   Over the past eight years, the Republican Party has ``waged
unrelenting warfare against Social Security,'' Bentsen said,
calling it ``guerrilla warfare'' in a later appearance in Everett,
Wash.
   And he urged the 300 workers outside the Scott Paper Co. plant
in Everett to watch Sunday's debate because ``George Bush isn't
going to be able to duck the issues any more.''
   ``George Bush doesn't get to vote very often,'' he told the
Intel employees. ``But one of the few votes he cast (as vice
president) scored a direct hit on Social Security benefits for your
parents and some of you.''
   Bentsen cited the occasion in May 1985 when Bush, presiding over
the Senate as vice president, cast the tie-breaking vote in favor
of freezing cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security benefits.
   ``They can wrap themselves in the flag, but they can't hide from
the truth on Social Security,'' he said. ``As Ronald Reagan said,
facts are troublesome things.''
   He also accused his GOP counterpart, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana,
of voting against programs benefiting the elderly.
   If the Republicans are elected, Bentsen said, ``man the
barricades and get a firm grip on your Social Security care''
because Bush will ``make a run at the benefits.''
   Democrats ``will never tamper with the system or loot the trust
fund,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis Camps Agree On Debate Panel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The presidential campaigns of Democrat Michael
Dukakis and Republican George Bush on Thursday settled their
squabble over the composition of the panel of journalists for their
Sunday night debate.
   Janet Brown, a spokeswoman for the Commission on Presidential
Debates, a group set up by both major political parties to organize
the debate, said the agreement was reached early Thursday evening.
   Jim Lehrer of public television's ``The McNeil-Lehrer Report''
will serve as moderator for the Sunday showdown in Winston-Salem,
N.C., Ms. Brown said.
   The panel of three journalists will be anchorman Peter Jennings
of ABC News, Anne Groer of The Orlando Sentinal and John Mashek of
The Atlanta Constitution, she said.
   The camps have not yet resolved who will serve on the panel for
the second debate next month in Los Angeles, Ms. Brown said.
   The resolution came a day after the two camps agreed that the
candidates will use lecterns of different heights for the debate.
   As for the panel of journalists, Dukakis aides had originally
suggested that it consist of the anchors from ABC, NBC, CBS and CNN.
   The Bush camp said that would be unfair to print journalists and
it submitted to the commission a list of 10 reporters it said it
would accept as members of the panel.
   Meanwhile, the Fox Broadcasting Co. announced that it will
broadcast the debate on a delayed basis. The network's 122
affiliated stations will show the debate in its entirety at 11
p.m., following regular Sunday night programming.

crippling transport ban on Thursday, then killed at least 15
soldiers in an attack on an army post with mortars and
catapult-launched dynamite, officials said.
   Eleven guerrillas were killed and 11 soldiers were wounded in
the attack in eastern Morazan province, according to a communique
issued by the Armed Forces Press Office.
   The raid lasted two to three hours and appeared to be one of the
most successful guerrilla operations in recent months.
   Marxist-led rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front have fought the the U.S.-backed centrist government for
nearly nine years. About 65,000 people, mostly civilians, have been
killed.
   Lt. Salvador Gonzalez said the attack began at 1 a.m. (3 a.m.
EDT) with rebels firing mortar rounds and charges of TNT into a
communications post on Avocado Hill, north of Corinto, 120 miles
northeast of San Salvador.
   Gonzalez, spokesman for the 3rd Army Brigade, spoke by telephone
from San Miguel, headquarters for military operations in the
eastern third of this small Central American country.
   He said the rebels used catapults, similar to those used in
medieval times, to launch explosives into the base defended by
about 50 men. The guerrillas then attacked with rifle fire, he said.
   The raid began an hour after the end of a guerrilla-imposed road
traffic ban that paralyzed most transportation nationwide since
Monday. In lifting the ban, the rebels called on supporters to step
up sabotage of vehicles that ignored the measure.
   The guerrillas also stepped up sabotaging power transmission
lines in several of El Salvador's 14 provinces.
   Bus and truck traffic returned to normal during morning rush
hour. The rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos said the ban _ the
fifth this year _ was lifted as of midnight Wednesday.
   At least three vehicles were burned during the ban, which
reduced bus and truck traffic in the capital by about 70 percent.
Traffic on provincial highways was almost completely paralyzed.
   Some buses and trucks that operated since Monday covered their
license plates trying to avoid reprisals.
   The guerrillas blew up about 35 utility posts or high-tension
wire towers after the transport ban began, military sources said.
Four eastern provinces were without electricity early Thursday
because of overnight sabotage.

   Vice President George Bush, claiming there is no
longer any need to ``match the Soviets bullet for bullet and tank
for tank,'' said Thursday he would work on reordering U.S.
conventional defenses if elected.
   The ``Competitive Strategies Initiative'' would involve using
conventional weaponry ``in new ways,'' put heavy emphasis on naval
forces and use high technology to deploy and mobilize conventional
forces in Europe, aides said.
   Democratic rival Michael Dukakis has made beefed-up conventional
forces a cornerstone of his campaign.
   Aides said Bush's comments, at a $3.1 million Texas fund-raiser
in which he shared the stage with President Reagan, could pave the
way _ under certain circumstances _ for U.S. troop reductions in
Europe in the future, although Bush did not automatically favor
such a reduction.
   And one senior campaign adviser, speaking only on the condition
of anonymity, said that elements of Bush's so-called ``Competitive
Strategies Initiative'' would be embraced by the outgoing Reagan
administration and announced within the next few days by Defense
Secretary Frank Carlucci.
   ``It marks a change in the way we utilize forces, using
conventional weaponry in new ways,'' the official said.
   Meanwhile, Reagan, here to help Bush's presidential candidacy
and to raise money for the party, said Democrats ``use our words
and borrow our tune but the song is way out of key.''
   Reagan said prevailing Democratic Party views on national
defense would make two prominent late Texans _ President Lyndon
Johnson and House Speaker Sam Rayburn _ ``shake their heads in
wonder and confusion.''
   Serving as a warmup speaker for Bush, Reagan accused Dukakis of
flip-flopping on such questions as support for the B-1 bomber.
   Without mentioning Dukakis' name, Reagan told 2,500 GOP faithful
that ``we believe in a national defense that defends our shores and
our allies by land, air and sea _ and very soon, space, through the
Strategic Defense Initiative.''
   ``But the opposition wants to reduce the size of our Navy, right
at a critical moment when the Soviets are building up their naval
presence in the Pacific,'' he said.
   Reagan, in particular, reiterated his call for a 600-ship Navy.
Bush aides said the candidate's new defense proposal, likewise,
would put heavy emphasis on naval forces.
   Bush, here after a brief foray into Dukakis' backyard to collect
the endorsement of a Boston police union, discussed his defense
proposals without getting into specifics.
   He said in prepared remarks his Competitive Strategies
Initiative would be ``based on the idea of putting our strengths
against our competitor's weaknesses.''
   He said the initiative had been under study for two years in the
``Reagan-Bush Defense Department.'' He said he would make the
program, and working on it with U.S. allies, ``a high priority in
my administration.''
   The plan is based on ``existing weapons systems and those we
have in the pipeline now,'' Bush said.
   ``It is designed to ensure that we need not match the Soviets
bullet for bullet and tank for tank,'' Bush said.
   In general, the proposal involves using high technology systems
for mobilizing and deploying forces, principally for the defense of
Europe in the wake of the new U.S.-Soviet treaty to eliminate
intermediate-range nuclear missiles, aides said.
   Asked if Bush's remarks could suggest a movement toward reducing
the number of U.S. troops in Europe, Bush spokeswoman Alixe Glen
said, ``it could. It could mean there would be less emphasis on
that.''
   However, she said that the initiative did not automatically mean
that Bush favored such a reduction.
   And Dennis Ross, Bush's foreign-policy adviser, said that the
proposal ``is simply a new management process for spending our
money smarter in new weapons systems of the future.''
   Bush said he would detail the proposal in the weeks ahead.
   In the speech here and in an earlier address to Republican
activists and college students on the campus of Baylor University
in Waco, Texas, Reagan accused the Democrats of moderating their
views on national security issues in response to public opinion
polls.
   Reagan said Dukakis and Democratic running mate Lloyd Bentsen of
Texas had adopted his and Bush's issues.
   ``You'll hear them say there are no disagreements between them
and us about these bedrock principles,'' Reagan said. ``But it just
doesn't sound right. They use our words and borrow our tune, but
the song is way out of key.''
   The joint appearance by Reagan and Bush was their second since
Bush was nominated as the Republican presidential candidate in New
Orleans last Aug. 17. The pair appeared together at a rally in Los
Angeles a week later.
   During the Waco speech earlier, Reagan seemed to be poking fun
at the attempt in recent weeks by the Dukakis campaign to burnish
the Massachusetts governor's defense credentials, particularly the
decision to have Dukakis don a helmet and pose in a military tank.
   ``Lately, some liberal leaders have seen what was happening to
them in the polls and had a death-bed conversion,'' he told some
9,000 cheering students and others in the Baylor University
athletic center. ``They'd have you believe that they're born-again
George Pattons. But if we go the way they want to go, our defenses
will run out of gas in no time.''
   Gen. George Patton was a renowned World War II combat hero.

   A tearful 19-year-old woman hugging a
stuffed animal broke down on the witness stand Thursday while
testifying that a group of men took turns raping her on the hood of
a car as she tried to resist.
   ``I was screaming and telling him to stop,'' she said Thursday
of 23-year-old Orlando Garza, the first of 10 men indicted in the
case to stand trial. ``He was holding my legs. I was trying to push
him off.''
   Garza is being tried in District Court in Duval County on a
charge of sexual assault. He also faces a charge of aggravated
kidnapping.
   Later during her testimony, the woman was overcome with tears
and said she was about to faint. Counselors from Crisis Services of
Corpus Christi escorted her from the small courtroom packed with a
standing-room-only crowd of about 150.
   She resumed testifying Thursday afternoon, and faced
cross-examination by defense attorney Albert Pena, who is
attempting to show that the woman was involved in an affair with
the defendant and was a consenting sexual partner that night.
   The woman testified she had never been romantically involved
with Garza.
   Pena asked the woman if she was drunk the night of the alleged
gang rape, and she responded that she drank only half a beer.
   Pena asked why she waited several hours to report the incident
to the police. ``Because we didn't have a phone and I didn't know
where to go,'' she said.
   ``How many other times did Orlando Garza rape you?'' Pena asked.
   She testified earlier that Garza had raped her at her house
three days before the gang rape, but that she had been afraid to
tell anyone, including her husband.
   The woman, a mother of two, said the gang rape began while she
walked a short distance home from a relative's home about midnight
on March 26, after her husband had gone to a party.
   During the walk, she said, she declined to ``go riding'' with
Garza and three other men indicted in the case, and, ``They grabbed
me and pushed me in the car.'' She said Garza and the others were
her neighbors in this South Texas town of 5,000 people.
   The men took her north of town, outside a shed where an illegal
cockfight was taking place, the woman testified.
   The woman said Garza stayed in the back seat with her and forced
her to perform oral sex on him, while the others went to see the
roosters fight.
   ``I was trying to pull myself up, but I couldn't because his
hands were real heavy and he was pushing me down,'' she said.
   After that, she said Corando Perez walked back to the car and
told Garza, ``to save him some.''
   Perez, 26, of San Diego, also faces sexual assault and
aggravated kidnapping trials in connection with the alleged gang
rape.
   Perez pulled her head by the hair and forced her to perform oral
sex while he stood outside the car, she said.
   Then she said he climbed in the back seat and told her, ``You're
going to like this,'' before forcing her to have anal intercourse.
   The woman named at least two other men who she said took turns
raping and and sodomizing her simultaneously.
   Jose Carlos Briones, 29, also facing a sexual assault charge,
only fondled her, she said, because he was impotent. Briones
testified for the prosecution ealier in the trial, and was offered
a recommendation for probation in return for his testimony.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush came to his rival's
back yard Thursday to accept the endorsement of the Boston Police
Patrolmen's Association, New England's largest police union.
   It was the second visit by the Republican presidential nominee
to Boston this month.
   The vote was viewed by Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis as ``personally devastating,'' according to the attorney
for the union.
   As Dukakis planned a hasty counter-rally outside his governor's
office at the Statehouse, Bush visited a restaurant in East Boston
and criticized Dukakis as being soft on crime.
   ``Who was it said that the police aren't there when you need
them?'' said Bush as he stood flanked by some 50 patrolmen, all of
them elected representatives of the police union.
   ``I'm here to receive this endorsement but also to make it clear
that I'm the one in this race who wants to strengthen law
enforcement,'' Bush told the room full of reporters, about 150
supporters and police. ``Our first priority must be to keep the
criminals away from the people who want to live in peace and
safety.''
   Two hours after the mid-day rally, Dukakis surrounded himself
with scores of law enforcement officials, top elected officials and
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo. Dukakis said: ``We're here today to
investigate a felony: assault and battery on the truth.
   ``What George Bush is doing to the truth in this campaign is a
crime. We're here to give George Bush what Joe Friday used to ask
for: the facts, ma'am, just the facts.''
   The Bush rally stemmed from a 51-0 vote by elected officers of
the patrolmen's association Wednesday to endorse Bush for
president. It was not the first time the union has endorsed a
Republican. In 1980 and 1984 the association supported Ronald
Reagan and in 1984 it endorsed Republican Ray Shamie in his
unsuccessful Senate bid against John Kerry.
   But Dukakis himself, in a conversation with union attorney Frank
McGee on Wednesday afternoon, said according to McGee that the
union endorsement would do him great harm.
   ``I hope these guys realize that if they go ahead and do this,
that I would regard this as personally devastating to me,'' McGee
quoted Dukakis as saying.
   In his rally Thursday, Dukakis said that unlike Bush, he
supports providing federal assistance to local law enforcement
agencies.
   And Dukakis countered criticism of his past support for
furloughs for first-degree murderers by saying that the Reagan-Bush
administration last year gave some 16,000 furloughs, some as long
as 40 days, to convicted drug pushers.
   Patrolmen's Association President Robert Guiney told the crowd
at the Bush rally that Dukakis ``is no friend of police.''
   ``During his term as governor, he has presided over a revolving
door criminal justice system,'' Guiney said. ``We are ever mindful
of his total opposition to capital punishment, especially in view
of our recent tragic loss of three outstanding officers who paid
the supreme sacrifice in the line of duty.''
   One of the patrolmen also criticized Dukakis' absence in the
past year from the funerals of those three officers killed on the
job.
   Earlier this month Bush came to Boston Harbor to spotlight what
he called Dukakis' tolerance of delay in cleaning up polluted
Boston Harbor.
   Dukakis has been endorsed by the Massachusetts Police
Association, the Massachusetts Police Chiefs Association, the state
district attorneys and the 14 county sheriffs, two of whom are
Republican. Dukakis has also won the endorsement of a number of
out-of-state law enforcement groups.
   The Boston police force is the largest in New England as is its
patrolmen's union, which has 1,621 members. Endorsements are made
by 54 patrolmen who are elected representatives. Of those, 51
attended the Wednesday night session and all voted for Bush.

   Republican George Bush touted his endorsement by Michael
Dukakis' hometown police union Thursday, prompting Dukakis to
surround himself with other law officers and accuse his rival of
``assault and battery on the truth.''
   ``What George Bush is doing to the truth in this campaign is a
crime,'' the Democratic presidential nominee said in perhaps his
strongest attack on Bush to date. ``His administration has waged
not a war on crime, but a war on crime programs.''
   The sharp rhetoric came three days before Dukakis and Bush were
to face each other in the first of their two nationally televised
debates _ confrontations that both sides consider crucial.
   The bipartisan commission on debates announced Thursday that Jim
Lehrer of public television's MacNeil@Lehrer NewsHour would be
moderator Sunday in Winston-Salem, N.C., and panelists would be
Peter Jennings of ABC News, Anne Groer of the Orlando Sentinel and
John Mashek of the Atlanta Constitution.
   And an NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll released Thursday
showed Bush and Dukakis essentially tied, with Bush's 45-41 lead
softened by a 2 point margin of error. The lead for Bush was lower
than the 47-40 recorded for Bush last month, and the survey of
2,630 likely voters found he had lost support among Reagan
Democrats, going from 35 percent to 25 percent.
   Furthermore, half the respondents thought Indiana Sen. Dan
Quayle was a bad choice to be Bush's running mate.
   Meanwhile, President Reagan was back on the campaign trail for
his vice president in Texas, scorning ``born-again George Pattons''
who say they support a strong national defense. It was an apparent
reference to Dukakis, who spent last week sounding hawkish as he
laid out his defense policies and rode in a modern M-1 tank.
   Reagan spoke to students at Baylor University in Waco, then was
joining Bush at a big fund-raising dinner in Houston.
   Bush also stressed defense issues and hinted that the
administration was on the verge of unveiling a new strategy for the
defense of Europe with conventional weaponry.
   Without offering specifics, Bush said that what he called the
``Competitive Strategies Initiative'' would be ``based on the idea
of putting our strengths against our competitor's weaknesses.''
Dukakis has offered what a ``conventional defense initiative'' to
counter the Reagan administration emphasis on Star Wars.
   Bush traveled to Boston to pick up the endorsement of the Boston
Police Patrolmen's Association, a 1,500 member union.
   ``I'm the one in this race who wants to strengthen law
enforcement,'' declared Bush. ``My opponent is strongly out of the
American mainstream on issues such as fighting crime.''
   Although Dukakis has won the backing of other police groups in
his state and in Bush's adopted home state of Texas, a spokesman
for the Boston police group said its members felt Bush would be
more attentive to law enforcement needs than would the
Massachusetts governor.
   Robert T. Guiney, president of the association, called Dukakis
``no friend of police.'' He cited Dukakis' opposition to the death
penalty, his support for a former program granting weekend
furloughs for convicted felons, and Dukakis' failure to attend
funerals for three police officers recently.
   However, it was not the first time the union has endorsed a
Republican. In 1980 and 1984 the association supported Reagan and
in 1984 it endorsed Republican Ray Shamie in his unsuccessful
Senate bid against John Kerry.
   The visit was Bush's second to Boston as the Republican
presidential nominee. Earlier this month he denounced Dukakis for
failing to clean up pollution in Boston Harbor.
   Dukakis responded a few hours after Bush spoke today with a
rally _ scheduled hastily in hopes of blunting the Bush endorsement
_ on the Massachusetts Statehouse steps. The governor was
surrounded by police officers from Massachusetts and eight other
states.
   He declared Bush a ``fugitive from the truth'' who has
shamelessly portrayed himself as a crimefighter and advocate of the
environment, education and elderly.
   He was joined by New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who accused Bush of
pandering. ``I'm tired of the simplistics and the distortions by
people like the vice president,'' Cuomo said.
   Dukakis' counterpunch overshadowed his only previously planned
event of the day _ an appearance at a senior citizens center where
he accused Bush of trying to harm Social Security.
   Accompanied by his 85-year-old mother Euterpe, Dukakis blasted
Bush for a 1985 vote against cost-of-living increases for Social
Security recipients. He said Bush once described Social Security as
``largely a welfare program.''
   ``When election time rolls around, Mr. Bush likes to say he is a
great friend of older Americans,'' Dukakis said. ``Maybe he thinks
we all have amnesia.''
   Democratic running mate Lloyd Bentsen campaigned in California's
Silicon Valley and said the Reagan administration turned its back
while industries such as semi-conductor manufacturers were
``devastated by unfair competition.''
   ``This administration talks tough on national defense ... but
their do-nothing trade policy has left us dependent on Japan for 40
percent of the computer chips used in our own weaponry,'' Bentsen
said.
   In other developments:
   _Bush aides said their campaign will spend a modern record on
television advertising. The campaign plans to spend 60 percent of
its $54 million budget _ or $32.4 million _ on television ads.
   _Bush chief of staff Craig Fuller said Bush complained to a
high-level Panama official about drug-money laundering during a
visit five years ago. But Fuller said Bush did not discuss it with
Panama strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   He commented on a British television documentary quoting a
former senior aide to Noriega as saying Bush had complained to
Noriega about money laundering. That assertion is counter to Bush's
contention that the Reagan administration took action against
Noriega as soon as it learned of alleged drug activity.

   Hurricane Helene's winds strengthened to 110 mph in
the mid-Atlantic on Thursday, but forecasters said the storm was
still no threat to land.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, the center of the 250-mile wide storm was at
latitude 14.1 north and longitude 44.3 west, or about 1,020 miles
east of the Caribbean island of Barbados.
   Helene was moving west-northwest at 10 mph and was expected to
continue that track and speed through Thursday.
   ``This is a very good hurricane _ it's already something to
reckon with,'' National Hurricane Center forecaster Miles Lawrence
said. ``But the currents suggest it is going to turn to the north _
it's just too early to speculate.''
   Air currents from a low pressure trough over the ocean may draw
Helene northward into the open Atlantic, away from the Caribbean
islands and North America, Lawrence said.
   Helene showed signs of northwest movement by late Thursday. But
if it heads into the eastern Caribbean, islands could be affected
by early next week, said Lawrence.
   In the meantime, Helene was growing stronger and more organized
as it moved westward across the Atlantic from its spawning grounds
near the the Cape Verde Islands off the African coast.
   Helene is the eighth named storm of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane
season. Storms become hurricanes when sustained winds reach a
minimum 74 mph.
   Of the season's three previous hurricanes, Gilbert swept across
the Caribbean and Mexico, killing hundreds, but the other two,
Florence and Debby, caused only minor damage in Mexico and the U.S.
Gulf Coast.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government soldiers rounded up
10 people from this village, accused them of collaborating with
leftist rebels and killed them with grenades and rifle fire,
relatives and neighbors said Thursday.
   The killings Wednesday in San Francisco, a tiny farming town 30
miles east of San Salvador, appear to constitute the biggest mass
slaying of civilians in this war-ravaged country in four years.
   The Armed Forces Press Office reported earlier Thursday that 10
``subversives'' were killed Wednesday just outside San Francisco.
   It said troopers of the Jiboa Battalion ``surprised a group of
extremists of the FMLN who were moving through the area.'' It
described the confrontation as ``fierce combat.''
   Marxist-led rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front, or FMLN, have fought El Salvador's U.S.-backed centrist
government for nearly nine years.
   But more than 10 witnesses to Wednesday's incident interviewed
by The Associated Press said there was no combat and that the 10
men and women killed had been taken from their homes or detained as
they carried out chores or walked along village paths on errands.
   Several of those interviewed by the AP were detained along with
most of the village's inhabitants in the local schoolhouse. They
said the three women and one of the men killed were taken from the
schoolhouse and marched about a mile to a ravine where six other
village men were detained.
   Three explosions, presumably grenades, were heard at about 3:30
p.m. Wednesday, followed by a steady fusillade of rifle fire, the
villagers said.
   Local residents were prevented by the troopers from going the
place of the killings Wednesday evening. The villagers found the
bodies early Thursday morning.
   An officer at the Armed Forces Press Office, asked about the
villagers' version of events, said the armed forces had no further
information to modify its earlier report. But the officer, who
declined to give his name, said the matter would be investigated.
   The 10 bodies were covered while still in the ravine with a
banner proclaiming a slogan of the leftist guerrilla group.
   Villagers put the bodies in hammocks Thursday afternoon and
carried them to the local churchyard, where relatives mourned their
dead. Some of the bodies were disfigured by explosions or shrapnel.
   Relatives identified the victims as: Teresa Argueta, 47; Maria
Zoila Rivas, 45; Maria Jesus Sibrian, 27; Jose Maria Flores, Jose
Alfaro, Nicolas Alfaro, Francisco Alfaro, Ulises Sibrian, Jose
Atilio Rivas and Jesus Zepeda.
   The ages of the men were not known.
   Maria Julia Argueta, Jose Atilio Rivas' common law wife, said
five Jiboa troopers arrived at the family's adobe house at 5:30
a.m. Wednesday. She said they searched it thoroughly, then took her
husband away and ordered her to remain inside with the couple's
three children.
   ``They said they were going to give him a talk, that they did
that whenever they went into a village,'' Mrs. Argueta, her eyes
red from crying, told the AP in the churchyard.
   Mrs. Argueta is also the sister of Teresa Argueta, one of the
slain women.
   Maria Gumersinda Melendez, 28, said she and her daughter,
Blanca, were walking to the nearby town of San Sebastian when they
were detained by the troopers at 6:30 a.m.
   The two said they were held in the schoolhouse all day with
about 35 of the village's approximately 70 residents, including
about a dozen children. At mid-afternoon, the soldiers called the
names of Ms. Argueta, Ms. Rivas and Ms. Sibrian along with those of
Francisco Alfaro and Rosa Emilia Rivas.
   The five stepped forward, were blindfolded and led out, they
said. Rosa Emilia Rivas told the AP that she was released outside
the schoolhouse, apparently because the soldiers realized they
wanted Maria Zoila Rivas instead of her.
   The women said the soldiers had a list of names from which they
appeared to be working. They said different soldiers who addressed
the detainees in the schoolhouse accused the villagers of
supporting the front.
   Rosa Emilia Rivas told the AP she believed she was being led out
to be killed when she was taken from the school.
   ``They called us collaborators (of the guerrillas),'' she said.
   ``I don't feel safe here anymore. I would like to leave, but I
don't have anywhere to go,'' she said.
   ``I feel a great fear about staying here,'' said Mrs. Argueta.
   The last mass killing of non-combatants attributed to the army
took place on Aug. 30, 1984 in the town of Las Vueltas in
Chalatenango province. Thirty-four civilians were killed there,
according to local and international human rights groups.
   No officer or soldier was prosecuted for that atrocity.

   President Daniel Ortega cancelled on
Thursday his scheduled visit to the United Nations because the U.S.
government delayed visas for about two dozen members of his
delegation, a government official announced.
   ``This arbitrary and illegal attitude constitutes a denial of
Nicaraguan rights,'' Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco
said in making the announcement at a news conference.
   On Wednesday, Nicaragua's U.N. Ambassador Alejandro Serrano
Caldera said the State Department was blocking visas for most
Nicaraguans who wanted to attend Ortega's speech to the General
Assembly in New York, including Ortega's wife and children.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Rudi Boone said he was
not aware of Ortega's cancellation of the trip. ``We have not seen
those reports yet,'' he said.
   Asked if the visas might be expedited to allow the trip, Boone
said, ``I could not say.''
   A State Department official in Washington earlier denied the
administration was blocking or delaying the visas.
   Earlier this month the State Department criticized the leftist
Nicaragua government for refusing to allow the United States to
replace Ambassador Richard Melton and seven other diplomats the
Sandinista government expelled on July 11. The Sandinista
government accused the diplomats of trying to destabilize the
country.
   The United States in turn expelled Nicaraguan Ambassador Carlos
Tunnerman and seven of his colleagues.
   Ortega family members, his doctor, chief of protocol and many of
his senior advisers were among the 22 to 25 Nicaraguans whose visas
were not processed in time for the Sept. 28 address, Serrano said.
   The Sandinista government protested ``the unjustified delay'' in
issuing the visas, according to a Foreign Ministry communique
broadcast over state-run radio Wednesday night.
   It said Nicaragua's representatives to the U.N. and the
Organization of American States had been instructed to ``intercede
before the State Department so that without major delays the visas
in question are granted.''
   The statement said the state of U.S.-Nicaraguan relations should
not be a factor in the issuance of the visas.
   ``In adopting this type of attitude, the United States clearly
ignores those commitments it has assumed as the host country of
international organizations, specifically violating existing
stipulations in the agreement between the United Nations and the
United States relative to the site of the United Nations,'' the
Foreign Ministry statement said.
   The State Department told the Nicaraguan mission that Ortega and
some senior Nicaraguan officials would have received their visas in
time for their scheduled arrival Friday, Serrano said on Wednesday.
   But he said the State Department also told the Nicaraguan
Mission that the other 22 to 25 visas would not be decided until
Oct. 4, a week after Ortega was to speak to the 159-member General
Assembly.
   The United States since 1981 has supported rebels seeking to
overthrow Nicaragua's Sandinista government.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman has said that in
addition to refusing replacements for Melton and the seven other
expelled diplomats, Nicaragua is not issuing visas to U.S.
diplomats assigned to replace envoys being routinely reassigned or
to personnel seeking to visit the embassy on official business.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Rebellious soldiers wound down
their purge of repressive army commanders Thursday but continued
hunting henchmen of the deposed Duvalier dynasty, independent radio
reports said.
   The new military government of Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril appealed
for an end to the lawlessness that began over the weekend, when a
coup toppled Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy and sent him into exile in the
neighboring Dominican Republic.
   A military communique carried on state television said: ``Formal
instructions have been passed on to the forces of order to arrest
all individuals committing acts of brigandage and pillaging.'' It
said violators would be ``duly tried and punished.''
   The army announced retirements or discharges of 29 officers,
most of whom were removed by rebellious soldiers.
   Radio Metropole, meanwhile, said staff at the army general
headquarters issued a 16-point declaration demanding elections,
higher pay, medical benefits, subsidized housing and commissary
privileges.
   It appeared the unit was speaking for itself, although their
demands reflected sentiments expressed earlier by enlisted men who
carried out the coup Saturday night.
   Radio Haiti Inter reported that soldiers hunted for members of
the Tonton Macoutes, who have long terrorized the population.
   The Tonton Macoutes were the dreaded private army of Francois
Duvalier's regime and that of his son, Jean-Claude. The 29-year
Duvalier dictatorship ended when the younger Duvalier was forced
into exile in February 1986.
   Avril, the former army adjutant, assumed the presidency early
Sunday.
   Since then, rank-and-file soldiers nationwide have revolted
against their commanders, depositing them handcuffed outside army
headquarters in Port-au-Prince, the capital.
   Radio Haiti Inter reported the ouster Thursday of two more
commanders _ in southwestern Cotes de Fer and the northern port of
St. Marc. That brought to 21 the number of commanders who served
under Namphy known to have been forcibly removed.
   Capt. Ernst Ravix, commander of the 40-man St. Marc barracks and
reputed Macoutes sympathizer, was ousted one day after soldiers
fired on demonstrators there, killing a 12-year-old boy and
wounding three people. The Cotes de Fer commander was not
identified.
   Radio Haiti Inter said that after Ravix was arrested and brought
to Port-au-Prince, soldiers launched a hunt for Tonton Macoutes.
   The High Command on Thursday night announced the retirement of
26 officers and the discharge of three others, most of them already
forced from command.
   Gerard Desmangles, head of the Commerce Ministry, was removed by
underlings. Tele-Haiti said the asssistant minister of immigration
also was removed by lower-ranking personnel, but his name was not
reported.
   Bernard Degraff, the government's assistant director of
information, said removal of unpopular officers was proceeding
peacefully.
   ``The ouster movement should cease very soon,'' Degraff said.
``Loss of control ... is still possible, but I have seen an
improvement in the situation.''
   Sporadic nighttime gunfire continued and there were reports of
more reprisal attacks, but for the most part the capital was calm
Thursday. Namphy's country retreat in Foret des Pins outside
Port-au-Prince was among the houses reported pillaged.
   ``What is happening now could mean the possible elimination of
Macoutism,'' Jean-Claude Bajeux, a leading human rights activist
and a center-left opposition leader.
   ``Now we can construct democracy. Soldiers are asking for
justice, law and order under the 1987 constitution.''
   Namphy suspended the constitution, which was approved by 99
percent of the voters in a referendum in March 1987.
   Avril said democracy was ``the ultimate goal of the military.''
On Monday he named a new Cabinet of 11 civilians and one military
man, but has never mentioned restoration of the constitution or
elections.
   Dr. Louis Roy, founder of the Haitian Red Cross and co-author of
the 1987 constitution, said he thought the political situation
remained dangerously unsettled.
   He said the purge of Macoutes under way now should have happened
when Jean-Claude Duvalier was overthrown.
   ``Macoutes were not punished then; they were encouraged by the
government,'' he said.
   Namphy headed a junta that promised a transition to democracy.
However, independently run general elections Nov. 29 were thwarted
when armed thugs supported by soldiers killed at least 33 people at
polling stations.
   Leslie Manigat, a civilian, was elected president in January in
military-run balloting that was boycotted by leading presidential
candidates amd marred by widespread irregularities. Namphy ousted
him in June.

<HEAD>U.N. Chief Says Peace In South-West Africa Closer Than Ever</HEAD>

   U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar said Thursday that independence is ``closer than
ever'' for South-West Africa.
   The territory, commonly known as Namibia, is Africa's last
colony and has been ruled by South Africa in defiance of United
Nations resolutions.
   Perez de Cuellar arrived early Thursday on his first visit to
South Africa since 1983 to discuss recent regional peace
initiatives which have revived the U.N.'s 10-year-old plan for
Namibian independence.
   ``We are closer than ever to a solution to the problem,'' the
Peruvian diplomat said at a cocktail party after a day of talks
with Namibian and South African officials.
   ``We hope that in the very near future you will have next to our
country a sister republic, the republic of Namibia,'' he said.
   Earlier, Perez de Cuellar met for more than two hours with
Foreign Minister Pik Botha. Both emerged to say progress had been
made.
   Botha was host of the subsequent reception, attended by more
than 200 guests of all races at a former presidential residence in
Pretoria.
   ``I would be kidding you if I said the U.N. was a popular
concept in South Africa,'' Botha told Perez de Cuellar at the
reception. ``But it is a privilege to have you here.''
   South Africa has agreed to end its 73-year rule over Namibia and
allow U.N. observers to oversee the transition to independence, but
only if the estimated 50,000 Cuban troops in neighboring Angola
withdraw.
   Cuba has agreed in principle to withdraw its troops, but there
is dispute over the timetable. U.S.-mediated talks involving
Angola, Cuba and South Africa, aimed at setting this timetable, are
to resume Monday in Brazzaville, Congo.
   Most opposition parties in Namibia rejected an invitation by
Perez de Cuellar to come to Pretoria for consultations, but members
of the territory's transitional, multiracial Cabinet met with him
for more than an hour Thursday.
   Perez de Cuellar was scheduled to meet President P.W. Botha on
Friday, then travel to Angola for talks with leaders of its Marxist
government.

   House Speaker Jim Wright denied Thursday that
he revealed anything classified when he criticized a covert CIA
operation in Nicaragua, while Republicans pressed for formal ethics
and intelligence investigations of the speaker's remarks.
   Wright, who has become a lightning rod for Democrats on Central
America policy, found himself again embroiled in controversy for
his revelation two days earlier that the Central Intelligence
Agency had instigated demonstrations aimed at provoking the leftist
Managua government and sabotaging peace talks with the Contra
rebels.
   The speaker repeated that assertion to reporters, but contended
such CIA activity was already well known through news reports.

   The House on Thursday passed election year
anti-drug legislation that would severely punish recreational users
and murderers alike, but it could face constitutional tests if
enacted into law.
   The 375-30 vote is not the final word on Congress' latest effort
to respond to Americans' fears over drug abuse. The Senate still
must consider its own anti-drug legislation, and a conference will
likely be needed to reconcile competing versions.
   Despite constitutional concerns, even by sponsors, the tug of
election-year politics was so strong that House members appeared
willing to enact the toughest possible bill and let the courts
decide the legal questions later.

   A former Mexican policeman was found guilty
Thursday of the 1985 kidnap and torture murder of a U.S. drug
agent, a slaying he once described to an undercover officer as ``a
mistake.''
   Raul Lopez Alvarez, 28, was convicted of killing Drug
Enforcement Administration agent Enrique Camarena and his pilot,
Alfredo Zavala Avelar.
   Three men were charged in the internationally sensitive case.
Jurors returned to court early Thursday to deliver their first
verdict after only one day of deliberation. They then returned to
the jury room to discuss charges against the other two defendants.
   Rene Verdugo Urquidez, 36, an admitted drug trafficker, also is
charged with Camarena's murder, and Jesus Felix Gutierrez, 38, is
charged with helping drug baron Rafael Caro Quintero escape from
Mexico after masterminding Camarena's murder.
   All three defendants appeared pale and shaken when the verdict

   Lebanon's army commander will be the
prime minister of a six-man military government, President Amin
Gemayel said in a decree issued in the last minutes of his
presidency Thursday.
   Gemayel's stunning choice of a military Cabinet, led by army
commander Gen. Michel Aoun, came after civilian Moslem figures
refused to take part in an interim Cabinet headed by a Maronite
Catholic premier.
   Gemayel, 45, had to name a transtition government because the
deeply divided Parliament failed to choose a new president
Thursday. The constitution bars Gemayel from seeking another
presidential term.
   Earlier Gemayel was trying to form a civilian government under
business tycoon Pierre Helou, 60, a Maronite Catholic who is a
Parliament deputy.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Rebellious soldiers wound down
their purge of repressive army commanders Thursday but continued
hunting henchmen of the deposed Duvalier dynasty, independent radio
reports said.
   The new military government of Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril appealed
for an end to the lawlessness that began over the weekend, when a
coup toppled Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy and sent him into exile in the
neighboring Dominican Republic.
   A military communique carried on state television said: ``Formal

all individuals committing acts of brigandage and pillaging.'' It

battle to go to school in Indiana, and three years since another
child with AIDS quietly entered schools in Massachusetts.
   For children infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, the
same uncertainty remains. Some started classes with little or no

   ``AIDS Kills,'' said one sign carried by protesters in Illinois.
``Help Keep AIDS Out of Our Schools,'' said another.

   The nation's savings institutions lost $7.5
billion in the first half of this year, the government reported
Thursday, as a Senate leader called for the biggest federal bailout
in history.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said S&Ls lost $3.6 billion in
the April-June quarter, a modest improvement over the $3.9 billion
loss of the first quarter.
   Nevertheless, the industry in only the first half of the year is
already approaching the post-Depression record loss of $7.8 billion
for all of 1987.
   Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire, D-Wis., who
is retiring after building a reputation as a penny-pinching
legislator during 31 years in office, said Thursday that the next
Congress will have to appropriate at least $20 billion _ about $81
for every man, woman and child in the country _ to bail out the
industry.

   The number of giant profitable corporations
that legally paid no federal income tax was cut by more than half
last year, according to a new study, but backers of the landmark
1986 tax overhaul said Thursday the figure may never drop to zero.
   Sixteen of 250 profitable companies surveyed by Citizens for Tax
Justice were able to wipe out their entire federal liability, down
from 40 in 1986 and 72 in 1982, according to Citizens for Tax
Justice, a Washington-based research group funded by unions,
churches and social groups. Some of the 16 disputed the report.
   Paul Huard, vice president of the National Association of
Manufacturers, criticized the report for what he called ``this
horror-story type of argument.'' It is unfair to look at a
company's taxes for one year only, he said, adding that ``the
nature of corporate profits and tax accounting being what it is,
you are going to get these cyclical variations from year to year.''

   WASHINGTON _ The Nuclear Regulatory Commission ruled Thursday
that before receiving a low-power license, Seabrook, N.H., plant
owners must prove they can pay to decommission their reactor if
they never secure a full-power commercial license.
   In a unanimous vote without debate, the commissioners ordered
Seabrook owners to submit a plan within 30 days that provides
``reasonable assurance that adequate funds will be available so
that safe decommissioning will be reasonably assured in the event
that low-power operation has occurred and a full-power license is
not granted.''
   Seabrook officials quickly expressed optimism that they would be
able to file a plan to pay for decommissioning that will satisfy
the commissioners.

   Senate Democrats failed Thursday to break a
Republican filibuster of a bill clouded in presidential politics to
raise the $3.35 an hour minimum wage for the first time since 1981.
   On a 53-43 vote _ six short of the 60 needed _ the Senate
refused to limit to 30 more hours debate on legislation by Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., to raise the wage floor to $3.75 in
January, $4.15 in 1990 and $4.55 in 1991.
   ``It's only clear that there is a deliberate attempt to stall
action on this bill,'' said Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd,
D-W.Va., who called the Republican tactics a filibuster.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that raising the
minimuand a scarlet macaw. The parrots
can be bought cheaply abroad and sold for $1,500 to $3,000 each in
the United States.
   The defendants, Carlos Fernandez, 27, Jose Flores, 24, Felix
Valdes, 39, Nancy Lopez, 50, and Rigoberto Cherta Garcia, 42, are
Cuban nationals who live in Miami with legal alien status.
   ``The government will show that these birds are endangered
species, that the defendants knew,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney
Daniel Gelber. ``These birds are worth hundreds of thousands of
dollars _ figure approaching a quarter of a million dollars.''
   Defense attorney Ellis Rubin said the government's case is
really ``for the birds.''
   Rubin told the jury that the government would seek to prove
``solely by circumstantial evidence'' that the birds came from
Cuba. The attorney said the defendants are breeders who were only
moving the birds from Miami to Marathon in the Florida Keys when
they were arrested.
   The U.S. Coast Guard received a distress signal from a boat in
the Florida Straits on April 3, which led to the discovery of a
boat at Matecumbe Key with the birds aboard.
   U.S. Customs Service agents said correspondence on the ship,
including a letter from a woman asking to buy ``a girdle, size
medium, that I need very much to go out,'' showed the boat had been
in Cuba. They also found Cuban coins, a bill from a hotel and
souvenirs of Cuba.
   Each defendant is charged with three felony counts, one of
conspiracy to violate the Lacy Act and two counts each of violation
of the act itself. If convicted, they face a maximum five-year
prison term and a $250,000 fine.
   The Lacy Act controls the interstate transportation of rare and
endangered species.
   Special Agent Jennifer English of the U.S. Fisheries and
Wildlife Service said the birds are being housed at Metro Zoo in
southern Dade County.
   Gelber and Assistant U.S. Attorney Allan Kaiser said the
government would seek forfeiture of the birds in a separate civil
action. If forfeited, the birds would be used for propagation
purposes, Ms. English said.

<HEAD>British War Babies Search for American Fathers and Their Pasts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Born out of wedlock to a U.S. GI and a Welsh woman
during World War II, Shirley McGlade for years knew only her
father's name and one clue _ as a small boy, he had lived in Idaho.
   As a teen-ager, she would visit Stratford on Avon, Shakespeare's
birthplace, on the infinitesimal chance that some American tourist
might mention her dad.
   She wrote to U.S. senators, government officials and President
Reagan, and after 14 years of searching, she found him in
California.
   Mrs. McGlade now helps others less lucky, heading one of two
British groups that help hundreds of ``war babies'' look for their
roots.
   Often equipped with little information, they face tight privacy
laws, intransigent bureaucracies and the lingering stigma of
illegitimacy. Some give up; most say they cannot.
   ``You're always told, `For God's sake don't tell anybody your
father was an American,''' said Mrs. McGlade, 43, whose father left
England not knowing her mother was pregnant. ``I kept it quiet for
my mum's sake.''
   But after she founded War Babes, she says she got hundreds of
phone calls from people saying, ``I'm the same as you. I'm
looking.'' The group now has 300 members.
   The Birmirk.''
   Well, that's not the only reason.
   ``I wanted to go to Florida so my son could play golf down
there,'' she adds. ``Those were the major points. However, I love
eccentric character roles, and they don't come around very often.
Fortunately, I have finally reached an age (51) when I can do them
and not worry about any of that (glamour) stuff anymore.''
   Brennan plays the mean superintendent of an orphanage in ``The
New Adventures of Pippi Longstockings,'' based on the popular
children's stories. ``I love meanies, and this goes back to Capt.
Lewis in `Private Benjamin.' You know why? Because they have no
sense of humor. People who are mean or unkind or rigid _ think
about it_ cannot laugh at themselves. If we can't laugh at
ourselves and the human condition, we're going to be mean.''
   Amazingly, Brennan can laugh, this despite a 1982 auto accident
that broke both her legs and made her face look like, in her former
husband's words, ``E.T. on a pillow.'' Months and months of plastic
surgery followed, along with two sessions in the Betty Ford Center
because of her addiction to painkillers.
   The recovery lasted four years, and now her face shows no
evidence of the ordeal. Nor does her spirit, even though she has
also undergone a masectomy. Her humor remains wickedly offbeat, but
she also speaks about serious matters, too. Such as her work for
Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD).
   The Los Angeles-born Brennan, was educated in convent schools,
then studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York.
Her first Broadway show, ``Little Mary Sunshine,'' lasted two
years, then she toured in ``The Miracle Worker'' for two years.
   She was a member of the original company of ``Hello, Dolly''
when producer Norman Lear spotted her and cast her for a comedic
role in his film ``Divorce, American Style.'' She followed with a
series of eccentric characters in ``The Cheap Detective,'' ``The
Sting,'' ``Murder by Death,'' ``Scarecrow,'' ``At Long Last Love''
and ``The Last Picture Show.''
   Brennan recently came to Los Angeles from her Ojai horse ranch
to make spot announcements for MADD's Drive for Life Day on Sept.
3, ``which happens to be my birthday.''
   Her feelings about drunken driving stem only partly from her
accident.
   ``Four years before, I had stopped drinking; I went to A.A.
(Alcoholics Anonymous),'' she said. ``Goldie (Hawn, her close
friend and `Private Benjamin' co-star) and I hadn't had anything to
drink over dinner. (The driver who hit her on a badly lighted
street) hadn't had anything to drink.''
   Having experienced what can happen on the streets even to sober
people, Brennan feels strongly about those who drive under the
influence. Two recent films infuriated her.
   ``I never would have seen `License to Drive' except that my dear
friend Carol Kane is in it,'' she said. ``My sons and I just sat
there stunned by the lack of conscience that would propel people to
do this. Why?
   ``We walked out after my friend Harvey Miller, one of the
writers of `Private Benjamin,' did a drunken driving scene, singing
wonderful old Frank Sinatra songs. People were laughing, they
thought it was so funny. I looked at my sons and we stood up and
walked out.
   ``I haven't seen `Arthur 2 On the Rocks.' I was offered the part
of a social worker, and I really wanted to work with Dudley Moore.
I read the script, in which (Moore and Liza Minnelli) wanted to
adopt a baby, and the social worker was all for it.
   ``I said to the producers, `People's consciousnesses are raised
now. Do you think you're going to get away with this? No woman
worth her salt would give a child or encourage a couple to adopt a
baby if there is alcoholism in the family. I'm an adult child of
alcholics, so I know what I'm talking about.'
   ``I had to walk away from that job. And I could have used that
money, too.''

<HEAD>Mainline Faiths Launch First Ecumenical TV Network</HEAD>

   Standing in front of a big, circular barn near
Hancock, Mass., the Rev. Bill Turpee described how the Shakers, a
small, close-knit Christian community, considered round barns more
efficient in farming.
   ``The efficiency of the Shaker barn meant that there would be
more time to worship and serve God,'' said Turpee, an American
Baptist minister from Boston, in the opening scene on a new
interfaith cable TV network, VISN.
   Vision Interfaith Satellite Network started operations Monday,
the country's first broadly ecumenical network involving a wide
spectrum of U.S. religious traditions.
   To begin each day of broadcasts, network co-host Turpee, or a
woman colleague still to be named, will offer a short description
of some religious group that has made an impact on American life.
   The network's initial fare also represented a combination that
planners say will be standard _ music, dramas with ethical points,
call-in talk shows, documentaries and magazine-type exploration of
issues.
   ``We're providing programs of a morals-faith kind that has been
at the core of our country's whole value system, but which largely
has not been on national television,'' said the Rev. Wilford V.
Bane Jr.
   Bane, a United Methodist and the network's interim general
manager, said, ``It's going to broaden the perspective and give a
more rounded picture of what religious life is all about.''
   Even ``for viewers without strong religious convictions,'' he
said, it will provide ``entertaining and throught-provoking
alternatives to ordinary television.''
   With 10 major multisystem cable companies under agreement with
the network, it has a potential of reaching 18.5 million
households, but initially was estimated available to only about 6
million households.
   This was expected to grow toward the higher mark, and beyond, as
local systems adjust channel assignments.
   Start-up financing has come through the cable industry, whose
fees are expected to cover the central operational budget of about
$6 million annually. Denominations initially are footing most
production costs, however foundation gifts and commercial
advertising are expected once the number of subscribers is
determined.
   The new network has rules against any soliciting of money or
proselytizing.
   Launching of the network came at a time many cable systems were
seeking replacements for programs of scandal-tainted televangelists
such as Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart.
   The Rev. Daniel Matthews, an Episcopalian and board chairman of
the network, said most religious television lately has emphasized
``personal pietism exclusively slanted toward a narrow
perspective.''
   It ``gave a distorted image of American religious life,'' he
said.
   Matthews, rector of Manhattan's richly endowed Trinity Church
where the new network has offices, said it will reflect historic
faiths that have been ``the backbone of America.''
   Besides mainstream Protestant, Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox
and Jewish bodies the network also involves such groups as the
Mennonites, Salvation Army, Seveneth-day Adventists and Mormons.
   ``For the first time we have an example on television of the way
religion ought to work in a democracy, with tolerance and
respect,'' said George W. Baskin, the network's director of faith
group relations.
   Although Catholic bishops decided against using the network,
participation was voted by the Association of Catholic Radio and
Television Syndicators, including church orders and institutions
active in TV production.
   Richard P. Lindsay, communications officer for the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), said VISN will offer
``top-quality, values-oriented programming,'' appealing to a
``broad spectrum of viewers.''
   The network's program director, Jeff Weber, a Presbyterian,
corralled a varied composite for opening week, ranging from dramas
produced by Seventh-day Adventists to magazine shows produced by
Roman Catholics and Lutherans.
   At the outset, broadcast schedules were limited to five hours on
weekdays, 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. (EDT), and longer on weekends, from 7
a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturdays, and 6 a. m. to 5 p.m. Sundays.
   Children's shows have a big place only on Saturdays, along with
weekend Bible study shows, dramas and worship.
   The network expected to expand to a 12-hour daily schedule by
the first of the year, including prime evening time.
   The Rev. Bruno Caliandro, a United Methodist and the network's
director of program development, predicted the network will be
reaching 30 million households within two years.
   Besides denominationally produced programs, he said the network
acquires programs from other producers, and also will produce
programs itself, with some now in planning stages with various
academic institutions, including:
   Programs on biomedical issues with the Chicago Medical Center,
on world religions with Harvard, on everyday ethical problems faced
by Americans with Boston University, and on interdisciplinary
viewpoints with Notre Dame.

   Drawn from Newsweek coverage of the case and further reporting,
senior editor Larry Martz says Falwell, who temporarily headed the
network for the scandal-bumped Bakker, apparently had miscounted on
these possibilites:
   ``At one extreme he (Falwell) might win kudos for statesmanship
in rescuing a troubled ministry and easing the corrupt Bakker out
of power; at the other he might come away with control of the
entire empire.''
   Falwell has insisted he never wanted it.

   Religious organizations often fail people at
the most critical times, especially during their midlife
re-examination of values, according to a major national study.
   ``There's an unstated norm in a lot of church communities that
you don't talk about faith, like politics and sex,'' said Connie
Leean, one of the authors of the study sponsored by 23 religious
organizations.
   ``It's a fearful thing to do because many people have the notion
that different experiences of faith may not fit easily into a dogma
or confessions of the church,'' said Leean, a Lutheran educator.
   The six-year study, ``Faith Development in the Adult Life
Cycle,'' combines poll data from the Gallup organization and
in-depth interviews with more than 1,000 people nationwide.
Directed by the Rev. Kenneth Stokes, the study is for church
organizations to help adults through midlife faith crises.

<HEAD>Export Labor a Main Source of Foreign Currency for Philippines</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   With jobs scarce at home, so many
Filipinos have gone to work abroad that they have become one of
their country's main sources of foreign currency and a key factor
in keeping the economy going.
   Hundreds of thousands leave each year and many of them are
trained workers who take jobs far below their capabilities because
of the higher pay abroad.
   Teachers, for example, work as maids overseas because the wages
are much higher than a teacher's salary at home.
   Even so, President Corazon Aquino calls these export workers the
Philippines ``new heroes.''
   The estimated 1.5 million to 2.5 million overseas contract
workers remain a steady source of income for the country's
faltering economy.
   Overseas workers sent home $791.9 million in 1987, making them
the country's third largest source of foreign exchange after
exports of electronic components and garments. Central Bank figures
indicate that foreign-worker remittances for the first half of 1988
totaled $419.3 million.
   The money doesn't go directly to the Philippines government but
the government benefits by its flowing into the economy.
   In general, the workers send some of their foreign wages home to
their families. The families exchange the foreign currencies at
banks or other financial houses for Philippines pesos. The foreign
currencies then circulate through the Philippines financial system.
The currencies might be purchased by a Philippines importer, for
example, to buy foreign goods or by the government to pay off part
of the nation's foreign debt.
   Tomas Achacoso, director of the Philippine Overseas Employment
Administration (POEA), says 450,000 workers with contracts approved
by his agency left for work abroad last year.
   That does not include uncounted thousands who leave without
seeking help from the POEA. Those with POEA approved contracts
included 60,000 maids, some of whom left skilled professions in the
Philippines to work as domestics abroad.
   Achacoso said the exodus has left shortages in some key skills
at home. Shipping companies, for example, say they have problems
finding skippers for ferry boats in the Philippines archipelago as
well as crews for domestic oil and chemical tankers.
   Nurses are also in short supply, ``and pretty soon, we might
have a shortage of computer experts or programmers,'' Achacoso said.
   But Achacoso denies there has been a ``brain drain,'' and he
said the foreign exchange earnings outweigh the disadvantages are.
   ``You can't speak of a brain drain because most of these people
do not have jobs here,'' he said. ``Those who were employed here
and left, simply opened up positions for the unemployed here.''
   President Aquino told Filipino maids in Hong Kong last April
that overseas workers helped reduce the unemployment rate to about
9 percent and if they had remained at home, ``you could have been
part of that statistic.''
   The worker exodus began in the mid-1970's when Persian Gulf oil
countries hired thousands of foreigners to build roads, office
buildings, hotels and homes and to manage new development projects.
   Even though the oil boom has faded, the Middle East remains the
major destination of Filipino workers. Saudi Arabia alone employs
at least 300,000 of them as nurses, office clerks, public transport
drivers, janitors and as private servants.
   Families of overseas workers often are the only ones with money
to build homes or buy new appliances in rural areas.
   But overseas workers sometimes suffer abuses.
   ``The problems are with those who go there as tourists,'' he
said. ``The moment their visas expire, they are open to a lot of
abuses, and they can range from rape to being forced into
prostitution, non-payment of salaries and being beaten up.''
   Ernesto Catequista, a 31-year-old accountant, recently applied
for a job abroad with POEA.
   ``I'd like office work _ clerical, bookkeeping, anything,'' he
told The Associated Press. He added that he had earned 2,500 pesos
($125) a month at a local bank until it closed in 1985. He has
since been earning about the same amount selling encyclopedias
because he cannot find a steady job.
   Josefina Pahilga, 38, who trained as a teacher, took a job as a
maid abroad after she could not find a teaching post and ended up
earning 2,000 pesos ($100) a month rolling cigarettes in a tobacco
factory.
   As a maid in Western Europe, she earns the equivalent of $450 a
month plus free board and lodging and has seen much of the world.
Before coming home on for a six-month leave, she joined her German
employer on a family ski vacation in Bulgaria.
   Others cite reasons beyond economics for working abroad.
   ``It's always the money _ and going to the United States,'' said
a former X-ray technician who works as a maid in Cairo, Egypt.
``They always think it will be easier to get to the United States
from (other countries) than from the Philippines.''

<HEAD>More `Hang-the-Expense' Cars in 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European automakers must think this is the
year for you to take the plunge on that sports car with enough
horsepower to achieve Earth orbit or on the luxury barge with
faucets for red and white wine in the back seat.
   They're offering more models than ever before, 40, that get
caught by the U.S. ``gas-guzzler'' excise tax, according to the
annual fuel economy ratings released by the Environmental
Protection Agency on Thursday for 1989 models.
   Five cars bearing U.S. names are also taxed. Two of them are
largely made in Europe and are aimed at the same hang-the-expense
market segment that the Europeans are going after. The other three
are the only entirely U.S. models ever to pay the tax, which they
also paid in 1987 but escaped last year.
   As usual, the Japanese are the mileage champs. For the fourth
straight year the fuel-stingiest cars are the Japanese-made Geo
Metro, formerly the Chevrolet Sprint, and the two-seater Honda
Civic CRX HF.
   The Metro's mileage was 53 miles per gallon in the city, 1 mpg
below last year's figure for the same car, and 58 on the highway
test, the same as last year. Geo is the new nameplate General
Motors Corp. is putting on the imports of its Chevrolet division.
   The Civic's figures are identical to last year's: 50 mpg city,
56 mpg highway.
   The gas-guzzler tax, unique to the United States, assesses a
penalty in the form of an excise that rises with declining fuel
economy. It starts at $500 and goes up to $3,850. It was enacted in
1975, when fears of fuel shortages were rampant, and aimed at
discouraging the unthrifty.
   In all, 45 models _ some of them identical except for trim _ are
official gas-guzzlers. Last year's list included only 24, and the
year before that the count was only 18.
   This year's includes five Rolls-Royces that escaped in previous
years through a now-closed loophole that exempted cars of more than
6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight.
   European models that will pay the tax come from Rolls and its
Bentley badge, plus Maserati, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche,
Aston-Martin, Jaguar, Volvo and BMW.
   The proliferation of guzzlers reflects a growing desire for
performance and status, analysts say.
   ``Around here it's almost a status symbol to have paid a $3,000
penalty tax,'' commented Garrett Stasse, auto editor of The
Register in Shrewsbury, N.J., in affluent Monmouth County.
   ``If you have a car in your lineup that does not live up to its
performance image, you're in more trouble today than if you have an
official gas-guzzler,'' said Ed Miller, a senior editor at Ward's
Automotive Publications in Detroit.
   Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety in
Washington, an advocacy group that frequently has opposed
relaxation of government fuel standards, said: ``We are going in
the wrong direction. We ought to be headed the other way and making
gas-sippers.''
   But manufacturers, he said, ``think they'll make more in profits
than they pay in penalties.''
   ``The tax really isn't objected to by the buyer'' of luxury
cars, said Kyle Johnson of GM's Cadillac division. ``It does not
alter GM's commitment to stay away from the gas-guzzler tax on
U.S.-built cars.''
   Johnson was commenting on the Cadillac Allante, a $50,000-plus
two-seater introduced last year to compete against the upscale
Europeans. A larger engine this year brought it under the tax with
a rating of 15 mpg in the city and 23 mpg on the highway, adding
$650 to the sticker price.
   The other taxed U.S. entry is one model of the Chrysler TC by
Maserati, which had readings of 17 and 21. Other TC models escape
the tax, but not the one with the turbocharged 2.5-liter engine
(152 cubic inches) without the top-gear lockup feature on the
three-speed automatic.
   This car is built in Italy using many U.S.-supplied components.
The Cadillac Allante is built in the United States using an Italian
body.
   The other U.S. gas-guzzlers are the Chrysler Fifth Avenue and
its identical twins, the Dodge Diplomat and the Plymouth Grand
Fury. They get 16 mpg in the city and 23 mpg out of town, according
to EPA, compared with 17-23 last year and 16-21 in 1987.
   Repeat tests of the same car can yield slightly differing
results. ``The car has not changed,'' said Tony Cervone, a Chrysler
spokesman.
   The Fifth Avenue family is in its last year. Successors were
introduced last year: the Chrysler New Yorker and Dodge Dynasty,
rated at 18 mpg city and 26 mpg highway for 1989.
   In all, Japanese and Korean manufacturers captured the top 10
spots, as they did last year. Because Japanese-owned plants in the
United States and in Japan have in the past supplied the same cars
to the U.S. market simultaneously, EPA no longer lists the top
domestic models. But the top U.S.-manufactured car from a Big Three
company appears to be a Ford Escort recorded at 32-42.
   The biggest guzzlers this year are four Aston-Martin sports cars
new to the United States, all 8-11 and carrying the top penalty of
$3,850.

<HEAD>Nobody Should Be Watching `Bodywatching'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS might as well come on the air Saturday night
and announce, ``Hey, Bonehead! The Olympics are on NBC! Why aren't
you watching!?''
   Instead, the network offers a remarkably lame study in the
obvious, ``Bodywatching,'' based on the Desmond Morris books on
body language.
   Did we know that the facial expression for joy is the same in
every culture _ a smile? Did we know that hands express emotion?
Did we know that hello is good-bye reversed?
   OF COURSE, WE DID! WE'RE NOT STUPID! GET TO THE SEX!
   The special actually reveals _ stop the presses _ how men's
bodies are different than women's. But this is network television,
so don't expect to see the good parts.
   ``Bodywatching'' starts off by examining the body language of
door-to-door salesmen. Rap pleasantly on the door, one vacuum
merchant suggests to another. Talk your way in the door. Make the
vacuum cleaner look easy to use.
   This is scientific?
   Eventually, ``Bodywatching'' slinks up to the subject it
constantly suggests, first with a woman who designs brassieres. She
says her job is not unlike designing a suspension bridge. ``You
have to somehow get the bust up!'' ``Push-up bras create curves
that are highly sexual!'' gushes narrator Burgess Meredith, whose
body language is thankfully unseen.
   On to a beach in Brazil _ hairy chests, string bikinis. ``Simply
put, it's really about mating!'' Meredith squeals.
   For some reason, much of the first half of the special is taken
up with following a blind sculptor to Italy where he gets to feel
Michelangelo's masterpiece, ``David.'' This is rather, er,
touching, but it doesn't seem to have much to do with body
language. ``Remember, Michael is blind!'' Meredith exclaims
irritatingly several minutes into the piece. Apparently the writers
think the viewers are, too.
   The best body language for ``Bodywatching'' is turning the
channel.

   If these are really the best young comedians of today, standup
comedy is doomed.
   HBO has scraped together a ``Twelfth Annual Young Comedians
Show,'' airing Sunday and Sept. 30. Past installments boast a
number of finds: Robin Williams, Jay Leno, Steve Martin, Paul
Reubens (Pee-wee Herman), Steven Wright and Louie Anderson, among
them.
   This time around, even host Paul Rodriguez isn't in particularly
fine form. The only standout of the five comics he introduces is
the closing act, Richard Jeni, and he isn't particularly special.
His bit about fighting in New York is pretty funny _ it takes 40
minutes to actually work up to violence, after various stages, such
as determining the opponent has a problem, as in, ``You got a
problem? Hey, what's your problem, man?''
   Cathy Radman trots out an old bit about crossing the Canadian
border for a gig only to get into a confused argument with a border
guard who thinks she said ``Canadian'' instead of ``comedian.'' If
Radman doesn't get some new material, there'll be no such problem.
   Paul Dillery has some decent material and a unique style. With
his baby face and slight figure, he says he once tried to get a job
in construction. ``The foreman looked at me and said, `You can have
the job. Just fill this out.' He handed me a shirt.''
   Rick Reynolds' litany of unhappy material _ he makes fun of a
grandfather with facial paralysis, for pity's sake _ eventually
sinks to dumb sex jokes interrupted line by line with his operatic
singing.
   Haywood Banks is embarrassingly desperate to cram his mish-mash
of material into a cohesive gimmick, so he dresses inexplicably
like a nerd. He pushes far beyond its potential one bit in which he
holds up a sign that says, ``This.'' ``Did you see this? Look at
this! What's this doing on the floor?'' He follows up with
``That,'' ``Something'' and ``Nothing.''
   Perhaps HBO should consider doing a young comedians show every
other year. Or every five years. Or ``as warranted.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   LAUGH ABOUT IT WHEN YOU'VE GOT TO CHOOSE _ A bunch of top-notch
comedians are getting together for an ABC special on Oct. 15 that
will endeavor to kid citizens into exercising their right to vote.
The two-hour special, ``An All-Star Celebration: The '88 Vote,''
stars Billy Crystal, Lily Tomlin, Robin Williams, Roseanne Barr,
George Carlin, Whoopi Goldberg, Martin Mull and Jerry Seinfeld,
plus singer-songwriter Stevie Wonder, actor Lou Diamond Phillips
and musical group Cheap Trick. The special is being taped before a
live audience on the UCLA campus Oct. 10-11. ...
   A FINE ... OOPS _ Anthony Andrews has dropped out of the
upcoming ABC series ``A Fine Romance.'' Instead, another British
actor, Christopher Cazenove, formerly of ``Dynasty,'' will star
opposite Margaret Whitton in the screwball comedy filmed in Europe
about a married couple _ he English, she American _ who are
divorced but continue as co-hosts of a television series that takes
them to exotic locales and gets them involved in all sorts of
scrapes. The series has been delayed until mid-season because of
the Writers Guild strike this summer.

   In the tumultuous days of China's cultural
revolution, Grace King was exiled to the provinces to work on a
farm. Today, her income is in the ``six figures'' and she owns an
apartment on Manhattan's fashionable East Side.
   Not surprisingly, she has no plans to return to her homeland.
   ``Going back would close off all our possibilities,'' Ms. King
said. ``It would be too much of a sacrifice.''
   Still, Ms. King remains a citizen of China, one of a growing
number of Chinese who have chosen to seek their fortunes in
American businesses and at American universities.
   Sons and daughters of high-ranking Communist Party members, and
even party members themselves, the Chinese came as students, part
of Deng Xiaoping's program of modernization.
   Some are taking jobs to round out their American education,
gaining practical experience that will better enable them to
contribute to China's development once they return home. Others
have become enamored of the United States and have decided to
settle here.
   The largest group af all, however, don't know where they will
end up, torn as they are between appreciation of American freedom
and ties to their homeland.
   Ms. King, 32, arrived in America nine years ago from Beijing.
After graduating from Columbia University with a master's degree in
business administration in 1984, she took a job with Merrill Lynch
as an investment banker.
   Ms. King, the daughter of two high-ranking Communist Party
members, saw her family ripped apart by the ultra-leftist Cultural
Revolution of 1966-1976. Her well-educated parents were purged from
the party, lost their jobs and were kicked from their apartment.
   As part of Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung's program that forced
intellectuals to do physical labor, Ms. King herself was sent to
the countryside to farm. During those years, she spent much of her
spare time in political meetings, hearing harangues against the
capitalism and imperialism of China's then-enemy No. 1, the United
States.
   But then came a rapprochement between the United States and
China, and educational opportunities in America. Ms. King jumped at
her chance.
   ``I'm really happy that I came,'' she said in a recent
interview. ``It gave me a chance to see a different world.''
   Like many of her countrymen who've decided to stay, Ms. King
says she's here for her career.
   ``In China, advancement still doesn't depend so much on talent
and results,'' she said. ``There are other things, like your
attitude, and your political ideology. I can't tolerate that.''
   Leo Orleans, a China scholar at the Library of Congress who is
writing a book on Chinese students in the United States, estimates
that at least 22,000 of the 62,000 who have come here as students
since 1979 have decided to stay.
   That fact, he believes, prompted Beijing to consider slashing
drastically the number of Chinese students allowed in the United
States. Official Chinese documents seen in New York in March
indicated that China has debated cutting the number from around
18,000 in 1987 to 600. But those plans, it appears, have not been
put into place.
   Jerome Cohen, an expert on the Chinese legal system and
modernization drive, sees the mainland Chinese generation in
America as crucial to the country's modernization _ regardless of
whether they return.
   ``These people will help their country no matter where they
are,'' he said. ``It's difficult for a Westerner to understand the
depths of their patriotism.''
   In addition, he said, ``it's vital that the Chinese have people
who know the practice as well as the theory'' _ and that is not
only true in business.
   Hu Quing, a 27-year-old postdoctoral fellow in physics at the
University of California, Berkeley, says the kind of experience
he's getting would be unattainable in China.
   ``Experimental physics requires a lot of equipment and supplies,
and China just doesn't have the resources,'' said Hu. ``Certainly
if I go back I will disappear from the world of academia.''
   Ms. King and Hu say that even if they did return, China, a poor
country with 1 billion people, wouldn't be able to use their skills.
   Liu Ting's father, former Chinese Premier Liu Shaoqi, was the
main target of the Cultural Revolution and died imprisoned and
alone in a hospital in western China in 1969.
   Ms. Liu, 36, came to this country eight years ago and in 1984
became the first woman since Communist China was founded in 1949 to
graduate from Harvard Business School.
   ``The Chinese leaders say they want us to give our lives to help
the country grow,'' said Ms. Liu, 36, who works for Rockefeller
Associates. ``But haven't we given enough? I can see compromising
to help one's country, but never sacrifice.''
   Ms. Liu says she plans on settling here. ``But I may change,''
she said. ``If China continues to open to the West, I may go back.''
   Orleans predicts that in the future, more Chinese will try to
stay.
   ``First, the Chinese are just beginning to realize that America
doesn't just throw people out of the country if they are here
legally,'' he said. ``Even though their government is calling them
back, the students are beginning to understand that they can stay
anyway.''
   The politcal crackdown and official warnings that followed a
recent series of student protests calling for more democracy in
China make America ``look that much better,'' he said.
   Still, some students plan to return, among them Mei Shan, an
analyst with Kissinger Associates with degrees from Harvard Law
School and Columbia's School of International Affairs.
   ``My generation is THE generation that can change China,'' said
Mei, 40, who spent eight years in Inner Mongolia during the
Cultural Revolution repairing farm machinery and now does
geo-political risk analysis for the consulting firm.
   ``We are the only ones who know the country and have expertise.
The younger ones, they may have more desire for democracy or fancy
things, but they don't really have the driving force. They didn't
experience the Cultural Revolution so they have little
understanding of bitterness. For me, the bitterness has been my
strength.''
   Mei acknowledges he is taking a chance in going back to China.
   ``Sure I might not be able to do what I want to do,'' he said.
``But not being in China, even now, I somehow feel guilty.''

   Consumer prices rose at a 5.2 percent annual
rate in August as a result of higher food, shelter and gasoline
prices, the government reports.
   Food and beverage prices rose 0.5 percent for the month,
compared with 0.9 percent in July, when the Labor Department said
the greatest impact of the dry weather in the Farm Belt began
reaching consumer pocketbooks.
   But gasoline prices jumped a whopping 3 percent in August, the

the year.
   Personal income grew 0.2 percent, while personal consumption

   The suit filed Tuesday in Delaware seeks to prohibit Burbank,
Calif.-based Shamrock from acquiring any more shares of Polaroid
stock or attempting another tender offer and asks that the company
divest itself of Polaroid stock it now owns.
   The suit was filed after Polaroid urged its stockholders to
reject as inadequate a sweetened takeover bid by Shamrock that

protection to avoid having to post a $225 million bond required for
appealing a federal jury verdict against them.
   A Hunt spokesman said Wednesday the brothers decided to seek
Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy protection from creditors to keep
Minpeco SA, which won the verdict against them, from beginning
foreclosure proceedings on their personal assets until the appeal
could be made.
   The jury on Aug. 20 in New York ordered the two Hunts and
brother Lamar Hunt to pay more than $130 million in damages for
conspiring to corner the world's silver market in the late 1970s,
ruining the investments of Minpeco.

<HEAD>Inflation Stays At 5.2 Percent In August, Government Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   Higher rents and gasoline prices largely replaced food as the
sharpest spurs to higher prices that kept inflation at an
annualized rate of 5.2 percent during August, the government said.
   Separate goverment reports also released Wednesday showed a
modest rise in personal income and a drop in housing construction.
The news had little impact on the financial markets, where stocks,
bonds, oil prices and the dollar were little changed.
   Trading was more dramatic in precious metals. Gold prices
tumbled below the $400-a-troy-ounce level in the United States for
the first time since early last year. On the Commodity Exchange in
New York, gold for current delivery fell $6.90 a troy ounce to
close at $398.40, the first time the metal closed below $400 since
Feb. 18, 1987, when it fetched $392.70.
   Analysts have attributed the recently depressed gold market to
growing investor disillusionment with bullion as a hedge against
inflation.
   In its report on inflation, the Labor Department said food and
beverage prices rose 0.5 percent in August as the effects of the
drought in the Farm Belt began to ease. Prices jumped 0.9 percent
in July when the greatest impact of the dry weather began hitting
consumer pocketbooks.
   But gasoline prices jumped a whopping 3 percent in August, the
biggest increase in 12 months, and despite lower utility bills and
home energy costs, shelter expenses rose 0.6 percent in August,
their largest increase in seven months.
   But analysts agreed there was nothing alarming in the numbers.
   ``The scare that we're off to the races or that an inflationary
sprial is under way has not materialized and it won't
materialize,'' said Larry Chimerine of the WEFA Group, a Bala
Cynwyd, Pa., consulting firm.
   Separately, the Commerce Department said personal income rose a
modest 0.2 percent in August, the smallest gain in eight months,
although much of it represented declines in both farm subsidies and
farm income. Wages and salaries were up just 0.3 percent.
   After adjustments for inflation, the government said, Americans'
average weekly earnings fell 1.3 percent in August. The decline in
workers' buying power was the third in the past four months and the
worst since the government began keeping tabs on real earnings in
1964.
   The decrease stemmed from a 0.9 percent drop in the average
number of hours worked, from 34.9 hours to 34.6 hours, and the 0.4
percent hike in consumer prices. Average hourly earnings were
$9.24, unchanged from July.
   Another Commerce Department report showed housing construction
fell 3.3 percent last month, with a steep drop in new apartments
outweighing a small gain in single-family home building. For the
first eight months of this year, housing starts are running 9.9
percent below the same period in 1987.

   The oil futures market remains cautious in
advance of next week's meeting of the OPEC price monitoring
committee, analysts say.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, settled
19 cents higher at $14.56 a barrel Wednesday. Tuesday was the last
day of the crude contract for October delivery. Other contract
month were mixed at the close.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery gained 0.92
cent to close at 45.35 cents a gallon, while other contract months
also closed higher.
   The October wholesale heating oil contract lost 0.23 cent to
settle at 41.09 cents a gallon. Other heating oil contracts settled
mixed on the day.
   Skepticism about the outcome of the upcoming meeting of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' pricing committee
has made traders relucant to sell, analysts said. The meeting is
scheduled for Sunday and Monday.
   ``This is a market that sees considerable storm clouds on the
horizon,'' said Stephen Smith, a research analyst with Bear,
Stearns & Co. ``Crude prices are holding up probably because
there's some chance that OPEC can pull a rabbit out of the hat.''
   There is speculation that such a meeting could lead to a
gathering of all 13 OPEC members and a possible reduction in the
cartel's oil output. Recent reports have suggested that several
OPEC countries are producing far above their assigned quotas,
helping to flood world markets with oil and keeping prices weak.
   Nevertheless, near-month contracts for crude oil and gasoline
continued to gain strength from falling inventories in the face of
strong demand. Oil brokers said demand is up nearly 2 percent from
last year.
   The American Petroleum Institute reported Tuesday that U.S.
crude oil stocks were down by 6.212 million barrels in the week
ended Sept. 16, while gasoline stocks fell by 2.58 million barrels.
   Analysts said the fall in gasoline inventories stemmed from last
week's hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico and the temporary shutdown
of several refineries in the area.

<HEAD>Third World Governments Seek More Aid At World Bank-IMF Meeting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Representatives of 24 Third World governments get
together today to discuss ways to win more help from richer
countries, as formal sessions begin for the joint annual meeting of
the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
   Informal meetings have been going on all week during the arrival
of delegates from the 151 member governments, as well as
representatives of banks and industrial companies.
   At the top of most governments' concerns is the burden of
interest payments on developing countries' debt, due to reach $1.2
billion by the end of this year.
   In New York the biggest debtor _ Brazil, which owes about $120
billion _ is to sign a new $82 billion agreement with its creditor
banks, including $5.2 billion in new loans to help the nation cover
its obligations for 1987, 1988 and the first half of next year.
Brazil suspended interest payments on its debt in February 1987,
but officially ended the moratorium on Wednesday.
   But new money lent by banks goes largely to pay interest on old
debt. Third World governments will ask wealthier governments, and
the bank and fund, to increase their lending.
   Later in the week, the wealthier countries will meet on their
own problems as well as those of the Third World. The most
important session will be by the ``Group of Seven,'' comprising the
United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Canada and
Italy.
   The Third World debt problem has been getting much vocal
sympathy in Berlin. A ``Counter-Congress'' consisting of critics of
the World Bank and IMF also opens on Thursday.
   On Wednesday, former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt
appealed for debt reductions for developing nations. With President
Reagan's administration taking the lead, the World Bank and IMF
have resisted such pleas as counterproductive. The United States
has the largest share of voting strength in both entities.
   Critics of the IMF and World Bank say the need to make interest
payments, and conditions set by the fund and bank for new loans,
compel governments to raise prices and to reduce wages. Fund and
bank officials argue that such policies are needed to prevent worse
suffering, and to put the debtor countries into better position to
borrow again.
   Mobilizing criticism here has been the left-wing Green party,
whichhas representatives in the Berlin legislature and the West
German parliament.
   The group, which says it disapproves of violence as a political
method, plans a mass demonstration in Berlin on Sunday, when it
hopes to bring 40,000 protesters into the streets.
   The Greens also have taken the lead in organizing a ``Permanent
Peoples' Tribunal'' to meet Monday and accuse the bank and fund of
damaging the environment and violating the United Nations charter.
   Spokesmen for the IMF and World Bank say they will furnish
information to the organizers but will not send representatives to
appear at the four-day session.

<HEAD>Buick Introduces '89s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Buick says its 1989 line further splits
a perception of a few years ago that it was difficult to tell the
automobiles from Oldsmobiles or other General Motors Corp. cars.
   ``When you looked at the (Buick and Oldsmobile) cars on the road
a year or two ago, there wasn't much difference,'' Buick General
Manager Ed Mertz said Wednesday. ``But they're going one way and
we're going another.''
   Buick introduced its new lineup of cars for the coming model
year on Wednesday, saying the decline in the GM division's sales
has ended.
   Oldsmobile, Cadillac and Chevrolet introduced their 1989
versions earlier this month.
   In the early 1980s, GM was criticized for making too many cars
that looked too much alike. But recently, including this month's
introductions of 1989 models, executives from each of GM's car
divisions have stressed the differences between their cars and
those of other divisions.
   Chevrolet has been seen as aiming its new cars, especially
through the new Geo line, at economy-conscious buyers, and
Oldsmobile is shifting its sights to a market that is younger and
more interested in high technology than the segment traditionally
associated with its cars.
   Mertz predicted at a news conference that Buick's sales in the
'89 model year would show slight gains from the previous model year.
   ``We have arrested the (sales) downturn,'' he said. ``November
was the low.''
   He speculated final figures for the model year due early next
month should show Buick held 5.7 percent of the market. That share,
Mertz said, should rise to 6 percent to 6.5 percent during the
coming year.
   Much of the sales gain is expected from the Riviera, a two-door
coupe being lengthened by 11 inches in 1989, mainly in the rear of
the car, to about 16{ feet.
   ``We see an 18,000 to 22,000 range in '89, about twice that of
the current year,'' Mertz said of Riviera sales.
   Buick's two-seater Reatta, with a base price of $26,700, will
return for 1989 after its introduction last January. Buick has sold
2,500 of the cars and production is quickening toward a 1989 goal
of 7,000 to 8,000, Mertz said.
   Reatta is the sixth-shortest but is one of the heaviest of
Buick's 16-car lineup, weighing in at 3,394 pounds. Only the
Riviera coupe and two full-size station wagons are heavier.
   Officials said Buick would continue its Skylark and Skyhawk
models, with base prices starting at $9,285, and ``We will have a
small but steady market in full-size wagons,'' Mertz said.
   In the middle of the model year, Buick will introduce its Park
Avenue Ultra, a luxury sedan with full leather interiors, multiple
seat adjustments and other features. No price has been set.

<HEAD>More Samurais Coming to United States</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Executives of American Suzuki Motor Corp. say the
company has recovered strongly since a private report in June
alleged that its Samurai utility vehicle was prone to flipping.
   ``I think the consumers are reassured,'' Suzuki spokesman James
Weber said at a news conference Wednesday to introduce the '89
Suzuki line of two utility vehicles and a car. ``Right now, we've
sucked the pipeline (for Samurais) dry...
   ``It just shows the consumer confidence in the vehicle,'' Weber
said of the rebound. ``I think we're stronger.''
   Weber predicted selling somewhere around 2,000 Samurais monthly
in the 1989 model year.
   Last June, Suzuki was stung by reports by Consumers Union,
publisher of Consumer Reports, that the Samurai was dangerously
prone to rolling over. The company denied the charges, but watched
its June sales plummet 63.8 percent, to 2,199 from 6,074 in May.
   But by August, aided by a major buyer incentives campaign, sales
had rebounded to 12,208 vehicles.
   This coming model year, the Samurai will be back in Suzuki's 200
dealers in 39 states, joined by two new models: the Swift
automobile and the Sidekick four-wheel-drive vehicle.
   The Swift, to be available in two models, is a companion for
Chevrolet's newly introduced Geo Metro, an economy-minded car built
by Suzuki in Japan. The Sidekick will be linked the Geo Tracker, a
four-wheel drive vehicle also built in Japan.
   In April, production of those Suzukis and Chevrolets will be
moved to Canada.
   Suzuki officials insisted Sidekick and Samurai sales should not
overlap.
   Sidekicks, they said, were aimed for an older market than were
Samurais, which are built a little more for off-road use _ a bit
shorter and narrower, but with more ground clearance than the
Sidekick.
   The Sidekick comes in a number of variations, depending on,
among other things, whether it's equipped with a 1.3- or 1.6-liter
engine and whether it has a cloth or hard top.
   Base price for the Samurai will be $8,495 and the Sidekick will
go for a base of $8,995. The Swift GLX has a base price of $7,495
and the GTi will retail for $8,995.
   Between now and April, Suzuki said, it hoped to sell 30,000
Sidekicks and 10,000 of both Swift models. Like the Samurai, the
Sidekick will be brought to the United States as a truck.

<HEAD>Mass. Bans Mandatory Arbitration Between Stockbrokers, Investors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The securities industry is expected to mount a
constitutional challenge to new Massachusetts regulations designed
to protect small investors by barring agreements that prevent
investors from suing their stockbrokers.
   Responding to a flood of investor complaints after last year's
stock market crash, Massachusetts today becomes the first state to
ban such agreements. The new regulations outlaw contracts that
require arbitration in disputes over losses.
   Securities industry officials say Massachusetts is treading on
thin constitutional ice in enacting the guidelines because the U.S.
Supreme Court last year upheld contracts that make arbitration
agreements a precondition for doing business.
   ``Any lender has preconditions on what terms they lend you
money,'' William J. Fitzpatrick, general counsel of the Securities
Industry Association, said Wednesday. ``It's not unreasonable to
say if we have a dispute we're not going to go through the very
expensive and inefficient method of litigation.''
   Fitzpatrick, who testified against the Massachusetts rule at a
July hearing, predicted securities industry groups would sue the
state over the mandatory arbitration ban.
   Officials said 16 other states are planning similar regulations.
Massachusetts' new rules, to be filed today by the secretary of
state's office, take effect Jan. 1, 1989.
   ``We're concerned about investors having a choice,'' said Deputy
Secretary of State Martin T. Meehan. ``We don't want them to be in
a position where they have no choice but to sign away their day in
court.''
   Most brokerage firms require customers to settle disputes
through an arbitration hearing sponsored by the New York Stock
Exchange, the National Association of Securities Dealers or other
market organizations.
   Arbitration is cheaper and faster than suing, but investors have
only a limited right to appeal. While big institutional investors
can negotiate contracts with brokerages, individual investors
usually have little choice but to agree, often unknowingly, to
arbitration.
   A Securities and Exchange Commission survey this year of 65
firms handling 90 percent of all customer accounts found virtually
all require arbitration, particularly for customers who borrow
money from the firm through margin accounts or trade in risky stock
options.
   Massachusetts officials said they have received hundreds of
complaints since the Oct. 19 market crash from disgruntled
investors who didn't realize they had waived their right to sue for
losses.
   The New York Stock Exchange said it received 1,175 arbitration
cases through August compared with 616 for the same period of 1987
and a total of 1,000 for all last year.
   Securities lawyers said mandatory arbitration agreements often
are buried in ``boilerplate gobbledygook'' of contracts in sections
on margin accounts or options.
   ``I know of very few industries that try to incorporate such
restrictions in their agreements or have been allowed to do that to
such an extent,'' said Earl Cantwell, a Buffalo, N.Y., securities
lawyer who opposes mandatory arbitration.
   Cantwell said the market crash led to more investor complaints
only because people started losing money.
   ``One, two, three years before the crash, a lot of improper
practices by brokers simply went unnoticed or wouldn't be focused
on by investigators because things were going well,'' he said.
   In addition to the state action, a bill introduced in Congress
in July would make it illegal for a broker to turn away a
customer's business for refusing to sign an arbitration clause and
would reform the arbitration process.
   ``It would probably be more beneficial if the arbitration system
itself was fairer and took into consideration the customer's point
of view more frequently than it does now,'' said Maria Crawford
Scott, editor of the journal of the Chicago-based American
Association of Individual Investors.
   Analysts say the system favors brokers because investors are
allowed a limited number of challenges and arbitration boards
generally consist of former securities officials and can be
insensitive to small investors' concerns.
   ``Arbitration remains and probably will remain the primary
dispute resolution for customers with complaints against their
brokers,'' said James C. Meyer, president of the North American
Securities Administrators Association, an organization of state
regulators. ``But that doesn't mean it should be exclusive or
individuals should be denied their fundamental rights.''
   The association said the number of its arbitration cases
quintupled from 800 in 1980 to 4,100 last year and could climb
above 6,000 this year.
   But Fitzpatrick said only a very small percentage of complaints
to the SEC are about arbitration. He said most brokerage firms
don't require customers with cash accounts to sign arbitration
clauses and customers who want to borrow money on margin can go to
banks or elsewhere.
   According to the secretary of state's office, the 16 other
states planning to impose similar regulations are: Alaska,
Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, North Dakota,
Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia,
Washington and Wisconsin.

<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp., the No. 2 computer maker,
is opening its doors to outside technology.
   Analysts say Digital's acquisition of a 5 percent stake in Mips
Computer Systems Inc. marks a move to accept and implement
technological advances occurring outside the company.
   Digital announced plans Wednesday to develop computer work
stations based on the California company's technology.
   Work stations are expensive desktop computers that typically are
used for work that requires extensive manipulation of numbers or
sophisticated graphics, such as science, engineering, design and
financial modeling.
   ``This is an acceptance on DEC's part that the computer user's
dollar is being spent on work stations and small systems,'' said
Bruce Watts, an analyst with Needham & Co.
   ``I think they feel that internally they've got enough on their
hands in terms of keeping their own product line up to date and
competitive, and if they want to tap other segments of the market
they have to look outside,'' he said.
   Digital said it is lining up with Mips, based in Sunnyvale,
Calif., to speed new work station products to the marketplace. The
Maynard-based computer giant is second to Sun Microsystems Inc. in
the fast-growing work station field.
   Under the agreement, Digital will used Mips-designed
microprocessors that use reduced instruction set computing, or
Risc, a way to speed up computing by simplifying the steps a
processor has to carry out. The faster Risc microprocessors are
used increasingly in work stations.
   ``With the addition of Risc technology, Digital will offer
customers even more versatility in computer performance to match
specific application demands,'' said William Strecker, a Digital
vice president.
   Digital stock closed at $92.62{ in composite New York Stock
Exhange trading Wednesday, up 12{ cents.
   Analysts said they expect Digital to unveil a work station using
Mips chip technology by the end of the year. They said the decision
by Digital marks the first time it has strayed from its reliance on
its own Vax computer design.
   Analysts also said the Mips deal marks a concession to industry
standards because Risc-based systems work well with Unix, the
standard operating software made by American Telephone & Telegraph.
   Digital also acquired the right to use future Mips technology.
In the past, Digital has designed all its computer components
itself.

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After advising its stockholders to
ignore two hostile takeover attempts, Polaroid Corp. has sued to
block Shamrock Holdings Inc.'s unwanted bid.
   The suit filed Tuesday in Delaware seeks to prohibit the
Burbank, Calif., -based Shamrock from acquiring any shares of
Polaroid stock or attempting another tender offer and asks that the
company divest itself of Polaroid stock it now owns.
   The suit was filed after Polaroid urged its stockholders to
reject as inadequate a sweetened $2.6 billion takeover bid by
Shamrock. Last month, Polaroid's board of directors turned down
Shamrock's first unsolicited offer.
   The complaint alleges Shamrock engaged in a variety of
securities law violations, including fraudulent, deceptive and
manipulative acts. The suit also claims that Shamrock failed to
disclose material information to stockholders.
   ``Polaroid is taking a more aggressive stance,'' said William
Relyea, a photography analyst with Eberstadt Fleming Inc. in New
York.
   Polaroid officials allege in the suit that Shamrock's offer to
buy Polaroid shares at $42 is ``illusory.'' They said the move
either was designed to allow Shamrock to reap a quick premium by
selling its own Polaroid stock, or to allow Shamrock to pressure
Polaroid into a merger at a price that would be detrimental to
other stockholders.
   Relyea said Polaroid may slow Shamrock down with the lawsuit,
echoing what he said was a widely-held view that Shamrock actually
may be paving the way for another company to take over Polaroid
while it makes a tidy profit.
   The suit also claims Shamrock violated the federal reporting
requirements by failing to disclose the identity of all members of
its ownership group.
   And the suit alleges Shamrock is trying to exclude the Polaroid
employee stock ownership plan from its offer, which is contrary to
federal requirements that all stockholders receive equal treatment
in a tender offer.
   Shamrock spokesman John Grimaldi said Wednesday that the company
had not seen the suit and could not comment.
   Polaroid has asked the U.S. District Court to conduct a hearing
on its request for a preliminary injunction against Shamrock's
offer before Oct. 6.
   Last month, Polaroid rejected an unsolicited offer from Shamrock
that would have paid stockholders $40 a share plus 40 percent of
the eventual award in Polaroid's $5.7 billion patent infringement
lawsuit against Eastman Kodak Co. Analysts valued the offer at
about $44 a share given a $1 billion settlement in the Kodak case.
   After advising stockholders Tuesday to reject the sweetened bid,
Polaroid also filed notice with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in Washington that it has begun preliminary negotiations
with third parties about issuing preferred stock to them, a step
that would make the company harder to take over.
   Shamrock, which is owned by the family of Roy E. Disney, nephew
of the late animator Walt Disney, says that if its bid succeeds it
would drop Polaroid's fledgling venture into 35mm film, sell most
of the company's undeveloped real estate, narrow the company's
manufacturing facilities and simplify Polaroid's research and
development activities to focus on the company's core businesses.
   The offer hinged on the invalidation of Polaroid's recent
issuance of 9.7 million shares to a new employee stock ownership
plan, a move Polaroid made early in its attempt to block Shamrock.

<HEAD>Eastern Renews Call For Bargaining Impasse After Machinists Reject
Offer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines has renewed calls for federal
mediators to declare an impasse in contract talks with its
Machinists union, after 98 percent of the union's voting members
rejected the carrier's latest cost-cutting contract offer.
   ``The predictable defeat of the contract proposal...should send
another strong message to the National Mediation Board that the two
parties are at an impasse,'' Tom Matthews, senior Eastern vice
president of human resources, said Wednesday.
   ``The board must act quickly to release the parties from
dead-end mediation to resolve these issues,'' he said. Contract
talks began nine months ago.
   The union vote tallied Wednesday showed 81 percent of the
union's 9,500 mechanics and ground-support workers cast ballots,
with 98 percent voting ``no,'' and 90 ballots in favor of the
proposal that local President Charles Bryan says would slash pay in
half.
   Eastern has lost about $1 billion in the past decade and posted
a second-quarter loss of $89.8 million. The company says the $161
million in wage concessions it seeks represent pay cuts of 10 to 20
percent.
   An impasse could be declared if federal mediator Harry Bickford
told the board he could do no more. If the board agreed, both
parties would have a chance for arbitration. If either party
declined, that would begin a 30-day cooling off period, after which
the union would become free to strike and Eastern could impose its
conditions unilaterally.
   Bryan, who expects negotiations to resume soon, said Eastern's
offer was unacceptable because it would cut pay, sick days,
vacation time and medical benefits.
   The vote ``makes it crystal-clear that the membership were very
concerned, by the number who turned out. The people were very
angry,'' said Bryan.
   But Eastern says cuts are essential to restore the carrier to
profitability. On Sept. 10, the Miami-based carrier eliminated
4,000 jobs, and two weeks earlier it cut 12 percent of its routes,
ending service to 14 cities.
   ``We believe it was our best offer,'' Eastern spokeswoman Karen
Ceremsak said of the proposal offered in July.
   Bryan claimed that Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent
firm Texas Air Corp., hoped for a strike. Bryan reiterated his
contentions that Lorenzo aims to give Eastern assets to sister
carrier Continental Airlines, which is largely non-union.
   ``Absolutely not true,'' Ms. Ceremsak said. ``What we do want is
a 30-day cooling-off period. We believe the only way we can reach a
settlement is if we have a deadline. Without a deadline, there's no
incentive for the IAM to settle.''
   Eastern also is negotiating a contract with its pilots union,
which with the flight attendants union took 20 percent wage cuts in
1986.
   Bryan blames the company's money troubles on poor management,
and said the union offered to take a one-year pay freeze.

   Financial uncertainty caused by the
drought are forcing farmers to hold off buying new machinery for
their fields, dashing hopes for a banner year in the farm equipment
industry, according to some salesmen.
   ``This year will certainly slow down next year, maybe not as
much, but there wil be a cloud hanging over us. It takes a lot of
years for a farmer to recover a loss,'' said Doug Hennessey, a
territory manager for White New Idea Farm Equipment Co., based in
Coldwater.
   ``Normally, they'll trade it in on a 3-5 year basis, and this
would've been the greatest fall in eight years. But then the
drought hit and delayed their opportunity to buy,'' said B.E.
Miller, southern Ohio marketing manager for Case IH.
   Hennessey and Miller were among approximately 500 commercial
exhibitors at the three-day Farm Science Review, which ends
Thursday. The agricultural exposition included about $40 million
worth of farm equipment.
   The number of hours a farmer uses a tractor varies, but Case's
C.L. Lephart said an average for a cash grain farmer would be about
250 hours a year. Normally, a farmer may trade that in after five
years, but now they are allowing their equipment to depreciate and
trading it in with as many as 7,000 hours on it.
   Miller said this year's drought was a particular letdown because
analysts finally were anticipating a good year after years of a
depressed farm economy.
   ``They'd finally got their debt load paid off, which would've
permitted them to come back and buy, but now...'' said Miller, his
voice trailing off.
   Lephart, Case marketing manager for northwest Ohio, said the
drought led to a new marketing plan. ``Discounts, financing,
leases. We're seeing a lot more of all of these,'' Lephart said.
   John Deere Co. parts marketing manager Bob Hothem said the
company hopes to cash in on a U.S. Department of Agriculture
projection that there will be as many as 25 million new acres to
till next year.
   While equipment sales have been slow, a different type of
machinery has moved out of the storerooms and onto the farms.
   Tillage equipment, such as field cultivators, have sold better
than usual ``because no-tillage didn't work out,'' Hennessey said,
referring to a farming method aimed at soil conservation
   ``Conventional and mechanical tillage is coming back into
play,'' Lepart said.
   Lepart and Miller think 1989 will be a better year for sales,
but say they won't be able to put profits into perspective until
all crops are harvested.
   ``There's certainly a lot of room for optimism,'' Miller said.
   The Farm Science Review, on the 992-acre Molly Caren Agriculture
Center, about 25 miles west of Columbus, included field
demonstrations and exhibits by farm equipment manufacturers and
dealers. The annual agribusiness exposition is sponsored by Ohio
State University.

   General Motors Corp. has agreed to
revise an advertising plan that state authorities say would boost
car prices while illegally forcing dealers to participate,
according to Attorney General Charlie Brown.
   Separately, a group of Ohio auto dealers has sued to block a
similar advertising plan in their state.
   GM's Chevrolet Motors division planned to increase the amount
its dealer franchises pay for their cars by 1 percent _ an average
of $40 to $50 a car _ to finance a dealers association that would
run the automaker's national advertising campaigns.
   The company offered dealers who joined the association a 25
percent discount on the surcharge, but told those who did not join
that they would not receive the discount, Brown said Wednesday in
announcing the settlement.
   Under the plan, the dealers would pass on the surcharge to car
buyers. Chevrolet planned to begin the program with its September
shipments and tacked the 1 percent charge on to its dealers' bills
for this month.
   ``A lot of dealers complained about it,'' Brown said.
   Brown said he learned about the Chevrolet plan in August. Steve
Herndon, solicitor general for the attorney general's office,
investigated the plan, then informed Chevrolet that it violated
West Virginia law.
   Under the law, autmobile dealers cannot be required to
participate in a dealers association.
   ``This type of deceptive business practice is a violation of
fair trade competition, and the consumer is the ultimate victim,''
Brown said.
   ``Obviously, if GM dealers have to compete with other GM dealers
(in advertising), it means better prices for consumers,'' Herndon
said.
   The attorney general's office and Chevrolet last week negotiated
a settlement under which dealers will participate in the ad plan
only if they want, and then pay the discounted fee. Those who don't
participate will be paid an amount equivalent to the 25 percent
discount.
   Dealers did not pay the September charge, Herndon said.
   At least 27 other states have auto dealer laws similar to West
Virginia's, the attorney general said.
   Other automakers _ including Ford Motor Co. _ have tried similar
tactics, Brown said.
   In Ohio, the Ohio Automobile Dealers Association and three Ohio
dealerships sued GM and its GMC Truck and Chevrolet divisions in
U.S. District Court in Columbus, alleging a similar advertising
program in Ohio violates state law prohibiting mandatory
participation in a dealers association.
   They plaintiffs want the court to stop the program and award
them any damages allowed under state law, plus double the amount GM
has collected under the program.
   The Sept. 8 suit has not been scheduled for trial. GM has not
filed a response.

<HEAD>U.S. Official Says United States, EEC Far Apart on Meat Hormones,
Airbus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and its European
trading partners remain far apart on solving disputes over a ban on
hormone-treated meat and support for civil aircraft development, a
U.S. official said Thursday.
   But Alfred H. Kingon, the U.S. ambassador to the European
Economic Community, told a news conference that trade relations
between the United States and the 12-nation European trading bloc
are ``actually pretty good.''
   ``We have succeeded in the last year and a half of cleaning the
table of most of the troublesome trade issues that existed some two
years ago between the United States and the community,'' he said.
   Trade between the EEC and the United States will likely exceed
more than $160 billion this year, up from $145 billion in 1987 and
$131 billion in 1986, Kingon said.
   Two key disputes remaining, he said, are European enforcement of
a ban on meat from animals treated with growth hormones and U.S.
objections to government support for Airbus Industrie, a
four-nation European consortium that competes with Boeing Co. and
McDonnell Douglas Corp.
   Kingon said little progress has been made on either issue and no
resolution was in sight.
   The meat hormone dispute, he said, ``is perhaps the most
difficult problem on the table.''
   An EEC spokesman, who demanded anonymity, said, ``No new
initiative can be expected from the (community) on hormones. There
is a deadlock.''
   The EEC says it wants to ban imports of all hormone-treated meat
for health reasons. Late last year, it decided to delay
implementation of the ban until Jan. 1, 1989.
   The United States had threatened to take retaliatory action if
the ban was imposed. It contends the use of hormones to fatten
animals, which is a common practice among American farmers, is not
a health risk.
   Kingon predicted the issue would wind up in the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an international body that solves
disputes between trading partners.
   On the Airbus issue, Kingon said negotiations were continuing.
But, he said, ``I would not want to mislead you to say we are close
to a solution because we're not.''
   A key objective of U.S.-European negotiations has been to set
``effective discipline'' on new infusions of capital and on the
conditions under which government support may be provided to future
civil aircraft programs.
   The four governments involved in the Airbus program are Britain,
France, West Germany and Spain.
   The EEC is made up of Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France,

<HEAD>SEC Said to Authorizes Civil Charges Against New York Bond House</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has
authorized its staff to charge Matthews & Wright Group Inc. and
several officers of the bond house with fraud and other abuses in
connection with the underwriting of more than $1 billion in
municipal bonds, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.
   Quoting what it called people familiar with the situation, the
newspaper said the SEC took the unannounced step at a closed-door
meeting Tuesday. The reported action followed a major inquiry into
the New York firm's activities.
   SEC spokeswoman Mary McCue declined comment on the Journal
report, in accordance with the agency's policy on enforcement
matters.
   But the SEC had stated in a previously published notice that its
agenda for the Tuesday session included ``institution of
administrative proceedings of an enforcement nature.''
   David Aufhauser, a Matthews & Wright attorney, was not
immediately available to comment, a receptionist said. The Journal
quoted him as saying he'd had discussions with the SEC staff but
could not elaborate.
   Matthews & Wright has consistently denied wrongdoing and has
asserted its underwriting practices conform with industry practices.
   The Journal quoted sources as saying the SEC action means the
agency's enforcement staff will enter into settlement negotiations
with Matthews & Wright. If those fail, the sources were quoted as
saying, the SEC may charge the firm with a range of alleged abuses.
   Most of the charges stem from Matthews & Wright's role as an
underwriter of 25 municipal bond deals in 1985 and 1986, the
sources were quoted as saying.
   The SEC case doesn't include the firm's best-known deals, $380
million in questionable issues underwritten for Guam and the
Northern Mariana islands in 1984 and 1985, the newspaper quoted
sources as saying.
   It was unclear why these were omitted, but the newspaper said it
may have been because other government enforcement agencies are
scrutinizing them.
   Last year a federal grand jury in Guam charged Arthur Abba
Goldberg, the firm's executive vice president, with fraud, bribery
and obstruction of justice. He's pleaded innocent and will go on
trial in January.
   In August, the Internal Revenue Service decreed that interest
income on the Guam and Mariana bonds aren't tax-exempt. This is
significant because the tax-exempt status of such issues is a major
selling point of municipal bonds.

   The co-chairman of the congressionally
appointed National Economic Commission says he did not call for tax
hikes or cuts in Social Security to help erase the federal deficit,
despite several reports to the contrary.
   ``I am somewhat surprised that there has been so much interest
in my remarks'' in a speech Tuesday to an economic consulting firm,
Robert S. Strauss said in a statement Wednesday. ``Let me make it
clear that I did not call for or endorse cuts in the Social
Security programs. Nor did I endorse a tax increase.
   ``I did tell the cold, statistical truth about the size of the
deficit. I further stated that the views expressed were my own.''
   Strauss said Tuesday in a speech that Social Security, Medicare
and other government entitlement programs would have to be cut and
spending would also have to be reduced in defense programs in order
to get the deficit under control.
   ``We have to go to Social Security, Medicare and entitlements
generally and we have to go to defense,'' Strauss said, adding that
he realized how politically charged such comments were.
   ``That means you are withholding money from the sick, the
elderly and the defense of the nation,'' he said in the Tuesday
speech.
   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis said Wednesday
if the commission recommended cuts in Social Security ``they won't
get to first base in a Dukakis-Bentsen administration.''
   ``I oppose reductions in scheduled payments to Social Security
recipients, and I am committed to maintaining full benefits and
full cost of living increases,'' Dukakis added.
   The Bush presidential campaign also denounced Strauss'
suggestions.
   ``Any request (by the economic commission) for new taxes or tax
increases or a raid on the Social Security system would be bounced
back immediately with the stamp `Return to Sender.' We would not
take delivery on either of those proposals,'' said Bush spokesman
Mark Goodin.
   Strauss, a lawyer and former chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, said in his clarifying statement that defense
expenditures account for 28 percent of the federal budget and
entitlement programs account for 47 percent.
   ``That leads to an inescapable conclusion: to the extent that we
reduce the debt by reducing outlays, it has to be done largely in
defense and entitlements,'' he said in the statement.
   Nevertheless, reports of Strauss' remarks spurred a vehement
Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., to promise Social Security will
``never'' be cut to help wipe out the federal deficit.
   ``As chairman of the (Finance) subcomittee on Social Security,
I'm here to say never,'' Moynihan said at a news conference
Wednesday. ``It mustn't be done and it won't be.''
   Moynihan is one of the commission's 12 members, and, in fact,
the body was created by legislation he sponsored, at the urging of
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   ``We have finally got the Social Security system in stable,
solid, surplus condition,'' Moynihan said. ``To start raiding the
trust fund would be unforgivable, given what we did in 1983.''
   That year, Congress passed Social Security reforms that resulted
in $160 billion worth of additional revenues and benefit reductions
over the years 1983 to 1990, according to Moynihan.
   ``That was the contribution of the Social Security system to
reducing the deficit, a contribution already made,'' he said.
   The commission is composed of six Republicans and six Democrats
appointed by Congress. After the November election, the new
president will appoint two new members, one from each party.

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community will
ask for an international trade inquiry into U.S. restrictions on
imports of sugar, a spokeswoman for the European Commission said.
   The Commission will make the request at a meeting Thursday of
the Council of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the
international trade organization meeting in Uruguay and studying
ways to improve world trade relations.
   The panel will be asked to examine the EEC's contention that the
long-standing U.S. import curbs are inconsistent with international
trading rules, said the spokeswoman, who declined to be named.
   The EEC and U.S. officials had two inconclusive rounds of talks
on the issue in July and early in September, she said.
   The United States has imposed import restrictions on sugar,
dairy products, peanuts and cotton for many years ince it was
granted a waiver from international trade rules in 1955.
   The EEC contends that the protection enabled U.S. farmers to
build up their production of the commodities.
   Sugar production in the United States rose to 5.4 million tons
in 1986 from 4.2 million tons in 1955, according to the EEC.
   The spokeswoman said that the U.S. import quota for sugar in
1988 amounted to 700,000 metric tons while the EEC imported 4
million tons of sugar last year.
   The spokeswoman said that the EEC had similar complaints about
the other products covered by the waiver but is still reviewing
those cases.
   She also said that the EEC would express to the GATT Council its
concern about the U.S. trade bill which it believes to be
protectionist and potentially damaging for the Uruguay round of
international trade talks.

   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 7
points, or 0.4 percent, at 1,789.8 at about 12:30 p.m.
   The index traded narrowly throughout the morning. At its best,

   ``The market is at the moment really all about rumors and
takeovers,'' the salesman said. ``It's frankly pretty low quality

<NOTE>Eds: John Cunniff is on assignment.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Two companies are trying to add some glitter to the drab copper
and iron-ore mining scene of far northern Michigan.
   It started as a glint in a Dow Chemical Co. metallurgist's eye.
First Dow, and now a Colorado company, Crystal Exploration Inc.,
entered the search for diamonds in the state's Upper Peninsula.
   Seven Kimberlite pipes _ volcanic rock shafts that can yield the
earth's hardest mineral _ have been discovered.
   Core drilling has unearthed a scattering of sand-grain sized
diamonds, too few and too small for commercial production. But the
explorers say the search is young.
   The pipe formations are in a 40-mile area around Iron Mountain
and Crystal Falls, at the western end of the Upper Peninsula along
the Wisconsin border.
   In the few places on earth they are found, Kimberlite pipes
occur in clusters of up to several dozen, said James Huml, a Dow
research associate.
   Huml, a metallurgist by trade and geologist by avocation, said
he thinks there are more than a dozen Kimberlite pipes in the Upper
Peninsula.
   Dow has searched for six years. Now more exploration and mining
expertise is needed, Huml said. ``Dow is not a hard-rock mining
company.''
   Dow recently sold its mineral leases and geological data, for an
undisclosed amount, to Crystal Exploration Inc., a Colorado
subsidiary of Sydney, Australia's Restech International Ltd.
Restech has mineral exploration and gold mining operations in
western Australia.
   It will carry on the search, while Dow holds onto an option to
take part in the exploration and development, and to share in any
profits.
   Occasional diamond finds in Ohio farm fields in the late 1800s
and early 1900s long had geologists looking to the north, said
Crystal Exploration's president, Sigfried Muessig.
   Muessig said a Kimberlite pipe, named for Kimberly in the
diamond-mining region of South Africa, is the only formation known
to produce the gems.
   ``It is a cylindrical formation where volcanic rock has come up
120 miles from the bowels of the earth, and the heat and pressure
have formed the diamonds,'' he said.
   ``It's a very rare occurrence,'' Huml said. Other Kimberlite
pipes have been found in Arkansas, Kansas, Wyoming and Colorado.
None commercially produce diamonds.
   There were no volcanic remnants in Ohio, so geologists thought
glaciers carried the diamonds there from Canada, Muessig said.
   But he said the focus shifted in 1981 when the U.S. Geological
Survey found a Kimberlite formation _ the Lake Ellen Pipe _ about
10 miles northeast of Crystal Falls.
   It was evidence that volcanoes smoked and spewed nearly 200
million years ago in the Upper Peninsula, and possibly generated
the heat and compression forces to leave a diamond treasure behind.
   The glaciers flattened the volcanoes, but since 1981 Dow has
found six more Kimberlite pipes _ several hundred feet across at
the surface and covered by volcanic debris, Huml said.
   In Dow's explorations, he said, ``We have found microdiamonds,
generally small, less than a millimeter in diameter. They are
grain-sized.''
   But the explorers still think the western Upper Peninsula was
the source of the gems found in farm fields to the south. ``We
think there is good potential, because of the historical finds,''
Muessig said.
   Crystal Exploration will do more sampling in the already
discovered pipes in the next year, Muessig said, and will continue
exploring for more Kimberlite formations, ``in hopes the next pipe
we discover will have gem-quality stones.''

   The stock market held steady today, continuing
its recent indecisive pattern.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.07 to 2,091.57 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers and losers were evenly balanced in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 415 up, 424 down and
515 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 19.59 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said nothing had happened to break the standoff that
set in several weeks ago on Wall Street.
   Some prominent analysts and policymakers, including Chairman
Alan Greenspan of the Federal Reserve Board, have been warning of
the dangers of revived inflation.
   Yet the price of gold, a primary gauge of inflationary
expectations, has fallen below $400 an ounce this week for the
first time in more than a year and a half.
   Similarly, brokers say, there is widespread confusion and
uncertainty among investors about prospects for continued economic
growth in 1989 under a new administration whose makeup and policies
are not yet known.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Sears Roebuck gained \ to 37|;
Coca-Cola rose \ to 43\; Merck was unchanged at 58{, and American
Telephone & Telegraph dropped [ to 26].
   Reebok International, which reported a higher order backlog than

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.13 to 152.77. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .20 at 298.77.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average edged up 3.02 to
2,090.50.
   But declining issues slightly outnumbered advances on the NYSE,
677 up, 701 down and 526 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 127.40 million shares, against 142.22

<HEAD>Northwest Airlines Rejects $200 Million Offer to Sell Land in
Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines has rejected a $200
million offer from Japanese real estate developers to sell land it
owns in Tokyo, officials of the airline said.
   Northwest officials declined Wednesday to discuss details of the
purchase offer from Koshin Corp. or say why it was rejected.
   ``We don't have any property that's for sale,'' said spokesman
Redmond Tyler.
   But in a letter to the U.S. real estate agent for Koshin,
Northwest Vice Chairman James A. Abbott said the airline believes
the land is worth more than has been offered and said it ``has been
retained for possible further development by us in connection with
our business in Japan.''
   The developers wanted to build high-rise condominiums on the
50,000-square-foot plot, which would have been sold to
property-starved Japa- nese consumers for $10 million to $15
million apiece. Koshin hoped to place 60 to 65 units on the
property.
   KOAR Inc., a Los Angeles-based real estate firm representing
Koshin, said the property sought by Koshin contains five or six
small two-story buildings that the airline uses to house employees,
including flight crews and corporate staff members, on both a
permanent and temporary basis. KOAR officials said the property is
surrounded by exclusive residences, department stores and high-rise
office buildings.
   Because of the scarcity of land and the density of the
population in Japan, developers there are willing to buy property
for $4,000 per square foot, which is the amount turned down by
Northwest.
   Tyler would not describe the property and said Northwest did not
want to discuss its real estate holdings.
   KOAR said Northwest has owned the property for more than 30
years, which would mean that it obtained it at a fraction of the
price it could fetch today.
   KOAR and Koshin together own 366,600 shares of Northwest stock,
which represents about 1.3 percent of outstanding shares. The price
of Northwest stock rose 87.5 cents to $50.125 Wednesday, as news of
the offer by Koshin circulated broadly among brokers.
   KOAR officials said Koshin has been trying to initiate
discussions with Northwest officials about a land deal since May to
no avail.
   Koshin made its most recent all-cash offer two weeks ago, in
which it ``implored NWA to act in its shareholders' best
interests,'' said KOAR officials. Northwest responded Sept. 12 with
a letter from Abbott, which was provided to the Star Tribune of
Minneapolis by KOAR Vice President Bruce Rothman, the newspaper
said.

<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission today
announced that no enforcement action would be taken against those
involved in the sale and default of $2.25 billion of Washington
Public Power Supply System bonds.
   In a 376-page report on its five-year investigation, the
commission staff criticized several parties involved in the sale of
the WPPSS bonds, which were issued to finance two nuclear power
projects that eventually were terminated.
   The report concluded that enforcement action was unnecessary
because of a civil trial, difficulty in determining responsibility
for disclosure statements attached to the bonds and concern that
the commission lacked the resources to pursue the case.
   However, because of settlements in the civil trial, parties
considered most responsible in the sale of the bonds will not be
required to argue their cases in a public forum.
   Bondholders are suing 15 utilities that are members of WPPSS,
the construction arm of the state's public utilities, plus a
financial advisor and two engineering firms in a trial that began
Sept. 7 in Tucson, Ariz.
   Most parties originally named as defendants in the suit,
including WPPSS itself, have settled out of court for a total of
$461 million, including $96 million in contested insurance claims.
   The report concluded that the default, the largest in municipal
bond history, resulted from extensive cost overruns and
construction delays at WPPSS Project No. 4 at the Hanford nuclear
reservation in southeastern Washington state and No. 5 at Satsop,
west of Olympia, Wash.
   WPPSS, which issued the bonds, was responsible for the official
statements used to sell them but ``avoided disclosure of negative
developments,'' the report said. ``Most significantly, the supply
system failed to disclose that, in October 1980, participants, who
were concerned about rising project costs and falling power
demands, asked the supply system to study a possible slowdown or
termination of the projects.''
   Work was halted on the projects in 1981, both were abandoned in
January 1982 and in 1983 WPPSS quit making payments on the bonds
after the Washington state Supreme Court held that the utilities'
contracts with the consortium were illegal and thus unenforceable.
Without payments from the 88 participating utilities, many in other
states, WPPSS defaulted.
   The commission report also faulted the WPPSS bond counsel, the
firm of Wood Dawson Smith & Hellman of New York, which was
responsible for assuring that the disclosures accompanying the bond
sales were clear on the requirements that participating utilities
pay for the projects.
   ``Although opinions on legal issues frequently contain some
uncertainty, the state of the law was not as clear as those relying
on the counsel's opinions might reasonably have assumed,'' the
report said. ``Further steps were not taken to clarify legal
matters.''
   Wood Dawson settled outside court in the federal trial in Tucson
for $500,000.
   Bond underwriters, including some of the largest brokerage
houses on Wall Street, also were ``in a position to discover
inadequacies'' in the disclosures, the report said.
   ``They did not, however, conduct the kind of investigation in
the offerings of these competitively bid bonds that they perform in
negotiated bond sales and in corporate securities offerings,'' the
report said.
   Bond underwriters settled in the massive lawsuit for $92
million. Despite the size of that settlement, representatives of
the 24,000 bond buyers with claims in the federal lawsuit said it
was less than the profit of the underwriting firms in selling the
WPPSS bonds.
   Besides the 15 utilities, defendants in the trial include the
firm of Blyth Eastman, financial advisor to WPPSS, and the
construction engineering firms of United Engineers & Constructors
and Ebasco.

mixed today on the Chicago Board of Trade with little news in the
market to influence prices.
   Soybean futures posted slight gains at the opening in reaction
to a Soviet newspaper report that the Soviet Union's grain harvest
this year would be smaller than the relatively good harvests of the
two previous years.
   But soybeans quickly turned lower on reports of beneficial rain
in the soybean-growing region of Argentina and selling linked to
the advancing corn and soybean harvest in the Midwest.
   Harvest pressure is overhanging the grain markets as well,
limiting the potential for strong rallies, analysts said.
   ``There really is not much of a story developing,'' said Ted
Mao, grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
``The harvest is progressing and in general the market is a little
bit tired.''
   In early trading, wheat was 1\ cents to 2 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.21\ a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 1{ cents lower with December at $2.86} a bushel; oats
were 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher with December at $2.55 a bushel;
soybeans were 3{ cents lower to \ cent higher with November at
$8.36{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .12 cent lower to .18 cent higher with October
at 69.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .35 cent lower to .15
cent higher with September at 79.40 cents a pound; hogs were .35
cent lower to .13 cent higher with October at 38.90 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .20 cent to .55 cent higher with February
at 50.87 cents a pound.

   The nation's savings institutions continued to
lose billions of dollars, but at a slightly slower rate in the
second quarter of this year when compared to the previous six
months, the government said today.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said the nation's 3,000 S&Ls
lost $3.6 billion in the April-June period, an improvement over a
$3.9 billion loss in the first quarter and a record $4.0 billion
loss in the last three months of 1987.
   The report came as the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee
predicted that taxpayers will have to provide $20 billion in a
``bailout-to-come'' to solve the financial crisis confronting the
industry.
   In a speech prepared for delivery on the Senate floor today,
Chairman William Proxmire, D-Wis., said it was his ``reluctant but
profound conviction'' that the problem ``has grown beyond industry
resources.''
   James Barth, chief economist for the bank board, said, however,
``I like to think we have bottomed out and things won't get much
worse.''
   ``But there's still a serious problem,'' he aded.
   S&Ls lost a record $7.8 billion last year and seem certain to
surpass that this year, having lost $7.5 billion in the first six
months.
   As in the past, the industry's losses in the second quarter were
concentrated in a relatively few number of institutions and in one
state _ Texas, which has been hard hit by the collapse of oil
prices.
   The 271 thrift institutions in Texas accounted for $3.2 billion
of the loss. The 20 worst institutions in the nation _ 17 of them
in Texas _ lost $2.6 billion.
   There were 497 insolvent institutions, down from 509 in the
first quarter. The bank board resolved the cases of 26 institutions
in the April-June period, and 14 more institutions slipped into the
red.
   Twenty-nine percent of the industry lost money _ $5.1 billion in
the second quarter _ more than offsetting the $1.5 billion profit
earned by the remmaining 71 percent.
   Proxmire, in his speech, Proxmire said the taxpayers will have
to contribute $20 billion toward fixing the problem and he accused
the new treasury secretary of being ``nonchalant'' about the crisis.
   Even if the next Congress appropriates the $20 billion, healthy
S&Ls will need to contribute another $30 billion over the next
several years, he said.
   ``The bailout-to-come will be the largest ever in the history of
the U.S. It will be far bigger than the combined cost of the
assistance ... to Chrysler (Corp.), Lockheed (Corp.) and New York
City,'' he said.
   Despite that, he said, ``the administration has its head buried
in the sand'' and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady in his
confirmation hearing last week ``was nonchalant about the S&L
mess.''
   Brady, who replaced James A. Baker III, contended that the
industry-financed Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which
guarantees S&L deposits up to $100,000, has as much as it can spend
for now.
   Estimates of the cost of cleaning up the industry vary from the
bank board's $31 billion to private projections as high as $100
billion.
   The current bank board estimate is well within its $42 billion
10-year revenue projection, but the agency has said it will issue
an revised cost estimate this fall.
   An official of the General Accounting Office, the auditing arm
of Congress, told the House Banking Committee last week that the
problem was in the $45 billion to $50 billion range and would
require money from Congress.
   The American Bankers Association, a trade group representing
commercial banks, this week pegged the cost at $74 billion.
   Meanwhile, Brady on Wednesday ordered a top deputy,
Undersecretary George D. Gould, to look into the rapidly growing
cost estimates. He called on Congress to consider several steps,
including authorizing an additional $5 billion in borrowing by
FSLIC, before appropriating tax money.
   A senior Treasury Department official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the FSLIC has enough funds to operate ``well into
next year.'' However, if the higher cost estimates appear to be
valid, ``then we'll say what this means to funding FSLIC, how much
it needs and how it should get it,'' he said.
   Federal regulators have greatly accelerated the pace of S&L
closings and mergers since mid-August, committing more than $13
billion in aid to resolve the cases of more than 50 institutions.
   However, Proxmire charged that, ``The regulators are engaging in
sham resolutions. ... These are garbage deals with garbage
thrifts.''
   The rescues have brought little money from private investors and
the acquiring institutions themselves often are thinly capitalized,
he said. In other cases, regulators are striking ``Faustian
bargains'' with investors who plan to use S&L deposits to further
their own business ventures, he said.
   Karl Hoyle, a spokesman for the bank board, said the bank board
has brought in substantial private capital with its rescues _ $1
billion since July 1987 _ and expects to bring another $750 million
in by the end of this year.
   Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, the senior Republican on the banking
committee, issued a statement assailing ``sanctimonious attempts''
and ``partisan charges'' to shift the blame for the S&L crisis onto
the administration.
   While he did not mention Proxmire by name, he said he was
``outraged by repeated efforts to get the U.S. taxpayers to pick up
the tab.''

   Stock prices drifted lower today in selling
apparently prompted by impatience over the market's recent sluggish
performance.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 5.15 to 2,085.35
by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 488 up, 731 down and
564 unchanged.
   Analysts said the market's sluggish recent behavior apparently
convinced some investors that stocks were unable to break out of
the trading range in which they have fluctuated for several months
now.
   They also noted an absence of conviction about the business
outlook to encourage any buying.
   Some prominent analysts and policymakers, including Chairman
Alan Greenspan of the Federal Reserve Board, have been warning of
the dangers of revived inflation.
   Yet the price of gold, a primary gauge of inflationary
expectations, has fallen below $400 an ounce this week for the
first time in more than a year and a half.
   Similarly, brokers say, there is widespread confusion and
uncertainty among investors about prospects for continued economic
growth in 1989 under a new administration whose makeup and policies
are not yet known.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines rose \ to 113{; American Express was unchanged at 27~, and
American Telephone & Telegraph slipped [ to 26].
   Reebok International, which reported a higher order backlog than
a year ago, rose ] to 11 in active trading.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .17 to 152.47. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .63 at 298.34.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 76.28 million shares at
noontime, up from 57.29 million Wednesday, when activity was
diminished somewhat by the observance of the Jewish holiday Yom
Kippur.

<HEAD>Three Years After Plaza Accord, Currency Markets Still Unsettled</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: John Cunniff is on assignment.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Today marks the third anniversary of the Plaza
Accord, a five-nation agreement that might be described as the
Kellogg-Briand Pact of the financial world.
   The Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928 was an international agreement
to renounce war as an instrument of national policy. In light of
subsequent conflicts _ World War II comes immediately to mind _
Kellogg-Briand was a miserable failure.
   The Plaza Accord of Sept. 22, 1985, was an agreement by the
United States, Britain, West Germany, France and Japan to push down
the exchange value of the dollar. The idea was that a cheaper
dollar would help shrink the U.S. trade deficit and reduce
protectionist sentiments in Congress.
   At first, the Plaza Accord looked like a smash success. The
dollar tumbled all through 1985 and 1986 and into 1987. Only a few
impolite skeptics said the dollar would have fallen even without
the accord.
   Then, some funny things happened. First, the finance ministers
got together again at the Louvre in Paris in February 1987 and
decided that further declines in the dollar would be
counterproductive.
   Naturally, the dollar kept falling. Then it rose. Then it fell
steeply at the end of 1987. This year it has risen _ up a fat 14
percent against a marketbasket of foreign currencies since Jan. 1.
   In light of these gyrations, it has begun to seem as though the
finance leaders are standing at the bow of an ocean liner with a
toy wheel, trying to convince the other passengers they are
steering.
   All this time, people began to notice the cheaper dollar was not
working wonders on the trade deficit. Instead of shrinking, the gap
set records in 1986 and again in 1987. It has taken until this year
to see big improvements.
   As time went on, it has become increasingly clear that:
   1. Central bankers and finance ministers don't have much control
over currency rates.
   2. Currency rates do not have nearly as much to do with trade
balances as everyone had thought.
   This is not to say the 3-year-old Plaza Accord was a waste of
time. It was a valuable beginning toward cooperation in an
interdependent world. But this is where the comparison with
Kellogg-Briand comes in.
   In 1985 as in 1928, agreements between nations depend on the
signatories' willingness to adapt their national goals to the
greater international good. And that is a hard sell.
   Currency rates will never be stable as long as nations pursue
widely differing economic policies: abhorrence of inflation in West
Germany vs. relative tolerance of it in the United States, for
example.
   The gold standard for currencies forced policy coordination on
the nations, but its fatal flaw was that it put all the burden of
adjustment on weak-currency countries. That gave undue leverage to
the slow-growth West Germanys of the world.
   Businesses want stable currency rates so they can plan where to
locate plants, how much to manufacture for export, from which
nations to buy components and so on.
   Three years after the Plaza Accord, however, the goal of stable
currencies is beginning to look like a distant dream. Economists'
estimates of the ``proper'' value of the dollar are all over the
map, from 100 yen to 200 yen (the current rate is 134).
   Differing economic policies have something to do with the
instability, as do differing predictions for the trade deficit.
   Adding to the complexity is that trade flows are not the only
controlling factor in rates. Investment flows are at least as
important _ meaning that if Japanese for whatever reason crave U.S.
Treasury bonds and factories, they will keep the dollar in strong
demand even though they have little interest in importing American
products.
   Stabilize currencies? Abolish war? Good luck.

<HEAD>Irving, Bank of New York `Celebrate' 1st Anniversary Of Takeover
War</HEAD>

   Bank of New York Co.'s $1.2 billion bid for
rival Irving Bank Corp. has staggered to the one-year mark with
neither side ready to throw in the towel, or even call the outcome.
   At first, it had the distinction of being the first-ever hostile
takeover fight between two big American banks. Now it has become
the lengthiest such battle among major U.S. corporations.
   The strain of the bidding marathon clearly has taken its toll at
both large New York institutions by distracting management from
their usual work, confusing stockholders and piling up millions of
dollars in legal and other expenses.
   A third, friendly contender, Milan-based Banca Commerciale
Italiana SpA, recently was forced out of the running due to an
unfavorable ruling by the Federal Reserve Board, which is patiently
overseeing the proposed merger process.
   ``It's the economic equivalent of the Iran-Iraq war because of
the length and the substantial casualties,'' said H. Rodgin Cohen,
an attorney for the Bank of New York.
   ``At least we're not using poison gas,'' the bank's chairman, J.
Carter Bacot, said jokingly in a recent interview. ``Only `poison
pills' are involved.''
   The outcome of the Irving-Bank of New York war, which began on
Sept. 25, 1987, is likely to be decided in a New York state court,
where, among other things, Irving's ``poison pill'' anti-takeover
defense is under attack. Some observers say the entire process
could drag on into the winter.
   In the meantime, the takeover attempt appears to have turned
into a struggle of personalities between Bacot and Irving's equally
strong-minded chairman, Joseph A. Rice.
   Analysts say Bacot is determined to merge the two banks not only
because the two would fit nicely together but because he fears Bank
of New York itself could become a takeover target if a big West
Coast or foreign bank decided to enter the New York market.
   A merger would nearly double Bank of New York's size, making it
the 11th largest banking company in the country and a more elusive
target.
   Rice, analysts say, has his own vision of running his bank and
believes it is worth much more than the Bank of New York's offer,
especially given its past investments in technological advances.
   Both men have held only a handful of face-to-face meetings since
Bacot formally proposed the merger, and each time talks have broken
off without any signs of progress. No new talks are planned
because, Rice said, ``we see absolutely nothing to be gained at
this stage.''
   ``I think the financial issues were certainly important to
Irving early on and now, but ... it clearly has become a personal
issue,'' said Michael Starr, a banking analyst for Duff & Phelps
Inc. in Chicago.
   Cohen, a partner of Sullivan & Cromwell, which has represented
many firms in takeovers, agreed. ``My own judgment is that they
have created this fiction that the Bank of New York is evil and
horrible ... It's almost a crusade.''
   That is an unfortunate turn of events, many analysts contend,
since both banks have similar markets and services and would work
well together.
   Irving has waged a tough defense to Bank of New York's
persistent overtures, from poison pills to proxy fights. A recently
instituted ``flip-in'' provision to its poison pill would make an
unsolicited merger prohibitively expensive by giving all Irving
shareholders, except Bank of New York, the right to buy $400 of
stock for $200 once Bank of New York acquires 20 percent of Irving.
   ``The Irving board has taken enough action of a defensive nature
and the burden is now on them to be able to show that they are not
merely trying to entrench themselves and Irving's management,''
said Abraham Nad, publisher of the monthly newsletter Directorship,
an authority on corporate boards. ``That's a very fine line to
walk.''
   Bacot says he first broached the idea of a merger at a luncheon
with Rice about five years ago. Rice wasn't very receptive then, he
recalled. He conceded that Irving probably ``resents the fact we
put an offer on the table like that'' after it had turned down the
Bank of New York privately.
   What's particularly noteworthy about this battle is that it's
occurring in an industry where hostile takeovers are rare. Even in
the best of circumstances, the complex, time-consuming regulatory
requirements that other industries are spared could make some banks
think twice about a merger.
   When the bid first emerged, some experts predicted hostile bids
could become more commonplace, particularly among aggressive
regional institutions. They're not so sure anymore.
   ``Hostile takeovers have no place in banking,'' Rice said
recently. ``They are a severe threat to the stability of the
banking industry and the soundness of the economy.''
   New ground, though, was broken on the regulatory front. For one
thing, the Fed declined to make any distinction between a friendly
or hostile offer in approving Bank of New York's application in
February.
   And in August, the Fed decided to treat foreign owners of U.S.
banks much the same as domestic owners by requiring Instituto per
la Ricostruzione Industriale, the parent of ``white knight'' Banca
Commerciale, to apply separately to the Fed. IRI, which balked at
the idea, is controlled by the Italian government and accounts for
about a quarter of Italy's gross national product.
   Irving attorney Robert Falise, who says he was forced to devote
all his time to the takeover fight, said Irving is negotiating with
``several'' foreign and domestic banks about a possible merger.
However, analysts say if an offer happens to emerge it must be
extremely attractive to win over shareholders at this late date.
   Banca Commerciale had offered $84 a share for 51 percent of
Irving's approximately 18 million common shares outstanding before
withdrawing its bid. The merger proposal was part of a complex
defensive restructuring plan that included sale of Irving assets,
cost-cutting measures and a special cash dividend.
   Bank of New York, which owns about 4.9 percent of Irving, is
offering $15 in cash and 1.575 shares of its own stock for each of
Irving's roughly 18 million common shares outstanding.
   Bacot maintains his bid is just as attracive now as it was a
year ago, although the cash portion has declined significantly. If
he had to do things over again, he'd still bid for Irving, Bacot
said.
   ``We wouldn't have stuck with it that long unless we felt that
way,'' he said. ``It gets a little frustrating. You have to have a
lot of patience.''

   Prices fell on the London Stock Exchange Thursday
in modest trading, with activity again focused on takeover rumors
following Wednesday's bid for Consolidated Gold Fields PLC by
Minorco, which would be the largest ever takeover of a British
company.
   Consolidated Gold Fields' shares, whose sharp gains Wednesday
helped pull the entire market higher, were depressed Thursday as
excitement subsided over Minorco's 2.9 billion-pound, or $4.8
billion, bid.
   But takeover speculation in half a dozen other stocks, sparked
by the move on Consolidated Gold Fields, buoyed the market against
an otherwise bearish tone.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed 8.1
points, or 0.5 percent, lower at 1,788.7.
   Volume dropped to 393.6 million shares from 438.6 million shares
Wednesday.
   Overall, losers among the market's 100 leading shares far
outnumbered gainers, 61 to 22. The declines mirrored the mood on
Wall Street, though late in the London day the Dow Jones industrial
average recovered and pushed to a slight advance.
   Consolidated Gold Fields ended 55 pence lower at 13.45 pounds, a
relatively modest retreat after its 322-pence gain Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Several senators today criticized airline
deregulation and the rash of mergers it has spawned, complaining
they have given large air carriers monopoly power in some parts of
the country and resulted in higher fares but less service.
   ``Simply stated, people are paying more to fly today because the
airlines have developed monopoly hubs,'' declared Sen. Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C., chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.
   He complained that a fare from Washington to Charleston, S.C.,
was $120 in 1977, before airline deregulation, but that recently he
paid $510 for the same trip.
   But the committee at a hearing aimed at examining airline
pricing practices were told by Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley
that air travelers have benefited by the deregulation of the
industry with average air fares declining 13 percent in the last
decade.
   He attributed an average 8 percent increase in domestic air
fares during the first six months of the year to increased costs
for fuel, new aircraft and a number of government-required safety
initiatives.
   As an example of competition benefiting air travelers, Burnley
cited a recent decision by Continental Airlines to offer a $39
off-season fare between the Northeast and Florida.
   Airline deregulation has resulted in ``a substantial improvement
in overall competition'' to the benefit of the public, insisted
Burnley.
   But the explanation didn't satisfy a number of the senators
including Hollings; Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., and Sen. Larry
Pressler, R-S.D., who said fares and service to their parts of the
country have suffered.
   ``It's cheaper to fly across the nation than it is to fly across
South Dakota. That is a very bizarre situation,'' complained
Pressler, who suggested ``some re-regulation'' would be in order
that would require ticket prices to be linked to miles traveled.
   Hollings and Danforth, the ranking Repubican on the committee,
also warned that airline fare and service practices could lead to
some additional government controls on the industry.
   ``In certain airports competition does not exist. Airlines get a
lock on an airport and when they get a lock they can do pretty much
what they please,'' declared Danforth.
   He cited Trans World Airlines dominance at St. Louis where the
airline controls 83 percent of the flights since its merger two
years ago with Ozark Air Line, once its chief competitor. Single
airlines also dominate at Minneapolis, Pittsburgh and Memphis, said
Danforth.
   Burnley, however, defended his department's approval of 21
airline mergers in recent years and maintained that even at the
airports cited by the senators competition has been maintained.
   ``Not only has new entry (by airlines) occurred at each of these
hubs, but competing incumbent carriers continue to provide
competitive service,'' said Burnley.
   But when pressed by Danforth, Burnely said the department has
been disappointed at the level of competition as St. Louis' Lambert
Field since TWA's merger with Ozark.
   He said the department had expected, for example, that Southwest
Airlines would move into the competitive void created by the
TWA-Ozark merger with as many as 60 flights a day instead of the 22
or 23 flights a day it currently operates through St. Louis.
   ``I'd like to know why that has occurred,'' said Burnley,
promising the department would examine the competitive situation at
the airport.

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission ruled today
that the owners of the Seabrook, N.H., nuclear power plant must
prove they could one day pay to shut down the plant if they are to
be allowed to operate.
   The commission voted unanimously to require the owners the
submit a plan within 30 days that shows a ``reasonable assurance
that adequate funding'' would be available for decommissioning the
plant.
   Even if that issue is resolved, the commission still has another
finance-related issue facing it _ whether the owners are
financially qualified to operate the plant.
   Seabrook officials expressed confidence the decommissioning
question would be resolved in their favor.
   ``We're in the process of answering those questions right now
and we're confident this won't be an issue barring us from
low-power testing,'' said Ronald A. Sher, spokesman for the
reactor's owner.
   Two financial problems with Seabrook prompted opponents to
challenge the owners' financial fitness.
   In January, Public Service Company of New Hampshire, the lead
owner of the reactor, filed for bankruptcy reorganization.
   NRC Chairman Lando W. Zech Jr. said last week that the
commission would not approve a low-power license until it was
satisfied Seabrook could run safely despite the bankruptcy
proceedings.
   The second question revolves around the Massachusetts Municipal
Wholesale Electric Co., which in June withdrew from the project and
halted its $2 million-a-month payments. MMWEC owns 12 percent of
the plant and other Seabrook owners are working to secure investors
to cover MMWEC's payments through 1989.
   The idle $5.6 billion reactor is losing $50 million each month
in maintenance and finance costs.
   If granted a low-power license, the reactor could operate at 5
percent of full power and would need to be granted a further permit
to operate at more than 5 percent of capacity.

   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly higher
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade on a late rally that could
mark a key reversal in the markets' recent downward trend, analysts
said.
   Soybean prices swung in a 28-cent range and closed at the day's
highs with the contract for delivery in November at $8.43 a bushel,
5{ cents above Wednesday's final price. Corn and wheat futures also
finished moderately higher.
   ``The market has been liquidating and the first half of session
was spent in what appears now in hindsight to have been the end of
the liquidation,'' said Ted Mao, grain specialist with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Much of the buying apparently was based on indications of
increased global demand for grain and soybeans, particularly by the
Soviet Union. A large purchase this week of U.S. soybean oil by
Pakistan also supported the soybean complex, analysts said.
   ``Today could be a bullish key reversal,'' said Mario Balletto,
soybean market analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New
York.
   At the close, wheat was 5{ cents to 7 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.26{ a bushel; corn was }
cent to 3{ cents higher with December at $2.91 a bushel; oats were
unchanged to 4\ cents higher with December at $2.58\ a bushel;

   Assets of the nation's 452 money market mutual
funds rose $654.2 million in the latest week, the Investment
Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to $267.24 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a revised $347.1 million drop in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $280.02 billion in the week
ended Feb. 24.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 223 general purpose funds fell $102.4 million to $84.82
billion, assets of 103 broker-dealer funds increased $259.7 million
to $113.36 billion, and assets of 126 institutional funds rose
$496.9 million to $69.06 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.42 percent from 7.39 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose, to 7.36 percent from 7.31
percent, Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
unchanged at 34 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
6.01 percent as of Wednesday from 6.00 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged at 5.12 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.72
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 7.70 the
previous week. Yields were 8.03 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 8.00
percent; 8.30 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.28 percent; and
8.58 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.56 percent.

<HEAD>Hunts `Upbeat' Despite Filings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of three Hunts facing a $134 million federal
court judgment did not follow the lead of his brothers in filing
personal bankruptcy petitions because he did not have as much
potential exposure in the claim, a spokesman said Thursday.
   Heirs to one of the world's greatest fortunes, Nelson Bunker and
William Herbert Hunt, two of the multimillionaire Dallas brothers,
filed bankruptcy Wednesday.
   But attorneys say the filings won't affect previous Chapter 11
bankruptcy proceedings involving the brothers' Placid Oil Co.,
owned by their trust estates.
   Jurors in a New York federal court decided Aug. 20 the two
Hunts, their brother Lamar and three other defendants must pay
damages for conspiring in the late 1970s to corner the world's
silver market, and ruining the investments of Minpeco SA, the
Peruvian government's mineral marketing company.
   ``They (the brothers) are very upbeat. There is not anybody
hanging their head over this,'' said a spokesman, Tom Whitaker,
executive vice president for the Hunt Energy Corp.
   He said Lamar Hunt did not file a personal bankruptcy petition
because he does not have the exposure of the other two brothers.
But the spokesman did not rule out the possibility of a later
filing.
   ``It was his (Lamar's) option not to file,'' said Whitaker. ``He
does not have the involvement in the potential silver litigation
that Bunker and Herbert have. He does have some exposure, but not
nearly as much.''
   Whitaker declined to discuss why Lamar Hunt may be less involved
in silver lawsuits than his brothers.
   The Hunts are optimistic about chances of getting a new trial or
having damages reduced in their legal fight with the Peruvian
government's mining company, said Whitaker.
   ``This (reorganization) was a business decision, but they
realized the decision would be painful to themselves and their
family,'' the spokesman said. ``They are absolutely determined to
fight this, what we are calling the outrageous Minpeco verdict.''
   Meanwhile, the Chapter 11 reorganizations will avoid a ``fire
sale'' in the wake of a required $225 million bond to appeal the
court award to Minpeco, said Whitaker.
   U.S. District Judge Morris E. Lasker of New York allowed a
temporary stay against the bond.
   Herbert Hunt, in a statement, said the personal filing will give
him time ``to continue the fight to correct the injustice of the
jury verdict ... . The thought of even a dime going to the
government of Peru is repugnant.''
   The Hunts maintain that Peru, as the second-largest producer of
silver in the world, could only have profited as the silver price
rose.
   A Fort Worth, Texas, bankruptcy attorney who is general counsel
to Placid Oil said he was not surprised by the personal filings.
   ``The ensuing events in the silver market and their results have
made it clear that the individual brothers would have to take some
action to be able to operate their original businesses,'' said
Henry Simon of Simon, Anisman, Doby, Wilson & Skillern.
   Confirmation hearings for Placid, which begin Monday before U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Harold Abramson, should be completed by the end of
next week, he said.
   ``I don't think it (the personal bankruptcy petitions) have any
effect on Placid,'' he said. ``I believe Placid's reorganization
will proceed and it will be a reorganized company.
   ``By the end of next week, we should have confirmation in which
we satisfy that the plan is feasible, that the company can pay for
everything the (U.S.) Bankruptcy Code provides and, regarding
deferred obligations, whether there is a reasonable basis for the
business plan so that creditors who vote for the plan have a
reasonable chance of getting their money,'' said Simon.
   Whitaker said the two Hunts' personal bankruptcy petitions did
not list value of their assets but that, ``as the case proceeds
through the bankruptcy court, those values will be established.''
   However, brief summaries of their assets detailed 13,649
Byzantine coins and 44 pieces of a Roman and Greek bronze
collection for Herbert Hunt. Bunker Hunt's petition noted ancient
coins and ``various art objects and bronze statues.''
   Bunker Hunt listed oil and gas properties in 40 counties
nationwide, three gas plants, 14 ranches, 1,390 acres of raw land,
a condo in Kauai, Hawaii, five cars and a host of other assets, the
Dallas Morning News reported.
   Herbert Hunt listed half-interest in a ski lodge in Vail, Colo.
between one-third and one-fourteenth interest in 3,442 acres in
Louisiana, a 3-year-old Cadillac and a 15-year-old Mercedes Benz,
according to the newspaper.
   Rarely have brothers Bunker, Herbert and Lamar offered public
glimpses of their empire, once valued at some $6 billion. But the
silver crash prompted a $1.6 billion loss for Bunker and Herbert,
who had bought 59 million ounces of silver, once estimated as
one-third of the world's supply.
   Other heavy losses in oil and real estate have, according to
some estimates, cut the trio's wealth to about $1 billion.

   Stock prices gave ground Thursday in selling

performance.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down more than 18
points at its midafternoon low, closed with a 10.49 loss at
2,080.01.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
556 up, 881 down and 518 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 150.67 million

curtailed somewhat by the observance of the Jewish holiday Yom

   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the

   Analysts said the market's uninspired behavior of late

   Coleman Co. rose 3[ to 39[. Analysts said news of the death of

   The gas-guzzlers are back.
   The Environmental Protection Agency's annual survey of auto
gasoline mileage released Thursday shows more models than ever
paying the special gas-guzzler tax on fuel-hungry cars, most of
them expensive European luxury models.
   The mileage champs are unchanged for the fourth straight year.
The top two cars are again Japanese: a General Motors Corp. import
and a Honda.
   In the luxury gas-guzzler category for the first time are two
cars bearing American nameplates, the Cadillac Allante and the
Chrysler TC by Maserati. Both have heavy Italian input _ the
Cadillac's body and more than half the car by value is imported
from Italy and the Chrysler is assembled in Italy using many
U.S-supplied components.
   These are not the first U.S. cars to pay the tax. Chrysler
Corp.'s venerable Chrysler Fifth Avenue and its nearly identical
siblings, the Dodge Diplomat and the Plymouth Fury, were taxed in
the 1987 model year. They return to official guzzler status for
1989, the last year of their production run, after a year with
mileage ratings good enough to take them off the list.
   Many analysts have noted buyer indifference to fuel economy in
recent years of stable or declining gasoline prices.
   The new models, though, reflect an increasing concern with high
performance, according to one observer.
   ``If you have a car in your lineup that does not live up to its
performance image, you're in more trouble today than if you have an
official gas-guzzler,'' said Ed Miller, a senior editor at Ward's
Automotive Publications in Detroit.
   Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety in
Washington, an advocacy group that has frequently opposed
relaxation of government fuel standards, said: ``We are going in
the wrong direction. We ought to be headed the other way and making
gas-sippers.''
   But manufacturers, he said, ``think they'll make more in profits
than they pay in penalties.''
   ``The tax really isn't objected to by the buyer'' of such
luxurious chariots, said Kyle Johnson of GM's Cadillac Division.
``It does not alter GM's commitment to stay away from the
gas-guzzler tax on U.S.-built cars.''
   The guzzlers are proliferating. For 1987, 18 models paid the
tax. Last year, 24 models were taxed. This year 45 models are
assessed, counting five Rolls-Royces that escaped previously
because their gross vehicle weight exceeded 6,000 pounds, the
cutoff specified by the law. The 1986 tax law changes closed that
loophole.
   Other manufacturers with models subject to the tax are Maserati
under its own name, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Aston-Martin,
Jaguar, Volvo and BMW.
   The Geo Metro recorded 53 miles per gallon in the city and 58
mpg on the highway. Geo is the new nameplate from General Motors
Corp. for the various imports of its Chevrolet Division. The Metro,
built by GM's Suzuki Motors affiliate, was sold in previous years
as the Chevrolet Sprint.
   Second place went to the two-seater Honda Civic CRX HF, also for
the fourth year in a row, at 50 mpg city, 56 highway.
   Last year's ratings for the two cars were the same, with the
exception that the Sprint recorded 54 mpg in city traffic.
   Engineers say repeat tests can yield different numbers, and this
variability is probably what happened to the Fifth Avenue family,
said Chrysler Corp.'s Tony Cervone.
   ``The car has not changed,'' he said. Yet in the 1987 model year
it got 16 mpg in the city and 21 mpg on this highway; last year it
was 17-23 and this year it is 16-23.
   The tax, enacted in 1975 to encourage efficiency when fuel
shortages were feared, gradually tightened until reaching its
present form for 1986 models. It is $500, the minimum, for the
Fifth Avenue, Diplomat and Gran Fury.
   The Allante, a $50,000-plus two-seater, got an announced 16 mpg
in the city and 24 mpg on the highway last year and was not taxed.
It fell to 15 mpg city, 23 highway this year with the use of a
larger engine. Buyers _ GM hasn't found many _ will have to pay
$650 more.
   The taxed Chrysler TC by Maserati _ some models escape _ is the
turbocharged version using the 2.5-liter (152 cubic inches) engine
and without top-gear ``lockup'' in the automatic transmission. It
measured 17 mpg in the city and 21 mpg on the highway. Cough up
another $500.
   The most fuel-profligate cars this year are four sports cars
made by the British specialty manufacturer Aston-Martin and being
sold in the United States for the first time, all rated 8-11.
That's worth the top sticker addition of $3,850.
   Another 1975 law requires manufacturers and importers to meet
minimum mileage standards averaged over their fleets, or face heavy
fines. The current standard is 27.5 mpg, calculated from test
results before EPA applies deflation factors to the mileages it
publishes. The Transportation Department is considering a petition
from GM for a lower standard for 1989 and 1990, as the department
permitted for 1986 through 1988.
   The tax applies to 22.5 mpg and below on the same calculation.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Sept. 12, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,037.1 billion in the week ended Sept. 12 from $3,035.7
billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted
$3,853.4 billion from $3,849.5 billion.
   On the other hand, the narrowest measure of the money supply,
M1, fell to a seasonally adjusted $782.1 billion from a revised
$783.1 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M1 averaged $781.6 billion, a 6.1
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks.
   The Fed said in mid-1988 that it reaffirmed its target for
annual growth in M2 and M3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent,
which is slightly lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5
percent. The Fed has not set a specific target range for M1 since
early 1987.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $388 million,
compared with a gain of $358 million a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window averaged $1.24 billion, up
from $552 million.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $283.2 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, up from $281.1 billion two weeks earlier.

   The number of giant profitable corporations
that legally paid no federal income tax was cut by more than half
last year, according to a new study, but backers of the landmark
1986 tax overhaul said Thursday the figure may never drop to zero.
   Sixteen of 250 profitable companies surveyed by Citizens for Tax
Justice were able to wipe out their entire federal liability, down
from 40 in 1986 and 72 in 1982, according to Citizens for Tax
Justice, a Washington-based research group funded by unions,
churches and social groups. Some of the 16 disputed the report.
   Paul Huard, vice president of the National Association of
Manufacturers, criticized the report for what he called ``this
horror-story type of argument.'' It is unfair to look at a
company's taxes for one year only, he said, adding that ``the
nature of corporate profits and tax accounting being what it is,
you are going to get these cyclical variations from year to year.''
   Citizens for Tax Justice said most of the change was caused by
the sweeping law enacted in 1986, which reduced or removed several
individual and corporate deductions and credits while cutting tax
rates.
   ``Tax reform has passed the most critical test of its
effectiveness,'' said Robert McIntyre, director of the organization.
   ``Tax reform may not have have made things less complex ... (or)
cut everyone's tax bill,'' McIntyre told a news conference. ``But
tax reform has made great strides toward a system that puts all
profitable corporations back on the tax rolls. And that should,
over time, help restore public confidence in our tax system.''
   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., and Bill Bradley, D-N.J., key authors
of the 1986 law, voiced the same sentiments. Packwood said he was
surprised that the number of legal tax avoiders had dropped so
quickly.
   Some companies continue to hold ``loss carrybacks,'' which are
excess deductions that are used to wipe out past years' tax
liabilities and generate a current-year refund, Packwood noted. As
those carrybacks are used up, he predicted, the number of companies
paying no tax will continue to dwindle.
   But there may never be a time when every profitable company pays
a tax, he said, because ``companies may come up with things that we
didn't think about'' when writing the law.
   The bigget single corporate tax benefit remains accelerated
depreciation, which permits companies to recapture through the tax
system part of the money spent for plant and equipment.
   The report listed these 16 companies as having paid no federal
income tax last year: General Motors, IBM, Aetna Life & Casualty,
Baxter Travenol Laboratories, Carolina Power & Light, Illinois
Power, Corning, Hewlett-Packard, Ashland Oil, Greyhound, Ogden,
Sequa Corp., Pennzoil, Goodyear Tire & Rubber, Consumers Power and
Gulf States Utilities.
   All but Gulf States actually received refunds last year of
past-year taxes, the report said. General Motors, largely due to
increased depreciation of automaking equipment, received $742
million, while IBM received $123.5 million, in large part because
of large tax payments to foreign countries, the report said.
   GM spokesman John Hartnett disputed the report's findings with
regard to the auto company, saying GM paid $73 million in federal
income taxes in 1987. He said the company's 1987 tax liability was
less than in past years ``because of our nominal U.S. operating
profit, our heavy investment in new and renovated plants and other
factors.''
   ``The report ... is wrong in saying that IBM paid no federal
income tax last year,'' said IBM spokesman Marti Easterbrook. While
the company will receive a refund, she said, ``our net tax payment
(afer the refund) will be in the millions of dollars.''
   Elizabeth Krupnick, a spokesman for Aetna, denied the report's
allegation that the giant insurer received a $32 million refund.
``We sent in a check for $17 million and got no refund,'' she said.
   The annual survey of corporate taxes is based chiefly on
stockholder reports filed by 250 of the nation's largest profitable
corporations. The report deals only with taxes paid to the U.S.
government during a given tax year and does not accout for
deferrals that could fall due in a future year.
   Thus, an international company with large tax payments to
foreign governments could be listed as paying no U.S. taxes, as
could one that bought a large amount of equipment last year,
resulting in a deferral of liability.
   Among key findings:
   _The 250 paid $9 billion more in federal income last year than
they would have paid under the old law.
   _As a group, the 250 companies last year paid $27 billion in
taxes on profits of $123 billion, a 22 percent rate. Five years
earlier, they paid less than 12 percent on $87 billion net earnings.
   _The 14 largest corporations that paid no taxes in 1982 through
1985 paid at an effective rate of 30 percent last year. This list
included AT&T, DuPont, Boeing and Dow Chemical.
   _The 128 corporations that were off the federal tax rolls in at
least one year from 1981 through 1985 paid an average rate of 19.5
percent last year. Their average rate in 1981-85 was 3.7 percent.
   _The combined effective tax rate on the 250 corporations in the
survey rose from 14.9 percent in 1981-85 to 22.1 percent in 1987.
Their combined profits averaged $102 billion in each of the earlier
years and $123 billion last year.
   _The number of giant profitable companies paying a tax rate of
less than 10 percent has been cut in half, to 55.
   _About two-thirds of the 250 companies are paying a higher tax
rate than before the new law was enacted. About one-fifth are
paying a lower rate.

   Members of a Senate committee on Thursday
faulted airline deregulation for raising airfares for many
Americans and leaving some cities dominated by carriers that
control local air service.
   But Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley told the Senate
Commerce Committee that even though ``the airline industry has its
flaws,'' nearly 10 years of deregulation has benefited most
travelers.
   ``Overall the airline industry has become much more competitive
as to price and service as a result of economic deregulation,''
Burnley told the legislators.
   Burnley cited statistics showing that since 1978, domestic air
traffic has grown from 275 million passengers to more than 450
million, while average fares have declined 13 percent, adjusted for
inflation.
   The secretary said that if most Americans are asked if
deregulation has been helpful, ``You'll find an overwhelming
perception that the country has benefited enormously.''
   Burnley's defense, however, did little to ease the concerns of
members of the committee, many of whom come from sparsely populated
states.
   ``My fares have zoomed up, up and away, and my service has gone
down,'' said Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., chairman of the panel.
   Hollings said it now costs him $510 to fly from Charleston,
S.C., to Washington, compared with $120 in 1977, before
deregulation, which marks its 10th anniversary next month.
   Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., said it costs $269 to fly from
Aberdeen, S.D., to Rapid City, S.D., while a Washington to Los
Angeles ticket can cost $239.
   ``That is a very bizarre result,'' he said. ``Our small cities
and towns are really suffering from this thing.''
   Sen. John Danforth of Missouri, ranking Republican on the
committee, also complained that some airlines have been able to
dominate air traffic so thoroughly in individual cities that
``competition doesn't really exist.''
   He said Congress must determine ``whether deregulation is truly
working and if it's not working, what are we supposed to do about
it.''
   With the 1986 merger between Trans World Airlines and Ozark Air
Lines, TWA controls 82 percent of traffic at Lambert-St. Louis
International Airport. A report released Tuesday by the General
Accounting Office, an investigating arm of Congress, found that
after the merger, the number of St. Louis routes served by two or
more carriers fell from 64 to 36, while TWA fares from the city
grew by 13 percent to 18 percent.
   Alfred E. Kahn, who was chief of the now-defunct Civil
Aeronautics Board in 1978 when deregulation was created, told the
senators that ``the airline industry is today far more competitive
than it was under regulation.''
   To deal with problems faced by cities dominated by individual
airlines, he suggested tougher enforcement of antitrust laws when
airline mergers are being considered, allowing foreign airlines to
purchase American carriers, and taxing frequent flyer tickets to
discourage repeated use of the same airline.
   When deregulation began, advocates argued that airlines would
not be able to charge excessively high fares because competitors
would be spawned who would set lower prices.
   But critics have argued that it has been difficult for new
airlines to start up because of the high costs involved and the
lack of available space at many airports. Competition has also been
diminished by the 26 airline mergers since 1985, and the increased
dominance by individual carriers at certain airports across the
country.
   Both sides in the dispute generally agree that deregulation has
benefited vacation travelers who are able to take advantage of the
proliferation of discount fares. But passengers who must fly with
insufficient advance notice or on inflexible schedules and those
flying between small communities often find it difficult to find
bargain fares.
   With Congress planning to adjourn next month, it is unlikely
that any legislation directed at the problems cited will be passed
this year. But lawmakers' comments made it clear that airline
deregulation is likely to come under close scrutiny when Congress
returns in January.

   The Soviet Union is opening its doors to
the once-feared copying machine through joint ventures with U.S.
partners.
   Two copying ventures announced this week were hailed as
landmarks in the policies of glasnost and perestroika, or openness
and restructuring, begun by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   AlphaGraphics Printshops of the Future, a Tucson, Ariz.-based
chain of more than 250 print shops, announced on Thursday in New
York that it plans to open its first two shops in Moscow this
winter.
   AlphaGraphics said it will have two full-service shops that will
primarily serve foreign businesses, members of the diplomatic press
corps, Soviet government agencies and citizens who have access to
hard currency.
   A day earlier, California businessman Martin B. Lopata held a
news conference at the Soviet Consulate in San Francisco to
announce plans to open kiosks in 18 hotels in Moscow this winter.
   The kiosks will offer overnight copying and printing services as
well as selling computers and software, audio-visual products,
advertising advice and American souvenirs, books and magazines,
Lopata said.
   The Soviet Union has long exercised tight control over access to
copiers, duplicating machines and printing presses, all of which
are owned by the state. Lack of access to such services has been an
obstacle to the many unofficial newspapers and journals that have
sprung up under glasnost.
   ``It's a very, very major political advance,'' said Jerry Hough,
a Soviet expert at Duke University. ``(Copying) machines have been
under lock and key and it's been virtually illegal for most people
to make copies in the Soviet Union.''
   Laura Frazer, program officer at the U.S. Information Agency in
Washington, called the venture ``extremely radical because even
most Soviet government bureaucrats do not have access to copying
machines.''
   AlphaGraphics is planning larger and more complete copying
operations than Lopata, who plans to use the kiosks as collection
points for copying that will be done at a central location.
   A 50-pound document that would cost $600 to $700 and take four
days or so to ship from Washington, D.C., to Moscow could be sent
electronically and printed at an AlphaGraphics shop for about $30,
without danger of being stuck in customs, said Rodger Ford, the
president and founder.
   Lopata said he sees his venture as a starting point for a wide
variety of businesses.
   ``This is a truly pioneering event,'' Lopata told a crowded news
conference Wednesday. ``This will also be one of the first
facilities to allow printing to the average Soviet citizen.''
   Lopata said the new business will be open to all Soviets,
charging rubles and dollars. Plans are to open offices in Moscow in
January, Leningrad next summer and Kiev a few months later, he said.
   The joint venture is an outgrowth of the Gorbachev-Reagan Moscow
summit meeting earlier this year, said Soviet Deputy Consul General
Gennadiy I. Zolotov.
   Lopata's Unicorn Investments International is in a venture with
MIR, the Soviet publishing house, and the Soviet cooperative Sintez.
   Dubbed Sovaminco, standing for Soviet-American International
Co., the business was registered as a legal entity this week in
Moscow, said Zolotov and Lopata. The company is jointly owned by
MIR, Sintez and Unicorn.
   AlphaGraphics' franchisee, Toronto-based Phargo Management and
Consulting Ltd., is in a venture with Kniga Publishing House of
Moscow.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises; Gold Prices Mixed</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS Tuesday to Wednesday in 2nd graf.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar gained ground in quiet trading
Thursday despite a bout of central bank intervention.
   Gold prices fell overseas but recovered somewhat in domestic
dealings. Republic National Bank of New York quoted bullion at $399
a troy ounce, up from $396.35 late Wednesday, when the metal slid
below the $400-an-ounce level for the first time in the United
States since early last year.
   Dealers attributed the rise in domestic gold prices to technical
factors.
   Trading in currency markets was dull. Dan Holland, a vice
president at Discount Corp., said the Federal Reserve intervened
when the dollar topped 1.88 West German marks. Because the market
was thin, ``it didn't take much to turn the dollar around,'' he
said.
   Many dealers were waiting on the sidelines for Saturday's
meeting of the leading industrialized democracies. While no policy
changes are expected to result from the Group of Seven gathering in
West Berlin, a cloud of caution still hung over the markets.
   The G-7 nations include the United States, West Germany, Japan,
France, Great Britain, Italy and Canada.
   Trading the yen remained paralyzed due to the serious illness of
Japanese Emperor Hirohito. ``When (he) dies, Tokyo will shut down
the markets for two days, and then it will be difficult to close
on's yen positions,'' said a dealer at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar rose 0.29 Japanese yen to a closing 134.47 yen. Later in
London, it fell to 134.45 yen. In New York, the dollar rose to
134.69 yen from 134.29 yen on Wednesday.
   The dollar gained against the British pound. In London it cost
$1.6675 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.6755 late Wednesday.
Later in New York, it cost $1.6702 to buy one pound, less expensive
than Wednesday's $1.6738.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.8763 West German marks, up from
1.8745; 1.5851 Swiss francs, up from 1.5820; 6.3860 French francs,
up from 6.3650; 1,399.25 Italian lire, up from 1.395.75, and 1.2187
Canadian dollars, up from 1.2159.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.8790 West German marks, up from
1.8748; 1.5870 Swiss francs, up from 1.5833; 6.3955 French francs,
up from 6.3710; 2.1150 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1145; 1,401.50
Italian lire, up from 1,395.60; 1.2188 Canadian dollars, up from
1.2183.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
rose to $399.30 a troy ounce from $398.40 on Wednesday.
   But gold prices in Europe mirrored Wednesday's plunge in the
United States, closing below the $400-an-ounce level. Traders in
Zurich described the market as ``panicked and frenzied.''
   Gold finished in London at a late bid price of $397.75 a troy
ounce, compared with late Wednesday's $401.50. In Zurich, gold
dropped to a bid of $397, compared with $400.50 late Wednesday.
Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.96 to close at a bid $402.42.
   Silver for current delivery finished at $6.250 a troy ounce on
the New York Comex, up from $6.177 on Wednesday. In London, the
metal was quoted at a late bid price of $6.24 a troy ounce,
compared with Wednesday's $6.22.

<HEAD>Late Rally Called Key Reversal For Grain Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A late rally that pushed grain and soybean futures prices higher
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade could mark a key reversal in
the market's recent downward trend, analysts said.
   On other markets, gold struggled back to $400 an ounce; copper
surged; frozen pork bellies rose sharply while livestock futures
were mixed; energy futures were mostly higher; and stock-index
futures retreated.
   Soybeans for November delivery, which had traded as high as
$9.03{ a bushel just one week earlier, swung in a 28-cent range
Thursday, plunging to $8.15 but settling near the day's high at
$8.42, 4{ cents above Wednesday's final price.
   Corn and wheat futures also finished moderately higher but were
less volatile due to the supportive influence of new export
business, analysts said.
   ``The (soybean) market liquidated early until there just wasn't
any selling left below $8.20. Then the strength in the wheat and
corn really supported the bean complex,'' said Pat O'Connell, a
grain analyst with Refco Inc., a Chicago futures brokerage.
   ``I think the market told us today that it's in good shape,'' he
said.
   Ted Mao, grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in
New York, said the drop to $8.15 ``appears now in hindsight to have
been the end of the liquidation,'' he said.
   ``Today could be a bullish key reversal,'' agreed Mario
Balletto, soybean market analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
in New York.
   Much of the buying apparently was based on indications of
increased global demand for grain and soybeans, particularly by the
Soviet Union. A large purchase this week of U.S. soybean oil by
Pakistan also supported the soybean complex, analysts said.
   Talk that the United States and the Soviet Union were nearing
agreement on a new long-term grain agreement further fueled the
rally, analysts said.
   Wheat settled 5{ cents to 6} cents higher with the December
contract at $4.26{ a bushel; corn was } cent to 3{ cents higher
with December at $2.91\ a bushel; oats were unchanged to 4\ cents
higher with December at $2.58\ a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent lower
to 5\ cents higher with November at $8.42 a bushel.
   Silver futures posted solid gains on New York's Commodity
Exchange and gold for October delivery rallied to $400 a troy
ounce, the psychologically important level the contract had
breached a day earlier.
   ``My gut feeling is that there's not much of any significance
here,'' said Jack Barbanel, director of futures trading for Gruntal
& Co. in New York.
   He said the inflation-sensitive gold market reacted to higher
grain prices but that the lack of strong inflationary signals would
continue to depress speculative buying.
   Buying could surface below $390 a troy ounce, a level that gold
is likely to reach within two or three weeks, he said.
   Gold settled 60 cents to 80 cents higher with October at $400 a
troy ounce; silver was 7.1 cents to 7.3 cents higher with September
at $6.25 a troy ounce.
   Copper futures soared on the Commodity Exchange, resuming a
month-long upward trend linked to tight supplies and growing
demand, analysts said.
   Copper settled 1.8 cents to 3.05 cents higher with September at
$1.1535, a new lifetime high for that contract.
   Frozen pork belly futures surged as much as 1.82 cents a pound
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in a technical rally in the
absence of fresh supply-and-demand factors, analysts said.
   Hog futures were mostly higher in anticipation of a heavy
weekend kill and cattle futures were mixed. The bearish effect of
weaker cash cattle markets was offset by expectations for higher
cash prices, analysts said.
   Live cattle settled .40 cent lower to .43 cent higher with
October at 69.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .55 cent lower
to .02 cent higher with September at 79.20 cents a pound; hogs were
unchanged to .57 cent higher with October at 39.25 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .95 cent to 1.82 cents higher with
February at 52.15 cents a pound.
   Oil futures prices ended mostly higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange as the market awaited this weekend's OPEC price
committee meeting.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents to 9 cents
higher with November at $14.65 a barrel; heating oil was .03 cent
lower to .07 cent higher with October at 41.06 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .10 cent lower to .50 cent higher with
October at 45.85 cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of stocks on the
Standard & Poor's 500 index settled 1.2 points lower at 272.10.

<HEAD>Bond Prices End Slightly Lower</HEAD>

   Bond prices finished slightly lower Thursday in
sporadic trading, failing to sustain their early gains of the
session.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year issue slipped \ point, or
$2.50 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves
inversely to its price and is often an indicator of interest rate
trends, rose to 9.03 percent from 9.01 percent late Wednesday.
   Analysts said bond prices advanced early in the trading day in
response to Wednesday's positive news on inflation, but lost ground
later as gold prices rebounded.
   The government reported Wednesday that while consumer prices
rose 0.4 percent in August, inflation remained in check at the same
5.2 percent annual rate as in July.
   ``That makes bonds look good,'' said John Sebastian, executive
vice president of Clayton Brown & Associates, an investment firm in
Chicago.
   Gold prices continued to slump early in the session, trading
below $400 a troy ounce. The news on consumer prices and the fall
in gold were positive for bond prices, because they indicate an
absence of inflationary pressures.
   But the bond market's early gains soon were eroded when gold
recovered, analysts said. The metal finished in New York at around
$399 an ounce, up from $396.35 late Wednesday.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues slipped 1-32 point to 3-32 point, intermediate
maturities declined 3-32 point to 3-16 point, and 20-year issues
were down \ point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial
information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, fell 1.48 to 1,143.46.
   Meanwhile, corporate bonds inched higher. Moody's Investment
Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, was up
0.09 at 290.13.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills, meanwhile, rose 2 basis
points to 7.41 percent and a discount rate of 7.19 percent. Yields
on six-month bills jumped 5 basis points to 7.78 percent and a
discount of 7.40 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose 3 basis
points to 8.05 percent and a discount rate of 7.52 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 8 5-16 percent, down from 8~
percent late Wednesday.

   Senate Democrats failed Thursday to break a
Republican filibuster of a bill clouded in presidential politics to
raise the $3.35 an hour minimum wage for the first time since 1981.
   On a 53-43 vote _ seven short of the 60 needed _ the Senate
refused to limit to 30 more hours debate on legislation by Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., to raise the wage floor to $3.75 in
January, $4.15 in 1990 and $4.55 in 1991.
   ``It's only clear that there is a deliberate attempt to stall
action on this bill,'' said Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd,
D-W.Va., who called the Republican tactics a filibuster.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the leader of the Republican
opposition to any increase in the minimum wage that does not
include a subminimum wage for new hires, said the issue needs
extended debate.
   ``I know a little bit about filibustering and I've certainly led
my share around here,'' Hatch said. ``But I only lead them on very,
very important issues where we really have to have extended debate
or what I would call extended educational dialogue. This particular
bill needs a lot of that.''
   Hatch a week ago introduced the first Republican amendment in
the debate _ a 90-day, 80 percent subminimum wage applicable to all
new hires.
   As a parlimentary tactic, Kennedy immediately offered a
substitute amendment slightly expanding a currently allowed but
little used 85 percent subminimum wage for full-time students who
work no more than 20 hours a week.
   Since then, there have been no votes in five days of debate.
   Under the Senate's rules, approval of Kennedy's substitute would
effectively kill what Republicans call a subminimum training wage
that President Reagan and Vice President George Bush have coupled
to their approval of any incease in the $3.35 wage floor.
   ``We're not going to get a fair hearing on the training wage
because the labor leaders don't want it,'' said Senate Republican
Leader Bob Dole of Kansas. ``It's not the Republicans versus the
Democrats; it's the Republicans versus the labor leaders. They're
telling us we can take this or leave it; we're not going to play
that game.''
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said Republicans supporting the
filibuster ``obviously know that the presidential nominee of their
party, George Bush, wasn't serious when he told Americans he wanted
an increase in the minimum wage.''
   Bush has declined to specify in the past two weeks how a big an
increase in the minimum wage he could support, saying any raise
should be coupled to a subminimum training wage.
   His vice presidential running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind.,
this week again mentioned a raise to $4 over two years, a proposal
he submitted to the Senate Labor Committee two months ago.
   Byrd scheduled a second cloture vote for Friday in an effort to
break the logjam amid indications that some of the support for the
filibuster may be waning.
   ``We may not be successful tomorrow, but we're going to try,''
Dole said.
   Three Republicans _ Sens. Lowell Weicker of Connecticut, William
Roth of Delaware and John Chafee of Rhode Island _ joined 50
Democrats in Thursday's vote to end the filibuster.
   Three Democrats _ Sens. James Exon of Nebraska, David Boren of
Oklahoma and Richard Shelby of Alabama _ joined Republians in
voting to allow it to continue.
   ``It's an open secret in the Senate that the White House has
asked the Republicans to vote in favor of a filibuster,'' Kennedy
said. ``And the White House has asked them to keep on voting for a
filibuster tomorrow and next week.''
   Kennedy and other supporters of a minimum wage increase say it
would only restore the 30 percent loss of purchasing power that
inflation has taken away from workers on that ``bottom rung'' since
it was last raised in 1981.
   Proponents said the raise will directly benfit some 15 million
workers now paid below $4.55 an hour.
   Hatch, however, said only about 2 million of the minimum wage
earners are what he called ``working poor'' heads of households.
   ``The minimum wage really is irrelvevant except that by pushing
up the bottom some 38 percent ... every other wage scale in the
country has to go up correspondingly, and the cost of every good
and service in this country has to go up correspondingly,'' he said.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that raising the
minimum wage would increase the rate of inflation by 0.2 to 0.3
percentage points a year. Inflation so far the first eight months
of 1988 is running at 4.6 percent.

<HEAD>State, Oil Services Companies Agree to Judgment in Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Texas attorney general's office has agreed to
a judgment dissolving the state's suit to block the acquisition of
Gearhart Industries Inc. by Halliburton Co., the companies said
Thursday.
   State District Judge Sharolyn Wood of Houston signed the final
judgment Thursday.
   ``They (the companies) agreed to this final judgment which
requires Gearhart to continue servicing the smaller clients they
had in the past _ the clients we were concerned about,'' said Ron
Dusek, spokesman for Attorney General Jim Mattox. ``That was one of
our main goals, to ensure that services to these smaller clients
were continued.''
   The attorney general's office, after reviewing state antitrust
laws, had obtained a temporary restraining order in an Austin court
against the $305 million merger plan.
   The case was transferred to state district court in Houston so
it could be decided by Friday, when some Gearhart creditors had the
right to withdraw their consent to the merger.
   ``We decided to withdraw our case,'' said Dusek, adding that the
antitrust questions no longer existed. ``There is an agreed, final
judgment.''
   Mattox had contended the merger would eliminate competition in
the wireline services industry.
   The attorney general's challenge came only days after
Halliburton had reached a final agreement on the merger with
Gearhart debtholders and creditors.
   The merger also had won the approval of Gearhart shareholders
and the U.S. Justice Department.
   Gearhart, a struggling Fort Worth-based oilfield services
company that employs 7,000 people worldwide, said it would file for
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings
if the merger was not completed.
